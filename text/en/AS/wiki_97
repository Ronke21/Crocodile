<text>Glen Rose is a city in and the county seat of Somervell County, Texas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 2,659.

==History==

===19th century===
The area was first settled in 1849 by Charles Barnard, who opened a trading post near Comanche Peak. After the region became a federal Indian Reservation in 1855, Barnard moved his business to Fort Belknap. &quot;&quot; 1859 when the reservation was abolished, he returned to the area and built the first store on what is now the site of Glen Rose.

A three-story stone gristmill was constructed along the Paluxy River and the town that grew up around it became known as Barnard&#x27;s Mill. The mill was sold to Tyler Calhoun Jordan of Dallas in 1871 for $65,000. Tradition states that Jordan&#x27;s wife, a native of Scotland, decided to rename the town Rose Glen to reflect the area&#x27;s natural surroundings, although census records show that she was a native of Alabama. The citizens later voted to call the community &quot;Glen Rose&quot;. A post office opened in 1874.

When Somervell County was formed on March 15, 1875, Glen Rose was designated as its county seat. A Baptist college was organized in 1879 and was later sold to the Paluxy Baptist Association. In 1889, the northern Presbyterians opened Glen Rose Collegiate Institute (also known as Glen Rose College), which remained in operation for the next 15 to 20 years. A courthouse around Glen Rose&#x27;s town square was completed around 1892, but burned down a year later. A newly built Romanesque Revival style courthouse was constructed soon after with locally quarried limestone. That building sustained damage in a 1902 tornado that also damaged part of the town square.

===20th century===
From the 1900s to the 1920s, Glen Rose was home to approximately 1,000 people. The area&#x27;s mineral springs attracted numerous doctors and self-styled healers. During Prohibition, the area was a center of moonshining, and Glen Rose became known as the &quot;whiskey woods capital of the state&quot;. The population remained steady during the Great Depression, although unemployment rates in both Glen Rose and Somervell County increased. As part of the New Deal, Glen Rose borrowed $80,000 under the Public Works Administration (PWA) to construct a new water and sewage system. Three low-water dams on the Paluxy River, several local school buildings, and a canning plant were built with Works Projects Administration (WPA) money.

Somervell County&#x27;s population declined from 3,071 in 1940 to 2,542 in 1950 as many residents moved in search of greater employment opportunities. At the same time, Glen Rose&#x27;s population grew from 1,050 in 1940 to 1,248 in 1950. The construction of the Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant in the mid-1970s brought financial advantages and new residents to the area. The city&#x27;s population rose 34 percent between 1970 and 1980. The nuclear plant dominated the local economy. Other chief industries include farming, ranching, and tourism. 111 rated businesses were in Glen Rose as of 1991. By 2000, its population had grown to 2,122 and the total number of rated businesses rose to 224.

Homes with no foundations, no floors, no windows, doors, or walls were scattered throughout&quot; the community. Grinberg added that &quot;strong winds stirred up suffocating clouds of dust in the streets&quot; because all of the streets were unpaved. She added that &quot;[s]mall gullies formed when it rained because there was no drainage system. Gangs of teens prowled the area, burning unattended construction sites, stealing TVs or the few households appliances people owned&quot;. As of 2011, residents are increasingly gaining basic services.

<text>Rio Grande City is a city in and the county seat of Starr County, Texas, United States. The population was 15,317 at the time of the 2020 census. The city is west of McAllen. It is connected to Camargo, Tamaulipas, via the Rio Grande City–Camargo International Bridge.

The city is situated within the Rio Grande Valley. It holds March record for high temperature for the United States at .

==History==
The area around Rio Grande City was first settled by Spanish colonists on the southern bank of the river as Camargo. The northern bank became more densely settled after the Mexican-American War and United States&#x27; annexation of the territory.

In 1846 the northern bank was gradually developed still under the name Camargo. It was used by the US Army as a supply depot for its invading Mexico as part of the Mexican–American War. The area was strategic as the furthest point up the Rio Grande that was navigable and regularly accessible to the era&#x27;s steamboats.

During the early stages of the war, US soldier Henry Clay Davis married Hilaria de la Garza Falcon, a resident of Camargo south of the river. She was heiress to the land on the north side of the river that was developed as Rio Grande City. At the end of the war, Davis set out to organize this area into a formal city; he divided the land into plots to be sold.

At first, the area was referred to as . He and other developers changed the name to Rio Grande City to attract Anglo-American investors and settlers. From its founding in 1848 until the Texas Mexican Railroad opened up in 1883, Rio Grande City was one of the most significant hubs of trade between Texas and Mexico. In addition, because of its prominence and exploits by local residents, it was part of the romanticized concept in the United States of the &quot;Wild West&quot;.

Famous early residents include Joshua H. Bean, brother of Judge Roy Bean, and the first mayor of San Diego, California; Orlando C. Phelps, one of the few surviving members of the Mier Expedition; Edwin R. Rainwater, hero of the Texas Revolution; Edward R. Hord, an influential early South Texas statesman; and John L. Haynes, a native Virginian politician and writer who was a strong proponent of Mexican-American (Tejano) rights and outspoken anti-secessionist before the Civil War.

Rio Grande City has conserved some of its older structures, and has a designated historic district.

Among its contributing structures is the La Borde House, which dates to 1899. La Borde was a French riverboat trader and merchant who commissioned the mansion&#x27;s design in Paris. He had this refined by architects in San Antonio, Texas, and oversaw construction of the building along Main Street.

The large house was renovated around the early 1980s, nearly 100 years later. It is now operated as a hotel, complete with a parlor, patio, parlor, shaded verandas, and restaurant.

In the 1970s and into the 1980s, federal law enforcement officials concentrated their anti-drug smuggling efforts on Starr County.

In spite of Rio Grande City&#x27;s rich architectural heritage, many buildings in the old downtown district are abandoned, dilapidated, or crumbling. While there are a good number of small shops and businesses operating in the district, most new development and commerce takes place in new shopping centers outside of the old downtown neighborhood.

In May 1993, Rio Grande City was officially incorporated as a municipal corporation (i.e. city).

===Fort Ringgold===
Ringgold Barracks were established at Davis Landing on 26 October 1848 by the 1st US Infantry under the command of Captain J.H. La Motte, in honor of Major Ringgold, who was mortally wounded at the Battle of Palo Alto. Troops were withdrawn on 3 March 1859 but reoccupied again on 29 December 1859 during the Cortina War.

The fort was abandoned again at the start of the Civil War in 1861, but reoccupied by US forces in 1865. The fort was active until 1944 when the property was sold to the Rio Grande City public schools system. Units stationed here included the 1st Infantry (Mounted Dragoons), 7th and 28th Infantry Regiments, 3rd Texas Volunteers, the 9th, 10th and 12th Cavalry Regiments, the 9th and 10th being composed of Buffalo Soldiers.

The original parade ground is maintained, and several post buildings survive to be used as school facilities. These include the sentry and guard houses, barracks, officers quarters, bakery, hospital and post headquarters, situated along Ringgold Avenue, Lee Circle, 12th Cavalry and F Troop streets. The Rio Grande City United States Army Reserve Center is the only remaining military presence at the Fort Ringgold area.

<text>Roma is a city in Starr County, Texas, United States. Its population was 11,561 at the 2020 census. The city is located along the Rio Grande, across from Ciudad Miguel Alemán in Tamaulipas, Mexico. The city is also popularly known as Roma-Los Saenz, since the incorporated city also took the area known as Los Saenz. It serves as a port of entry from Mexico into the U.S. via the Roma–Ciudad Miguel Alemán International Bridge.

==Sights==
The town center has a number of picturesque historic buildings, now collected in the Roma Historic District.

Roma is a popular birding site in the Rio Grande Valley, and a section of the World Birding Center is on Portsheller Street across from the city hall.

The channel of the Rio Grande is less than 200 feet wide at Roma. The bluff adjacent to the town square overlooks the river, and parts of the Ciudad Miguel Aleman crossing are readily visible. Because of the arresting views, this location is frequently used by television journalists, public officials, and others who visit the region as a photo op to visualize the border region.

==History==

Roma was established in 1821 in what had been the Spanish province of Nuevo Santander.

Prior to Texas&#x27;s independence from Mexico in 1836, the town was listed as under the jurisdiction of the town of Mier, Tamaulipas, and prior to Mexican independence existed under Spanish rule.

The site offered a convenient crossing on the Rio Grande, which became known as &quot;El Paso de la Mula&quot; (Pass of the Mule). The area was notable for a salt trade from the Roma area to Monterrey. The Roma area became the Mexican state of Tamaulipas with the Mexican Constitution of 1824. Texas claimed Roma with the establishment of the Republic of Texas in 1835, but Mexico continued to control this area. A Texan force sought to take Roma in the Mier Expedition of 1842, which resulted in the death, capture, or execution of many volunteers.

After the Mexican–American War established U.S. control over the northern bank of the Rio Grande in 1846, Texas governed Roma. During the American Civil War, the region became wealthy on the cotton trade, which was transshipped via Mexico to Europe. While steamboats were able to access Roma through the mid-19th century, lowering water levels as a result of development upstream ended river shipment by the 1880s. Bypassed by railroads, Roma stagnated and inadvertently preserved itself from development.

The Roma National Historic Landmark District contains over 30 structures built before 1900. Some of those buildings include:
* The Customs House (Casa de Aduanas, in Spanish) is where shippers and brokers came to pay customs fees for imported goods from Europe and Mexico on steamboats.
* The John Vale/Noah Cox House was built in 1853 by Swedish immigrant John Vale; its front elevation has finely carved sandstone with classical details on the cornice.
* the Leocadia Garcia House, built in the 1840s, served first as a dwelling for José Maria Garcia, husband of Leocadia, and then as a store and dance hall.
* Ramirez Hall is the two-story home of Lino Ramirez and three generations of the Ramirez family. Built by architect Heinrich Portscheller, who personally laid brick around windows and doors, it was used as fictitious &quot;Rosita&#x27;s Cantina&quot; in the 1950s film &quot;Viva Zapata&quot;.
* The Manuel Guerra Building is the crown jewel of restored buildings in Roma.
* The Néstor Saenz Store has direct access to the wharf area, just below Juarez Street, where steamboats anchored.
* The Edward Hord Office was built in 1853 for Edward R. Hord, who represented Mexican heirs of original landowners in the area, and during the Civil War, functioned as a military building,
* The Filomeno Gongora House, built from sandstone blocks, was erected around the 1830s, the oldest house in Roma.
* Our Lady of Refuge Church was built in 1853 by Father Pierre Yves Kéralum (1817–1872), a carpenter-turned-priest of the Oblates.
* The Parish Hall housed the convent of the Sisters of the Incarnate Word (1880s–1913) and the Sisters of Mercy (1813–1940).

<text>Sonora is a city in and the county seat of Sutton County, Texas, United States. The population was 2,502 at the 2020 census.

==Geography and climate==


Sonora is located at (30.568166, –100.644163).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.0 square miles (5.1 km), all land.

The area lies in west Texas, bordering the Texas Hill Country on the east. It is a region of limestone outcrops and rolling terrain dotted with areas of mostly smaller, clump-forming or mottes of live oaks (&quot;Quercus fusiformis&quot;) and juniper (&quot;Juniperus ashei&quot;), as an open savanna grading into a closed savanna or woodland to the east, alternating with a blend of various grasses, shrubs, and cacti.

Sonora&#x27;s climate is semi-arid, warm temperate but humid continental, though periods of long drought are not uncommon due to the influence of deserts to the west. The upland location allows some of the periodic Gulf of Mexico moisture to interact with frontal systems and elevated terrain, to create more clouds and precipitation than locations in the brush country to the south, or drier areas to the west and northwest. Thunderstorms with heavy rainfall are most frequent during spring and fall months, though some lighter, steady precipitation and low clouds can occur during the winter, due in large part to frontal systems originating on the plains and prairies to the north.

Summers are long and hot, often with higher humidity, though a breeze often moderates the heat. Fall through spring months are often pleasant, though winter can experience brief periods of cold or cloudy weather.

<doc id="136632" wikidata="Q974357" url="?curid=136632" title="Tulia, Texas">
<text>Tulia is a city in and the county seat of Swisher County, Texas, United States. The population was 4,967 at the 2010 census; by the 2020 census, it had fallen to 4,473. The city is at the junction of U.S. Route 87 and Texas State Highway 86, about east of Interstate 27. Tulia is a center for farming and agribusiness activities.

==History==
Its site was originally on the acreage of the Tule Ranch division of the JA Ranch. In 1887, a post office was established in James A. Parrish&#x27;s dugout on Middle Tule Draw, west of what is now the site of Tulia. Evidently, the name Tule, after the nearby creek, had been selected for this post office, but at some point a clerk&#x27;s error changed the name to Tulia. By 1900, Tulia was prospering as a stopping point for freight-wagon traffic en route to the railheads of Colorado City and Amarillo. A booming new era began with the extension of the Santa Fe line to Tulia in December 1906; with it came more settlers. In the mid-1980s, local industrial plants manufactured products such as clothing and farm implements, and four large cattle-feeding enterprises were nearby.

===1999 drug arrest scandal===
In July 1999, the town of Tulia gained national attention due to its involvement in the controversial war on drugs. Undercover Officer Tom Coleman conducted a sting operation that led to forty-seven citizens accused of dealing cocaine, equating to ten to twenty percent of the African American population being incarcerated.

Despite being tried, convicted, and sentenced to decades in prison, a group of attorneys led by Amarillo civil rights attorney Jeff Blackburn and Vanita Gupta from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, ultimately succeeded in having the defendants released. In 2003 Texas Governor Rick Perry granted full pardons to thirty-five of the Tulia defendants. In 2005, Coleman was convicted of perjury and sentenced to 10 years&#x27; probation and a fine.

=== Tax rollback of 2005 ===
In 2004, the Bedford city council determined that after years of cost-cutting, a property tax increase would be necessary. The council adopted a higher tax rate, but it triggered a tax rollback election in March 2005. The rollback provision passed and the city council revised the budget immediately due to the lack of funds, cutting city services including swimming pools, recreational centers, and the city library. However, an anonymous donation of $300,000 allowed the reopening of the library, one pool, the recreational center, and senior center. Another $20,000 was raised through a resident fundraising drive to help reopen the library. City records show they had budget surpluses in the following years.

=== History of schools ===

Around 1995 Jerry Dittrich, a City Council member in Benbrook, had campaigned for Benbrook leaving Fort Worth ISD on the grounds that the schools serving Benbrook were too far away, with some being over away. Fort Worth ISD, over the following two decades, began building new schools in Benbrook.

Benbrook Middle opened in August 2011. Prior to the opening of Benbrook Middle, students attended Monning Middle School or Leonard Sixth Grade Center and then Leonard Middle School.

Fort Worth ISD used a 2007 bond to pay for a combined middle and high school that opened in August 2014. Westpark Elementary will be converted into a middle school, and then a $15.5 million new elementary school will open next door. The new Westpark Elementary opened in August 2016. The renovated former elementary school is expected to open as a middle school summer of 2017. The combined middle and high school will become solely a high school when the converted middle school opens.

<text>Colleyville is a city in northeastern Tarrant County, Texas, United States, centrally located in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. A wealthy suburb of the Dallas/Fort Worth area, Colleyville was originally a small farm town in the 19th century. The population was 26,057 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Emerging from a number of small, rural settlements along the Cotton Belt Route, Colleyville was originally known as Bransford when Dr. Lilburn Howard Colley settled there in 1880. He was a prominent area physician and a veteran of the Union Army. In 1914, when Walter G. Couch opened a grocery store near Dr. Colley&#x27;s home, the community was renamed Colleyville in his honor.

On January 15, 2022, a hostage crisis occurred at Congregation Beth Israel, a synagogue in Colleyville. Four hostages were held for a number of hours before police shot and killed the perpetrator. The FBI said it was investigating the incident as a &quot;federal hate crime&quot; and an &quot;act of terrorism&quot;. A movie about the event had been made and shown at the docaviv international film festival.

==Geography==

===Politics===
Colleyville, located in the conservative stronghold of northeastern Tarrant County, votes overwhelmingly Republican in all elections, as do most suburban cities in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.

====Tarrant County officials====
====Texas Legislature====

The city almost entirely lies within the boundaries of Texas House District 98 and Texas Senate District 10, with a few houses lying within Texas House District 92 and Texas Senate District 9.

==Education==
Grapevine-Colleyville Independent School District serves most of the city. The district operates eleven elementary schools (pre-kindergarten through 5th grade), four middle schools (6th–8th grades), and two high schools (9th–12th grades). Colleyville Heritage High School and Grapevine High School both draw students from different areas of Colleyville.

Northwestern Colleyville lies inside Keller Independent School District, which maintains one campus within the city. Birdville Independent School District, Carroll Independent School District, and Hurst-Euless-Bedford Independent School District also serve small portions of Colleyville.

Colleyville Covenant Christian Academy is a private religious school serving pre-kindergarten through 12th grade and is a fully accredited member of the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools.

==Transportation==
===Roads and highways===
Two Texas state highways run through city limits. Texas State Highway 121 runs along a portion of the eastern edge of Colleyville, while Texas State Highway 26, also known as Colleyville Boulevard or Grapevine Highway, bisects the city, running southwest to northeast. The speed limit on every road in the city is 30 mph, excluding the 45 mph speed limit on Highway 26 set by TxDOT.

===Rail===
The Grapevine Vintage Railroad runs through the city along the former Cotton Belt Route right-of-way, offering rides on vintage locomotives from downtown Grapevine to downtown Fort Worth. Commuter rail service began on January 10, 2019, with the introduction of TEXRail, offering service from Fort Worth to DFW Airport through Northeast Tarrant County. Due to immense opposition from the Colleyville City Council and residents, the commuter train does not stop in Colleyville, so the closest stations are the North Richland Hills/Smithfield station to the west and the Grapevine station to the east.

===Airports===
Two major airports serve passengers in the Metroplex. Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, one of the busiest airports in the world, provides airline services to over 200 destinations. American Airlines, headquartered nearby in Fort Worth, maintains its largest hub at DFW. Colleyville has experienced significant population growth because of its proximity to the airport. Dallas Love Field, in Northwest Dallas, is home to the headquarters of Southwest Airlines and serves as a focus city for the airline.

===Trails===
The Cotton Belt Trail is an eleven-mile bicyclist and pedestrian trail that lies parallel to the former Cotton Belt Route railroad through Grapevine, Colleyville, Hurst, and North Richland Hills, with 3.4 miles running through Colleyville. The Colleyville Nature Center also provides a 1.25 mile hiking trail.

<text>Dalworthington Gardens is a city in Tarrant County, Texas, United States and a suburb of Arlington.

==History==
The community was established in 1934 as a subsistence homestead project during the Great Depression under the authority of the National Industrial Recovery Act as part of the Subsistence Homesteads Division. The purpose of the homestead program was to help families attain a better standard of living through a combination of part-time industrial employment and subsistence agriculture. Dalworthington Gardens was one of five such projects located in Texas. Its inclusion in the group was at the suggestion of Eleanor Roosevelt, who happened upon the area while visiting the Fort Worth family of the woman to whom the son of her and President Roosevelt, Elliot, had become engaged. Of the five sites selected for this program, Dalworthington &quot;colony&quot; as it was originally called, is the only one still in existence today. Since it has been in constant operation from its inception, it maintains its original zoning regulations, which allow subsistence farming and livestock on any lots over one-half acre that remain owned and occupied from the time the zoning was first put into effect. Thus, one can see small, older frame homes with livestock on their lot, near and even adjacent to large modern homes with values in excess of $1 million. The community&#x27;s name is a portmanteau of the names of the three anchor cities of the metroplex: Dallas, Fort Worth, and Arlington.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 1.95%, is covered by water.

The town&#x27;s northern border adjoins Pantego; both towns are completely surrounded by the city of Arlington.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, 2,293 people, 789 households, and 657 families resided in the city. Its population was 2,259 at the 2010 census.

==Politics==

Dalworthington Gardens is a largely Republican jurisdiction in modern times, having supported the GOP in the last six presidential elections, and the last seven Texas gubernatorial elections.

== Education ==

===Public education===
Dalworthington Gardens lies within the Arlington Independent School District. Dalworthington Gardens is served by Key Elementary School, Gunn Junior High School, Martin High School, and Arlington High School.

In Texas, school district boundaries do not always follow city and county boundaries because all aspects of the school district government apparatus, including school district boundaries, are independent from the city and county government. In the case of Dalworthington Gardens, no independent school district was ever established. The proximity of the already established Arlington ISD led to the entirety of Dalworthington Gardens being served by the AISD since the middle of the 20th century.

===Colleges and universities===
No colleges or universities are located in this community, but the town lies in proximity to the University of Texas at Arlington. The community is also served by the Tarrant County College district of junior colleges, which has campuses located in some surrounding cities.

<text>Everman is a city in Tarrant County, Texas, United States. Its population was 6,154 in the 2020 census, an increase over the figure of 6,108 tabulated in 2010.

==History==

Everman is an incorporated residential community on the southern edge of Fort Worth near Interstate 820 in southeastern Tarrant County. Members of the Kiowa, Apache, and Wichita tribes inhabited the area until the arrival of Anglo-Americans in the early to middle 1850s. A hamlet named Oak Grove existed in the area for several years. A small community to the east of present-day Everman was known as Enon. The &quot;Enon&quot; community name had been taken from the Bible. They had a doctor&#x27;s office, a drug store, and a general store.

Upon the arrival of the International – Great Northern Railroad in 1902, the more established community of Everman Village was developed. The town moved closer to the railway, which was convenient because it gave the citizens transportation and a means to ship freight both to Houston and to Fort Worth, the nearest city. It was much easier and more pleasant to ride the train than to ride a horse, buggy, or wagon. The people named this new community Everman after John Wesley Everman, the man who was the head of the surveying party that platted the town site. A native of Philadelphia, he came to Texas as an engineer for the IGN Railroad and eventually became the general superintendent and assistant general manager for the Texas and Pacific Railway Company. He died in Dallas in 1946 at the age of 85. The names of some of his descendants still appear in the Fort Worth telephone book, though none live in the city of Everman. The original streets were named after the men who were in that survey party: Noble, Trammell, Trice, Parker, and Hansbarger. Enon Street was named after the first settlement. After the railroad was established, the town put up a cotton gin and started a land office business.

In 1905, postal service to the settlement began, and in 1906, Everman established an independent school district. In 1917, the community was one of three sites selected to serve as a flight-training school for the Canadian Royal Flying Corps and the United States Signal Corps, Aviation Section. Barron Field, just outside the city, stimulated the local economy and increased population growth. In 1976, the Everman Garden Club obtained a Texas Historical Marker for the Barron Munitions Building, which after the war had served as a schoolhouse for African-American schoolchildren.

By the mid-1920s Everman had eight businesses and an estimated population of 138. In 1924, a fire destroyed the bank, a lodge hall that was over the bank, and a grocery store.

An election was held on July 7, 1945, launching the City of Everman. On August 25, 1945, a mayor, a marshal, and five aldermen were elected. W. A. Wilson was the first mayor of Everman, and the first marshal was Buster Stephenson. The five aldermen were W. B. Dwiggins, Jack Neill, Clyde Pittman, Howard Easter and J. W. Bishop. Everman was on her way to becoming a city, but water was needed. Bonds were sold to build a public water supply system, and a volunteer fire department was organized. The city&#x27;s water was first furnished by Claude Vaughan&#x27;s well.

In 1948, the name changed from the Village of Everman to the City of Everman. In 1966, another big fire struck in Everman. This time, the town lost the post office, a drug store, and a cafe. The businesses rebuilt in another location. After the nearby Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport was constructed, the number of residents in Everman increased to more than 5,000 by the mid-1970s. Everman adopted the council-manager form of city government in 1986.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.69%, is covered by water.

==Demographics==


As of the 2020 United States census, 6,154 people, 2,126 households, and 1,396 families resided in the city.

==Education==

The city of Everman is served by the Everman Independent School District, with five elementary schools (kindergarten-grade 4), two intermediate schools (grades 5–6), one junior high school, and two high schools. Everman Joe C. Bean High School is home to the 2001 and 2002 Texas 3A state football champions and the Texas 3A state boys&#x27; basketball champions.

In 1912 citizens drilled a &quot;crooked hole well,&quot; the first private water system in the community. By 1925 the community had 25 residents and two businesses. Forest Hill gained a new source of water in the early 1940s. By 1944 Trentman Company and the Johnson Campbell Company began building homes. The owners of the private water system sold it to Texas Water Company.

The community incorporated as a village on March 16, 1946. In the late 1940s the village had around 90 people. In 1949 the village petitioned to be relabeled as a city after reaching 500 citizens; on April 8 of that year the village was relabeled as a city. By 1954 the volunteer fire department, the court, and the corporation court opened. The city had 1,519 people in the mid-1950s.

The city expanded in the 1960s. In 1967 the city had 3,800 people; the city grew due to its proximity to Fort Worth. By the early 1970s the city adopted the Forest Hill Home Rule Charter in order to more easily annex territory and to allow for better governance. The city had 10,250 people in 1976 and 11,482 in 1990. In the 1970s, it elected its first female mayor, Jackie Larson.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 13,955 people, 3,754 households, and 2,944 families residing in the city.

Two primary schools, Harlean Beal Elementary School and David K. Sellars Elementary School, serve separate areas within the FWISD section of Forest Hill. The FWISD secondary schools that serve the section of Forest Hill, located in Fort Worth, include Glencrest 6th Grade School, Forest Oak Middle School, and O. D. Wyatt High School.

<doc id="136645" wikidata="Q26485" url="?curid=136645" title="Keller, Texas">
<text>Keller is a city in Tarrant County, Texas, United States, in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. According to the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population is 45,776, making Keller the 78th most populated city in Texas. The most recent population estimate, as of July 1, 2021, is 45,397.

In the early 1850s, settlers established Keller and the town became a stop on the Texas and Pacific Railway. The settlers settled around the wooded region in Keller because of Keller&#x27;s proximity to the Trinity River water supply and abundant farmland. On November 16, 1955, Keller became incorporated.

Keller is mostly residential, featuring more than of developed land for 11 park sites and more than 26 miles of hiking and biking trails.

== History ==

=== Before establishment ===

Keller is in the western fringe of the Eastern Cross Timbers in northeast Tarrant County, part of the frontier of the Peters Colony settlers of the 1840s. In the mid-1840s, the area was first settled by a group of families from Missouri that homesteaded near the head-waters of Big Bear Creek. Mount Gilead Baptist Church was established on July 13, 1850. In 1859, the little log church was burned in an Indian raid. It served as the only schoolhouse in that part of the county until about 1910.

The area became known as &#x27;Double Springs&#x27; for the two large springs approximately mile north of Mt. Gilead Baptist Church. In the early 1870s, the Double Springs area had a cotton gin, a grist mill, a blacksmith shop and several stores. In 1896, an artesian well was drilled in Keller; the Double Springs filled with silt over time and eventually were plugged and lost until rediscovery in 1984. Today Samantha Springs produces more than 200,000 gallons of water per day.

=== Establishment of Keller ===
The Texas and Pacific Railway between Fort Worth and Texarkana was completed in June 1881, and the first train ran on this track on May 9, 1881, which ran parallel with parts of the old Chisholm cattle drive trail. With the advent of rail service, new villages were established all along the line. The Keller of today was one of them. On July 19, 1881, H.W. Black, a druggist of Tarrant County, set aside out of the north end of the deeded to him by A.C. Roberts (being a part of the Samuel Needham Survey) for a town site to be known as Athol, situated northeast of Fort Worth. The land was dedicated to the public for streets and alleyways, but title to the remainder of the was held by Mr. Black. Settlers migrated to the new village, and before a year had passed the name of the town was changed from Athol to Keller, honoring John C. Keller, a foreman on the railroad. Streets were named and those in the original site still carry the names given to them in 1881. Streets going north and south are Lamar, Main and Elm; those running east and west are Price, Taylor, Hill, Vine, Bates, Olive and Pecan.

===Modern Keller===
New residential development is gradually filling in open spaces, with neighboring towns affording no opportunity to expand its boundaries. The 1980 Census calculated Keller&#x27;s population at 4,555; today, nearly 45,000 residents call Keller home. City facilities include Keller Town Hall on Bear Creek Parkway, the Keller Public Library and Keller Senior Activities Center on Johnson Road, the Municipal Service Center on Bear Creek Pkwy. West, and the city&#x27;s recreation and aquatic center known as The Keller Pointe on Rufe Snow Drive. The city also recently renovated and expanded its police facility, which houses the Regional Jail, Regional Animal Adoption Center and regional 911 dispatch center, NETCOM, serving the cities of Keller, Colleyville, Southlake and Westlake.

<doc id="136647" wikidata="Q697954" url="?curid=136647" title="Atari Teenage Riot">
<text>Atari Teenage Riot (ATR) is a German band formed in Berlin in 1992. Highly political, they fuse anarchist and anti-fascist views with punk vocals and a techno sound called digital hardcore, which is a term band member Alec Empire used as the name of his record label Digital Hardcore Recordings.

==History==
Atari Teenage Riot was founded as an attack on the Neo-Nazi subculture by fusing hardcore punk views with German techno; it consisted of three Berliners—Alec Empire, Hanin Elias and MC Carl Crack. ATR&#x27;s early releases (which included the track &quot;Hetzjagd Auf Nazis!&quot;/&quot;Hunt Down the Nazis!&quot;) were surrounded by controversy in Germany.

After signing to major European label Phonogram Records in 1993, the band received a large financial advance which they duplicitously used to set up their own record label: Digital Hardcore Recordings (DHR). ATR never delivered a commercially viable demo to Phonogram.

The major label Intercord signed the group in 1995 for Germany. ATR&#x27;s record label Digital Hardcore Recordings released the debut album &quot;Delete Yourself!&quot; internationally. In 1996 the Beastie Boys licensed the album and released it in the US with extra songs under the title &quot;Burn Berlin Burn&quot; on their label Grand Royal.

The band toured in 1997 with Wu-Tang Clan, Rage Against the Machine, Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, Moby and Beck because of the success of their album Burn Berlin Burn. 

In 1996, ATR was joined by Nic Endo, a noise/soundscape artist, who played her first live show with ATR in the spring of 1997 during the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas.

In 1999, ATR released the album &quot;60 Second Wipe Out&quot;, which featured a number of guest artists, including rappers The Arsonists. According to &quot;Magnet&quot;, &quot;Empire&#x27;s guitar-playing values speed-thrash malevolence, and when paired with Endo&#x27;s painful skronkage, the album is decidedly denser than its predecessor&quot;.

That year the band were arrested in Berlin for &quot;inciting violence&quot; during a performance at a protest against the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Conflicts began between the 30,000-strong crowd of protestors and police while the band played their song &quot;Revolution Action.&quot;

Elias left ATR at the Brixton Academy show in the winter of 1999. The plan had been to tour with Nine Inch Nails in the US during the spring of 2000, but ATR decided to cancel the show to recharge. Crack also needed time to recuperate from his psychosis attacks.

In the autumn of 2000, ATR started working on their fourth album. The song &quot;Rage&quot;, featuring Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine, was chosen as an in-between single until the release of the fourth album. &quot;Rage&quot; was part of the recording sessions for &quot;60 Second Wipe Out&quot;, but Empire did not feel it would fit the album.

On 6 September 2001, Crack, who had long struggled with psychiatric issues, died from an overdose of unspecified pills. The media hype surrounding Crack&#x27;s death is disputed by ATR. According to a friend, a few weeks before his death he had spoken about a doctor&#x27;s report which said his psychosis attacks would worsen with age. According to that friend, Crack said he would rather kill himself than become a &quot;zombie&quot; and not be in control of his life. Witnesses have said Crack tried to reach out to his friends because he felt the psychosis starting again. When his body was found by police with large quantities of medication in his stomach, this suggested suicide. It is still unclear if this happened while he was in a state of psychosis or not (while in a psychotic state, it could be interpreted as an accident rather than suicide).

The other half of the band continue to work together. Endo assisted in the production of Empire&#x27;s solo recordings, as well as being a key member of his live band. DHR released &quot;Atari Teenage Riot: 1992–2000&quot;, a collection of the band&#x27;s best known recordings, on 3 July 2006.

===Reformation===

In October 2009, Elias contacted Empire to play some concerts together, but had to refrain because of her voice. When it became clear that Elias would not show up to the first show, the band published a statement 30 minutes before show time.

In January 2010, it was announced ATR would reunite for a few live shows in Europe. Later in the year, they announced additional shows in Europe, North America and Asia. In early March 2010, Empire released the new ATR track &quot;Activate&quot; via SoundCloud, which is the first song featuring their new MC, CX KiDTRONiK. &quot;Activate&quot; was recorded on 3 March 2010 in Berlin at the Hellish Vortex Studios. Female vocals were provided by Endo.

The band played most major festivals throughout Europe in 2010, including Reading and Leeds, and headlined the Fusion Festival in front of approximately 20,000 people. In the same year, ATR headlined a stage at Japan&#x27;s Summersonic Festival, returning the following year to play at Fuji Rock Festival. The band had the headline slot on the electronic stage at the Berlin Festival, which is held at an old military airport in the centre of the city. Enthused, the band decided to add more dates. The live line-up of ATR, , consisted of Empire, Endo and CX KiDTRONiK.

On 12 October 2010, Steve Aoki and Dim Mak Records announced the release of Atari Teenage Riot&#x27;s new single &quot;Activate&quot;, with the full-length album &quot;Is This Hyperreal?&quot; released in 2011. While the record was described as &quot;redundant&quot; by Pitchfork Media, in what Empire called &quot;probably one of the dumbest reviews I&#x27;ve ever read about any record.&quot;, other magazines gave it great reviews. &quot;New Musical Express&quot; wrote: &quot;Few bands have ever detonated as powerfully in the underground as Atari Teenage Riot. Put simply, they were the conscience of electronic music. They were a band that sounded the way you always wanted The Prodigy to sound. A band akin to Black Flag if that outfit had existed in an age where every home had a computer. And their influence burned big and bright&quot;. Artrocker Magazine put them on the cover in their May 2011 issue and wrote: &quot;Make no mistake, &#x27;Activate&#x27; is the most exhilarating, futuristic and punk rock single of the month. (...) ATR aren&#x27;t like any other band. They&#x27;re the only group that could have cut a record with Rage Against the Machine and have it be their meekest recording. They&#x27;re the only group that iTunes have censored on the grounds that their music could create riots! Ten years and several line-up changes makes no difference to tonight&#x27;s immediate onslaught of rave, punk, screaming and pounding gabba. The finale consists of the fiercest white noise squall of the evening, and the audience&#x27;s reaction (moshing, screaming, crowdsurfing, shoes flying through the air) seems to indicate they don&#x27;t care either&quot;. That month the band headlined the Bang Face Weekender festival in the UK.

Their album &quot;Is This Hyperreal?&quot; was celebrated as &quot;the ultimate protest album of the google age,&quot; dealing with WikiLeaks, Anonymous, hackers, the freedom the internet brought to the suppressed, censorship, the surveillance state, cyber terrorism and digital decay, a term which describes the disaffected masses abandoning the internet when they realised that it was not free but infested with government controls. The campaign for &quot;Is This Hyperreal?&quot; took a turn when the &quot;Black Flags&quot; viral video was taken up by Anonymous whose members and supporters sent in clips from the Occupy Wall Street protests last autumn. Remixes, mash ups and alternate versions created by fans to represent their own dissatisfaction proliferated and captured the mood so accurately it was played in a CNN broadcast to summarise the zeitgeist behind Anonymous&#x27; cyber attacks. Dangerous Minds were calling it the first anthem of the Occupy movement: &quot;While personally I would have thought it would be a new act to break through representing a new generation, no-one can doubt ATR’s credentials when it comes to this kind of thing. In fact, maybe in this age of ultra-commodified music it would HAVE to take a more veteran, established act to represent OWS and Anonymous so as to avoid claims of false appropriation? You have to hand it to ATR though; &quot;Black Flags&quot; is a pretty great tune. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s one of their most accessible yet while retaining all that dark techno-punk scuzzy energy we know and love.&quot;

In Spring 2012 the music video for &quot;Black Flags&quot; was nominated for the MTV O Music Awards in the US in the category &quot;Best Protest Song of the Year&quot;.

In advance of a December 2016 concert in Tel Aviv, Israel, ATR used Facebook to declare their opposition to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, calling it &quot;a support mechanism for Palestinian terrorist groups in their efforts to de-legitimize and ultimately destroy Israel&quot;, accusing Seeds of Peace of promoting &quot;anti-Israel activities&quot;, and proposing that &quot;working together is the best way to create a better future.&quot;

<text>Bad Doberan () is a former district in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. It was named after its largest town, Bad Doberan, the German &quot;Bad&quot; meaning &quot;spa&quot;. The district surrounded the City of Rostock, bordering the Baltic Sea in the north as well as the former original districts of Nordvorpommern, Güstrow and Nordwestmecklenburg. The district was disbanded at the district reform of September 2011. Its territory has been part of the district of Rostock since.

== History ==
Before 500 AD East Germanic tribes dominated the area, who later on emigrated to the West. The then very rural region was thereafter scarcely populated by Slavic peoples until the 12th century. Remains of a Slavic castle can be found in the town of Rerik (which still bears a Slavic name). In 1160 Henry the Lion conquered the region; afterwards German monks, peasants and traders arrived to settle here. In the Middle Ages the region profited from the vicinity of the wealthy Hanseatic city of Rostock. The worst time in regional history was the Thirty Years&#x27; War, which depopulated the area almost completely.

In 1793 the bathing resort of Heiligendamm (today a borough of Bad Doberan) was established, and the region became a summer residence for the dukes of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.

In 1952 the districts of Bad Doberan and Rostock-Land were established. They were merged in 1994 to form the enlarged district of Bad Doberan. This district was merged with the district of Güstrow at the district reform of September 2011, forming the new district of Rostock.

== Geography ==
The district comprised a 62 km coastline along the Baltic Sea and its hinterland on both banks of the Warnow River. The Warnow enters the district in the south and leaves for the city of Rostock. Rostock was surrounded by the district, but not part of it.

== Coat of arms ==
== Towns and municipalities ==
The subdivisions of the district were (situation August 2011):

<text>North Richland Hills, commonly known as NRH, is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, located in Tarrant County. It is a mid-to-high end suburb of Fort Worth and forms part of the Mid-Cities region of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. The population was 69,917 at the 2020 census, making it the third largest city in Tarrant County. In 2006, North Richland Hills was selected as one of the &quot;Top 100 Best Places to live in America&quot; according to &quot;Money&quot; magazine, and in 2016, the Dallas Morning News ranked North Richland Hills #9 on its list of best Dallas–Fort Worth neighborhoods.

==History==
The community began when W.S. Peters agreed to bring 600 families into the area within a three-year period as part of a land grant. Families began arriving in the summer of 1848. In 1849, Tarrant County was established and named for General Edward H. Tarrant. The community of Birdville (adjacent to what is now the southwest boundary of North Richland Hills) was named the first county seat. The area remained a rural farming and ranching community for more than 100 years.

In 1952, Clarence Jones began to subdivide his dairy farm into a suburban addition in the area that is now Cummings Drive. In 1953, the North Richland Hills Civic League sought to have the area annexed to Richland Hills, then voted to form their own city when annexation was denied. An election was held, and the of the Jones Farm, with a population of 500, became officially incorporated as the City of North Richland Hills.

The first section of streets in North Richland Hills was named for the local families. The second section, which was added in 1954, was named for automobiles. There were 188 homes in the first part of the subdivision, which was restricted to brick and masonry construction.

By 1957, the North Richland Hills&#x27; boundary was within of Smithfield, and by 1960, Smithfield had been annexed into North Richland Hills. In 1960, the population of North Richland Hills was beginning to rise at 8,662 residents, with that number more than doubling to 16,514 by 1970. The city&#x27;s population continued to grow at a rapid pace, with the 1980 census at 30,592, and the 1990 census reflecting 45,895.

<text>Pantego is a town in Tarrant County, Texas, United States. Its population was 2,568 at the 2020 census. It is entirely surrounded by the cities of Arlington and Dalworthington Gardens. It is in the middle of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, a metropolitan area spanning several counties.

==History==

The earliest Europeans in the area are thought to be the members of the De Soto expedition under Luis de Moscoso, in 1542. The expedition is thought to have camped near what is now Village Creek. European settlement in the Pantego area dates back at least to the 1840s. After the May 24, 1841, battle between Texas General Edward H. Tarrant and Native Americans of the Village Creek settlement, a trading post was established at Marrow Bone Spring in present-day Arlington. The rich soil of the area attracted farmers, and several agriculture-related businesses were well established by the late 19th century.

Settler and state representative Frederick Forney Foscue acquired the land that is now Pantego after the Civil War. He bought land, sold and rented it to other settlers in the area, and can be considered the first land developer of Pantego. According to local tradition, Colonel Foscue had a Native American friend named Pantego. In 1883, Colonel Foscue donated land for a school. Tradition holds the school was named Pantego in honor of Colonel Foscue&#x27;s friend. The town took form shortly after and took the name Pantego, reflected now in the feathered Town of Pantego logo.

Originally incorporated in 1949, the town dissolved in February 1952 and reincorporated on May 22, 1952.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.0 square mile (2.6 km2), all land.

The town&#x27;s southern border adjoins Dalworthington Gardens; both towns are completely surrounded by the city of Arlington.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, 2,568 people, 1,064 households, and 672 families were residing in the town.

== Education ==
No colleges or universities are present in this small community, but the town lies within driving distance to Arlington and the rest of the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area, which contains a number of colleges and universities, including the University of Texas at Arlington, the Southeast Campus of the Tarrant County College system, and Arlington Baptist University.

Pantego lies within the Arlington Independent School District. Pantego is zoned to Hill Elementary School, Bailey Junior High School, and Arlington High School.

In Texas, school district boundaries do not always follow city and county boundaries because all aspects of the school district government apparatus, including school district boundaries, are separated from the city and county government. In the case of Pantego, no independent school district (ISD) was ever established. The proximity of the already established Arlington ISD led to the entirety of Pantego being served by the AISD since the middle of the 20th century.

Pantego Christian Academy has facilities within the city limits of Pantego and Arlington. Around 2008, the school bought a building at 2221 West Park Row Drive to use as a high school campus.
==Law and government==

Pantego is a general law city. It has a city council consisting of five members elected at large for staggered two-year terms and a mayor elected for a two-year term.

Pantego has a council-manager form of government. It has full-time police and fire departments and several citizen committees.

Residents can obtain a library card from Arlington&#x27;s library system. 

The United States Postal Service operates the Pantego Post Office in Arlington.

<text>Hanin Elias (born 31 May 1972) is a Syrian German industrial/techno artist. She was a member of Atari Teenage Riot and is now a solo artist.

After Atari Teenage Riot&#x27;s non-definitive break in 2000, and the subsequent death of Carl Crack from a drug overdose, the members of ATR split up, and Elias set up her own record label, Fatal Recordings.

==Background==
Elias was born in Wittlich, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany and spent three years of her early life living in Syria. A member of a conservative family living under an autocratic father, when the family moved to Berlin she ran away from home and started squatting in the city. Elias started participating in the Berlin punk and goth scenes, developing a musical career and ended up helping to found Atari Teenage Riot.

== Atari Teenage Riot ==
After a brief, unhappy spell with the Phonogram record company, ATR set up their own label, Digital Hardcore Recordings, which became known for its distinctive sound – a hybrid of punk, techno, and heavy metal, also known as Digital Hardcore.

== Fatal record company ==
After the members of ATR split, Elias&#x27; DHR spin-off company, &#x27;Fatal&#x27;, went independent, establishing itself in Berlin instead of London. Elias has since released several albums, and her Fatal label has boasted such artists as The Vanishing, Phallus Über Alles, Kunst and Tara Delong. Elias has also performed duets and remixes with such artists as Le Tigre, Thurston Moore, J Mascis, Alexander Hacke, Merzbow, and Alec Empire. In 2005, Elias began working with the industrial project Pigface, joining them on their US tour.

In 2006, it was announced that Fatal Recordings was to close. Elias announced on her MySpace blog that she would be taking an indefinite hiatus from the music industry and relocating to French Polynesia with her family. In 2010, Hanin moved back to Berlin/Germany in order to prepare a new album for 2011.

==New album and comeback==
In June 2011, the new album &quot;Get It Back&quot; on Rustblade Recordings was released. In February 2014, Hanin Elias released an album under the name of &#x27;Fantome&#x27;, with her co-musician Marcel Zürcher who plays guitar and writes songs for Die Krupps. The album was titled &quot;It All Makes Sense&quot;.

In 2016, her collaboration with the French producer Electrosexual marks the release of the single &quot;Hold Me&quot; and &quot;Automatic People&quot;.

<doc id="136665" wikidata="Q969613" url="?curid=136665" title="White Settlement, Texas">
<text>White Settlement is a city in Tarrant County, Texas, United States, and a northwestern suburb of Fort Worth. The population was estimated to be 18,084 in 2021. The city is bordered by Lockheed Martin and the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth.

White Settlement Public Library is home to Browser who gained international attention in 2016 when local politicians sought to oust him from the library over the objections of local residents.

==History==
Even before the beginnings of a nearby military outpost, Fort Worth, white settlers took up refuge along a creek, later named Farmers Branch Creek. Before the end of 1841, settlers began arriving from Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee. In 1850 the area&#x27;s first census showed the population consisted of 599 white Americans and 65 Black enslaved people. By the mid-1850s, many more settlers arrived bringing with them more slaves.

The oldest street in White Settlement is White Settlement Road. This original trail led from the fort to the &quot;white settlement&quot; about eight miles west into Native American territory. As the Native Americans were forced from the area, and the settlement moved westward, the road followed. This was the only public road in White Settlement&#x27;s early history.

While early life was not easy for the settlers with frequent clashes with indigenous populations, White Settlement became a trading outpost. As the migrating settlers carved out homesteads among the various indigenous tribes, outsiders and Native Americans referred to the area as &quot;the white settlement.&quot;

In February 1942, Consolidated Aircraft Company began construction on the B-24 Liberator heavy bomber at Air Force Plant #4. Liberator Village, as it became known, consisted of housing units across the city to house aircraft workers.

In modern times, the city of White Settlement is the gateway to national defense, bordered by Lockheed Martin and the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth. As federal properties, the White Settlement Police Department has concurrent jurisdiction for calls for service and patrols at the military base and aircraft plant.

Two members of the city&#x27;s West Freeway Church of Christ were killed by a gunman on December 29, 2019, during a morning service. The shooter was in turn shot dead by a church security guard.

Most recent White Settlement Mayor Ronald White died in office on January 17, 2023. Mayor White was the 19th Mayor of White Settlement. Mayor Pro Tem Amber Muñoz took over as the 20th Mayor of White Settlement, becoming the first female Mayor in White Settlement. On May 6, 2023, citizens of White Settlement elected Faron Young in a special election to fill the office for the remainder of White&#x27;s term.

==Name==
The city got its name as it was a lone settlement of white colonists amid several Native American villages in the Fort Worth area in the Texas Republic territory in the 1840s.

On October 14, 2005, city leaders, citing hurdles in attracting businesses, announced a plan to have local voters decide on a possible name change for the town from White Settlement to West Settlement. In the November 8 election, the name change was overwhelmingly rejected by a vote of 2,388 to 219.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 6,290 households, and 4,010 families residing in the city.

The city boasts amenities including a city-owned water park, Splash Days, that operates during the summer months. White Settlement Public Library is home to Browser who gained international attention in 2016 when local politicians sought to oust him from the library over the objections of local residents.

White Settlement is also the winter home of several groups of Irish Travellers.

The Texas Civil War Museum was located in White Settlement.

===Religion===
The majority of White Settlement residents identify as Protestant Christians; however, there is also a Mormon church as well as a Buddhist temple within the city limits.

==Government and infrastructure==
The city of White Settlement operates as a city manager form of government overseen by a Mayor and City Council. The suburb of Fort Worth boasts a full-time police and fire department to represent public safety.
The police department is overseen by Chief of Police Christopher Cook, previously the chief spokesperson and deputy police chief for the City of Arlington, Texas. The police department provides dispatch services to the cities of Westworth Village and Sansom Park. The department also provides detention services for the cities of Westover Hills, Westworth Village, Sansom Park, White Settlement Independent School District, the United States Marshal&#x27;s Service, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 2022, the Fort Worth Police Department and Tarrant County Justice of the Precinct 4 Judge Christopher Gregory entered into an Inter-local Agreement with the White Settlement Police Department to establish and authorize concurrent enforcement jurisdiction.

The Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth and Air Force Plant #4 has territory in White Settlement. The United States Postal Service operates the White Settlement Post Office. The city is under the jurisdiction of Tarrant County and operates as a Council-Manager government type.

<text>Buffalo Gap is a town in Taylor County, Texas, United States. It is part of the Abilene, Texas Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 543 at the 2020 census. 

==History==
Buffalo Gap’s roots trace back to the early 1870s, when Buffalo Soldiers arrived to hunt the buffalo herds migrating from Montana into Texas. The natural gap in the Callahan Divide provided an ideal passage for these herds, giving the town its name and early identity.

According to some sources, Buffalo Gap was founded in 1875—a date proudly displayed on the City Hall reader board. By 1877, the town had grown enough to establish its own post office, with the population reaching 400 by the following year. The town’s significance was further recognized when Governor Richard Hubbard declared Buffalo Gap the official county seat of Taylor County on July 3, 1878.

As Buffalo Gap developed, new businesses and institutions emerged, including the construction of a courthouse, hotel, blacksmith shop, general store, newspaper, saloons, stables, and banks. In 1885, Buffalo Gap College opened, marking the town as a thriving center of education and commerce.

However, in 1895, the arrival of the Santa Fe railroad brought a significant shift. The railroad bypassed Buffalo Gap in favor of the flatter terrain in Abilene, leading to a change in growth and prosperity. While Abilene rapidly expanded, Buffalo Gap’s growth slowed. Despite this, the town’s residents remained deeply connected to their community.

In the 1920s, the Old Settlers Picnic was established, becoming a cherished tradition that is still celebrated today at the Old Settlers Grounds—a site used for community events and the town’s monthly flea market.
In 1956, local resident Ernie Wilson purchased the original Taylor County Courthouse and founded the Museum of the Old West, now known as the Buffalo Gap Historic Village. This historical gem preserves the legacy of Buffalo Gap, offering visitors a glimpse into the life and times of the Old West.

In the 1980s, Buffalo Gap made history with its unique Volunteer Fire Department, composed almost entirely of women, with the exception of Fire Chief and Mayor Glenn Johnson. This all-female department exemplified the town’s spirit, dedication, and community involvement.

The town was noted in the 1960s and 1970s for its restaurants and the fact that it was one of two &quot;wet&quot; spots in Taylor County where alcoholic beverages could be sold. Deutschlander Freshwater Catfish Company and the Bar B Q Barn still operate today.

The Shades of Hope Treatment Center in Buffalo Gap specializes in the treatment of eating disorders, and has been featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show.

<doc id="136667" wikidata="Q977252" url="?curid=136667" title="Impact, Texas">
<text>Impact is a town in Taylor County, Texas, United States. The population was 22 as of the 2020 census, down from 35 at the 2010 census, making it the second least populated municipality in Texas. It is part of the Abilene, Texas Metropolitan Statistical Area and is an enclave of the city of Abilene.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==History==
The area that became known as Impact began as a poultry farm owned by advertising businessman Dallas Perkins. Prior to 1960, liquor sales were prohibited in all cities and counties surrounding Abilene. The prohibition of legal liquor sales encouraged bootleggers to produce illegal liquor commonly called &quot;moonshine&quot;.

Perkins capitalized on the potential market for legal liquor among the wets by purchasing 27 acres of land adjacent to his farm on the outskirts of Abilene and then pushing for its incorporation. Calling the village &quot;Impact&quot; after his advertising business, 29 signatures of local residents were collected and it was incorporated in 1960.

Soon after, the village&#x27;s citizens voted 18 to 2 to permit liquor sales. Abilene lawyers immediately filed motions to oppose the town&#x27;s incorporation, but a Texas Supreme Court ruling in 1963 upheld Impact&#x27;s incorporation and its right to sell liquor.

Two liquor stores opened in Impact in 1963. The first month&#x27;s sales were $463,000 (equivalent to roughly $3.5 million in 2012). With the newfound revenues, the village&#x27;s roads were paved and lighted, garbage pickup was introduced, and a policeman was hired. One of the liquor stores was Pinky&#x27;s, which was owned by Perkins and his associates and used a logo of a pink elephant, thus the name.

Impact remained the only wholly wet municipality in Taylor County until 1978, when Abilene voters narrowly legalized (by a 131-vote margin) liquor sales in the city. With that vote, Impact lost its reason for being. The liquor stores in Impact soon dried up and closed and the community became just another suburb of Abilene.

Impact has been and still is one of the smallest incorporated communities in Texas. Its population peaked at 61 in 1970 and had declined to 39 by 2000.

<text>Potosi is a census-designated place (CDP) in Taylor County, Texas, United States. Its population was 2,991 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Abilene, Texas metropolitan statistical area.

==Geography==
Potosi is located along FM 1750, approximately nine miles south of Abilene in east-central Taylor County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 18.5 sq mi (47.8 km2), all land.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Potosi has a humid subtropical climate, &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps, typically characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. Potosi also borders the neighboring semiarid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot; or &quot;BSk&quot;) of the west-central Texas region, which has characteristically long, hot summers and short, moderate winters.

==History==
The first settlers in the area were the Pollard family in the 1870s. In 1893, R.A. Pollard applied for a post office and chose the name Potosi after the Mexican city of San Luis Potosí. An estimated 100 inhabitants were living in the community in 1896. By 1940, 80 residents, a school, a church, four businesses, and a number of dwellings were there. In 1949, Potosi&#x27;s school consolidated with the Wylie Independent School District.

The population declined to 20 during the 1950s, and rose to 149 in 1968. Significant growth in the area, aided by its proximity to Abilene, began to occur in the late 1980s, and by 1992, 1,441 people were living in Potosi. That growth has continued to date, as new subdivisions are being constructed and expanded along FM 1750, the main route through Potosi. They include Deerwood, Pack Saddle Prairie, Blackhawk Estates, Pack Saddle Farms, Seven Winds, and Pack Saddle Meadows.

<doc id="136672" wikidata="Q179096" url="?curid=136672" title="Carl Crack">
<text>Carl Crack (born Karl Böhm; 5 May 1971 – 6 September 2001) was a Swazi-born German techno artist best known for his membership in the digital hardcore band Atari Teenage Riot from 1992 to 2000.

==Biography==
Around 1992, Crack displayed little interest in the music scene as it was at the time. He felt that The Beatnigs (the original vehicle for social and political critic Michael Franti, later of the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy and Spearhead) were one of the few significant bands around. Along with the other members of Atari Teenage Riot he was looking for a new direction.

Crack initially had a significant influence on ATR&#x27;s style, particularly on the first two albums where he developed an MC style which owed less to the U.S. than his own imagination. He also had his own musical ideas that could not be expressed within the confines of a group, leading to his only solo release, &quot;Black Ark&quot;, in 1998. It is, as the name suggests, heavily influenced by dub and in particular Lee Perry.

After heavy touring to promote ATR&#x27;s third album, &quot;60 Second Wipe Out&quot;, the members of the group commenced work on follow ups to their various solo projects. Crack appeared on Cobra Killer&#x27;s 2002 album, &quot;The Third Armpit&quot;. He also was part of Firewire and Whatever, both with Din-St.

On 6 September 2001, Crack, who had long struggled with psychiatric issues, died at the age of 30 from an overdose of unspecified pills. The media hype surrounding Crack&#x27;s death is disputed by ATR. According to a friend, a few weeks before his death he had spoken about a doctor&#x27;s report which said his psychosis attacks would worsen with age. According to that friend, Crack said he would rather kill himself than become a &quot;zombie&quot; and not be in control of his life. Witnesses have said Crack tried to reach out to his friends because he felt the psychosis starting again. When his body was found by police with large quantities of medication in his stomach, this suggested suicide. It is still unclear if this happened while he was in a state of psychosis or not (while in a psychotic state, it could be interpreted as an accident rather than suicide).

<text>Sanderson is a census-designated place (CDP) in and the county seat of Terrell County, Texas, United States. The population was 664 at the 2020 census. Sanderson was created in 1882 as a part of neighboring Pecos County. It became the seat of Terrell County in 1905.

==History==
Sanderson was founded in 1882. It was a division point for the Southern Pacific Railroad, where refueling and crew changes on its main transcontinental route took place. Mohair and wool production on surrounding ranches formed a significant part of the economy. The community entered in an economic decline when the operations involving sheep and goats decreased.

A devastating flood in June 1965 killed 26 people and washed away homes and businesses near the usually dry Sanderson Creek. Since then, many flood-control dams have been erected across the arroyos upstream from the town.

An illustrated tour brochure guides visitors past 50 historic sites, including several notable buildings remaining from the town&#x27;s more prosperous era. The 1906 Courthouse was built to designs by Henry Phelps, but the still-graceful building was much modified in 1932, in 1950, and again in 1983. Facing the courthouse square is the little-changed 1931 Art Deco-style Sanderson High School, designed by Ralph W. Cameron, one of San Antonio&#x27;s leading architects of the period. A handsome Deco frieze above the entranceway illustrates TRUTH CULTURE PROGRESS SUCCESS. Nearby is a Classical Revival structure built as a Masonic Lodge, but used for many years now as a private residence.

After regulations changed in 1995, the Southern Pacific ended the practice of changing train crews (and overnighting them) in Sanderson. By 2013, the community had lost most of the businesses it had during its peak, and the population was half of what it had been at its peak.

Two tornadoes struck Sanderson on June 2, 2024, significantly damaging or destroying several homes and injuring 12 people. These tornadoes were rated EF1 and EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita scale.

<text>Brownfield is a city in and the county seat of Terry County, Texas, United States. Its population was 8,936 at the 2020 census. Brownfield is southwest of Lubbock.

==History==
In 1903, town promoters W. G. Hardin and A. F. Small purchased the county&#x27;s central lot, platted the site, and named the town after the Brownfield ranching family. To boost chances of becoming the county seat, they granted a lot to every county voter.

The town&#x27;s early years saw the construction of essential structures, including the courthouse, school, and churches. Hill&#x27;s Hotel became the first business, housing the inaugural post office. On June 28, 1904, Brownfield secured the county seat designation, narrowly defeating Gomez in an election. The Brownfield State Bank opened in 1905, serving multiple counties and parts of eastern New Mexico.

Brownfield was incorporated in 1920. Oil wells became operational in 1941, diversifying the town&#x27;s economic landscape.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Brownfield has an area of , 0.32% of which is covered by water.

Brownfield lies in the center of Terry County, in the southern portion of the South Plains and Llano Estacado. The city rests on a windblown deposit called the Blackwater Draw Formation, which is underlain by a thick layer of caliche, referred to locally as the &quot;caprock&quot;. Beneath the caliche layer lies fluvial deposits called the Ogallala Formation, which contains a portion of the Ogallala Aquifer. The Caprock Escarpment, about 50 miles east, forms a precipitous drop of about and exposes various geologic layers. In early days, climbing the Caprock Escarpment was not easy for horse-drawn covered wagons.

The only terrain variation lies at the south end of the city, where Lost Draw carves a channel that runs across the entire county. Lost Draw formed over 10,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age, when the climate of the area was much wetter. When the vast glaciers of the north retreated, they left numerous dry river channels crisscrossing the Llano Estacado. When settlers during the 1800s ventured across this area, they often went into these channels expecting to find water, but unless significant rains had occurred recently, their search was in vain, with many of the parties becoming &quot;lost&quot;, hence the name, Lost Draw.

The most notable geographic feature of Brownfield is its red soil. The soil creates an almost iridescent red color during sunrise and sunset due to the high iron oxide content.

==Climate==
Brownfield lies in a semiarid temperate zone, where high winds and extreme temperature variations are the norm. The summers reach over for multiple consecutive days. The winters often fall below freezing for extended periods, but snow remains unusual due to very little precipitation forming in the winter.

The most significant time of the year for weather events starts in March and runs through September, when severe thunderstorms form on the Great Plains. Rain, winds, hail, and a few tornadoes are to be expected at this time of year. Late thunderstorms that produce hail are significantly harmful to the local economy, as it destroys the local cotton crop.

==Economy==
Cotton farming is the backbone of Brownfield. Cotton fields stretch for miles, and the harvest season in October has harvesters (locally called cotton strippers), module builders, and module trucks all over the county.

A haze develops over the city as the local cotton gins go to work stripping the cotton from the burr, separating the seeds, and then compressing the cotton into 500-lb bales. The haze is actually fine cotton dust, and sometimes small drifts develop in the street resembling snow mixed with red soil.

Peanut growing has found a toehold on the economy, as have vineyards. In recent years, grape growing has made Terry County a producer of wine grapes used as filler for inexpensive wines. Several wineries are now established in the county, which produce average-to-poor quality wine according to numerous reviews and wine review aggregator websites. Local farmers, ranchers, and landowners began growing grapes here as early as 1950, with a few new wineries near the city due to the repeal of fully dry county status in 2008. Several older and more notable wineries are in the Lubbock area, about 30 miles northeast.

Oil production continues to drop from its previous levels in the 1980s. According to current trends, Terry County and Brownfield will continue to decline significantly in oil production and importance in West Texas.

Wal-Mart chose to not renew their lease on their facility on the eastern edge of town, saying the town was not sufficiently economically viable for them to continue to operate.

==Demographics==
Brownfield and Terry County have one of the highest rates of teen pregnancy in Texas. The teen pregnancy rate is 98.1 out of 1000, more than double the national average.

Brownfield has an extremely high sexually transmitted infection rate of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and most notably syphilis, which is much higher than the state average (7.8 per 100,000).

Only 61.5% of the population holds a high school degree or higher, 8.9% a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, and 2.7% a master&#x27;s degree or higher. About 6.1% of the population was unemployed in 2010.

<doc id="136682" wikidata="Q978471" url="?curid=136682" title="Woodson, Texas">
<text>Woodson is a town in Throckmorton County, Texas. United States. As of 2020, the population was 219.

==History==
The area was initially settled in 1875 by J.O. Wood and Henry McClintick. Wood&#x27;s son, O.J. Wood, played a leading role in the shaping of the community and its economics. Woodson was originally called Jom, when it was established around a cotton gin built so that the ranchers could get cottonseed to feed to cattle. After Jom was established, O.J. Wood deeded lots measuring 100 by 190 ft (30 by 58 m) to anyone who would build a residence there, free of charge. This caused businesses to start popping up, as a post office and Wood and Sons grocery were established. 

Since J.O. Wood and his son built the first schoolhouse in town, the town was decided to be called Wood and Son, to honor the two. Throughout time, it was changed to Woodson, which has become the official name. Woodson eventually became a booming town, with an official start date in 1903. The first highway to Breckenridge was built in 1920.

Wood and his son also reportedly built the First Christian Church, located in the center of town on Highway 183, in the 1900s. When the original schoolhouse grew too small to hold all of Woodson&#x27;s students, the First Christian Church was used as an additional educational space.

Another result of the increase in people was the building of a railroad that came through Woodson. According to &quot;Big Country: People, Events and Places, Volume V&quot;, the line was owned and operated by the Texas and Pacific Railroad. The land for the right-of-way was obtained in three ways; some was bought outright from the owners. If the owners refused to sell, the Texas and Pacific took it by easement. Some landowners gave the land for the right-of-way; for instance, the Dickie family gave land through the East Woods to the company. Local men helped build the roadbed and lay the tracks. Once the train was built, it made one run from Cisco to Throckmorton each day.

Due to the railroad and the oil-field boom, Woodson grew for a long time. The town had three gasoline service stations, two cotton gins, two barber shops, and a lumber yard. 

At one point, Woodson also had a movie theater (next to the Woodson Inn), a Chevrolet dealer, a drugstore, and a feed store, next to which a local physician, Doctor Turner, ran a practice.

Woodson originally received its water from the city lake (south of town, on Highway 183, which is now known as Dickie Lake).

==Demographics==

From 1920 to 1930, Woodson&#x27;s population was at an all-time high, with a count of 2,800 people. Due to surrounding areas growing, Woodson has since decreased in size. In 1948, the population was down to about 500 people.

As of the census of 2010, 264 people lived in the town, a decrease of 10.81% since 2000 (32 people). The racial makeup of the town was 92.80% White, 2.65% African American, 3.41% from other races, and 1.14% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 15.91% of the population. In 2014, the population was estimated to be 258.

==Geography==
Woodson is located in north-central Texas. It is situated at the junction of U.S. Highway 183 and Farm Roads 209 and 1710 in southeastern Throckmorton County, about southeast of Throckmorton.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.6 square mile (1.7 km), all land.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Woodson has a humid subtropical climate, &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Wildlife==

Woodson is situated in semiarid rolling hills covered in mesquite with &quot;jumping&quot; and prickly pear cactus, &quot;blue brush&quot;, and occasional live or post oaks. It has hot, dry summers and cold, dry winters. The creek bottoms have huge pecan trees, hackberry, willow, &quot;china berry&quot;, &quot;chitelm&quot;, elm, cottonwood, and wild plums of several kinds, as well as many other trees of various types occurring at times (bois d&#x27;arc and mulberry are seen). The ground along creeks may be covered in green briars, poison ivy, or oak, and Virginia creeper grows high into the trees in places. The land, as a whole, is a patchwork of mesquite, and farm fields dotted with old oil wells. It is home to white-tailed deer, wild turkey, cotton-tailed and jack rabbits, feral hogs, bobcats, raccoons, opossums, rattlesnakes, bobwhite quail, mourning doves, armadillos, coyotes, and occasionally a badger, beaver, fox, mountain lion, and even javalina is seen. Song birds and others thrive. Many small animals dwell there, such as fox squirrels, hispid cotton rats, soft-shelled turtles, and others too numerous to mention. Large yellow catfish live in the slow-moving rivers or in the local lake and stock tanks (ponds), along with many other fish such as channel catfish, large-mouthed bass, crappie, gar, carp, buffalo fish, drum, bream, and goggle-eyed sun perch. Red-horse minnows, top-water minnows, and a species locally known as bull-head minnows live in the ponds and thrive in the rippling shallows of the river and creeks.

==1948 tornado==
When a tornado hit Woodson in 1948, the population had decreased to 500. Still, 32 houses were destroyed.

==Japanese balloon bomb==
On March 23, 1945, a rancher on the Barney Davis Ranch, north of Woodson, Ivan Miller, found a balloon bomb in his field. The war in Europe was coming to an end, so attention was turned to finishing the job against the Japanese in the Pacific. However, the balloons obviously failed, as one ended up in a local field and the other was in Eastland County&#x27;s Desdemona. Japan released over 9,000 hydrogen-filled balloons with antipersonnel and incendiary ordnance attached, and released them in the jetstream.

Miller&#x27;s widow recalled later that he described the balloon to be &quot;as big around as a house,&quot; with a large rising sun painted on its top and several smaller versions around the bottom.

About 360 bombs were eventually found in North America, though government officials requested that all pieces be returned.

==Surrounding communities==
When Woodson was at its peak population, it had &quot;suburbs&quot; of sorts—surrounding communities with their own families, businesses, and school, which all eventually consolidated into Woodson ISD in the late 1930s. 

* Titus: located west of town at the corner of Highway 209 and FM 2850
* Lusk: located south of town
* Masters: located north of town off of FM 1710
* Sunshine
* Hustuttle: located off of the Crystal Falls highway, past the turn to Eliasville
* Whiz Bang: Around 1930, a small boom town appeared near Woodson, on the road from Woodson to Masters (now 1710) Now, only a few crumbled cement blocks of the refinery remain.

==Education==
Public education is provided by the Woodson Independent School District. WISD is home of the Woodson Cowboys and Cowgirls, and the school colors are black and gold. The school motto is &quot;Be The Best You Can Be&quot;. 
Prekindergarten through 12th grade can attend WISD, and as of 2016, 149 students were in school, with 29 faculty and staff members. Despite the small numbers, Woodson offers many extracurricular activities, such as:
* Junior and high school basketball
* Junior and high school volleyball
* Junior and high school football
* Junior and high school track and cross country
* Junior and high school cheerleading
* Tennis
* Golf
* FFA
* National Honor Society
* One Act Play
* UIL academic events
* School newspaper
* Robotics
==Sources of income==
Farming and ranching were the main sources of income until 1923, when the first oil well was completed. In 1925, the Stubblefield #1 well drilled by the Texas Oil Company (Texaco) came in; it has since produced more than 1,000,000 barrels (160,000 m3) from that one well and in 2010 was still producing. This set off a local drilling boom, and Texaco even built a refinery north of Woodson, in Whiz Bang. Besides working the land and in the oil field, residents of Woodson can find employment through Woodson ISD, BJB Transport, and the Jones Trailer Company.

<text>Talco is a town in Titus County, Texas, United States. The population was 494 at the 2020 census. The name is derived from a local candy bar (It was either a shelf carton or because the local people said it was &quot;Texas-Arkansas-Louisiana Country hence Talco). Also reports said it may have been a local company name Texas-Arkansas-Louisiana Company.

==History==
Two post offices were established near the current site of Talco: Gouldsboro in 1856 and Goolesboro in 1878. Due to name conflict the community changed its name to &quot;Talco&quot; based on the Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana Candy Company initials on a candy wrapper. In 1912, Talco relocated to be closer to a railroad line.

Oil was discovered in 1936, leading to a big boom in the economy. Talco called itself the &quot;Asphalt capital of the world.&quot;

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.8 square mile (2.0 km), all land.

US Route 271 is the major north–south highway passing through Talco. The community is one mile east of the Franklin County line.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 494 people, 258 households, and 206 families residing in the city.

==Education==
The City of Talco is served by the Rivercrest Independent School District (Talco-Bogata Consolidated Independent School District prior to July 1999).

It previously maintained Talco Elementary. The previous Talco school opened in 1939. The district began construction of the consolidated elementary on May 1, 2000 and the scheduled completion was in June 2001.

<text>Winfield is a small city in Titus County, Texas, United States. The population was 422 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Winfield&#x27;s history includes (in addition to railroad operations) coal mining, brick and pottery manufacturing, and the famous Winfield Truck Stop.

When the Texas and St. Louis Railway was being constructed through western Titus County in 1880, the citizens of Gray Rock, on the western boundary of the county, were asked to donate money and land to the company for routing the road through their community. When the merchants refused to cooperate, W. C. Barrett deeded a portion of his land a mile northeast of Gray Rock to railroad officials for a depot, and the road was built north of Gray Rock. At its earliest stages the community that began to emerge around the depot was called Barrett, but when the post office was opened there in 1887, with Patrick H. Carr as postmaster, the village was called Carr. In 1892 the name was changed to Winfield, in honor of the general passenger agent for the railroad, W. H. Winfield. In 1890, the population was reported at forty-seven. By 1896 the town had three churches, several stores, a pottery operated by J. S. Hogue, and a population estimated at 150. During the early years of the twentieth century, the town experienced its greatest period of growth. By 1914 it had a brick company, a newspaper, numerous stores and gins, two banks, and a population estimated at 700. The two banks merged in 1919, and the resulting bank closed in the early 1920s. By 1925 the population of Winfield had declined to 629, and by the 1940s it was 350. The town was incorporated in the 1940s and maintained a relatively stable population for several decades. In 1980 residents numbered 349, and in 1982 the town had five rated businesses. In 1990, the population was 345.

==Geography==
Located on Interstate 30, approximately halfway between Mount Pleasant and Mount Vernon, Winfield is the second largest town in Titus County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.9  square mile (2.4 km), of which 0.9  square mile (2.4 km) is land and 1.06% is water.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Winfield has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 422 people, 140 households, and 129 families residing in the city.

==Education==
Winfield is now served by Mount Pleasant Independent School District for grades K–12. Mount Pleasant High School is the local high school.

Winfield Independent School District served Winfield until 2018. Winfield ISD had one school, Winfield Elementary, that served students in grades kindergarten through eight, while Mount Pleasant ISD and Mount Pleasant HS served the district at the high school level only.

<text>Christoval is a census-designated place (CDP) in Tom Green County, Texas, United States. Its population was 504 at the 2010 census. It is part of the San Angelo, Texas, metropolitan statistical area.

==Geography==
Christoval is located at (31.197614, -100.493296). It is situated about 20 miles south of San Angelo in southern Tom Green County around the area of Loop 110, U.S. Highway 277, and Ranch to Market Road 2084.

According to the United States Census Bureau in 2000, the CDP has a total area of 1.2 sq mi (3.1 km), all land. Prior to the 2010 census, the CDP gained area, increasing to a total area of , all land as before.

The South Concho River runs through Christoval, and serves as a water supply to the surrounding area. It was the location of a resort from the 1930s to the early 1960s, near where U.S. 277 crosses the river.

==History==
The community, which has also been known as South Concho and Delong, is said to be named after early settler Christopher Columbus Doty. A post office was established in 1889, and a local school was operating by 1901. By 1914, Christoval had an estimated population of 200, two general stores, and a newspaper – the &quot;Christoval Observer&quot;. Through the 1930s, a Baptist encampment was held annually that attracted as many as 10,000 persons to the South Concho River area, and the mineral waters in nearby Christoval also attracted visitors and settlers.

On September 17, 1936, a devastating flood hit the South Concho River. The flood destroyed the Baptist encampment facility, and parts of Christoval. Several people were killed in the flood, as they were swept away by the rapidly rising water. Following the flood, the encampment facilities were never rebuilt, and the property eventually became a public park.

Playland Park was a popular local attraction from the 1950s through the 1980s. The park offered public access to the river, as well as boat rentals, a rope bridge, tree swings, and a concession stand. At its peak in the 1970s, the facility had amusement park rides and a small train. The facility was closed in the 1980s due to liability concerns and smaller crowds. Today, Pugh River Park and the historic, low-water river crossing on Loop 110 offer public access to the South Concho River.

The population peaked at approximately 500 in the 1930s before declining to about 400 in the mid-1950s, and 200 by the mid-1970s. The rerouting of U.S. Highway 277 in 1987 was expected to bring a further decline, but the population was not significantly impacted by the change. In 2000, 29 businesses were operating in Christoval.

==Notable people==

Christoval is the hometown of Jack Pardee, a former American football linebacker and the only head coach to lead teams in college football, the NFL, the United States Football League, and the Canadian Football League. Pardee was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1986. He was an All-American linebacker at Texas A&amp;M University and a two-time All-Pro with the Los Angeles Rams (1963) and the Washington Redskins (1971).

Christoval is also hometown to reality TV personality Colby Donaldson, who appeared in several seasons of the CBS show &quot;Survivor&quot;.

==Local attractions==

The South Concho River runs through Christoval, and around three-quarters of a mile of riverfront is part of a public park. The shoreline in this area is covered by large oak trees, and the trees have rope swings for visitors. This park, known as Pugh River Park, has visitors from across West Texas each weekend. Crowds over 500 people are not uncommon on the weekends in the summer.

Public access to the South Concho River is also available at the Mineral Wells crossing, about a mile north of Christoval.

Each Memorial Day weekend, the community of Christoval holds Old Toenail Trail days, which attracts visitors from around the region. Festivities include live music, parades, and food and craft vendors.

<text>Sir Joseph Wilson Swan FRS (31 October 1828 – 27 May 1914) was an English physicist, chemist, and inventor. He is known as an independent early developer of a successful incandescent light bulb, and is the person responsible for developing and supplying the first incandescent lights used to illuminate homes and public buildings, including the Savoy Theatre, London, in 1881.

In 1904, Swan was knighted by King Edward VII, awarded the Royal Society&#x27;s Hughes Medal, and was made an honorary member of the Pharmaceutical Society. He had received the highest decoration in France, the Legion of Honour, when he visited the 1881 International Exposition of Electricity, Paris. The exhibition included displays of his inventions, and the city was lit with his electric lighting.

==Early life==
Joseph Wilson Swan was born in 1828 at Pallion Hall in Pallion, in the Parish of Bishopwearmouth, Sunderland, County Durham. His parents were John Swan and Isabella Cameron.

Swan was apprenticed for six years to a Sunderland firm of pharmacists/druggists, &quot;Hudson and Osbaldiston&quot;. However, it is not known whether Swan completed his six-year apprenticeship, as both partners subsequently died. He was said to have had an enquiring mind, even as a child. He augmented his education with a fascination for his surroundings, the industry of the area, and reading at Sunderland Library. He attended lectures at the Sunderland Atheneum.

Swan subsequently joined Mawson&#x27;s, a firm of manufacturing chemists in Newcastle upon Tyne, started in the year of Swan&#x27;s birth by John Mawson (9 September 1819 – 17 December 1867), the husband of his sister, Elizabeth Swan (22 November 1822 – 2 August 1905). In 1846, Swan was offered a partnership at Mawson&#x27;s. This company subsequently existed as &quot;Mawson, Swan, and Morgan&quot; until 1973, formerly located on Grey Street in Newcastle upon Tyne, near Grey&#x27;s Monument. The premises, now occupied by fashion retailer END., can be identified by a line of Victorian-style electric street lamps in front of the store on Grey Street.

Swan lived at Underhill, Low Fell, Gateshead, a large house on Kells Lane North, where he conducted most of his experiments in the large conservatory. The house was later converted into Beaconsfield School, a private fee-paying grant-aided co-educational grammar school. Students there could still find examples of Swan&#x27;s original electrical fittings.

==Electric light==

In 1850, Swan began working on a light bulb using carbonised paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. By 1860, he was able to demonstrate a working device, but the lack of a good vacuum, and of an adequate electric source, resulted in an inefficient light bulb with a short life. In August 1863 he presented his own design for a vacuum pump to a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. The design used mercury falling through a tube to trap air from the system to be evacuated. Swan&#x27;s design was similar in construction to the Sprengel pump and predates Herman Sprengel&#x27;s research by two years. Furthermore, it is notable that Sprengel conducted his research while visiting London, and was probably aware of the annual reports of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Nonetheless, Joseph Swan and Thomas Edison are later reported to have used the Sprengel pump to evacuate their carbon filament lamps.

In 1875, Swan returned to consider the problem of the light bulb with the aid of a better vacuum and a carbonised thread as a filament. The most significant feature of Swan&#x27;s improved lamp was that there was little residual oxygen in the vacuum tube to ignite the filament, thus allowing the filament to glow almost white-hot without catching fire. However, his filament had low resistance, thus needing heavy copper wires to supply it.

Swan first publicly demonstrated his incandescent carbon lamp at a lecture for the Newcastle upon Tyne Chemical Society on 18 December 1878. However, after burning with a bright light for some minutes in his laboratory, the lamp broke down owing to excessive current. On 17 January 1879 this lecture was successfully repeated with the lamp shown in actual operation; Swan had solved the problem of incandescent electric lighting by means of a vacuum lamp. On 3 February 1879 he publicly demonstrated a working lamp to an audience of over seven hundred people in the lecture theatre of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne, Sir William Armstrong of Cragside presiding. Swan turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament, and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce &quot;parchmentised thread&quot;, and obtained British Patent 4933 on 27 November 1880. From that time he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England.
His house, Underhill, Low Fell, Gateshead, was the world&#x27;s first to have working light bulbs installed. The Lit &amp; Phil Library in Westgate Road, Newcastle, was the first public room lit by electric light during a lecture by Swan on 20 October 1880. In 1881 he founded his own company, The Swan Electric Light Company, and started commercial production.

The Savoy, a state-of-the-art theatre in the City of Westminster, London, was the first public building in the world lit entirely by electricity. Swan supplied about 1,200 incandescent lamps, powered by an generator on open land near the theatre. The builder of the Savoy, Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte, explained why he had introduced Swan&#x27;s electric light: &quot;The greatest drawbacks to the enjoyment of the theatrical performances are, undoubtedly, the foul air and heat which pervade all theatres. As everyone knows, each gas-burner consumes as much oxygen as many people, and causes great heat beside. The incandescent lamps consume no oxygen, and cause no perceptible heat.&quot; The first generator proved too small to power the whole building, and though the entire front-of-house was electrically lit, the stage was lit by gas until 28 December 1881. At that performance, Carte stepped on stage and broke a glowing lightbulb before the audience to demonstrate the safety of Swan&#x27;s new technology. On 29 December 1881, &quot;The Times&quot; described the electric lighting as visually superior to gaslight.

The first private residence, other than the inventor&#x27;s, lit by the new incandescent lamp was that of his friend, Sir William Armstrong at Cragside, near Rothbury, Northumberland. Swan personally supervised the installation there in December 1880. Swan had formed &quot;The Swan Electric Light Company Ltd&quot; with a factory at Benwell, Newcastle, and had established the first commercial manufacture of incandescent lightbulbs by the beginning of 1881.

Swan&#x27;s carbon rod lamp and carbon filament lamp, while functional, were still relatively impractical owing to low resistance (needing very expensive thick copper wiring) and short running life. While searching for a better filament for his light bulb, Swan inadvertently made another advance. In 1881, he developed and patented a process for squeezing nitrocellulose through holes to form conducting fibres. His newly established company (which by merger eventually became the Edison and Swan United Company) used Swan&#x27;s cellulose filaments in their bulbs. The textile industry has also used this process.
The first ship to use Swan&#x27;s invention was &quot;The City of Richmond&quot;, owned by the Inman Line. She was fitted with incandescent lamps in June 1881. The Royal Navy also introduced them to its ships soon after; with HMS &quot;Inflexible&quot; having the new lamps installed in the same year. An early employment in engineering was during the digging of the Severn Tunnel, where the contractor Thomas Walker installed &quot;20-candlepower lamps&quot; in the temporary pilot tunnels.

Swan was one of the early developers of the electric safety lamp for miners, exhibiting his first in Newcastle upon Tyne at the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers on 14 May 1881. This required a wired supply, so the following year, he presented one with a battery and other improved versions followed. By 1886, a lamp with better light output than a flame safety lamp was in production by the Edison-Swan Company. However, it suffered from problems of reliability and was not a success. It took development by others over the next 20 years or so before effective electric lamps were in common use.

==Conjunction with Edison==

In what are considered to be independent lines of inquiry, Swan&#x27;s incandescent electric lamp was developed at the same time that Thomas Edison was working on his incandescent lamp, with Swan&#x27;s first successful lamp and Edison&#x27;s lamp both patented in 1880. Edison&#x27;s goal in developing his lamp was for it to be used as one part of a much larger system: a long-life high-resistance lamp that could be connected in parallel to work economically with the large-scale electric-lighting utility he was creating. Swan&#x27;s original lamp design, with its low resistance (the lamp could be used only in series) and short life span, was not suited for such an application.
Swan&#x27;s strong patents in Great Britain led, in 1883, to the two competing companies merging to exploit both Swan&#x27;s and Edison&#x27;s inventions, with the establishment of the Edison &amp; Swan United Electric Light Company. Known commonly as &quot;Ediswan&quot;, the company sold lamps made with a cellulose filament that Swan had invented in 1881, while the Edison Company continued using bamboo filaments outside of Britain. In 1892, General Electric (GE) began exploiting Swan&#x27;s patents to produce cellulose filaments, until they were replaced in 1904 by a GE developed &quot;General Electric Metallized&quot; (GEM) baked cellulose filaments.

In 1886, Ediswan moved production to a former jute mill at Ponders End, North London. In 1916, Ediswan set up the UK&#x27;s first radio thermionic valve factory at Ponders End. This area, with nearby Brimsdown subsequently developed as a centre for the manufacture of thermionic valves, cathode-ray tubes, etc., and nearby parts of Enfield became an important centre of the electronics industry for much of the 20th century. Ediswan became part of British Thomson-Houston and Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) in the late 1920s.

==Photography==

When working with wet photographic plates, Swan noticed that heat increased the sensitivity of the silver bromide emulsion. By 1871, he had devised a method of using dry plates, and substituting nitrocellulose plastic for glass plates, thus initiating the age of convenience in photography. Eight years later, he patented bromide paper, developments of which are still used for black-and-white photographic prints.

In 1864, Swan patented the transfer process for making carbon prints, a permanent photographic process. By adding the transfer step, Swan was able to easily make photographs with a full tonal range.

==Honours==
In 1894, Swan was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), and in 1898 he was elected president of the Institution of Electrical Engineers; at the time, Swan was one of its three honorary members, the other two being Lord Kelvin and Henry Wilde. In September 1901, he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) from Durham University. He also served as president of the Society of Chemical Industry from 1900-1901, and in 1903 he was chosen first president of the Faraday Society. In 1904, he was knighted, awarded the Royal Society&#x27;s Hughes Medal, and made an honorary member of the Pharmaceutical Society. In 1906, he received the Albert medal of the Royal Society of Arts.

In 1945, the London Power Company commemorated Swan by naming a new 1,554 GRT coastal collier SS &quot;Sir Joseph Swan&quot;.

==Personal life==
Swan married firstly Frances &quot;Fanny&quot; White, third daughter of William White, of Liverpool, at Camberwell Chapel, London, on 31 July 1862. They had three surviving children: Cameron, Mary Edmonds, and Joseph Henry. Frances died on 9 January 1868 and he married secondly Hannah White, the younger sister of Frances, at Neuchâtel, Switzerland, on 3 October 1871. They had five children: Hilda, Frances Isobel, Kenneth Rayden, Percival, and Dorothy. Sir Kenneth Rayden Swan was a QC and an acknowledged authority on patent law.

Swan died in 1914 at his home in Overhill, Warlingham, Surrey. The funeral took place at All Saints&#x27; Church, Warlingham, on 30 May 1914, with interment taking place in the churchyard. Mourners included representatives of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and the Royal Society.

<text>San Angelo ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Tom Green County, Texas, United States. Its location is in the Concho Valley, a region of West Texas between the Permian Basin to the northwest, Chihuahuan Desert to the southwest, Osage Plains to the northeast, and Central Texas to the southeast. According to the 2020 United States Census, San Angelo had a total population of 99,893. It is the principal city and center of the San Angelo metropolitan area, which had a population of 121,516.

San Angelo is home to Angelo State University, historic Fort Concho, and Goodfellow Air Force Base. It is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Angelo.

==History==

In 1632, a short-lived mission of Franciscans under Spanish auspices was founded in the area to serve native people.
The mission was led by the friars Juan de Salas and Juan de Ortega, with Ortega remaining for six months.
The area was visited by the Castillo-Martin expedition of 1650 and the Diego de Guadalajara expedition of 1654.

During the development the region, San Angelo was at the western edge of the region called Texas, successively claimed in the 1800s by the nations of Spain, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, and finally, the United States in 1846.

The city of San Angelo was founded in 1867, when the United States built Fort Concho, one of a series of new forts designed to protect the frontier. The fort was home to cavalry, infantry, and the famous Black Cavalry, also known as buffalo soldiers by American Indians.

The settler Bartholomew J. DeWitt founded the village of Santa Angela outside the fort at the junction of the North and South Concho Rivers. He named the village after his wife, Carolina Angela. The name was eventually changed to San Angela. The name would change again to San Angelo in 1883 on the insistence of the United States Postal Service, as San Angela was grammatically incorrect in Spanish. The town became a trade center for farmers and settlers in the area, as well as a fairly lawless cowtown filled with brothels, saloons, and gambling houses.

After being designated as the county seat, the town grew quickly in the 1880s, aided by being on the route of newly constructed railroads. It became a central transportation hub for the region. The Santa Fe Railroad arrived in 1888 and the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway in 1909. After a tuberculosis (TB) outbreak hit the United States in the early 1900s, many patients moved to San Angelo. At the time, doctors could only recommend rest in dry, warm climates. TB sufferers went to San Angelo for treatment, and a sanitarium was built in nearby Carlsbad.

In 1928, the city founded San Angelo College, one of the region&#x27;s first institutes of higher education. The city had been passed over by the Texas State Legislature to be the home of what would become Texas Tech University. San Angelo College, one of the first municipal colleges, has grown to become Angelo State University. The military returned to San Angelo during World War II with the founding of Goodfellow Air Force Base, which was assigned to train pilots at the time. San Angelo grew exponentially during the oil boom of the 1900s, when vast amounts of oil were found in the area, and the city became a regional hub of the oil and gas industry.

The San Angelo Independent School District is a public school district based in San Angelo, Texas, and became one of the first in Texas to integrate, doing so voluntarily in 1955.

San Angelo was famous for Miss Wool of America Pageant, an annual event organized by the National Wool Growers Association (U.S.)

<text>Jonestown is a city in Travis County, Texas, United States on the north shore of Lake Travis. The population was 2,365 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Jonestown was developed by brothers Warren and Emmet A. Jones in the 1930s when they recognized the opportunity presented by the upcoming Mansfield Dam on the Colorado River. Once the dam was complete, Jonestown would become waterfront property along the Sandy Creek Arm and Big Devil&#x27;s Hollow of the newly formed Lake Travis. The Jones brothers initially sold waterfront lots for $50 in 1939, raising the price to $100 and offering financing after complaints the original cost was too high.

The area had less than 1,000 residents until the late 1980s and residences were mostly weekend cabins. However, during this time the remote location also attracted &quot;bike gangs, drug dealers and other ne&#x27;er-do-wells&quot;, according to a 1999 Austin American-Statesman article.

The city officially incorporated in 1985, with city leaders encouraging growth in an attempt to leave the settlement&#x27;s less savory history behind. Following incorporation, growth was initially rapid, with the 1988 population of 683 growing to 1,250 by 1990 but a regional real estate bust brought it to a halt &quot;circa&quot; 1990.

In 1992, the community had a budget of just over , a police force of two Travis County Sheriff&#x27;s deputies, and a volunteer fire department, but did not provide any utilities. In the early and mid-1990s there were several attempts to disincorporate the city due to concerns around increased taxes and ordinances. Residents opposed to dissolution expressed fear that Austin would annex the territory if the city were dissolved, an original driving concern for the city&#x27;s incorporation.

In 1996, Jonestown increased its borders by annexing a large parcel which had recently been bought by a real-estate development group. By 1999, the city had 1,500 residents and the Lake North area of Travis County, which includes Jonestown, had seen a 62% rise in median home prices from to in the five-year period from 1994 to 1999. These changes, along with a corresponding increase in its tax base, were welcomed by some residents as a way to increase city services. Others were unhappy with the changes feeling the population was growing too quickly. The population continued to increase, reaching 1,681 by 2000 and 1,834 by the 2010 census.

* Fireman&#x27;s Park and Shady Park, two small parks near the center of the city connected to each other by a footpath. Fireman&#x27;s Park is adjacent to the city&#x27;s only public transportation, a CapMetro Bus park-and-ride stop.
* Veterans Park, a small park near the city center containing the city&#x27;s veterans memorial. It is the only developed park north of RM 1431.
* Pecan Park, a small park along Big Sandy Creek also known as Pecan Bottom. It was officially turned into a public park after locals constantly maintained a rock dam in the creek.

==Economy and transportation==
In 2006, the first parts of a central Texas tollway system opened, which included State Highway 130, State Highway 45, and State Route 212. These roads increased accessibility to Manor. A Walmart was built on the east side of town near the junction of U.S. Highway 290 and FM 973. Manor Medical Center broke ground in 2013.

Manor has also been the location for a number of movies, notably &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape&quot; starring Johnny Depp. The story centered on a developmentally disabled boy, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who regularly disrupted the town&#x27;s tranquility by climbing Manor&#x27;s old water tower. The tank, although no longer used, remains a landmark in the downtown district. There were also several episodes of &quot;Fear the Walking Dead&quot; filmed in Manor.

Manor was initially considered as the site for a new international airport to replace the overcrowded Robert Mueller Municipal Airport; however, several environmental lawsuits were brought by the Sierra Club and others, slowing development until an alternative was presented by the closing of Bergstrom Air Force Base further south. This facility was rebuilt into Austin-Bergstrom International Airport which opened in 1999.

==Education==

The Manor Independent School District serves most of the City of Manor. President Obama visited Manor New Technology High School in 2013.

The park is a &quot;Smart Park&quot; with WiFi access and coded signage accessible by smartphones for retrieving historical and other information. The park consists of a gazebo, pavilion, and outdoor exercise equipment provided by a grant from the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department&#x27;s Steps to a Healthier Austin Program.

East Metro Park is a multiple-use recreational area with ball fields, soccer fields, basketball court, playscapes, hiking trails, stock ponds, and both free and fee reserved pavilions. The park also includes a swimming pool managed by the YMCA of Austin and is five minutes southeast of Manor.

==History==
Manor was named for James B. Manor, who settled on Gilleland Creek west of present-day downtown Manor.

A school for boys began operation northwest of the present Manor High School complex in 1854 and was followed in 1858 by a school for girls near the present Manor Elementary School. A post office was reestablished in the Manor home in 1859 under the name of Grassdale with James Manor serving as Post Master. A mercantile store was built in 1868 the present cemetery and was followed by a second store in 1869.

In late 1871 as the Houston and Texas Central Railway constructed the first railroad link to the Texas capital James Manor made a donation of right-of-way which brought the line through what is now the town. The inaugural train arrived in Austin on Christmas Day 1871. The following year the community of Manor was laid out and named. It was incorporated as a town in March 1913 and converted to a general law city in 1921 with expectations of continued growth. Following two devastating fires that destroyed most of the business district, coupled with the decline of cotton production after the arrival of the boll weevil, Manor remained a small city throughout most of the twentieth century.

<doc id="136707" wikidata="Q977467" url="?curid=136707" title="Sunset Valley, Texas">
<text>Sunset Valley is a city in Travis County, Texas, United States. The population was 683 at the time of the 2020 census. An enclave, it is surrounded on all sides by the city of Austin.

==Geography==

Sunset Valley is located 5 miles (8 km) southwest of downtown Austin.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.4 square miles (3.6 km2), all land.

==History==
Mexico&#x27;s passage of the General Colonization Law in 1825 enabled and encouraged immigration and settlement in unapportioned land. The first recorded land transactions in the Sunset Valley area occurred in 1835, while the region was still under the jurisdiction of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas. The state apportioned 25 labors of land (roughly equivalent to ) to Theodore Bissell and granted a similarly sized partition of land to the north to Thomas Anderson that same year. Located south of Austin, the apportioned land lay outside of the jurisdiction of Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s colony. Sections of the lands held by Bissell and Anderson were sold to and settled by buyers over the course of subsequent decades following the Annexation of Texas. In the early 1950s, brothers M.H. and Clarence Flournoy acquired a large tract of land away from Austin, including what would become Sunset Valley, to develop a subdivision. The Flournoys also drilled a well that would ultimately serve as the area&#x27;s first water system. A meeting of local residents led to the filing of a petition in 1954 to hold an election seeking to incorporate what had become known as Sunset Valley. The petition approximated the area to be incorporated as having an area less than and a population of over 200. The election was granted, and on September 13, 1954, voters supported incorporation by a 45–6 vote. On September 17, 1954, the Village of Sunset Valley was officially incorporated with Clinton Vilven as its first mayor. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Sunset Valley was known for the Christmas lights adorning homes along Sunset Trail, attracting visitors from the Austin area. The city also sponsored Texas&#x27;s largest youth rodeo, which annually drew 250–300 participants and thousands of attendees. The rodeo&#x27;s proceeds, along with a voluntary tax program, supported Sunset Valley&#x27;s revenue in its early years.

The growth of nearby Austinwhich impinged upon and eventually enveloped Sunset Valley&#x27;s city limitsled to frequent disputes over territory and jurisdiction. The borders of the newly incorporated Sunset Valley initially spanned from Prather Lane southwestward to Brodie Lane, and from Manchaca Road westward to the modern West Gate Shopping Center. However, in the decade following incorporation, several annexations and de-annexations led to confusion regarding Sunset Valley&#x27;s borders and further territorial disputes complicated the city&#x27;s borders. In 1963, the Texas Legislature granted incorporated areas extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ), giving municipalities the ability to regulate development in areas beyond their borders; the ETJs of Sunset Valley and nearby Austin overlapped. Additional annexations and de-annexations occurred between 1964–1973. In the 1970s, the Austin Independent School District&#x27;s (AISD) proposal to build an athletics complex and bus depot on Jones Roadwithin Sunset Valley&#x27;s jurisdictionmet opposition from the Sunset Valley community, and the city declined permit issuance for the facility. The resulting legal challenge mounted by the city of Austin culminated in the case &quot;AISD v. City of Sunset Valley&quot; (1973), in which the Supreme Court of Texas ruled in favor of AISD, leading to the construction of the complex in 1976. Sunset Valley&#x27;s first city hall was built in 1977. Although informal police protection in Sunset Valley began in 1954, a formal police department was established in 1979. While Sunset Valley began as a residential community, in 1990 the city approved the development of a retail center. By 1990, the population had grown to 327. A wastewater system was constructed in the early 1990s with a grant from the Texas Water Development Board. In 1998, Sunset Valley entered into an inter-local agreement with the city of Austin to provide firefighting services. The population rose to 365 by 2000, an 11.6 percent increase over the 1990 figure. 

In 2001, the United States Postal Service officially recognized Sunset Valley as a destination for mail delivery. While a vast majority of the city&#x27;s land remains residential, commercial development has increased in recent years.

<text>Trinity is a city in Trinity County, Texas, United States. The population was 2,343 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Trinity was founded in 1872 (possibly earlier as there is an 1870 Census for Trinity, Texas taken on 19 July, 1870) on land purchased from the New York and Texas Land Company. The town was a railroad station on the Houston and Great Northern Railroad.

The town was originally named Trinity Station after the Trinity River. The name of the town was later changed to Trinity City, then to Trinity. The town was incorporated in 1910.

===Civilian Conservation Corps===
A camp site for Civilian Conservation Corps Company 839 was established 1.6 miles east of Trinity on June 8, 1933. The company was under the command of Captain Charles H Brammel and the medical department was under the direction of Dr H H Thornton. The field activities of the camp were mainly construction and maintenance of fire lanes, fire break roads and telephone lines.

In 1907, Thompson Brothers&#x27; Lumber Company built a mill and 37 acre pond at Trinity. Texas Long Leaf Lumber Company, which started at Willard in 1912, bought Thompson Brothers&#x27; Trinity mill in 1922. Under management of Paul Sanderson for 22 years, the company was one of the nation&#x27;s most successful manufacturers of Yellow Pine and Southern Hardwoods. During World War II, production reached 140,000 board feet daily, resulting in lumber flown to Europe and Africa and the awarding of the Army-Navy &quot;E&quot; Award in 1944. As one of the largest employers in Trinity, the closing of the mill in 1955 had a devastating impact on the local economy.

===Hardin-Sublet Gunfight===
On August 7, 1872, John Wesley Hardin and Phil Sublet got into a gambling dispute at John Gates&#x27; Saloon. The saloon was a plank structure with a bar and a ten pin alley. After making peace, Sublet left the saloon and called out Hardin from the street south of the front door. Hardin appeared at that door and Sublet fired one shot at him. Hardin returned
fire not intending to kill him. Distracted, Hardin was pulled into a middle door and Sublet wounded him with the other barrel of his shotgun. Hardin then went after him through the streets and into a dry goods store. After a pistol malfunction, Hardin fired again and hit Sublet in the shoulder. Too weak from his wounds, Hardin was unable to pursue him.

==Historical development==
The town&#x27;s name came from one of the first conductors, W. T. Colmesneil, on the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, which ran through the county. The Trinity and Sabine Railroad extended a 66-mile line from Colmesneil to Trinity, establishing the town as the shipping focal point for the county from 1881. Timber and cattle were the foremost commodities to sell due to the steep slope of the terrain. From the 1880s, the Yellow Pine Lumber Company operated a mill there, and for a while, Colmesneil&#x27;s population was greater than that of Beaumont.

The surname &quot;Colmesneil&quot; is probably a misspelling for &quot;Colmesnil&quot;, a Norman surname originally designating &quot;someone from Colmesnil&quot;, a village in the traditional pays de Caux district, in département Seine-Maritime, Normandy, France.

==History==
Big Sandy is about southwest of Gilmer, Texas, at the intersection of U.S. Highway 80 and Texas State Highway 155 in Upshur County. It was established shortly after the American Civil War. The settlement was first known as Big Sandy Switch because a stretch of the Texas and Pacific Railroad was built through the area and eventually intersected with a narrow-gauge railroad called the Tyler Tap. A post office was followed by a newspaper, stores and churches. In 1926 the settlement was incorporated as Big Sandy, with a population of about 850.

===Worldwide Church of God===
During the 1950s, Big Sandy became linked to a religious movement that would greatly influence the community for four decades. Local resident Buck Hammer was a member of the Radio Church of God (which later became known as the Worldwide Church of God [WCG]), a California-based, Sabbatarian movement headed by radio evangelist Herbert W. Armstrong. Hammer donated a small parcel of land (less than 10 acres) to the church, which built a meeting hall and began holding annual church conventions there by the middle 1950s.

The church in subsequent years bought hundreds more acres adjacent to the original site. Thousands of church members converged on Big Sandy and surrounding communities for the week-long Feast of Tabernacles each year, creating a significant economic impact. In the mid-1960s Armstrong developed more of the property and established a second campus of Ambassador College, the original campus of which continued to operate at the church&#x27;s headquarters facility in Pasadena, California. The presence of the college, along with the annual convention operation, influenced hundreds of church members to relocate to Big Sandy and the surrounding area over the years. Although Ambassador ceased operations in 1997 (roughly a decade after Armstrong&#x27;s death and after his successor repudiated much of Armstrong&#x27;s original teachings), many families once affiliated with it and the church chose to remain in the Big Sandy area.

In March 2000, the campus was sold to the Green Family Trust (owner of Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.), which leased it to the Institute in Basic Life Principles. It was then developed as the International ALERT Academy, the home of the Air Land Emergency Resource Team (ALERT), a Christian program training young men in disaster relief and emergency services. The Academy also serves as a camp and conference center, and holds four-week summer programs for boys and girls. It now serves as the official headquarters of IBLP after it relocated from the Chicago area where it was founded (this took place after Bill Gothard, IBLP&#x27;s founder and president, resigned amidst controversy over allegations of sexual misconduct).

===Needlecraft businesses===

In the late 1970s, local residents Jerry Gentry and Annie Potter began a mail-order business from their home in Big Sandy and called it Annie&#x27;s Attic. The business grew rapidly into a multimillion-dollar enterprise, publishing magazines and catalogs for needlecraft enthusiasts. After the couple divorced in the early 1980s, Annie continued to preside over Annie&#x27;s Attic, while Jerry launched a near-replicate business called The Needlecraft Shop, also in Big Sandy. By the 1990s, both businesses had been purchased in separate transactions by Dynamic Resource Group (DRG), a publishing company in Berne, Indiana. DRG management moved both companies&#x27; operations to Indiana. Before doing so it established a new company, Strategic Fulfillment Group (SFG), on the southwest edge of Big Sandy. SFG, which handles mailing and subscription fulfillment for DRG and other clients, is now Big Sandy&#x27;s and Upshur County&#x27;s largest employer.

===&quot;Texas&#x27; Largest Manhunt&quot;===

On July 10–11, 1986, more than 1,000 law enforcement officers responded to Big Sandy Chief of Police Richard Lingle&#x27;s request for assistance after the convicted murderer Jerry &quot;The Animal&quot; McFadden escaped from the Upshur County jail. He took jailer Rosalie Williams, the wife of a Department of Public Safety trooper, as hostage. Lingle broadcast his call for help after Upshur County authorities were unable to track down McFadden and his hostage that evening. Responding officers securely cordoned off the city, leaving McFadden little chance of escape, and he was recaptured and returned to jail. Due to severe overcrowding in prisons, he had been paroled despite a past marked by violence, and committed additional crimes. McFadden was executed in October 1999 for the murder of Suzanne Denise Harrison, a teen from nearby Hawkins.

===Sports===

The Big Sandy High School football team won three Texas Class B state championships, in consecutive years 1973–1975. Although the state finals game in 1974 ended in a 0–0 tie (vs Celina), UIL granted both teams co-championships. In 2005, the Wildcats again reached the state 1-A finals, falling 21–20 to Stratford.

==History==
Before any settlement the indigenous Caddo were the dominant people living within the region and on the land.

The arrival of European settlers in the 18th and 19th centuries led to significant changes in the region, including the removal of these Indigenous peoples.

Originally part of the William Murray League, the area was first settled in the early 1850s by a group from Haywood County, Tennessee. They immediately started The Murray League Methodist Episcopal Church, South as well as the Murray League Institute. After the Civil War, rich iron ore deposits were discovered in the area and ore was mined sporadically from the 1860s through 1900.

Around 1910, a commercial company led by Colonel L.P. Featherstone was formed to mine ore in the East Texas Iron Ore Belt. He persuaded the Santa Fe Railway line to finance a rail link with Port Bolivar. Land for a new city was purchased and platted into streets and lots around 1911. The town was given the name Ore City and a post office was established soon after. By 1914, 30 miles of the line known as the Port Bolivar Iron Ore Railway had been built, connecting Ore City with Longview. The newly founded community had an estimated population of 400. Further construction on the railroad line was halted by the outbreak of World War I. Colonel Featherstone&#x27;s company went into bankruptcy and the rail line was abandoned in 1927. Ore City survived and by 1936, around 500 people lived in the community. During World War II, the federal government built a steel plant 10 miles north of Ore City to mine the same ore that previously brought Colonel Featherstone to the area. The plant was completed just as the war ended and was sold to a Texas group as surplus property. They operated it as the Lone Star Steel Company.

Ore City was incorporated in 1951. At that time, the number of residents had fallen to 385.

Growth resumed in the mid-1960s and by 1976, Ore City had a population of 900, with 34 businesses operating in the city. More than 1,000 people lived in the city by the year 2000.

===Decline and Stabilization===
As with many other mining-based towns, the depletion of resources led to a decline in population and economic activity over time. By the mid-20th century, mining operations had slowed considerably, and Ore City&#x27;s growth stabilized as a small, rural community, falling short of becoming a potential Boomtown. 

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 1,106 people, 350 households, and 252 families residing in the city.

Twenty years earlier, in the census of 2000, 1,106 people, 403 households, and 295 families resided there. At that time the population density was . The 432 housing units averaged 191.5 per square mile (73.8/km). The racial makeup of the city was predominantly White, comprising 68.41% of the population. Black or African Americans made up 6.05%, while Native Americans or Alaska Natives accounted for 1.81%. Asians represented 0.54%, and those identifying as Mixed or Multiracial constituted 5.96%. Additionally, Hispanic or Latino individuals comprised 17.24% of the population.

Of the 403 households, 37.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 57.3% were married couples living together, 13.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.6% were not families. About 22.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.74 and the average family size was 3.23. In the city, the population was distributed as 31.8% under the age of 18, 8.7% from 18 to 24, 28.0% from 25 to 44, 18.1% from 45 to 64, and 13.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32 years. For every 100 females, there were 89.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.6 males. The median income for a household in the city was $33,542, and for a family was $37,750. Males had a median income of $28,250 versus $18,333 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,997.

== Economy ==

Ore City, Texas, part of the Longview metropolitan area, has an economy that&#x27;s traditionally tied to its small-town roots in agriculture, timber, and tourism related to nearby Lake O&#x27; the Pines. Located in East Texas and near the more developed regions of Longview and Marshall, Ore City is relatively modest in scale and maintains a completely rural economic profile. It doesn&#x27;t experience the kind of industrial or tech-driven growth seen in larger Texas cities but is more reliant on local businesses, agriculture, and nearby employment centers.

During the iron boom in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Ore City had a prime opportunity to diversify its economy but ultimately struggled to do so. The town&#x27;s economy relied heavily on the iron industry, and when iron ore was discovered nearby, it led to a surge of mining and related activities. However, this boom didn&#x27;t last long, and local economic strategies were almost solely focused on exploiting this one resource, with limited investment in other sectors like infrastructure, services, or secondary industries that could support long-term economic stability.

One major issue was that Ore City lacked the transportation and logistics infrastructure that could have supported broader industrial diversification. Without significant rail connections or investment in better roads, it was challenging to attract new industries to the area. As a result, when the iron ore deposits began to dwindle or became too costly to extract, the town found itself with limited economic fallback options.

Furthermore, the town&#x27;s reliance on iron prevented it from developing the agricultural or manufacturing industries that nearby regions were investing in. Many residents, whose livelihoods depended on mining, faced unemployment and hardship as demand for local iron faded. Without significant efforts to diversify, Ore City was left vulnerable to economic downturns, a trend that continues to impact its economic development today.

===State government===
Ore City is represented in the Texas Senate by Republican Bryan Hughes, District 1, and in the Texas House of Representatives by Republican Cole Hefner, District 5.

<text>McCamey is a city in Upton County, Texas, United States. Its population was 1,831 at the 2020 census. The Texas legislature has declared McCamey &quot;the Wind Energy Capital of Texas&quot; because of the many wind farms that have been built in the area. Its history, however, is primarily that of an oil boomtown.

==History==

McCamey is named for George B. McCamey, whose 1925 wildcat well brought about the oil boom in the region. He brought in a real estate developer from Corpus Christi, to lay out a townsite near the oil field and along the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway capable of housing 10,000 people. The town was initially a jumble of tents and frame shacks; order came slowly, replacing the lawlessness of the early boomtown environment. A post office was built in 1926, and the town was incorporated near the end of that year. In 1927, the McCamey Independent School District was formed, and an enterprising newspaperman printed the first issue of the &quot;Tri-County Record&quot;, the first town newspaper.

Water supply was a problem in the early years of McCamey, as the nearby water sources were not drinkable. Water came in by train from Alpine, almost away, at a cost of $1 a barrel. A potable water supply was found in a geologic unit only distant, and pipes were built to transport it to town in 1929.

McCamey was the location of a Humble Oil Company Refinery, one of the first built in West Texas. Humble Oil &amp; Refining Company was a corporate predecessor of Exxon Company. An early experiment by Shell Oil Company in massive oil storage in McCamey proved a failure; local oilmen built a reservoir to hold up to one million barrels of oil in an earthen tank, but the limestone formation underneath the tank cracked under the weight of the crude, allowing much of it to leak into the subsurface.

The population of the town declined during the Great Depression along with the price of oil, and as the discovery of large oil fields elsewhere pulled workers away. In 1940, 2,600 people were in McCamey; in 1980, 2,436; and the 2000 census showed the population had shrunk to 1,805.

<text>Rankin is a city in and the county seat of Upton County, Texas, United States. Its population was 780 at the 2020 census. It is named after F.E. Rankin, a local rancher. In 2020, only 3,308 people lived in the entire county, and McCamey was the only larger town. During the early 20th century, the town grew due to the discovery of oil in the nearby Yates Oil Field.

The discovery of the Yates Oil Field in adjacent Pecos County in 1926 converted Rankin into a boom town. Since Rankin was the nearest settlement on a rail line, it became the center for the oil-services industry for the nearby oil fields.

A hospital, three new schools, and a library date from this period. The population has gradually fallen since its secondary peak of 1,278 in 1980.

<text>Del Rio (in Spanish, &quot;Del Río&quot;, &quot;from the river&quot;) is a city in and the county seat of Val Verde County in southwestern Texas, United States. As of 2020, Del Rio had a population of 34,673.

==History==
The Spanish established a small settlement south of the Rio Grande in present-day Mexico, and some Spanish colonists settled on the north side of the Rio Grande as early as the 18th century. 

The United States acquired the territory following the Mexican War and, after the American Civil War, Paula Losoya Taylor in 1862 was the first Anglo-American to build a &quot;hacienda &quot; in the area. 

San Felipe Springs, about east of the Rio Grande on the U.S. side of the border, has historically produced of water a day. This was critical to the arid region. Developers acquired several thousand acres of land adjacent to the springs, and to San Felipe Creek formed by the springs, from the state of Texas in exchange for building a canal system to irrigate the area. 

The developers sold tracts of land surrounding the canals to recover their investment and show a profit. The initial investors (William C. Adams, Joseph M. Hudson, John P. Grove, Donald Jackson, John Perry, Joseph Ney, Randolph Pafford, A. O. Strickland, and James H Taylor) formed the San Felipe Agricultural, Manufacturing, and Irrigation Company in 1868. The organization completed construction of a network of irrigation canals in 1871 to support agriculture. Residents referred to the slowly developing town as San Felipe Del Rio. Local lore among the Tejanos said the name came from early Spanish explorers, who offered a mass at the site on St. Philip&#x27;s Day, 1635.

In 1883, local residents requested a post office be established. The United States Postal Department shortened &quot;San Felipe del Rio&quot; to &quot;Del Rio&quot; to avoid confusion with San Felipe de Austin. In 1885, Val Verde County was organized and Del Rio was designated as the county seat. The City of Del Rio was incorporated on November 15, 1911.

The San Felipe community was started by the Arteaga family. Arteaga Street and Arteaga Park are named after them. Together the communities are still part of a rural region.

Ranchers and farmers recruited Mexican workers during the early decades of the 20th century, especially during World War II, when so many American men were at war. After the war, the government withdrew visas and deported workers, including some who were citizens, as well as children born here.

Like many border communities, Del Rio has been affected in the early 21st century by migrants arriving from Mexico, Central and South America. Migrants from the Caribbean have also crossed the border here.

In September 2021, approximately 30,000 Haitian migrants crossed the border at Del Rio. The United States Border Patrol moved many to a camp underneath the Del Río–Ciudad Acuña International Bridge. The squalid conditions in the camp attracted widespread national attention.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.24%, is covered by water.

Del Rio lies on the northwestern edges of the Tamaulipan mezquital, also called the South Texas brush country. It is also near the southwestern corner of the Edwards Plateau, which is the western fringe of the famous, oak savanna-covered Texas Hill Country; that area is dotted with numerous small springs; one of these is the San Felipe Springs, which provides a constant flow of water to San Felipe Creek. The creek supplied fresh water for drinking and irrigation to early settlers of Del Rio, and the springs are still the town&#x27;s water supply.

The Del Rio region, to just west of the Pecos River, has a mix of desert shrub and steppe vegetation depending on soil type, with the gray-leafed cenizo (&quot;Leucophyllum&quot; spp.), several different acacias, cacti, and grama grasses dominant members of local flora. The terrain is mostly level, but some areas are dissected with substantial canyons and drainages, though none of the upland areas are elevated enough to be considered mountains.

===Climate===
Del Rio experiences a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;) with mild winters and hot, humid summers. High dewpoint temperatures occur during much of the warmer months, due to the terrain and prevailing surface winds from the southeast. In the spring and fall seasons, severe thunderstorms often build on the Serranías del Burro to the distant west of Del Rio, occasionally affecting Del Rio and uplands to the north. This occurs due to the uplift of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico which is channeled along the Rio Grande, combined with intense heating of lowland areas or frontal and dryline activity. Temperatures peak in late summer and then quickly drop during autumn.

<text>Canton is a city in and the county seat of Van Zandt County in East Texas, United States. It is located about 40 miles west of Tyler. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 4,229.

The city sustained severe damage on April 29, 2017, from several tornadoes, and two years later from another tornado that struck downtown on May 29, 2019, both of which occurred just before First Monday Trade Days, the popular flea market which draws thousands to the city each month.

== History ==
Canton was surveyed as early as 1840 by a company of men under Dr. W. P. King. The community stands on the original survey of Jesse Stockwell, an early settler in the area. No settlement was made until 1850, when the town was laid out and named by settlers moving from Old Canton in Smith County, Texas. The first district courthouse at Canton opened in 1850, and a post office, the county&#x27;s fourth, was established in that year.

When the Texas and Pacific Railway was built across the county in 1872, it missed Canton by , and the citizens of Wills Point persuaded county officials to move the county seat there. In the resulting dispute in 1877, armed residents of Canton went to Wills Point to recover the records, and the county judge wired Governor Richard B. Hubbard for aid. The Texas Supreme Court finally decided in favor of Canton. Unwilling to use the railroad at Wills Point, Canton businessmen established Edgewood, to the northwest of town, and built an extension to the railroad at a siding formerly called Stevenson.

Property for the town&#x27;s first school, the Canton Academy, was acquired in 1853. Sid S. Johnson began publication of the &quot;Canton Weekly Times,&quot; the county&#x27;s first newspaper, in 1860. A Grange was founded in 1876. By 1890, Canton had a population of 421, flour mills, sawmills, cotton gins, and a bank. Brick buildings were under construction by 1892, and a new brick courthouse was completed in 1894. Iron ore and anthracite coal were discovered in 1887 and 1891. By 1896, the town reached a population high of 800 and had several churches, a steam gristmill and gin, two weekly newspapers, three general stores, and two hotels, but the population had fallen back to 421 by 1904.

Canton was incorporated in 1919, and elected a mayor and aldermen. Despite the Great Depression, development of the Van oilfield after 1929 brought further expansion. A Public Works Administration project in the 1930s had the completion of a new courthouse. In 1933, area schools registered 500 white and 28 black students. The population reached 715 in 1940, but dwindled again after 1949. In the 1950s, local business included a sweet-potato curing plant, an ice factory, a concrete-tile factory, lumberyards, and a cotton gin. Expansion of the Canton city limits doubled its territory in the 1960s. In 1970, the community had a municipal lake with recreational facilities, seven churches, a school, a bank, a library, a newspaper, and 86 businesses. The population doubled between 1960 and 1970 from roughly 1,000 to 2,000, and reached nearly 3,000 by 1990. The population was 3,292 in 2000. However, when the city council decided to recount the population, they found that the town had 5,100 residents instead of the previous census total of 3,292.

Canton is known for its First Monday Trade Days. According to various sources, the tradition began with district court meetings held on the first Monday of each month, or with the monthly visit of neighbors during the days of the Confederate States of America. The custom began with the swapping of surplus stock by barter and grew to include casual bargaining for or swapping of dogs, antiques, junk, and donkeys on a grounds. It is so popular that Canton goes from a town of 5,100 to a town of over 30,000 during each First Monday weekend, making it the largest flea market in the world. In the past, due to the success of First Monday, the city of Canton had no property tax. However, as of 2006, that is no longer the case.

Canton also holds the Van Zandt County Fair and Rodeo and an Annual Bluegrass Festival, which takes place in August. Between 2003 and 2007, Canton was the host community for the United States Equestrian Drill Championship (Super Ride), which showcases top color guard and mounted drill teams from throughout the country.

On April 29, 2017, the city and county sustained severe damage from four tornadoes. One of these tornadoes was rated EF4, making it one of the two strongest tornadoes of the year. Reports of four fatalities and dozens of injured prompted opening of displacement shelters as a disaster declaration was made for Van Zandt County. Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered state resources to the area to offer assistance to local officials.

On May 29, 2019, the city and county sustained extensive damage from a tornado that struck the downtown area, near First Monday Trade Days. No deaths or injuries occurred, but several houses and local businesses were severely damaged or destroyed. The tornado struck the intersection of Texas State Highways 19 and 64.

<text>Grand Saline is a city in Van Zandt County, Texas, United States, located in East Texas. The population was 3,107 as of 2020, making Grand Saline the third-largest city in Van Zandt County. The city is located roughly 75 miles (120 km) east of Dallas and 35 miles (56 km) northwest of Tyler, the two nearest metropolitan areas, and is part of the greater Tyler/Longview area.

The town derives its name from the large salt deposits located southeast of the city, the majority of which are owned by Morton Salt.

==History==

Grand Saline&#x27;s first settlers were the ancient Caddo and Cherokee Indian tribes, who discovered and made use of a large salt prairie south of the town. The Native Americans used evaporated salt, from the brine stream that flows over the flats, as a commodity they traded for other needed goods. In the mid-nineteenth century, the tribes moved southeast, having been forced out of the area by Mirabeau B. Lamar, second president of the Republic of Texas, and by general anti-Indian sentiment. Only a few years after the Indians left the salt prairie behind, a new group of settlers arrived. A settler named John Jordan and other newcomers brought their families and set up a primitive salt works. The community named Jordan&#x27;s Saline quickly became the center of Van Zandt County and was, for a while, the county seat.
The salt produced here was used in the process of tanning leather and preserving food stuffs. Following the American Civil War the Texas and Pacific Railroad was extended from Marshall to Dallas. A parcel of land was donated to the railroad; a depot was built and the stop was named Grand Saline. The City of Grand Saline was incorporated in 1895 and the community of Jordan&#x27;s Saline faded into history as its residents moved north to the bustling new city.

There were formerly numerous salt companies in Grand Saline, including the Richardson Salt works, which had drilled the first salt well; the Lone Star Salt Company; Kleer Salt Works, the first steam-powered salt plant; and the Grand Saline Salt Company, which later became part of the Morton Salt Company. During the late 1920s, the discovery of the nearby Van oil field brought companies that provided needed supplies. In the 1930s Grand Saline had twelve petroleum supply companies and five lumber companies. In the Depression years, local sewing rooms made garments for the poor. During World War II, a workers&#x27; strike at Morton Salt led the town to form the Grand Saline Industrial Foundation to attract new business to town. Their efforts produced clothing manufacturers, sulfur processing and meat packing companies. Grand Saline was also known for its Lone Star Hotel, which was, for a brief time, the home of Hollywood starlet Louise Fazenda, the wife of Warner Brothers executive Hal Wallis. Agriculture, farming and ranching have long been a major part of the economic life in Grand Saline. Crops have included sweet potatoes and other truck crops. A cotton gin built south of town in 1890 marked the beginning of many years of cotton production. Poultry, livestock, dairy products, lumber and an ice house all played a role in the formation and history of the town.

<text>Van is a city located in southeastern Van Zandt County, Texas, United States, approximately 26 miles northwest of Tyler. Its population was 2,664 at the 2020 census. The town draws its name from an early settler and school teacher, Henry Vance.

==History==
Van&#x27;s first settlers in the area had arrived by the time of the Civil War. By 1874, the town was named Swindall for George Swindall, who donated land for a school west of the present business district and land north of that site in 1891 to the Methodist Church. In 1894, schoolteacher Henry Vance, the town&#x27;s namesake, established a post office, and the name Van was chosen when the post office renamed the community.

A Pure Oil company survey near the town in 1927 led to the discovery of oil by W.T. Jarman on October 13, 1929. The Jarman no. 1 well flowed 147 barrels of oil from the Woodbine Formation at a depth of . Sun Oil, Shell Petroleum, the Texas Company, Pure Oil, and Humble became co-owners of the field, with Pure Oil as chief operator. By 1994, the Van Field had produced 502 million barrels of oil.

Van experienced an overnight oil boom, growing from a rural farming community with a school and post office, to an oil boomtown where 30 buildings, including hotels and stores, had been constructed in only 10 days. In 1930, the Texas Short Line Railway was extended from Grand Saline. The population numbered 894 throughout the 1930s. The population declined to 620 during World War II, as workers moved away to jobs in war-related industry, but increased steadily thereafter. Businesses in the community fluctuated from a high of 50 in 1934 to a low of 15 in 1945, but remained between 30 and 40 throughout most of the town&#x27;s history. Mechanization of the oilfield occurred in the 1940s, and by the 1950s, Van had a Humble Oil refinery, five churches, and a consolidated independent school district. A total of 591 wells made up the Van field when Pure Oil became a division of Union Oil in 1965. The population of Van grew from 1,103 in 1962 to 1,820 by 1974. The population reached just over 2,600 residents in 2013.

===May 2015 tornado===
On May 10, 2015, shortly after sunset, Van was struck by a strong tornado during the May 5–10, 2015 tornado outbreak sequence. According to the National Weather Service and tornado chasers, a severe thunderstorm spawned a tornado that touched down in a heavily wooded thicket just south of Van Zandt County Road 4609, just west of the small community of Primrose, 10 miles south of Van. The tornado path moved in a direct line north, crossing Texas State Highway 64, picking up strength as it crossed the Neches River, and then Interstate 20 just south of the town. The tornado went straight into the heart of Van, causing heavy damage to structures in the town. It destroyed the elementary school in the city that was a historical monument and then moved straight north through residential neighborhoods, destroying homes and causing massive structural damage. The tornado continued in a straight line north towards Grand Saline. The tornado dissipated 3.5 miles north of Van. Numerous homes and mobile homes were damaged or destroyed, and many trees and power lines were downed throughout Van. A nearby metal-frame industrial building was destroyed. A few well-built frame homes in the northern part of town were left with only interior walls standing. An oil pump derrick toppled to the ground, along with a large metal high-tension truss tower. Several barns and outbuildings were destroyed, as well. Two people were killed and 47 were injured, prompting local emergency management officials to declare a mass-casualty incident. The following day, the tornado was given a rating of EF3 from the National Weather Service office in Fort Worth.

<text>Wills Point is a city in Van Zandt County, Texas, United States. The population was 3,747 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Founded in 1873, Wills Point derives its name from an early American settler, William Wills, who had arrived in the area &quot;circa&quot; 1848. Wills eventually purchased a cabin from Adam Sullivan in 1852. The name &#x27;point&#x27; may also derive from the shape of the original timberline near the cabin, though there have been unsubstantiated arguments that the name relates to the area&#x27;s elevation. The layout of the city was the work of engineer General Grenville M. Dodge of the California Construction Company. The downtown streets were laid with red bricks upon packed sand in the 1920s by locals and remain in use. Downtown Wills Point has many of its original buildings that are over one hundred years old including the Wills cabin, a drug store, a dry good store, and a law office. Governor George W. Bush officially named Wills Point the Bluebird Capital of Texas in 1995.

The Majestic Movie theater was opened in 1926 by Karl C. LyBrand and was still family operated by Karl C. Lybrand III until its closure on October 4, 2010. It had been the oldest continuously operated movie theater in Texas run by a single family.
The Bruce &amp; Human Drug Company, located on the corner of 4th Street and James, was built in 1879 and is the oldest family owned drug store in Texas.

Wills Point is also the final resting place for Trailblazer, the first commercially operated monorail system in the United States.

GFA World, a Christian missionary organization, is located seven miles outside the city.

<text>Victoria is a city and the county seat of Victoria County, Texas, United States. The population was 65,534 as of the 2020 census. The three counties of the Victoria Metropolitan Statistical Area had a population of 111,163 as of the 2000 census. Its elevation is .

Victoria is located 30 miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico. It is a two-hour drive from Corpus Christi, Houston, San Antonio, and Austin.

The city is named for General Guadalupe Victoria, who became the first president of independent Mexico. It is the cathedral city of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Victoria in Texas.

==History==

The city of Guadalupe Victoria was founded in 1824 by Martín De León, a Mexican empresario, in honor of Guadalupe Victoria, the first President of the Republic of Mexico. Victoria was initially part of De León&#x27;s Colony, which had been founded that same year. By 1834, the town had a population of approximately 300.

During the Texas Revolution, Guadalupe Victoria contributed soldiers and supplies to pro-revolutionary forces. However, after James Fannin was defeated by the Mexican army at the Battle of Coleto, the town was occupied by Mexican forces. After Santa Anna was defeated at the Battle of San Jacinto, the town&#x27;s Mexican residents were driven out by Anglo settlers, who renamed it Victoria.

In 1840, a Comanche raid on nearby Linnville killed many residents of the town. A cholera outbreak occurred in 1846.

During the mid-19th century, the city developed a large population of European immigrants, particularly Germans. By the turn of the 20th century, Victoria was experiencing rapid population growth thanks to its position as a regional trade center. The city&#x27;s advantageous proximity to Gulf Coast ports, the larger cities of Austin, Corpus Christi, Houston, and San Antonio, and prosperous industries in agriculture and petrochemicals solidified its prominence.

The University of Houston–Victoria was founded in 1971 and remains there today.

In 2017, the Victoria Islamic Center mosque was destroyed by an arson attack. A 25-year-old Victoria man was convicted of the crime and sentenced to prison. A documentary film, &quot;A Town Called Victoria&quot;, was produced about the incident.

==Geography==
Victoria is located on the coastal plains of Texas about from the Gulf of Mexico and from the nearest bay waters. It lies along and just to the east of the Guadalupe River. The topography is mostly flat to slightly rolling with an average elevation of . Most of the city is underlain by smectite-rich clay which is locally capped by silt or fine sand; the high shrink-swell potential associated with smectite creates major challenges to urban infrastructure. Vegetation in better-drained areas consists primarily of short grasses with post oaks and other small timber and brush. Moist sites can grow tall forests dominated by elm and pecan.

===Climate===
Victoria is classified as having a humid subtropical climate. June through August are very hot and humid, with high temperatures regularly exceeding . The record high temperature of was recorded in September 2000. Victoria also holds the Texas record high for October at 109 °F (42.8 °C) recorded in 1926. Spring and autumn are generally mild to warm with lower humidity. Winters are mild, with occasional cold spells. The record low temperature was recorded in December 1989, when the temperature dropped to . Snow is very infrequent, occurring on average once every 11 years. On December 24–25, 2004, Victoria recorded its first White Christmas ever when  of snow fell.

Average monthly precipitation is lowest in winter and has a secondary minimum in August, with intense heat and humidity prevailing. On average, the wettest months are May, June, September and October (the last two of these due to significant threat from tropical weather systems, including hurricanes, which can produce torrential rainfalls some years).

Victoria has occasional severe weather, mostly from flooding. Hurricanes have the potential to bring severe damage to the area. Hurricane Claudette in July 2003 was the last hurricane to score a direct hit on the city. During this event, winds gusted to at the Victoria Regional Airport and 90% of the city lost power. The most intense hurricane to affect Victoria remains Hurricane Carla in September 1961.

In May 2013, a rare tornado hit Victoria on a Saturday afternoon with tornado warnings everywhere from Corpus Christi to the southeast Houston/Sugarland Metro area. A short-lived tornado took a swipe at an open field northeast of Victoria, dodging all structures and causing no injuries but kicking up dirt and debris visible for miles. Tornadoes striking the area are commonly associated with hurricanes and are otherwise rare.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Victoria is located at the intersection of three major U.S. highways:

* US Highway 59 (I-69 and I-69W) is a four-lane divided, interstate-quality highway extending southwest to Laredo and northeast to Houston, where it meets Interstate 10 and Interstate 45. It is also known as the Lloyd M. Bentsen Highway. US 59 is planned to be included within the future Interstate 69 from Victoria to Tenaha (once fully completed the mainline of Interstate 69 will travel from Brownsville, Texas to Port Huron, Michigan). US 59 is planned to be included within the future Interstate 69W from Victoria to Laredo.
* US Highway 77 (I-69E) travels north from Victoria to the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, intersecting Interstate 10, Interstate 35 and Interstate 37. US 77 travels south via a four-lane divided highway to the Rio Grande Valley. US 77 is planned to be included within the future Interstate 69E from Victoria to Brownsville.
* US Highway 87 travels northwest connecting Victoria to San Antonio, providing access to Interstate 35. US 87 also connects with Port Lavaca to the southeast.
