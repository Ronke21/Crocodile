It began as a large, dust-cloaked tornado northwest of Farmer in Hanson County, concurrent with the demise of the &quot;Fulton&quot; tornado. Continuing toward the east-southeast, it struck several farmsteads before crossing the Hanson/McCook County line a half mile west-northwest of Spencer.

<doc id="134954" wikidata="Q2366775" url="?curid=134954" title="Faith, South Dakota">
<text>Faith is a city in the northeastern corner of Meade County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 367 at the 2020 census. The most complete &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; skeleton known, Sue, was discovered approximately northeast of Faith in August 1990.

==History==
According to folk etymology, the town was named Faith because it took faith to live out on the prairie. However, the story of the city as documented in various informal, locally published histories, is that the town was named for Faith Rockefeller, one of the daughters of a major investor in the railroad responsible for founding the town. This is in keeping with the names of other towns on the route of the old railroad (now abandoned), such as Isabel, South Dakota. Faith was the permanent end of the railroad, a local spur off the Milwaukee Road Railroad. The city was established in 1910.

Founded as the town at the end of the railroad, Faith was originally the hub of a homestead boom in the period 1910–1920; but the drought conditions of the 1920s that led to the Dust Bowl of the 1930s quickly replaced abnormally wet conditions of the early 20th century, and the harsh winters of the northern plains quickly drove many sodbusters to more hospitable regions. The town&#x27;s location allows for ranch families in the area to have schools and stores closer than Sturgis, Fort Pierre, or other regional market towns, but early expectations of steady growth were never realized. Faith is still well known for its rodeos and livestock sales. The town&#x27;s location made it a necessary stop on the Sunset Trail, also known as the Yellowstone Trail.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Faith is located in the West River region of South Dakota, the section of the state located west of the Missouri River, and in the Northern Great Plains, on a ridge dividing the Cheyenne River to the south and the Grand River and its major tributary, the Moreau River to the north (both are tributaries of the Missouri).

Faith is the center of a vast cattle and sheep ranching area, and is the community center for hundreds of scattered ranchsteads. It is located in the extreme northeast corner of Meade County, South Dakota&#x27;s largest: it is approximately 100 miles (160 km) to Sturgis, the county seat. It is also located immediately west of the boundary of the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation, home to several Lakota bands organized into the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe (CRST). The region is well known for deer hunting and also offers pheasant, elk, and recently, prairie mountain lion hunting. A small reservoir, Durkee Lake, is approximately three miles south and offers a local recreation venue, with its boating, fishing, golf course, beach, and camping. Durkee Lake receives runoff water from Spook Creek, which is located about 6.2 miles (10 km) south of Faith.

<text>Sturgis is a city in Meade County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 7,020 as of the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Meade County and is named after Samuel D. Sturgis, a Union general during the Civil War.

Sturgis is notable as the location of one of the largest annual motorcycle events in the world: the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, which lasts for 10 days beginning on the first Friday of August.

Sturgis was named in honor of the Civil War Union General Samuel D. Sturgis. In 1889, Sturgis was designated as the county seat of the newly formed Meade County.

As part of the vast Ellsworth Air Force Base complex, the land north of Sturgis was dotted with 50 Minuteman missile silos. Minuteman missile silo L-5 is located from the center of the town.

==Education==
Students in Brandon are served by the Brandon Valley School District. As South Dakota allows parents to enroll their students at any school district, regardless of district boundaries, the school district also serves students from the surrounding areas.

The Brandon Valley School District currently operates one high school, one middle school, one intermediate school, and four elementary schools. Brandon Valley High School, Brandon Valley Middle School, Brandon Valley Intermediate School, Brandon Elementary School and Robert Bennis Elementary School are all located within Brandon&#x27;s city limits, while Valley Springs Elementary School is located a few miles east of Brandon in Valley Springs, and Fred Assam Elementary School is located a few miles west, in eastern Sioux Falls.

In fall of 2015, the Brandon Valley School District added an intermediate school. The school is adjacent to Robert Bennis Elementary School and educates fifth and sixth grade students. Because the city&#x27;s population had been increasing exponentially, district officials were concerned that Brandon Valley Middle School, which served grades 6–8, was reaching capacity. Voters living within the district voted to fund $5.95 million of the estimated $14 million required to build the school by way of property tax.

==Infrastructure==
Interstate 90, the longest interstate highway in the United States, is located along the city&#x27;s northern border with Corson and serves as a major east–west route through the city. South Dakota Highway 11 (known as Splitrock Boulevard in the city limits) runs a north–south route as well. Most businesses in Brandon are located on Splitrock Boulevard.

<text>Colton is a city in Minnehaha County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 738 at the 2020 census.

Colton has the name of J. E. Colton, a railroad official.

== History ==
=== Creation ===
The town started with a creamery in 1897, made by J. E. Colton. Other businesses started to form around the creamery, making a Main Street. In 1901, the founder started a newspaper called &quot;The Colton Courier&quot; that stayed in place for years. The three other shareowners were W. O. Colton and Dave Crooks, the founder of Colton&#x27;s Neighboring town, Crooks. Between 1905 and 1906 a railroad was built through Colton, which used to have passenger service. J. E. Colton was 53 years old when he died in 1910.

=== Schools ===
The first Colton school was made in 1879 by the town&#x27;s founder, J. E. Colton, and was a one-room schoolhouse. From 1903 to 1905 a new, larger schoolhouse was built in place of the old one and began to teach high school subjects. In 1907 a high school was built that was meant to put students through for two years each. It met that goal, but lasted no more than two years, being put out of use in 1909. 1913 started a new four-year high school with six teachers that lasted much longer. Near the end of 1924, a new school was built out of brick. It used the same standard system as the previous school. The school stopped being used in 1967 when the school of Tri-Valley was constructed, which combined the students of several small towns.

The city took its name from the Dells of the Wisconsin River, which were likened to the local rapids on the Big Sioux River.

==History==
Dell Rapids was originally named Dell City, but was renamed after the rapids of the Big Sioux River. After a fire broke out on the main street and burned most of the town, it was rebuilt out of Sioux Quartzite, a common rock in the area. The Chicago, Milwaukee, and Saint Paul Railroad built a railroad into the area, reaching Dell Rapids from Egan in 1881. Two large Sioux Quartzite quarries owned by LG Everist are operated via this rail line, which is now operated by LG&#x27;s subsidiary, the D&amp;I Railroad. The community celebrates its heritage with the annual &quot;Quarry Days&quot; in July, and in June, the city hosts &quot;Cootie Days&quot;, where rides and games are set up and available in the city&#x27;s park.

<text>The cochlea is the part of the inner ear involved in hearing. It is a spiral-shaped cavity in the bony labyrinth, in humans making 2.75 turns around its axis, the modiolus. A core component of the cochlea is the organ of Corti, the sensory organ of hearing, which is distributed along the partition separating the fluid chambers in the coiled tapered tube of the cochlea.

==Etymology==
The name &#x27;cochlea&#x27; is derived from the Latin word for &quot;snail shell&quot;, which in turn is from the Ancient Greek κοχλίας &quot;kokhlias&quot; (&quot;snail, screw&quot;), and from κόχλος &quot;kokhlos&quot; (&quot;spiral shell&quot;) in reference to its coiled shape; the cochlea is coiled in mammals with the exception of monotremes.

==Structure==
The cochlea (: cochleae) is a spiraled, hollow, conical chamber of bone, in which waves propagate from the base (near the middle ear and the oval window) to the apex (the top or center of the spiral). The spiral canal of the cochlea is a section of the bony labyrinth of the inner ear that is approximately 30 mm long and makes 2 turns about the modiolus. The cochlear structures include:
* Three &quot;scalae&quot; or chambers:
** the vestibular duct or &quot;scala vestibuli&quot; (containing perilymph), which lies superior to the cochlear duct and abuts the oval window
** the tympanic duct or &quot;scala tympani&quot; (containing perilymph), which lies inferior to the cochlear duct and terminates at the round window
** the cochlear duct or &quot;scala media&quot; (containing endolymph) a region of high potassium ion concentration that the stereocilia of the hair cells project into
* The helicotrema, the location where the tympanic duct and the vestibular duct merge, at the apex of the cochlea
* Reissner&#x27;s membrane, which separates the vestibular duct from the cochlear duct
* The &quot;osseous spiral lamina&quot;, a main structural element that separates the cochlear duct from the tympanic duct
* The basilar membrane, a main structural element that separates the cochlear duct from the tympanic duct and determines the mechanical wave propagation properties of the cochlear partition
* The organ of Corti, the sensory epithelium, a cellular layer on the basilar membrane, in which sensory hair cells are powered by the potential difference between the perilymph and the endolymph
* Hair cells, sensory cells in the organ of Corti, topped with hair-like structures called stereocilia
* The spiral ligament is a coiled thickening in the fibrous lining of the cochlear wall. It attaches the membranous cochlear duct to the bony spiral canal.

The cochlea is a portion of the inner ear that looks like a snail shell (&quot;cochlea&quot; is Greek for snail). The cochlea receives sound in the form of vibrations, which cause the stereocilia to move. The stereocilia then convert these vibrations into nerve impulses which are taken up to the brain to be interpreted. Two of the three fluid sections are canals and the third is the &#x27;organ of Corti&#x27; which detects pressure impulses that travel along the auditory nerve to the brain. The two canals are called the vestibular canal and the tympanic canal.

=== Microanatomy ===
The walls of the hollow cochlea are made of bone, with a thin, delicate lining of epithelial tissue. This coiled tube is divided through most of its length by an inner membranous partition. Two fluid-filled outer spaces (ducts or &quot;scalae&quot;) are formed by this dividing membrane. At the top of the snailshell-like coiling tubes, there is a reversal of the direction of the fluid, thus changing the vestibular duct to the tympanic duct. This area is called the helicotrema. This continuation at the helicotrema allows fluid being pushed into the vestibular duct by the oval window to move back out via movement in the tympanic duct and deflection of the round window; since the fluid is nearly incompressible and the bony walls are rigid, it is essential for the conserved fluid volume to exit somewhere.

The lengthwise partition that divides most of the cochlea is itself a fluid-filled tube, the third &#x27;duct&#x27;. This central column is called the cochlear duct. Its fluid, endolymph, also contains electrolytes and proteins, but is chemically quite different from perilymph. Whereas the perilymph is rich in sodium ions, the endolymph is rich in potassium ions, which produces an ionic, electrical potential.

The hair cells are arranged in four rows in the organ of Corti along the entire length of the cochlear coil. Three rows consist of outer hair cells (OHCs) and one row consists of inner hair cells (IHCs). The inner hair cells provide the main neural output of the cochlea. The outer hair cells, instead, mainly &#x27;receive&#x27; neural input from the brain, which influences their motility as part of the cochlea&#x27;s mechanical &quot;pre-amplifier&quot;. The input to the OHC is from the olivary body via the medial olivocochlear bundle.

The cochlear duct is almost as complex on its own as the ear itself. The cochlear duct is bounded on three sides by the basilar membrane, the &quot;stria vascularis&quot;, and Reissner&#x27;s membrane. The &quot;stria vascularis&quot; is a rich bed of capillaries and secretory cells; Reissner&#x27;s membrane is a thin membrane that separates endolymph from perilymph; and the basilar membrane is a mechanically somewhat stiff membrane, supporting the receptor organ for hearing, the organ of Corti, and determines the mechanical wave propagation properties of the cochlear system.

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
Between males and females, there are differences in the shape of the human cochlea. The variation is in the twist at the end of the spiral. Because of this difference, and because the cochlea is one of the more durable bones in the skull, it is used in ascertaining the sexes of human remains found at archaeological sites.

==Function==

The cochlea is filled with a watery liquid, the endolymph, which moves in response to the vibrations coming from the middle ear via the oval window. As the fluid moves, the cochlear partition (basilar membrane and organ of Corti) moves; thousands of hair cells sense the motion via their stereocilia, and convert that motion to electrical signals that are communicated via neurotransmitters to many thousands of nerve cells. These primary auditory neurons transform the signals into electrochemical impulses known as action potentials, which travel along the auditory nerve to structures in the brainstem for further processing.

===Hearing===
The &quot;stapes&quot; (stirrup) ossicle bone of the middle ear transmits vibrations to the &quot;fenestra ovalis&quot; (oval window) on the outside of the cochlea, which vibrates the perilymph in the &quot;vestibular duct&quot; (upper chamber of the cochlea). The ossicles are essential for efficient coupling of sound waves into the cochlea, since the cochlea environment is a fluid–membrane system, and it takes more pressure to move sound through fluid–membrane waves than it does through air. A pressure increase is achieved by reducing the area ratio from the tympanic membrane (drum) to the oval window (&quot;stapes&quot; bone) by 20. As pressure = force/area, results in a pressure gain of about 20 times from the original sound wave pressure in air. This gain is a form of impedance matching – to match the soundwave travelling through air to that travelling in the fluid–membrane system.

At the base of the cochlea, each &#x27;duct&#x27; ends in a membranous portal that faces the middle ear cavity: The vestibular duct ends at the oval window, where the footplate of the &quot;stapes&quot; sits. The footplate vibrates when the pressure is transmitted via the ossicular chain. The wave in the perilymph moves away from the footplate and towards the helicotrema. Since those fluid waves move the cochlear partition that separates the ducts up and down, the waves have a corresponding symmetric part in perilymph of the tympanic duct, which ends at the round window, bulging out when the oval window bulges in.

The perilymph in the vestibular duct and the endolymph in the cochlear duct act mechanically as a single duct, being kept apart only by the very thin Reissner&#x27;s membrane.
The vibrations of the endolymph in the cochlear duct displace the basilar membrane in a pattern that peaks a distance from the oval window depending upon the soundwave frequency. The organ of Corti vibrates due to outer hair cells further amplifying these vibrations. Inner hair cells are then displaced by the vibrations in the fluid, and depolarise by an influx of K+ via their tip-link-connected channels, and send their signals via neurotransmitter to the primary auditory neurons of the spiral ganglion.

The hair cells in the organ of Corti are tuned to certain sound frequencies by way of their location in the cochlea, due to the degree of stiffness in the basilar membrane. This stiffness is due to, among other things, the thickness and width of the basilar membrane, which along the length of the cochlea is stiffest nearest its beginning at the oval window, where the stapes introduces the vibrations coming from the eardrum. Since its stiffness is high there, it allows only high-frequency vibrations to move the basilar membrane, and thus the hair cells. The farther a wave travels towards the cochlea&#x27;s apex (the &quot;helicotrema&quot;), the less stiff the basilar membrane is; thus lower frequencies travel down the tube, and the less-stiff membrane is moved most easily by them where the reduced stiffness allows: that is, as the basilar membrane gets less and less stiff, waves slow down and it responds better to lower frequencies. In addition, in mammals, the cochlea is coiled, which has been shown to enhance low-frequency vibrations as they travel through the fluid-filled coil. This spatial arrangement of sound reception is referred to as tonotopy.

For very low frequencies (below 20 Hz), the waves propagate along the complete route of the cochlea – differentially up vestibular duct and tympanic duct all the way to the &quot;helicotrema&quot;. Frequencies this low still activate the organ of Corti to some extent but are too low to elicit the perception of a pitch. Higher frequencies do not propagate to the &quot;helicotrema&quot;, due to the stiffness-mediated tonotopy.

A very strong movement of the basilar membrane due to very loud noise may cause hair cells to die. This is a common cause of partial hearing loss and is the reason why users of firearms or heavy machinery often wear earmuffs or earplugs.

=== Pathway to the brain ===
To transmit the sensation of sound to the brain, where it can be processed into the perception of &quot;hearing&quot;, hair cells of the cochlea must convert their mechanical stimulation into the electrical signaling patterns of the nervous system. Hair cells are modified neurons, able to generate action potentials which can be transmitted to other nerve cells. These action potential signals travel through the vestibulocochlear nerve to eventually reach the anterior medulla, where they synapse and are initially processed in the cochlear nuclei.

Some processing occurs in the cochlear nuclei themselves, but the signals must also travel to the superior olivary complex of the pons as well as the inferior colliculi for further processing.

===Hair cell amplification===
Not only does the cochlea &quot;receive&quot; sound, a healthy cochlea &quot;generates&quot; and amplifies sound when necessary. Where the organism needs a mechanism to hear very faint sounds, the cochlea amplifies by the reverse transduction of the OHCs, converting electrical signals back to mechanical in a positive-feedback configuration. The OHCs have a protein motor called prestin on their outer membranes; it generates additional movement that couples back to the fluid–membrane wave. This &quot;active amplifier&quot; is essential in the ear&#x27;s ability to amplify weak sounds.

The active amplifier also leads to the phenomenon of soundwave vibrations being emitted from the cochlea back into the ear canal through the middle ear (otoacoustic emissions).

===Otoacoustic emissions===

Otoacoustic emissions are due to a wave exiting the cochlea via the oval window, and propagating back through the middle ear to the eardrum, and out the ear canal, where it can be picked up by a microphone. Otoacoustic emissions are important in some types of tests for hearing impairment, since they are present when the cochlea is working well, and less so when it is suffering from loss of OHC activity. Otoacoustic emissions also exhibit sex dimorphisms, since females tend to display higher magnitudes of otoacoustic emissions. Males tend to experience a reduction in otoacoustic emission magnitudes as they age. Women, on the other hand, do not experience a change in otoacoustic emission magnitudes with age.

===Role of gap junctions===
Gap-junction proteins, called connexins, expressed in the cochlea play an important role in auditory functioning. Mutations in gap-junction genes have been found to cause syndromic and nonsyndromic deafness. Certain connexins, including connexin 30 and connexin 26, are prevalent in the two distinct gap-junction systems found in the cochlea. The epithelial-cell gap-junction network couples non-sensory epithelial cells, while the connective-tissue gap-junction network couples connective-tissue cells. Gap-junction channels recycle potassium ions back to the endolymph after mechanotransduction in hair cells. Importantly, gap junction channels are found between cochlear supporting cells, but not auditory hair cells.

==Clinical significance==
=== Physical damage ===
Damage to the cochlea can result from different incidents or conditions like a severe head injury, a cholesteatoma, an infection, and/or exposure to loud noise which could kill hair cells in the cochlea.

=== Hearing loss ===
Hearing loss associated with the cochlea is often a result of outer hair cells and inner hair cells damage or death. Outer hair cells are more susceptible to damage, which can result in less sensitivity to weak sounds. Frequency sensitivity is also affected by cochlear damage which can impair the patient&#x27;s ability to distinguish between spectral differences of vowels. The effects of cochlear damage on different aspects of hearing loss like temporal integration, pitch perception, and frequency determination are still being studied, given that multiple factors must be taken into account in regard to cochlear research.

===Bionics===
In 2009, engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology created an electronic chip that can quickly analyze a very large range of radio frequencies while using only a fraction of the power needed for existing technologies; its design specifically mimics a cochlea.

==Other animals==
The coiled form of cochlea is unique to mammals. In birds and in other non-mammalian vertebrates, the compartment containing the sensory cells for hearing is occasionally also called &quot;cochlea,&quot; despite not being coiled up. Instead, it forms a blind-ended tube, also called the cochlear duct. This difference apparently evolved in parallel with the differences in frequency range of hearing between mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates. The superior frequency range in mammals is partly due to their unique mechanism of pre-amplification of sound by active cell-body vibrations of outer hair cells. Frequency resolution is, however, not better in mammals than in most lizards and birds, but the upper frequency limit is – sometimes much – higher. Most bird species do not hear above 4–5 kHz, the currently known maximum being ~ 11 kHz in the barn owl. Some marine mammals hear up to 200 kHz. A long coiled compartment, rather than a short and straight one, provides more space for additional octaves of hearing range, and has made possible some of the highly derived behaviors involving mammalian hearing.

As the study of the cochlea should fundamentally be focused at the level of hair cells, it is important to note the anatomical and physiological differences between the hair cells of various species. In birds, for instance, instead of outer and inner hair cells, there are tall and short hair cells. There are several similarities of note in regard to this comparative data. For one, the tall hair cell is very similar in function to that of the inner hair cell, and the short hair cell, lacking afferent auditory-nerve fiber innervation, resembles the outer hair cell. One unavoidable difference, however, is that while all hair cells are attached to a tectorial membrane in birds, only the outer hair cells are attached to the tectorial membrane in mammals.

The airport is mostly un-walled and open-air, and the check-in is completely outside. The airport is the primary gateway to Kauai for visitors (especially tourists), and has several rental car facilities. Five motion pictures have filmed scenes at the Lihue Airport: &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;, &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot;, &quot;Six Days Seven Nights&quot;, &quot;Soul Surfer&quot;, and &quot;The Descendants&quot;.

==Early history==
The British established a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trading post in 1763 in this area. Present-day Flandreau developed near there, with people attracted to the community because of trading business.

The town of Flandreau was originally settled in 1857, and named for U.S. Indian Agent Charles E. Flandrau. (In the early years, it was sometimes spelled as &#x27;Flandrau&#x27;.) Like other settlements in the region, it was abandoned within a year, as a result of threatening activities of the Yankton Sioux during the Indian Wars. They were trying to expel European Americans from their territory.

In 1869, following the American Civil War, the area was resettled by twenty-five families of Christianized Sioux from the Santee reservation. White settlement resumed in 1872. When Moody County was organized in 1873, Flandreau was designated as the county seat.

Richard F. Pettigrew of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, a relative of Pettigrew settlers in Flandreau, promoted establishing an Indian School at Flandreau as part of what was his successful 1889 campaign in the state legislature to be elected for the U.S. Senate. The federal government authorized a school here, and what was first known as the Riggs Institute was opened in 1892. The Bureau of Indian Affairs took over a former Presbyterian Church mission school for the facility.

It has been known as the Flandreau Indian School, an off-reservation Indian boarding school operated by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) (an agency established in 2006).

==Landmarks==
The Flandreau Indian Reservation of the Santee Sioux is in the area.

==Education==

<text>Hill City is the oldest existing city in Pennington County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 872 at the 2020 census. Hill City is located southwest of Rapid City on U.S. Highway 16 and on U.S. Route 385 that connects Deadwood to Hot Springs. Hill City is known as the &quot;Heart of the Hills&quot;, a distinction derived from its proximity to both the geographical center of the Black Hills, and the local tourist destinations.

The city has its roots in the Black Hills mining rush of the late 19th century. Tin mining was dominant in the 1880s and led to an influx of capital and people into the area. As the mining industry waned, tourism and timber became increasingly important industries to the area. With the establishment of Mount Rushmore in the 1940s, Custer State Park and the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, the Black Hills became known as a tourist destination, from which Hill City benefited. In recent years, the city has diversified to become a center for the arts in the area, featuring several art studios and festivals.

==History==
Human history in the area that became Hill City, and the greater Black Hills in particular, started by at least 7000 BC. The Arikara arrived by 1500 AD, followed by the Cheyenne, Crow, Kiowa and Pawnee. In the 19th century, the Lakota Sioux claimed the land, calling it &quot;Paha Sapa&quot;. In 1874, Major General George Armstrong Custer led an expedition into the Black Hills, during which gold was discovered in French Creek, south of Hill City. The discovery of gold opened the Black Hills, and the Hill City area, to mining. Hill City was first settled by miners in 1876, who referred to the area as Hillyo. This was the second American settlement in the Black Hills. Hill City is the oldest city still in existence in Pennington County. A post office was constructed and opened on November 26, 1877. The city almost became a ghost town when miners relocated to the northern Black Hills after the discovery of gold there.

In 1883, tin was discovered near Hill City, and the population rebounded. The Harney Peak Tin Mining, Milling, and Manufacturing Company made its headquarters on Main Street. The company was backed by English financiers and bought 1,100 prospecting sites around the area. As mining grew, the city became known for its wild living and was once referred to as &quot;a town with a church on each end and a mile of Hell in between.&quot; At one time, 15 saloons were located on Main Street. The company built the Harney Peak Hotel on Main Street to entertain its management and executives. Upon realizing the tin market was unsustainable, the company ceased operation in 1902.

Although a small school building was established previously, a main school building was constructed on Main Street in 1921. This school building was replaced in 2001 with the current high school. On July 10, 1939, a fire started outside of Hill City. Among those who battled the blaze was Hill City High School&#x27;s entire basketball squad, as well as several teachers and administrators. The United States Forest Service named the school boys one of the best crews who fought the fire. The school team name thus became the Hill City Rangers and was privileged as the only school district in the United States allowed to use Smokey Bear as its official mascot. Hill City was incorporated on March 21, 1945. The Harney Peak Hotel remained in operation until 1934. The building has been restored and is the current location of the Alpine Inn. This building is on the List of Registered Historic Places in South Dakota. The Black Hills Institute of Geological Research opened in 1973 and is involved in the excavation and display of dinosaur and other fossils. In 1992, the institute was engaged in a legal battle over ownership of the &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; fossil named &quot;Sue&quot;.

This city was one of the filming locations for TNT&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Lakota Woman: Siege at Wounded Knee&quot;.

===Railroad===

The main railroad lines that intersected Hill City were the Burlington Northern Line (also called the High Line), previously the Grand Island and Wyoming Central, operated by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company; and the Black Hills Central Line, a spur that extended from Hill City to Keystone. The High Line extended from Edgemont north through Hill City and terminated in Deadwood. This line reached Hill City in 1893, and the Black Hills Central Line was extended and reached Keystone on January 20, 1900. Narrow gauge trolley cars were operated at 45-minute intervals during the day on the High Line. The High Line discontinued its passenger service in 1949 and was fully abandoned in 1983. It is now the George S. Mickelson Trail, after being converted to a bike trail during the 1990s.
In 1957, the Black Hills Central Railroad, also known locally as the 1880 Train, opened a tourist passenger train on the Black Hills Central Line. In 1972, a flood destroyed the last mile of the Burlington Northern and Black Hills Central Lines that extended from Hill City to Keystone. This final mile was restored in 2001. The Black Hills Central Railroad restores era-style locomotives and train cars. It has been featured on television shows such as the &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; episode &quot;Snow Train&quot;, &quot;General Hospital&quot;, and the TNT mini-series &quot;Into the West&quot;. The railroad also made an appearance in the movie &quot;Orphan Train&quot;.

===Sue controversy===

On August 12, 1990, Sue Hendrickson, a volunteer for the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research discovered the fossil of what would become the most complete skeleton of a &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; ever discovered. The fossil was named &quot;Sue&quot; after the woman who discovered it. After discovery, excavation, and transport to the institute&#x27;s facilities in Hill City, controversy arose as to who the rightful owners of the fossil were. The parties in dispute were the land owner, Maurice Williams; the tribe, and thus the federal government; and the Black Hills Institute. On May 12, 1992, FBI agents seized Sue from the institute over the course of three days. The fossil was shipped to South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Through the ongoing court battle, it was finally decided that Maurice Williams was the owner of the fossil. The federal government later brought a 39-count, 153-charge indictment against the institute and several of its members, which was related to this case and other fossils. This case turned into the longest criminal trial in South Dakota state history. Peter Larson, the president of the institute, was convicted on two counts of customs violations, for which he served two years in federal prison. Sue was finally auctioned off by Sotheby&#x27;s auction house and sold by Maurice Williams to the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois for $8.36 million.

<text>Rapid City is the county seat of Pennington County, South Dakota, United States. It is the second-most populous city in the state, after Sioux Falls. It is located on the eastern slope of the Black Hills in western South Dakota and was named after Rapid Creek, where the settlement developed. The population was 74,703 as of the 2020 census.

Known as the &quot;Gateway to the Black Hills&quot; and the &quot;City of Presidents&quot; because of the life-size bronze president statues downtown, Rapid City is split by a low mountain ridge that divides the city&#x27;s western and eastern parts, called ‘The Gap.’ Ellsworth Air Force Base is on the city&#x27;s outskirts. Camp Rapid, part of the South Dakota Army National Guard, is in the city&#x27;s western part.

Rapid City is home to such attractions as Art Alley, Dinosaur Park, the City of Presidents walking tour, Chapel in the Hills, Storybook Island, and Main Street Square. The historic &quot;Old West&quot; town of Deadwood is nearby. In the neighboring Black Hills are the tourist attractions of Mount Rushmore, the Crazy Horse Memorial, Custer State Park, Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, The Mammoth Site and the museum at the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research. To the city&#x27;s east is Badlands National Park.

==History==
The public discovery of gold in 1874 by the Black Hills Expedition, led by George Armstrong Custer, brought a mass influx of European-American miners and settlers into Rapid City. A group of unsuccessful miners founded Rapid City in 1876, trying to create other chances; they promoted their new city as the &quot;Gateway to the Black Hills&quot;; it was originally known as Hay Camp. The &quot;Gateway&quot; nickname is shared by neighboring Box Elder. In February 1876, John Richard Brennan and Samuel Scott, with a small group of men, laid out Rapid City. It was eventually named for the spring-fed Rapid Creek that flows through it.

The land speculators measured off a square mile and designated the six blocks in the center as a business section. Committees were appointed to recruit prospective merchants and their families to locate in the settlement. Such merchants soon began selling supplies to miners and pioneers. The city&#x27;s location on the edge of the Plains and Hills and its large river valley made it a natural hub for the railroads that were constructed in the late 1880s from both the south and east. By 1900, Rapid City had survived a boom and bust and was developing as an important regional trade center for the Upper Midwest.

The Black Hills had become popular in the late 1890s, but Rapid City became a more important destination in the 20th century. Local entrepreneurs promoted the sights, the availability of the automobile for individual transportation, and construction of improved roadways after World War I led to many more tourists to this area, including President Calvin Coolidge and the First Lady in summer 1927. Coolidge announced that he would not seek reelection in 1928 from his summer office in Rapid City. Gutzon Borglum, already a noted sculptor, began work on Mount Rushmore in 1927, and his son, Lincoln Borglum, continued the work after Gutzon&#x27;s death in 1941. The work was halted due to the US need to invest in buildup for its entry into World War II; the sculpture was declared complete in 1941. Although tourism had sustained the city throughout the Great Depression of the 1930s, gasoline rationing during World War II decimated such travel. But investments in the defense industry and other war-related growth stimulated the placement of new military installations in the area, bringing more businesses and residents.

In 1930, the Rapid City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter inviting Al Capone to live in the Black Hills. South Dakota&#x27;s governor did not support the idea, and Capone declined.
In the 1940s Rapid City benefited greatly from the opening of Rapid City Army Air Base, later Ellsworth Air Force Base, an Army Air Corps training base. The local population nearly doubled between 1940 and 1948, from almost 14,000 to nearly 27,000. Military families and civilian personnel soon took every available living space in town, and mobile home parks proliferated. Rapid City businesses profited from the military payroll.

During the Cold War, the government constructed missile installations in the area: a series of Nike Air Defense sites were constructed around Ellsworth in the 1950s. In the early 1960s three Titan missile launch sites were constructed; these contained a total of nine Titan I missiles in Rapid City&#x27;s general vicinity. Beginning in November 1963, the land for 100 miles east, northeast and northwest of the city was dotted with construction of 150 Minuteman missile silos and 15 launch command centers. They were all deactivated in the early 1990s.

In 1949, city officials envisioned the city as a retail and wholesale trade center for the region. They developed a plan for growth that focused on a civic center, more downtown parking, new schools, and paved streets. A construction boom continued into the 1950s. Growth slowed in the 1960s.

After the Black Hills Flood of 1972, the worst natural disaster in South Dakota history, a building boom took place over the next decade to replace damaged structures. On June 9, 1972, heavy rains caused massive flash flooding along Rapid Creek through the city, killing 238 people and destroying more than $100 million in property.
In response to this devastation, Rapid City received an outpouring of private donations and millions of dollars in federal aid. It was able to complete a major part of its 1949 plan: clearing the area along the Rapid Creek and making the floodplain a public park. In other areas, new homes and businesses were constructed to replace those that had been destroyed. Rushmore Plaza Civic Center and a new Central High School were built in part of the area that was cleared. The high school opened in 1978, with the graduating class that year attending classes in both the original school (housed in what is now Rapid City High School and community theater) and the new one.

The rebuilding generated construction and related jobs that partly insulated Rapid City from the drop in automotive tourism caused by the 1974 Oil Embargo, but tourism was depressed for most of a decade. In 1978, Rushmore Mall was built on the city&#x27;s north edge, enhancing the city&#x27;s status as a local retail center.

In 1980, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in &quot;United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians&quot; that the federal government had not justly compensated the Sioux people for the Black Hills when it unilaterally broke a treaty guaranteeing the Black Hills to them. As a result, the federal government offered a financial settlement, but the Lakota Sioux declined on the principle that the theft of their land should not be validated. They still demand the return of the land. The settlement funds accrue interest. This land includes Rapid City, by far the largest modern settlement in the Black Hills. As of 2023, the dispute has not been settled.

In the 1980s, tourism increased again as the city hosted the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally; another decline occurred in the late 1990s. Fears that Ellsworth AFB would be closed under the BRAC review and base closure process in the 1990s and 2000s led to attempts to expand other sectors of the economy. Growth continued and the city expanded significantly during this period.

Today, Rapid City is South Dakota&#x27;s primary city for tourism and recreation. With the federal government&#x27;s approval of a Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory at the Homestake Mine site in nearby Lead, Rapid City is primed for advancements in technology, medicine, and scientific research.

===1972 Rapid Creek flood===
On June 9–10, 1972, extremely heavy rains over the eastern Black Hills of South Dakota produced record floods on Rapid Creek and other streams in the area. Nearly of rain fell in about six hours near Nemo, and more than of rain fell over an area of . According to the Red Cross, the resulting peak floods (which occurred after dark) left 238 people dead and 3,057 people injured. Total property destruction was estimated in excess of $160 million (about $964 million in 2018 dollars), which included 1,335 homes and 5,000 automobiles that were destroyed. The flood also nearly destroyed a popular children&#x27;s park: Story Book Island.

Runoff from this storm produced record floods (highest peak flows recorded) along Battle, Spring, Rapid, and Box Elder creeks. Smaller floods also occurred along Elk and Bear Butte creeks. Canyon Lake Dam, on the west side of Rapid City, broke the night of the flood, unleashing a wall of water down the creek. The 1972 flooding has an estimated recurrence interval of 500 years, which means that a flood of this magnitude will occur on average once every 500 years. Every year there is a 0.2% chance (1 in 500) that a similar event will occur. To prevent similar damage, the city has prohibited residential and business construction on its flood plain. Today the flood plain is used for civic functions such as golf courses, parks, sports arenas, and arboretums, based mostly on the landscape and temporary use by people.

In 2007, the Rapid City Public Library created a 1972 Flood digital archive that collects survivors&#x27; stories, photos and news accounts of the flood. The Journey Museum has an interactive display on the 1972 flood; this is an ongoing project to give future generations the best idea of how the people were affected and what changes the city made as a result of the major losses of life and property. Plans include the memorialization of all those who died from the flood by the preparation of individual biographies, so they may be remembered more fully.

==Geography==
Rapid City is located in the shadow of Black Elk Peak, which at , is the second highest point east of the Rocky Mountains, after Guadeloupe Peak in Texas at 8,571 feet.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

Rapid City is located on the eastern edge of the Black Hills, and has developed on each side of the Dakota Hogback. Rapid City&#x27;s &quot;Westside&quot; is located in the Red Valley between the foothills of the Black Hills proper and the Dakota Hogback, so named for the red Spearfish formation soils and the way the valley completely encircles the Black Hills. Rapid City has expanded into the foothills, with developments having been built on both ridges and in valleys developed, especially in the last 20 years. This arid edge area has a higher risk of wildfire, as shown by the Westberry Trails fire in 1988.

Skyline Drive follows the summits of the Dakota Hogback south from near Rapid Gap (where Rapid Creek cuts through the Hogback) to a large high plateau that forms the current south edge of Rapid City. The Central and Eastern portions of Rapid City lie in the wide valley of Rapid Creek outside the Hogback. It includes a number of mesas rising a hundred feet or more above the floodplain.

===Rapid Creek===
Rapid Creek flows through Rapid City, emerging from Dark Canyon above Canyon Lake and flowing in a large arc north of downtown. It descends to the southeast where the valley widens. Since the flood damage of 1972, the city has prohibited most development in the floodplain of Rapid Creek. It has adapted this green space for public uses: a series of parks, arboretums, and bike trails, which have reconnected the city to the creek for residents.

To the north, a series of ridges separate Rapid Creek from Box Elder Creek. Both older and new residential areas and commercial areas have developed here, along I-90. To the south, the terrain rises more steeply to the southern widening of the Dakota Hogback into a plateau dividing the Rapid Creek drainage from Spring Creek.

===Climate===

Rapid City has a transitional climate between a semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSk) and a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen: Dwa), and is part of USDA Hardiness zone 5b. Its location makes its climate unlike both the higher elevations of the Black Hills to the west and the Great Plains to the east. It is characterized by long arid summers and long dry winters, with short but distinct spring and autumn seasons. Precipitation averages annually, but has historically ranged from in 1974 to in 1946.

Winters are cold and dry, with January being the coldest month with a daily mean temperature of . Chinook winds can warm temperatures above , doing so on average about 20 times from December to February. Temperature inversions, however, occasionally produce warmer temperatures in the Black Hills. On average, highs do not climb above freezing on 43 days, while the low temperature reaches on an average of 18 nights. Snowfall is frequent but usually not heavy; March and April are typically the snowiest months. The seasonal total averages , although historically ranging from during 1980–81 to during 1985–86. Extensive snow cover does not remain for long, with only nine days seasonally with or more on the ground. Measurable snow has occurred in every month except July.

Compared to locations in the east, the area warms rather gradually early in the year, with the last measurable snow typically occurring in late April and precipitation totals beginning to increase; May snow occurs several times per decade. Toward the middle of the year, storms typically develop over the Black Hills during the afternoon and move onto the plains in the evening. Only in April through June have calendar-day precipitation amounts exceeding been observed. June 15, 1963, with , holds the single-day rainfall record; the record-wettest month is May 1996 with . Rapid City has an average of twenty clear to partly cloudy days and 67% of its possible sunshine in June. This is the traditional &quot;flood&quot; season for Rapid and other creeks in the Eastern Hills. Temperatures warm rapidly as summer approaches.

Summer in Rapid City has relatively pleasant temperatures, and is relatively dry (following a wet spring), and relatively sunny. July is the warmest month of the year, having a daily mean temperature of . An average of 32 days reach + highs and 5 with + highs. Due to the elevation and aridity, lows rarely remain at or above and during July and August fall to or below on an average 7.6 days. Rapid City records an average of nine thunderstorm days in August, but only of rain in that month.

Fall is a transition season: the average first freeze occurs in Rapid City on October 4 and in the Black Hills in late August through September. The Rapid City area&#x27;s first snowfall is usually in October, although higher elevations sometimes receive significant snow in September. Occasional cold fronts moving through the area bring blustery northwest winds.

Sunshine is abundant in the region in all months except December, averaging 2850 hours, 64% of the possible total, per year. 

Official extreme temperatures range from on February 2, 1996, up to on July 15, 2006; the record low daily maximum is on February 2, 1989, while the record high daily minimum is on July 8, 1985, and July 28, 1960. 

Rapid City had the record for an extreme temperature drop of , which was achieved on January 10, 1911, from to . This was due to the Chinook wind, but the record was lost to Spearfish, South Dakota, in 1942.

==Economy==
Rapid City&#x27;s economy is diverse, but industry is a small portion. Heavy and medium industrial activities include a Portland cement plant (constructed and owned for 84 years by the State of South Dakota and sold in 2003 to Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua, or GCC, a Mexican-based conglomerate); Black Hills Ammunition, an ammunition and reloading supplies manufacturing company; several custom sawmills, a lime plant, a computer peripheral component manufacturing plant, and several farm and ranch equipment manufacturers. Of particular note, this city is the center for the manufacture of Black Hills gold jewelry, a popular product with tourists and Westerners in general. The city is the site of the only American manufacturer of stamping machines used for the labeling of plywood and chipboard products.

Most gold mining has ceased in the Black Hills and was never conducted in or near Rapid City. Regional mining operations include for sand and gravel, as well as the raw materials for lime and Portland cement (including chemical-grade limestone, taconite iron ore, and gypsum) remains an important part of the economy.

The largest sector of the Rapid City economy is government services, including local, state, and federal. Major employers include Ellsworth Air Force Base, home of the 28th Bomb Wing flying the B-1B long-range bomber; the Army National Guard based at Camp Rapid and hosting annual exercises in the Black Hills, drawing troops from five to ten states; and various federal agencies, including the National Park Service, US Forest Service, and Indian Health Service.

Monument Health covers one of the largest geographic service areas in the United States. The health care sector employs more than 8,000 persons in the Rapid City area.

Tourism constitutes a major portion of the Rapid City economy, due to the proximity of Mount Rushmore, Sturgis, home of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally; Deadwood, and other attractions in the Black Hills. This city provides most services for the Motorcycle Rally. Prepared to satisfy the Rally&#x27;s demand for motel rooms, camp sites, and other services for tourists during the first week of August, Rapid City has the capacity to host other large events, such as conventions, and numerous associated tourists year-round.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Public Transit====
Rapid City is served by Rapid City Rapid Ride, which provides fixed route and demand response service to the region.

Rapid City has a municipally owned bus service, providing multiple bus stops and a headquarters in the city. It has limited city-to-city bus service along I-90. Charter bus services operate in the area, connecting Rapid City and Deadwood with cities in Colorado, Nebraska, and Iowa.

Intercity bus service to the city is provided by Jefferson Lines.

====Roads====

* Interstate 90
* Interstate 190
* US Highway 16
* South Dakota Highway 44
* South Dakota Highway 79

====Air====
Rapid City Regional Airport provides flights to the airline hub cities, and has general aviation operations, including wildfire fighting activities, and medical flight support to Rapid City medical facilities and regional Indian Health Service operations.

====Railroads====
Historically, Rapid City was primarily served by two railroads: the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway and the Milwaukee Road. Following extensive restructuring in the industry in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the city is now served only by the Rapid City, Pierre and Eastern Railroad (RCP&amp;E). Rapid City has no passenger train service, and was last served in 1960 by the C&amp;NW&#x27;s Dakota 400, a daily train from Chicago to Rapid City via Rochester.

===Power===
Rapid City is located on the boundary of the Western and Eastern power grids. It is served by the hydroelectric plants of the two Mainstem dams on the Missouri River, and the large coal fields and power plants of the Powder River Basin of Wyoming. It is located where the two national power grids connect with each other, allowing switching of electrical power from east to west and vice versa. Rapid City had its own coal-fired power plant but could not afford to meet current air pollution standards and closed it. Closed for similar reasons were coal-fired power stations near Gillette, Wyoming. The Ben French power station located within city boundaries shut down September 2012, more than two years ahead of its scheduled shutdown. Rapid City now obtains much of its power from the Missouri dams and importing it from elsewhere. Following the shut down of the plants dependent on coal, electrical rates have increased. The city has had to spend more to import electricity over a longer distance.

===Water===
Rapid City obtains most of its water supply from Rapid Creek and the alluvial aquifers associated with the creek, owning significant water rights in Pactola Reservoir located some west of the city, but does also obtain water from some springs in the vicinity, and has the ability to draw water from deep formations that receive water from recharge in areas of the Black Hills where the formations come to the surface. The heavy dependence on shallow alluvial aquifers is of some concern to planners, as most suburbs of Rapid City use septic systems for domestic sewage treatment. However, water supplies remain relatively good for future growth.

===Healthcare===
Hospitals include:
* Monument Health Rapid City Hospital, a level 2 Trauma Center, and the busiest emergency department in South Dakota with 57,000 visits annually.
* Black Hills Surgical Hospital
* Indian Health Service’s Oyate Health Center provides care to the Native American community

===Emergency services===
Emergency medical services are provided by the Rapid City Fire Department. Emergency medical transportation by rotor and fixed wing aircraft is provided by Black Hills Life Flight, and MARC (Medical Air Rescue Company).

The historical reference logo for the police emblem and uniform patch was designed in 2009. George Floyd&#x27;s uncle resides in Gettysburg and advocated for the logo to change for the two-person police force. The police patch and logo were removed in July 2020.

<text>Redfield is a city in and the county seat of Spink County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 2,214 at the 2020 census. The city was named for J. B. Redfield, a railroad official.

==Geography==

==History==
The first settlers arrived in the Redfield area in 1878, and a post office was established two years later under the name &quot;Stennett Junction.&quot; The &quot;Redfield&quot; name was adopted in 1881. The town became the seat of Spink County in 1886, following a six-year legal and political battle among several Spink County towns. Redfield rapidly became a major town in the region, due in part to its status as a railroad center—the town was a crossroads of two lines of the Chicago and North Western Railway, and was also served by the Milwaukee Road Railroad. Railroads brought supplies, people, and animals, and also provided for transportation of crops back East.

Redfield College was established in the town in 1887, and operated until 1932. In 1902 the &quot;Northern Hospital for the Insane,&quot; a state institution, opened on a campus just north of town. That facility remains in operation today as the South Dakota Developmental Center.

Redfield has been visited by three sitting Presidents of the United States: William McKinley in 1899, William Howard Taft in 1911, and Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936.

<text>Fort Pierre is a city in Stanley County, South Dakota, United States. It is part of the Pierre, South Dakota micropolitan area and the county seat of Stanley County. The population was 2,115 at the 2020 census.

The settlement of Fort Pierre developed around an 1832 trading post and fort situated on the west bank of the Missouri River, near the confluence with its tributary Bad River. Earlier European exploration was by the French in the early 1700s. An American-owned trading post had been operating near what became the fort since 1817, and in 2017 the city celebrated its bicentennial of continuous permanent settlement.

==History==
On March 30, 1743, Francois and Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La Vérendrye reached the area of present-day Fort Pierre during an expedition west from Quebec, a French colony in present-day Canada. They left a lead plate buried in a hill to claim the land for the King of France. In the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the United States acquired this area and the remainder of France&#x27;s vast territory west of the Mississippi River.

President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the Lewis and Clark Corps of Discovery Expedition in 1804 to explore the territory, especially by traveling west to the Upper Missouri and Platte rivers, in the hope of finding a water route to the Pacific Ocean. They met with the Teton Sioux on the south side of the mouth of the Bad River on September 24–28, 1804.

In 1817 fur trader Joseph La Framboise, Jr., an agent for the American Fur Company, established Fort Tecumseh a mile to the north, on what is now La Framboise Island in the Missouri River. The fur trade was highly lucrative and attracted competitors. In 1832, Pierre Chouteau, Jr., a major fur trader from St Louis, replaced that early facility with Fort Pierre Chouteau, a trading post and fort on the west side of the Missouri and north side of the Bad River&#x27;s mouth.

The city of Fort Pierre gradually developed around the trading post. Fort Pierre celebrated its Bicentennial in 2017, marking 200 years of continuous permanent settlement at the confluence of the Missouri and Bad rivers.

In 1880, the settlement of Pierre was founded on the east side of the Missouri River in Hughes. Because it was centrally located and reached first by the railroad, it was designated by the state legislature as the state capital when South Dakota was admitted as a state.

==Geography==
Across the Missouri River from Fort Pierre is the state capital of South Dakota, Pierre.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Although Fort Pierre is located in the Mountain Time Zone, most residents of the city use Central Time because of close social and economic ties with Pierre, which is located in the Central Time Zone.

Military Road is locally known as &quot;The Strip&quot; hosts a number of casinos and fireworks stores. These take advantage of the lack of these products in neighboring Nebraska.

Fewer than 100 people have jobs at the original facility. Acer has expressed interest in selling the facility.

Other companies are renting from the facility, including Alorica, which absorbed a number of Gateway phone jobs. They are handling the AT&amp;T account.

On August 18, 2008, MPC announced the lay-offs of 55 people currently employed (who were all former Gateway employees). On October 17, 2008, MPC laid-off 98 more employees at the former Gateway facility, many of whom were former Gateway employees.

Mars Petcare purchased the city&#x27;s Menu Foods plant in October 2007 and operated it until 2011, when the plant was turned over to Mars&#x27; Royal Canin division. In 2016 Royal Canin broke ground on a 45,000 sq ft addition to the plant and invested about $60 million in state-of-the-art facilities to enhance its production of specialty pet foods.

In response to steadily increasing demand for their pet food products, Royal Canin announced in February 2022 that they would invest another $185 million in new production lines at their North Sioux City plant, which is expected to create 149 new jobs. As of February 2022, Royal Canin was operating 12 production plants in Europe, Russia, Africa, East Asia, South America and North America.

<text>Java is a town in Walworth County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 121 at the 2020 census.

Java derives its name from Java coffee, and Coffee Town was an early variant name. Java received its name from railroad crews on the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway Line who would stop for coffee in the town prior to the railroad&#x27;s relocation in 1908.

== History ==
Java was founded in 1900, shortly after the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway Line was extended from Bowdle to the Missouri River. The village was incorporated into a town by election in 1903 after survey of the townsite by Surveyor George Merriman of Bowdle on September 5 of that year.

Many of the first homesteaders were of German, Russian, Dutch, English, and Hungarian ancestry. The Java Herald, the first newspaper serving the town, was established in 1903 by Carl F. Clement, and was printed in both English and German.

In 1904, the first municipal building, a jail, was erected, in addition to gravel streets and an engine house equipped with a fire engine, hoses, and other related items. Additionally, the Dakota Central Telephone Company installed a telephone booth and switchboard at The Java House, Java&#x27;s first hotel, founded in 1900 by H. A. Taylor. Later, wooden sidewalks, a water reservoir, a town hall, a town well, and a windmill (to grind grain) were added. These additions were paid by warrants issued by the town, and in 1906 a $2,000 bond issue was passed to remove the debt.

In 1905, the Kupp Brothers, J. C. and George, supervised the installation of a more permanent telephone system in the town for the Dakota Telephone Co.

By 1907, the town possessed fire protection, a cemetery association, water supply, municipal buildings, and improved telephone facilities. Another addition to the town was made when the Milwaukee Land Company had their property north of the railroad track surveyed and added.

From 1908-1909, the railroad company rerouted its track, passing north of the town by one-half mile. The citizens received a proposal from railroad officials to move the town north, however, this proposal was refused, and the town was served thereafter by a spur line constructed by the company.

By 1913, the town had a Catholic, a Presbyterian, a German Lutheran, and a German Congregational Church. In 1915, the wooden sidewalks along Main street were removed and replaced with cement sidewalks. Later that year, the town hall was remodeled, the jail was moved, a bell tower was constructed. In 1916, a municipal light plant was constructed. In 1921, a schoolhouse was constructed, and at this time Java was incorporated from a town into a city, and adopted the Mayor-Alderman form of government, the first mayor under this new system being Carl F. Clement. In 1939, a Public Works Administration project was begun, creating a waterworks system to include both commercial and private users.

In 1947, the city saw the creation of a park board that established a city park just west of the school house.
=== Java High School ===
In 1901, the first term of school was help in a building that had been relocated into town, serving twenty-three students, ranging in age from five to eighteen years. In 1903, a frame school building was built on the site two blocks east of Main Street and was used until 1921, when the fireproof brick schoolhouse was constructed.

<text>Mobridge also Kȟowákataŋ Otȟúŋwahe (Lakota: &quot;Kȟowákataŋ Otȟúŋwahe&quot;; lit. &quot;Over-the-River Town&quot;) is a city in Walworth County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 3,261 according to the 2020 census.

==History==

Located in territory that had long been occupied by the Lakota Sioux, Mobridge was founded by European Americans in 1906 following construction of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad through here. The town was named Mobridge for its railroad designation, a contracted form of Missouri Bridge, after the original railroad bridge over the Missouri River. The bridge was demolished by the Corps of Engineers in the early 1960s and replaced by a higher bridge due to the construction of the Oahe Dam.

There are disputed claims that some or all of chief Sitting Bull&#x27;s remains were moved by his surviving relatives and the Dakota Memorial Association on April 8, 1953 from Fort Yates, North Dakota, where he had been killed and buried, to Mobridge, which was near his birthplace. The Mobridge burial site is marked by a monument consisting of his bust on a granite pedestal; it overlooks the Missouri River. It was dedicated by the Dakota Memorial Association on April 11, 1953.

The Brown Palace Hotel in Mobridge is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Artist Oscar Howe (Yanktonai Dakota) painted a mural for the town&#x27;s auditorium. The Mobridge Masonic Temple was built in Egyptian Revival style in 1923.

The Human Services Center was established as a psychiatric hospital in 1882 and is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Yankton is commonly referred to as the &quot;River City&quot;, due to its proximity to the Missouri River and the importance the river played in the city&#x27;s settlement and development. Yankton has also earned the nickname &quot;Mother City of the Dakotas&quot;, due to the early important role it played in the creation and development of the Dakota Territory, which later became the 39th and 40th U.S. states of North and South Dakota.

Owing to the early exploitation of Fort Hays Limestone for cement manufacture, including shipment of cement to the construction of the Panama Canal, Yankton once also had the nickname &quot;Cement City&quot;.

==History==

===Native inhabitants===

The site of Yankton was occupied by the Yankton Sioux (Dakota) prior to the arrival of European settlers. As part of the vast Louisiana Purchase, the site of Yankton was visited by Lewis and Clark in 1804. In the journals of the expedition, the explorers write of a meeting on August 30, 1804, with members of the Yankton Sioux Tribe on a Missouri River bluff presently known as Calumet Bluff. As recently as 1857, the present day site of Yankton was occupied by a village of Yankton Sioux led by Chief &quot;Pa-le-ne-a-pa-pe&quot; (&quot;Struck by the Ree&quot;). Two years later, with the signing of the Yankton Treaty of 1858, the land was opened for settlement. The city was founded where the small Rhine Creek (renamed Marne Creek in World War I) flowed into the Missouri River. The city grew as a stop for steamboats to take on fresh water and supplies, especially after steamboat traffic boomed when gold was discovered in the Black Hills.

===Dakota territorial capital===

With two days left in his term, President James Buchanan signed a law on March 2, 1861, creating the Dakota Territory. Yankton was designated as the territorial capital, and newly inaugurated President Abraham Lincoln appointed his personal physician, William A. Jayne of Springfield, Illinois, as the first territorial governor. The territorial capitol building, a plain, two-story wooden structure, was located at the intersection of Fourth and Capitol Streets; the original structure has been demolished, but a replica of the building has been constructed in Yankton&#x27;s Riverside Park. Yankton served as the territorial capital until 1883 when the capital was moved to Bismarck (now the capital of North Dakota).

===Yankton Stockade===
In response to the Dakota War of 1862 in western Minnesota, Governor Jayne issued a proclamation on August 30, 1862, requiring every male between the ages of 18 and 50 in every settlement in eastern Dakota, be formed into militias to protect against expected attacks from the Native Americans. In response, the Yankton militia built a stockade at the corner of Third Street and Broadway Avenue of approximately 200,000 square feet. Settlers from the surrounding area, and as far away as Sioux Falls and Bon Homme County, fled to Yankton to seek shelter in the structure.

Although roving bands of Native Americans did approach Yankton over the course of several weeks, no attack ensued, and the stockade was eventually abandoned and torn down. There is a historical marker at the site of the former stockade.

Among the most notable events that occurred in Yankton while capital, Jack McCall, murderer of Wild Bill Hickok in Deadwood on August 2, 1876, was tried in Yankton for Hickok&#x27;s murder, found guilty, and was hanged on March 1, 1877, at the age of 24. His body is buried in a Yankton cemetery.

===Yankton College===

Due to the urging of the Reverend Joseph Ward of Yankton, the General Association of Congregational Churches in Dakota Territory voted in May 1881 to establish &quot;Pilgrim College&quot; in Yankton, which was to be the first private institution of higher learning in Dakota. When the college was incorporated in August 1881, the name had been changed to &quot;Yankton College&quot;. Classes commenced in October 1882, and Yankton College played a prominent role in the city for over 100 years.

Then, in 1983, the small liberal arts college was forced to close due to financial insolvency. After remaining vacant for several years, the historic campus, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was purchased by the United States Federal Bureau of Prisons for use as a minimum security prison. The Federal Prison Camp – Yankton houses approx 450 male inmates.

===River Port and the Flood of 1881===

Since its founding, Yankton enjoyed a natural advantage as a steamboat landing along the Missouri River due to the fact that its landing stretched along the entire length of the town&#x27;s riverfront. The first steamboat to reach Yankton from St. Louis arrived in 1859, providing goods and supplies to settlers and fur-traders in upper and central Dakota. Since then, the city continued to grow and quickly became the second largest city in South Dakota. The railroad reached Yankton in 1872. In 1874, gold was discovered in the Black Hills and prospectors rushed into Dakota Territory. By 1880, Yankton had become an established riverboat port on the Missouri River. It retained its position as the second largest city in South Dakota until the beginning of the 20th century.

The city&#x27;s status as an important port was literally crushed on March 27, 1881, when an ice dam on the Missouri River burst, sending flood waters and giant blocks of ice flowing towards the town.

The resulting flood waters continued to accumulate behind the debris, and by March 29, the town&#x27;s riverfront and downtown were covered in water, ice and rock, destroying or stranding several riverboats that were moored there. As a result of this flood, and the expansion of railroads as a preferred method of shipping goods, Yankton&#x27;s river boat traffic was reduced, and the city&#x27;s role as a prominent stopping point on the way west dwindled over the next several years.

Francis Marion Ziebach established the second newspaper in the area that became South Dakota, the &quot;Weekly Dakotan&quot;, in Yankton on June 6, 1861, bringing his outfit from Sioux Falls by team and wagon. A second newspaper, started by Francis Marion Ziebach, is still published today as the Yankton &quot;Press and Dakotan&quot;.

In 1882, the Human Services Center was established as a psychiatric hospital. On June 2, 1883, Dakota Territory Governor Nehemiah G. Ordway moved the territorial capital from Yankton to Bismarck, present-day North Dakota.

===National Register of Historic Places===

<text>Clinton is a city in and the county seat of Anderson County, Tennessee. Clinton is included in the Knoxville metropolitan area. Its population was 10,056 at the 2020 census.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Prehistoric Native American habitation was common throughout the Clinch River valley, especially during the Woodland period (1000 B.C. – 1000 A.D.) and the Mississippian period (1000–1550 A.D.). A number of such habitation sites were excavated in the 1930s and 1950s in anticipation of the construction of Norris Dam and Melton Hill Dam, respectively. The Melton Hill excavations uncovered two substantial Woodland period villages along the Clinch at Bull Bluff and Freels Bend, both approximately downstream from Clinton.

By the time Euro-American explorers and longhunters arrived in the Clinch valley in the mid-18th century, what is now Anderson County was part of a vast stretch of land claimed by the Cherokee. Although the Treaty of Holston, signed in 1791, was intended as a negotiation with the Cherokee to prohibit Euro-American settlement of the area including what is today Anderson County, the treaty became ineffective as more settlers moved through the Appalachian Mountains from Virginia and North Carolina into Tennessee. The earliest settlers in Anderson County included the Wallace, Gibbs, Freels, Frost and Tunnell families. The flooding of white settlers into the Indian domain was cause for several skirmishes, which eased after the Treaty of Tellico in 1798 (including an origination point for the land to be relinquished from the Cherokee being the Tellico Blockhouse) allowed for greater ease in settling the area.

Founded in 1801, the town of Burrville was named in honor of Aaron Burr, first-term Vice President under Thomas Jefferson. Land was selected and partitioned for a courthouse, and Burrville was designated as the county seat for the newly formed Anderson County. The county was partitioned from portions of Grainger County and Knox County in 1801; neighboring Roane County was also formed from a portion of Knox County in 1801.

On November 8, 1809, by an act of the Tennessee State Legislature, the town of Burrville was renamed because of the disgrace of the Burr–Hamilton duel, which resulted in the death of Alexander Hamilton. The selection of the name &quot;Clinton&quot; was most likely to honor George Clinton or his nephew, DeWitt Clinton. George Clinton was one of Burr&#x27;s New York political rivals who, along with Alexander Hamilton, destroyed Burr&#x27;s bid for the governorship of New York after his single-term vice presidency. George Clinton succeeded Burr as the second-term vice president for Jefferson in 1805 (and also served as James Madison&#x27;s vice president, making Clinton the first vice president to serve under two presidents and the first vice president to die in office). Because of the political position of George Clinton as vice president at the time of Burrville&#x27;s name change, compared to DeWitt Clinton&#x27;s position as the mayor of New York City, most likely the residents of the town of Burrville would have been more readily identifiable and more honorable toward George Clinton than DeWitt; therefore, it is most likely Clinton was named after George Clinton, barring historical proof.

=== Growth &amp; Industry ===
With the construction of Clinton&#x27;s Southern Railway depot in the 1890s and the nearby booming coal industry, the population rose from about 325 in 1874 to 1,198 in 1890. During this time, the Southern Hotel accommodated overnight visitors arriving via passenger train until it burned down in 1908 in a fire that also affected most of Depot Street (now Market Street). Another Southern Railway depot was constructed in 1914 while coal mining continued to be a large enterprise for Anderson County.

Clinton&#x27;s first large manufacturing company, Magnet Knitting Mills, a textile mill for men&#x27;s socks, opened in 1906 with less than 60 workers. By 1910, the workforce grew to over 200 employees. In 1916, the mill employed over 500 workers, constructed an addition to its building, and started planning for the production of women&#x27;s silk hosiery.

Prior to the flooding cause by the Tennessee Valley Authority&#x27;s construction of the Melton Hill Dam, the Clinch River adjacent to Clinton was known for its freshwater pearl industry, however when river depths rose in the mid-20th century due to the dam, the warmer water temperature disrupted the mussels&#x27; habitat so that pearls were no longer harvestable.

===World War II===
The Clinton Engineer Works, named after Clinton, was the official name for the Manhattan Project site in Tennessee which produced the enriched uranium used in the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, as well as the first examples of reactor-produced plutonium. The site was also known by the name of its largest township, Oak Ridge. The works were located starting about southwest of Clinton, continued for towards Kingston and contained roughly .

===Clinton High School desegregation controversy===

In 1956, Clinton gained national attention when segregationists opposed the desegregation of Clinton High School. Following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, a court order required the desegregation of the high school. Twelve African-American students enrolled in the high school in the fall of 1956. On August 27, 1956, The Clinton 12 attended classes at Clinton High School for the first time, becoming the first African-Americans to desegregate a state-supported public school in the Southeast. 

While the first day of classes occurred without incident, pro-segregation forces led by John Kasper and Asa Carter arrived in Clinton the following week and rallied the city&#x27;s white citizens. Riots broke out in early September, forcing Governor Frank G. Clement to station National Guard units in Clinton throughout September. Sporadic violence and threats continued for the next two years, culminating in the bombing of Clinton High School on October 5, 1958. With an influx of outside aid, however, the school was quickly rebuilt. A museum dedicated to the desegregation crisis, the Green McAdoo Cultural Center, is housed in Clinton&#x27;s segregation-era Green McAdoo School. The Green McAdoo School served elementary school-aged black children, so until the desegregation movement, black high school-aged children were expected to travel to Knoxville for education. 

===Rogers Group quarry pushback===

In the 1990s, the Rogers Group, a firm specializing in road paving, began a campaign to reactivate an abandoned quarry and build an asphalt plant just east of Clinton near the community of Bethel. The initiative met with opposition from local and environmental groups, who were concerned that the plant would release cancer-causing toxins into nearby residential neighborhoods. Others were concerned about plummeting property values, noise pollution, damage from rock blasting, and environmental damage to Buffalo Creek. The company argued that it would follow stringent environmental and pollution guidelines, retention ponds would limit runoff, and that the site would be surrounded by vegetation. Nevertheless, Anderson County refused to rezone the quarry property for industrial uses, and Rogers Group sued the county in 1995.

In December 2006, after Rogers Group&#x27;s lawsuit had stagnated, the city of Clinton voted to annex the quarry property. On August 20, 2007, the Clinton City Council voted 6–1 to rezone the quarry property for industrial uses, paving the way for the plant&#x27;s construction. In response, a local advocacy group known as Citizens for Safety and Clean Air filed a lawsuit on behalf of several Bethel residents in Anderson County Chancery Court contending that the council&#x27;s rezoning was unconstitutional and seeking an injunction preventing the council from rezoning the property as an industrial zone.

===Modern day===

In 2018, urban developers and city officials met with the proposal to redevelop the downtown and waterfront area of Clinton after the Tennessee Department of Transportation began construction on a new bridge to carry US 25W-SR 9 across the Clinch River. The highlight of the project is the 7-acre site of the former Magnet Mills complex, having 1,400 feet of Clinch River frontage. Proposed additions to the site include improved commercial development and pedestrian access in the downtown area, and a waterfront esplanade and multi-story mixed-use buildings with upper-level residential space and ground level retail and restaurant space. 

Since 2018, an unknown developer based out of Knoxville has planned, under contract, the purchase of the Magnet Mills site along with a nearby plot of land with the intention of converting the area into a mix of residential and retail use. The City of Clinton has also applied for grants towards the improvement of the streets and sidewalks in the city&#x27;s downtown area, including the historical Depot Street (now Market Street). In July 2019, the remaining structures of Magnet Mills site, excluding the water tower, were demolished as the developer closed the sale on mill site. 

In early 2019, Aspire, a 370-acre multi-amenity park, was planned for development south of Clinton&#x27;s downtown area. The park was proposed by the local non-profit organization, the Hollingsworth Foundation, which owns land for the site along with the Tennessee Valley Authority. Construction work began in October 2019 and the park opened in October 2024. Aspire boasts a restaurant, The Pearl; an event venue, The Exchange; a boat and canoe/kayak put-in, The Launch; dog park; playground; mountain bike circuit; lawn, wildflower meadow, and shade gardens; 22 miles of hiking and biking trails; and a military monument.

==Geography==

Clinton is located at (36.104772, −84.128487), along the Clinch River, immediately downstream from a point where the southwestward-flowing river bends sharply to the northeast before wrapping around Lost Ridge and continuing again toward the southwest.

<text>Norris is a city in Anderson County, Tennessee. Its population was 1,599 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Knoxville, TN Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Norris was built as a model planned community by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in 1933 to house workers building Norris Dam on the Clinch River. It is named in honor of George W. Norris, a Senator from Nebraska, who was a long-term supporter of the TVA.

==History==

TVA chairman Arthur Morgan envisioned Norris as a model of cooperative, egalitarian living. The city design was developed by TVA staff, who loosely based their design on the English garden city movement of the 1890s. Winding roads followed the contour of the terrain. Houses did not always face the street. A central common green and a belt of rural land around the town were reserved for use by residents. The houses, which were some of the first all-electric homes, were built using local wood and stone, according to twelve basic house designs that each included a porch and fireplace. Different exterior materials were used for visual variety.

Norris represents the first use of greenbelt design principles in a self-contained town in the United States. The town was the first in Tennessee to have a complete system of dial telephones. Norris Creamery was the first milk-producing plant in the world to be powered solely by electricity.

During the 1930s, TVA officials excluded black families from the city, effectively making it a sundown town, purportedly to conform to the customs and traditions of the area. However, black leaders said that poor whites and blacks had lived and worked together in the area long before the TVA came into existence. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) complained repeatedly (in 1934, 1935 and 1938) about racial discrimination by the TVA in the hiring, housing and training of blacks.

In 1948 the U.S. Congress directed that the city be sold at public auction. It was purchased for $2.1 million ($ in dollars ) by a Philadelphia investment group headed by Henry D. Epstein, which then sold individual homes to their residents. The city was officially incorporated in 1949. In 1953 the Epstein group sold its remaining Norris real estate to a corporation formed by Norris residents and known as the Norris Corporation.

The town, including 340 buildings and an area of about , was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 as an historic district, designated the Norris District.

Today Norris primarily serves as a bedroom community for Knoxville and Oak Ridge. Services available within the community include one elementary school serving grades K-5, one middle school serving grades 6–8, a small grocer, and many other small businesses. The community&#x27;s high school students attend Anderson County High School.

The Museum of Appalachia, founded by John Rice Irwin, is a popular attraction in Norris. Norris is a short distance from Norris Dam State Park, part of which is in the city, and Big Ridge State Park, which include popular camping areas.

==Geography==

<text>Bell Buckle is a town in Bedford County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 410 at the 2020 census. The downtown area is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Bell Buckle Historic District.

==History==
The origin of the town&#x27;s unusual name is not known. According to the local chamber of commerce, one story says that one of the first white men to travel through the area found a tree with carvings of a cowbell and a buckle, possibly carved by Indians to warn white settlers away, or possibly carved by surveyors to mark the area as good pasture. Another form of the legend holds that a bell and buckle were tied around a tree. In any case, the nearby creek was named Bell Buckle Creek, and the town later took the name of the creek.

The Bell Buckle area was settled in the early 19th century. A bustling town grew up after the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad came through the area in 1852. A railroad depot was built in 1853, and the town was incorporated in 1856. Bell Buckle had its period of greatest prosperity after about 1870, becoming the major stockyard between Nashville and Chattanooga and growing to a population of more than 1,000.

The town name was spelled Belle Buckle until the early 1900s, as that was the spelling by the post office and on cancellation devices (1896), by the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway on its 1903 route map, and on the sign on an undated photo of the train station. It is not known exactly when the spelling was changed to Bell Buckle, but it was sometime before 1935 when Tennessee started issuing delayed birth certificates for residents who needed them to apply for Social Security.

In June 1940, US Army maneuvers centered on the area. A tank of General George S. Patton&#x27;s Second Armored Division ran into the two-story town hall, bringing the building down.
==Geography==

<text>Wartrace is a town in Bedford County, Tennessee. The population was 653 at the 2020 census. It is located northeast of Shelbyville. The downtown area is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Wartrace Historic District.

Wartrace is a hub of the Tennessee Walking Horse industry and has been nicknamed &quot;the cradle of the Tennessee Walking Horse&quot;. It is home to the Wartrace Horse Show, held annually since 1906, and the Tennessee Walking Horse National Museum has been headquartered in downtown Wartrace since 2012.

==History==
The name &quot;Wartrace&quot; is rooted in a Native American trail that once passed through the area. The town, initially known as &quot;Wartrace Depot,&quot; was established in the early 1850s as a stop on the newly constructed Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad.

During the Civil War, the town was the winter headquarters of Confederate General William J. Hardee during the aftermath of the Battle of Stones River, and the Old Chockley Tavern in Wartrace was a gathering place for Confederate officers during the Tullahoma Campaign. A skirmish was fought at Wartrace on April 11, 1862.

With the increase in rail travel in the late 19th century, Wartrace experienced a boom period. At its height, the town had six inns and hotels, and serviced 13 trains per day. One hotel, the Walking Horse Hotel, is still in business today. One of the local historic homes is also now operated as the Blue Victorian in Wartrace B&amp;B.

Wartrace is connected to Shelbyville by the Walking Horse and Eastern Railroad, a historic rail line that is still in part-time operation.

In the early 1900s, Wartrace served as a breeding center for the Tennessee Walking Horse, and the Wartrace Horse Show was founded in the town.

In 1972, Cascade K-5 opened as a result of the Bell Buckle School fire which displaced students within city limits of Bell Buckle, Tennessee, Shelbyville, Tennessee, and Wartrace. Cascade Middle &amp; High School have a varsity football team, drama club (The Black Curtain Players), marching band, men &amp; women&#x27;s soccer, softball, and baseball teams. In the fall of 2012, the Cascade High School Marching Band won the Division 1 TN Marching Band State Championship at Riverdale High School (Murfreesboro, Tennessee) under the direction of former drum major and Emory University alumna Sierra Cortner.
