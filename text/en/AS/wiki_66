<text>Campbelltown is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,616 at the 2010 census. It is located east of Hershey at the intersection of U.S. Route 322 and Pennsylvania Route 117 and is located in the Harrisburg metropolitan area.

==Geography==
Campbelltown is located in southwestern Lebanon County at (40.278200, -76.584149), in the northern part of South Londonderry Township. It is bordered to the west by Hershey in Dauphin County.

U.S. Route 322 passes through the center of Campbelltown, leading west through the southern part of Hershey to Harrisburg, the state capital. To the east US-322 leads to Ephrata in Lancaster County. PA-117 crosses US-322 on the eastern edge of Campbelltown; it leads north to Palmyra and southeast to Mount Gretna.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Campbelltown CDP has a total area of , all land. Spring Creek rises in the community and flows northwest to Swatara Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna River.
== History ==
The first European settlers to the Lebanon Valley area were namely Scotch-Irish and German Palatinate immigrants who left their homelands due to a number of political, economic and religious reasons. The Scotch-Irish in particular were also politically minded, and became involved in local governments quickly after settling in the area.

In 1751, a Scotch-Irish immigrant by the name of John Campbell came to Pennsylvania and settled in the area then known as Derry Township in Lancaster County. Campbell, who was a farmer, initially obtained a 100 acre warrant from Thomas and Richard Penn, proprietors of the Province of Pennsylvania in 1752 and sons of the famous William Penn. After returning his survey, which grew to 352 acres, he patented the property on August 6, 1759. Campbell then laid out various lots subject to the ground rent system, and the village of Campbelltown, then named &quot;Campbell&#x27;s Town&quot; was thus established.

After John Campbell&#x27;s death between 1775 and 1776, the land transferred to his brother Patrick who was from Cumberland County. Peter Grubb, Iron master of the Cornwall Furnace, purchased the same tract and ground rents in 1779, which was later sold to Robert Coleman along with many of Grubb&#x27;s other properties. Eventually, Philip Wolfersberger purchased the same 352 acres from Coleman in 1785, and in 1809, the Campbelltown tract was split into four parcels amongst his sons Peter, John, Frederick and Philip.

A branch of the U. S. Post Office was established in the village in about 1811 with Wolfersberger serving as the first postmaster.

Campbelltown&#x27;s government has always lied with the township. Originally part of Derry Township, Lancaster County, it became part of Londonderry Township, Lancaster County in 1768, and then Londonderry Township, Dauphin County in 1785. After the formation of Lebanon County in 1813, the village became part of Londonderry Township.

In 1894, Londonderry Township was divided into North and South, and Campbelltown became part of South Londonderry Township along with Colebrook and Lawn.

=== Education ===
Education in early Campbelltown was handled by the churches of the area until the enactment of the Free School Act in 1834 when public schools began to be established. Under the direction of the Londonderry Township School Board, the location closed during the 1972-73 school year. Since the merger of the Palmyra Area Joint School District (Palmyra Borough and North Londonderry Township) and the South Londonderry Township School District in 1962, education has been served by the Palmyra Area School District.
=== Transportation ===
Early Campbelltown served as a stop on the main trolley en route connecting Philadelphia and Harrisburg. The Downingtown, Ephrata and Harrisburg Pike, which was commonly known as the Horseshoe Pike, was chartered in 1803 and completed 1819, which later became part of US 322. Many people found themselves traveling through the village and staying at its few hotels.

Thanks to Milton S. Hershey, the arrival of public transportation in the form of a street railway in 1908 provided the citizens with the chance to travel beyond the boundaries of the village, including to the cities of Harrisburg, Lebanon, and beyond.

A few moments later, an F3 tornado with winds over struck the extreme southeast part of the village. No deaths occurred, but several minor to moderate injuries were treated. It is the largest and most expensive tornado to have struck Lebanon County.

On June 22, 2010, an EF0 tornado touched down in Campbelltown. This weak tornado did not cause as much damage as the one in 2004.

== Village Square Project ==
On October 23, 2023, Ethos Residential made public their plans to create a proposed village square project in the village of Campbelltown. Three properties along U.S. 322, formerly known as the Alger Farm, are envisioned for the new 15.15-acre mixed-use development.

The proposed architecture is loosely based on that used throughout historic Campbelltown and will be designed to function as a traditional town square.

==HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot;==
 was a World War II Royal Navy destroyer used in the St Nazaire Raid whose bell was donated to the municipality after the war.

In 1940, the Lend-Lease agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom was signed that gave 50 of the United States Navy destroyer in exchange for leases on British bases in the Western Hemisphere. One of these ships, USS &quot;Buchanan&quot;, launched in 1919, became HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot;. Its namesake was Campbeltown of Argyll County, Scotland, and its American counterpart, was Campbelltown of Lebanon County, Pennsylvania.

After the war, the bell resided in the Scottish Campbeltown until 1950, when British consul-general H. C. McClelland wrote a letter to the mayor of Lebanon announcing that the ship&#x27;s bell was being bequeathed to the city in recognition of a special bond between the town and the United Kingdom. The bell sits in the South Londonderry Township municipal building as a symbol of Campbelltown. In 1988 the people of Campbelltown voted to lend the bell to the new ship for as long as she remained in Royal Navy service. The bell was returned to the town on June 21, 2011 when HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot; was decommissioned. A new Type 31 HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot; was announced as part of the new Inspiration class of frigates for the Royal Navy on May 19, 2021.

<text>Cornwall is a borough in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the Lebanon, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 4,604 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Cornwall was initially settled by Peter Grubb in 1734. Peter was a Chester County stonemason who came to, what was then Lancaster County, in search of high quality stone for quarrying. First building his house and then a store, he discovered magnetite iron ore nearby and decided to test its quality, he found the ore to be exceedingly pure. Grubb wrote to Philadelphia and in 1734 was granted a warrant to purchase of land. For three years Peter followed veins of ore until he found a large deposit that was easily accessible; however, this ore was not within the bounds of his property. So in 1737 he purchased an additional of land. In 1742, Peter built a cold blast furnace and named it Cornwall, after his father&#x27;s birthplace in England. The Cornwall Iron Mine was, at one time, the largest open-pit mining operation in the world. They were mined continuously until June 30, 1973, totaling 236 years of production.

Finding the necessary components nearby for smelting iron (water, limestone and timber for charcoal), Grubb built the Cornwall Iron Furnace and began production in 1742. The operation also included the Hopewell Forges on nearby Hammer Creek. Peter Grubb did not stay long to run the operation, but leased it out in 1745 for 20 years and returned to Wilmington, Delaware. In 1765, Peter&#x27;s sons Curtis and Peter Jr. took over the operation, and in 1798 it passed to Robert Coleman and his family. Cornwall Furnace was in production from 1742 until 1883, and appears today much as it was when production ended. In 1932 the Coleman family deeded the property to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and it is now a designated National Historic Landmark open to the public.

Eventually the whole town became known as Cornwall. It was incorporated as a borough on October 11, 1926, after having been a part of Lancaster County and for a while of Dauphin County. At the time it officially became a borough, it comprised six widely separated villages.

Alden Villa was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

==History==

Indigenous nations in the area of what is now Lebanon included the Shawnee, Susquehannock, Gawanese, Lenape (or Delaware), and Nanticoke peoples.

Lebanon was settled by European colonists in 1720, many with the family names of &quot;Steitz&quot; and &quot;Light&quot;, along a creek that was then named &quot;Steitz Creek&quot;. The Light patriarchs built a fort to protect against Indians and named it &quot;Light&#x27;s Fort&quot;. The town was laid out in 1753, incorporated as a borough on February 20, 1821, and became a city on November 25, 1885. It adopted the commission form of government, consisting of four councilmen and a mayor.

Lebanon bologna was first made here, since before the 1780s. The Union Canal, which operated from 1828 to 1885, flowed through the city&#x27;s north side. San Giorgio pasta has been manufactured in Lebanon since 1914, and was acquired by nearby Hershey Foods Corporation in 1966.

==Culture==

Lebanon, Pennsylvania is thought to be named after the ancient Middle Eastern nation of Lebanon, however. Locals consistently pronounce the Pennsylvania city&#x27;s name (&quot;Leb-a-&quot;nin&quot;&quot;) and many shorten it to two syllables—&quot;Leb-nin&quot; or even &quot;Lep-nin.&quot; The latter is particularly identified with Pennsylvania Dutch heritage.

An infamous 1878 murder near Fort Indiantown Gap resulted in a trial of six defendants who all had blue eyes. They were given the moniker &quot;the Blue-eyed Six&quot; by a newspaper reporter who attended the trial, held in the Lebanon county courthouse. Five of the six defendants were hanged at the county jail. The trial received worldwide publicity and provided inspiration to Arthur Conan Doyle in writing the Sherlock Holmes short story &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; (1891).

At one point in history the Lebanon County courthouse and jail became the home of the popular Lebanon Farmers Market. After a time as a textile manufacturer, the market returned to the original 30,000 square foot Market House on South 8th street in 2003.

Lebanon is one of several Pennsylvania towns to drop or raise a unique item at midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Godshall&#x27;s Quality Meats, owners of Weaver&#x27;s Famous Lebanon Bologna, donates a Lebanon bologna for the annual festivity. It is encased in a metal frame and suspended from a fire department ladder truck, and donated to a local rescue mission after the celebration.

In December 2008, the TV show &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot;, hosted by Mike Rowe, visited the Seltzer&#x27;s Smokehouse Meats to film production of Lebanon bologna. In 2008 the show featured the Wertz Candy Shop.

In 2010, an independent film drama &quot;Lebanon, PA&quot; was made. The movie was set in Lebanon and some scenes were filmed in the city and surrounding county.

== History ==

The first European settlers were German-Swiss Protestants, particularly Lutherans, who began clearing and farming the land in the early 18th century. Even today, most residents can trace their ancestry to one or more of those early settlers. The native Indian population was quickly driven north into the Appalachian Mountains, although conflicts between natives and settlers were recorded as late as 1756. This area was originally part of Lebanon Township of Lancaster County, then Annville Township of Lebanon County. North Annville became a separate township in 1845, and its borders have remained unchanged since then, except for the southern edge, which was incorporated into the town of Annville in 1912. The main industry has always been farming. Many of the farms, dairy and livestock, have passed from generation to generation for more than a hundred years. The countryside is dotted with small residential communities, the largest of which are Bellegrove, Water Works, and Steelstown. Apart from a few family-owned businesses, the only major employer is a limestone quarry, which mines the high-calcium geological formation known as the Annville Belt.

<text>Palmyra (Pennsylvania German: &quot;Pallemschteddel&quot;) is a borough in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the Lebanon, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 7,807 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Palmyra is located at (40.307960, -76.593782).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all of it land.

Palmyra is located in the Lebanon Valley between Annville and Hershey. Situated on the western edge of Lebanon County, the borough is west of Lebanon, and east of Harrisburg. The village of Campbelltown is south of Palmyra and carries a Palmyra mailing address.

Although no water source runs directly through the borough, the Killinger, Quittapahilla, Spring, and Swatara Creeks are all nearby.

Palmyra has a humid continental climate.

==Geology==
Geologist William E. Kochanov wrote an extensive report on the geology of the Palmyra area as part of the 1995 publication, Karst Geohazards. In his article, Kochanov discusses how the geology of the region contributes to the high number of sinkholes found in the area.

Palmyra lies in the eastern section of the Great Valley, locally known as the Lebanon Valley. The specific formation beneath Palmyra is an Ordovician Epler Formation, characterized by a high number of surface depressions and sinkholes. These features serve as natural drains, allowing any water on the surface to permeate the soil and run underground into water tables or into local springs or creeks.

The development of the borough has interrupted the natural drainage systems present in the Epler Formation. Palmyra is, in reality, a waterless community. All of the natural drainage ways, including the Killinger, Quittapahilla, Spring and Swatara Creeks, lie outside the borough&#x27;s municipal borders. The storm water runoff is directed outside the borough via a multitude of ways, and it is these discharge areas in which the appearance of sinkholes is most prevalent. Residents and legislators met in October 1993 to discuss possible solutions to the recurring sinkhole problems. The installation of a storm sewer system was widely supported, but the estimated $10 million cost was a major hurdle. Since the meeting, several projects have been introduced to correct some of the water flow problems of the borough.

==History==

===Early settlement===
The land on which Palmyra rests was originally home to the Lenape and Susquehannock tribes. The first European explorers and traders came to the region around 1650. Settlers were drawn to the area because of its rich land and abundance of fish and game. Additionally, being part of William Penn’s colony, his charter providing civil rights and religious freedom also attracted settlers to the area.

In the beginning of its colonization, many of Pennsylvania’s settlers occupied the land not through acquiring the legal rights, but by building on any unclaimed land they found, or squatting. The squatters came to the Palmyra area between 1717 and 1740. Because the squatters had no official documents stating when they came to the land, it is difficult to precisely trace family migrations to and from the area. From looking at what records do exist, and by the people still living in the Palmyra area, it is clear that the first settlers to live near Palmyra came from two distinct nationalities, the Scotch-Irish and the German Palatinates.

The Scotch-Irish immigrants left their homelands due to a number of political, economic and religious reasons. As expected, they were clannish, and tended not to mix with the other ethnic groups settling the area at the same time. They were also politically minded, and became involved in local governments quickly after settling in the area. A majority of the Scotch-Irish were Presbyterian, and they established several churches as they moved westward across the state. Examples of the churches they built include Derry near Hershey, Donegal in Lancaster County, Paxtang near Harrisburg, and Silver Spring near Carlisle. As the years passed, many of the Scotch-Irish continued westward, leaving the Lebanon Valley.

Of the first Scotch-Irish settlers in the Palmyra area, the surnames of Aspey, Campbell, Caruthers, Ewing, Galbraith, McCallen, McClure, McCord, Mitchell, Sawyer, Walker and Wilson are recorded.

Grouped with the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch (for having originated in the historically disjunct German-/&quot;Dutch&quot;-speaking sphere), the German Palatinates had similarly left their homelands, and for a number of reasons. Politically they had been oppressed in the old country, and economically they were poor. They were also gravely persecuted for their religious beliefs. Like the Scotch-Irish, the Germans kept to themselves and did not interfere with settlers of other backgrounds. Throughout the parts of Pennsylvania that had already been settled, German was the prominently spoken language, surpassing English. This encouraged more German settlers to lay down roots in Pennsylvania more so than in the other colonies. Most of the German settlers were farmers, and they flourished in rural areas. These Germans saw farming as a way of life, and tended to be conservative, religious, frugal and hard working people. Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans were not politically minded, and they had no qualms with the English governing them. A majority of the Germans did not leave Pennsylvania, but stayed to work the rich soil.

Of the first German settlers in the Palmyra area, the surnames of Bindnagle, Bowman, Carmany, Deininger, Early, Forney, Gingrich, Hemperly, Hetrick, Kettering, Killinger, Naftzger, Nye, Ober, Ricker, and Zimmerman are recorded.

The Palmyra area, as well as the entire western edge of the European colonies, was susceptible to attack from the tribes of natives living in the region. In their histories of Lebanon County, Rupp and Egle note many raids that took place in what is now northern Lebanon County. In 1756, the Provincial government decided to build a chain of forts stretching from the Susquehanna River at Harrisburg in the west to the Delaware River at Easton in the east. These forts were built at regular intervals, roughly ten to apart, and in any major gaps along the mountains. One of these forts, Fort Swatara, was built by Capt. Frederick Smith near modern-day Inwood where the Swatara Creek flows through the Blue Mountain. By the end of the French and Indian War in 1763, the frequency and intensity of native attacks diminished.

Johannes Palm, whose name is often anglicized to John Palm, is given credit for founding Palmyra. He was a prominent figure in the early days of the community, serving as a doctor and soldier in the Revolutionary War. In June 1766, Palm secured the 100-acre plot of land originally surveyed for Johannes Deininger in 1951 and previously owned by Conrad Raisch. This plot was roughly bounded by the present-day Railroad Street, Maple Street and the Dauphin County line. By 1776, Palm had drawn up drafts for a settlement he called “Palmstown”, with his residence located on the 100-Block of West Main Street.

===Growth of Palmstown===

The settlement&#x27;s Post Office was established on April 1, 1804. The name of the town submitted to the Postal Service was “Palmstown”, in honor of Johannes Palm. Yet in 1806, there are records of a tract of land located on both sides of Main Street purchased by John Kean with the settlement being referred to as “Palmyra”, most likely referencing the Roman outpost of Palmyra in Syria. Although both names were used for a time, the popularity of “Palmyra” had spread and became the official name of the settlement by 1810.

Transportation from one settlement to the next was essential if either settlement wanted to grow. Turnpike companies were chartered to create improved roads to better facilitate the movement of goods from town to town. Governor Thomas McKean authorized the formation of the Berks and Dauphin Turnpike in 1805. This route was to connect Reading and Hummelstown and employed the main east-west thoroughfare through Palmyra. Upon its opening in 1817, Palmyra gained a direct connection to its neighbors Millerstown (now Annville) and Derry (now Hershey), and to the larger markets in eastern Pennsylvania. The Berks and Dauphin Turnpike existed as a toll road until 1917 and now forms part of US 422.

The Downingtown, Ephrata and Harrisburg Pike, which was commonly known as the Horseshoe Pike, was chartered in 1803 and completed 1819. This ran through Campbelltown just south of Palmyra and later became part of US 322. Another important route that crossed the Palmyra area included the road which led from the Bindnagle settlement to Campbelltown, which is now PA 117.

With the opening of these routes, and the incorporation of Harrisburg as the State Capital in 1812, more and more traffic moved through the Palmyra area. The passage of more travelers encouraged taverns and hotels to be built in Palmyra to accommodate them. In the first decades of the 19th century, Palmyra had five taverns and three hotels to serve the needs of those moving through the area. Blacksmith shops, general stores and other small business also began to pop up in Palmyra to serve both travelers and locals alike.

The demand of greater speed and tonnage of goods being moved prompted the building of the Union Canal. Completed in 1827, the Union Canal connected the Schuylkill River at Reading to the Susquehanna River at Middletown. The canal passed just north of Palmyra, and the settlement&#x27;s citizens benefited from the increased traffic. The canal was later widened to allow larger boats to pass through in 1849. The Age of Steam also came to Palmyra in 1857, as the first locomotives ran through the settlement on the Lebanon Valley Railroad in that year. The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, a predecessor of the Reading Company, acquired the Lebanon Valley Railroad in 1858. The growth of rail traffic signaled the end for the Union Canal, and for the Berks and Dauphin Turnpike as a toll road.

===Since the Civil War===
Palmyra continued to grow steadily through the 19th and 20th centuries. By 1845, the settlement consisted of 160 people in about 20 dwellings. By 1875, the population had increased to 500 people in about 100 dwellings. By 1890, the population had skyrocketed in just fifteen years to 1,760 people. And by 1960, the population had reached 7,000.

With the fall of Fort Sumter in 1861 to the Confederate Army, President Abraham Lincoln called on volunteers to preserve the Union. About 78 men from the Palmyra area answered the President&#x27;s call, and donned the blue uniforms of the Union.
After the Civil War concluded in 1865, a variety of new businesses were established to better serve the Palmyra area. A large grain warehouse, a slaughterhouse and lumber mill were some of the first industries developed in Palmyra. The town&#x27;s first newspaper was printed in 1878 and was titled “The Londonderry Gazette”. The Palmyra Bank opened in 1887. The first of several shoe factories opened in 1888. A knitting mill, paper box factory, gas and fuel company, bakery, bottling works, and a feed mill was also open in Palmyra around the start of the 20th century. The growth of Milton S. Hershey’s chocolate company in nearby Derry also encouraged people to move to the Palmyra area.
In 1899, the Lebanon Valley Street Railway Company was formed to provide transit across the length of Lebanon County. The trolley line reached Palmyra in 1904. By this time, the Hershey Trolley Company had also formed, and soon thereafter connected to the Lebanon Valley Line at the square in Palmyra. This trolley connection lasted until 1933, when the Lebanon Valley system switched to bus services. By 1946, the Hershey Line also folded.

The Landis Shoe Company Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.
===250th anniversary===
Palmyra celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2010. A committee was formed to plan the commemoration and among other duties, selected the official logo for the anniversary. The design, which is modeled on the Pennsylvania state seal and features the official orange and black colors of the Palmyra School District. Visit the official anniversary website to view an image of the winning logo.

==Culture==

===In popular culture===
The 2000 film &quot;Lucky Numbers&quot;, starring John Travolta and Lisa Kudrow, had multiple scenes shot throughout Palmyra. The main street of town was closed to traffic so that scenes could be shot. Dozens of onlookers watched Kudrow and Travolta cruise through the square in a red convertible.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 7,096 people, 3,200 households, and 1,952 families residing in the borough. The population density was . There were 3,363 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the borough was 96.72% White, 0.90% African American, 0.11% Native American, 0.92% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 0.34% from other races, and 1.00% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.20% of the population.

There were 3,200 households, out of which 25.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47.7% were married couples living together, 10.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 39.0% were non-families. 34.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.20 and the average family size was 2.83.

In the borough the population was spread out, with 22.2% under the age of 18, 8.0% from 18 to 24, 30.4% from 25 to 44, 21.4% from 45 to 64, and 18.0% who were 65 years of age or older.

About 3.9% of families and 5.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.2% of those under age 18 and 6.4% of those age 65 or over.

==Education==
The first two free public schools opened in Palmyra in 1840. Before this time, church schools and private schools served the children of Palmyra. In addition to the public schools, the Palmyra Academy, also known as the Witmer Academy after its founder, Peter B. Witmer, opened in 1857. The Palmyra Academy was praised as one of the best schools of its kind in the area. It prepared its students for continued education at colleges and universities, and educated students from all around the Susquehanna Valley and neighboring states. The Palmyra Academy closed its doors in 1890, and the Academy Building was torn down nine years later.

Coming with the growth of the area and the formation of a Borough Government, the Palmyra Borough School District was created in 1913. The first building for the district was erected on South Railroad St. on October 12, 1915. A new secondary school serving grades seven through twelve was built on W. Cherry St. in 1937. In 1952, the directors of the Borough of Palmyra and North Londonderry Township agreed to operate their schools cooperatively, and three years later merged to create the Palmyra Area School District. In 1962, the schools of South Londonderry Township joined the Palmyra Area School District.

Since its formation the district has served the Borough of Palmyra, and both North and South Londonderry Townships, including the villages of Campbelltown, Lawn, and Timber Hills. The Palmyra Area School District currently operates four elementary schools (Forge Road, Pine Street, Northside and Lingle Avenue), one middle school and one high school. All school buildings are located within the Borough of Palmyra, with the exceptions of the high school and Lingle Avenue Elementary, which are just south of the borough limits in North Londonderry Township.

It is the main town in Heidelberg Township. Although the exact date of the first settlers is unknown, it is certain that they settled here before 1725. Those first settlers were believed to have been German Jews though no physical evidence of their presence in the area that would become Schaefferstown exists. It is said twenty or so Jewish traders lived in the area in a place known as Lebanon Trading Post. An old Jewish burial ground is said to have been situated about a quarter mile south of Tower Hill and almost a hundred yards east of South Market Street in Schaefferstown. 

Brendle Farms, Philip Erpff House, and Rex House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Bomberger&#x27;s Distillery, also listed, was located near Schaefferstown. The buildings of the distillery were demolished. The Schaeffer House was added to the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark in 2011. Other historic buildings include the extravagant Second Empire style Weigley Mansion. Schaefferstown also hosts three museums: The Alexander Schaeffer House and Farm, Gemberling-Rex House and the Thomas R. Brendle Museum.

==Fountain Park==
The water company in Schaefferstown has the oldest gravitational conveyance system by underground pipes in the United States. The water system was constructed sometime between 1744 and 1750 by the founder of the town, Alexander Schaeffer. The water system, which is located in the area now known as Fountain Park, is still used by the townspeople for potable household water. When the original system was laid out, it ran to two wooden troughs on the Square, which is now the intersection of Main Street and Market Street. One trough was since replaced by Matilda Zimmerman in memory of Mary Rex Zimmerman, her mother and great granddaughter of Alexander Schaeffer. This trough is now located on the south face of the historic bank located within the Square.

==Fire/EMS protection==
Residents of Heidelberg Township are served by the Schaefferstown Volunteer Fire Co. and Schaefferstown EMS. Both the fire company and the EMS are volunteer only and rely on the donations from the people of Schaefferstown. The fire department has 24/7 coverage by four different pieces of apparatus: Rescue 35, Engine 35, Tanker 35, and Brush 35. The fire department has active fire police officers. Most of the fire police volunteers have certified training.

Schaefferstown EMS houses one ambulance (Ambulance 160) with 24/7 coverage. Schaefferstown EMS is a Basic Life Support (BLS) company, but is covered with Advanced Life Support (ALS) by First Aid and Safety Patrol of Lebanon, PA. Schaefferstown EMS also has volunteer ALS members. Schaefferstown EMS serves Heidelberg Township and portions of South Lebanon Township.

<doc id="132982" wikidata="Q142811" url="?curid=132982" title="Allentown, Pennsylvania">
<text>Allentown (Pennsylvania Dutch: &quot;Allenschteddel&quot;, &quot;Allenschtadt&quot;, or &quot;Ellsdaun&quot;) is the county seat of Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is the third-most populous city in Pennsylvania with a population of 125,845 as of the 2020 census and the most populous city in the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th-most populous metropolitan area in the nation as of 2020.

Founded in 1762, Allentown is located on the Lehigh River, a tributary of the Delaware River. It is the largest of three adjacent cities, including Bethlehem and Easton in Lehigh and Northampton counties, in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania. Allentown is located north of Philadelphia and west of New York City.

==History==
===18th century===
In the early 1700s, the area that is present-day Allentown was a wilderness of scrub oak, where the Lenape, an Indigenous tribe, fished for trout and hunted for deer, grouse, and other game. In 1736, this large area north of Philadelphia was deeded by 23 chiefs of the Five Civilized Tribes to three sons of William Penn, founder of the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania: John Penn, Thomas Penn, and Richard Penn. The price for the land included shoes, buckles, hats, shirts, knives, scissors, combs, needles, looking glasses, rum, and pipes.

On May 18, 1732, the land was deeded by Thomas Penn to Joseph Turner, an iron manufacturer and politician from Philadelphia. Two years later, on September 10, 1735, a part of the land was purchased from Turner&#x27;s business partner by William Allen, a wealthy shipping merchant who became mayor of Philadelphia a month later.

The land was surveyed in 1736 and again in 1753 as part of an effort to construct a road from Easton in the east to Reading in the west. The 1753 survey reported that a log house, owned by Allen and built around 1740, existed near the western banks of Jordan Creek. The house was used primarily as a hunting and fishing lodge by Allen, but he also used it to entertain prominent guests, including James Hamilton, his brother-in-law, and John Penn, then governor of the Province of Pennsylvania. In 1752, Northampton and Berks counties were formed; Easton was named the county seat of Northampton County, and Reading the county seat of Berks County.

In 1762, the land, including present-day Allentown, was named and laid out by Allen. A rivalry between the Penns and Allen may have inspired Allen to acquire the land and found the city. In 1763, a year after Allentown&#x27;s founding, an effort was made by Allen and others to move the county seat from Easton to Allentown, but the Penns&#x27; influence prevailed and the county seat remained in Easton.

The city&#x27;s original organization, whose archives are now housed at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, included 42 city blocks and 756 lots, most of which were in width and in depth. The city was initially located between present-day 4th and 10th streets and Union and Liberty streets and was initially named Northampton Towne.

Many streets on the original plan were named for Allen&#x27;s children, including Margaret (present-day 5th Street), William (now 6th Street), James (now 8th Street), Ann (now 9th Street), and John (now Walnut Street). Allen Street (now 7th Street), the city&#x27;s main street, was named for Allen himself. Hamilton Street was named for James Hamilton, deputy governor of colonial-era Pennsylvania from 1748 to 1754. Gordon Street was named for Patrick Gordon, an earlier deputy governor of colonial Pennsylvania. Chew Street was named for Benjamin Chew, and Turner Street was named for Allen&#x27;s business partner Joseph Turner.

Allen hoped that the city would displace Easton as the seat of Northampton County and become a major national center for commerce due to its location along the Lehigh River and its proximity to Philadelphia, which was then the nation&#x27;s largest and most influential city. In 1767, Allen granted the land to his son James.

====American Revolutionary War====

Allentown played a central role in both inspiring the American Revolution and supporting the subsequent Revolutionary War. Some of the first Patriot resistance to British colonialism in the Thirteen Colonies began in and around present-day Allentown. On December 21, 1774, a Committee of Observation was formed by Allentown-area patriots. Following the Declaration of Independence&#x27;s unanimous signing by the Second Continental Congress, British governing control in Allentown began to break down as patriot militias expanded their resistance. The patriot militias also pressured Tories out of the city, and expanded their ranks, which were ultimately incorporated into the Continental Army. The burden of supplying the local militias fell on the people, and requisitions for food, grain, cattle, horses, and cloth were common.

During the Revolutionary War, Hessian prisoners of war were kept in Allentown in the vicinity of present-day Seventh and Gordon streets. Allentown also housed four hospital structures, including one at Zion Reformed Church and one on the grounds of the present-day Farr Building, that were used in treating wounded Continental Army troops.

After crossing the Delaware and prevailing in the Battle of Trenton on December 26, 1776, Continental Army commander George Washington and his staff traveled through Allentown, where they proceeded up present-day Lehigh Street, then called Water Street. They stopped at the foot of the street at a large spring at the present-day Wire Mill. There, Washington and his troops rested and watered their horses, and then proceeded to their post of duty.

In 1777, a manufacturer of paper cartridges and muskets for the Continental Army relocated to Allentown from neighboring Bethlehem, and a shop of 16 armourers was established on Little Lehigh Creek, which was used to repair Continental Army weapons and manufacture saddles and scabbards for their use.

=====Liberty Bell&#x27;s hiding=====

Allentown holds historical significance as the location where the Liberty Bell, then known as the State House Bell, was successfully hidden for nine months by American patriots to avoid its capture by the British Army after the fall of Philadelphia during the Revolutionary War.

After George Washington&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Brandywine in Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania on September 11, 1777, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was left defenseless and American patriots began preparing for what they saw as an imminent British attack on the city. Pennsylvania&#x27;s Supreme Executive Council ordered that 11 bells, including the State House Bell, now known as the Liberty Bell, and ten other bells from Philadelphia&#x27;s Christ Church and St. Peter&#x27;s Church, be taken down and moved out of Philadelphia to protect them from the British Army, which would melt the bells down to cast into munitions. The bells were transported north to present-day Allentown by two farmers and wagon masters, John Snyder and Henry Bartholomew, and then hidden under floorboards in the basement of Zion Reformed Church at present-day 622 Hamilton Street in Center City Allentown, just prior to Philadelphia&#x27;s September 1777 fall to the British.

===19th century===
In 1803, the city, whose mail had previously been received in neighboring Bethlehem, had a post office established inside Compass and Square Hotel in the present-day Penn National Bank building at 645 Hamilton Street in Allentown. In the 1810 U.S. census, the city&#x27;s population exceeded 700 residents, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania granted Northampton Towne legal standing on March 18, 1811, incorporating it initially as the Borough of Northampton in what was then Northampton County. The new borough&#x27;s government first undertaking was ordering that cows in the city be moved from public streets to pastures, which proved unpopular with city residents. The following year, the city became part of Lehigh County, which was partitioned from a western section of Northampton County.

Throughout the early 1800s, the city grew primarily as a court and market town. Northampton Bank, the city&#x27;s first bank located at the northeast corner of Center Square, was chartered in July 1814, and the first Hamilton Street Bridge, a -long chain structure, was constructed over the Lehigh River. The bridge featured two suspended lanes, one for east and one for westbound traffic, and a toll house at the bridge&#x27;s western end. In 1829, Lehigh Canal, a -long canal on the Lehigh River&#x27;s east side, was completed for both ascending and descending navigation. Its construction was the most important factor in making anthracite coal, one of the nation&#x27;s most important domestic and industrial fuels, available to the nation&#x27;s largest industrial markets in New York City, Philadelphia, and elsewhere. In 1855, the first railroad was built on the Lehigh River&#x27;s west side, and rail soon began to surpass river transport as the means for transporting anthracite through the city.

In 1838, the city&#x27;s name was officially changed to Allentown. But it soon faced major challenges. In 1841, a flood swept away Hamilton Street Bridge and inflicted substantial damage on areas of the city near the Lehigh River. Two years later, in 1843, Northampton Bank failed following excessive speculation by the bank, resulting in financial ruin for many bank customers. Five years later, on June 1, 1848, a large fire burned down most of Allentown&#x27;s central business district between 7th and 8th streets on Hamilton Street.

During the 1850s, however, the city began recovering. A new bridge was built across the Lehigh River, and brick buildings were constructed to replace wooden ones that were burned in the 1848 fire. In 1852, the first Allentown Fair, now one of the nation&#x27;s longest continual annual fairs, was held.

====American Civil War====

On April 13, 1861, with tensions between the nation&#x27;s North and South intensifying following the South&#x27;s secession and the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, residents of Lehigh and Northampton counties called a public meeting in Easton to take steps to support the federal government. At the meeting, citizens voted to establish and equip the 1st Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, a new military unit, placing Captain Samuel Yohe of Easton and Thomas W. Lynn in charge and awarding them the respective ranks of colonel and major. Tilghman H. Good of South Whitehall Township, previously captain of the Allentown militia known as the Allen Rifles and commander of the 4th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, was placed in charge of the 1st Pennsylvania&#x27;s Company I, which included his former Allen Rifles subordinates and members of the Jordan Artillerist, another Allentown-based militia.

In April 1861, these Allentown units were deployed in response to President Lincoln&#x27;s call for 75,000 volunteers to defend the national capital in Washington, D.C., following the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter.

After the Civil War&#x27;s end, many of these soldiers were named Pennsylvania First Defenders in recognition of their role as one the first five units to answer Lincoln&#x27;s call for volunteers to defend the national capital. After protecting Washington, D.C., from April to July 1861, they were honorably discharged and returned home. However, a significant number of them reenlisted with the Union Army to defend the nation amidst the Civil War&#x27;s escalation.

=====47th Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry=====

On August 5, 1861, Andrew Gregg Curtin, Pennsylvania&#x27;s Civil War-era governor, granted Tilghman H. Good authority to create the 47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, a new unit commonly known as the 47th Pennsylvania Volunteers. Good secured help from William H. Gausler of Allentown, who was commissioned as a major with the regiment&#x27;s central command staff, and John Peter Shindel Gobin, a senior officer with the Sunbury Guards in Northumberland County, who was repeatedly cited for valor and was promoted to colonel and ultimately commanding officer of the regiment. Companies A and E of the regiment were recruited primarily from Easton and Northampton County; Companies B, G, I, and K were largely recruited from Allentown; Company C was recruited from Northumberland and Juniata counties; Company F was primarily composed of men from Catasaqua; and Companies D and H were recruited from Perry County. The 47th Pennsylvania Volunteers achieved Union victories at the Battle of St. Johns Bluff in Florida (October 1–3, 1862) before suffering a costly defeat in the Second Battle of Pocotaligo in South Carolina (October 21–23, 1862). They were the only Pennsylvania regiment to fight in the Union Army&#x27;s 1864 Red River campaign across Louisiana.

While sustaining numerous casualties during the Red River campaign in the spring of 1864, the 47th Pennsylvania helped turn the Civil War in the Union&#x27;s favor with victories in General Sheridan&#x27;s 1864 Shenandoah Valley campaign across Virginia, including in the Battles of Berryville, Opequan, Fisher&#x27;s Hill, and Cedar Creek and then again contributing to the defense of the nation&#x27;s capital following Lincoln&#x27;s assassination on April 15, 1865. Other known Union Army units from Allentown included the 5th, 41st, 128th, and 176th Pennsylvania Infantries.

On October 19, 1899, Allentown erected and dedicated the Soldiers and Sailors Monument at Hamilton and S. 7th streets in the Center City, where it still stands, in honor of these Union soldiers from Allentown and local Lehigh Valley towns and boroughs who were killed in defense of the Union&#x27;s preservation during the Civil War.

====Industrialization====


Beginning in the late 18th century, the city began to slowly grow as a hub for commerce and industrialization and as a colonial-era population center. Prior to the American Revolution, there were 54 homes in Northampton Towne and approximately 330 residents. In 1782, there were 59 houses and over 100 cows were stabled in the town. The town was described by a visitor in 1783, &quot;One gets a glimpse of many good stone houses, many of them very neat, and everything about the premises shows good order and attention. The people are mainly German who speak bad English and distressing German.&quot; In 1795, the &quot;U.S. Gazetteer&quot; described Allentown as: A handsome and flourishing town of Northampton County, pleasantly situated on the point of land formed by the junction of the Jordan Creek and Little Lehigh. It is regularly laid out and contains about ninety dwellings, a German Lutheran and a Calvinist (Zion) Church, an Academy and three merchant mills.

In 1792, land north of Allentown was purchased by Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company for coal mining, but it initially proved difficult to transport the region&#x27;s high quality anthracite coal over the primitive trail system that then existed, resulting in only a limited amount of anthracite being mined until 1818, when the company began constructing the Lehigh Canal to transport coal from Mauch Chunk, later renamed Jim Thorpe, down the Lehigh River to the river&#x27;s confluence with the Delaware River in Easton.

The opening of Lehigh Canal in 1818 quickly transformed Allentown and the surrounding Lehigh Valley from a rural agricultural area dominated by German-speaking people into one of America&#x27;s first urbanized industrialized areas and expanded the city&#x27;s commercial and industrial capacity. With this, Allentown underwent significant industrialization, ultimately becoming a major center for heavy industry and manufacturing.

Allentown&#x27;s industrial development accelerated in the late 18th century. David Deshler, Allentown&#x27;s first shopkeeper, opened a sawmill in the city in 1782. By 1814, industrial plants in Allentown included flour mills, sawmills, two saddle makers, a tannery and tan yard, a woolen mill, a card weaving plant, two gunsmiths, two tobacconists, two clockmakers, and two printers. In 1855, the first railroads to reach Allentown were opened, presenting the Lehigh Canal with direct competition for coal transport. Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad ordered four locomotives, and train stations were built in Allentown, Easton, and Mauch Chunk. In September 1855, the railroad became operational with the Central Railroad of New Jersey providing transport between Allentown and New York City. Transport between Allentown and Philadelphia was made available through Perkiomen Railroad, which operated between Norristown and Freemansburg.

In the 1840s, iron ore beds were discovered in hills around Allentown, and a furnace was constructed in 1846 by Allentown Iron Core Company for production of pig iron, a vital component used in the manufacturing of steel. The furnace opened in 1847 under supervision of Samuel Lewis, an expert in iron production, and was followed by the opening of other Allentown plants for production of a wide variety of metal products. In 1860, several smaller iron companies merged to create the Allentown Rolling Mill Company, which became Allentown&#x27;s largest iron company and contributed to the city and the greater Lehigh Valley region&#x27;s emergence as a major source for iron ore.

In 1850, Leh&#x27;s, a shoe and ready-to-wear clothing store, was opened in the city by Henry Leh. By 1861, with the Civil War commencing, Leh&#x27;s emerged as a major source of military boots for the Union Army. In addition to Leh&#x27;s, eight brick yards, a saw mill, a paint factory, two additional shoe factories, a piano factory, flour mills, breweries, and distilleries all opened in Allentown during the Civil War era.

In 1883, Allentown Boiler Works was founded in Allentown by Charles Collum. Collum and his partner John D. Knouse built a large facility at 3rd and Gordon streets in Allentown&#x27;s First Ward near the Lehigh Valley Railroad yard near what later became Kline&#x27;s Island. The company manufactured iron products, some of which were used in the construction of high-profile construction projects, including the building of the White House in Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. The company&#x27;s boilers and kilns were used for the production of iron products sold nationally and internationally, including to customers in Canada, Cuba, and the Philippines.

Brickworks flourished in Allentown through the end of World War I. The clay unearthed in various sections of Allentown and the city&#x27;s suburbs proved suitable in manufacturing building brick and fire brick. Bricks were the first Allentown products shipped by rail and sold nationally. A vibrant food processing industry began emerging in Allentown following the arrival of predominantly German immigrant bakers, who were among Allentown&#x27;s first settlers. In 1887, Wilson Arbogast and Morris C. Bastian formed Arbogast and Bastian, which provided large scale commercial slaughtering.

With industrialization, Allentown emerged as a major regional and national center for banking and finance. In 1860, William H. Ainey founded Allentown Savings and served as its first president. In 1864, Second National Bank of Allentown was formed, and Ainey was elected its first president, a position he held until his death. Ainey contributed to Allentown&#x27;s industrial and retail growth, helping finance Iowa Barb Wire Company, which was later absorbed by American Steel &amp; Wire, Pioneer Silk Factory, Palace Silk Mill, and Allentown Spinning Company.

In the late 1870s, Allentown&#x27;s iron industry collapsed, leaving the city economically depressed. Efforts were made to diversify the city&#x27;s industrial base, including convincing Phoenix Manufacturing Company to open a silk mill in Allentown. Adelaide Mill at Race and Court streets prompted the opening of Pioneer Silk Mill in 1886, and the city quickly emerged as a national leader in silk manufacturing. The silk industry grew to ultimately become Allentown&#x27;s largest industry in the late 19th century and remained the city&#x27;s largest industry through the end of the 20th century. In 1914, there were 26 silk mills in the city. By 1928, after the introduction of rayon, the number of Allentown silk mills grew to 85, and over 10,000 people were employed in the Allentown silk industry at the industry&#x27;s height in the 1940s.

In 1896, Max Hess, a retailer from Perth Amboy, New Jersey, visited Allentown and set about developing Allentown&#x27;s first department store. He and his brother Charles opened Hess Brothers at 9th and Hamilton streets. Hess&#x27;s developed a reputation for flamboyance, offering the latest European fashion apparel. The opening of Hess&#x27;s was following by the opening of a second major department store in the city, the Zollinger-Harned Company, located in the Zollinger-Harned Company Building on Hamilton Street.

In the late 19th century, Allentown also emerged as a major center for the beer brewing industry. Notable Allentown breweries included Horlacher Brewery (founded 1897, closed 1978), Neuweiler Brewery (founded 1875, closed 1968), and Schaefer Beer, whose brewery was later acquired by Pabst and Guinness and is now owned by Boston Beer Company, brewer of Samuel Adams beer.

===20th century===
In 1905, Jack and Gus Mack moved Mack Trucks, their motor company, from Brooklyn to Allentown, taking over the foundries of Weaver-Hirsh on South 10th Street. By 1914, Mack Trucks developed a global reputation for manufacturing sturdy and reliable trucks and vehicles. Many were sent to Western Front battlefields in France prior to the U.S. formally entering World War I in 1917. The British nicknamed Mack AC&#x27;s five and seven-ton trucks the &quot;Bulldog&quot;. Mack eventually grew to have eight manufacturing plants in Allentown and adopted the bulldog as its corporate brand.

Beginning in the early 20th century, Syrian Christians from the region of Wadi al-Nasara (&#x27;the Christian Valley&#x27;) began settling in Allentown, initially the result of missionary activity in their villages by Pennsylvanian missionaries. The Syrian community eventually became a significant component of the city, largely concentrated in Allentown&#x27;s Sixth Ward. There were an estimated 5,200 Americans of Syrian descent in Allentown and the Lehigh Valley in 2015. 

Like several other regions in Pennsylvania, Allentown residents continued speaking Pennsylvania German well into the early 20th century. Pennsylvania Guide, compiled by the Writers&#x27; Project of the Works Progress Administration, described the Pennsylvania Dutch community&#x27;s impact on Allentown&#x27;s linguistic landscape, reporting in 1940 that:

In October 1945, following the end of World War II, Western Electric opened a plant on Union Boulevard in Allentown. Six years later, on October 1, 1951, the company manufactured and released the world&#x27;s first transistor, which was produced at the Allentown-based plant, and the Allentown-based company emerged as a leader in the nation&#x27;s post-war electronics revolution.

By the mid-20th century, Allentown was a major retailing and entertainment center distinct and separate from Philadelphia and New York City. Hess&#x27;s, Leh&#x27;s, and Zollinger department stores led to retail sector growth in Allentown, and dozens of smaller retail stores, restaurants, hotels, banks, and professional offices in the city emerged in present-day Center City, which was then referred to as downtown Allentown. At least seven cinemas and stage theaters were developed on Hamilton Street between 5th and 10th streets.

====Deindustrialization and Rust Belt====

By the mid-1960s, Allentown&#x27;s economy had been booming for decades but the city&#x27;s rising taxes and regulations prohibiting expansion of the city&#x27;s geographic limits began leading many of the city&#x27;s residents, especially those in the post-World War II baby boom generation, to flee Allentown for its suburbs. Salisbury, South Whitehall, and Whitehall townships each had large areas of farmland that were prime locations for residential real estate development. Much of Allentown&#x27;s working class began migrating to these newer, less-expensive housing developments in Allentown&#x27;s suburbs, which offered lower taxes, more green space, less crime, and newer schools.

This demographic trend continued throughout the latter part of the 20th century, presenting a major challenge to Allentown&#x27;s city government and the Allentown School District as it confronted greatly diminished resources. Allentown School District&#x27;s financial challenges, in turn, further increased the working class flight to Allentown&#x27;s suburbs, creating a sea change in the city&#x27;s demographics. With the departure of many working-class families from older Center City neighborhoods, many homes were sold to landlords who converted them into inexpensive multifamily apartments, many of which became government-subsidized housing projects that were permitted under the city&#x27;s lax zoning and city codes.

With Allentown&#x27;s neighborhoods and school system declining, the city focused on attempting to develop its Hamilton Street retail district, largely ignoring Allentown neighborhoods not located in Center City. This also exacerbated the flight of Allentown families to the city&#x27;s suburbs, leading to the development of shopping centers and services to accommodate the demand in these expanding suburban communities. In 1966, Whitehall Mall, the first closed shopping mall north of Philadelphia, opened in Whitehall Township.

Ten years later, in 1976, the even larger Lehigh Valley Mall opened north of U.S. Route 22 in Fullerton. Stores in Allentown&#x27;s downtown shopping district began closing, replaced with stores whose customers were less affluent. Large areas of Allentown&#x27;s downtown were subsequently razed and replaced with parking lots. The downtown business district was rebuilt in an attempt to compete with the newer suburban shopping locations. A multiblock row of stores known as Hamilton Mall was developed, featuring newly covered sidewalks and managed traffic patterns. But the effort was unsuccessful, and two of the city&#x27;s major department stores, Leh&#x27;s and Zollingers, were forced to close by 1990. The third, Hess&#x27;s, was sold to The Bon-Ton in 1994, which closed its Hamilton Mall location two years later in 1996. In 1993, the Corporate Center, the city&#x27;s new flagship business center on North 7th Street, fell victim to a large sinkhole, which led to its condemnation and ultimate demolition.

===21st century===

Combined with challenges confronting Center City, the manufacturing economy of the Northeastern United States began suffering from deindustrialization associated with foreign competition, trade policies, and manufacturing costs. Many Allentown factories and corporations began closing or relocating.

Responding to the late 20th century economic downturn, Allentown consciously sought to begin diversifying its economy in the early 21st century. In the 2000s and 2010s, Allentown&#x27;s economy saw growth in its service, health care, transportation, warehousing, and some manufacturing industries. In 2009, the Neighborhood Improvement Zone (NIZ), created by the Pennsylvania State Legislature, sought to address Allentown&#x27;s economic challenges and encourage its development and revitalization. The NIZ includes approximately in Center City and the city&#x27;s riverfront district on the Lehigh River&#x27;s western side.

In 2006, Agere Systems, formerly Western Electric, was acquired by LSI Corporation and relocated to San Jose, California. Mack Trucks relocated to Greensboro, North Carolina, in 2009, and other Allentown-based factories downsized considerably or ceased operations entirely. With the city&#x27;s manufacturing base eroded, once high-paying industrial jobs were replaced with lower-paying service sector jobs, and Allentown began being cited widely as one of the most prominent examples of a late 20th century Rust Belt city.

In 2014, Center City underwent major restructuring, including constructing and opening PPL Center, a 10,500-capacity indoor arena that now hosts the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, a professional American Hockey League ice hockey team, and other sports, entertainment, and concert events. A full-service Renaissance Hotel also opened, and older office buildings were redeveloped.

In 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Allentown as one of the &quot;150 Best Places to Live in the U.S.&quot; and the fifth-best city in the nation to retire.

==Geography==

===Topography===

Allentown&#x27;s geographic boundaries include a total area of . Of this, is land and is water, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Bodies of water include Jordan Creek and its tributary, Little Lehigh Creek, which join within the city limits and empty into the Lehigh River. Other bodies of water in Allentown include Lake Muhlenberg in Cedar Creek Parkway and a pond in Trexler Park.

====Adjacent counties====
Allentown is located in the Lehigh Valley, an eastern Pennsylvania geographic valley located between two Appalachian mountain ridges, Blue Mountain, which varies from to in height about north of the city, and South Mountain, a ridge of to in height that borders Allentown&#x27;s southern edge. It includes both Lehigh and Northampton counties.

The Lehigh Valley&#x27;s adjacent counties include Carbon and Monroe counties to its north, Bucks County to its southeast, Montgomery County to its south, Berks and Schuylkill counties to its west, and Warren County, New Jersey to its east.

===Cityscape and neighborhoods===

Center City, which includes the downtown area and its 7th Street retail and residential corridor, is the city&#x27;s central business district and the location of most of its city, county, and federal government buildings. To the east of Center City are The Wards, residential areas developed during Allentown&#x27;s late 19th century and early 20th century industrial boom. Just east of the Lehigh River are the city&#x27;s East Side residential neighborhoods, most of which border various routes to neighboring Bethlehem. South of Center City and across Little Lehigh Creek are the city&#x27;s South Side neighborhoods, which border Emmaus. Allentown&#x27;s West End, with a mix of commercial corridors, cultural centers, and larger single-family residences, begins approximately west of 15th Street.

Center City&#x27;s tallest building is the PPL Building at . In addition to the PPL Building, Center City commercial office buildings include the Dime Savings and Trust Company building, which features the Art Deco architecture of the region during the 1920s and 1930s. One City Center, Two City Center, and other commercial buildings are located in Center City.

An 8,500-seat indoor arena, PPL Center, which hosts the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the American Hockey League, opened in August 2014 at 701 Hamilton Street in Center City. Other Center City historic and recreational landmarks include Allentown Art Museum, Baum School of Art, Lehigh County Historical Society, and Miller Symphony Hall.

In January 2015, two major hotels, Americus Hotel and a Marriott, opened in Center City.

==== Architecture ====

Allentown is characterized by a large stock of historic homes, commercial structures, and century-old industrial buildings reflecting its standing as one of the nation&#x27;s earliest urban centers. Center City&#x27;s neighborhoods include Victorian and terraced rowhouses. West Park includes mostly Victorian and American Craftsman-style architecture. Houses on Allentown&#x27;s tree-lined streets in the West End were built mostly between the 1920s and 1940s. Houses in Allentown&#x27;s East and South Sides are a mixture of architectural styles and are generally single and twin family homes built between the 1940s and 1960s; both areas include some older Victorian homes. Allentown has many loft apartments in converted mills and historic brick manufacturing buildings and modern and historic high-rise apartment buildings in Center City.

Allentown has three primary historic districts: Old Allentown, the Old Fairgrounds, and West Park. Old Allentown and Old Fairgrounds are Center City neighborhoods that hold a joint house tour organized by the Old Allentown Preservation Association (OAPA) annually in September. West Park also offers a tour of its Victorian and Craftsman-style homes.

The PPL Building, at 2 North 9th Street, is Allentown&#x27;s tallest building at . The building was designed by New York City architectural firm Helme, Corbett, and Harrison. Wallace Harrison was the primary designer of the building, which later served as a prototype for the Art Deco architecture of Rockefeller Center and other New York City building structures. Built between 1926 and 1928, the PPL Building&#x27;s exterior decorative friezes were designed by Alexander Archipenko. The building, which opened July 16, 1928, has been illuminated every night since its opening. In clear weather at night, the PPL Building&#x27;s nighttime illumination can be seen from as far north as the Blue Mountain Ski Area in Palmerton. The building&#x27;s exterior is featured in multiple scenes in the 1954 movie &quot;Executive Suite&quot;.

Miller Symphony Hall at 23 North 6th Street opened in 1896 and served initially as the city&#x27;s public market; the 1,100 seat facility is now home to the Allentown Symphony Orchestra. The structure was converted to a theater in 1899 by architect J. B. McElfatrick&#x27;s firm, and was initially named the Lyric Theater. Miller Symphony Hall, one of roughly a dozen famous McElfatrick designs still standing in the nation, has been used for burlesque shows, vaudeville, silent films, symphony orchestras, and other entertainment for over a century. Other Allentown-based performing arts facilities and programs include Pennsylvania Sinfonia, Community Concerts of Allentown, Allentown Band, and Community Music School of the Lehigh Valley.

==Economy==

Allentown historically was a hub for the nation&#x27;s earliest industrialization and its economy was heavily manufacturing-based. Beginning in the late 20th century, the city evolved into a more service-oriented economy due to Rust Belt decline in heavy industry that commenced around 1980 and accelerated through the 20th century&#x27;s last two decades. Allentown is corporate headquarters for several large companies, including Air Products, PPL Corporation, and others. The largest employer in Allentown, as of 2007, is Lehigh Valley Health Network with over 7,800 employees. Lehigh Valley Health Network&#x27;s flagship hospital, Lehigh Valley Hospital–Cedar Crest, is Pennsylvania&#x27;s third-largest hospital with 877 licensed beds and 46 operating rooms.

Center City, located largely on Hamilton Street between 5th and 10th streets, was the primary shopping district in Allentown for most of the 20th century. During the 1960s and 1970s, however, several shopping malls, including South Mall in Salisbury Township and Lehigh Valley Mall and Whitehall Mall, both in Whitehall Township, were built in Allentown&#x27;s suburbs and today represent the most popular shopping destinations. In October 2006, The Promenade Shops at Saucon Valley opened south of Allentown in Upper Saucon Township.

==Culture==

===Arts and theater===
Allentown Symphony Orchestra performs at Miller Symphony Hall, located on North 6th Street in Center City. The city has a musical heritage of civilian concert bands and is home to the Allentown Band, the nation&#x27;s oldest civilian concert band.
Allentown houses a collection of public sculptures, including the DaVinci Horse, located on 5th Street, which is one of only three da Vinci sculptures in the world. Allentown Art Museum, located on North 5th Street in Center City, is home to a collection of over 13,000 pieces of art and an associated library. Baum School of Art at 5th and Linden streets offers credit and non-credit classes in painting, drawing, ceramics, fashion design, jewelry making, and other arts-related curriculum.

Foodstuffs, including scrapple, chow-chow, Lebanon bologna, cole slaw, and apple butter, are often found in local diners and the Allentown Farmer&#x27;s Market. Shoofly pie, birch beer, and funnel cakes are regularly available at local fairs. Several local churches make and sell fastnachts in fundraisers for Fastnacht Day, the day before Lent&#x27;s commencement.

==History==
===18th century===
George Taylor, signer of the Declaration of Independence, built a Georgian stone house in 1768 in what is now Catasauqua. The George Taylor House has been named a National Historic Landmark, a showpiece of the community&#x27;s rich historical heritage. At the time, the area of present-day Catasaqua was referred to as Biery&#x27;s Port.

===19th century===
In 1840, the anthracite iron industry was found in Biery&#x27;s Port in present-day Catasaqua, making Catasaqua a birthplace of the American Industrial Revolution.
Welsh immigrant David Thomas relocated to the area and opened the Crane Iron Works. The Catasauqua and Fogelsville Railroad existed to transport ore from limonite deposits to the plant. Remembered as &quot;the father of Catasauqua,&quot; Thomas initially named the community Craneville after his former employer in Wales. The wealthy, generous Thomases were responsible for many sweeping changes to the prosperity of the community. David Thomas founded the Presbyterian Church of Catasauqua, in which residents still worship today, and his wife Elizabeth donated money and land to found the Welsh Congregational Church, which no longer exists. Thomas organized Catasauqua&#x27;s first fire company, installed its first public water system, and served as its first burgess.

In 1854, the town was formally titled Catasauqua (pronounced &quot;Cat-uh-SAW-kwuh&quot;), derived from the Lenape language, and meaning &quot;dry ground&quot; or &quot;thirsty ground.&quot; By 1900, Catasauqua boasted 5,000 residents, and had the highest percentage of self-made millionaires of any town in the United States.

===20th century===
In 1917, while many of the young men of the town served in World War I, Catasauqua became the first community in the United States to raise $1 million in war bonds, earning it the nickname &quot;The Million Dollar Town&quot;.

===21st century===
Catasauqua observed its 150th anniversary of incorporation in 2004. In July 2014, the town also celebrated its 100th anniversary of the old home week celebration in 1914. The original old home week marked the 75th anniversary of the town&#x27;s Lehigh Crane Iron Company.

Catasauqua is home to two different neighborhoods listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Biery&#x27;s Port, located along the Lehigh River and named for an early family of prominence, and a neighborhood known as &quot;the mansion district,&quot; which includes Victorian homes once owned by wealthy Catasauqua residents.

==Education==

==History==
Coplay was part of the of land John Jacob Schreiber bought from the William Penn&#x27;s heirs in 1740. It was initially known as Schreibers and later was known as the Lehigh Valley, because of Lehigh Valley Iron Furnaces were located here. Lehigh Valley was then changed to Coplay, derived from &quot;Kolapechka&quot;, the son of the Indian chief Paxanosa, who lived at the head of the creek near Schnecksville. Coplay seceded from Whitehall Township in 1869 and was incorporated as a borough on April 7, 1869.

Coplay gradually changed from a farming area into an industrial community, starting with the founding of the Thomas Iron Company, which attracted laborers and built homes for them. When the Iron Company was liquidated, other industries gradually came to Coplay, including the Cement Mill, the Silk Mill, the Cigar Factory, and Knitting Mill. Coplay became a melting pot of many nationalities. The Pennsylvania Dutch and Germans were initially drawn to the area for its agricultural promise. The growth of the iron industry attracted immigrants from Ireland. Then, in the early 1900s, the Cement Mills attracted immigrants from Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Ukraine.

On April 7, 1969, the borough celebrated its centennial anniversary. A celebration was held from June 15–21 in the town. In 1980, in recognition of historical value, Coplay Cement Company Kilns was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="132987" wikidata="Q680643" url="?curid=132987" title="Emmaus, Pennsylvania">
<text>Emmaus ( ) is a borough in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 U.S. census, it had a population of 11,652. Emmaus is located in the Lehigh Valley, the third-largest metropolitan area in Pennsylvania and 68th-largest metropolitan area in the nation.

In 2007 and again in 2009, Emmaus was listed as one of the top 100 &quot;Best Places to Live&quot; in the United States by &quot;Money&quot; magazine.

Emmaus is located south of Allentown, north of Philadelphia, and west of New York City.

==History==
===18th century===
Emmaus was settled in the early 1700s during the colonial era by German Protestants of the Lutheran and Reformed faiths who were fleeing religious persecution in Europe. Its earliest German settlers were primarily farmers. 

In 1741, the land on which present-day Emmaus is located was donated to the Moravian Church by Sebastian Heinrich Knauss and Jacob Ehrenhardt for the purpose of creating a closed faith-based village. The village was originally named Salzburg. At the time of its founding in 1759, Emmaus was one of four leading Moravian communities in the Thirteen Colonies; Bethlehem, Lititz, and Nazareth, each in Pennsylvania, were the three others.

Two years later, in 1761, Moravian Bishop August Gottlieb Spangenberg announced the town&#x27;s new name would be Emmaus, saying &quot;Now here we build a village small; toward its completion we give all. Here, too, our hearts within shall flame; Emmaus then shall be its name.&quot; For approximately 100 years, until the mid-19th century, Emmaus was a closed community of the Moravian Church. Emmaus was named for the Biblical village of Emmaus, where, according to the Bible&#x27;s Gospel of Luke, Jesus was seen by his disciples Luke and Cleopas in what is known as his Road to Emmaus appearance following his crucifixion and resurrection.

Three historic Emmaus residential structures built during the 18th and early 19th centuries, each still standing, have been added to the National Register of Historic Places. Shelter House, constructed in 1734 by Pennsylvania Dutch settlers, is the oldest building structure in Emmaus and the oldest continuously occupied structure in the Lehigh Valley. The 1803 House was built in 1803 in Emmaus by Revolutionary patriot militia member Jacob Ehrenhardt, Jr., son of one of the founders of Emmaus. Kemmerer House, built between 1840 and 1950, is a farmstead house in Emmaus.

===19th century===
From its founding in 1759 until 1830, the settlement&#x27;s name was spelled &quot;Emmaus.&quot; From 1830 until 1938, however, the community used the Pennsylvania Dutch spelling of the name, &quot;Emaus,&quot; with a macron line above the &quot;m&quot; to indicate a double letter. As English began emerging as the prevalent language in Pennsylvania, however, the line often was often omitted, leading to confusion about the correct spelling. In 1938, the local Rotary Club circulated petitions in support of changing the spelling to &quot;Emmaus,&quot; and its spelling was changed to match the English version of the Bible&#x27;s King James Version. Despite the 1938 spelling change, a major borough thoroughfare, Emaus Avenue, continues to retain the pre-1938 spelling.

Emmaus and the metropolitan Allentown area contributed considerable numbers of volunteers to the Union Army during the American Civil War. Volunteers from the region comprised roughly 70 percent of the 47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, which mobilized after the fall of Fort Sumter to Confederate forces in April 1861, and engaged Confederate forces in the Lower seaboard theater in 
southern states through the Civil War&#x27;s conclusion. On June 7, 1930, in recognition of the 47th Regiment&#x27;s contributions to the preservation of the Union and Emmaus veterans who later served in the Spanish-American War and World War II, Emmaus erected the Emaus Honor Roll, using the borough&#x27;s initial spelling, in a mini-park between 3rd and 4th Streets in their honor.

Iron ore was discovered in and near Emmaus in the 19th century. Beginning in 1850, the Donaldson Iron Company in Emmaus mined and processed iron ore and manufactured cast iron pipes and other iron-related products. In 1859, Reading Company constructed railroad lines through Emmaus, which are still functioning. The same year, the town was incorporated as a borough. In 1869, the town&#x27;s first blast furnace opened. Iron ore production fueled the town&#x27;s growth through the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century. During the 19th century, Emmaus was also a center of silk and cigar manufacturing.

===20th and 21st centuries===
In 1940, public census statistics showed that 6,731 people lived in Emmaus. The population of the borough has since nearly doubled to 11,467 as of the 2020 census. Housing construction has reached the borough line in all directions so significant continued population growth in the borough is unlikely. Outside the borough line, however, the local population continues to grow, especially in neighboring Lower Macungie Township. Consequently, growth in the Emmaus ZIP Code continues to expand but not within its borough limits.

<doc id="132988" wikidata="Q1132267" url="?curid=132988" title="Fountain Hill, Pennsylvania">
<text>Fountain Hill is a borough in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population of Fountain Hill was 4,832 at the 2020 census, an increase over the figure of 4,597 tabulated in 2010. It is part of the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th-most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. as of the 2020 census.

==History==
The region which would become Fountain Hill was home to Lenape Indians prior to its acquisition by William Penn for his sons, Thomas, John and Richard in 1681. The Penns would hire a pioneer, Nicholas Doll, to settle the land, building the first structure there in 1739. The deed for the land was passed to several farming families before being sold to the Moravians in the recently established Bethlehem in 1743.

The Moravians would directly own the area which would become Fountain Hill for 32 years, and for 100 years after the purchase the area consisted of non-Moarvian tenant farmer, the largest of which was a 147-acre farm owned by the Hoffert family. The farm house was built in 1755 by Cornelius Weygandt and remains the oldest standing structure in the borough.

In 1846 the Moravians sold 2-acres of the property to Dr. Francis Henry Oppelt who opened a hotel and mineral spa on the site. Oppelt was a staunch believer in balneotherapy, and believed the mineral waters could cure diseases and other ailments. Oppelt&#x27;s facility would remain open for 25 years from 1846 until 1871.

Oppelt eventually went bankrupt with his resort being sold in a Sheriff Sale to one Tinsley Jeter, who in turn sold it to Asa Packer, founder of Lehigh University in nearby Bethlehem, in 1876. Packer promptly gifted the land to St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital who moved their hospital from South Bethlehem to the now vacant resort.

In 1848 the Hoffert farm was sold to real estate developers who turned it into a massive mansion named the &quot;Fontainebleau Estate&quot; which would trade ownership several times before 1866 when the estate would also be purchased by Tinsley Jeter who laid a town plot on the property. Jeter at the time was purchasing most of the farms in the region, as well as the mansions built for Lehigh Valley Railroad executives, many of which are preserved in the Fountain Hill Historic District.

In 1866 Jeter was choosing a name for the property and settled on &quot;Fountain Hill&quot;, due to the earlier Fontainebleau estate, which stood on a small hill. In 1886 the growing town became the home to several Silk Mills with the birth of the Industrial Revolution.

With the advent of local industry, the regions population surged, however, there was still no incorporated government, with the region operating as a village within Salisbury Township. After a successful petition to the Lehigh County government, Fountain Hill became an incorporated municipality on November 13, 1893.

In 1905 the residents of Fountain Hill rejected a proposal to join the municipality of South Bethlehem (annexed by Bethlehem in 1917) to form an Independent city. In 1919 Fountain Hill annexed some portions of neighboring Salisbury township, and around this time, Fountain Hills most famous resident, Stephen Vincent Benét, began his literary career, publishing his famed poem &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; in 1929. Through the 1940s Fountain Hill would remain a cultural retreat for Bethlehemites, hosting many operas, playhouses, and theaters. In 1949 Fountain Hill annexed another parcel from Salisbury township, bringing the borough to its present borders.

<text>The Royal Proclamation of 1763 was issued by British King George III on 7 October 1763. It followed the Treaty of Paris (1763), which formally ended the Seven Years&#x27; War and transferred French territory in North America to Great Britain. The Proclamation at least temporarily forbade all new settlements west of a line drawn along the Appalachian Mountains, which was delineated as an Indian Reserve. Exclusion from the vast region of Trans-Appalachia created discontent between Britain and colonial land speculators and potential settlers. The proclamation and access to western lands was one of the first significant areas of dispute between Britain and the colonies and would become a contributing factor leading to the American Revolution. The 1763 proclamation line is more or less similar to the Eastern Continental Divide, extending from Georgia in the south to the divide&#x27;s northern terminus near the middle of the north border of Pennsylvania, where it intersects the northeasterly St. Lawrence Divide, and extends further through New England.

The Royal Proclamation continues to be of legal importance to First Nations in Canada, being the first legal recognition of aboriginal title, rights and freedoms. It is recognized in the Constitution Act, 1982, partly due to direct action by Indigenous peoples of Canada, known as the Constitution Express movement of 1980–1982.

==Background: Treaty of Paris==

The Seven Years&#x27; War and its North American theater, the French and Indian War, ended with the 1763 Treaty of Paris. Under the treaty, all French colonial territory west of the Mississippi River was ceded to Spain. In contrast, all French colonial territory east of the Mississippi River and south of Rupert&#x27;s Land (save Saint Pierre and Miquelon, which France kept) was ceded to Great Britain. Both Spain and Britain received some French islands in the Caribbean, while France kept Haiti and Guadeloupe.

==Provisions==
===New colonies===

The Proclamation of 1763 dealt with managing former French territories in North America that Britain acquired following its victory over France in the French and Indian War and regulating colonial settlers&#x27; expansion. It established new governments for several areas: the province of Quebec, the new colonies of West Florida and East Florida, and a group of Caribbean islands, Grenada, Tobago, Saint Vincent, and Dominica, collectively referred to as the British Ceded Islands.

==Proclamation line==

At the outset, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 defined the jurisdictional limits of the British territories of North America, limiting British colonial expansion on the continent. What remained of the Royal Province of New France east of the Great Lakes and the Ottawa River, and south of Rupert&#x27;s Land, was reorganised under the name &quot;Quebec.&quot; The territory northeast of the St. John River on the Labrador coast was reassigned to the Newfoundland Colony. The lands west of Quebec and west of a line running along the crest of the Allegheny Mountains became (British) Indian Territory, barred to settlement from colonies east of the line.

The proclamation line was not intended to be a permanent boundary between the colonists and Native American lands but rather a temporary boundary that could be extended further west in an orderly, lawful manner. It was also not designed as an uncrossable boundary; people could cross the line, but not settle past it. Its contour was defined by the headwaters that formed the watershed along the Appalachians. All land with rivers that flowed into the Atlantic was designated for the colonial entities. In contrast, all the land with rivers that flowed into the Mississippi was reserved for the Native American populations. The proclamation outlawed the private purchase of Native American land, which had often created problems. Instead, all future land purchases were to be made by Crown officials &quot;at some public Meeting or Assembly of the said Indians&quot;. British colonials were forbidden to settle on native lands, and colonial officials were forbidden to grant ground or lands without royal approval. Organized land companies asked for land grants, but were denied by King George III.

British colonists and land speculators objected to the proclamation boundary since the British government had already assigned land grants to them. Including the wealthy owners of the Ohio company, who protested the line to the governor of Virginia, as they had plans to settle the land to grow the business. Many settlements already existed beyond the proclamation line, some of which had been temporarily evacuated during Pontiac&#x27;s War, and there were many already granted land claims yet to be settled. For example, George Washington and his Virginia soldiers had been granted lands past the boundary. Prominent American colonials joined with the land speculators in Britain to lobby the government to move the line further west.

The colonists&#x27; demands were met and the boundary line was adjusted in a series of treaties with the Native Americans. The first two of these treaties were completed in 1768; the Treaty of Fort Stanwix adjusted the border with the Iroquois Confederacy in the Ohio Country and the Treaty of Hard Labour adjusted the border with the Cherokee in the Carolinas. The Treaty of Hard Labour was followed by the Treaty of Lochaber in 1770, adjusting the border between Virginia and the Cherokee. These agreements opened much of what is now Kentucky and West Virginia to British settlement. The land granted by the Virginian and North Carolinian government heavily favored the land companies, seeing as they had more wealthy backers than the poorer settlers who wanted to settle west in hopes of gaining a fortune.

==Response from colonists==
Many colonists disregarded the proclamation line and settled west, which created tension between them and the Native Americans. Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion (1763–1766) was a war involving Native American tribes, primarily from the Great Lakes region, the Illinois Country and the Ohio Country, who were dissatisfied with British postwar policies in the Great Lakes region after the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War. They were able to take over a large number of the forts which commanded the waterways involved in trade within the region and export to Great Britain. The proclamation line had been conceived before the onset of Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion, but the outbreak of this conflict hastened the process of making it law.

==Legacy==
===Indigenous peoples===

The Royal Proclamation continued to govern the cession of Indigenous land in British North America, especially Upper Canada and Rupert&#x27;s Land. Upper Canada created a platform for treaty-making based on the Royal Proclamation. After loyalists moved into land after Britain&#x27;s defeat in the American Revolution, the first impetus was created out of necessity.

According to historian Colin Calloway, &quot;scholars disagree on whether the proclamation recognized or undermined tribal sovereignty&quot;.

Some see the Royal Proclamation of 1763 as a &quot;fundamental document&quot; for First Nations land claims and self-government. It is &quot;the first legal recognition by the British Crown of Aboriginal rights&quot; and imposes a fiduciary duty of care on the Crown. The intent and promises made to the natives in the proclamation have been argued to be temporary, only meant to appease the Native peoples who were becoming increasingly resentful of &quot;settler encroachments on their lands&quot; and were capable of becoming a serious threat to British colonial settlement. Advice given by a Sir William Johnson, superintendent of Indian Affairs in North America, to the Board of Trade on 30 August 1764, expressed that:

Anishinaabe jurist John Borrows has written that &quot;the Proclamation illustrates the British government&#x27;s attempt to exercise sovereignty over First Nations while simultaneously trying to convince First Nations that they would remain separate from European settlers and have their jurisdiction preserved.&quot; Borrows further writes that the Royal Proclamation along with the subsequent Treaty of Niagara, provide for an argument that &quot;discredits the claims of the Crown to exercise sovereignty over First Nations&quot; and affirms Aboriginal &quot;powers of self-determination in, among other things, allocating lands&quot;.

===&quot;Johnson v. McIntosh&quot;===
The functional content of the proclamation was reintroduced into American law by the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Johnson v. McIntosh&quot; (1823).

===250th anniversary celebrations===
In October 2013, the 250th anniversary of the Royal Proclamation was celebrated in Ottawa with a meeting of Indigenous leaders and Governor-General David Johnston. The Aboriginal movement Idle No More held birthday parties for the document at various locations across Canada.

==United States==

The influence of the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on the coming of the American Revolution has been variously interpreted. Many historians argue that the proclamation ceased to be a significant source of tension after 1768 since the aforementioned later treaties opened up extensive lands for settlement. Others have argued that colonial resentment of the proclamation contributed to the growing divide between the colonies and the mother country. Some historians say that even though the boundary was pushed west in subsequent treaties, the British government refused to permit new colonial settlements for fear of instigating a war with Native Americans, which angered colonial land speculators. Others argue that the Royal Proclamation imposed a fiduciary duty of care on the Crown.

George Washington was given of land in the Ohio region for his services in the French and Indian War. In 1770, Washington took the lead in securing the rights of himself and his old soldiers in the French War, advancing money to pay expenses for the common cause and using his influence in the proper quarters. In August 1770, it was decided that Washington should personally make a trip to the western region, where he located and surveyed tracts for himself and military comrades. After some dispute, he was eventually granted a patent letter for tracts of land there. The lands involved were open to Virginians under terms of the Treaty of Lochaber of 1770, except for the lands located south of Fort Pitt, now known as Pittsburgh.

In the United States, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 ended with the American Revolutionary War because Great Britain ceded the land in question to the United States in the Treaty of Paris (1783). Afterward, the U.S. government faced difficulties preventing frontier violence and eventually adopted policies similar to the Royal Proclamation. The first in a series of Indian Intercourse Acts was passed in 1790, prohibiting unregulated trade and travel in Native American lands. In 1823, the U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Johnson v. McIntosh&quot; established that only the U.S. government, and not private individuals, could purchase land from Native Americans.

<text>Fullerton is an unincorporated area and census-designated place (CDP) in Whitehall Township in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. The population of Fullerton was 16,588 as of the 2020 census. 

Fullerton is a suburb of Allentown in the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th-most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. as of the 2020 census.

==History==

Originally known as &quot;Ferndale&quot;, the town was located on tracts of land originally settled by Giles Windsor (1767), Stephen Snyder (1786) and Jacob Yundt (1826). In 1895, the town was renamed &quot;Fullerton&quot; in honor of local businessman James W. Fuller Jr., who had purchased the railroad car wheel factory of Frederick &amp; Company in 1865 and operated it as McKee, Fuller &amp; Co. and later the Lehigh Car, Wheel &amp; Axle Works. Fuller laid out the hamlet in 1870, and by 1883 it was a thriving company town with a population in excess of 1,500 men and their families. When the Lehigh Valley cement industry exploded in the early 1900s, Fuller&#x27;s company prospered by providing machinery to the mills in the region, and the town supplied the workforce for both his factories, and the numerous mills and quarries operating in the immediate area.

The Dent Hardware Company Factory Complex in Fullerton was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.

==Geography==
Fullerton is located in eastern Lehigh County at (40.631297, -75.480215), in the southern part of Whitehall Township. It is bordered to the south by the city of Allentown and to the east by the Lehigh River. To the northeast, across the Lehigh River, is the borough of Catasauqua.

US-22 leads east to Easton and west with Interstate 78 to Harrisburg, the state capital. PA-145 leads south to the center of Allentown and north to Walnutport. The Lehigh Valley Mall is located in Fullerton on the northeastern side of the US-22/PA-145 interchange.

<text>Lower Macungie Township is a township in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, United States. The township&#x27;s population was 31,964 as of the 2020 census, making it the second-largest population center in Lehigh County after Allentown and the third-largest population center in the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area after Allentown and Bethlehem.

==History==
Before European settlement, the area that now includes Lower Macungie Township was inhabited by the Lenape Indian tribe. They hunted here, and are known to have had a few small seasonal villages and jasper workshops close to streams and springs. Jasper from their quarries outside present-day Macungie and Vera Cruz was traded throughout North America.

The name Macungie is derived from a Native American word meaning &quot;bear swamp,&quot; or &quot;place where bears feed.&quot; The early Pennsylvania German settlers took land that had been hunting grounds for the Lenni Lenape, adopting the Lenape name for the area. They cleared the scrub and forests, planted crops, raised livestock, and continually expanded their holdings. Most of what they produced fed their families and their hired and indentured servants, but some crops were grown for their cash value. Eventually they raised enough money to buy land warrants in Philadelphia from the proprietors, including William Penn&#x27;s heirs.

The Rodale Organic Gardening Experimental Farm, located in Lower Macungie Township, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.

<text>Macungie is a borough in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, United States, its second oldest. As of the 2020 census, Macungie had a population of 3,257.

Macungie is a suburb of Allentown, and part of the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th-most populous metropolitan statistical area in the U.S. as of the 2020 census.

==History==

Macungie is derived from &quot;Maguntsche&quot;, a place name used as early as 1730 to describe the region that is present-day Macungie and Emmaus, Pennsylvania. &quot;Maguntsche&quot; is a Lenape word, meaning either &quot;bear swamp&quot; or &quot;feeding place of the bears&quot;. The borough&#x27;s current seal depicts a bear coming to drink at water near some cattails. The Valentine Weaver House in Macungie was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

Macungie was founded as Millerstown in 1776 by Peter Miller. On November 15, 1857, the village of Millerstown was incorporated as a borough.

During Fries&#x27;s Rebellion in 1800, the United States Marshals Service began arresting people for tax resistance, and arrests were made without much incident until the marshal reached Millerstown, where a crowd formed to protect a man from arrest. Failing to make that arrest, the marshal arrested a few others and returned to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, with his prisoners. Two separate groups of rebels independently vowed to liberate the prisoners and marched on Bethlehem. The militia prevailed, and John Fries, leader of the rebellion, and others were arrested. In 1875, the borough was renamed Macungie to avoid confusion with another town by the same name: Millerstown in Perry County, Pennsylvania.

In 1737, Nicholas Kern was the first white settler in what would become Slatington. The Lenape Native Americans were already living along &quot;Warriors Path,&quot; which would become Route 873. Kern established a sawmill shortly after arriving.

In 1756, Benjamin Franklin reported to Governor Morris that he had procured boards and timber from Kern&#x27;s sawmill. In the 19th century two Welshmen, who recognized its properties and importance from being used in Europe, discovered slate. A quarry was set up in 1845, and, in 1847, a factory was erected. In 1864, Slatington was incorporated into a Borough of Pennsylvania; its first mayor was Robert McDowell. Historically, structural iron, knit goods, and silk were manufactured in Slatington, and there were abundant slate quarries in the area.

<text>South Whitehall Township is a township in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, United States. The township&#x27;s population was 19,180 at the 2010 census. It is a suburb of Allentown and is part of the Lehigh Valley, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th-most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. as of the 2020 census.

South Whitehall Township borders Allentown to its east and is northwest of Philadelphia, and west of New York City. The Lehigh Valley interchange of the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike and Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom are both located in the township.

==History==
===18th century===
The first settlers of the Lehigh Valley region were Germans, who emigrated from earlier settlements along Perkiomen Creek in present-day Lehigh and Montgomery counties. German settlers began arriving in present-day South Whitehall Township over a 20-year period beginning in about 1732. The immigration of the Germans and other European natives, including Swiss and Huguenots, was aided by William Penn and his friends. The land lying south of South Mountain was given to William Penn in 1713 by the Lenape Native American tribe. The land of Lehigh County between Blue Mountain and Lehigh Mountain was granted to Penn&#x27;s sons by the Lenape in 1732. European emigrants were drawn to the area because of its reputation for fertile land and its limestone flanking rivers and streams, including present-day Jordan Creek.

One of the earliest tracts of land purchased in the township was by Nicholas Kern, who bought property on December 3, 1735, and October 28, 1737. Some of this was sold to Lorenz Guth on February 27, 1739. Guth continued to buy land in the area of the Reformed Church property and also in the Guthsville area. By 1769, his holdings totaled . The Lorenz Guth house near Wehr&#x27;s Dam still stands in excellent condition and is an example of colonial architecture.

Much of the history of South Whitehall can be traced to the Walbert-Guthsville region, and especially the two Jordan churches. The first ministration to the Lutherans in the township occurred in 1734 when Reverend John Casper Stoever baptized Margaret, the daughter of the John Lichtenwalners, on February 6.

In 1736, a Reverend Schmidt preached occasionally to the Lutherans. In 1739, Reverend John Justus Jacob Birkenstock became pastor of the Jordan Lutheran congregation. In 1845, the centennial of the congregation was observed, suggesting that the first building was likely erected in 1745. The first church building was of logs and stood near the north wall of the old burial ground. It was used jointly by the Lutheran and Reformed congregations until about 1752 when the Reformed erected a building half a mile to the east, within sight of the current municipal building.

The original name &quot;Whitehall&quot; dates to 1740 and encompasses the land now found in North Whitehall, South Whitehall, and Whitehall townships. Prior to the establishment of Northampton County in 1752, the area was part of Bucks County, and the land currently occupied by South Whitehall was known as &quot;the back part of Macungie&quot; on the Heidelberg District. The name Whitehall is thought to be derived from one of two sources: either a place in England, or for a white house erected as a hunting lodge near Jordan and Cedar creeks.

The Lutherans built the present church in 1842–1843 at a cost of $3,581.24 (). It was renovated in 1868. In 1886, a fine, shapely, slate-covered steeple, high, was erected.

Members of the United Church of Christ religion settled in the area as early as 1738, and baptisms of their children during the period of 1740 to 1752 are recorded in the Lutheran record book. In 1752, Lorenz Guth presented the Reformed with a tract of land, and a log church was erected in six weeks. The second and present church building, with its steeple, was built in 1808. It stands as one of the oldest church buildings in the country, and is a fine example of the architecture of that period.

The early schools of the township were connected with the two Jordan churches for many years, possibly extending back to 1739. According to the Roberts history, the congregations were at first supplied not by pastors, but by teachers who used to read sermons on Sundays.

===19th century===
South Whitehall Township was established in 1810 following a petition to the Northampton County Court to divide former Whitehall Township into two areas, North Whitehall and South Whitehall. In 1812, Lehigh County was divided off from the original Northampton County, establishing South Whitehall Township within and nearly at the center of Lehigh County. Agriculture was the backbone of the economy of the township for many years. Much of the land today still is under cultivation. For over a century, at least six grain mills flourished on Jordan and Cedar creeks.

In the early 19th century, iron ore was discovered at different places in the township, and mining operations were carried on from 1820 to 1890. In 1867, the eastern portion of South Whitehall and the southeastern portion of North Whitehall were detached and formed into Whitehall Township.

<text>Whitehall Township is a township with home rule status in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, United States. The township&#x27;s population was 26,738 as of the 2010 census.

Whitehall Township is a suburb of Allentown in the Lehigh Valley metropolitan region, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th-most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. as of the 2020 census.

The township is north of Allentown, northwest of Philadelphia, and west of New York City.

==History==

The Province of Pennsylvania was created in 1681 when King Charles II granted a tract of land in America to William Penn.

===18th century===
After the death of Penn, his sons, John, Thomas, and Richard, became the owners of Pennsylvania. The Lenape Indian tribe deeded that part of Lehigh County lying between the South Mountain and Blue Mountain to Penn&#x27;s sons in 1736.

A wave of German immigrants from Germany&#x27;s Palatinate settled in Whitehall Township. The first was Jacob Kohler, who settled in the vicinity of Egypt about 1728. The settlers staked their claim on the lands by applying to the Penns for a land warrant. They cleared the land for farming and established churches around which villages grew.

When the first European settlers came to the Whitehall area, the Lenape people were living on the banks of Hokendauqua Creek. The Europeans and the Lenape designed a deal to determine how much land the Europeans would acquire based on how far the Europeans were able to walk in two days. To gain more land, the Europeans paid a professional runner who got as far as what is now Coaldale, in Schuylkill County.

The Lenape lived peacefully among the German settlers for a time. But the tribe suffered injustices at the hands of the settlers and lashed back during a 1763 uprising in Lehigh County. Fort Deshler, which stood near Route 145 at Chestnut Street, played a key role in the defense of settler-held lands during this battle, in which 23 settlers were killed.

===19th century===
The original Whitehall Township, established in 1753, was split into the three townships of Whitehall, North Whitehall, and South Whitehall in 1867. The name Whitehall is said to have originated from Lynford Lardner&#x27;s hunting lodge that was painted with whitewash. Lardner named it &quot;Grouse Hall&quot;, but the common people of the region called it &quot;White Hall&quot;. Whitehall Township&#x27;s villages include Cementon, Egypt, Fullerton, Hokendauqua, Mickleys, Stiles, and West Catasauqua. Coplay was also part of Whitehall until it incorporated as a borough in 1869. Agriculture was the major industry until the mid-1800s. Today, about are under cultivation. There were six grist mills in Whitehall, built to process grains for the farmers into flour and animal feed. Only one grist mill remains, the Helfrich Springs Grist Mill, which is also home to the Whitehall Historical Preservation Society, which has preserved the building for use as a local history museum.

Completion of the Lehigh Canal in 1829 led to further development. Discovery of iron ore deposits brought Whitehall into the Industrial Revolution when the first blast iron furnace was built in Hokendauqua in 1854. This was immediately followed by the establishment of a railroad system to transport raw materials to the furnaces and to ship the final product. Population grew rapidly as these industries attracted Welsh and Irish immigrants.

While the railroads were being constructed, cuts in the bedrock led to the discovery of Whitehall&#x27;s deposits of Jacksonburg limestone. David O. Saylor perfected and patented the process of manufacturing Portland cement. The first Portland cement plant was located between the villages of Cementon and Coplay. Others quickly followed, and by 1914 70% of the cement produced in the United States came from the &quot;Cement Belt&quot; or Lehigh District. The cement industry attracted a new wave of immigrants from Austria-Hungary, creating yet another population spurt.

===20th century===
Whitehall became classified as a first class township with a population of 7,935 in 1900. This gave the township specified municipal rights for supplying electric lights, highways, and sewers at public expense. The post-World War II era began the transition from the manufacturing industries to the retail industry as Whitehall became a bedroom community and suburb of Allentown. The individual villages united into a single entity known as Whitehall in 1968, when the U.S. Post Office combined its separate town branches. Breadon Field, which was the home field for a series of Minor League Baseball teams from the stadium&#x27;s 1948 opening until its 1964 demolition, was based in Whitehall Township.

In 1974, voters approved the adoption of a Home Rule Charter form of government, creating a seven-member legislative body and an elected mayor. Today, with an annual budget in excess of $21 million, Whitehall provides a full range of municipal services to its residents.

==Geography==
Whitehall Township is in eastern Lehigh County on the north side of the city of Allentown. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 2.22%, are water. Whitehall is drained by the Lehigh River, which forms the eastern boundary of the township, separating it from the boroughs of Northampton and North Catasauqua in Northampton County and the borough of Catasauqua in Lehigh County.

The township was originally created on March 20, 1753, and included what is now North Whitehall and South Whitehall townships. In 1810, a petition was made to the Northampton County Court to split the township into two portions; at the time, the area now encompassed by Lehigh County was part of Northampton County. The name &quot;Whitehall&quot; refers to a white hall that was built along Jordan Creek in the early 1700s as a hunting lodge. The area had a large ruffed grouse population along with numerous white-tailed deer, eastern elk, eastern wolves, and black bear. Mountain lions or cougars may have also existed within Whitehall Township at some point in time. Because of the rich biodiversity of the area it became known as the wilderness of Whitehall. Old-growth forest consisting of oak, tulip poplar, hickory, black walnut, sugar maple, basswood, American chestnut, American beech, and sycamore covered the entire township.

In 1867, eastern portions of both North and South Whitehall were reapportioned into the current Whitehall Township. The new Whitehall Township is generally rectangular in shape, running from north-northwest to south-southeast, and is situated along the western bank of the Lehigh River. Two years after the new township&#x27;s formation, the borough of Coplay was incorporated, removing from the township a square section of .

The township&#x27;s villages include Cementon, Eagle Point, Egypt, Fullerton, Hokendauqua, Mickleys, North Coplay, Scherersville (also in South Whitehall), Stiles, and West Catasauqua.

The legislative branch consists of a Township Board of Commissioners of seven (7) members, each serving 4-year terms. Four of the seats have terms that overlap the remaining three seat terms (e.g. four of the current terms end in 2007, while the remaining 3 terms end in 2009). The seated members then elect a President and Vice President who conduct Board meetings.

The executive branch consists of a Mayor, who also serves a 4-year term. The Mayor may appoint a Deputy Mayor at his/her discretion, with approval from the Board of Commissioners. The Deputy Mayor does not automatically become Mayor should the standing Mayor leave office for any reason—a replacement is to be appointed by the Board of Commissioners.

<text>The Back Mountain is a region and former census-designated place (CDP) in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is near the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre. The population was 33,551 as of 2016. The region has a total area of . The area was not delineated as a CDP for the 2010 census. The name &quot;Back Mountain&quot; refers to the area&#x27;s location behind the mountain ridge forming the northwest side of the Wyoming Valley. The area includes the townships of Dallas, Franklin, Jackson, Kingston, Lake, and Lehman. The region also includes the boroughs of Dallas and Harveys Lake. Each township and borough is independently governed.

==History==
The townships of Dallas, Franklin, Jackson, Kingston, Lake, and Lehman were formed in the 1800s. The area now known as Dallas was first settled in 1797. It was incorporated as a borough on April 21, 1879, from a section of Dallas Township. The township, formed in 1817, and was named for Alexander J. Dallas, the 6th United States Secretary of the Treasury and the father of George M. Dallas the vice president of James Polk. The Borough of Dallas is known as the “Pride” of the Back Mountain.

The second borough in the Back Mountain region is Harveys Lake. The lake was named after Benjamin Harvey, who discovered the lake in 1781. He was a member of the Sons of Liberty, an eminent colonial-era group opposed to Great Britain&#x27;s Stamp Act and a driving force behind the American Revolution. The first resident in the vicinity of the lake, Matthew Scouten, arrived in the early 1790s, others settlers, the Worthingtons, arrived in 1806.

Historically the area offered many forms of recreation and entertainment attracting tourists from all over the Northeast. Harveys Lake became a major resort destination in the early 20th century. Hotels, boathouses, a casino, and an amusement park were constructed around Harveys Lake. Grand Hotel Oneonta was especially prominent in the early 1900s, and former United States President Theodore Roosevelt visited the hotel in August 1912. Harveys Lake was incorporated as a borough in 1968.

Frances Slocum State Park is the only state park in the Back Mountain. In 1968, the lake, which is the centerpiece of the park, was built to control flooding in the North Branch Susquehanna River. In 1972, the park became a temporary home to 280 families who were displaced by the Agnes floods. The park was closed temporarily to the public and reopened in 1974 after all the families were relocated.

<text>Bear Creek Township is a township in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The township has a total area of , making it is the largest municipality (by total area) in Luzerne County. The population was 2,752 at the 2020 census.

==History==
===First settlers===
Bear Creek was first settled in the late 18th century. The first log cabin was built in 1786 (about nine miles from Wilkes-Barre). Bear Creek, with its abundance of trees, became the lumber king of Luzerne County. The first sawmill was built in 1800 by Oliver Helme. Many more sawmills were later constructed throughout the 19th century.

===Township===
Bear Creek was later incorporated as a township; it was carved from territory taken from Wilkes-Barre, Pittston, Bucks, Plains, and Jenkins (in 1856). By 1890, the community had a population of 343.

In 1961, the Bear Creek Dam was constructed in the southern portion of the township. The dam spans the Lehigh River at its confluence with the tributary Bear Creek. Although the dam was originally constructed for flood management, its reservoir has since become a popular recreational area for fishing, kayaking, and boating. In 1963, the dam was renamed after a United States Congressman (Francis E. Walter).

In 1993, Bear Creek Village broke away from the township and became a borough. Today, the township is made up of several small villages, thick forests, lakes, and streams.

===Air disaster=== 

Bear Creek Township was the site of a plane crash on May 21, 2000; it crashed while attempting to land at the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport. As described by the BBC, the crash occurred in a &quot;wooded area&quot; of the township, near the intersection of Bear Creek Boulevard (PA-Route 115) and the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

The accident killed the pilot as well as all 19 passengers. NTSB investigation ruled that the crash was probably due to low fuel. The incident spurred an FBI investigation and made news across the globe. Passenger safety in the aviation field became a major issue of the 2000 U.S. presidential election.

===21st century===
The Bear Creek Wind Power Project began commercial operation in 2006. The wind farm consists of twelve Gamesa 2.0 MW wind turbines.

<text>The second law of thermodynamics is a physical law based on universal empirical observation concerning heat and energy interconversions. A simple statement of the law is that heat always flows spontaneously from hotter to colder regions of matter (or &#x27;downhill&#x27; in terms of the temperature gradient). Another statement is: &quot;Not all heat can be converted into work in a cyclic process.&quot;

The second law of thermodynamics establishes the concept of entropy as a physical property of a thermodynamic system. It predicts whether processes are forbidden despite obeying the requirement of conservation of energy as expressed in the first law of thermodynamics and provides necessary criteria for spontaneous processes. For example, the first law allows the process of a cup falling off a table and breaking on the floor, as well as allowing the reverse process of the cup fragments coming back together and &#x27;jumping&#x27; back onto the table, while the second law allows the former and denies the latter. The second law may be formulated by the observation that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease, as they always tend toward a state of thermodynamic equilibrium where the entropy is highest at the given internal energy. An increase in the combined entropy of system and surroundings accounts for the irreversibility of natural processes, often referred to in the concept of the arrow of time.

Historically, the second law was an empirical finding that was accepted as an axiom of thermodynamic theory. Statistical mechanics provides a microscopic explanation of the law in terms of probability distributions of the states of large assemblies of atoms or molecules. The second law has been expressed in many ways. Its first formulation, which preceded the proper definition of entropy and was based on caloric theory, is Carnot&#x27;s theorem, formulated by the French scientist Sadi Carnot, who in 1824 showed that the efficiency of conversion of heat to work in a heat engine has an upper limit. The first rigorous definition of the second law based on the concept of entropy came from German scientist Rudolf Clausius in the 1850s and included his statement that heat can never pass from a colder to a warmer body without some other change, connected therewith, occurring at the same time.

The second law of thermodynamics allows the definition of the concept of thermodynamic temperature, but this has been formally delegated to the zeroth law of thermodynamics.

== Introduction ==
The first law of thermodynamics provides the definition of the internal energy of a thermodynamic system, and expresses its change for a closed system in terms of work and heat. It can be linked to the law of conservation of energy. Conceptually, the first law describes the fundamental principle that systems do not consume or &#x27;use up&#x27; energy, that energy is neither created nor destroyed, but is simply converted from one form to another.

The second law is concerned with the direction of natural processes. It asserts that a natural process runs only in one sense, and is not reversible. That is, the state of a natural system itself can be reversed, but not without increasing the entropy of the system&#x27;s surroundings, that is, both the state of the system plus the state of its surroundings cannot be together, fully reversed, without implying the destruction of entropy.

For example, when a path for conduction or radiation is made available, heat always flows spontaneously from a hotter to a colder body. Such phenomena are accounted for in terms of entropy change. A heat pump can reverse this heat flow, but the reversal process and the original process, both cause entropy production, thereby increasing the entropy of the system&#x27;s surroundings. If an isolated system containing distinct subsystems is held initially in internal thermodynamic equilibrium by internal partitioning by impermeable walls between the subsystems, and then some operation makes the walls more permeable, then the system spontaneously evolves to reach a final new internal thermodynamic equilibrium, and its total entropy, formula_1, increases.

In a reversible or quasi-static, idealized process of transfer of energy as heat to a closed thermodynamic system of interest, (which allows the entry or exit of energy – but not transfer of matter), from an auxiliary thermodynamic system, an infinitesimal increment (formula_2) in the entropy of the system of interest is defined to result from an infinitesimal transfer of heat (formula_3) to the system of interest, divided by the common thermodynamic temperature formula_4 of the system of interest and the auxiliary thermodynamic system:
: formula_5

Different notations are used for an infinitesimal amount of heat formula_6 and infinitesimal change of entropy formula_7 because entropy is a function of state, while heat, like work, is not.

For an actually possible infinitesimal process without exchange of mass with the surroundings, the second law requires that the increment in system entropy fulfills the inequality
: formula_8

This is because a general process for this case (no mass exchange between the system and its surroundings) may include work being done on the system by its surroundings, which can have frictional or viscous effects inside the system, because a chemical reaction may be in progress, or because heat transfer actually occurs only irreversibly, driven by a finite difference between the system temperature () and the temperature of the surroundings ().

The equality still applies for pure heat flow (only heat flow, no change in chemical composition and mass),
: formula_9
which is the basis of the accurate determination of the absolute entropy of pure substances from measured heat capacity curves and entropy changes at phase transitions, i.e. by calorimetry.

The zeroth law of thermodynamics in its usual short statement allows recognition that two bodies in a relation of thermal equilibrium have the same temperature, especially that a test body has the same temperature as a reference thermometric body. For a body in thermal equilibrium with another, there are indefinitely many empirical temperature scales, in general respectively depending on the properties of a particular reference thermometric body. The second law allows a distinguished temperature scale, which defines an absolute, thermodynamic temperature, independent of the properties of any particular reference thermometric body.

== Various statements of the law ==
The second law of thermodynamics may be expressed in many specific ways, the most prominent classical statements being the statement by Rudolf Clausius (1854), the statement by Lord Kelvin (1851), and the statement in axiomatic thermodynamics by Constantin Carathéodory (1909). These statements cast the law in general physical terms citing the impossibility of certain processes. The Clausius and the Kelvin statements have been shown to be equivalent.

=== Carnot&#x27;s principle ===
The historical origin of the second law of thermodynamics was in Sadi Carnot&#x27;s theoretical analysis of the flow of heat in steam engines (1824). The centerpiece of that analysis, now known as a Carnot engine, is an ideal heat engine fictively operated in the limiting mode of extreme slowness known as quasi-static, so that the heat and work transfers are between subsystems that are always in their own internal states of thermodynamic equilibrium. It represents the theoretical maximum efficiency of a heat engine operating between any two given thermal or heat reservoirs at different temperatures. Carnot&#x27;s principle was recognized by Carnot at a time when the caloric theory represented the dominant understanding of the nature of heat, before the recognition of the first law of thermodynamics, and before the mathematical expression of the concept of entropy. Interpreted in the light of the first law, Carnot&#x27;s analysis is physically equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics, and remains valid today. Some samples from his book are:
:: ...&quot;wherever there exists a difference of temperature, motive power can be produced.&quot;
:: The production of motive power is then due in steam engines not to an actual consumption of caloric, but &quot;to its transportation from a warm body to a cold body ...&quot;
:: &quot;The motive power of heat is independent of the agents employed to realize it; its quantity is fixed solely by the temperatures of the bodies between which is effected, finally, the transfer of caloric.&quot;

In modern terms, Carnot&#x27;s principle may be stated more precisely:
: The efficiency of a quasi-static or reversible Carnot cycle depends only on the temperatures of the two heat reservoirs, and is the same, whatever the working substance. A Carnot engine operated in this way is the most efficient possible heat engine using those two temperatures.

=== Clausius statement ===
The German scientist Rudolf Clausius laid the foundation for the second law of thermodynamics in 1850 by examining the relation between heat transfer and work. His formulation of the second law, which was published in German in 1854, is known as the &quot;Clausius statement&quot;:
Heat can never pass from a colder to a warmer body without some other change, connected therewith, occurring at the same time.

The statement by Clausius uses the concept of &#x27;passage of heat&#x27;. As is usual in thermodynamic discussions, this means &#x27;net transfer of energy as heat&#x27;, and does not refer to contributory transfers one way and the other.

Heat cannot spontaneously flow from cold regions to hot regions without external work being performed on the system, which is evident from ordinary experience of refrigeration, for example. In a refrigerator, heat is transferred from cold to hot, but only when forced by an external agent, the refrigeration system.

=== Kelvin statements ===
Lord Kelvin expressed the second law in several wordings.
:: It is impossible for a self-acting machine, unaided by any external agency, to convey heat from one body to another at a higher temperature.
:: It is impossible, by means of inanimate material agency, to derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below the temperature of the coldest of the surrounding objects.

=== Equivalence of the Clausius and the Kelvin statements ===

Suppose there is an engine violating the Kelvin statement: i.e., one that drains heat and converts it completely into work (the drained heat is fully converted to work) in a cyclic fashion without any other result. Now pair it with a reversed Carnot engine as shown by the right figure. The efficiency of a normal heat engine is &quot;η&quot; and so the efficiency of the reversed heat engine is 1/&quot;η&quot;. The net and sole effect of the combined pair of engines is to transfer heat formula_10 from the cooler reservoir to the hotter one, which violates the Clausius statement. This is a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics, as for the total system&#x27;s energy to remain the same; formula_11, so therefore formula_12, where (1) the sign convention of heat is used in which heat entering into (leaving from) an engine is positive (negative) and (2) formula_13 is obtained by the definition of efficiency of the engine when the engine operation is not reversed. Thus a violation of the Kelvin statement implies a violation of the Clausius statement, i.e. the Clausius statement implies the Kelvin statement. We can prove in a similar manner that the Kelvin statement implies the Clausius statement, and hence the two are equivalent.

=== Planck&#x27;s proposition ===
Planck offered the following proposition as derived directly from experience. This is sometimes regarded as his statement of the second law, but he regarded it as a starting point for the derivation of the second law.
:: It is impossible to construct an engine which will work in a complete cycle, and produce no effect except the production of work and cooling of a heat reservoir.

=== Relation between Kelvin&#x27;s statement and Planck&#x27;s proposition ===
It is almost customary in textbooks to speak of the &quot;Kelvin–Planck statement&quot; of the law, as for example in the text by ter Haar and Wergeland. This version, also known as the heat engine statement, of the second law states that 
:: It is impossible to devise a cyclically operating device, the sole effect of which is to absorb energy in the form of heat from a single thermal reservoir and to deliver an equivalent amount of work.

=== Planck&#x27;s statement ===
Max Planck stated the second law as follows.
:: Every process occurring in nature proceeds in the sense in which the sum of the entropies of all bodies taking part in the process is increased. In the limit, i.e. for reversible processes, the sum of the entropies remains unchanged.

Rather like Planck&#x27;s statement is that of George Uhlenbeck and G. W. Ford for &quot;irreversible phenomena&quot;.

:: ... in an irreversible or spontaneous change from one equilibrium state to another (as for example the equalization of temperature of two bodies A and B, when brought in contact) the entropy always increases.

=== Principle of Carathéodory ===

Constantin Carathéodory formulated thermodynamics on a purely mathematical axiomatic foundation. His statement of the second law is known as the Principle of Carathéodory, which may be formulated as follows:
In every neighborhood of any state S of an adiabatically enclosed system there are states inaccessible from S.
With this formulation, he described the concept of adiabatic accessibility for the first time and provided the foundation for a new subfield of classical thermodynamics, often called geometrical thermodynamics. It follows from Carathéodory&#x27;s principle that quantity of energy quasi-statically transferred as heat is a holonomic process function, in other words, formula_14.

Though it is almost customary in textbooks to say that Carathéodory&#x27;s principle expresses the second law and to treat it as equivalent to the Clausius or to the Kelvin-Planck statements, such is not the case. To get all the content of the second law, Carathéodory&#x27;s principle needs to be supplemented by Planck&#x27;s principle, that isochoric work always increases the internal energy of a closed system that was initially in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium.

=== Planck&#x27;s principle ===
In 1926, Max Planck wrote an important paper on the basics of thermodynamics. He indicated the principle
:: The internal energy of a closed system is increased by an adiabatic process, throughout the duration of which, the volume of the system remains constant.

This formulation does not mention heat and does not mention temperature, nor even entropy, and does not necessarily implicitly rely on those concepts, but it implies the content of the second law. A closely related statement is that &quot;Frictional pressure never does positive work.&quot; Planck wrote: &quot;The production of heat by friction is irreversible.&quot;

Not mentioning entropy, this principle of Planck is stated in physical terms. It is very closely related to the Kelvin statement given just above. It is relevant that for a system at constant volume and mole numbers, the entropy is a monotonic function of the internal energy. Nevertheless, this principle of Planck is not actually Planck&#x27;s preferred statement of the second law, which is quoted above, in a previous sub-section of the present section of this present article, and relies on the concept of entropy.

A statement that in a sense is complementary to Planck&#x27;s principle is made by Claus Borgnakke and Richard E. Sonntag. They do not offer it as a full statement of the second law:
:: ... there is only one way in which the entropy of a [closed] system can be decreased, and that is to transfer heat from the system.

Differing from Planck&#x27;s just foregoing principle, this one is explicitly in terms of entropy change. Removal of matter from a system can also decrease its entropy.

=== Relating the second law to the definition of temperature ===
The second law has been shown to be equivalent to the internal energy defined as a convex function of the other extensive properties of the system. That is, when a system is described by stating its internal energy , an extensive variable, as a function of its entropy , volume , and mol number , i.e. ), then the temperature is equal to the partial derivative of the internal energy with respect to the entropy (essentially equivalent to the first equation for and held constant):
: formula_15

=== Second law statements, such as the Clausius inequality, involving radiative fluxes ===
The Clausius inequality, as well as some other statements of the second law, must be re-stated to have general applicability for all forms of heat transfer, i.e. scenarios involving radiative fluxes. For example, the integrand (đQ/T) of the Clausius expression applies to heat conduction and convection, and the case of ideal infinitesimal blackbody radiation (BR) transfer, but does not apply to most radiative transfer scenarios and in some cases has no physical meaning whatsoever. Consequently, the Clausius inequality was re-stated so that it is applicable to cycles with processes involving any form of heat transfer. The entropy transfer with radiative fluxes (formula_16) is taken separately from that due to heat transfer by conduction and convection (formula_17), where the temperature is evaluated at the system boundary where the heat transfer occurs. The modified Clausius inequality, for all heat transfer scenarios, can then be expressed as,formula_18

In a nutshell, the Clausius inequality is saying that when a cycle is completed, the change in the state property S will be zero, so the entropy that was produced during the cycle must have transferred out of the system by heat transfer. The formula_19 (or đ) indicates a path dependent integration.

Due to the inherent emission of radiation from all matter, most entropy flux calculations involve incident, reflected and emitted radiative fluxes. The energy and entropy of unpolarized blackbody thermal radiation, is calculated using the spectral energy and entropy radiance expressions derived by Max Planck using equilibrium statistical mechanics,formula_20
formula_21
where &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light, &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant, &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant, &quot;ν&quot; is frequency, and the quantities &quot;K&quot;v and &quot;L&quot;v are the energy and entropy fluxes per unit frequency, area, and solid angle. In deriving this blackbody spectral entropy radiance, with the goal of deriving the blackbody energy formula, Planck postulated that the energy of a photon was quantized (partly to simplify the mathematics), thereby starting quantum theory.
A non-equilibrium statistical mechanics approach has also been used to obtain the same result as Planck, indicating it has wider significance and represents a non-equilibrium entropy. A plot of &quot;K&quot;v versus frequency (v) for various values of temperature (&quot;T)&quot; gives a family of blackbody radiation energy spectra, and likewise for the entropy spectra. For non-blackbody radiation (NBR) emission fluxes, the spectral entropy radiance &quot;L&quot;v is found by substituting &quot;K&quot;v spectral energy radiance data into the &quot;L&quot;v expression (noting that emitted and reflected entropy fluxes are, in general, not independent). For the emission of NBR, including graybody radiation (GR), the resultant emitted entropy flux, or radiance &quot;L&quot;, has a higher ratio of entropy-to-energy (&quot;L/K&quot;), than that of BR. That is, the entropy flux of NBR emission is farther removed from the conduction and convection &quot;q&quot;/&quot;T&quot; result, than that for BR emission. This observation is consistent with Max Planck&#x27;s blackbody radiation energy and entropy formulas and is consistent with the fact that blackbody radiation emission represents the maximum emission of entropy for all materials with the same temperature, as well as the maximum entropy emission for all radiation with the same energy radiance.

=== Generalized conceptual statement of the second law principle ===
Second law analysis is valuable in scientific and engineering analysis in that it provides a number of benefits over energy analysis alone, including the basis for determining energy quality (exergy content), understanding fundamental physical phenomena, and improving performance evaluation and optimization. As a result, a conceptual statement of the principle is very useful in engineering analysis. Thermodynamic systems can be categorized by the four combinations of either entropy (S) up or down, and uniformity (Y) – between system and its environment – up or down. This &#x27;special&#x27; category of processes, category IV, is characterized by movement in the direction of low disorder and low uniformity, counteracting the second law tendency towards uniformity and disorder.
The second law can be conceptually stated as follows: Matter and energy have the tendency to reach a state of uniformity or internal and external equilibrium, a state of maximum disorder (entropy). Real non-equilibrium processes always produce entropy, causing increased disorder in the universe, while idealized reversible processes produce no entropy and no process is known to exist that destroys entropy. The tendency of a system to approach uniformity may be counteracted, and the system may become more ordered or complex, by the combination of two things, a work or exergy source and some form of instruction or intelligence. Where &#x27;exergy&#x27; is the thermal, mechanical, electric or chemical work potential of an energy source or flow, and &#x27;instruction or intelligence&#x27;, although subjective, is in the context of the set of category IV processes.

Consider a category IV example of robotic manufacturing and assembly of vehicles in a factory. The robotic machinery requires electrical work input and instructions, but when completed, the manufactured products have less uniformity with their surroundings, or more complexity (higher order) relative to the raw materials they were made from. Thus, system entropy or disorder decreases while the tendency towards uniformity between the system and its environment is counteracted. In this example, the instructions, as well as the source of work may be internal or external to the system, and they may or may not cross the system boundary. To illustrate, the instructions may be pre-coded and the electrical work may be stored in an energy storage system on-site. Alternatively, the control of the machinery may be by remote operation over a communications network, while the electric work is supplied to the factory from the local electric grid. In addition, humans may directly play, in whole or in part, the role that the robotic machinery plays in manufacturing. In this case, instructions may be involved, but intelligence is either directly responsible, or indirectly responsible, for the direction or application of work in such a way as to counteract the tendency towards disorder and uniformity.

There are also situations where the entropy spontaneously decreases by means of energy and entropy transfer. When thermodynamic constraints are not present, spontaneously energy or mass, as well as accompanying entropy, may be transferred out of a system in a progress to reach external equilibrium or uniformity in intensive properties of the system with its surroundings. This occurs spontaneously because the energy or mass transferred from the system to its surroundings results in a higher entropy in the surroundings, that is, it results in higher overall entropy of the system plus its surroundings. Note that this transfer of entropy requires dis-equilibrium in properties, such as a temperature difference. One example of this is the cooling crystallization of water that can occur when the system&#x27;s surroundings are below freezing temperatures. Unconstrained heat transfer can spontaneously occur, leading to water molecules freezing into a crystallized structure of reduced disorder (sticking together in a certain order due to molecular attraction). The entropy of the system decreases, but the system approaches uniformity with its surroundings (category III).

On the other hand, consider the refrigeration of water in a warm environment. Due to refrigeration, as heat is extracted from the water, the temperature and entropy of the water decreases, as the system moves further away from uniformity with its warm surroundings or environment (category IV). The main point, take-away, is that refrigeration not only requires a source of work, it requires designed equipment, as well as pre-coded or direct operational intelligence or instructions to achieve the desired refrigeration effect.

=== Perpetual motion of the second kind ===

Before the establishment of the second law, many people who were interested in inventing a perpetual motion machine had tried to circumvent the restrictions of first law of thermodynamics by extracting the massive internal energy of the environment as the power of the machine. Such a machine is called a &quot;perpetual motion machine of the second kind&quot;. The second law declared the impossibility of such machines.

=== Carnot&#x27;s theorem ===
Carnot&#x27;s theorem (1824) is a principle that limits the maximum efficiency for any possible engine. The efficiency solely depends on the temperature difference between the hot and cold thermal reservoirs. Carnot&#x27;s theorem states:
* All irreversible heat engines between two heat reservoirs are less efficient than a Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs.
* All reversible heat engines between two heat reservoirs are equally efficient with a Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs.

In his ideal model, the heat of caloric converted into work could be reinstated by reversing the motion of the cycle, a concept subsequently known as thermodynamic reversibility. Carnot, however, further postulated that some caloric is lost, not being converted to mechanical work. Hence, no real heat engine could realize the Carnot cycle&#x27;s reversibility and was condemned to be less efficient.

Though formulated in terms of caloric (see the obsolete caloric theory), rather than entropy, this was an early insight into the second law.

=== Clausius inequality ===
The Clausius theorem (1854) states that in a cyclic process
: formula_22

The equality holds in the reversible case and the strict inequality holds in the irreversible case, with &quot;T&quot;surr as the temperature of the heat bath (surroundings) here. The reversible case is used to introduce the state function entropy. This is because in cyclic processes the variation of a state function is zero from state functionality.

=== Thermodynamic temperature ===

For an arbitrary heat engine, the efficiency is:
 = \frac{q_H+q_\text{C}}{q_\text{H}} = 1 - \frac&lt;/math&gt;|}}
where &quot;W&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the net work done by the engine per cycle, &quot;q&quot;H &gt; 0 is the heat added to the engine from a hot reservoir, and &quot;q&quot;C = − &lt; 0 is waste heat given off to a cold reservoir from the engine. Thus the efficiency depends only on the ratio / .

Carnot&#x27;s theorem states that all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient. Thus, any reversible heat engine operating between temperatures &quot;T&quot;H and &quot;T&quot;C must have the same efficiency, that is to say, the efficiency is a function of temperatures only: 
In addition, a reversible heat engine operating between temperatures &quot;T&quot;1 and &quot;T&quot;3 must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles, one between &quot;T&quot;1 and another (intermediate) temperature &quot;T&quot;2, and the second between &quot;T&quot;2 and &quot;T&quot;3, where &quot;T&quot;1 &gt; &quot;T&quot;2 &gt; &quot;T&quot;3. This is because, if a part of the two cycle engine is hidden such that it is recognized as an engine between the reservoirs at the temperatures &quot;T&quot;1 and &quot;T&quot;3, then the efficiency of this engine must be same to the other engine at the same reservoirs. If we choose engines such that work done by the one cycle engine and the two cycle engine are same, then the efficiency of each heat engine is written as the below.
: formula_23,
: formula_24,
: formula_25.

Here, the engine 1 is the one cycle engine, and the engines 2 and 3 make the two cycle engine where there is the intermediate reservoir at &quot;T&quot;2. We also have used the fact that the heat formula_26 passes through the intermediate thermal reservoir at formula_27 without losing its energy. (I.e., formula_26 is not lost during its passage through the reservoir at formula_27.) This fact can be proved by the following.
: formula_30

In order to have the consistency in the last equation, the heat formula_26 flown from the engine 2 to the intermediate reservoir must be equal to the heat formula_32 flown out from the reservoir to the engine 3.

Then
: formula_33

Now consider the case where formula_34 is a fixed reference temperature: the temperature of the triple point of water as 273.16 K; formula_35. Then for any &quot;T&quot;2 and &quot;T&quot;3,
: formula_36

Therefore, if thermodynamic temperature &quot;T&quot;* is defined by
: formula_37
then the function &quot;f&quot;, viewed as a function of thermodynamic temperatures, is simply
: formula_38
and the reference temperature &quot;T&quot;1* = 273.16 K × &quot;f&quot;(&quot;T&quot;1,&quot;T&quot;1) = 273.16 K. (Any reference temperature and any positive numerical value could be usedthe choice here corresponds to the Kelvin scale.)

=== Entropy ===

According to the Clausius equality, for a &quot;reversible process&quot;
: formula_39

That means the line integral formula_40 is path independent for reversible processes.

So we can define a state function &quot;S&quot; called entropy, which for a reversible process or for pure heat transfer satisfies
: formula_41

With this we can only obtain the difference of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value, we need the third law of thermodynamics, which states that &quot;S&quot; = 0 at absolute zero for perfect crystals.

For any irreversible process, since entropy is a state function, we can always connect the initial and terminal states with an imaginary reversible process and integrating on that path to calculate the difference in entropy.

Now reverse the reversible process and combine it with the said irreversible process. Applying the Clausius inequality on this loop, with &quot;T&quot;surr as the temperature of the surroundings,
: formula_42

Thus,
: formula_43

where the equality holds if the transformation is reversible. If the process is an adiabatic process, then formula_44, so formula_45.

=== Energy, available useful work ===

An important and revealing idealized special case is to consider applying the second law to the scenario of an isolated system (called the total system or universe), made up of two parts: a sub-system of interest, and the sub-system&#x27;s surroundings. These surroundings are imagined to be so large that they can be considered as an &quot;unlimited&quot; heat reservoir at temperature &quot;T&quot;R and pressure &quot;P&quot;R so that no matter how much heat is transferred to (or from) the sub-system, the temperature of the surroundings will remain &quot;T&quot;R; and no matter how much the volume of the sub-system expands (or contracts), the pressure of the surroundings will remain &quot;P&quot;R.

Whatever changes to &quot;dS&quot; and &quot;dS&quot;R occur in the entropies of the sub-system and the surroundings individually, the entropy &quot;S&quot;tot of the isolated total system must not decrease according to the second law of thermodynamics:
: formula_46

According to the first law of thermodynamics, the change &quot;dU&quot; in the internal energy of the sub-system is the sum of the heat &quot;δq&quot; added to the sub-system, &quot;minus&quot; any work &quot;δw&quot; done &quot;by&quot; the sub-system, &quot;plus&quot; any net chemical energy entering the sub-system &quot;d&quot; Σ&quot;μiRNi&quot;, so that:
: formula_47
where &quot;μ&quot;&quot;iR&quot; are the chemical potentials of chemical species in the external surroundings.

Now the heat leaving the reservoir and entering the sub-system is
: formula_48
where we have first used the definition of entropy in classical thermodynamics (alternatively, in statistical thermodynamics, the relation between entropy change, temperature and absorbed heat can be derived); and then the second law inequality from above.

It therefore follows that any net work &quot;δw&quot; done by the sub-system must obey
: formula_49

It is useful to separate the work &quot;δw&quot; done by the subsystem into the &quot;useful&quot; work &quot;δwu&quot; that can be done &quot;by&quot; the sub-system, over and beyond the work &quot;pR dV&quot; done merely by the sub-system expanding against the surrounding external pressure, giving the following relation for the useful work (exergy) that can be done:
: formula_50

It is convenient to define the right-hand-side as the exact derivative of a thermodynamic potential, called the &quot;availability&quot; or &quot;exergy&quot; &quot;E&quot; of the subsystem,
: formula_51

The second law therefore implies that for any process which can be considered as divided simply into a subsystem, and an unlimited temperature and pressure reservoir with which it is in contact,
: formula_52
i.e. the change in the subsystem&#x27;s exergy plus the useful work done &quot;by&quot; the subsystem (or, the change in the subsystem&#x27;s exergy less any work, additional to that done by the pressure reservoir, done &quot;on&quot; the system) must be less than or equal to zero.

In sum, if a proper &quot;infinite-reservoir-like&quot; reference state is chosen as the system surroundings in the real world, then the second law predicts a decrease in &quot;E&quot; for an irreversible process and no change for a reversible process.
: formula_53 is equivalent to formula_52

This expression together with the associated reference state permits a design engineer working at the macroscopic scale (above the thermodynamic limit) to utilize the second law without directly measuring or considering entropy change in a total isolated system (see also &quot;Process engineer&quot;). Those changes have already been considered by the assumption that the system under consideration can reach equilibrium with the reference state without altering the reference state. An efficiency for a process or collection of processes that compares it to the reversible ideal may also be found (see &quot;Exergy efficiency&quot;).

This approach to the second law is widely utilized in engineering practice, environmental accounting, systems ecology, and other disciplines.

== Direction of spontaneous processes ==
The second law determines whether a proposed physical or chemical process is forbidden or may occur spontaneously. For isolated systems, no energy is provided by the surroundings and the second law requires that the entropy of the system alone must increase: Δ&quot;S&quot; &gt; 0. Examples of spontaneous physical processes in isolated systems include the following: 
* 1) Heat can be transferred from a region of higher temperature to a lower temperature (but not the reverse).
* 2) Mechanical energy can be converted to thermal energy (but not the reverse).
* 3) A solute can move from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration (but not the reverse).

However, for some non-isolated systems which can exchange energy with their surroundings, the surroundings exchange enough heat with the system, or do sufficient work on the system, so that the processes occur in the opposite direction. This is possible provided the total entropy change of the system plus the surroundings is positive as required by the second law: Δ&quot;S&quot;tot = Δ&quot;S&quot; + Δ&quot;S&quot;R &gt; 0. For the three examples given above:
* 1) Heat can be transferred from a region of lower temperature to a higher temperature in a refrigerator or in a heat pump. These machines must provide sufficient work to the system.
* 2) Thermal energy can be converted to mechanical work in a heat engine, if sufficient heat is also expelled to the surroundings.
* 3) A solute can move from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration in the biochemical process of active transport, if sufficient work is provided by a concentration gradient of a chemical such as ATP or by an electrochemical gradient.

=== Second law in chemical thermodynamics ===
For a spontaneous chemical process in a closed system at constant temperature and pressure without non-&quot;PV&quot; work, the Clausius inequality Δ&quot;S&quot; &gt; &quot;Q/T&quot;surr transforms into a condition for the change in Gibbs free energy
: formula_55
or d&quot;G&quot; &lt; 0. For a similar process at constant temperature and volume, the change in Helmholtz free energy must be negative, formula_56. Thus, a negative value of the change in free energy (&quot;G&quot; or &quot;A&quot;) is a necessary condition for a process to be spontaneous. This is the most useful form of the second law of thermodynamics in chemistry, where free-energy changes can be calculated from tabulated enthalpies of formation and standard molar entropies of reactants and products. The chemical equilibrium condition at constant &quot;T&quot; and &quot;p&quot; without electrical work is d&quot;G&quot; = 0.

== History ==
The first theory of the conversion of heat into mechanical work is due to Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot in 1824. He was the first to realize correctly that the efficiency of this conversion depends on the difference of temperature between an engine and its surroundings.

Recognizing the significance of James Prescott Joule&#x27;s work on the conservation of energy, Rudolf Clausius was the first to formulate the second law during 1850, in this form: heat does not flow &quot;spontaneously&quot; from cold to hot bodies. While common knowledge now, this was contrary to the caloric theory of heat popular at the time, which considered heat as a fluid. From there he was able to infer the principle of Sadi Carnot and the definition of entropy (1865).

Established during the 19th century, the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law says, &quot;It is impossible for any device that operates on a cycle to receive heat from a single reservoir and produce a net amount of work.&quot; This statement was shown to be equivalent to the statement of Clausius.

The ergodic hypothesis is also important for the Boltzmann approach. It says that, over long periods of time, the time spent in some region of the phase space of microstates with the same energy is proportional to the volume of this region, i.e. that all accessible microstates are equally probable over a long period of time. Equivalently, it says that time average and average over the statistical ensemble are the same.

There is a traditional doctrine, starting with Clausius, that entropy can be understood in terms of molecular &#x27;disorder&#x27; within a macroscopic system. This doctrine is obsolescent.

=== Account given by Clausius ===

In 1865, the German physicist Rudolf Clausius stated what he called the &quot;second fundamental theorem in the mechanical theory of heat&quot; in the following form:
: formula_57
where &quot;Q&quot; is heat, &quot;T&quot; is temperature and &quot;N&quot; is the &quot;equivalence-value&quot; of all uncompensated transformations involved in a cyclical process. Later, in 1865, Clausius would come to define &quot;equivalence-value&quot; as entropy. On the heels of this definition, that same year, the most famous version of the second law was read in a presentation at the Philosophical Society of Zurich on April 24, in which, in the end of his presentation, Clausius concludes:
The entropy of the universe tends to a maximum.

This statement is the best-known phrasing of the second law. Because of the looseness of its language, e.g. universe, as well as lack of specific conditions, e.g. open, closed, or isolated, many people take this simple statement to mean that the second law of thermodynamics applies virtually to every subject imaginable. This is not true; this statement is only a simplified version of a more extended and precise description.

In terms of time variation, the mathematical statement of the second law for an isolated system undergoing an arbitrary transformation is:
: formula_58
where
: &quot;S&quot; is the entropy of the system and
: &quot;t&quot; is time.
The equality sign applies after equilibration. An alternative way of formulating of the second law for isolated systems is:
: formula_59 with formula_60
with formula_61 the sum of the rate of entropy production by all processes inside the system. The advantage of this formulation is that it shows the effect of the entropy production. The rate of entropy production is a very important concept since it determines (limits) the efficiency of thermal machines. Multiplied with ambient temperature formula_62 it gives the so-called dissipated energy formula_63.

The expression of the second law for closed systems (so, allowing heat exchange and moving boundaries, but not exchange of matter) is:
: formula_64 with formula_60
Here,
: formula_66 is the heat flow into the system
: formula_67 is the temperature at the point where the heat enters the system.

The equality sign holds in the case that only reversible processes take place inside the system. If irreversible processes take place (which is the case in real systems in operation) the &gt;-sign holds. If heat is supplied to the system at several places we have to take the algebraic sum of the corresponding terms.

For open systems (also allowing exchange of matter):
: formula_68 with formula_60
Here, formula_70 is the flow of entropy into the system associated with the flow of matter entering the system. It should not be confused with the time derivative of the entropy. If matter is supplied at several places we have to take the algebraic sum of these contributions.

== Statistical mechanics ==

Statistical mechanics gives an explanation for the second law by postulating that a material is composed of atoms and molecules which are in constant motion. A particular set of positions and velocities for each particle in the system is called a microstate of the system and because of the constant motion, the system is constantly changing its microstate. Statistical mechanics postulates that, in equilibrium, each microstate that the system might be in is equally likely to occur, and when this assumption is made, it leads directly to the conclusion that the second law must hold in a statistical sense. That is, the second law will hold on average, with a statistical variation on the order of 1/ where &quot;N&quot; is the number of particles in the system. For everyday (macroscopic) situations, the probability that the second law will be violated is practically zero. However, for systems with a small number of particles, thermodynamic parameters, including the entropy, may show significant statistical deviations from that predicted by the second law. Classical thermodynamic theory does not deal with these statistical variations.

== Derivation from statistical mechanics ==

The first mechanical argument of the Kinetic theory of gases that molecular collisions entail an equalization of temperatures and hence a tendency towards equilibrium was due to James Clerk Maxwell in 1860; Ludwig Boltzmann with his H-theorem of 1872 also argued that due to collisions gases should over time tend toward the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution.

Due to Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox, derivations of the second law have to make an assumption regarding the past, namely that the system is uncorrelated at some time in the past; this allows for simple probabilistic treatment. This assumption is usually thought as a boundary condition, and thus the second law is ultimately a consequence of the initial conditions somewhere in the past, probably at the beginning of the universe (the Big Bang), though other scenarios have also been suggested.

Given these assumptions, in statistical mechanics, the second law is not a postulate, rather it is a consequence of the fundamental postulate, also known as the equal prior probability postulate, so long as one is clear that simple probability arguments are applied only to the future, while for the past there are auxiliary sources of information which tell us that it was low entropy. The first part of the second law, which states that the entropy of a thermally isolated system can only increase, is a trivial consequence of the equal prior probability postulate, if we restrict the notion of the entropy to systems in thermal equilibrium. The entropy of an isolated system in thermal equilibrium containing an amount of energy of formula_71 is:
: formula_72
where formula_73 is the number of quantum states in a small interval between formula_71 and formula_75. Here formula_76 is a macroscopically small energy interval that is kept fixed. Strictly speaking this means that the entropy depends on the choice of formula_76. However, in the thermodynamic limit (i.e. in the limit of infinitely large system size), the specific entropy (entropy per unit volume or per unit mass) does not depend on formula_76.

Suppose we have an isolated system whose macroscopic state is specified by a number of variables. These macroscopic variables can, e.g., refer to the total volume, the positions of pistons in the system, etc. Then formula_79 will depend on the values of these variables. If a variable is not fixed, (e.g. we do not clamp a piston in a certain position), then because all the accessible states are equally likely in equilibrium, the free variable in equilibrium will be such that formula_79 is maximized at the given energy of the isolated system as that is the most probable situation in equilibrium.

If the variable was initially fixed to some value then upon release and when the new equilibrium has been reached, the fact the variable will adjust itself so that formula_79 is maximized, implies that the entropy will have increased or it will have stayed the same (if the value at which the variable was fixed happened to be the equilibrium value).
Suppose we start from an equilibrium situation and we suddenly remove a constraint on a variable. Then right after we do this, there are a number formula_79 of accessible microstates, but equilibrium has not yet been reached, so the actual probabilities of the system being in some accessible state are not yet equal to the prior probability of formula_83. We have already seen that in the final equilibrium state, the entropy will have increased or have stayed the same relative to the previous equilibrium state. Boltzmann&#x27;s H-theorem, however, proves that the quantity increases monotonically as a function of time during the intermediate out of equilibrium state.

=== Derivation of the entropy change for reversible processes ===
The second part of the second law states that the entropy change of a system undergoing a reversible process is given by:
: formula_84
where the temperature is defined as:
: formula_85

See &quot;Microcanonical ensemble&quot; for the justification for this definition. Suppose that the system has some external parameter, &quot;x&quot;, that can be changed. In general, the energy eigenstates of the system will depend on &quot;x&quot;. According to the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics, in the limit of an infinitely slow change of the system&#x27;s Hamiltonian, the system will stay in the same energy eigenstate and thus change its energy according to the change in energy of the energy eigenstate it is in.

The generalized force, &quot;X&quot;, corresponding to the external variable &quot;x&quot; is defined such that formula_86 is the work performed by the system if &quot;x&quot; is increased by an amount &quot;dx&quot;. For example, if &quot;x&quot; is the volume, then &quot;X&quot; is the pressure. The generalized force for a system known to be in energy eigenstate formula_87 is given by:
: formula_88

Since the system can be in any energy eigenstate within an interval of formula_76, we define the generalized force for the system as the expectation value of the above expression:
: formula_90

To evaluate the average, we partition the formula_73 energy eigenstates by counting how many of them have a value for formula_92 within a range between formula_93 and formula_94. Calling this number formula_95, we have:
: formula_96

The average defining the generalized force can now be written:
: formula_97

We can relate this to the derivative of the entropy with respect to &quot;x&quot; at constant energy &quot;E&quot; as follows. Suppose we change &quot;x&quot; to &quot;x&quot; + &quot;dx&quot;. Then formula_73 will change because the energy eigenstates depend on &quot;x&quot;, causing energy eigenstates to move into or out of the range between formula_71 and formula_100. Let&#x27;s focus again on the energy eigenstates for which formula_101 lies within the range between formula_93 and formula_94. Since these energy eigenstates increase in energy by &quot;Y dx&quot;, all such energy eigenstates that are in the interval ranging from &quot;E&quot; – &quot;Y&quot; &quot;dx&quot; to &quot;E&quot; move from below &quot;E&quot; to above &quot;E&quot;. There are
: formula_104
such energy eigenstates. If formula_105, all these energy eigenstates will move into the range between formula_71 and formula_100 and contribute to an increase in formula_79. The number of energy eigenstates that move from below formula_100 to above formula_100 is given by formula_111. The difference
: formula_112
is thus the net contribution to the increase in formula_79. If &quot;Y dx&quot; is larger than formula_76 there will be the energy eigenstates that move from below &quot;E&quot; to above formula_100. They are counted in both formula_116 and formula_111, therefore the above expression is also valid in that case.

Expressing the above expression as a derivative with respect to &quot;E&quot; and summing over &quot;Y&quot; yields the expression:
: formula_118

The logarithmic derivative of formula_79 with respect to &quot;x&quot; is thus given by:
: formula_120

The first term is intensive, i.e. it does not scale with system size. In contrast, the last term scales as the inverse system size and will thus vanish in the thermodynamic limit. We have thus found that:
: formula_121

Combining this with
: formula_122
gives:
: formula_123

=== Derivation for systems described by the canonical ensemble ===
If a system is in thermal contact with a heat bath at some temperature &quot;T&quot; then, in equilibrium, the probability distribution over the energy eigenvalues are given by the canonical ensemble:
: formula_124

Here &quot;Z&quot; is a factor that normalizes the sum of all the probabilities to 1, this function is known as the partition function. We now consider an infinitesimal reversible change in the temperature and in the external parameters on which the energy levels depend. It follows from the general formula for the entropy:
: formula_125
that
: formula_126

Inserting the formula for formula_127 for the canonical ensemble in here gives:
: formula_128

=== Initial conditions at the Big Bang ===

As elaborated above, it is thought that the second law of thermodynamics is a result of the very low-entropy initial conditions at the Big Bang. From a statistical point of view, these were very special conditions. On the other hand, they were quite simple, as the universe - or at least the part thereof from which the observable universe developed - seems to have been extremely uniform.

This may seem somewhat paradoxical, since in many physical systems uniform conditions (e.g. mixed rather than separated gases) have high entropy. The paradox is solved once realizing that gravitational systems have negative heat capacity, so that when gravity is important, uniform conditions (e.g. gas of uniform density) in fact have lower entropy compared to non-uniform ones (e.g. black holes in empty space). Yet another approach is that the universe had high (or even maximal) entropy given its size, but as the universe grew it rapidly came out of thermodynamic equilibrium, its entropy only slightly increased compared to the increase in maximal possible entropy, and thus it has arrived at a very low entropy when compared to the much larger possible maximum given its later size.

As for the reason why initial conditions were such, one suggestion is that cosmological inflation was enough to wipe off non-smoothness, while another is that the universe was created spontaneously where the mechanism of creation implies low-entropy initial conditions.

== Living organisms ==
There are two principal ways of formulating thermodynamics, (a) through passages from one state of thermodynamic equilibrium to another, and (b) through cyclic processes, by which the system is left unchanged, while the total entropy of the surroundings is increased. These two ways help to understand the processes of life. The thermodynamics of living organisms has been considered by many authors, including Erwin Schrödinger (in his book &quot;What is Life?&quot;) and Léon Brillouin.

To a fair approximation, living organisms may be considered as examples of (b). Approximately, an animal&#x27;s physical state cycles by the day, leaving the animal nearly unchanged. Animals take in food, water, and oxygen, and, as a result of metabolism, give out breakdown products and heat. Plants take in radiative energy from the sun, which may be regarded as heat, and carbon dioxide and water. They give out oxygen. In this way they grow. Eventually they die, and their remains rot away, turning mostly back into carbon dioxide and water. This can be regarded as a cyclic process. Overall, the sunlight is from a high temperature source, the sun, and its energy is passed to a lower temperature sink, i.e. radiated into space. This is an increase of entropy of the surroundings of the plant. Thus animals and plants obey the second law of thermodynamics, considered in terms of cyclic processes.

Furthermore, the ability of living organisms to grow and increase in complexity, as well as to form correlations with their environment in the form of adaption and memory, is not opposed to the second law – rather, it is akin to general results following from it: Under some definitions, an increase in entropy also results in an increase in complexity, and for a finite system interacting with finite reservoirs, an increase in entropy is equivalent to an increase in correlations between the system and the reservoirs.

Living organisms may be considered as open systems, because matter passes into and out from them. Thermodynamics of open systems is currently often considered in terms of passages from one state of thermodynamic equilibrium to another, or in terms of flows in the approximation of local thermodynamic equilibrium. The problem for living organisms may be further simplified by the approximation of assuming a steady state with unchanging flows. General principles of entropy production for such approximations are a subject of ongoing research.

== Gravitational systems ==
Commonly, systems for which gravity is not important have a positive heat capacity, meaning that their temperature rises with their internal energy. Therefore, when energy flows from a high-temperature object to a low-temperature object, the source temperature decreases while the sink temperature is increased; hence temperature differences tend to diminish over time.

This is not always the case for systems in which the gravitational force is important: systems that are bound by their own gravity, such as stars, can have negative heat capacities. As they contract, both their total energy and their entropy decrease but their internal temperature may increase. This can be significant for protostars and even gas giant planets such as Jupiter. When the entropy of the black-body radiation emitted by the bodies is included, however, the total entropy of the system can be shown to increase even as the entropy of the planet or star decreases.

== Non-equilibrium states ==

The theory of classical or equilibrium thermodynamics is idealized. A main postulate or assumption, often not even explicitly stated, is the existence of systems in their own internal states of thermodynamic equilibrium. In general, a region of space containing a physical system at a given time, that may be found in nature, is not in thermodynamic equilibrium, read in the most stringent terms. In looser terms, nothing in the entire universe is or has ever been truly in exact thermodynamic equilibrium.

For purposes of physical analysis, it is often enough convenient to make an assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium. Such an assumption may rely on trial and error for its justification. If the assumption is justified, it can often be very valuable and useful because it makes available the theory of thermodynamics. Elements of the equilibrium assumption are that a system is observed to be unchanging over an indefinitely long time, and that there are so many particles in a system, that its particulate nature can be entirely ignored. Under such an equilibrium assumption, in general, there are no macroscopically detectable fluctuations. There is an exception, the case of critical states, which exhibit to the naked eye the phenomenon of critical opalescence. For laboratory studies of critical states, exceptionally long observation times are needed.

In all cases, the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium, once made, implies as a consequence that no putative candidate &quot;fluctuation&quot; alters the entropy of the system.

It can easily happen that a physical system exhibits internal macroscopic changes that are fast enough to invalidate the assumption of the constancy of the entropy. Or that a physical system has so few particles that the particulate nature is manifest in observable fluctuations. Then the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium is to be abandoned. There is no unqualified general definition of entropy for non-equilibrium states.

There are intermediate cases, in which the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium is a very good approximation, but strictly speaking it is still an approximation, not theoretically ideal.

For non-equilibrium situations in general, it may be useful to consider statistical mechanical definitions of other quantities that may be conveniently called &#x27;entropy&#x27;, but they should not be confused or conflated with thermodynamic entropy properly defined for the second law. These other quantities indeed belong to statistical mechanics, not to thermodynamics, the primary realm of the second law.

The physics of macroscopically observable fluctuations is beyond the scope of this article.

== Arrow of time ==
The second law of thermodynamics is a physical law that is not symmetric to reversal of the time direction. This does not conflict with symmetries observed in the fundamental laws of physics (particularly CPT symmetry) since the second law applies statistically on time-asymmetric boundary conditions. The second law has been related to the difference between moving forwards and backwards in time, or to the principle that cause precedes effect (the causal arrow of time, or causality).

== Irreversibility ==
Irreversibility in thermodynamic processes is a consequence of the asymmetric character of thermodynamic operations, and not of any internally irreversible microscopic properties of the bodies. Thermodynamic operations are macroscopic external interventions imposed on the participating bodies, not derived from their internal properties. There are reputed &quot;paradoxes&quot; that arise from failure to recognize this.

=== Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox ===

Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox, also known as the reversibility paradox, is the objection that it should not be possible to deduce an irreversible process from the time-symmetric dynamics that describe the microscopic evolution of a macroscopic system.

In the opinion of Schrödinger, &quot;It is now quite obvious in what manner you have to reformulate the law of entropyor for that matter, all other irreversible statementsso that they be capable of being derived from reversible models. You must not speak of one isolated system but at least of two, which you may for the moment consider isolated from the rest of the world, but not always from each other.&quot; The two systems are isolated from each other by the wall, until it is removed by the thermodynamic operation, as envisaged by the law. The thermodynamic operation is externally imposed, not subject to the reversible microscopic dynamical laws that govern the constituents of the systems. It is the cause of the irreversibility. The statement of the law in this present article complies with Schrödinger&#x27;s advice. The cause–effect relation is logically prior to the second law, not derived from it. This reaffirms Albert Einstein&#x27;s postulates that cornerstone Special and General Relativity - that the flow of time is irreversible, however it is relative. Cause must precede effect, but only within the constraints as defined explicitly within General Relativity (or Special Relativity, depending on the local spacetime conditions). Good examples of this are the Ladder Paradox, time dilation and length contraction exhibited by objects approaching the velocity of light or within proximity of a super-dense region of mass/energy - e.g. black holes, neutron stars, magnetars and quasars.

=== Poincaré recurrence theorem ===

The Poincaré recurrence theorem considers a theoretical microscopic description of an isolated physical system. This may be considered as a model of a thermodynamic system after a thermodynamic operation has removed an internal wall. The system will, after a sufficiently long time, return to a microscopically defined state very close to the initial one. The Poincaré recurrence time is the length of time elapsed until the return. It is exceedingly long, likely longer than the life of the universe, and depends sensitively on the geometry of the wall that was removed by the thermodynamic operation. The recurrence theorem may be perceived as apparently contradicting the second law of thermodynamics. More obviously, however, it is simply a microscopic model of thermodynamic equilibrium in an isolated system formed by removal of a wall between two systems. For a typical thermodynamical system, the recurrence time is so large (many many times longer than the lifetime of the universe) that, for all practical purposes, one cannot observe the recurrence. One might wish, nevertheless, to imagine that one could wait for the Poincaré recurrence, and then re-insert the wall that was removed by the thermodynamic operation. It is then evident that the appearance of irreversibility is due to the utter unpredictability of the Poincaré recurrence given only that the initial state was one of thermodynamic equilibrium, as is the case in macroscopic thermodynamics. Even if one could wait for it, one has no practical possibility of picking the right instant at which to re-insert the wall. The Poincaré recurrence theorem provides a solution to Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox. If an isolated thermodynamic system could be monitored over increasingly many multiples of the average Poincaré recurrence time, the thermodynamic behavior of the system would become invariant under time reversal.

=== Maxwell&#x27;s demon ===
James Clerk Maxwell imagined one container divided into two parts, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Both parts are filled with the same gas at equal temperatures and placed next to each other, separated by a wall. Observing the molecules on both sides, an imaginary demon guards a microscopic trapdoor in the wall. When a faster-than-average molecule from &quot;A&quot; flies towards the trapdoor, the demon opens it, and the molecule will fly from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;. The average speed of the molecules in &quot;B&quot; will have increased while in &quot;A&quot; they will have slowed down on average. Since average molecular speed corresponds to temperature, the temperature decreases in &quot;A&quot; and increases in &quot;B&quot;, contrary to the second law of thermodynamics.

One response to this question was suggested in 1929 by Leó Szilárd and later by Léon Brillouin. Szilárd pointed out that a real-life Maxwell&#x27;s demon would need to have some means of measuring molecular speed, and that the act of acquiring information would require an expenditure of energy. Likewise, Brillouin demonstrated that the decrease in entropy caused by the demon would be less than the entropy produced by choosing molecules based on their speed.

Maxwell&#x27;s &#x27;demon&#x27; repeatedly alters the permeability of the wall between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. It is therefore performing thermodynamic operations on a microscopic scale, not just observing ordinary spontaneous or natural macroscopic thermodynamic processes.

<text>Black Creek Township is a township in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,904 as of the 2020 census.

==History==
Black Creek Township was established from a section of Sugarloaf Township on August 8, 1848. It was named after Black Creek (a stream which runs through the township).

The township grew slowly during its early years. Farmers had to clear away thick forests in order to utilize the land. The early lumbermen were also busy cutting down the forests which blanketed the mountainous landscape. The first sawmill and gristmill were built by Martin and William Rittenhouse in 1810.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.45%, is water. The township is south of PA 93 (originally the Lehigh-Susquehanna Turnpike). It is also west of the Interstate 80—Interstate 81 interchange. I-80 runs through the northern portion of the township. It cuts through a mountain pass (which was formed by Nescopeck Creek).

Black Creek Township is crossed by a series of east-to-west mountains. Small farming communities are scattered throughout the many valleys which make up the township. Some of the township&#x27;s villages are Mountain Grove, Rock Glen, and Weston. The small farming community of Nuremberg is partially located in Black Creek Township (Luzerne County) and North Union Township (Schuylkill County).

<text>Butler Township is a township in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 9,469 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
===Founding===

The township is named after Col. Zebulon Butler; he is most famous for his action at the Battle of Wyoming, which resulted in his defeat by British-allied forces. Butler lost 340 men while attacking a superior force of Loyalists and Iroquois. In 1839, Butler Township was formed from a section of Sugarloaf Township. The southern portion of Butler Township was transferred over to Hazle Township in 1861.

===Drums Village===
==== 18th century====
Drums is an unincorporated community in Butler Township. The village was named after the Drum family, whose members developed the village&#x27;s first school, post office, hotels, churches, roads, and businesses. Family members held positions as pioneers, land developers, justices of the peace, postmasters, school presidents, educators, tailors, shoe makers, hotel proprietors, lawyers, and Pennsylvania state legislators.

In 1738, Philip Drum, aged 36, immigrated to America from Germany with his eight-year-old son Jacob. In 1749, Jacob married Catharine Strauss, who gave birth to a son, George, on June 12, 1762, in Williams Township, Northampton County. According to the 1790 United States Federal Census, George Drum lived in &quot;Allen Township&quot; (now West Bethlehem) during the 1790s before moving his family to the Nescopeck Valley (now Sugarloaf Valley). While in the valley, he established a hotel business and eventually established the towns of Drums and Conyngham.

==== 19th century ====
In 1808, Philip Drum (son of George Sr.) bought land in Luzerne County from Benjamin Rush, who was a close advisor to George Washington during the American Revolutionary War and signed the United States Declaration of Independence. In 1810, Philip established Drums&#x27; first carding mill on the Little Nescopeck River. In addition, Philip established the first wool-processing mill in 1835; it was located a short distance from the carding mill. In 1814, George&#x27;s second son, George Jr. (born October 16, 1792), bought land next to his brother Philip. Philip bought additional land in 1814, 1826, 1836, and 1847. George Sr., George Jr., Philip, and other Drum family members owned vast acreage of land in Drums, Conyngham, and surrounding counties. George Drum&#x27;s two century old estate still stands in immaculate condition in Conyngham and is a fine example of colonial architecture. George Sr. and George Jr. both died in 1831. On February 27, 1858, Philip died at the age of 71 in Drums, Butler Township.

Further community and land development by family members made Drums and St. Johns the commercial centers of Butler Township. Drums is the principal village of the township.

<text>Conyngham is a borough in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,820 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

The first settler of Conyngham was George Drum (in the late 1700s) who served in the American Revolution and was elected justice of the peace in 1811. George Drum was an entrepreneurial businessman and was a large landowner who also owned the Drums Hotel, a shoe shop, tavern, and the Drums Post Office. He and his family developed the adjacent village of Drums, of which the village is named after the family, along with helping the development of Conyngham. Drums is a sister village to Conyngham. The George Drum residence remains standing in impeccable condition on Conyngham&#x27;s Main Street.

The Sugarloaf Massacre of September 11, 1780, was one of a series of bloody engagements fought in the frontier of northeastern Pennsylvania between Iroquois (allies of British troops) and settlers loyal to the cause of American independence. Today, this event is commemorated by a historic monument with a bronze plaque bearing the names of the fifteen men who lost their lives near modern-day Conyngham.

In 1815, Redmond Conyngham represented Luzerne County in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. In 1820, he served a term in the State Senate. Captain Gustavus Conyngham was his cousin. He was an unsung hero of the Revolution. He commanded a privateer and was the first to carry the American flag in the English Channel. The townspeople suggested naming the village after Redmond Conyngham, but he replied that the town should be named in honor of his cousin, Gustavus, who frequently made trips to England to obtain military supplies for revolutionary colonists.

In the 1800s, the Lehigh-Susquehanna Turnpike traveled through the middle of modern-day Main Street in Conyngham. PA 93 was later constructed as another route through the town. It was not until 1921 when Conyngham became a borough.

==Geography==

Conyngham is located at (40.990051, -76.061655).

Coal mining and silk manufacturing were the chief industries in Duryea&#x27;s early years. The population was 5,032 at the 2020 census.

==History==
===Early history===
The area now known as Duryea Borough was historically the heartland of the Susquehannock tribe, also called the Conestoga, which were an Iroquoian people whose territory extended from lower New York State to the Potomac. The Susquehannock befriended the Dutch traders by 1612, who soon began trading tools and firearms for furs. The Dutch had established their trading posts along the rivers near where two natural Indian trails allowed them to make contact with the Conestoga— these were the sometimes disputed lands of the Susquehannocks and the rival Delaware nation (Lenape people).
The Dutch, while buying the lands for their settlements on the Hudson and Delaware in Lenape lands, soon developed frictions with their hosts and eventually formed an alliance with the more warlike and fierce Susquehannocks. In the 1630s, the Susquehannocks and the Lenape people warred. In 1642, the British Province of Maryland declared war on the Susquehannocks and over eight mostly inconsequential years of warfare, while the Dutch allied themselves with the Susquehannocks, lost it to the Dutch and the Indians.

A few years later, the English Sea Power defeated the Dutch ending their continued influence in North America. The Conestoga continued to grow in strength. In the 1660s, the area supported a military conquest which greatly weakened two of the western Iroquois tribes: the Seneca and Catagua. They were also struck by three years of plague (around 1670) in which 9 out of 10 Susquehannocks died. In the next few years, renewed war with the Iroquois kept the tribe from recovering and only a pale remnant of its strength relocated to the plains area now between Harrisburg and Philadelphia, where they came to deal with William Penn and the new colonial Province of Pennsylvania.

===Establishment===
Forty original settlers arrived from Connecticut on February 8, 1769, and set up temporary cabins near the confluence of the Lackawanna and Susquehanna rivers, the area now at the southern end of Duryea Borough. One of the first settlers was Zebulon Marcy, from whom Marcy Township got its name. He built the first log cabin in 1770 on the west side of Duryea&#x27;s present-day Main Street (not far from the Old Forge line). As more settlers located in the area, the development of mining caused the citizenry to petition for township status. Marcy Township was founded in 1880 with a population of 1,159. A census of the township in 1894 noted a population of 2,396 and 475 dwellings in a settlement. By the 1890s, the area was called Duryea. 
Duryea grew in population and listed 1,005 registered voters in 1901, when it petitioned for reorganization as a Pennsylvania borough. The Borough of Duryea was incorporated on May 28, 1901; it was named in honor of Hiram Duryea, an American Civil War general and owner of extensive tracts of land in sections of the country. He was a prominent figure in the starch industry, a coal operator, and an official of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. It was the practice of this railroad to name its section stops after officials of the line, hence the name of Duryea. In one sense, like many communities in the country, the town is named after its railroad station.

===Coal mining===
Farming was the principal occupation in the early days. Pioneer settlers found many portions of the land suitable for raising food that they needed for existence. Shortly after, mining would become the area&#x27;s greatest source of prosperity, along with silk mills and stone quarries.

Three large colliers once operated around Duryea. As in other nearby communities, the coal was often mined directly under the town itself. Remnants of strip mines and culm banks still litter the landscape to this day. After the Knox Mine Disaster (1959), which occurred only several miles outside of Duryea, the mining industry in the Wyoming Valley collapsed.

After the death of coal and the loss of the silk mill, the town encouraged the likes of Schott Optical and Topps Bubble Gum to establish medium-sized plants in the town. However, these would never replace the jobs and revenue provided by coal. The borough witnessed a declining population along with a shrinking enrollment within its schools. This resulted in the takeover of the town&#x27;s schools by the Pittston Area School District. The remaining neighborhood schools were eventually phased out and shut down with Duryea Elementary being shut down in 1981.

===Early 21st century===
The Reading &amp; Northern Railroad Company invested in Duryea Yard (or Muller yard) in late 2009 and early 2010, laying track to accommodate 100 new rail cars and constructing a facility to store and hold up to 800 cars of sand to be used in hydraulic fracturing, or &quot;fracking,&quot; operations at Marcellus Shale drill sites throughout northeastern Pennsylvania. There is a sand quarry operating just north of the borough limits along a line once traversed by rails leaving the yard during its heyday.

In September 2011, Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee caused severe flooding in the borough. It destroyed many homes and businesses along the Lackawanna River in Duryea, stretching from Phoenix Street to Elm Street. In the following days, Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator Bob Casey visited the devastated sections of Duryea.

Also in 2011, the borough received national attention for its role in the landmark Supreme Court case &quot;Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri&quot;, in which the court stated that &quot;a government employer&#x27;s allegedly retaliatory actions against an employee do not give rise to liability under the Petition Clause unless the employee&#x27;s petition relates to a matter of public concern.&quot;

==Geography==
The Borough of Duryea is located at (41.347729, -75.758302). The borough is located on the eastern bank of the Susquehanna River in northern Luzerne County. The Lackawanna River, which flows through the middle of Duryea, joins the Susquehanna on its eastern bank. Most of the borough&#x27;s homes and businesses are located just south of the Lackawanna, while most of the land north of the river is forested mountains (e.g., Campbell&#x27;s Ledge). Interstate 81 and U.S. Route 11 run through the easternmost section of Duryea. The borough is also part of Pittston Area School District.

It is located on the western bank of the Susquehanna River and has a total area of . As of the 2020 United States Census, Exeter had a population of 5,513.

==History==

The name Exeter derives from the ancient city of Exeter in Devon, England. Numerous other places in Canada and the United States have also been given the same name.

In 1769, settlers from Connecticut began making their homes in the Wyoming Valley of Northeastern Pennsylvania but came into conflict with settlers from Pennsylvania during the Pennamite–Yankee Wars.

In early July 1778, during the Revolutionary War, a large-scale raid by Butler&#x27;s Rangers and their Iroquois allies entered the valley. Fort Wintermoot (in present-day Exeter) and Fort Jenkins (in present-day West Pittston) quickly surrendered and were later burned to the ground. On July 3, 1778, about three hundred Patriot militia and Continentals died at the Battle of Wyoming, also known as the Wyoming Massacre, which took place in present-day Exeter and Wyoming.

Exeter was founded a fertile agricultural area—once the heartland of the Susquehannock people. Much lumbering and coal-mining was carried out in the area in the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 1830s, the region entered a boom period and began shipping coal by the Pennsylvania Canal, and by the 1840s down the Lehigh Canal to Allentown, Philadelphia, Trenton, Wilmington, New York City, and other East Coast cities and ports. This was done by the connecting engineering works of the Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company. These works included the upper Lehigh Canal, the Ashley Planes, the early Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad (L&amp;S), and other railroads in the area.

After severe flooding ripped up the upper Lehigh Canal in the 1860s, the L&amp;S was extended to the Delaware along the lower canal, keeping the markets of the big cities connected to the still growing Wyoming Valley collieries and breakers. A second rail line was pushed up the Lehigh Gorge (the Lehigh Valley Railroad), enabling the resurgence of coal exportation to the East Coast cities; it also connected the region to the Erie Railroad and Buffalo, New York.

Exeter was incorporated as a borough in 1884. By 1900, the population consisted of 1,948 citizens. The town lost usable lands in the 1959 Knox Mine Disaster, when the river broke through and flooded the local mines. This essentially shut down the coal mining industry in and around Exeter. Subsequently, despite the local loss of industry, the fact that the population was 5,652 at the 2010 census indicates that the former farmlands have been attractive to building developers.
