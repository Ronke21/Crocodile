A local landmark, the Tunkhannock Viaduct, Tunkhannock Creek Viaduct or &quot;Nicholson Bridge&quot; has been a focal point of the Nicholson community since its completion in 1915. Built by the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad between 1912 and 1915, the bridge has served many owners: DL&amp;W, Erie Lackawanna, Conrail, Delaware &amp; Hudson [also operated by Guilford Transportation, and New York Susquehanna &amp; Western] before the current owner, Norfolk Southern Railway. Norfolk Southern trains operate over it daily between Binghamton and several other New York state locations, along with rail yards in Pennsylvania such as Scranton, Allentown and Harrisburg. Each year the town organizes a festival in honor of the bridge called Nicholson Bridge Day. The entire main street of the town is shut down and filled with vendors, entertainment, and more.

==History and landmarks==

Delta is at the heart of the Peach Bottom Slate Region. Slate quarries opened in Delta in the 1840s, and quarrymen arrived from Wales. At the Crystal Palace Exposition of 1850, Peach Bottom slate was judged the finest in the world. Most of Delta&#x27;s houses still have slate roofs, and remnants of the original blue-black slate sidewalks still exist throughout the borough.

The Peach Bottom Railway entered Delta in 1876, and shipped slate along its line to Red Lion and York, Pennsylvania. From the south, the Maryland Central Railroad reached Delta in 1883 and began operating trains from Delta to Bel Air, Maryland and Baltimore in 1884. Both lines were later succeeded by the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad, which operated until 1978. The slate quarry was a major freight customer until 1971, when Delta’s Funkhouser Quarry closed.

The Rehoboth Welsh Chapel in Delta is a non-denominational Christian church that holds services in Welsh and English. Its Welsh choir has won a prize at the highly competitive National Eisteddfod of Wales and performed at the wedding of Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones.

The Delta Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

==Notable people==

* Thomas Dale Stewart, (1901–1997), forensic anthropologist, Smithsonian Institution

==History==

James Joner purchased in 1764 and laid out the town of Dover. It was known generally as Joner&#x27;s Town until 1815, when a Dover post office was established.

During the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign of the American Civil War, Dover was briefly occupied overnight, June 30 – July 1, by Confederate cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart.

Dover was incorporated in 1864, 100 years after its founding.

The Englehart Melchinger House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

==Geography==
Dover is located in York County at (40.003846, -76.849397), northwest of the county seat of York. The borough is entirely surrounded by Dover Township.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

The racial makeup of the borough was 96.47% White, 1.05% African American, 0.39% Native American, 0.83% Asian, 0.72% from other races, and 0.55% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.43% of the population.

There were 770 households, out of which 30.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47.9% were married couples living together, 10.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.4% were non-families. 28.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.34 and the average family size was 2.90.

In the borough the population was spread out, with 23.7% under the age of 18, 11.6% from 18 to 24, 30.8% from 25 to 44, 23.7% from 45 to 64, and 10.1% who were 65 years of age or older.

About 4.3% of families and 6.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.5% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

==Education==

Dover&#x27;s public schools are operated by the Dover Area School District.

==Intelligent design controversy==
Dover received national attention in 2004–05, after the Dover Area School District voted to include the following statement about intelligent design in the biology curriculum of its schools:
:The Pennsylvania Academic Standards require students to learn about Darwin&#x27;s Theory of Evolution and eventually to take a standardized test of which evolution is a part.

:Because Darwin&#x27;s theory is a theory, it continues to be tested as new evidence is discovered. The theory is not a fact. Gaps in the theory exist for which there is no evidence.

:A theory is defined as a well-tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observations.

:Intelligent Design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwin&#x27;s view. The reference book &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot; is available for students who might be interested in gaining an understanding of what Intelligent Design actually involves.

:With respect to any theory, students are encouraged to keep an open mind. The school leaves the discussion of the Origins of Life to individual students and their families. As a Standards-driven district, class instruction focuses upon preparing students to achieve proficiency on Standards-based assessments.

===Aftermath===
The controversial statement by the school board triggered the court case &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot; in late 2005. The case was resolved on December 20, 2005, when Judge John E. Jones III ruled that the Dover Area School District cannot teach Intelligent Design in a science class room, due to its religious origins. The separation of church and state principle, as derived from the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, prohibits any government agency from endorsing religious points of view.

In an upset election on November 8, 2005, the eight Republican school board members who voted for the language were all defeated by the challengers from the Dover Cares slate—four Democrats and four Republicans, forced by election rules to run on the Democratic ticket—who opposed the teaching of intelligent design in a science class.

Over the past few years Dover has incorporated a Comparative Religion course as an elective for students who want to learn more about all the religions of the world.

===Pat Robertson===
Two days after the upset, Pat Robertson commented on the election results on &quot;The 700 Club&quot;:
:I&#x27;d like to say to the good citizens of Dover: If there is a disaster in your area, don&#x27;t turn to God. You just rejected Him from your city.
He later revisited his previous warning:
:God is tolerant and loving, but we can&#x27;t keep sticking our finger in His eye forever. If they have future problems in Dover, I recommend they call on Charles Darwin. Maybe he can help them.

<text>East York is a census-designated place (CDP) in York County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 8,777 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
East York is located within Springettsbury Township just east of the city of York.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

==History==
The suburb of East York was developed in 1903 with the foresight that industrial expansion would attract a great increase in population. John H. Longstreet&#x27;s vision foresaw the pathway of expansion.

Many beautiful homes were soon built and more building lots awaited new owners.

Known to many as the Keesey Tract, the East York area was listed as &quot;fronting, for two-thirds of a mile, on both sides of Market Street, York&#x27;s main thoroughfare, and part of the Great Lincoln Highway.&quot; Only an eleven-minute ride from Center Square in York, it featured high ground with perfect natural drainage, cement walks and curbs, macadamized streets, pure filtered water, electric lights, and a complete sewer system.

The York Railways Company lines ran the entire length of Market Street through the center of the tract and to adjoining boroughs. For a single carfare, one could ride the entire length of Market Street.

The East York area offered its members all the privileges of an up-to-date club. Any resident could be member and enjoy its privileges, including dining services, games, lawn tennis, and the entire social advantages attendant thereto. The club&#x27;s privileges were also open to members&#x27; families.

On East Market Street and nearby stood the area residences of George L. Stallman, Charles E. Tucker, Mahlon N. Haines, Congressman E.S. Brooks, Professor C.B. Heinly, Cleaver and Merrihew, William J. Gribben, E. P. Minnich, Dr. J.E. Barrick, and Sarah J. Mitzel.

The East York Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Hiestand School===

In 1912, the John S. Hiestand School was built in the area on land donated by John S. Longstreet. This school was built in what was then the Independent School District. A graded school, managed by a progressive Board of Directors, its students were taught by competent teachers in all grades from first to eighth and prepared for entrance into York High School.

There, tuition was paid for by the Independent School District under an agreement with the city school board.

The first consideration in designing and erecting the building was the children&#x27;s welfare. The building was located in the center of ample playgrounds, had two classrooms, boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; cloakrooms, functional toilets, and large basement playrooms for use in bad weather. The school, where all students and residents could obtain free use of well-selected books, also maintained a public library.

The original two classrooms were doubled to four in 1927 and there were six rooms by 1937. The Hiestand School was closed in June 1978 for financial reasons and due to declining enrollment, and has been used subsequently by various community organizations.

<text>Damnation (from Latin &quot;damnatio&quot;) is the concept of divine punishment and torment in an afterlife for sins that were committed, or in some cases, good actions not done on Earth.

In Ancient Egyptian religious tradition, it was believed that citizens would recite the 42 negative confessions of Maat as their heart was weighed against the feather of truth. If the citizen&#x27;s heart was heavier than the feather, it was said that it would be devoured by Ammit.

Zoroastrianism developed an eschatological concept of a Last Judgment called Frashokereti where the dead will be raised and the righteous wade through a river of milk while the wicked will be burned in a river of molten metal.

Abrahamic religions such as Christianity have similar concepts of humans facing judgement after death to determine if they will spend eternity in Gehenna for their sin or eternity in heaven. A damned human &quot;in damnation&quot; is said to be either in hell, or living in a state wherein they are divorced from Heaven and/or in a state of disgrace from God&#x27;s favor.

Following the religious meaning, the words damn and goddamn are a common form of religious profanity, in modern times often semantically weakened to the status of interjections.

==Etymology==
Classical Latin means &quot;damage, cost, expense; penalty, fine&quot;, ultimately from a PIE root &quot;*dap-&quot;. The verb &quot;damnare&quot; in Roman law acquired a legal meaning of &quot;to pronounce judgement upon&quot;.

The word entered Middle English usage from Old French in the early 14th century.
The secular meaning survives in English &quot;to condemn&quot; (in a court of law), or &quot;damning criticism&quot;. The noun &quot;damnation&quot; itself is mostly reserved for the religious sense in Modern English, while &quot;condemnation&quot; remains common in secular usage.

During the 18th century and until about 1930, the use of &quot;damn&quot; as an expletive was considered a severe profanity and was mostly avoided in print. The expression &quot;not worth a damn&quot; was recorded in 1802. The use of &quot;damn&quot; as an adjective, short for &quot;damned&quot;, was recorded in 1775. &quot;Damn Yankee&quot; (a Southern US term for &quot;Northerner&quot;) dates back to 1812.

==Christianity==

In most forms of Western Christian belief, damnation to hell is what humanity deserves for its sins. Catholic and many Protestant denominations hold that human sin is the product of the fall of man of Adam and Eve in the Book of Genesis. In some Christian denominations, only the sins that the Ten Commandments describe cause damnation, but others apply more strict terms. The reasons for being damned have varied widely through the centuries, with little consistency between different forms of Christianity (i.e., Catholic or Protestant). &quot;Sins&quot; ranging from murder to dancing have been said to lead to damnation.

Christian denominations have differing views on soteriology, but a mainstream view is that believers can only escape damnation by salvation through Jesus Christ. One conception is of suffering and denial of entrance to Heaven, often described in the Book of Revelation as burning in a Lake of Fire. Another conception, derived from the scripture about &quot;Gehenna&quot;, is simply that people will be discarded (burned), as being unworthy of preservation by God.

Opinions in the Eastern Orthodox church differ on this subject matter. Question 383 of the Philaret Drozdov catechism asks: &quot;What will be the lot of unbelievers and transgressors? Answer: They will be given over to everlasting deaththat is, to everlasting fire, to everlasting torment, with the devils. Proof: Whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. Rev. xx. 15. And, That is the second death. Rev. xx. 14. Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. Matt. xxv. 41. And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal. Matt. xxv 46. It is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire: where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. Mark ix. 47, 48.&quot;

However some view sin in less legalistic sense, but more as a spiritual illness that needs to be cured and purged. It is seen as a state of opposition to the love of God, a state into which all humans are born but against which Jesus Christ is the Mediator and Redeemer. Eastern traditions have established their views on Paradise and Gehenna from theologians like Isaac of Nineveh and Basil of Caesarea and the Fathers of the Church. According to Orthodoxy, Heaven and Hell are relations to or experiences of God&#x27;s just and loving presence, with often used analogy being how Sun melts wax and hardens the clay, with different reactions to sunlight depending not on sun but the matter that reacts to it. Similarly, Saints enjoy the loving presence of God, while the damned are enraged by it. In the Eastern Orthodox tradition theologians can describe God by presenting negative descriptions of what God is not, and describe Gehenna in similar ways. Marcion of Sinope was deemed heretical for teaching that the holy figures of the Old Testament were damned to hell while sinners would receive salvation.

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism, one of the three main acharyas, Acharya Madhva or Madhvacharya differed significantly from traditional Hindu beliefs owing to his concept of eternal damnation. For example, he divides souls into three classes. One class of souls, &quot;mukti-yogyas&quot;, qualifies for liberation, another, the &quot;nitya-samsarins&quot;, subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration and a third class, &quot;tamo-yogyas&quot;, who are condemned to eternal hell (&quot;Andhatamas&quot;), since their guilt cannot be obliterated according to him. No other Hindu philosopher or school of Hinduism holds such beliefs. In contrast, most Hindus believe in universal salvation, that all souls will eventually obtain moksha, even if after millions of rebirths.

==As profanity==
&quot;Damn&quot; is nowadays a mildly profane word for some people in English, although &quot;God damn&quot; (or &quot;Goddamn&quot;) may be considered blasphemous by the religiously devout, who regard it as a violation of the commandment against taking God&#x27;s name in vain. &quot;Dang&quot; (mainly US) or &quot;darn&quot; are common euphemisms, specifically minced oaths, for &quot;damn&quot;. The profanity of &quot;damn&quot; and its derivatives (e.g. &quot;damned&quot;, &quot;damnation&quot;) is effectively limited to cases where the word is not used in its literal meaning, e.g., &quot;The damned dog won&#x27;t stop barking!&quot; (but the line of Arthur Miller&#x27;s character John Proctor to his servant, &quot;God damns all liars&quot; uses the word in its literal sense and has not been seen as objectionable). Use of the word or its derivatives in their figurative forms may impact on the ratings of movies and television programmes.

In Indian English, there is an incorrect etymology connecting &quot;I don&#x27;t give a damn&quot; with the dam, a 16th-century copper coin. Salman Rushdie, in a 1985 essay on the dictionary of Anglo-Indian terms &quot;Hobson-Jobson&quot;, ends with this: Frankly, my dear, I don&#x27;t give a small copper coin weighing one tolah, eight mashas and seven surkhs, being the fortieth part of a rupee.&#x27; Or, to put it more concisely, a dam.&quot;

==History==
Originally settled by the English Quakers from Chester County as early as 1730, and German immigrants from the York and Hanover areas in the late 18th century, much of the land now encompassed by Fairview Township was part of Pennsborough Township, Lancaster County. York County, when separated from Lancaster in 1749, had no definitely established northern boundary. In 1751, after the formation of Cumberland from Lancaster County, the Provincial Assembly passed a special act making Yellow Breeches Creek the official boundary between counties. At that time, the lands in this area were annexed to Newberry Township, where they remained until February 1803, when the York County Court approved petitions of area citizens to create the Township of Fairview.

In the mid-18th century, the area known as New Market was owned by John Harris, founding father of Harrisburg and a trader with the large Shawnee Indian settlement at the mouth of Yellow Breeches Creek. By 1806, the area boasted several churches, stores, a working forge, and a distillery. The growth of this particular portion of the township was due, in large part, to the establishment of a ferry across the Susquehanna River and the York-Harrisburg Road, which passed through the area. In 1807, a 120-lot village was laid out, and lots were sold by lottery drawing held at the local tavern. The owner of the New Market Forge, Jacob Haldeman Sr., who also had a working forge in Lisburn (thus, Forge Road), was responsible for laying out the town of New Cumberland in 1814, and selling the lots with the same lottery method used for New Market.

Fairview Township began as an agricultural area, with only a small amount of industry and trade. Because of its primary agricultural base, township population growth was very slow after the initial settlement. The first census count in 1820 was 1,764. Eighty years later, in 1900, the number reached 2,042, an increase of only 278. By 1950, it had more than doubled to 5,514, and 1990 figures showed the township population at 13,258. The development of better highway systems and the suburban growth of the Harrisburg area have greatly changed portions of the township over the last 50 years.

The Ashton-Hursh House and Etters Bridge are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Infrastructure==
Capital City Airport (currently used by general aviation; formerly Harrisburg&#x27;s principal airport) and the New Cumberland Army Depot both lie in Fairview Township.

<text>Glen Rock is a borough in York County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,120 at the 2020 census. It is part of the York–Hanover metropolitan area.

==History==
In 1826, William Heathcote, the town&#x27;s founder and a native of Cheshire, England, moved to Pennsylvania in 1826. In 1837, he purchased a farm, hoping to tap into the adjacent river&#x27;s hydropower potential, and constructed a brick woolen mill on the ruins of an abandoned sawmill on his property, attracting mill workers and farmers to the area. Later that decade, the area received its own passenger train station, followed by a post office, church, iron foundry and machine shop in 1840s. In December 1843, Heathcote suggested that the town be named Glen Rock, taking inspiration from various lines from the poem &quot;Marmion&quot;.

By 1858, Glen Rock had grown to a population of 200 people. It officially incorporated as a borough on August 29, 1859, following petitioning from its residents. The mill, currently the oldest surviving building in Glen Rock, closed for renovations in the 1980s and reopened as a boutique hotel and restaurant. In 2022, the mill received a Backing Historic Small Restaurants grant from the National Trust for Historic Preservation and American Express to outfit the building with architectural elements closer in-line with the era in which it was built.

The Glen Rock Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

<text>Goldsboro (formerly Goldsborough) is a borough in York County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 930 at the 2020 census. It is part of the York–Hanover metropolitan area.

For historical reasons, the post office in Goldsboro is named &quot;Etters&quot;, although there is no incorporated place known by that name, and the United States Postal Service states that the name &quot;Etters&quot; is preferred over &quot;Goldsboro&quot; for addressing mail to ZIP code 17319.

==History==
In 1738 Nathan Hussey, a Quaker, from New Castle County, Delaware, obtained a grant for land on which the Village of Goldsboro now stands. In 1743 a road from Walnut Bottom, now in Cumberland County, to Hussey&#x27;s ferry was built. The turnpike was completed in 1816 from York to Harrisburg. Along the turnpike, near the site of Hussey&#x27;s Ferry (now Middletown Ferry) Henry Etter established Etter&#x27;s Tavern, which included Etter&#x27;s Post Office by 1838. Goldsboro was founded in 1850 upon completion of a railroad from York Haven to Harrisburg. Prior to completion of the railroad the 20 or so houses that made up Goldsboro were affectionately referred to as Martinsville, for Martin P. Burger who owned a store near the village. When the railway was completed in 1850, the village was named Goldsborough in honor of J.M. Goldsborough, the civil engineer of the railway. Dr. Alexander Small in 1849 surveyed Goldsborough and officially advertised lots for sale in the village of Goldsborough as early as November 19, 1850. The Borough of Goldsborough was incorporated in 1864.

A historical association was founded in 1976. The Goldsboro Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

===The American Lightweight Championship===
On January 15, 1867, a prize fight took place in a field just north of Goldsboro between Sam Collyer and Johnny McGlade for the American Lightweight championship of boxing, and a purse of $2000. It was a bare-knuckle fight, which was illegal at the time, so they planned the match for the same day as the inauguration of the Governor of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg, the Civil War General John W. Geary, thinking that more attention would be on that event. The York County sheriff arrived after securing a posse with the Zeigle Guards, a military company already on their way to attend the inauguration. However, due to a miscommunication, the guards did not get off the train in Goldsboro, so the sheriff was left alone to try and make any arrests, which he was unable to.

The fight lasted 47 rounds in 55 minutes. Collyer was the winner and kept the American Lightweight Title. It was estimated that between 1000 and 2000 spectators were in attendance, including members of the PA state legislature, gamblers and underworld figures Kit Burns and Harry Hill, plus other boxers and former title holders of the day Young Barney Aaron, Dan Kerrigan, Johnny Moneghan and Joe Coburn. It was estimated over $200,000 in bets were won as a result of the fight.

===Etymology of the name &quot;Etters&quot;===
The name &quot;Etters&quot;, used by the USPS to refer to the post office in Goldsboro, comes from the establishment in 1838 of a post office inside a tavern owned by Henry Etter, a former Revolutionary War soldier, approximately one mile north of the current location of Goldsboro. The post office was moved to Goldsboro in 1850, at which time it retained the name &quot;Etters&quot; to avoid confusion with the already established post office in Gouldsboro, Wayne County, PA. The 17319 ZIP code also covers other parts of York County well beyond the borough of Goldsboro, including parts of Fairview Township, Valley Green, Newberry Township, Lewisberry Borough, and Yocumtown Village.

==Geography==
Goldsboro is located along the Susquehanna River and has a view of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station, the site of the largest nuclear accident in the United States.

The racial makeup of the borough was 98.51% White, 0.21% Native American, 0.53% Asian, 0.11% Pacific Islander, and 0.64% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.64% of the population.

Of the 333 households, 46.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 67.6% were married couples living together, 7.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 21.9% were non-families. 17.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 3.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

<text>Hanover is a borough in York County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 16,429 at the 2020 census. Located southwest of York and north-northwest of Baltimore, Maryland, the town is situated in a productive agricultural region. It is named after the German city of Hanover and is a principal city of the York–Hanover metropolitan area.

Hanover was the site of the final encounter between the Union and Confederate armies before they fought against each other in the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. Hanover has since become known as the &quot;Snack Food Capital of the World&quot; due to the establishment of multiple food manufacturing businesses there during the 20th century. Notable companies based in the borough include Utz Brands and Snyder&#x27;s of Hanover.

==History==

In 1727, John Digges, an Irish nobleman of Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, obtained a grant of of land where Hanover is now located from Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore. The area was called Digges Choice, and in 1730, a group of Catholics started the settlement that became known as the Conewego Settlement. Settlers from both Maryland and Pennsylvania began moving into the area in the 1730s. At this time, Maryland and Pennsylvania did not agree on the northern border of Maryland and the southern border of Pennsylvania, and the area that is now Hanover was in the disputed area claimed by both states. This led to numerous disputes about property ownership from the 1730s until 1760. The dispute was settled when Maryland and Pennsylvania hired British expert surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon to survey what became known as the Mason–Dixon Line. This line was surveyed between 1763 and 1767, and put an end to decades of disputes over rights and ownership.

In 1745, a Scot-Irishman named Richard McAllister (father of Matthew McAllister) purchased the tract of land upon which the original town of Hanover was built. McAllister was a Presbyterian who had recently migrated from the Cumberland Valley. Hanover at that time was covered with a dense forest of hickory, walnut, and oak trees. McAllister erected a log house at what is now the corner of Baltimore and Middle streets, and opened a store and tavern. In 1763, McAllister divided his farm into lots and founded the town of Hanover. German settlers nicknamed the settlement &quot;Hickory Town&quot; after the thick groves of hickory trees that grew in the area. The name Hanover was suggested by Michael Tanner, who was one of the commissioners who laid out York County in 1749 and owned large tracts of land southeast of the town. Tanner&#x27;s choice of the name came from the fact that he was a native of Hanover, Germany. The town&#x27;s founders, who wanted to please the German settlers, agreed to the name. Hanover was also sometimes referred to as &quot;McAllister&#x27;s Town&quot; in its early years.

===Hanover and the American Revolution===
Thomas Jefferson spent the night of April 12, 1776 at the Sign of the Horse, an inn, owned by Caspar Reinecker on Frederick Street. Records indicate that Jefferson paid &quot;Rhenegher&quot; 11 shillings, 6 pence for dinner and lodging. He was on his way from Monticello to Philadelphia to attend the first meeting of the Continental Congress, where on June 10 he would begin to draft the Declaration of Independence. At the time, Hanover was located at the crossing of two well-traveled roads, one from the port of Baltimore to points north and west and the other between Philadelphia and the Valley of Virginia. When Jefferson returned from Philadelphia to Monticello, he again dined and spent the night of September 5 at Reinecker&#x27;s inn.

At the start of the Revolutionary War, Hanover consisted of about 500 homes, most of which were built out of logs. After the war, the population increased steadily until the War of 1812. At the time of the advance of the British on Baltimore in 1814, Hanover and vicinity furnished two companies of infantry commanded by Captain Frederick Metzgar and John Bair. These two companies left Hanover on foot Sunday morning, August 28, 1814, and reached the city of Baltimore at 9 A.M., Tuesday. September 11, where they were marched to North Point, spending that night on their arms, and next day, the memorable September 12, 1814, they took part in the engagement with the British, who retreated soon after. The Hanover Companies together with other companies from York County, returned home after two weeks&#x27; service, not being needed longer.

After the War of 1812, the town experienced only minor growth until 1852, when construction of the Hanover Branch Railroad to Hanover Junction was completed. In 1858 the Gettysburg Railroad opened a railroad link westward to Gettysburg. The Hanover and York Railroad completed a rail line to York in 1876.

===Civil War era===

During the American Civil War, the Battle of Hanover was fought on June 30, 1863. Union cavalry under Judson Kilpatrick encountered Confederate cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart and a sharp fight ensued in the town and in farm fields to the south, particularly along Frederick Street. The final encounter between Union and Confederate forces prior to the Battle of Gettysburg, this inconclusive engagement delayed the Confederate cavalry on their way to the Battle of Gettysburg. Three days before the battle, another detachment of Virginia cavalry had briefly occupied Hanover, &quot;collecting&quot; supplies and horses from local citizens.

Over the years, its industries have included the making of cigars, gloves, silks, flavine, water wheels, flour, shirts, shoes, machine-shop products, furniture, wire cloth, and ironstone grinders.

The town has lent its name to a brand of canned vegetables, and a mail-order gift company based there. Hanover&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;Die Pennsylvania Wochenschrift&quot;, was published in German in 1797. In 1805, the &quot;Hanover Gazette&quot; followed suit, also published in German.

The Hanover Historic District, Eichelberger High School, George Nace (Neas) House, and US Post Office-Hanover are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Modern era===
On July 13, 1991, Hanover&#x27;s town square was the site of a two-day race riot. During the summer, White residents were upset by the presence of young Black men in the town square, who had begun to gather there after the local parks were temporarily closed. In addition, two young, interracial couples had been seen walking downtown. In the lead-up to the riot, White residents spat on the Black men visiting their girlfriends in the town square, while the Baltimore Sun reported that there had been tension &quot;building for several weeks,&quot; and the Hanover Evening Sun reported that at least one resident &quot;had heard rumors throughout the week that a motorcycle gang was coming into town to start trouble with a few interracial groups of juveniles.&quot; Other residents were quoted stating that the biker gang&#x27;s explicit purpose was to &quot;take back the town.&quot; On July 13, by around 11:00pm, an estimated 200 to 400 White people gathered on one side of the town square, with a much smaller group of a &quot;half dozen&quot; Black juveniles on the other side, with various police forming a line between the two. Both groups shouted at one another throughout the night. Eventually, a car full of Black juveniles pulled up alongside the bikers before some of the bikers began chasing the car down the alleyway, which elicited a cheer from some members of the White crowd. The police line struggled to contain the rioters and eventually ordered the smaller, Black crowd to disperse just after 11:00pm. As the smaller side dispersed, police lost control of the rioters, who began to fight using weapons like &quot;baseball bats, knives, tire chains, bricks and hockey sticks,&quot; though there was only one serious injury reported. Eleven people were arrested during the first night; on the second day, a state of emergency was declared by Mayor W. Roy Attlesberger, who instructed police to arrest anyone on the streets after midnight. Police shut down major roadways into Hanover. Nevertheless, many minor skirmishes broke out, and ultimately thirty six people were arrested including the eleven from the day prior. Media reports following the two-day event described the town square as looking like a &quot;battlefield.&quot; In the aftermath of the riot, according to the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot;, &quot;many residents interviewed yesterday shared the view ... [blaming] the troubles on the two women for dating Black men and bringing them into Hanover,&quot; many of whom also referred to the Black residents as &quot;coloreds.&quot;

On October 24, 2018, Hanover Borough&#x27;s first African-American mayor was sworn in. Hanover Borough council selected Myneca Ojo, 56, to fill the office recently vacated by Ben Adams, who moved away from the community. Myneca Ojo was the former Director of Diversity at the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. She is the second woman to be mayor in the borough. Margret Hormel was the first woman mayor, serving from 1993 to 2007.

<doc id="134247" wikidata="Q10749189" url="?curid=134247" title="Hellam Township, Pennsylvania">
<text>Hellam Township is a township in York County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 5,939 at the 2020 census. Founded in 1739, it was the first township in the area, and it originally included the entirety of modern York and Adams counties. Fire department services are provided jointly by the Hallam and Wrightsville fire departments, located in the boroughs of Hallam and Wrightsville.

==History==
The Mifflin House, an Underground Railroad site in the township dating to the 1700s, was used by the Mifflin family in the 19th century to &quot;hide freedom-seekers and ferry them across the Susquehanna River on their way to Philadelphia.&quot; The house was sold into the Huber family in 1856, who sold it to the Blessing family in 1959. As of May 2017, the property was at risk of demolition for development of a business park. By December 2017, a funding campaign was started to help pay for a legal challenge to save the property, reportedly eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In July 2018, a York County Court of Common Pleas judge ruled in favor of a township zoning officer&#x27;s decision (and zoning hearing board&#x27;s support) to deny a demolition permit for the house. The developer appealed the decision to the Commonwealth Court. In February 2019, township supervisors approved unanimously a subdivision plan that includes a two-year moratorium on development of more than surrounding Mifflin House, to give preservationists time to raise enough money to save it.

==History==
Founded in 1837, Jacobus was originally called &quot;New Paradise.&quot; The name was later changed because of misdelivered mail between New Paradise and the town of Paradise, in neighboring Lancaster County.

The name &quot;Jacobus&quot; was derived from the name of the town&#x27;s postmaster, Jacob Geiselman (1829–1909). To correct the problem of the misdelivered mail, the United States Post Office Department notified Geiselman to change the name of the post office; however, Geiselman was unable to think of another name. Therefore, the mail was sorted and forwarded to Geiselman labeled as &quot;Jacob-US Mail&quot;; which was later shortened to &quot;Jacob-US.&quot; The post office was then renamed Jacobus, and the town was renamed accordingly. In 1929, Jacobus became an incorporated borough under Pennsylvania law.

<text>Lewisberry is a borough in York County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 380 at the 2020 census. It is part of the York–Hanover metropolitan area.

==History==

===Early settlement===
The lands in and around the borough of Lewisberry were under control of the Susquehannock people until the first Quaker settlements in the 1730s. These settlements were among the first Quaker settlements in America west of the Susquehanna River. Among the group of original titleholders along the small creek that would become known as Bennett Run were Ellis Lewis, Joseph Bennett, John Rankin, John Heald, and John Hall. At this time, the area that would become York County was still almost entirely populated by the Susquehannock Indians. Yet there are few recorded conflicts between these early settlers and the native population. In this area that would later become majority Pennsylvania German, the first and second waves of settlers were almost entirely English speakers and included the Kirks, Rankins, Huttons, Garetsons, Nebingers, Eppleys, Starrs, Fosters, Clines, Stromingers, Moores, Frankelbergers, Suttons, Wickershams, Prowells, Millers, and Hammonds. While most were Quakers, a significant minority were Anglicans. The Quaker meeting house at the intersection of Old Quaker and Lewisberry roads (PA 382) is the original Quaker meeting house in the area.

===Founding of borough===

The borough&#x27;s founder, Eli Lewis, was born nearby in 1750, the son of one of the original settlers, Ellis Lewis. On the eve of the American Revolution, Eli opened a store on the site of the current borough. Lewis and members of other prominent families in the area served in the Pennsylvania militia, and Eli rose to the rank of major. Over the course of the war, the town became known for producing guns, and the Committee of Safety for York County contracted with area gunsmiths to supply the Continental Army; guns made in Lewisberry were in use by the US Army as late as the Siege of Veracruz during the Mexican–American War of 1846. Following the Revolutionary War, Lewis&#x27; fortune grew (and he eventually owned 850 acres in the area) and his store was the center of commerce in the Redland Valley. In 1798, Issac Kirk surveyed twelve acres of land and laid out lots for Lewis, who wanted a town to exist on the site. While all of the lots were not immediately sold, many were, and the town began a modest growth. Between 1790 and 1798, Major Lewis had lived in Harrisburg, where he took up printing and published the first Harrisburg newspaper, &quot;The Advertiser&quot;, which was then sold to John Wyeth, who renamed it &quot;The Oracle of Dauphin&quot;. While living in Harrisburg, Lewis also published the popular poem, &quot;St. Clair&#x27;s Defeat,&quot; which described the defeat of Arthur St. Clair by the tribes of the Western Confederacy during the Battle of the Wabash.

===Incorporation and growth===
Lewisberry was not incorporated until 1832, fifty years later, and the first census figures of 1840 show a population of 220. In 1800, Henry Ensminger opened a large tannery just south of town that was later owned and operated by Samuel Grove. More significant for the town&#x27;s growth was John Herman, who built a large flour mill on the west side of the borough. But the town&#x27;s most successful operator was Andrew Cline, who ran a large and successful milling business during the second half of the 19th century. The mill and house are still standing just outside the borough beside Silver Lake, which was created to power the mill. One of Lewisberry&#x27;s most important small industries during the 19th and early 20th centuries was the manufacture of block brimstone matches, and the families of Lyman Lewis, Herman Kirk, Moses Magrew, Rt. Starr, and Lyman Shettle became prosperous through this industry.

In the early 19th century, Joseph Potts manufactured the area&#x27;s first coffee mills out of his home. This industry grew under his children, and by the middle of the century, Lewisberry was producing large numbers of coffee grinders in a small factory near the Quaker meeting house. In 1835, William Smith started a newspaper in the bustling town. In 1837, Lewisberry native Hervey Hammond began manufacture of the patented Hammond window sash spring, and in 1838, President Martin Van Buren installed Hammond springs in all of the White House&#x27;s windows.

==Gravity Hill==

The intersection of Pennsylvania Route 177 and Pleasant View Road near the borough is said to allow an automobile in neutral to drift uphill. According to legend, this effect is caused by the ghosts of children once killed in a bus accident, who push the car uphill to prevent similar occurrences. However, the phenomenon is caused by a gravity hill optical illusion.

==Little League World Series==
In 2015, the Red Land Little League from Lewisberry participated in the Little League World Series, winning the U.S. Championship and finishing as runner-up to Japan in the world championship game. It was the first appearance for a Pennsylvania team in the final game since 1990 when the Shippensburg Little League Team was defeated by the San Hua Little League Team of Tainan, Taiwan.

<text>Loganville is a borough in York County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,427 at the time of the 2020 census. It was founded in 1820 and named after Colonel Henry Logan. It is part of the York–Hanover metropolitan area.

==History==
Established in the center of Springfield Township in York County, Pennsylvania in 1820, the land which would ultimately become the community of Loganville was surveyed by Robert Richie and plotted by auctioneer Robert Wilson, who later named the town in honor of Colonel Henry Logan, a prominent, 19th-century politician.

Wilson subsequently established the town&#x27;s first post office, operating it from his home as his new town&#x27;s first postmaster. He was succeeded by Samuel Keyser.

The town&#x27;s first store was operated by Jacob Gipe; additional stores were subsequently opened and operated by Frederick Asper, Paul Burbank and Frederick Overmiller. Between 1830 and 1840, the town grew from one store, one hotel and twelve houses to include a total of twenty houses and a population of ninety.

The town was subsequently incorporated as a borough on April 2, 1852. Its first elected officials were Chief Burgess John F. Beck Sr., Assistant Burgess Michael Snyder, Judge John F. Beck, Constable Charles Overmiller, and borough council members Daniel Goodling, John Hildebrand, Adam Krout, Samuel Smith, and Frederick Venus. School directors were Joseph Hartman, Casper Hildebrand and Henry Kerlinger. Jacob Glatfelter and George H. Reever held positions as inspectors.

On August 20, 1858, musicians Henry Decker and Henry Kerlinger succeeded in forming the Loganville Cornet Band. The original membership roster also included Deterich Hildebrand.

George P. Yost, MD and George W. Holtzapple, MD were two of the community&#x27;s first physicians.

By 1880, the borough&#x27;s population had climbed to three hundred and twelve.

By the middle of that decade, leaders of the increasingly popular Logan Cornet Band had increased the ensemble&#x27;s membership to twenty and had purchased new silver-plated instruments for its members, as well as a concert hall in which to host the band&#x27;s performances.

Teachers in the community&#x27;s public schools at that time included J. M. Bailey and E. B. Goodling.

<doc id="134258" wikidata="Q103350" url="?curid=134258" title="Serfdom">
<text>Serfdom was the status of many peasants under feudalism, specifically relating to manorialism, and similar systems. It was a condition of debt bondage and indentured servitude with similarities to and differences from slavery. It developed during late antiquity and the Early Middle Ages in Europe and lasted in some countries until the mid-19th century.

Unlike slaves, serfs could not be bought, sold, or traded individually, though they could, depending on the area, be sold together with land. Actual slaves, such as the kholops in Russia, could, by contrast, be traded like regular slaves, could be abused with no rights over their own bodies, could not leave the land they were bound to, and could marry only with their lord&#x27;s permission.

Serfs who occupied a plot of land were required to work for the lord of the manor who owned that land. In return, they were entitled to protection, justice, and the right to cultivate certain fields within the manor to maintain their own subsistence. Serfs were often required not only to work on the lord&#x27;s fields, but also in his mines and forests and to labour to maintain roads. The manor formed the basic unit of feudal society, and the lord of the manor and the villeins, and to a certain extent the serfs, were bound legally: by taxation in the case of the former, and economically and socially in the latter.

The decline of serfdom in Western Europe has sometimes been attributed to the widespread plague epidemic of the Black Death, which reached Europe in 1347 and caused massive fatalities, disrupting society. Conversely, serfdom grew stronger in Central and Eastern Europe, where it had previously been less common (this phenomenon was known as &quot;second serfdom&quot;).

In Eastern Europe, the institution persisted until the mid-19th century. In Russia, serfdom gradually evolved from the usual European form to become &quot;de facto&quot; slavery, though it continued to be called serfdom. In the Austrian Empire, serfdom was abolished by the 1781 Serfdom Patent; corvées continued to exist until 1848. Serfdom was abolished in Russia in 1861. Prussia declared serfdom unacceptable in its General State Laws for the Prussian States in 1792 and finally abolished it in October 1807, in the wake of the Prussian Reform Movement. In Finland, Norway, and Sweden, feudalism was never fully established, and serfdom did not exist; in Denmark, serfdom-like institutions did exist in both &quot;s&quot; (the &quot;stavnsbånd&quot;, from 1733 to 1788) and its vassal Iceland (the more restrictive &quot;vistarband&quot;, from 1490 until 1894).

According to medievalist historian Joseph R. Strayer, the concept of feudalism can also be applied to the societies of ancient Persia, ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt from the late Old Kingdom through the Middle Kingdom (Sixth to Twelfth dynasty), Islamic-ruled Northern and Central India, China (Zhou dynasty and end of Han dynasty) and Japan during the Shogunate. Wu Ta-k&#x27;un argued that the Shang-Zhou fengjian were kinship estates, quite distinct from feudalism. James Lee and Cameron Campbell describe the Chinese Qing dynasty (1644–1912) as also maintaining a form of serfdom.

Melvyn Goldstein described Tibet as having had serfdom until 1959, but whether or not the Tibetan form of peasant tenancy that qualified as serfdom was widespread is contested by other scholars. Bhutan is described by Tashi Wangchuk, a Bhutanese civil servant, as having officially abolished serfdom by 1959, but he believes that less than or about 10% of poor peasants were in copyhold situations.

The United Nations 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery also prohibits serfdom as a practice similar to slavery.

==History==

Social institutions similar to serfdom were known in ancient times. The status of the helots in the ancient Greek city-state of Sparta resembled that of the medieval serfs. By the 3rd century AD, the Roman Empire faced a labour shortage. Large Roman landowners increasingly relied on Roman freemen, acting as tenant farmers, instead of slaves to provide labour.

These tenant farmers, eventually known as &quot;coloni&quot;, saw their condition steadily erode. Because the tax system implemented by Diocletian assessed taxes based on both land and the inhabitants of that land, it became administratively inconvenient for peasants to leave the land where they were counted in the census.

Medieval serfdom really began with the breakup of the Carolingian Empire around the 10th century. During this period, powerful feudal lords encouraged the establishment of serfdom as a source of agricultural labour. Serfdom, indeed, was an institution that reflected a fairly common practice whereby great landlords were assured that others worked to feed them and were held down, legally and economically, while doing so.

This arrangement provided most of the agricultural labour throughout the Middle Ages. Slavery persisted right through the Middle Ages, but it was rare.

In the later Middle Ages, serfdom began to disappear west of the Rhine even as it spread through eastern Europe. Serfdom reached Eastern Europe centuries later than Western Europeit became dominant around the 15th century. In many of these countries serfdom was abolished during the Napoleonic invasions of the early 19th century, though in some it persisted until mid- or late- 19th century.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;serf&quot; originated from the Middle French and was derived from the Latin (&quot;slave&quot;). In Late Antiquity and most of the Middle Ages, what are now called serfs were usually designated in Latin as . As slavery gradually disappeared and the legal status of became nearly identical to that of the , the term changed meaning into the modern concept of &quot;serf&quot;. The word &quot;serf&quot; is first recorded in English in the late 15th century, and came to its current definition in the 17th century. &quot;Serfdom&quot; was coined in 1850.

==Dependency and the lower orders==
Serfs had a specific place in feudal society, as did barons and knights: in return for protection, a serf would reside upon and work a parcel of land within the manor of his lord. Thus, the manorial system exhibited a degree of reciprocity.

One rationale held that serfs and freemen &quot;worked for all&quot; while a knight or baron &quot;fought for all&quot; and a churchman &quot;prayed for all&quot;; thus everyone had a place (see Estates of the realm). The serf was the worst fed and rewarded. However, unlike slaves, they had certain rights in land and property.

A lord of the manor could not sell his serfs as a Roman might sell his slaves. On the other hand, if he chose to dispose of a parcel of land, the serfs associated with that land stayed with it to serve their new lord; simply speaking, they were implicitly sold in mass and as a part of a lot. This unified system preserved for the lord long-acquired knowledge of practices suited to the land. Further, a serf could not abandon his lands without permission, nor did he possess a saleable title in them.

===Initiation===
A freeman became a serf usually through force or necessity. Sometimes the greater physical and legal force of a local magnate intimidated freeholders or allodial owners into dependency. Often a few years of crop failure, a war, or brigandage might leave a person unable to make his own way. In such a case, he could strike a bargain with a lord of a manor. In exchange for gaining protection, his service was required: in labour, produce, or cash, or a combination of all. These bargains became formalised in a ceremony known as &quot;bondage&quot;, in which a serf placed his head in the lord&#x27;s hands, akin to the ceremony of homage where a vassal placed his hands between those of his overlord. These oaths bound the lord and his new serf in a feudal contract and defined the terms of their agreement. Often these bargains were severe.

A 7th-century Anglo Saxon &quot;Oath of Fealty&quot; states:
To become a serf was a commitment that encompassed all aspects of the serf&#x27;s life. The children born to serfs inherited their status, and were considered born into serfdom. By taking on the duties of serfdom, people bound themselves and their progeny.

===Class system===
The social class of the peasantry can be differentiated into smaller categories. These distinctions were often less clear than suggested by their different names. Most often, there were two types of peasants:
# freemen, workers whose tenure within the manor was freehold
# villein

Lower classes of peasants, known as cottars or bordars, generally comprising the younger sons of villeins; vagabonds; and slaves, made up the lower class of workers.

====Coloni====
The system of the late Roman Empire can be considered the predecessor of Western European feudal serfdom.

====Freemen====
Freemen, or free tenants, held their land by one of a variety of contracts of feudal land-tenure and were essentially rent-paying tenant farmers who owed little or no service to the lord, and had a good degree of security of tenure and independence. In parts of 11th-century England freemen made up only 10% of the peasant population, and in most of the rest of Europe their numbers were also small.

====Ministeriales====
Ministeriales were hereditary unfree knights tied to their lord, that formed the lowest rung of nobility in the Holy Roman Empire.

====Villeins====
In England, after the Norman conquest of 1066, an unfree tenant who held their land subject to providing agricultural and other services to their lord, was described as a villein. Villeins had limited rights and were tied to their lord. However they did have
more rights and were of a higher status than the lowest serf. They had to work on the demensne (their lords farm) in return for receiving small plots of land, to support their family. 

Villeins were not freemen, for example they and their daughters were not allowed to marry without their lords permission.
They could not move away without their lord&#x27;s consent and the acceptance of the lord to whose manor they proposed to migrate to. Villeins were generally able to hold their own property, unlike slaves (serfs).Villeinage, as opposed to other forms of serfdom, was most common in Continental European feudalism, where land ownership had developed from roots in Roman law.

A variety of kinds of villeinage existed in Europe in the Middle Ages. Half-villeins received only half as many strips of land for their own use and owed a full complement of labour to the lord, often forcing them to rent out their services to other serfs to make up for this hardship. Villeinage was not a purely uni-directional exploitative relationship. In the Middle Ages, land within a lord&#x27;s manor provided sustenance and survival, and being a villein guaranteed access to land, and crops secure from theft by marauding robbers. Landlords, even where they were legally entitled to do so, rarely evicted villeins because of the value of their labour. Villeinage was much preferable to being a vagabond, a slave, or an unlanded labourer.

In many medieval countries, a villein could gain freedom by escaping from a manor to a city or borough and living there for more than a year; but this action involved the loss of land rights and agricultural livelihood, a prohibitive price unless the landlord was especially tyrannical or conditions in the village were unusually difficult.

In medieval England, two types of villeins existed – &quot;villeins regardant&quot; that were tied to land and &quot;villeins in gross&quot; that could be traded separately from land.

====Bordars and cottagers====
In England, the Domesday Book, of 1086, uses (bordar) and (cottar) as interchangeable terms, &quot;cottar&quot; deriving from the native Anglo-Saxon tongue whereas &quot;bordar&quot; derived from the French.

Status-wise, the bordar or cottar ranked below a villein in the social hierarchy of a manor, holding a cottage, garden and just enough land to feed a family. In England, at the time of the Domesday Survey, this would have comprised between about . Under an Elizabethan statute, the Erection of Cottages Act 1588, the cottage had to be built with at least of land. The later inclosure acts (1604 onwards) removed the cottars&#x27; right to any land: &quot;before the Enclosures Act the cottager was a farm labourer with land and after the Enclosures Act the cottager was a farm labourer without land&quot;.

The bordars and cottars did not own their draught oxen or horses. The Domesday Book showed that England comprised 12% freeholders, 35% serfs or villeins, 30% cotters and bordars, and 9% slaves.

====Smerd====
Smerdy were a type of serfs above kholops in Medieval Poland and Kievan Rus&#x27;.

====Kholops====
Kholops were the lowest class of serfs in the medieval and early modern Russia. They had status similar to slaves, and could be freely traded.

====Slaves====
The last type of serf was the slave. Slaves had the fewest rights and benefits from the manor. They owned no tenancy in land, worked for the lord exclusively and survived on donations from the landlord. It was always in the interest of the lord to prove that a servile arrangement existed, as this provided him with greater rights to fees and taxes. The status of a man was a primary issue in determining a person&#x27;s rights and obligations in many of the manorial court-cases of the period. Also, runaway slaves could be beaten if caught.

===Duties===
The usual serf (not including slaves or cottars) paid his fees and taxes in the form of seasonally appropriate labour. Usually, a portion of the week was devoted to ploughing his lord&#x27;s fields held in demesne, harvesting crops, digging ditches, repairing fences, and often working in the manor house. The remainder of the serf&#x27;s time was spent tending his own fields, crops and animals in order to provide for his family. Most manorial work was segregated by gender during the regular times of the year. During the harvest, the whole family was expected to work the fields.

A major difficulty of a serf&#x27;s life was that his work for his lord coincided with, and took precedence over, the work he had to perform on his own lands: when the lord&#x27;s crops were ready to be harvested, so were his own. On the other hand, the serf of a benign lord could look forward to being well fed during his service; it was a lord without foresight who did not provide a substantial meal for his serfs during the harvest and planting times. In exchange for this work on the lord&#x27;s demesne, the serfs had certain privileges and rights, including for example the right to gather deadwood – an essential source of fuel – from their lord&#x27;s forests.

In addition to service, a serf was required to pay certain taxes and fees. Taxes were based on the assessed value of his lands and holdings. Fees were usually paid in the form of agricultural produce rather than cash. The best ration of wheat from the serf&#x27;s harvest often went to the landlord. Generally hunting and trapping of wild game by the serfs on the lord&#x27;s property was prohibited. On Easter Sunday the peasant family perhaps might owe an extra dozen eggs, and at Christmas, a goose was perhaps required, too. When a family member died, extra taxes were paid to the lord as a form of feudal relief to enable the heir to keep the right to till what land he had. Any young woman who wished to marry a serf outside of her manor was forced to pay a fee for the right to leave her lord, and in compensation for her lost labour.

Often there were arbitrary tests to judge the worthiness of their tax payments. A chicken, for example, might be required to be able to jump over a fence of a given height to be considered old enough or well enough to be valued for tax purposes. The restraints of serfdom on personal and economic choice were enforced through various forms of manorial customary law and the manorial administration and court baron.

It was also a matter of discussion whether serfs could be required by law in times of war or conflict to fight for their lord&#x27;s land and property. In the case of their lord&#x27;s defeat, their own fate might be uncertain, so the serf certainly had an interest in supporting his lord.

===Rights===
Villeins had more rights and status than those held as slaves, but were under a number of legal restrictions that differentiated them from the freeman. Within his constraints, a serf had some freedoms. Though the common wisdom is that a serf owned &quot;only his belly&quot;even his clothes were the property, in law, of his lorda serf might still accumulate personal property and wealth, and some serfs became wealthier than their free neighbours, although this happened rarely. A well-to-do serf might even be able to buy his freedom.

A serf could grow what crop he saw fit on his lands, although a serf&#x27;s taxes often had to be paid in wheat. The surplus he would sell at market.

The landlord could not dispossess his serfs without legal cause and was supposed to protect them from the depredations of robbers or other lords, and he was expected to support them by charity in times of famine. Many such rights were enforceable by the serf in the manorial court.

===Variations===
Forms of serfdom varied greatly through time and regions. In some places, serfdom was merged with or exchanged for various forms of taxation.

The amount of labour required varied. In Poland, for example, it was commonly a few days per year per household in the 13th century, one day per week per household in the 14th century, four days per week per household in the 17th century, and six days per week per household in the 18th century. Early serfdom in Poland was mostly limited to the royal territories (&quot;królewszczyzny&quot;).

&quot;Per household&quot; means that every dwelling had to give a worker for the required number of days. For example, in the 18th century, six people: a peasant, his wife, three children and a hired worker might be required to work for their lord one day a week, which would be counted as six days of labour.

Serfs served on occasion as soldiers in the event of conflict and could earn freedom or even ennoblement for valour in combat. Serfs could purchase their freedom, be manumitted by generous owners, or flee to towns or to newly settled land where few questions were asked. Laws varied from country to country: in England a serf who made his way to a chartered town (i.e. a borough) and evaded recapture for a year and a day obtained his freedom and became a burgher of the town.

==Serfdom by country and location==

===Americas===
====Aztec Empire====
In the Aztec Empire, the Tlacotin class held similarities to serfdom. Even at its height, slaves only ever made up 2% of the population.

===Byzantine Empire===
The paroikoi were the Byzantine equivalent of serfs.

===France===

Serfdom in France started to diminish after the Black Death in France, when the lack of work force made manumission more common from that point onward, and by the 18th-century, serfdom had become relatively rare in most of France. 

In 1779, the reforms of Jacques Necker abolished serfdom in all Crown lands in France. On the outbreak of the French Revolution of 1789, between 140,000 and 1,500,000 serfs remained in France, most of them on clerical lands in Franche-Comté, Berry, Burgundy and Marche.
However, although formal serfdom no longer existed in most of France, the feudal seigneurial laws still granted noble landlords many of the rights previously exercised over serfs, and the peasants of Auvergne, Nivernais and Champagne, though formally not serfs, could still not move freely. 

Serfdom was formally abolished in France on 4 August 1789, and the remaining feudal rights that gave landlords control rights over peasants were abolished in 1789-93.

===Ireland===
====Gaelic Ireland====
In Gaelic Ireland, a political and social system existing in Ireland from the prehistoric period (500 BC or earlier) up until the Norman conquest (12th century AD), the (&quot;hut-dweller&quot;), (perhaps linked to , &quot;soil&quot;) and (&quot;old dwelling-house&quot;) were low-ranked semi-free servile tenants similar to serfs. According to Laurence Ginnell, the and &quot;were not free to leave the territory except with permission, and in practice they usually served the &quot;flaith&quot; [prince]. They had no political or clan rights, could neither sue nor appear as witnesses, and were not free in the matter of entering into contracts. They could appear in a court of justice only in the name of the &quot;flaith&quot; or other person to whom they belonged, or whom they served, or by obtaining from an aire of the tuath to which they belonged permission to sue in his name.&quot; A was defined by D. A. Binchy as &quot;a &#x27;tenant at will,&#x27; settled by the lord (&quot;flaith&quot;) on a portion of the latter&#x27;s land; his services to the lord are always undefined. Although his condition is servile, he retains the right to abandon his holding on giving due notice to the lord and surrendering to him two thirds of the products of his husbandry.&quot;

===Poland===
Serfdom in Poland became the dominant form of relationship between peasants and nobility in the 17th century, and was a major feature of the economy of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, although its origins can be traced back to the 12th century.

The first steps towards abolition of serfdom were enacted in the Constitution of 3 May 1791, and it was essentially eliminated by the Połaniec Manifesto. However, these reforms were partly nullified by the partition of Poland. Frederick the Great had abolished serfdom in the territories he gained from the first partition of Poland. Over the course of the 19th century, it was gradually abolished on Polish and Lithuanian territories under foreign control, as the region began to industrialize.

===Russia===

Serfdom became the dominant form of relation between Russian peasants and nobility in the 17th century. Serfdom only existed in central and southern areas of the Russian Empire. It was never established in the North, in the Urals, or in Siberia. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Human Rights&quot;:

Russia&#x27;s over 23 million (about 38% of the total population) privately held serfs were freed from their lords by an edict of Alexander II in 1861. The owners were compensated through taxes on the freed serfs. State serfs were emancipated in 1866.

Summers Canning Company operated in the town for years, canning the freshest harvests and then shipping the final products. Summers Canning Company was sold to Hanover Foods in 1984. A mural depicting scenes from the Summers Canning Company is displayed on a building along the York County Heritage Rail Trail.

<text>Newberry Township is a township in York County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 15,670 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.91%, is water. The township is located in northern York County in south-central Pennsylvania. The Susquehanna River forms the eastern border of the township, and the western part of the township entirely surrounds the borough of Lewisberry.

==History==

Prior to the coming of the first settlers in 1736, Newberry Township was inhabited by the Susquehannock Indians. Before 1736, all settlement in Pennsylvania was kept east of the Susquehanna River, but the Indian Treaty of 1736 extended Lancaster County&#x27;s boundary westward indefinitely. Quaker families from Lancaster and Chester counties immediately set out across the Susquehanna to find new land. These settlers utilized the Middletown Ferry to access the west bank of the river, and when they reached what is now Newberry Township, they settled throughout the Fishing Creek and Bennetts Run valleys. Newberry Township was organized in 1742 and included what is now called Fairview Township.

Prior to the start of the Revolutionary War, the early Quaker settlers became dissatisfied with the quality of the farmland in the Newberry Township and began to move out. German families from central York County, and Berks and Lancaster counties, soon arrived to take over the vacant farmland.

By the late 18th century, several towns had sprung up throughout the township. Lewisberry and Newberrytown were early Quaker settlements. Newberrytown began as a tract of Quaker meeting land, with a log meetinghouse built in 1745. Later, a new meetinghouse was built halfway between Lewisberry and the Newberrytown meeting land, and the tract was developed as a town in 1791. Newberrytown was situated on the road from Lancaster to Carlisle (which crossed the Susquehanna River at the York Haven Ferry), and became an important stopping place along the way. Lewisberry was also surveyed and platted in the 1790s. Its stores became busy and prosperous. Schools were operated in both communities.

Early settlers were also attracted to the vicinity of Yocumtown because of the water power of Fishing Creek. They have built fulling mills along its banks that carded wool for area farmers, woolen cloth mills, and grist mills. By the mid-1820s, the village of Yocumtown had established itself with a log schoolhouse, a blacksmith shop, and a tannery.

Goldsboro and York Haven prospered due to their location on the Susquehanna River and adjoining canal route. A ferry was also established at the site of Goldsboro in 1738. Both Goldsboro and the village of Cly were located along the important stagecoach route between York and Harrisburg, where a turnpike was completed between the two towns in 1816. The railroad, built in the late 1830s, also ran through Goldsboro. However, the village remained small through the first half of the 19th century.
York Haven, also a ferry point, began as a flour milling town. In 1814, the York Haven Company, which built four large mills, prepared the town plan. Large hotels, dry goods and hardware stores, copper shops that manufactured flour barrels, and a sawmill all became part of the town&#x27;s healthy economy. Large keelboats of wheat were brought down the river to the mills in York Haven, then the flour was sent by wagon or canal to Baltimore. The town became a popular resort, with city boarders in the summer and gambling at the hotel. Early prosperity began to decline during the 1830s, when the Codorus Canal was completed into the town of York, luring business away from York Haven. The flour mills closed down but were later replaced with a paper mill.

In 1803, Fairview Township was formed from the northern half of the original Newberry Township. Lewisberry incorporated as a separate borough in 1832, as did Goldsboro in 1864 and York Haven in 1892. With these losses of population and area, Newberry Township reached the beginning of the 20th century with a population of just over 2,000 (only 296 more people than in 1783).

During the first two decades of the 20th century, the population of the township actually declined. The following three decades showed a slow, but steady, increase in population. Development to this point (1950) was mainly concentrated along the major roads and villages in the township. Newberrytown, Cly, Conewago Heights, Yocumtown, Erney, and Pleasant Grove were the centers of population at that time.

The Hammersly-Strominger House, Kise Mill Bridge, and Kise Mill Bridge Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The town raises a cigar every New Year&#x27;s Eve. It was also known nationwide for its furniture industry, with several large factories producing ornate, hand crafted furniture for over 100 years.

<text>Seven Valleys is a borough in York County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 480 at the 2020 census. It is part of the York–Hanover metropolitan area.

==History==
The Seven Valleys basin was settled by forty families of the German Lutheran and Reformed faiths. They originated in the Hunsruck Mountains of the Rhineland Palatinate and arrived in this valley of the Codorus during the early fall of 1738. The lush meadows and gently rolling hills here reminded them of their homeland, even to the presence of seven valleys in the vicinity, and they called it Das Siebenthal, which in German means Seven Valleys.

By 1752 these religious hardworking farmers had organized churches and parochial schools, and holding fast to their German heritage, worshipped God and taught their children in the Pfalzer dialect of the German language for nearly 150 years.

With the coming of the railroad in 1838 and the opportunity to trade commercially with the outside world, the use of the English language gradually crept into the culture and by the end of the Civil War the use of German slowly began fading into the background.

In 1854 iron ore was discovered here and a great wave of prosperity swept the people of the valley : hell-bent-for-leather&quot; on into their golden age of the late 19th and early 20th century.

During the American Civil War, Seven Valleys served as an important stop along the North Central Railroad, and witnessed President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s funeral train pass by en route to Harrisburg.

On August 23, 1892 the village of Seven Valleys was incorporated into an independent entity and took its place among the small industrial towns of southern York County.

During its hey-day Seven Valleys was singularly noted for the manufacture of cigars and ice cream. The town boasted three physicians, one undertaker, two school teachers, two general stores, two hotels, two churches, two secret lodges, a baseball team, a feed and flour mill, two ice cream plants, a blacksmith shop, four cigar factories and a sewing factory, as well as numerous small entrepreneurial enterprises. It was a large railroad shipping point for cattle destined for the Baltimore markets and after a bank was founded in 1910 became the financial center for both North Codorus and Springfield Townships.

The Bridge 5+92, Northern Central Railway was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.

On August 9, 1834, the Borough of Shrewsbury was incorporated by an Act of the General Assembly. The area delineated was approximately one mile long and one-half mile wide, stretching lengthwise along the turnpike, with the borough center located at the crossroads.

In June 2004, the Springettsbury Township supervisors and the Spring Garden Township commissioners formed an ad hoc committee to consider a combined fire service. A Joint Fire Service (JFS) committee first met in May 2005 to develop a framework. In 2006, a consulting firm was hired to provide a comprehensive plan. The plan, whose development received significant assistance from the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development, was approved by the JFS committee in 2007. Both townships approved a charter amendment for creation of a fire commission to govern the new department, composed of seven commissioners drawn from the two townships. The first meeting of the York Area United Fire and Rescue Commission was held in September 2007, and a formal consolidation took place on May 5, 2008, establishing York County Company 89. In 2009, the department began selling and removing from service its excessive apparatus and replacing it with new, such as three pumpers with two 2010 models. In April 2010, the York Area United Fire and Rescue Commission and the International Association of Fire Fighters, Local 2377, signed the first joint contract for the department.

<text>Spring Grove is a borough in York County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,372 at the 2020 census. It is part of the York–Hanover metropolitan area.

==History==
The site of Spring Grove was laid out in 1747 on the banks of Codorus Creek, midway between York and Hanover, by a surveyor for the Penns. Its growth since that time falls into two periods, each lasting approximately 100 years. The first witnessed development of the borough as an iron-making center. The second, which extends to the present day, is as a papermaking center. The businesses of both periods have relied on certain natural resources of the area.

Originally, Spring Grove was a part of Paradise Township and was contained within the boundaries of Lancaster County. York County was formed in 1749 and Jackson Township, including Spring Grove, in 1853. The residents of the community petitioned the County Court in 1882 for incorporation as a borough, and in August of that year their petition was granted. Since that time, the borough has grown in area as a result of annexation of the surrounding land, the largest annexation having taken place in 1953.

In the 1770s, attracted by the presence of water, iron ore and wood for charcoal in the Pigeon Hills, an iron manufacturer established a forge at &quot;Spring Forge&quot;. It is known as Spring Grove. The early German and English woodchoppers who flocked to this first Pennsylvania iron industry west of the Susquehanna River were the forebears of today&#x27;s community. By the mid-19th century, the manufacturing of iron had grown to a point where almost of iron bar were produced locally each year.

By 1851, however, the iron business had been suspended, and its buildings were converted to the manufacturing of paper. Once again local resources, wood and water, were largely responsible for the location of this industry in the Spring Grove area. Thirteen years later, the plant was purchased by P. H. Glatfelter for $14,000.

Other basic industries, such as brick-making and the manufacture of explosives, have from time to time established themselves in the borough. None, however, have remained as long nor have been as successful as the paper mill. Since 1865, the growth of the borough has reflected growth of the Glatfelter Paper Mill.

In August 2018, Glatfelter announced an agreement to sell its Specialty Papers division, which includes the Spring Grove mill, to private investment firm Lindsay Goldberg for $360 million, with the sale to close before 2019. Mill operations are expected to continue.

The Spring Grove Borough Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

<text>Springettsbury Township is a township in York County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 27,032 at the 2010 census. The township takes its name from Springett Penn, grandson of Pennsylvania founder William Penn. Located east and northeast of the city of York, the township hosts the York Galleria shopping mall and a large Harley-Davidson manufacturing plant.

==History==
Springettsbury Township was incorporated on April 20, 1891, formed from the northeast part of Spring Garden Township, which itself had separated from Hellam Township in 1822. Within Springettsbury, Diamond Silk Mill, East York Historic District, Pleasureville Historic District, and Strickler Family Farmhouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===18th century===
While William Penn received a royal grant in 1681, rights to the land that became Springettsbury Township were purchased from local Native Americans in the early 1700s before it was settled. Original peoples of the area at this time included the Susquehannock/Conestoga. The &quot;Treaty of 1736&quot; acquired a clear title for Penn&#x27;s heirs to the lands west of the Susquehanna River. Prior to this, Governor William Keith had held council with the native people on June 16, 1722. First identified as including , the land was marked as the &quot;Manor of Springettsbury&quot; and included dense forests of oak, chestnut, walnut, hickory, poplar, and ash trees. By 1739, Springettsbury Manor was encompassed by the founding of Hellam Township, and on August 19, 1749, York County was formed from what was the western part of Lancaster County. After a southern border dispute with Maryland was resolved, a re-survey in the 1760s found that the manor contained .

====Camp Security====
During the Revolutionary War, Camp Security operated in Springettsbury (then part of Hellam) Township from 1781 to the war&#x27;s end in 1783, and held prisoners from the Battles of Saratoga in New York and later those from the Battle of Yorktown in Virginia. Located just east of the current Penn Oaks development, the camp housed 1,500 prisoners, Continental Army guards, and their families. The first prisoners arrived from an overcrowded stockade in Charlottesville, Virginia, years after their 1777 capture, and were obliged to build their own stockade and huts, as well as guard shacks for their captors. The poor accommodations and shortages of food, clothing, and medicine contributed to the spread of disease such that hundreds died and were buried in mostly unmarked graves nearby. Yorktown prisoners arrived in 1782 and Camp Indulgence was built nearby, outside the stockade, with similar huts but with less security and easier parole for about 600 residents (non-commissioned officers and some women and children). An archeological dig found Camp Security&#x27;s stockade post holes in October 2022, and work to uncover more remains of the site continued in 2023.

===19th century===
Spring Garden Township, which then included the Springettsbury land, was formed out of the southwestern part of Hellam Township in 1822.

Springettsbury is not known to have had any Civil War battles, though a Confederate brigade from Georgia, commanded by General John B. Gordon, gathered in the township two miles east of York on June 28, 1863, before marching eastward to Wrightsville. A covered wooden bridge was burned by the Union army to prevent the Georgia brigade from crossing the Susquehanna River. Gordon arranged a bucket brigade to save the town from the spreading fire, and departed the next morning.

Citizens in the rapidly growing eastern portion of Spring Garden Township, led by John S. Hiestand, petitioned for a division of the township. After a Spring 1891 election, the petition was presented to the county courts and studied by three commissioners who decided &quot;in favor&quot; of the change. Springettsbury Township was officially sanctioned on April 20, 1891. At the turn of the century, a covered bridge on Diehl Mill Road (now North Sherman Street) crossed Mill Creek between these two townships. By the 1900 census, the new township had a population of 1,783.

===20th century===
East York was first developed in Springettsbury Township in 1903, and on May 21, 1904, the York/Wrightsville Electric Railroad (trolley) began with hourly service via tracks along East Market Street (later designated part of the Lincoln Highway and US 30; now Route 462). Service to Wrightsville ended in 1932 (or 1933) while the frequency increased to every 20 minutes between York and a station at Kershaw Street. East York&#x27;s fastest growth – the building of 167 houses – was in the 1930s. Bus service replaced the trolley in the 1940s, and the tracks were removed in the early 1950s when a fourth lane was added to East Market Street.

Other historic subdivisions in the township, and their years of development, include Fayfield (c. 1937 – c. 1986), Haines Acres (800 acres, 1954–1973), and Yorkshire. The York Suburban School District includes students from all of these neighborhoods and East York.

Springettsbury Township hosted a , Caterpillar manufacturing plant from 1953 until its closure in the 1990s, when the company continued operating a comparatively smaller parts distribution center.

The headquarters and distribution center of the former McCrory Stores chain was in Springettsbury Township from 1963. Founded in 1882, the stores filed for bankruptcy in 1992 and 2001, and the company ceased operation in early 2002.

===21st century===
The vacant former Caterpillar facility was acquired by a joint venture in 2002 for $9 million and received $50 million in redevelopment investments as the &quot;York Business Center&quot; before being sold at a profit in 2008. Primary tenants at that time included RR Donnelley and Bon-Ton Stores.

In late 2016, Post Consumer Brands filed plans to move into a newly built logistics center within the Harley-Davidson campus off Eden Road in the township. Expected to generate 70 jobs, Post was to occupy about 80 percent of the building, likely by January 2017, with the remainder available for lease by Post or other tenants. To be used for dry cereal storage, the warehouse has over 60 docks for shipping and receiving. Its builder declared the center&#x27;s construction complete on January 23, 2017.

Bon-Ton Stores employed 332 workers at its Springettsbury Township headquarters as of April 2018 before the department store chain closed in August 2018.

Hollywood Casino York opened in Springettsbury Township in August 2021. The casino has over 500 video poker and slot machines, a full-service restaurant, and Pennsylvania&#x27;s first retail Barstool Sportsbook location.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 16.7 square miles (43.4 km2), all land. Its western and northwestern boundaries (with Manchester and East Manchester Townships) are adjacent to Codorus Creek and its southwestern boundary (with Spring Garden Township) is along Mill Creek. Springettsbury Township&#x27;s southeastern border is with York and Windsor Townships and its northeastward-facing border is with Hellam Township.

The township includes the census-designated places of Pleasureville, East York, Yorklyn, and Stonybrook.

==Government==
Springettsbury Township is governed by a board of five supervisors who are elected at-large by voters for six-year terms. Supervisor terms are staggered and expire at the end of odd-numbered years. A Tax Collector and three Township Auditors are also elected by township voters at-large to six-year terms. A chairman and vice chairman are appointed among the Board of Supervisors.

Springettsbury Township is a municipal corporation organized under the Pennsylvania Second Class Township Code. The township has functioned under a Supervisor – Manager form of government since 1963. A Township Manager, who acts as the Chief Administrative Officer, is appointed by the Board of Supervisors. Various boards and commissions are also formed to address specific issues such as subdivision planning, zoning, recreation, historical preservation, and recycling. The Board of Supervisors appoints members to these boards and commissions.

Public meetings are regularly held at 7:00 p.m. on the second and fourth Thursdays of each month in the municipal complex at 1501 Mount Zion Road; exceptions are in June, July, and August (fourth Thursday only); November (third Wednesday only); and December (second Thursday only).

===Community services===
Springettsbury Township has been served historically by two volunteer fire companies: Commonwealth Fire Co. and Springetts Fire Co., both dating from the mid-1920s; in 2008 they joined forces with Spring Garden Township as part of a York Area United Fire and Rescue company. Emergency Medical Services are available via subscription program from White Rose Ambulance, since January 1, 2018. The township&#x27;s government maintains an active parks and recreation program, as well as a police force, both since 1958.

====Commonwealth Fire Company====
In January 1924, after a fire in the village of Pleasureville was put out via bucket brigade, a group of citizens met to discuss organization of a fire company. A committee was established and met on March 18, 1924, electing officers. Within two months, they had their first truck, and they dedicated their first firehouse on October 18, 1924. A second truck was added in 1942, a Ladies Auxiliary in 1949, and dining/social halls (each ) in 1952. Later additions included a pumper and two more firehouse bays in 1957; 24-hour/day, paid drivers in 1959; a pumper in 1965; and a rescue truck by 1969. In late 1969, plans began for a new firehouse, and of land along Sherman Street was purchased in March 1970. Building construction began in the second quarter of 1972, and the apparatus moved to the new building in May 1973.

====Springetts Fire Company====
When fire destroyed a large residence in the Yorkshire neighborhood on Christmas Eve 1925, organization of a local fire company, which had been under consideration by a few individuals, became a concern of the majority. A meeting in January 1926 resulted in organization of the Springetts Fire Company and election of officers. The first fire apparatus had chemical tanks, was built on a donated Buick chassis, included of hose, and was stored in an individual&#x27;s garage. Mahlon Haines, the main developer of the neighborhood, donated a plot of land that was used as part payment for a larger plot on the south side of Market Street. The $10,000 building on this property was completed in July 1931, and a Lady&#x27;s Auxiliary was later formed. The original fire apparatus was replaced with a new fire truck in 1938 and of hose. After a public meeting and sensing citizen support, the fire company bought a pumper in 1947 and a service truck was added in 1952.

A building committee was formed in January 1954 to begin planning for a new location. The ladies of the Commonwealth Fire Company helped with reorganization of a Ladies Auxiliary in October 1954. A building fund began in August 1955 and an ambulance was donated, spurring the formation of an ambulance club in March 1956 and ambulance service by July of that year; the ambulance club became a separate organization in November 1961. The township supervisors informed the fire company in November 1956 that they had acquired a piece of land, formerly owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad, as a new building location. After bids were taken in January 1958, contracts for nearly $75,000 were awarded for construction. One third of this amount was raised by the community and the rest was applied to a mortgage. The company sold its old firehouse at 2914 East Market Street and moved to its new location at 3013 East Market Street (farther east, on the north side) in November 1958.

The company joined the Fireman&#x27;s Association of York County in February 1961, and took delivery of new apparatus in March 1963. Construction of an expansion to the firehouse began in March 1967 and was complete in December of that year. The company took delivery of a new snorkel truck in 1970 and a pumper in June 1972. A second ambulance was added in 1972, and another building addition occurred in 1974. A new pumper to replace the 1962 model was received in February 1979. The township had begun paying for hired drivers in 1959, and they became township employees rather than fire company employees in 1975, eventually taking on more responsibilities and being classified as paid firefighters (working for both fire companies). Three full-time EMT personnel were hired in December 1978, and this number expanded to six by 1987.

====York Area United Fire and Rescue====
In June 2004, the Springettsbury Township supervisors and the Spring Garden Township commissioners formed an ad hoc committee to consider a combined fire service. A Joint Fire Service (JFS) committee first met in May 2005 to develop a framework. In 2006, a consulting firm was hired to provide a comprehensive plan. The plan, which received significant development assistance from the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development, was approved by the JFS committee in 2007. Both townships approved a charter amendment for creation of a fire commission to govern the new department, composed of seven commissioners drawn from the two townships. The first meeting of the York Area United Fire and Rescue Commission was held in September 2007, and a formal consolidation took place on May 5, 2008, establishing York County Company 89. In 2009, the department began selling and removing from service its excessive apparatus and replacing it with new, such as three pumpers with two 2010 models. In April 2010, the York Area United Fire and Rescue Commission and the International Association of Fire Fighters, Local 2377, signed the first joint contract for the department.

On July 10, 2013, ground was broken for the third location of a fire and EMS station in the eastern part of the township, to replace one built in 1958. At a cost of $3.8 million, the new 4-bay station opened in 2014 at 50 Commons Drive, an equally new road between Eastern Boulevard and East Market Street. The former property at 3013 Market Street was sold to a developer and its building torn down in 2015 for construction of a &quot;Firehouse Shoppes&quot; shopping center.

On January 1, 2018, Manchester Township&#x27;s fire services department officially merged with YAUFR after a gradual integration of services that began in 2010.

In February 2019, YAUFR had three new Spartan replacement fire engines whose purchase began in 2017. The vehicles have touchscreen controls, backup cameras, and LED lighting, and their design was customized by the department. The new equipment joins two other front-line fire engines, two ladder trucks, a heavy rescue vehicle, and two reserve engines.

====Parks and recreation====
The township Board of Supervisors resolved on February 6, 1958, to create a Park and Recreation Board. Its first Supervisor of Recreation was R. Bruce Bainbridge, who was still serving as of the township&#x27;s 100th anniversary in 1991. The original parks in 1958 were at Pleasureville, Yorkshire, East York, and Hiestand; there were 13 park locations by 1983 and 16 in 1991. The township now operates and maintains 11 parks covering a total of . The current park and recreation board has seven members with staggered four-year terms; they meet monthly except August and December. Most of the township parks include picnic shelters, grills, basketball courts, and playground areas.

====Police department====
The Springettsbury Township Police Department was established on February 9, 1958, with one police chief, one patrolman, and one police car. By 1991, the department had grown to 25 full-time officers, including 17 patrolmen. The department was accredited by the Pennsylvania Chiefs of Police Association in July 2006. In late 2015, the department joined others across the U.S. and opened &quot;safe zones&quot; at its station where online sales may be completed, such as with the exchange of items or money.

===State and U.S. representation===
Following 2021 redistricting, Springettsbury Township is represented by a state senator from District 28. The township&#x27;s local districts 02, 03, and 07 are within state house District 47; township districts 01, 04, 05, 06, and 08 are part of state house District 94. In January 2019, Springettsbury joined northwestern York County, Dauphin County and eastern Cumberland County, which are served by a U.S. House representative elected to a redrawn 10th congressional district. Its southern and western boundaries were modified again for January 2023.

==Employers==
According to Pennsylvania&#x27;s SouthCentral Workforce Investment Board, Springettsbury Township&#x27;s largest four employers as of 2008 were:
A 2010 URS Corporation &quot;Springettsbury Town Center Plan&quot; commissioned by the township identifies the manufacturing sector as the largest employer, with township residents tending to be in management rather than production. Retail jobs employed the second most residents, with their overall payroll less than a third of the manufacturing total.

==Education==
Springettsbury Township is served by the Central York and York Suburban School Districts. Public schools within the township borders include the following:
*Central York High School
*Central York Middle School (formerly North Hills Junior High)
*East York Elementary School
*North Hills Elementary School (opened 1957)
*Stony Brook Elementary School
*Yorkshire Elementary School
*York Suburban Middle School

Private schools within the township include YTI Career Institute&#x27;s York campus and a Goddard School. Until its closure in 2017, Springettsbury hosted The Art Institute of York – Pennsylvania.

===Former schools===

Public education in the township began with small schoolhouses, some with only one room. Seven such schools were: Miller&#x27;s, Stony Brook, Witmer&#x27;s, Glades, Mount Zion, Pleasureville, and Lefever&#x27;s; this last of which was torn down in 1912 and the Hiestand School built near Haines Road and Eastern Boulevard. Originally a two-room school, Hiestand was doubled to four rooms in 1927 and had six rooms by 1937. In 1946, the township&#x27;s Independent School District had a budget of $45,000 with five one-room schools; the Pleasureville school had four rooms. The Hiestand School and others from that district merged with the York Suburban School District when it was formed in 1955. The other schools in the township had become part of the Central Joint School District (now Central York) in 1952. Springettsbury Township School&#x27;s opening in September 1952 resulted in closure of all the one-room schools; one of them, Witmer&#x27;s School, had never received electricity service. Springettsbury Township School stopped enrolling new students in 1977, and the building was subsequently used by the York Technical School before being sold to the township for expansion of an adjacent park. The Hiestand School was closed in June 1978 for financial reasons and declining enrollment, and has been used by various community organizations. Pleasureville Elementary School closed in 1982.

== History ==
Spry was originally named Intersville, in honor of the individual who purchased the land on which the town now resides. The name was changed to Spry for reasons that remain unclear. This quaint town is notable for its robust cigar production during the early 1900s. If you were to ask locals about the boundaries of Spry, you’d likely receive a variety of answers. Commonly, residents believe the town begins near the Dunkin&#x27; Donuts on Queen Street and extends to the former site of Mack’s Ice Cream. Most of Spry’s homes were constructed between 1920 and 1960, predominantly featuring charming brick Cape Cods and ranch-style houses, alongside a smattering of newer constructions. The primary school district serving the area is Dallastown, with York Township Elementary being the sole school within Spry. This school was established between 1935 and 1945, replacing a former schoolhouse located near Spry Church, which was demolished around 1970 due to a decline in enrollment. Visitors to Spry quickly notice its vibrant array of small businesses, a defining characteristic of the town. After all, this entrepreneurial spirit is what truly sets Spry apart.

<text>Stewartstown is a borough in York County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,125 at the time of the 2020 census. It is part of the York–Hanover metropolitan area.

==History==
There were settlers in the Stewartstown area as early as 1750. This part of southern York County was claimed by both Maryland and Pennsylvania, and the boundary dispute was settled by the surveying of the Mason–Dixon Line in 1767.

By 1777, a road had been well established between York and Baltimore, and Stewartstown&#x27;s main street of today lies along a portion of the road. Around 1812, a group of farmers set out to establish a town in south central Hopewell Township. The earliest buildings were several houses, a workshop for making furniture and wheels, a store, and a tavern. Anthony Stewart, owner of the workshop, served as the village clerk, and his shop became the main meeting place.

The village was first known as Meadstown, after Benedict Meads, owner of the tavern and the store. Later it became known as Mechanicsburg because of a large number of tradesmen who lived in the community. By 1828, the town had its own post office, and Stewart was appointed the first postmaster. There was already another Pennsylvania town named Mechanicsburg, so postal officials assigned the name &quot;Guilford&quot; to the community. Through the efforts of Anthony Stewart, with the help of Judge Adam Ebaugh, the Post Office Department changed the town&#x27;s postmark to &quot;Stewartstown&quot; on March 24, 1832.

The Stewartstown Engine House, Stewartstown Railroad and Stewartstown Railroad Station are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>West York is a borough, adjacent to the City of York, in York County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 5,094 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Formally known as the village of Eberton, the Borough of West York was founded in 1904.

The Ashley and Bailey Company Silk Mill, William Shelly School and Annex, and West Side Sanitarium are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
West York is located at (39.953148, −76.759921).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

==Government==
West York Borough&#x27;s municipal government is composed of elected positions: Mayor Bruce Vick and seven borough council members.
The Borough&#x27;s Chief Administrator is former mayor Shawn Mauck. Mauck is the democratic mayor that ousted Charles Wasco. Mauck rallied council to censure Wasco.

Former mayor Charles Wasko attracted national notoriety in September 2016 for his racist Facebook posts depicting President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as orangutans and displaying a photo of a noose. Wasko also insulted Muslims and African Americans.

The West York borough council voted to censure Wasko, but had no power to throw him out of office. On October 18, 2016, it voted unanimously to accept his resignation.

==Police department==
The West York Borough Police Department (WYBPD), founded in 1917, is a full-time and full-service municipal law enforcement agency that provides 24-hour patrol, emergency response, and investigative functions within the confines of the Borough of West York. The ranking structure of the WYBPD is chief of police, sergeant, and patrolman. The WYBPD currently consists of 15 sworn police officers, and maintains a full-time patrol division, criminal investigative division, and special operations K-9 unit. The department uses Ford Interceptors and Ford Tauruses for patrol vehicles. The WYBPD also uses police-equipped mountain bicycles.

In 2013, the WYBPD completed a large-scale organized-crime investigation involving over 196 suspects engaged in felonious crimes in five Pennsylvania and two Maryland counties. The alleged ring leader was operating his criminal enterprise from a small storefront shop located along W. Market Street. This crime ring targeted over 90 retail chain stores in over 300 locations throughout this seven-county and multistate geographic area.

Per the crime statistics as compiled by the Pennsylvania State Police in 2019, the Borough of West York had the second-highest high crime rate per area in York County, yet their primary patrol duties are still traffic and parking enforcement.

==Fire department and EMS==

Fire protection for the borough is provided by the West York Fire Department (WYFD), which is administered by the borough and staffed by borough-paid fire Drivers. The drivers operate the borough-owned apparatus, which consists of one E-One ladder truck and one E-One engine.

They also inspect and issue occupancy licenses for all rental units and businesses. The paid drivers are members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and are represented by Local 776.

The Reliance Fire Company, established in 1904, is a separate entity, which is an all-volunteer fire company. The volunteer firefighters ride on and use the borough-owned apparatus, but they are not permitted to operate the equipment. The fire company owns and operates one Ford F250 (RITT) utility truck and one Chevrolet Tahoe as the duty-officer vehicle. The WYFD and Reliance Fire Company operate from the same facility.

<text>Windsor Township is a township in York County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 17,851 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Windsor Township was originally a part of Hellam Township, which was the original township of York County laid out by authority of the Provincial court at Lancaster in 1739. Windsor remained a part of Hellam Township until 1753 when a petition was presented to the court at York, signed by John Wright, Jr. asking that “Hallam Township be divided by a line on Stony Ridge, running across the valley to the next ridge of hills on the south side of Grist (Kreutz) Creek Valley, and also eastward along the last named ridge to the river Susquehanna.” This new township, York, included the current townships of Windsor, Lower Windsor, York and a portion of Spring Garden. Five years later, Windsor Township (which included Lower Windsor Township) formed out of York Township.

In April 1758, the following petition was presented at the April session of court: “We, your humble petitioners, hereby state that when the Townships of York and Hallam were in one, a division line was obtained which did not prove convenient or satisfactory; therefore we request that commissioners be appointed by your worshipfuls to lay off the new township.” The presiding justice, Thomas Armor, then appointed John Shultz, John Schyrack, Christian Shank and Michael Bart, to view and run the boundary line which was as follows:

: &quot;Beginning at the plantation of Peter Peterman, thence with the road to David Hunter’s, thence with the same to Shrewsbury Township (now Springfield and Hopewell), thence with the same township and the township of Chanceford to the Susquehanna, and up the same to Hallam Township, thence along the middle of that ridge of hills to Peter Peterman’s plantation and place of beginning, which last described township is to be called by the name of Windsor.&quot;

The name Windsor is attributed to Thomas Armor who was born in Windsor, England and was a large landowner, in addition to being the presiding justice at the creation of the township.

==History==
Townsend Winters, a resident of Steuben County, New York, purchased a four-hundred-acre tract of heavily forested land in York County, Pennsylvania, circa 1830, from the heirs of Reverend John Smith for two thousand dollars. After clearing portions of the land, Winters began work on building a house there and planted an apple orchard. As other settlers made their way to this area of the county, Winters cleared more of the land, and began sectioning it into individual lots, which he subsequently sold to the new arrivals. That first community, which would later become known as the Borough of Winterstown, was initially named Apple Grove in recognition of the thriving orchard that Winters had planted. Prior to completing work on his house, Winters then sold his home and land to Daniel Brenneman, who completed work on the structure, then built a blacksmith shop there.

The town of Apple Grove was renamed to Winterstown sometime thereafter and surveyed by William Norris. On January 2, 1871, it was officially incorporated as a borough.

<text>Wrightsville is a borough in York County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,257 at the time of the 2020 census. It is part of the York–Hanover metropolitan area.

== History ==

According to a plaque at Samuel S. Lewis State Park, which overlooks Wrightsville and the Susquehanna River, Wrightsville was among George Washington&#x27;s choices as the location of the capital of the United States.

The world&#x27;s longest covered bridge, at , once spanned the Susquehanna from Wrightsville to neighboring Columbia in Lancaster County. Built in 1814, it was destroyed by high water and ice in 1832. A replacement bridge was burned the night of June 28, 1863, by state militia during the Gettysburg Campaign in the American Civil War. Confederate troops under John Brown Gordon formed a bucket brigade to save the town from fire. Yet another replacement covered bridge was destroyed by a windstorm a few years later.

The final bridge, the Pennsylvania Railroad Bridge, was a steel open-air bridge constructed in 1896. It was razed in the early 1960s because of obsolescence and restructuring of the railroad industry. The site of the former bridge is now home of a concrete bridge known as Wright’s Ferry Bridge. The bridge standing today is approximately 100 yards north of the original bridge location

Wrightsville was the northern terminus of the Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal, which extended to Havre de Grace, Maryland.

In 2007, Wrightsville was the chosen location for the rekindling of the War of the Roses between the York Revolution and the Lancaster Barnstormers baseball teams. Wrightsville was chosen for its location on the Susquehanna River, the boundary between York and Lancaster counties.

The Columbia-Wrightsville Bridge and Wrightsville Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

=== Fire Department ===
Although fire protection in Wrightsville Borough can be traced back to the early 1800s, it wasn&#x27;t until 1887 that the Wrightsville Steam Fire Engine and Hose Company #1 (York County Station 41) was organized. The fire department protects nearly 10,000 citizens in Wrightsville Borough and Hellam Township with an all-volunteer staffing of over 30 active firefighters, as well as a support staff and a junior firefighter program (ages 14–17).

The Wrightsville Fire Department has been recognized by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania after meeting or exceeding the requirements set forth in the Voluntary Rescue Service Recognition Program. The Wrightsville Fire Department was also a participating department with the Commonwealth&#x27;s professional certification program in which over 95% of its members are trained to the National Proboard Firefighter 1 &amp; 2 certification levels. In 2019, the department responded to a total of 771 calls for service.

The department is located at 125 South Second Street in Wrightsville Borough. The current facility was completed in 1979, and houses four pieces of fire apparatus: a 1996 Seagrave rescue/pumper (Rescue 41–1), a 2005 Seagrave pumper (Engine 41), a 2005 Ford 550/Semo rescue (Rescue 41–2), and a 2018 Inmar inflatable rescue boat (Boat 41).

<text>York is a city in and the county seat of York County, Pennsylvania, United States. Located in South Central Pennsylvania, the city&#x27;s population was 44,800 at the time of the 2020 census, making it the tenth-most populous city in Pennsylvania. The city has an urban area population of 238,549 people and a metropolitan population of 456,438 people.

Founded in 1741, York served as the temporary base for the Continental Congress from September 1777 to June 1778, during which the Articles of Confederation were drafted. It is the largest city in the York–Hanover metropolitan area, which is also included in the larger Harrisburg–York–Lebanon combined statistical area of the Susquehanna Valley.

==History==
===18th century===


York was also known as Yorktown in the mid-18th to early 19th centuries. It was founded in 1741 by settlers from the Philadelphia region and named for the English city of the same name. By 1777, most of the area residents were of German or Scots-Irish descent. It was incorporated as a borough on September 24, 1787, and as a city on January 11, 1887.

York served as the temporary base for the Continental Congress from September 30, 1777, to June 27, 1778, during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). Congress drafted and adopted the Articles of Confederation in York, though they were not ratified until March 1781. Congress met at the Court House that was built in 1754. It was demolished in 1841 and rebuilt in 1976 as Colonial Court House.

York styles itself the first Capital of the United States, although historians generally consider it to be the fourth capital, after Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Lancaster (for one day). The claim arises from the assertion that the Articles of Confederation was the first legal document to refer to the colonies as &quot;the United States of America&quot;. The argument depends on whether the Declaration of Independence would be considered a true legal document of the United States, being drafted under and in opposition to British rule. This does not, however, prevent modern businesses and organizations in the York area from using the name, such as the First Capital Dispensing Co., First Capital Engineering and First Capital Federal Credit Union.

The Conway Cabal was a political intrigue against General George Washington that originated in the Golden Plough Tavern in York.

===19th century===
According to U.S. census reports from 1800 through 1840, York ranked within the nation&#x27;s top one hundred most populous urban areas.

During the American Civil War (1861–1865), York became the largest Northern town to be occupied by the Confederate army when the division of Major General Jubal Anderson Early spent June 28–30, 1863 in and around the town while the brigade of John B. Gordon marched to the Susquehanna River at Wrightsville and back. Early placed York under tribute status and collected food, supplies, clothing, shoes, and $28,000 in cash from citizens and merchants before departing westward, obeying the revised orders of Robert E. Lee.

The sprawling York U.S. Army Hospital on Penn Commons served thousands of Union soldiers who had been wounded during the battles of Antietam and Gettysburg.

During the Postbellum era (1865–1877), York remained a regional center for local agriculture, but increasingly became an important industrial center, with such industries as steam engines, railroad manufacturing, and papermaking achieving dominant status.

To this day, York still features unique architecture, ranging from colonial era buildings to large gothic churches.

===20th century===
The York Motor Car Co. built Pullman automobiles on North George St. from 1905 through 1917. An early and unique six-wheeled prototype was involved in one of the city&#x27;s first known automobile accidents. Another model was driven to San Francisco and back during roughly one month to prove its reliability several years prior to the creation of the Lincoln Highway which ran through town, connecting New York City and San Francisco.

The York area had also been home for more than 100 hundred years to the Pfaltzgraff company, which built its first pottery factory in the area in 1895 and continued manufacturing in York until 2005.

Although currently produced by the Hershey Company, the York Peppermint Pattie was created in York in 1940.

Throughout the middle of the 20th century, several incidents of racial prejudice and social injustices occurred in the city. Between 1955 and 1970 there were several racial disturbances, most notably the 1969 York Race Riot, which resulted in the deaths of Lillie Belle Allen and Henry C. Schaad. These murders were largely left ignored until thirty-one years later, when allegations of murder and racial prejudice were raised against the mayor, Charlie Robertson. Additionally, the city commonly held unopposed Ku Klux Klan rallies and public meetings, fostering further racial tension. Though the murders of Allen and Schaad were solved and the perpetrators were apprehended, the actions, which originated back to the beginnings of the hate group, continue to the present day.

===21st century===
In 2002, the city faced a budget shortfall of $1,000,000 (~$ in ). Mayor John S. Brenner&#x27;s plan to raise the money by asking York County&#x27;s 302,000 adult residents to donate $3.32 to the city received national attention. The plan, referred to by some as the &quot;Big Mac&quot; Plan, did not raise all of the funds sought.

After many years of attempting to secure funding for a stadium and a baseball team to play in it, the first decade of the century saw York realize both goals. In 2007, Santander Stadium (now WellSpan Park), home of the York Revolution, opened in the Arch Street neighborhood. The stadium, along with other large projects such as the York County Judicial Center and the Codo luxury apartment lofts, have come to symbolize York&#x27;s extensive redevelopment efforts.

Whiteley was an experienced ceramist who was familiar with the process of making artificial teeth. Whiteley was sent by the group to oversee the factory and his family presided over the factory for multiple generations.

In addition, Christmas Tree Hill, a popular national Christmas, home decor and gift retailer, has been based in York since its founding in 1971. Its flagship location is housed in the historic Meadowbrook Mansion, which was built in East York during the early 1800s. The six columns on the mansion&#x27;s front porch were reused from the second York County Courthouse cupola, which had been located at 28 East Market Street from 1841 until it was taken down in 1898 to make room for the third courthouse.

The city is also home to four national historic districts: Fairmount Historic District, Northwest York Historic District, Springdale Historic District, and York Historic District.

===Fairgrounds and vendors===
Much of York&#x27;s culture represents the city&#x27;s evolving role as an agricultural and industrial center. The historic York State Fair, which claims to be the country&#x27;s oldest, traces its roots to 1765. It runs every year in late July for ten days, encompassing an entire week and two weekends. In addition to typical fair attractions, such as rides, games and contests, it also wins regional recognition for hosting many musical artists, such as Alabama, Gretchen Wilson, Carrie Underwood, Toby Keith, and Lynyrd Skynyrd.

The fairgrounds, branded the York Expo Center, also hosts the annual National Street Rod Association Street Rod Nationals East, the largest annual street rod event in the Eastern US. The event brings thousands of street rods into the city for a few days in June. On Friday afternoons of the event, the city holds a parade through the center of the city for participating vehicles.

The historic Capitol Theatre also features many independent and foreign films, making it the only venue in York (and sometimes the entire Susquehanna Valley) to feature some rare, yet critically acclaimed films. The Strand Studio has also branched out and offers live music, usually jazz and acoustic, for the community. In 2017, DreamWrights underwent the largest renovation in its twenty-year history, adding a second performance space among other improvements.

===Heritage===
The York County History Center (YCHC) is a not-for-profit educational institution that preserves and uses its collections, historic sites and museums to encourage exploration of the history and culture of York County, Pennsylvania. YCHC maintains eight historical sites that demonstrate three hundred years of York County&#x27;s history. The YCHC was founded in 1999 after a merger of the Historical Society of York County and the Agricultural and Industrial Museum of York County (AIM). Currently, the YCHC historical sites include the Worker&#x27;s House, which was erected circa 1875, the Golden Plough Tavern, which was built sometime around 1741, the Barnett Bobb Log House, which was erected in 1812, the Bonham House, which was built circa 1885, and the old Eastern Market House, which was erected sometime around 1886.

In 1992, AIM acquired an industrial complex consisting of six buildings, which were built roughly between 1874 and 1955; three of the buildings were renovated and now house the industrial portion of the collection. The YCHC also hosts a variety of events throughout the year and holds the rights to the Murals of York, a group of paintings that depict York&#x27;s history.

The History Center also purchased a former Met-Ed steam plant in York in late 2015 and plans to turn it into a new history center. In 2016, what was the York County Heritage Trust rebranded as the York County History Center.

===Music===

The York Factory Whistle holds the world record for the loudest music without amplification from a non-musical instrument. Every Christmas Eve, the whistle uses a compressor to create air pressure, then releases it through a series of tubes using a device much like a slide whistle. (Prior to 2010, the pressure was created using steam produced by a boiler.) The music has had a loudness of 140 dB and can be heard ten to twelve miles away with proper weather conditions. Christmas music is played for a short time around midnight. It is thought that this annual tradition was started around 1925. Other sources date the tradition circa 1888 or earlier. The annual concert has been performed by members of the Ryan family since the 1950s. The factory whistle master since 1955 is Donald Ryan. 

After the New York Wire Cloth Company plant closed in 2013, Metso moved the whistle to its factory in York and continued the annual concert tradition. Metso announced in August 2015 that it would close its York plant by the end of March 2016. As of December 2017, the building was still owned by Metso and the annual twenty-five-minute York Factory Whistle Concert remained scheduled, along with two daytime rehearsal sessions.

By December 2018, the hosting factory building was owned by 240 Arch LLC, and the air compressor (to be moved there for rehearsals and the concert) was trailer-mounted. Another early Christmas concert and Saturday-before practice were announced for 2019.

The alternative rock band Live is from York. Many of Live&#x27;s songs are about the town including &quot;Shit Towne&quot; from their most successful album &quot;Throwing Copper&quot;.

===Baseball===
The York Revolution plays in the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. After thirty-six years without professional baseball, the Revolution arrived in 2007 to fill the void left by the departed York White Roses. The Revolution is named after the city&#x27;s colonial past, when the Continental Congress met in York and passed the Articles of Confederation during the Revolutionary War, and continues the old baseball rivalry between York and the nearby city of Lancaster. The Revolution plays at WellSpan Park in York&#x27;s Arch Street neighborhood, which features a plaza and statue in honor of MLB Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson, a one-time member of the aforementioned White Roses, with whom he made his professional baseball debut in 1955. Prior to his death, Robinson served as a special assistant and advisor to Opening Day Partners, the group largely responsible for bringing professional baseball back to York.

WellSpan Park has the distinction of having the tallest wall in baseball. At thirty-seven feet, eight inches, the left field wall of York&#x27;s ballpark surpasses the height of the Green Monster at Fenway Park, the home of the Boston Red Sox.

The War of the Roses All-Star Game is played in York every year over the weekend of Thanksgiving. The game pits the best high school football players in their senior seasons from the York-Adams League against a similar team from the Lancaster-Lebanon League. As the game only involves seniors and occurs during the first weekend of the PIAA District 3 football playoffs (players on teams which qualify for the playoffs do not participate), it is the final high school football game for each of the participants.

Norris stated that York was chosen due to its central location in a battleground state, its rich history (including its strained race relations), and demographics. On June 19, 2009, Norris announced on the air that she was taking time off to write a book inspired by her conversations &quot;with a diverse group of voters&quot; in York, and &quot;The Grace of Silence: A Memoir&quot; was published in September 2010.

In 2009, Kim Bracey won the Democratic primary and became the favored candidate for mayor.

===Transportation===
====Bus service====

York is served, through public transportation, by Rabbit Transit, which operates multiple bus routes in the city and the surrounding suburbs. In 2006, a Rabbit EXPRESS bus route was established to transport commuters to Harrisburg and back, making six round trips weekdays. Rabbit Transit introduced a new route on February 2, 2009, that provides three daily round trips between York and Timonium, Maryland. The $5 fare each way covers 80% of the operating costs.

The last &quot;Red Arrow&quot; bound for Detroit departed from York during the latter half of the 1950s. Rail advocates have suggested commuter rail service could be started between York and Philadelphia with much of the necessary infrastructure already in place, using SEPTA&#x27;s system. Transportation planners say this is too expensive, with bus and van services more feasible. The former Pennsylvania Railroad station for York now lies along the York County Heritage Rail Trail across from WellSpan Park.

<text>Warren is a town in Bristol County, Rhode Island, United States. The population was 11,147 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Warren was the site of the Pokanoket Indian settlement of Sowams located on a peninsula within the Pokanoket region. The region consisted of over 60 settlements under the authority of Chief Massasoit (sometimes called Osamequin) who controlled the land from Plymouth to the eastern shores of Narragansett Bay. English colonists Edward Winslow and Stephen Hopkins from Plymouth Colony first visited there in July, 1621. Winslow and John Hampden saved Massasoit&#x27;s life two years later and gained an important ally and lifelong friend. The colonists set up a trading post by 1632 on the banks of the Kickemuit River where they traded English goods for furs and other items. Roger Williams was banished from Salem, Massachusetts, in January, 1636, and fled to Sowams, becoming ill on the way. He was sheltered by Massasoit in Sowams until he recovered over the winter months; he later established Providence Plantations.

Permanent English settlement began east of the Indian village in 1653. Massasoit and his oldest son Wamsutta sold to Plymouth Colony settlers what is now Warren and parts of Barrington, Rhode Island, Swansea, Massachusetts, and Rehoboth, Massachusetts. The land was part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and was first incorporated as part of Swansea. After the death of Massasoit, however, relations became strained between the Indians and the settlers, leading to King Philip&#x27;s War in 1675 when the Indians destroyed the settlement at Sowams. In 1668, the township was officially incorporated with the name Sowams; in 1691, the Plymouth Colony merged with the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

Warren was ceded to Rhode Island from Massachusetts in 1747 along with the Attleborough Gore (now Cumberland), Barrington, Bristol, Tiverton, and Little Compton, Rhode Island. The town was named &quot;Warren&quot; after British naval hero Admiral Sir Peter Warren after a victory at Louisburg in 1745. Barrington was unified with Warren at the time, until it was separated again in 1770.

Warren was the original home of Brown University, founded in 1764 as the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. The school registered its first students in 1765 and was the Baptist answer to Congregationalist Yale and Harvard, Presbyterian Princeton, and Episcopalian Penn and Columbia. It was the only one of these schools that welcomed students of all religious persuasions, following the example of Roger Williams, who founded Rhode Island in 1636 on the same principle.

In the mid-18th century, the town was well known as a whaling port, and ship building became an important industry. The American Revolutionary War seriously affected Warren&#x27;s commercial prosperity, and the town was subject to British raids in 1778 along with the rest of the region. Commerce revived within the decade after the Revolution until the middle of the 19th century, and Warren was famous for the fine vessels launched from its yards. These vessels were largely commanded and operated by Warren crews, and they engaged in whaling, merchant service, and the West India trade. Three notable ships were built in Warren by Chase &amp; Davis: the 1853 clipper &quot;Lookout&quot;, the 1853 clipper bark &quot;Gem of the Sea&quot;, and the 1854 clipper bark &quot;Mary Ogden&quot;.

With the decline of the whaling industry and related seafaring commerce toward the middle of the 19th century, business attention turned to textile manufacturing. Warren&#x27;s first cotton mill was erected by the Warren Manufacturing Company in 1847. Further mills and factories developed during and after the Civil War, attracting an immigrant work force. Today, Warren is home to several waterfront businesses such as Blount Marine, Blount Seafood, and Dyer Boats.

<text>Coventry is a town in Kent County, Rhode Island, United States. The population was 35,688 at the 2020 census and is part of the .

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of . of it is land and of it (4.49%) is water. The town is bordered by West Warwick to the east, Foster, Scituate, and Cranston to the north, West Greenwich and East Greenwich to the south, and Sterling, Connecticut, to the west. It is the largest town in land area in Rhode Island, being surpassed in total area only by South Kingstown, Rhode Island, with water and land area of .

==Climate==

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Coventry has an oceanic climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfb&quot; on climate maps.

== History ==

Coventry was first settled by English colonists in the early 18th century, when the town was part of Warwick. Since the area was so far away from the center of Warwick, the section that became Coventry grew very slowly. However, by 1741, enough farmers (about 100 families) had settled in the area that they petitioned the General Assembly of Rhode Island to create their own town. The petition was granted, and the new town was named &quot;Coventry&quot;, after the English city. For the rest of the 18th century, Coventry remained a rural town populated by farmers. Among the buildings that survive are the Waterman Tavern (1740s), the Nathanael Greene Homestead (1770), and the Paine Homestead (late 17th century/early 18th century). The oldest church, Maple Root Baptist Church, dates from the end of the 18th century. The congregation was organized in 1762 and was affiliated with the General Six-Principle Baptists.

During the Revolutionary War, the people of Coventry were supporters of the patriot cause. Nathanael Greene, a resident of Coventry, rose through the ranks to become a leading general of the American army. By the end of the war, Greene was second in command in the US army after George Washington.

In the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution came to Coventry with the building of the first mill in Anthony. Over the next century, the eastern end of town became very industrialized, with manufacturing centers being located in Anthony, Washington, Quidnick, and Harris villages. Many of the old factories still stand in the town, and the village centers (in particular, Anthony and Quidnick) remain mostly intact. The demographics of the town changed, as industrial jobs at these new mill villages attracted French Canadian and Irish immigrants. By the end of the 19th century, almost one fourth of the population was born outside the US, and French was the primary language for many of the people in the eastern part of Coventry. Not all immigrants worked in the factories. Census records from the late 19th century show that some owned farms.

By comparison, the western end of the town remained very rural, with the only centers of population being located at Greene and Summit, both established as railroad stations on the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.

In the 20th century, the town went through much change. The advent of the automobile brought an end of the railroad. (The track was dismantled in the 1970s, and in the early 21st century, the right of way was revitalized as the Washington Secondary Rail Trail/Greenway). By the mid-20th century, industry had largely left the town and most of the factories closed.

Since the late 20th century, the town has attracted new residents, and the eastern part of the town became suburbanized. In the early 21st century, a movement in the town has developed to limit residential development to keep the rural flavor of the western part of the town.

== Recreation ==

Coventry offers a few recreation facilities. The town has youth sport leagues for football (boasting the 2006 American Youth Football National title), basketball, baseball, and softball. Carbuncle Pond off Route 14 (Plainfield Pike) near the Connecticut border is a pond that is popular for freshwater fishing. Johnson&#x27;s Pond, a waterfront neighborhood, houses facilities for fishing and watersports. &quot;Wakeboarding Magazine&quot; rated Johnson&#x27;s Pond as the best location for wakeboarding in Rhode Island. The George B. Parker woodland, owned by the Audubon Society of Rhode Island, offers several hiking trails. The woodland caretaker&#x27;s home dates from the mid 18th century. 

The town has been investing in the Coventry Greenway, a pedestrian and bicycle path built on the old New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad right-of-way and part of the East Coast Greenway, a trail running from Maine to Florida. The Coventry Greenway travels from the Connecticut state line to the West Warwick town line. The greenway has recently undergone a massive renovation and has reopened to the public as a walking, cycling, and horse trail.

On the eastern side of town, many homes from the 19th century can be found, ranging from the two-family mill workers residence to mansions owned by the town elites. The village of Greene and the Rice City and Hopkins Hollow parts of town have remained unchanged since the 19th century. Also, many of the churches in Coventry date from the 19th century and are still functioning churches.

<text>East Greenwich is a town and the county seat of Kent County, Rhode Island. The population was 14,312 at the 2020 census. East Greenwich is the wealthiest municipality within the state of Rhode Island. It is part of the Providence metropolitan statistical area and the Greater Boston combined statistical area.

Formed as Greenwich in 1677, it was named for Greenwich, England. It was renamed Dedford in 1686 but reverted to its original name in 1689. In 1741 the more rural western three quarters of the town was set off as West Greenwich, the remaining quarter of it thenceforth being called East Greenwich. Until 1854, it was one of the five state capitals for Rhode Island. The General Assembly, when meeting in East Greenwich, used the local courthouse, which is today the town hall. East Greenwich Village is located in the northeastern part of the town and extends north about into the city of Warwick, Rhode Island. The town is now known for its waterfront, school district, and downtown restaurant/shopping district.

==History==
East Greenwich, the 8th oldest town in Rhode Island, was founded in October 1677 by the General Assembly in an attempt to solidify land claims against those of Connecticut and the Narragansett Proprietors. The Assembly designated 5,000 acres to the new town and provided lots to settlers who would agree to live there—land was deeded to 48 men who had fought in King Phillip&#x27;s War against the Wampanoag. Locals quickly took the assembly up on this offer, and the quick establishment of the town helped hold back plans of Connecticut in pushing their border eastward. East Greenwich was therefore the only Rhode Island town established by an act of government, not commercial interests. In 1687, the Narragansett Proprietors attempted to settle land north of Wickford which overlapped with the land of East Greenwich; however, the Massachusetts governor Sir Edmund Andros, who had authority to settle the dispute, ruled in favor of the existing East Greenwich settlement.

In the 18th century, the government released previously reserved waterfront property in small lots. Beginning in 1711, the local government granted these lots to any person who would pay one shilling and promise to build a commercial building of a minimum size. By 1725, a community had developed, complete with a schoolhouse and a graveyard. However, citizens of the town complained that attending town meetings was too difficult due to the size of the town, which prompted the splitting of West Greenwich into its own town in 1741. The town erected a courthouse when East Greenwich was designated the shire town of the newly formed Kent County, which had been separated from Providence County in 1750. On June 12, 1772, a resolution was passed by the Rhode Island State Assembly to form the United States&#x27; first Navy in East Greenwich, which included two ships, the Katy and the Washington. The Assembly put Captain Abraham Whipple in charge of this new military branch and these ships, with the formal title commodore.

In its colonial days, the town was also home to followers of a former Quaker who, after a severe illness, claimed to have died and been resurrected as the &quot;Public Universal Friend&quot;; these followers financed a meeting house within the town.

===Scalloptown===
In the 19th Century, East Greenwich attracted a wave of immigrants from Ireland, Italy, Germany, and Scandinavian countries, as well as free Blacks. Many settled in a small community which came to be known as Scalloptown, as many residents made a living from fishing and selling scallops. As it grew, the neighborhood of immigrants and mixed ethnicities developed a reputation as a &quot;shantytown&quot; of &quot;low and lawless nature&quot; by white writers and community leaders. The neighborhood&#x27;s height was from 1890 to 1913. In 1913, the town council condemned many of the residences of Scalloptown as unfit for habitation. Currently, only one shellfish processing business remains on the street.

Most of East Greenwich&#x27;s neighborhood of Scalloptown was destroyed by 1926, after a mass eviction order by the town council left most of its buildings vacant. Scalloptown had been the attention of reformers in town for some time. Scalloptown was the site of &quot;Neighborhood House&quot;, a settlement house run by Sarah Fernandis from 1908 on. But, historian Catherine Streich argues, the racial prejudices of white East Greenwich residents and their dwindling desire for social reform led to their destruction of Scalloptown.

==Geography==
East Greenwich is a coastal town, located on the western side of Narragansett Bay. Of its total area of 16.71 square miles, 16.58 square miles is land and 0.14 square miles is water. 20 percent of the land in East Greenwich consists of undeveloped woods and farmland, although development continues to bring this proportion down.

Various roads form approximate borders with some of its neighboring towns. Division Street sits between East Greenwich and Warwick, to the north and west until Route 2. South and east is North Kingstown which is roughly separated from East Greenwich by Frenchtown Road.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, East Greenwich has either a hot-summer humid continental climate (abbreviated &quot;Dfa&quot;), or a hot-summer humid sub-tropical climate (abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot;), depending on the isotherm used.

==Schools==
East Greenwich is home to six public schools in its school district. The district contains two zoning districts for its elementary schools. Students in one district, which primarily consists of households east of South County Trail, attend Meadowbrook Farms Elementary from kindergarten to second grade, then proceed to George R. Hanaford School for third grade to fifth grade. Most students who live west of South County Trail will attend Frenchtown Elementary for kindergarten to second grade before attending James H. Eldredge School for third grade to fifth grade. All students in the public school district then attend Archie R. Cole Middle School for sixth grade to eighth grade. The district&#x27;s single high school is East Greenwich High School.

In 2015, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine ranked East Greenwich High School first in Rhode Island and 186th in the United States.

The town also contains the Our Lady Of Mercy Regional School a private Catholic school serving students from pre-kindergarten to eighth grade. East Greenwich was also home to the East Greenwich Academy, an eminent preparatory school; however, the school closed in 1943.

East Greenwich is also home to the main campus of the New England Institute of Technology, known informally as New England Tech. The site was purchased by the school in 2007, and opened to students in summer 2011. A major expansion begun in 2014 added dormitories and new instructional space. The campus includes a 265,000 square foot facility dedicated to classrooms, technical labs, medical suites for training simulations, and administrative services.

==Library==

The current East Greenwich Free Library, at 82 Pierce Street, was endowed by Daniel Albert Peirce in 1913. Pierce was a local resident and co-founder of the Narragansett Electric Company. The library building is built of granite from Coventry, Rhode Island, and was dedicated on June 29, 1915. The library includes special collections on Rhode Island history and genealogy.

==Waterfront==
Many restaurants, bars, and clubs sit on the waterfront. East Greenwich Cove also has ample boat parking. There is also a public dock good for fishing and eating, and a dock with a small beach. Across from the coast is Goddard Memorial State Park, which has many beaches including Sandy Point and has easy access from East Greenwich Cove.

Scalloptown Park has been completed at the southern end of Greenwich Cove, built atop the old town landfill. However, it is not part of historical Scalloptown, which was another name for the waterfront in earlier times. Home to a poor community of squatters in the late nineteenth century to the earliest twentieth century, Scalloptown became a community untethered from the rest of East Greenwich. In contrast to the other villages in East Greenwich, Scalloptown consisted primarily of poor whites and African Americans. The true Scalloptown goes from the town dock down past the clubs to Finn&#x27;s Marina.

==Government==
In the Rhode Island Senate, East Greenwich is split in terms of representation. Most of the town is in the 35th District, currently represented by Democrat Bridget Valverde, while a tiny sliver of the northwestern quadrant of the town is in the 33rd District, which is currently represented by Democrat Leonidas P. Raptakis. In the Rhode Island House of Representatives, East Greenwich is in the 30th district represented by Democrat Justine Caldwell. At the federal level, all of East Greenwich is included in Rhode Island&#x27;s 2nd congressional district and is represented by Democrat Seth Magaziner.

Barack Obama managed to carry the town by just over 4.5 points in the Democratic wave year of 2008 and in 2020, Joe Biden won East Greenwich by just over 23 points, marking the best performance for a Democratic presidential nominee in the town in over three decades. Biden also became the first major party candidate to win over sixty percent of the vote in the town since also then vice president George H. W. Bush.

<doc id="134312" wikidata="Q49195" url="?curid=134312" title="Warwick, Rhode Island">
<text>Warwick ( or ) is a city in Kent County, Rhode Island, United States, and is the third-largest city in the state, with a population of 82,823 at the 2020 census. Warwick is located approximately south of downtown Providence, Rhode Island, southwest of Boston, Massachusetts, and northeast of New York City.

Warwick was founded by Samuel Gorton in 1642 and has witnessed major events in American history. It was decimated during King Philip&#x27;s War (1675–1676) and was the site of the Gaspee Affair, the first act of armed resistance against the British, preceding even the Boston Tea Party, and a significant prelude to the American Revolution. Warwick was also the home of Revolutionary War General Nathanael Greene, George Washington&#x27;s second-in-command, and Civil War General George S. Greene, a hero of the Battle of Gettysburg. 

Today, it is home to Rhode Island&#x27;s main airport, T. F. Green Airport, which serves the Providence area and also functions as a reliever for Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts. Warwick was also home to Rocky Point, which closed in 1995 and is now a state park.

==Early history==
Warwick was settled by Samuel Gorton in 1642. Narragansett Sachem Miantonomi sold him the Shawhomett Purchase for 144 fathoms of wampum. This included the towns of Coventry and West Warwick, Rhode Island. However, Sachems Sacononoco and Pumham claimed that Miantonomi had sold the land without asking for their approval. They took their case to Boston, where they placed their lands under Massachusetts rule. In 1643, Massachusetts Bay Colony sent a militia force to Shawomett to arrest Gorton and his followers. After a tense standoff, all but three of the Gortonists surrendered to the Massachusetts forces. Gorton then sailed back to England and sought a charter from the King. He was greatly assisted in gaining it by Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, so Gorton and his fellow settlers changed the name of their colony from Shawumet to Warwick.

The ongoing harassment from Massachusetts Bay Colony, however, caused the other three colonies on Narragansett Bay (Providence Plantations, Portsmouth, and Newport) to unite with Warwick and get a British royal charter allowing them to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.

In 1772, Warwick was the scene of the first violent act against the British Crown in the &quot;Gaspee&quot; Affair. Local patriots boarded the &quot;Gaspee&quot;, a revenue cutter that enforced the Stamp Act 1765 and Townshend Acts in Narragansett Bay. It was here that the first blood was spilled in the American Revolution when &quot;Gaspee&#x27;s&quot; commanding officer Lt. Dudingston was shot and seriously wounded during the struggle for the ship. The &quot;Gaspee&quot; was stripped of all cannons and arms, then burned.

During the Revolution, Warwick militiamen participated in the battles of Montreal, Quebec, Saratoga, Monmouth, and Trenton, and they were present for the British surrender at Yorktown in 1781.

==Transportation==

Major traversing highways include: 
* Interstate 95
* Interstate 295

<text>Jamestown is a town in Newport County, Rhode Island, United States. The population was 5,559 at the 2020 census. Jamestown is situated almost entirely on Conanicut Island, the second largest island in Narragansett Bay. It also includes the uninhabited Dutch Island and Gould Island.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has an area of , of which is land and is water. The total area is 72.55% water.

Rhode Island Route 138 is the only state highway in Jamestown, connecting the town and island to North Kingstown to the west (over the Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge) and Newport to the east (over the Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge).

==History==

In 1524, Italian navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano and his crew visited Narragansett Bay. Dutch Island was used by fur traders , and English colonists in 1638 made arrangements with the native Americans to use Conanicut Island for grazing sheep.

Ferries were in operation between Conanicut Island and Newport by 1675. In 1678, Conanicut Island was incorporated as the town of Jamestown, when there were about 150 residents. It was named for James, Duke of York, who became King James II in 1685.

By 1710, many of Conanicut Island&#x27;s current roads were in place. In 1728, the town of Jamestown built a windmill for grinding corn, which used the sea breeze for power since there was no source of running water to turn a waterwheel.

===American Revolution===
Two hundred British and Hessian troops, commanded by James Wallace, landed at East Ferry on Conanicut Island on December 10, 1775. They then marched to West Ferry where they burned the ferry house. As they returned to East Ferry, they destroyed many buildings, including 14 homes, which caused more than 200 of Conanicut Island&#x27;s 556 residents to flee to the mainland.

In December 1776, a British fleet arrived in Narragansett Bay and occupied Newport. The British took over the colonial militia batteries at Fort Dumpling (now part of Fort Wetherill) and the Conanicut Battery at Beavertail, just south of Fort Getty at the end of Battery Lane. They left Narragansett Bay in October 1779; as they departed, they destroyed the fortifications which they had occupied and burned down the Beavertail Lighthouse.

===18th and 19th centuries===
Beavertail Lighthouse was back in operation by 1784, and Jamestown rebuilt the Jamestown Windmill and Quaker Meetinghouse in 1787 that had been destroyed during the occupation.

In 1800, Fort Dumpling was established on the site of previous fortifications overlooking East Passage. A tall stone tower atop the highest cliff could hold eight guns.

The town of Jamestown commissioned a steam-powered ferryboat in 1872 and initiated service between Jamestown and Newport in May 1873. The availability of reliable and comfortable ferry service to and from Newport had a significant impact on agricultural Conanicut Island, and Jamestown became a destination for both day trips and summer vacations.

The 1880s and 1890s saw a construction boom, with hotels, private summer homes, and municipal buildings going up. The island&#x27;s population tripled between 1870 and 1900.

===20th century to the present===
There was a burst of military fortification activity from 1890 to the end of World War I. The Spanish–American War was a catalyst, beginning in 1898, and work began on Dutch Island&#x27;s Fort Greble. The War Department bought for Fort Getty, and fortifications were quickly erected. Summer homes were condemned near Fort Dumpling to establish Fort Wetherill. More land was acquired at Prospect Hill near the Conanicut Battery site for an observation and fire control station, and the government established a torpedo station and test facility on Gould Island. Then, at the end of the First World War, the Conanicut Island fortifications fell into disuse. World War II brought establishment or reactivation of military bases around Narragansett Bay, including Forts Getty, Burnside, and Wetherill on Conanicut Island, Fort Greble on Dutch Island, a torpedo factory on Goat Island, and a torpedo station on Gould Island.

Jamestown was a bustling summer destination in the early 1900s, and it had nine hotels in 1903. The golden age of large resort hotels was brief, however, in Jamestown and elsewhere, and patronage rapidly declined in the 1920s. The Thorndike Hotel was demolished in 1938. The Gardner House was one of the larger hotels, but it was taken down in 1941 after being idle for several years, and a USO building was built on its site. After the war, the town purchased the building and it is now known as the community center. It was extensively landscaped and remodeled in 2002. The Bay View Hotel closed in the 1960s, the last of the very large hotels. The building was demolished in 1985, and the Bay View Condominiums opened for occupancy four years later. The building exterior was designed to resemble the hotel. The Bay Voyage Hotel is the only survivor of the many hotels that once lined Jamestown&#x27;s eastern harbor, now operating as a time share resort.

In 1938, a major hurricane caused much property damage and the loss of more than 300 lives in the Narragansett Bay region. It swept away much of the sand from the Mackerel Cove beach, destroyed its popular beach pavilion, and destroyed the West Ferry docks—which actually speeded approvals for a bridge to Saunderstown. The first Jamestown Bridge opened in the summer of 1940, replacing West Ferry service with a continuously available link to the west.
In 1969, the Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge was completed, establishing Route 138 as a continuous highway from South County to Newport. With its completion, traditional ferry service was eliminated. The bridge is pictured on the 2001 Rhode Island state quarter. In 1992, the Jamestown-Verrazano Bridge replaced the narrow steel bridge erected in 1940. It was accompanied by construction of a new western-end access road and a cross-Conanicut Island highway.

<doc id="134315" wikidata="Q2448539" url="?curid=134315" title="Little Compton, Rhode Island">
<text>Little Compton is a coastal town in Newport County, Rhode Island, United States, bounded on the south by the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by the Sakonnet River, on the north by the town of Tiverton, and on the east by the town of Westport, Massachusetts. The population was 3,589 as of 2022 Town Records. However, during the summer months the population nearly doubles due to the tourist aspect of the town.

Little Compton was originally inhabited by the Sakonnet Indians and their settlement was called Sakonnet or Saughonet. The name has been interpreted in a variety of ways including &quot;where the water pours forth&quot;.

The first European settlers were from Duxbury, Massachusetts in the Plymouth Colony, which granted them their charter. The ruler of the Native Americans was a female sachem named Awashonks who was friendly to the newcomers and remained so during and after King Phillip&#x27;s War. With her acquiescence, the new settlers divided the land into standard-sized lots for farms. Among the 29 original proprietors was Colonel Benjamin Church, who would become well known for his role in the late 17th-century conflicts with surrounding Indian tribes, initially the Wampanoags and later, the Narragansetts. In 1675, Church built a house in Little Compton, just prior to King Philip&#x27;s War. Today, a plaque marks the location on West Main Road.

In 1682, Sakonnet was incorporated by the Plymouth Colony and was renamed Little Compton, presumably in reference to Little Compton in Warwickshire, England. After the &quot;Old Colony&quot; was merged into the Massachusetts Bay Colony to the north, a local colonial representative to the General Court in Boston boasted that all the stone walls in Little Compton would stretch to the State House and back, if laid end to end. A Royal commission changed the state border in 1747, and Little Compton along with Tiverton and Bristol became part of Rhode Island, setting them off from the area of Old Dartmouth. All probate and land records prior to 1746 are kept in Taunton and New Bedford, Massachusetts. Beginning in the late Victorian era, the town became a destination for summer visitors drawn to its beaches and farms seemingly untouched by modernity, and for its relatively cool, maritime climate.

== Historic sites ==
Sites of historic interest in Little Compton include the Wilbor House, built in 1692 by Samuel Wilbore (1664–1740) (grandson of Samuel Wilbore), and now the home of the Little Compton Historical Society, the Friends Meeting House and Cemetery, and the William Whalley Homestead. There are about 57 historic cemeteries in the town.

Little Compton is home to one of only three town commons surviving in Rhode Island; the others are in Bristol and Warren. Land for the common was designated in August 1677 and has been used ever since as both a religious and civic center, the location of churches, a school, the town hall, town library, and other government buildings and civic institutions. The Common contains a large cemetery. Benjamin Church and his family are buried in the cemetery, as is Elizabeth Pabodie, the eldest daughter of John Alden and Priscilla Mullins of Mayflower fame. The stones in the cemetery reflect a style of carving similar to that found both in Newport and Boston during the same time period. The entire common is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as an historic district.

Another distinctive feature of the town is the c.1905 &quot;Spite Tower&quot; found in the hamlet of Adamsville. Built as a water tower, local lore claims that it was constructed to obscure the sight-lines of a rival abutting neighbor.

The Sakonnet Point Lighthouse is situated off the coast of Sakonnet Point in the southwest corner of Little Compton; the lighthouse was constructed in 1884 and was extensively restored in 2012.

The West Island Club was a prestigious sport fishing club that formerly occupied West Island, which is located roughly half a mile (0.8 km) south off the coast of Sakonnet Point. The exclusive club operated between 1864 and 1906, with notable members including the likes of Grover Cleveland, J.P. Morgan and Cornelius Vanderbilt. The remaining structures on the island were destroyed by the Hurricane of 1938, save for three stone support columns that are still extant.

Fort Church was built near Sakonnet Point during World War II and was named for Benjamin Church. The largest of the four batteries was Battery Gray with two 16-inch guns, an area that became the Sakonnet Golf Club.

==Demographics==

In 2021, there were 3,600 people in 1,592 households. Of the 2,444 housing units in Little Compton in 2021, only 65% were reported as occupied, leaving 855 units (35%) vacant for seasonal use only.

The population density of Little Compton was 175 people per square mile, which classifies as rural. In 2021, 98% of residents were White, 2% were Hispanic or Latino. More than half (59%) had earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, which was 1.5 times greater than the rate of Rhode Island (34%). The median age in town was 58 years, considerably older than Rhode Island as a whole (40 years). The largest plurality of people (21% of the town) was between the ages of 60–69. And the largest plurality of residents moved to town in 2015 or later (28%). Only 2% of the town&#x27;s population was under 10 years of age, far below the statewide average of 10%, and zero percent of women of childbearing age (ages 15–50) gave birth in 2021.

In 2022, the median value of owner occupied units was $797,000, more than double the value in Rhode Island as a whole ($319,000). A household needed an annual income of $174,000 to afford a median priced home in Little Compton, placing the town among the three most expensive zip codes in Rhode Island, ranking third most expensive behind only Block Island (New Shoreham) and Providence (East Side).

As of 2021, the median household income in Little Compton was $96,111, which was 1.3 times higher than Rhode Island ($74,489). The per capita income in Little Compton was $81,912, more than double that of Rhode Island ($39,603). Of Little Compton&#x27;s households, 416 (or 27%) were classified as cost-burdened for having to spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs. About 4.8% of the population lived below the poverty line, which was less than half the rate of Rhode Island (12.4%).

Rhode Island State Law 45-5356 establishes a goal that 10 percent of every city or town&#x27;s housing stock qualify as Low- and Moderate-Income Housing. In 2022, only 0.56% of Little Compton&#x27;s housing stock qualified as meeting that goal, the lowest of any municipality in Rhode Island, leaving Little Compton as the most unaffordable town in Rhode Island and 235 units shy of the state target of 10 percent.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, is land and (27.79%) is water. One of the largest bodies of fresh water in Little Compton is Quicksand Pond. Sakonnet Point is the town&#x27;s southernmost point, offering views of the Sakonnet Point Lighthouse and several small rocky islands, including East Island and West Island. On a clear day, it is possible to view the inhabited islands of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Cuttyhunk and Nashawena in Buzzards Bay, as well as Newport, Rhode Island to the west.

Along with its scenic coastline, another defining feature of Little Compton&#x27;s landscape is its abundant stonewalls. According to Bruce Irving, author of the book &quot;New England Icons&quot;, &quot;There were once some 250,000 miles of stone walls in the Northeast, enough to stretch to the moon, their epicenter generally sited in a fifty-mile radius around the meeting point of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, with the Rhode Island town of Little Compton especially rich in stone walls.&quot;

At times, Little Compton has been considered a part of the South Coast region of Massachusetts despite the town residing entirely within Rhode Island. By its most literal definition, the South Coast encompasses the geographic area of Massachusetts that borders Buzzards Bay (excluding the Elizabeth Islands, Bourne and Falmouth), Mount Hope Bay and the Sakonnet River. It has been argued that Little Compton and Tiverton share more in common with the regional identities of the South Coast communities of Westport and Dartmouth (and to an extent Fall River) than the rest of Newport County. 

In recent years, Little Compton has also been included within a sub-region of the South Coast known as the Farm Coast which consists of several surrounding rural towns that are considered the last coastal farming communities left in Southern New England.

=== Localities ===

There are several localities located in Little Compton, however, none are considered census-designated places: Adamsville, Pottersville, the Commons, Sakonnet, Warren Point and Chase Point. Adamsville is a village situated in the northeast corner of Little Compton and overlaps with the towns of Tiverton and Westport in Rhode Island and Massachusetts respectively. Adamsville is the only locality in Little Compton that has its own regional post office. Pottersville is a sparsely settled hamlet located south of Adamsville and is concentrated at the junction of Pottersville Road, John Dyer Road and Mullin Hill Road.

The Little Compton Commons encompasses the area that includes and surrounds the historic town common. The majority of Little Compton&#x27;s civic buildings are located in the Commons, and the town hosts many events in this area. The Sakonnet neighborhood consists of the area located within and surrounding Sakonnet Point, which is situated at the mouth of the Sakonnet River. Several exclusive leisure clubs are located at Sakonnet Point - this includes the Sakonnet Golf Club, the Sakonnet Yacht Club and the Sakonnet Point Club.

Warren Point is located east of Sakonnet Point and is composed of residential waterfront properties; the exclusive Warren&#x27;s Point Beach Club is located at Tappens Beach on Warren Point. Chase Point is located at the southeastern point of Little Compton and is composed of private roadways and residential properties which occupy former sheep pastures.

=== Beaches ===
There are five beaches in Little Compton; however, only two are permitted for public use. South Shore Beach and Goosewing Beach, which are located adjacent to each other, are considered the only public beaches in Little Compton. South Shore Beach requires either a season pass, day pass, or proof of residency for parking access.

Briggs Beach and Tappens Beach are private beach clubs and are only permitted for members and their guests. Briggs Beach is located adjacent to Briggs Marsh and offers amenities such as changing rooms and parking. Tappens Beach is the shoreline property for the Warren&#x27;s Point Beach Club which offers concessions, parking and changing rooms for members.

Lloyd&#x27;s Beach, a gravel beach located near Sakonnet Point, is only accessible to residents of the surrounding Sakonnet neighborhood and requires proof of residency for entry.

== Agricultural Conservancy Trust ==

Little Compton is unique for its real estate transfer tax, which was enabled by state statute in 1985 to preserve farmland in town and protect limited drinking water resources from overdevelopment. Effective July 1, 2016, real estate property transfers are taxed at a 4% rate, with the first $300,000 is exempted, paid by the buyer in the transaction to the town&#x27;s Agricultural Conservancy Trust. As of 2021, the Ag Trust has preserved 2,162 acres of land, more than 671 acres of that owned outright by the Ag Trust, with 133 acres of that leased to local farmers.

Easements are emplaced on Agricultural Conservancy Trust property which allows public access on preserved land in the form of maintained public rights-of-way; this is a unique practice that is not often seen in the United States and is more commonly associated with English Law.

==Education==

There is one school in Little Compton, the Wilbur and McMahon School on School House Lane near the Common, originally known as the Josephine Wilbur (or Central) School; residents simply refer to it as &quot;Wilbur School.&quot; It had 12 classrooms and housed the town&#x27;s K–12 facilities. It was renamed after additions were built in the mid 1900s. Approximately 208 students attend classes in Kindergarten through 8th grade. High school students usually attend Portsmouth High School in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, about a 25 minute drive away, as well as other options like Bishop Stang High School in Dartmouth, Massachusetts. The school has 2 floors; one for Elementary and the second floor for 4-8. The biggest room in the Wilbur McMahon School is the Gymnasium or historically, &quot;Mr Mac&#x27;s Gym.&quot; Followed by the Art Room until further renovations were made in Late 2023 to construct a conjoined Spanish and Design room. The school also implements the International Baccalaureate or, (IB) Program. Wilbur School is the only Middle School in Rhode Island to host this program.

== Library ==

The Little Compton Public Library was first founded 1879 and was formerly located within the Little Compton Town Hall. The Brownell Library was a separate library constructed in 1929 and was designed by Charles Loring in the Georgian Revival style. The Little Compton Public Library moved out of the Town Hall and consolidated with the Brownell library in 1963.

The Brownell Library currently serves as Little Compton&#x27;s only public library. In addition to book borrowing, the library offers programs, events, information resources, and other materials for library members.

==Rhode Island Red==
The Rhode Island Red is a native breed of poultry first bred by William Tripp in Adamsville. According to The Livestock Conservancy, &quot;The Rhode Island Red is not only America&#x27;s best known breed, but is perhaps the world&#x27;s best known fowl. It is the most successful dual purpose bird [raised for both eggs and meat], and remains an excellent farm chicken [or non-industrial breed].&quot; In 1925, the Rhode Island Red Club of America donated funds for a monument to the Rhode Island Red in Adamsville, at the intersection of Main Street and Westport River Road. Another plaque honoring the Rhode Island Red was erected by the state on the breed&#x27;s 100th anniversary in 1954, south of Adamsville on the wall of what was William Tripp&#x27;s farm. The two memorials reflect a dispute between poultry fanciers and farmers over who should have received credit for the breed&#x27;s success.

== Transportation ==
Little Compton is one of four towns in Rhode Island that is not served by RIPTA bus service. Route 77 runs 14 miles (23 km) from Rhode Island Road in southern Little Compton to Route 24 in Tiverton. Route 81 runs from Route 179 in southern Little Compton and continues as Massachusetts Route 81 near Fall River. 

Historically, railroads and streetcar lines were never constructed in Little Compton. Overland transportation in Little Compton has always been limited to roads.

<text>Portsmouth is a town in Newport County, Rhode Island, United States. The population was 17,871 at the 2020 U.S. census. Portsmouth is the second-oldest municipality in Rhode Island, after Providence; it was one of the four colonies which merged to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, the others being Providence, Newport, and Warwick.

==Geography==

Most of its land area lies on Aquidneck Island, which it shares with Middletown and Newport. In addition, Portsmouth encompasses some smaller islands, including Prudence Island, Patience Island, Hope Island and Hog Island. Part of the census-designated place of Melville lies within the town boundaries.

==History==

Portsmouth was settled in 1638 by a group of religious dissenters from Massachusetts Bay Colony, including Dr. John Clarke, William Coddington, and Anne Hutchinson. It is named after Portsmouth, Hampshire, England. Roger Williams convinced the settlers that they should go there instead of settling in the Province of New Jersey, where they had first planned on going.

It was founded by the signers of the Portsmouth Compact. Its original name was Pocasset and it was officially named Portsmouth on May 12, 1639. It became part of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (see Aquidneck Island) and eventually part of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.

==Schools==

==Commerce==
Portsmouth is home to the Portsmouth Business Park, as well as a few small plazas with a variety of businesses. Portsmouth is also home to the Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense division. Adjacent to Raytheon is the Newport Car Museum which opened in 2017 and receives 50,000 visitors a year.

==Sports==
Portsmouth is the headquarters of US Sailing, the national governing body of sailing in the U.S. It is also home to the Newport International Polo Series held at Glen Farm.

==Music==
On September 21, 2017, plaques were unveiled by Roger Williams University, along with Al Gomes and Connie Watrous of Big Noise, at the Baypoint Inn &amp; Conference Center honoring music icons The Beach Boys. The plaques were to commemorate the band&#x27;s concert on September 22, 1971 in Portsmouth. The concert was the first-ever appearance of South African Ricky Fataar as an official member of the band and Filipino Billy Hinsche as a touring member, essentially changing The Beach Boys&#x27; live and recording act&#x27;s line-up into a multi-cultural group. Diversity is a credo of Roger Williams University, which is why they chose to celebrate this moment in the band&#x27;s history.

Jimmy Buffett performed at the Sunset Cove restaurant on July 2, 2023, which was his final public performance before his death on September 1 of that year.

<text>Burrillville () is a town in Providence County, Rhode Island, United States. The population was 16,158 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Burrillville was probably first settled sometime around 1662, when the first Europeans began to settle the Nipmuc lands. The Town was originally a part of Glocester, Rhode Island. John Smith and members of the Saulsbury family were among the earliest settlers. Samuel Willard treated many smallpox victims in South Uxbridge and Glocester (Burrillville), and he had the scars to prove it. In 1806, The Town of Burrillville became a separate town and consisted of of land in the northwestern corner of Rhode Island, bordering Connecticut and Massachusetts. Later boundary disputes with Massachusetts and Glocester reduced this land area by the mid-19th century. Joktan Putnam was the first town moderator. The Nipmuc word for snake was rendered &quot;askug&quot; by Roger Williams in his &quot;A Key Into the Language of America,&quot; and &quot;askoog&quot; by the Reverend John Eliot in his Algonquian translation of the Bible. Burrillville&#x27;s principal village, Pascoag, named after the stream upon which it is located, probably derives from this Algonquian root. Gradually in the early-to-mid-19th century, the various mills and villages took shape such as Harris mills, and the village of Harrisville, Mapleville mills, Oakland mills etc. Buck Hill was known for a colorful band of counterfeiters. The town is today part of the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor, New England&#x27;s, historic National Park area. Burrillville was home to many historic mills, many of which have either been burned, demolished, abandoned or renovated. The Stillwater Mill Complex in Harrisville is home to the Clocktower apartments, which used to be the old Tinkham textile mills (factual content requested). The site is also home to the recently built Jesse Smith Library.

It was incorporated as an independent municipality on November 17, 1806, when the Rhode Island General Assembly authorized the residents of then North Glocester to elect its own officers. The town was named for 19th century United States senator James Burrill, Jr. who was then the Rhode Island Attorney General.

Until 1846, the Sherman Farm was owned by the family. It totaled over and was once the largest fruit and dairy farm in the state. The farmhouse had 32 rooms.

<text>Central Falls is a city in Providence County, Rhode Island, United States. The population was 22,583 at the 2020 census. With an area of only , it is the smallest and most densely populated city in the smallest state, and the 23rd most densely populated incorporated place in the United States. It is also one of only four incorporated places in New England that have a higher population density than the city of Boston (ranking second, behind the Massachusetts city of Somerville, an inner suburb of Boston). The city takes its name from a waterfall on the Blackstone River.

Central Falls went into receivership in May 2010, then filed for bankruptcy on August 1, 2011. After cutting jobs and services, it came out of bankruptcy in September 2012.

== History ==

Before Europeans arrived, the area was home to Nipmuc, Wampanoag and Narragansett peoples.

Central Falls has historic significance as the site of a major battle during King Philip&#x27;s War. It was here, on March 26, 1676, that Narragansett Indians ambushed Captain Michael Pierce and his Plymouth Colony troops who (with 20 Christian Wampanoag Indians) were pursuing them. Nearly all those ambushed were killed, including nine taken prisoner and later tortured to death at nearby Cumberland. A stone memorial marks the mass grave at the site known as &quot;Nine Men&#x27;s Misery&quot;.

In the 18th century, Captain Stephen Jenks built a trip hammer and blacksmith shop along the Blackstone River, forming the nucleus of what eventually became Central Falls. Other manufacturers, including a chocolate maker, set up shop in the building, and the new village became known as Chocolateville.

In 1824, Jenks suggested the name Central Falls, thus giving the village its permanent name. Central Falls was incorporated as a town in 1730.

Originally, Central Falls was one of the many villages within the town of Smithfield, but in 1871, having experienced a growth spurt, it split into three smaller towns: Smithfield, North Smithfield and Lincoln. Central Falls then became part of the town of Lincoln. Lincoln experienced its own growth spurt, so in 1895 Lincoln split into two towns, giving rise to the city of Central Falls.

While Quakers made up the majority of the first European settlers in the area, they were soon followed by a diverse mix of immigrants from Ireland, Scotland and French Canada. By the 20th century, Central Falls had experienced its own population explosion and for a while was the nation&#x27;s most densely populated city.

In 1922, Central Falls&#x27; textile mills were temporarily shut down by the New England Textile Strike over an attempted wage cut and hours increase.

In recent decades, a large number of Hispanic immigrants have resided in Central Falls. Central Falls has historically been an extremely diverse city, so much so that when the city celebrated its 100th anniversary with a parade in 1995, more than 100 countries were represented.

==Geography==

Central Falls is located at (41.889863, −71.392606).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and (6.20%) is water. It is drained by the Blackstone River.

==Education==
Residents are served by the Central Falls School District. This school district is funded and appointed by the State of Rhode Island Department of Education.

In February 2010, the entire faculty and administrative staff of Central Falls High School was fired after the teachers&#x27; union refused to accept one of the &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; options for restructuring failing schools. In accordance with NCLB legislation, schools deemed failing have four options to follow for restructuring. The superintendent chose the &quot;turnaround model&quot;, which requires a district to fire the entire staff (teachers and administrators). They may rehire up to 50% of the teachers for the beginning of the next school year. The school has a graduation rate of around 50%, and 7% of 11th-graders were proficient in mathematics in 2009. This school had been identified as one of the worst in the state. The teachers&#x27; union sued the school district, challenging the requirement that teachers reapply for their jobs. The Obama administration sided with the school board. In May 2010, the teachers were rehired when they agreed to work the extra time required.

As of the 2000 U.S. census, 5.9% of Central Falls residents 25 and older have a bachelor&#x27;s or advanced college degree.

There has been at least one Catholic school in Central Falls since 1895. By 1908, there were three: St. Matthew&#x27;s, Holy Trinity, and Notre Dame. In 1995, these three schools combined to create St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Academy, which is in the building originally serving St. Matthew&#x27;s. St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Academy is the only non-public school in Central Falls.

==Government==
In the Rhode Island Senate, Central Falls is in the 16th District, represented by Democrat Jonathan Acosta. At the federal level, Central Falls is a part of Rhode Island&#x27;s 1st congressional district, represented by Democrat Gabe Amo.

The city has a mayor-council government led by Mayor Maria Rivera. The city council consists of five wards and is represented by Jonathan Acosta, Robert Ferri, Hugo Figueroa, Franklin Solano, and Jessica Vega.

The Pawtucket Water Supply Board owns and operates the water system.

===Issues===
On April 25, 2010, the &quot;Providence Journal Bulletin&quot; ran an article detailing rampant fraud and corruption by Mayor Charles D. Moreau, outlining no-bid contracts and kickbacks from a high school friend, Michael G. Bouthillette, who was granted almost $2 million in overpriced property boarding fees. The article further states that Bouthillette gave him a $6,875 furnace for his home for only $6,000, which Moreau said he paid in cash. Bouthillette was a donor to Moreau&#x27;s multiple reelection campaigns. These allegations and others are being investigated by the Rhode Island State Police.

Central Falls&#x27;s government&#x27;s financial straits worsened in the 2000s as the state cut money to cities and towns, and pensions and pensioner health insurance for city employees accumulated to the extent that the city government declared insolvency in May 2010 and went into receivership. On August 1, 2011, Central Falls filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 9, Title 11 of the United States Code. It made the filing as it grappled with an $80 million unfunded pension and retiree health benefit liability that was over five times its annual budget of $17 million.

===Presidential Election Voting===
Like most other majority-minority urban municipalities, Central Falls is overwhelmingly Democratic in presidential elections. No Republican has come remotely close to winning the city in over three decades, during which time voters have consistently backed Democratic nominees with lopsided majorities. In 2020, however, Donald Trump won a massive increase in the vote, mirroring his performance in other majority-Hispanic areas. Despite this, Joe Biden still won by an overwhelming percentage.

<text>Cranston, formerly known as Pawtuxet, is a city in Providence County, Rhode Island, United States. The official population of the city in the 2020 United States Census was 82,934, making it the second-largest city in the state. The center of population of Rhode Island is located in Cranston. Cranston is a part of the Providence metropolitan area.

Cranston ranked 36th on the list of &quot;America&#x27;s 50 Best Cities to Live&quot; in a 2014 survey done by 247wallst.com.

The Town of Cranston was created in 1754 from a portion of Providence north of the Pawtuxet River. After losing much of its territory to neighboring towns and the city of Providence, Cranston itself became a city on March 10, 1910.

==History==
Much of the land was purchased by Roger Williams from the Narragansett Indians in 1638 as part of the Pawtuxet Purchase, and the first settler in the area was William Arnold, who was followed shortly by William Harris, William Carpenter, and Zachariah Rhodes. Stephen Arnold, a brother-in-law of Rhodes and William Arnold, built a gristmill on the Pawtuxet falls and laid out the Arnold Road (modern-day Broad Street) connecting it to the Pequot Trail leading to Connecticut. Arnold&#x27;s son Benedict Arnold became the first Governor of Rhode Island under the charter of 1663. Residents were unable to agree upon a name for a new town for decades, and the Town of Cranston was eventually created by the General Assembly in 1754 from a portion of Providence north of the Pawtuxet River. Historians debate whether the town was named after Governor Samuel Cranston, the longest-serving Rhode Island governor, or his grandson Thomas Cranston, who was serving as Speaker of the Rhode Island House of Representatives at the time that the town was created. In the early 1770s, town meetings were held at the taverns of Caleb Arnold and Nehemiah Knight, where residents voted in favor of a resolution opposing the British Parliament&#x27;s Coercive Acts; the town heavily supported the Patriot cause during the Revolutionary War. The town lost much of its territory to neighboring towns and the city of Providence over the nineteenth century, and Cranston became a city on March 10, 1910.

Many Italian Americans in Cranston are descended from immigrants of Itri, Italy who settled mainly in the Knightsville section of Cranston during the early 1900s. Cranston is known for the St. Mary&#x27;s Feast, inspired by the Feast of the Madonna della Civita celebrated in Itri. Since 1905, the St. Mary&#x27;s Feast has been a week-long festival celebrated in July in Cranston with vendors, a carnival, fireworks, and a religious procession from St. Mary&#x27;s Church on Sunday. In 2000, Cranston and Itri became sister cities.

For many years, Cranston was the third-largest city in Rhode Island, after Providence and Warwick, both of which it borders, but in 2017, it surpassed Warwick to take second place. Though Cranston&#x27;s overall population density was already much greater than the geographically larger Warwick, a major factor contributing to its growth has been a large and semirural section west of Interstate 295, which has seen a high volume of housing development in recent years; Warwick has significantly less open land available for development.

===Flood of 2010===
The Pawtuxet River overflowed in March 2010 after an overwhelming amount of rain. This caused many major sites to be shut down and repaired, such as the Warwick Mall, Contour Dental Laboratories, and the CLCF Building.

==Geography==

The city occupies roughly three percent of Rhode Island&#x27;s total land mass.

There were 34,182 housing units at an average density of 1,205.9 per square mile (465.6/km). The racial makeup was 68.14% (56,514) white or European American (65.66% non-Hispanic white), 5.65% (4,683) black or African-American, 0.58% (485) Native American or Alaska Native, 6.99% (5,799) Asian, 0.05% (45) Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian, 9.99% (8,282) from other races, and 8.59% (7,126) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race was 18.17% (15,067) of the population.

Of the 32,676 households, 27.9% had children under the age of 18; 43.7% were married couples living together; 31.1% had a female householder with no spouse or partner present. 30.0% of households consisted of individuals and 13.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.5 and the average family size was 3.2. The percent of those with a bachelor’s degree or higher was estimated to be 25.0% of the population.

19.0% of the population was under the age of 18, 8.6% from 18 to 24, 26.9% from 25 to 44, 27.3% from 45 to 64, and 18.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41.2 years. For every 100 females, the population had 104.9 males. For every 100 females ages 18 and older, there were 106.4 males.

The 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey estimates show that the median household income was $74,425 (with a margin of error of +/- $3,217) and the median family income was $89,180 (+/- $3,837). Males had a median income of $51,447 (+/- $2,606) versus $35,032 (+/- $2,123) for females. The median income for those above 16 years old was $42,882 (+/- $1,971). Approximately, 4.1% of families and 7.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.2% of those under the age of 18 and 8.8% of those ages 65 or over.

The most common Hispanic background in Cranston is Dominican American and Guatemalan American, reflective of Rhode Island&#x27;s Latino population as a whole. Also, a relatively large Cambodian American population is centered around Park and Pontiac Avenues in the center of the city. Italian Americans are still the predominant ethnicity throughout Cranston, numbered at 38% of the population. This gives Cranston one of the largest Italian-American communities in the United States, similar to neighboring Johnston and North Providence, Rhode Island.

The first auto race track in the country, Narragansett Park, located off Park Avenue, opened at present-day Stadium Ball Field in 1867 as a trotting track.

The Budlong Pool, located at 198 Aqueduct Road, off Reservoir Avenue (part of RI 2), is the city&#x27;s only public pool. Budlong, which is much larger than an Olympic-sized swimming pool, was built in the 1930s as a Works Progress Administration project. The pool was closed in 2019 after an architect&#x27;s report stated that the pool was &quot;close to the end of its serviceable life” and would cost $2 million to repair. The pool has since become a subject of political debate in the city. Mayor Ken Hopkins proposed in 2023 to completely replace the aging structure with a new $3.5-million redesign which, at 7,000 square feet, would be one-third the current size. 2,000 Cranston residents signed a petition opposing the project.

Sprague Mansion, an 18th-century homestead, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Thomas Fenner House, built around 1677, is one of the oldest houses in Rhode Island.

<text>Cumberland is the northeasternmost town in Providence County, Rhode Island, United States, first settled in 1635 and incorporated in 1746. The population was 36,405 at the 2020 census, making it the seventh-largest municipality and the largest town in the state.

== History ==

Cumberland was originally settled as part of Wrentham, Massachusetts, which was purchased from the local Indigenous Americans by the Plymouth Colony. It was later transferred to Rhode Island as part of a long-running boundary dispute. The town was named in honor of Prince William, Duke of Cumberland.

William Blackstone (also spelled William Blaxton in colonial times) was the first European to settle and live in Cumberland. (He was also the first European to have settled in Boston, but left when he and the newly arrived Puritans disagreed about religion.) He preached his brand of tolerant Christianity under an oak tree that became an inspiration to Christians worldwide. He lived on a farm in the Lonsdale area of Cumberland, where he cultivated the first variety of American apples, the Yellow Sweeting. The site of his home is now occupied by the Ann &amp; Hope mill.

The popular tourist destination &quot;Nine Men&#x27;s Misery&quot; is a tomb found on the grounds of a former Trappist monastery (Abbey of Our Lady of the Valley), part of which was destroyed in a fire in 1950. The Trappists sold the monastery and grounds to the town and part of the building was converted into the Edward J. Hayden Library, aka Cumberland Public Library in 1976. This combined three smaller libraries into one.

Cumberland was the site of iron works that made cannons and cannonballs for the French and Indian War and the American Revolution. Additionally, Cumberland (along with the neighboring towns of Central Falls, RI, Lincoln, RI, and Attleboro, Massachusetts) was the home of the Valley Falls Company, which is the original antecedent of Berkshire Hathaway, now one of the world&#x27;s largest and most successful companies.

A machine shop in Cumberland made the first power looms for woolens in America. These were reportedly used at the Capron Mill in Uxbridge, around 1820, that burned in a fire in 2007.

Cumberland is home to the headquarters and original location of the Ann &amp; Hope chain of discount stores which claims to be the first chain of discount department stores in America and was founded in 1955.

Cumberland is in the lower Blackstone Valley of Rhode Island and in the John H. Chafee, Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor, New England&#x27;s historic National Park area.

Aaron Fricke was denied a request to bring a same-sex date to a school prom at Cumberland High School 1980. In an early legal victory for LGBT rights, a federal court held that such a denial violated the student&#x27;s free speech rights, in &quot;Fricke v. Lynch&quot;.

In the summers of 2011 and 2014, the Cumberland American Little League baseball team, led by coach David Belisle (both times), won the New England Regional Little League Baseball Championship and went on to play in the Little League World Series.

==Geography==

Cumberland is the easternmost town along the state&#x27;s northern border with Massachusetts, making it the state&#x27;s de facto northeasternmost town. Cumberland borders the Rhode Island cities of Woonsocket to the northwest and Central Falls, to the south and the town of Lincoln to the west as well as the Massachusetts towns of Wrentham to the north, Plainville and North Attleborough to the east and city of Attleboro to the southeast.

The Rhode Island state rock Cumberlandite is a rare iron-rich mineral unique to the region. The only large deposit of the mineral in the world is found off Elder Ballou Meeting House Road in northern Cumberland. Though the ore was used to make cannons during the colonial era, the resulting casts were of poor quality and prone to cracking. A major geologic feature of the area is Diamond Hill, a massive outcropping of white quartz. The hill once was host to two small ski areas and is now a town park.

Cumberland is home to a public charter school, the first Rhode Island Mayoral Academy, Blackstone Valley Prep (originally Democracy Prep Blackstone Valley). The school opened in the fall of 2009 with Kindergarten.

The Blackstone Valley Prep High School, a $10 million mayoral charter school, opened in 2017 on the site of a former lumber center in Valley Falls.

The one non-public school in Cumberland, Mercymount Country Day School, is run by the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas, a Roman Catholic order which has its New England regional headquarters in Cumberland.

==Culture and traditions==

Cumberland is home to the Arnold Mills Fourth of July Parade and 4 Mile Road Race, which is held each year to celebrate (Fourth of July). The first recorded Arnold Mills Parade was held on July 4, 1927. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the road race was held &quot;virtually&quot; for the first time.

Cumberland Farms, a large convenience store chain, takes its name from the original dairy farm business in Cumberland, Rhode Island.

A popular event, Cumberlandfest, is held each year on the second weekend of August at Diamond Hill Park on Diamond Hill Road. This event features a carnival, with rides and venues, as well as live entertainment and a small fireworks show. Proceeds go to the town&#x27;s athletic programs.

The Blackstone River Theatre at 549 Broad Street hosts a wide variety of cultural events mostly in the form of intimate concerts encompassing the prevailing traditional cultures of the people who settled the Blackstone Valley. The Blackstone River Theatre sponsors the annual Summer Solstice Festival at Diamond Hill State Park in Cumberland.

Historic Metcalf-Franklin Farm on Abbott Run Valley Road was the last working dairy farm in Cumberland. Open historic fields, exposed farmers walls and a traditional &quot;cow&quot; pond are open for exploration. The 1810s barn and 1850s house are in the process of historical preservation.

<text>Foster is a town in Providence County, Rhode Island, United States. The population was 4,469 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

Foster was originally settled in the 17th century by British colonists as a farming community. In the year 1662, William Vaughan, Zachariah Rhodes, and Robert Wescott, purchased from the Indians a large tract of land called West Quanaug, bordering on Providence. The &#x27;West Quanaug purchase&#x27; included nearly the whole southern half of the town of Foster. The first English settler was allegedly Ezekiel Hopkins. Many settlers from Newport were active in the town in the 18th century. Shortly before the incorporation of the town, Foster&#x27;s first church, a Calvinist Baptist congregation was founded. Shortly afterwards, Six Principle Baptist and Free Will Baptist congregations were founded.

Foster was incorporated with Scituate, Rhode Island in 1730, forming the western section of that township, and remained part of Scituate until 1781, when it was split off as a distinct and separate township. Foster derived its name from U.S. Senator Theodore Foster. Mr. Foster presented the town with a library. Some of the library&#x27;s original books and town records are still preserved. U.S. Senator Nelson Aldrich was born in Foster in 1841. Senator Aldrich was instrumental in starting the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.

In the 1920s the Ku Klux Klan was active in the area. The largest Klan rally north of the Mason–Dixon line was held in Foster on the Old Home Day grounds in 1924 with 8,000 in attendance and U.S. Senator J. Thomas Heflin of Alabama speaking. Foster remained a bastion of racial and religious bigotry for more than half a century.
