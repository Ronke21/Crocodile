<text>Sanford is a city in Lee County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 30,261 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Lee County. The geographic center of North Carolina is located northwest of the city, in Chatham County.

==History==

Sanford was named for C.O. Sanford, a railroad civil engineer instrumental in the building of the rail lines through the area that formed the foundation of what became the city of Sanford.

Sanford is located in Lee County, North Carolina, which was formed from parts of the surrounding three counties in 1907. On creation of the new county, Sanford and Jonesboro were the major towns in the area. Rather than decide which would be the county seat, the decision was to place the county&#x27;s new courthouse directly between the two towns. For decades, Lee County was the only county in the United States to have a courthouse with an RFD address. In 1947 Sanford had grown to such an extent that it eventually merged with Jonesboro. The town of Jonesboro became Jonesboro Heights, and the name of Sanford was kept for the town.

The general Sanford area played key roles in the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, specifically regarding sites like the House in the Horseshoe and Endor Iron Furnace. Over the following decades, the Sanford area became an important source of coal, brownstone, and brick. In particular brownstone and subsequent brick production made Sanford a key provider of these building materials for areas throughout the United States.

For seven seasons, 1941–42 and 1946–50, Sanford fielded a professional minor league baseball team. In 1941-42, the Sanford Spinners played in the Class D level Bi-State League. After the war, a new Spinners team was a member of the Class D level Tobacco State League from 1946 to 1950. Home games were played at Temple Park. Led by manager Zeb Harrington, the Spinners won the regular season pennant three times.

On April 16, 2011, a large tornado ripped through Sanford, demolishing a Lowe&#x27;s hardware store and a warehouse, and destroying multiple mobile homes and buildings before moving into Wake County.

On October 21, 2014, Sanford established a formal sister city relationship with Yixing, China. On October 5, 2019, Sanford established a formal sister city relationship with Atizapan de Zaragoza, Mexico.

The Buffalo Presbyterian Church and Cemeteries, Downtown Sanford Historic District, East Sanford Historic District, Euphronia Presbyterian Church, Farish-Lambeth House, Hawkins Avenue Historic District, Lee Avenue Historic District, Lee County Courthouse, Lee County Training School, John D. McIver Farm, Railroad House, Rosemount-McIver Park Historic District, Sanford High School, Former, Seaboard Milling Company, and Temple Theatre are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Kinston is a city in Lenoir County, North Carolina, United States, with a population of 19,900 as of the 2020 census. It has been the county seat of Lenoir County since its formation in 1791. Kinston is located in the coastal plains region of eastern North Carolina.

In 2009, Kinston won the All-America City Award. This marks the second time in 21 years the city has won the title.

== History ==
===Early history===

At the time of English settlement, the area was inhabited by the Neusiok people. Preceding the historic tribe, indigenous peoples of a variety of cultures had lived in the area for thousands of years. Before the English colonists established the city, they called the area &quot;Atkins Bank&quot;, referring to a bluff once owned by Robert Atkins just above the Neuse River. Atkins Bank was the site of farms, a tobacco warehouse, and a Church of England mission.

Kinston was created by an act of the North Carolina General Assembly in December 1762 as &quot;Kingston&quot;, in honor of King George III, who had just recently ascended to the throne. The bill to incorporate it was introduced by Richard Caswell, who made his home there and later served as the first governor of the state of North Carolina from 1776 to 1780. After victory in the American Revolution, the citizens renamed the city &quot;Kinston&quot; in 1784 to show the population&#x27;s disavowal of royalty. In 1833, Kinston briefly became &quot;Caswell&quot;, in honor of Governor Caswell, but the name Kinston was restored the following year.

Commissioners appointed to design the town began to accept &quot;subscriptions&quot; for numbered lots. To keep a lot, subscribers were required to build brick homes of specific dimensions within three years or lose their rights to the property. The town was laid out with border streets named East, North, and South, with the western border the Neuse River. The two principal roads within these borders were named for King George and Queen Charlotte. They remain King and Queen Street to this day. Other streets were named in honor of Governor Arthur Dobbs (later renamed Independence Street) and the commissioners.

In December 1791, an act was passed in the General Assembly to abolish Dobbs County and form Lenoir and Glasgow (now Greene) Counties. At that time, Kinston was designated the county seat for Lenoir County.

Kinston was incorporated as a town through an act of the legislature in January 1849, after which the population grew rapidly. In 1850, the population was estimated at 455 people, and just 10 years later, it had more than doubled to over 1000.

===Civil War===
During the onset of the Civil War, Camp Campbell and Camp Johnston were established near the city as training camps, and a bakery on Queen Street was converted to produce hardtack in large quantities. Also, a factory for the production of shoes for the military was located in Kinston. The Battle of Kinston took place in and around the city on December 14, 1862.

From February 5 to February 22, 1864, twenty two Union soldiers of the 2nd North Carolina Union Volunteer Infantry Regiment were executed by hanging in the city. These men had been captured in the Battle of New Bern by Confederate troops, and were found to have previously served in North Carolina Partisan Ranger units. General George Pickett ordered that they should be court martialed for desertion from the Confederate Army, and the subsequent hangings were carried out by the 54th Regiment, North Carolina Troops under the command of General Robert Hoke. Fifteen of these men were from Jones County and had all started their service in the 8th Battalion North Carolina Partisan Rangers.

The Battle of Wyse Fork, also known as the Battle of Southwest Creek (March 7–10, 1865), took place very near the city. At this later battle, the Confederate ram &quot;Neuse&quot; was scuttled to avoid capture by Union troops. Remnants of the ship have been salvaged, and were on display at Richard Caswell Park on West Vernon Avenue. A climate-controlled museum has been built on downtown Queen Street, and has moved the hulk there to prevent further deterioration of the original ship&#x27;s remains. A full-scale replica vessel (&quot;Ram Neuse II&quot;) has been constructed near the original&#x27;s resting place (known as the &quot;Cat&#x27;s Hole&quot;) beside the bank of the Neuse River on Heritage Street in Kinston. Union Army forces occupied the city following the battle. United States troops were assigned to the area through the Reconstruction era.

===Post-Reconstruction===

Despite the hardships of war and Reconstruction, the population of the city continued to grow. By 1870, the population had increased to 1,100 people and grew to more than 1,700 within a decade.

During the late 19th century, an expansion into new areas of industry occurred, most notably the production of horse-drawn carriages. Kinston also became a major tobacco- and cotton-trading center. By the start of the 20th century, more than 5 million pounds of tobacco were being sold annually in Kinston&#x27;s warehouses. Along with the growth in population and industry came a growth in property values. Some parcels increased in value more than five-fold within a 20-year period.

On April 6, 1916, Joseph Black was taken from the Lenoir County Jail and lynched by a mob of armed men. He was accused of assisting his son in an escape attempt.

===20th century===
New industries were founded, including lumber and cotton mills, as North Carolina businessmen invested in processing their own crops. Professional sports were introduced in the form of a minor league baseball team. Later growth came from a DuPont plant for the manufacture of polyester fibers, and manufacturing plants for pharmaceuticals. Growth finally slowed following the 1960s, with the shift in textile production overseas. Efforts to reinvigorate the economy through various means have had limited success.

Kinston was heavily impacted by flooding in 1996 and 1999. Hurricane Fran struck the North Carolina coast on September 5, 1996, and brought of rain to the area, causing the Neuse River to flood portions of the city. On September 16, 1999, Hurricane Floyd struck the area, bringing of rain. It caused what locals have called the &quot;Flood of the Century&quot;.

==Culture==

=== Arts and theater ===

One of Kinston&#x27;s most notable buildings is the Grainger Hill Performing Arts Center, formerly Grainger High School. Constructed in 1924 after a fire destroyed the previous Kinston High School building, the school was named after Jesse W. Grainger, a local truck farmer who owned the land that the school was built upon and donated money to fund one-half of the building&#x27;s $182,340 general contractor&#x27;s fee. After the decision in 1970 to make way for the newly constructed and integrated Kinston High School, it served as Kinston Jr. High School until 1987 (when ninth-grade students were moved to the campus of Kinston High School and eighth-grade students were relocated to the campus of Rochelle Middle School). After the school&#x27;s closure, the building was sold to a private developer, who renovated the school and turned it into a performing arts center. The property was most recently sold to the Landmark Development Group, which renovated the building into Grainger Elderly Housing, a 57-unit apartment complex for low-income elderly residents.

The Lenoir County Confederate Memorial, the Caswell family cemetery, and the Lenoir County Korean and Vietnam War Memorial are located nearby. There is also a Civil War Trails marker.

The Cultural Heritage Museum, built in 2000 on South Queen Street as a new economic development catalyst for Kinston and the surrounding areas of eastern North Carolina, was created to recognize the contributions of African Americans in numerous fields. It pays tribute to the more than 200,000 Black soldiers and 7,000 White officers of the United States Colored Troops who fought with the Union forces in the Civil War. It also honors Black military veterans from all wars, Carl Long and the Negro Baseball League players, local heroes, and Africa and Black history in general. The museum intends to generate jobs and promote economic expansion opportunities.
Kinston is home to several notable restaurants. The Chef &amp; the Farmer, recipient of a James Beard Award, started by Vivian Howard and Ben Knight, is located in downtown Kinston. The PBS series &quot;A Chef&#x27;s Life&quot; focuses on the restaurant, owners, and local farmers from whom it sources. Also a proponent of sustainable practices and local ingredients, Mother Earth Brewing was founded in Kinston in the summer of 2008.

Other local attractions include the Neuseway Nature Center and Planetarium, the Kinston Center for the Arts, the Global Transit Park (GTP), Grainger Stadium, the Caswell Center, and Lenoir Memorial Hospital.

Annual festivities in Kinston include the Sand in the Streets concert series held at Pearson Park, the Annual BBQ Festival on the Neuse River, and the Festival on the Neuse.

==Sports==

Kinston&#x27;s Grainger Stadium was home to the Down East Wood Ducks, a Class A Minor League Baseball team of the Carolina League from 2017 to 2024. It was previously home to the Kinston Indians minor league baseball team, as well as youth and college level baseball tournaments. The town first hosted professional baseball in 1908 and among the many alumni is Rick Ferrell, who was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, Manny Ramirez, and Lonnie Chisenhall.

The Kinston Drag Strip hosts a variety of motor-sports events throughout the year. Kinston also has three golf courses: Kinston Country Club, Falling Creek Country Club, and Bill Fay Park Par 3 Golf Course. Barnet Park is home to a disc golf course. The Galaxy of Sports recreational facility includes a bowling alley, skating rink, and health club.

In 2012, Woodmen of the World constructed the Woodmen of the World Community Center and Lions Water Adventure Park, a facility that offers a cardio and strength-training center, an Olympic-sized swimming pool, several corporate reception areas, and conference rooms, as well as a quarter-mile elevated track and several sporting courts. The center is now owned by the city of Kinston and is called the Kinston Community Center.

In 1956, Kinston was the site of a rare, perfect game of billiards, as Willie Mosconi sank 150 balls in a row in one inning against Jimmy Moore.

In 2018, ESPN called Kinston &quot;America&#x27;s Basketball Heaven&quot;. According to the ESPN article, one in 52.7 players on Kinston High School&#x27;s varsity team makes the NBA.

<text>Lincolnton is a city in Lincoln County, North Carolina, United States within the Charlotte metropolitan area. The population was 11,091 at the 2020 census, with an estimated population of 12,128, as of 2023. Lincolnton is northwest of Charlotte, on the South Fork of the Catawba River. The city is the county seat of Lincoln County.

==History==

In June 1780 during the American Revolutionary War, the future site of Lincolnton was the site of the Battle of Ramsour&#x27;s Mill, a small engagement in which local Loyalists were defeated by pro-independence forces. Some historians consider the battle significant because it disrupted Loyalist organizing in the region at a crucial time.

After the Revolution, the legislature organized a new county by splitting this area from old Tryon County (named in the colonial era for a royally appointed governor). The 1780 battle site was chosen for the seat of Lincoln County. The new city and the county were named for Major General Benjamin Lincoln, who served in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.

The Piedmont area was developed for industry, based on using the water power from the streams and rivers there. With the advantage of the South Fork of the Catawba, Lincolnton was the site of the first textile mill in North Carolina, constructed by Michael Schenck in 1813. It was the first cotton mill built south of the Potomac River. Cotton processing became a major industry in the area. St. Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church was founded in 1841.

During the American Civil War, Lincoln County had many residents who either joined or were conscripted to the Confederate Army. Among them was Major General Stephen Dodson Ramseur, who was mortally wounded at the Battle of Cedar Creek in Virginia in the final year of the war. His body was returned to Lincolnton for burial. Episcopal missionary bishop Henry C. Lay spent the final months of the Civil War in the town. Union forces occupied Lincoln County on Easter Monday, 1865, shortly before the close of the war.

As county seat and a center of the textile industry, city residents prospered on the returns from cotton cultivation. The city has numerous properties, including churches, which have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since the late 20th century. It has three recognized historic districts: Lincolnton Commercial Historic District, South Aspen Street Historic District, and West Main Street Historic District. These were centers of the earliest businesses and retail activities. There was much activity around the Lincoln County Courthouse on court days, when farmers typically came to town to trade and sell their goods.

Residences, churches and other notable buildings marked the development of the city; they include the Caldwell-Cobb-Love House, Emanuel United Church of Christ, Emmanuel Lutheran Church, Eureka Manufacturing Company Cotton Mill, First Baptist Church, First Presbyterian Church, First United Methodist Church, Methodist Church Cemetery, Lincolnton Recreation Department Youth Center, Loretz House, Old White Church Cemetery, Pleasant Retreat Academy, Shadow Lawn, St. Luke&#x27;s Church and Cemetery, and Woodside.

In 1986, Lincolnton expanded by annexing the town of Boger City.

<text>Franklin is a town in and the county seat of Macon County, North Carolina, United States. It is situated within the Nantahala National Forest. The population was reported to be 4,175 in the 2020 census, an increase from the total of 3,845 tabulated in 2010.

The town developed around a 1,000-year-old platform mound, the center of the historic Cherokee town of Nikwasi.

Franklin is a popular destination for hikers and outdoor enthusiasts, specifically in relation to the Nantahala National Forest, the Great Smoky Mountains, and the Appalachian Trail. The town and the surrounding area is rich in gems and minerals, and is known locally as the &quot;Gem Capital of The World.&quot;

==History==
===Cherokee influence===
Prior to the arrival of European settlers, the area was home to tribes within the Cherokee Nation. The Cherokee called this area Nikwasi, or &quot;center of activity&quot;. Nikwasi was an ancient and important Cherokee town, centered around an ancient platform mound believed to be at least 1000-years-old. The Cherokee built their Council House on top of the mound. In the 21st century, the remains of Nikwasi Mound are still visible in downtown Franklin. It was privately owned until Franklin purchased the site in 1946 and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. In 1819, the Cherokee were forcibly relocated to the Qualla Boundary, which today is the home the federally recognized tribe of the Eastern Band of Cherokee.

===European settlement===
The city was named by European-American settlers for Jesse Franklin, one of two state commissioners who surveyed and organized the town in 1820 as the county seat, for what would become Macon County in 1828. Jesse Franklin was later elected by the state legislature as the United States Senator from North Carolina (popular election of senators did not become custom until the 20th century). He was later elected and served North Carolina as its 20th governor. The city of Franklin was not formally incorporated until 1855.

In August 1923, Franklin&#x27;s first hospital opened. Three years later the first permanent hospital in North Carolina west of Asheville was constructed downtown and named Angel Brothers Hospital. It was renamed Angel Hospital in 1940 and expanded in 1957, 1977, and 1991. A new $68 million Angel Medical Center was built and opened in 2022 on the east side of town.

In 1946, the people of Franklin raised money to buy the site of Nikwasi Mound and vowed to preserve it. Schoolchildren were among those who donated money to buy it from one of the many private owners who had held it since the Cherokee were forced from their historic town. In 2015, Franklin transferred title to the mound to the Nikwasi Initiative, a partnership among the Town of Franklin, Macon County, the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians and Mainspring Conservation Trust. The Initiative plans to develop the site as an historical and cultural site, including a museum in a building adjacent to the mound. 

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (0.78%) is water.

Among the native stones found are ruby, sapphire, and garnets. The Franklin Gem and Mineral Museum is free to the public and is noted for its exhibits.

===Waterfalls===
====Cullasaja Falls====
Cullasaja Falls is a waterfall in Southwestern North Carolina. The waterfall is located on the Cullasaja River in the Nantahala National Forest and is part of the Mountain Waters Scenic Byway. &quot;Cullasaja&quot; comes from a Cherokee word meaning &quot;honey locust place.&quot; The falls is the last major waterfall on the Cullasaja river. The falls is a long cascade over the course of .

The height of the falls is given as 200 ft (61 m) in Kevin Adams&#x27; book, &quot;North Carolina Waterfalls&quot; and 250 ft (77.1 m) by NCWaterfalls.com. However, Google Earth gives a height (based on the elevation of the water at the top of the falls and the elevation of the plunge pool at the bottom of the falls) of 137 ft (42 m). The falls may be glimpsed by people driving along Highway 64, but it is difficult to see more fully from the road. The falls are located beside of a series of blind curves on with sheer rock cliffs above and below the road. A small pull-off is located near the falls, but walking on the road puts visitors in danger of being hit by a passing vehicle.

====Dry Falls====
Dry Falls, also known as Upper Cullasaja Falls, is a 65-foot (20.1 m) waterfall located in the Nantahala National Forest, northwest of Highlands, North Carolina. Dry Falls flows on the Cullasaja River through the Nantahala National Forest. It is part of a series of waterfalls on a stretch of the river that eventually ends with Cullasaja Falls. Dry Falls flows over an overhanging bluff that allows visitors to walk up under the falls and remain relatively dry when the waterflow is low, hence its name. Visitors will get wet if the waterflow is high. The falls has been called Dry Falls for a long time, but has also gone by a few other names, including High Falls, Pitcher Falls, and Cullasaja Falls. Dry Falls is located on the side of U.S. Highway 64 southeast of Franklin, North Carolina. There is a parking area on the side of the road, where visitors can park before walking the short path with stairs to the falls. The United States Forest Service has made improvements to the parking area and has reopened the public area.

====Bridal Veil Falls====
Bridal Veil Falls is a 45-foot (20.1 m) waterfall located in the Nantahala National Forest, southeast of Franklin. With a short curve of roadway that passes behind the falls, this is the only waterfall in the state where one can drive a vehicle under the water. Bridal Veil Falls flows on a tributary of the Cullasaja River through the Nantahala National Forest. The falls flows over an overhanging bluff. Visitors can walk behind the falls and remain dry when the waterflow is low. During periods of drought, the stream may nearly dry up, though visitors will get wet if the waterflow is moderate or high.

Bridal Veil Falls is located on the side of U.S. Highway 64 southeast of Franklin. Highway 64 originally used the curve of roadway behind the falls exclusively, so that all traffic went behind them. But this caused problems with icing of the roadway during freezing weather, and Hwy. 64 has been re-routed around the front of the falls since. A parking area is located on the side of the road, so that visitors can park and view the falls from there.

In 2003, a massive boulder slid off the left side of the falls, blocking that side of the drive-under completely. However, in July 2007, that boulder was removed by a local developer.

====Quarry Falls====
Quarry Falls is a small waterfall (or perhaps large rapid in high water) located beside US Hwy. 64 southeast of Franklin, North Carolina. Known to locals as &quot;Sliding Rock&quot;, it is best known for the large, deep pool at the bottom. It is a popular place for swimming during warm weather.

=== Scottish Tartans Museum ===
Franklin has been home to the Scottish Tartans Museum since 1994. It shows materials common to some of the Scots-Irish immigrants who settled in this area in the late eighteenth century and later.

== Education ==

The local public school system is run by Macon County Schools. Franklin High School serves grades 9–12. Macon Early College is a high school that offers college classes. East Franklin Elementary school serves younger grades.

==Media==
&quot;The Franklin Press&quot; has been published weekly in Franklin since 1888. It is the oldest standing business in Macon County. The &quot;Press&quot; was preceded by four other Macon County newspapers: &quot;The Franklin Observer&quot; and &quot;The Western Carolinian&quot; (both of which began in 1860), the &quot;Macon Advance&quot; (started in 1877), and &quot;The Western Reporter&quot; (1880-1881). None of them lasted more than a few years.

==Library==

<text>Hot Springs is a town in Madison County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 520 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Asheville metropolitan statistical area. It is situated on the Appalachian Trail and French Broad River near the North Carolina-Tennessee border. Hot Springs is best known for its hiking trails, natural springs, and mountain town atmosphere. 

==History==
Hot Springs is located at the confluence of the French Broad River and Spring Creek. A natural thermal spring is located there, the only hot spring known in North Carolina and in much of the southeastern United States. Thus, this area has long been a destination for those looking for therapeutic relief from their ailments. Native Americans were the first to discover and use the 108°F (42°C) mineral waters, and European immigrants settled the area over 200 years ago. It is reported that people were visiting the springs by 1778 for the waters&#x27; reported healing properties.

It was believed Jasper Dagy was the first owner of Warm Springs, as it was then called, and he sold it to William Neilson in 1791. Neilson built an inn, and Philip Hoodenpile built an estate and a ferry across the French Broad, as well as the toll road Jewel Hill Road. In 1828, a major road was constructed through the town, the Buncombe Turnpike, making the area more accessible.

By 1831, James Patton of Asheville bought the springs and had erected 350 room Warm Springs Hotel with its 13 tall columns representing the Thirteen Colonies in 1837. The dining room of this large hotel could seat 600 people. The railroad reached the village in 1882. The hotel burned in 1884 after 46 years of operation. Another hotel, called the Mountain Park, was built in 1886. 

A higher temperature spring was found, prompting the changing of the town&#x27;s name from Warm Springs to Hot Springs in 1886. Sixteen marble pools were surrounded by landscaped lawns with croquet and tennis courts, and it was known as one of the most lavish resorts in the Southeast. By May 1917, the hotel and grounds were leased to the US Government to be used as an internment camp. Many German and Austro-Hungarian internees, noncombatant aliens, made local friends and stayed in the region after World War I. That hotel burned in 1920, and two more were built—neither as large and opulent, and both later burned as well.

Hot Springs and the historic district was devasted by flooding caused by Hurricane Helene on September 27th, 2024. 
==Geography==

The town is a tourist destination, with the springs as well as abundant outdoor recreation. The Appalachian Trail runs along downtown&#x27;s Bridge Street and climbs the mountains on either side of the river. Rafting and kayaking is popular on the French Broad River. There are numerous other hiking, mountain biking, backpacking, and sightseeing opportunities in the nearby Pisgah National Forest.

<text>Marshall is a town in Madison County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 872 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Madison County.

Marshall is part of the Asheville metropolitan area.

The townsite of Marshall is blocked on one side by the French Broad River and on all other sides by steep mountainous terrain. Madison County residents say Marshall is &quot;a block wide, a mile long, sky high and hell deep.&quot;

==History==
The Bank of French Broad, Capitola Manufacturing Company Cotton Yarn Mill, Madison County Courthouse, Marshall High School, Marshall Main Street Historic District, James H. White House, and Jeff White House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

During the Civil War, Marshall, as the seat of Confederate administration for Madison County, was the scene of conflict with the largely pro-Union rural population. On May 13, 1861, the election day for delegates to the state convention on secession from the Union, a man shot and killed the pro-secession county sheriff after a dispute in which the sheriff had shot the man&#x27;s son.

Later, Confederate authorities restricted the distribution of salt, which was needed to preserve meat in the winter. In January 1863, a group of men raided the salt warehouse in Marshall, then proceeded to ransack the home of Colonel Lawrence Allen of the 64th North Carolina Regiment (the columned house below the courthouse dome in the Main Street photo).

In retaliation, the 64th North Carolina Regiment summarily executed 13 men and boys in the Shelton Laurel massacre.

From the 1950s to the 1980s, Marshall was the seat of the Ponder machine, which controlled all the patronage jobs in Madison County.
The town was impacted by Hurricane Helene in 2024. The hurricane destroyed several buildings in Marshall, and damaged the town hall.

==History==
The town of Bear Grass, located in the southern part of Martin County, was named for the Bear Grass, a type of yucca (Yucca flaccida) that grows less than two feet in height and is found abundantly in the region. One of the first settlers to the area was John Swinson, who received a large tract of land from the Earl of Granville, the last Lord proprietor in 1761. Bear Grass Swamp was a part of this property and was mentioned in Swinson&#x27;s deed. Many of the early settlers were farmers whose principal crops of cotton and corn were sold in towns along the Tar and Roanoke Rivers. Sheep, cattle, and hogs were also raised in large numbers and farmers often supplemented their income with shingle making, woodcrafts, and the production of tar and turpentine from the area&#x27;s abundant forests.

Though the congregation of the Bear Grass Primitive Baptist Church organized in 1828, the Bear Grass community did not emerge until after the Civil War. A public school constructed of logs started by the late 1860s directly across the street from the existing school. Reuben H. Rogerson opened a general mercantile store in the 1880s, followed in the early 1900s by several additional general merchandise stores and a blacksmith shop. The community&#x27;s development was hindered by it not being located along a navigable stream or on either of the railroad lines traversing Martin County. A post office was established in 1885, although it was closed less than two years later.

Records are limited, complicated by the fact that Bear Grass businesses were listed in directories with Williamston addresses because that was the nearest post office. But by the turn of the century, the community consisted of several legal distilleries, cotton gins, sawmills, grist mills and blacksmith shops. Reuben H. Rogerson&#x27;s two story steam-powered sawmill and cotton gin was one of the area&#x27;s largest before being destroyed by fire in November 1908.

The first decade of the 20th century witnessed considerable growth in the community. After several meetings in early 1909, the town&#x27;s merchants drew up a charter and on February 16, 1909, the General Assembly granted a charter to the town of Bear Grass.

An unusual physical feature of the town is that, when incorporated, the boundary was a circle with a radius of 500 yards from a white oak &quot;near a well at the stores of Rogers Brothers and Cowing [sic] Brothers.&quot; These limits remain today, making Bear Grass one of the few towns in the state laid out in this manner.

Local artist Henry C. Cowen created two statues that enliven the Bear Grass School campus. The &quot;rampant bear&quot; statue standing in front of the school was sculpted in 1981. The statue of George Washington in front of the Yucca House (formerly the Bear Grass School teacherage) was commissioned by the Bear Grass Ruritan Club in honor of the country&#x27;s constitutional bicentennial in 1987. Cowen also produced several war memorial soldiers located on the corner of Green Street and Ayers Avenue.

Beginning in 2014, Bear Grass hosts the annual Chicken Mull Festival. Chicken mull is a local comfort food consisting of parboiled chicken, broth, crushed soda crackers, chopped boiled eggs and seasoning. The festival is held each year in the fall, and includes the sale of locally made goods, fundraisers for various local organizations, sale of chicken mull, and other festivities. Musical presentations by gospel, country and bluegrass bands are also included.

About 18.2% of families and 24.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 32.8% of those under age 18 and 43.4% of those age 65 or over.

==History==
The town was founded in 1804 on the highest point of the Roanoke River.

The most significant historical event of early Hamilton was the battle and fall of Fort Branch, when Union vessels and troops came upriver from Plymouth (see Plymouth, North Carolina History) in an attempt to reach Weldon to cut off supplies to General Robert E. Lee during the Civil War. The fort protected Weldon until the day after the General Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House, whereupon the railroad line over the Weldon bridge had no more military significance. Afterwards, the fort was abandoned and the cannons were dumped into the Roanoke River by departing Confederate troops, and were only recently discovered. In July 1972, a group of men from Alabama came and began pulling cannons from the river. The group was accused of violating North Carolina&#x27;s antiquities laws in an effort to keep the cannons in Martin County. The courts officially decided that the cannons belong to the state under the North Carolina Department of Archives and History. The department decided to permanently loan the artifact to Fort Branch.

The Historic Hamilton Commission, started in 1976, is in charge of 52 other historic sites in the county, including St. Martin&#x27;s Episcopal Church. The church was established as a missionary station of the Episcopalian church in 1868. It was founded primarily by members of the Boyle family, such as Francis Atherton Boyle and Mary A. Boyle. St. Martin&#x27;s was admitted to the Episcopal convention in 1873. Building began in 1879. All of the construction materials were from local suppliers, except the bell and stained glass, which were imported from Wales. The church was consecrated on May 17, 1882. The Rev. Dr. Watson preached the sermon; Bishop Lyman celebrated Holy Communion. The church is now inactive, but is still owned by the Episcopal Diocese of East Carolina. This means it is still a consecrated church.

Another important site in Hamilton is the Rosenwald School. A black school funded by Julius Rosenwald, president of Sears, Roebuck and Co.. During segregation, white schools had approximately five times the funding of the former. The Rosenwald Fund sought to provide support for these underprivileged schools. According to the Roanoke River Partners, The Rosenwald school will be remodeled and used as their headquarters. Hamilton is in the exact middle of the Roanoke River, making it a sensible location. Despite this, and years of taxpayer funding of the Roanoke River Partners, no concrete action has been taken to restore the building which is currently dilapidated.

Hamilton, once a thriving, beautiful Victorian port town with many of its homes listed in the National Historic Registry, had been in decline in recent years.

<doc id="128026" wikidata="Q1501493" url="?curid=128026" title="Kubb">
<text>Kubb (pronounced in Swedish and Gutnish) is a lawn game where the objective is to knock over wooden blocks () by throwing wooden batons () at them. Kubb can be described as a combination of bowling and horseshoes. Play takes place on a small rectangular playing field, known as a &quot;pitch&quot;. &quot;Kubbs&quot; are placed at both ends of the pitch, and the &quot;king&quot;, a larger wooden block, is placed in the middle of the pitch. Some rules vary from country to country and from region to region, but the ultimate objective of the game is to knock over the &quot;kubbs&quot; on the opposing side of the pitch, and then to knock over the &quot;king&quot;, before the opponent does. Games can last from five minutes to well over an hour. The game can be played on a variety of surfaces such as grass, sand, concrete, snow, or even ice.

== History ==

===Possible forebears===
The features of kubb most distinguishing it from other pin-toppling games (such as bowling and skittles) are that 1) teams &quot;own&quot; opposite sides of the playing field, and 2) toppled pins are &quot;recycled&quot; back into play and may be tossed to opposite sides. Endrei &amp; Zolnay briefly note an unnamed game, played in Poland &quot;as early as the sixteenth century&quot;, which seems to exhibit both features.

Though differing from kubb in detail, , as published in Leipzig in 1800, displays most of the fundamental features of kubb, including team sides, recycled pins, a kingpin, and even the requirement to throw from behind one&#x27;s own pins; though as in the Polish game, the main projectile is a ball rather than a baton.

The Karelian game kyykkä and the possibly Siberian game bunnock both feature team sides and (unlike the Polish game and kaisers) use versions of batons as projectiles rather than balls.

Though typologically related to kubb, no definite historical connection between these games and kubb has been shown.

=== Norway ===
Known as &quot;kilkasting&quot;, variations of kubb has been used as children&#x27;s play and for juvenile competitions. It is known and described from mid 19th century.

===Sweden===

Sören Wallin has identified the Swedish game (as described in a 1911 encyclopedia) as essentially the same as, and the forebear of, kubb. This game was known on the Swedish mainland at least as early as 1878, when it was described in &quot;Ungdomens Bok&quot;, a sort of &quot;Boys&#x27; Own Book&quot;.

Kägelkrig, the Polish game, and kaisers all seem to feature felled pins being thrown to the opponent side &quot;in order themselves to fell opponent pins&quot;, which is not a feature of contemporary kubb.

====Gotland====
Kubb was evidently unknown in Gotland in 1912, when a list of traditional Gotlandic games was drawn up, in conjunction with the Olympic Games (held in Stockholm that year). However, in 1931 a Gotlandic ethnologist, visiting the island of Fårö, just to the north of Gotland, recorded the earliest known use of the name &quot;kubb&quot; for this game, and it was played by residents of Gotland by at least the mid-20th century.

In the 1980s it became a local craze, leading to the first local commercial manufacturing efforts in the late 1980s. In 1995 a tournament was initiated in Rone, Gotland — the Kubb World Championship — somewhat ironically titled, as it was at this time still a thoroughly local affair. However, within only a few years, mainland and international teams were coming to Gotland to compete, and a major Swedish manufacturer was selling Kubb sets; in the 2000s Kubb spread to several European countries, as well as the USA and Canada. Large kubb tournaments now occur throughout Europe and the United States of America. Belgium alone held over 50 tournaments in 2012.

The Kubb World Championship takes place at the same time as &quot;Medieval Week&quot; in Visby (which has been &quot;the island&#x27;s main tourist magnet since the mid 1980s&quot;). Medieval Week also incorporated the playing of kubb, and this connection has likely motivated kubb&#x27;s being marketed, both in the US and in Europe, with such unfounded appellations as &quot;Viking Chess&quot; and &quot;Old Norse Viking outdoor game&quot;.

=== United Kingdom ===
UK Kubb, the national body for Kubb in the UK, was founded in 2006 by two enthusiasts, one of whom had learned the game when on holiday in Sweden. They organised a UK Kubb Championship which has been run annually since that time. The championship rules are adapted from those of the US National Championship rules.

== Game pieces ==

Twenty-one or twenty-three game pieces are used in kubb:
*Ten kubbs, rectangular wooden blocks 10–15 cm tall and 5–7 cm square on the end.
*One king, a larger wooden piece 25–30 cm tall and 7–9 cm square on the end, sometimes adorned with a crown design on the top.
*Six batons, 25–30 cm long and 2.5–4.4 cm in diameter.
*Four or six field marking pins, four to designate the corners of the pitch, and, if there are six, two to mark the centreline.

== Setup ==


According to the US Championship rules and World Championship rules, kubb is played on a rectangular pitch 5 metres by 8 metres. Corner stakes are placed so that a rectangle is formed. The center stakes are placed in the middle of the sidelines (long edges of the rectangle), which divides the pitch into two halves. No other markers are required to demarcate the field&#x27;s boundaries, although markings that do not interfere with game play are allowed (such as chalk lines).

The king is placed upright in the center of the pitch, and the kubbs are placed on the baselines (short edges of the rectangle), five kubbs on each side equidistant from each other.

Kubbs starting the game on the baseline are referred to as &quot;base kubbs&quot;. The baseline should run through the center of the kubbs. For young children, the 8-meter pitch length can be shortened.

== Rulesets ==

Two official tournament rulesets available for kubb are the World Championship rules and the U.S. National Championship rules.

=== U.S. National Championship ruleset overview ===

Kubb is played between two teams, which may or may not consist of only one person per team.
There are two phases for each team&#x27;s turn:
#Team A throws the six batons (called Kastpinne/Kastpinnar in Swedish) from their baseline, at their opponent&#x27;s lined-up kubbs (called baseline kubbs). Throws must be under-handed, and, if the batons spin, they must spin end over end at no more than 45 degrees from the vertical. Throwing batons overhand, sideways or spinning them side-to-side (like a helicopter) is not allowed.
#Kubbs that are successfully knocked down by Team A are then thrown by Team B onto Team A&#x27;s half of the pitch, and stood on end. These newly thrown kubbs are called &quot;field kubbs&quot;. The key objective is to keep them close to each other (as to be able to hit more than one with a single throw of the batons (Kastpinnar)). The player that tosses the kubbs is called the inkastare.

If a kubb is thrown out of play, &quot;i.e.&quot;, outside the boundary markers or not beyond the middle line (Note: after being raised, at least half of the kubb must be in the field of play to be considered in play), then one more attempt is given. If this also goes out, the kubb becomes a &quot;punishment kubb&quot; and can be placed anywhere in the target half by the opposing team as long as it is at least one baton length from a corner marker or the King.
If a thrown kubb knocks over an existing baseline or field kubb, then the field kubbs are raised at the location where they rest, and baseline kubbs are raised at their original location.

Play then changes hands, and Team B throws the batons at Team A&#x27;s kubbs, but must first knock down any standing field kubbs. If a baseline kubb is knocked down before all remaining field kubbs, the baseline kubb is returned to its upright position. (Field kubbs that right themselves due to the momentum of the impact are considered knocked down. Kubbs are considered knocked down if they end up tilting and relying on a game piece for support.) Again, all kubbs that are knocked down are thrown back over onto the opposite half of the field and then stood up.

If either team does not knock down all field kubbs before their turn is over, the kubb closest to the centerline now represents the opposite team&#x27;s baseline, and throwers may step up to that line to throw at their opponent&#x27;s kubbs. This rule applies only to throwing the batons at the opposing team&#x27;s field and baseline kubbs; fallen kubbs are thrown from the original baseline, as are attempts to knock over the king (see below).

Play continues in this fashion until a team is able to knock down all kubbs on the opposing team&#x27;s half of the field. If the former team still has batons left to throw, they now attempt to knock over the king. If a thrower successfully topples the king, their team has won the game.

If at any time during the game the king is knocked down by a baton or kubb while the opposing team still has kubbs in its half of the field, the throwing team immediately loses the game.

In tournaments, winners are typically determined by playing best out of three.

For informal play between players of widely differing abilities, such as an adult and a child, it is permissible to shorten the length of the pitch. Another option is for both players to play on the same team and keep switching sides during play.

== Tournaments ==


The Kubb World Championship is held annually on the island of Gotland, Sweden. The U.S. Championship is held annually in Eau Claire, WI.

Tournaments in the U.S. have exploded since 2007, especially in the Midwest. In 2016, the U.S. tournament list includes over 40 tournaments. The majority of tournaments are located in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

In 2013, the U.S. Midwest Championship was re-introduced. The annual tournament travels throughout the Midwest. (2013: Rockford, IL; 2014: Decorah, IA; 2015: Madison, WI; 2016: Madison, WI; 2017: Shakopee, MN; 2018: Canton, OH)

European tournaments are held in Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, the UK and Italy. Most countries have their own national championship tournament.

<doc id="128027" wikidata="Q847079" url="?curid=128027" title="Operant conditioning">
<text>Operant conditioning, also called instrumental conditioning, is a learning process in which voluntary behaviors are modified by association with the addition (or removal) of reward or aversive stimuli. The frequency or duration of the behavior may increase through reinforcement or decrease through punishment or extinction.

==Origins==
Operant conditioning originated with Edward Thorndike, whose law of effect theorised that behaviors arise as a result of consequences as satisfying or discomforting. In the 20th century, operant conditioning was studied by behavioral psychologists, who believed that much of mind and behaviour is explained through environmental conditioning. Reinforcements are environmental stimuli that increase behaviors, whereas punishments are stimuli that decrease behaviors. Both kinds of stimuli can be further categorised into positive and negative stimuli, which respectively involve the addition or removal of environmental stimuli.

Operant conditioning differs from classical conditioning in both mechanism and outcome. While classical conditioning pairs stimuli to produce involuntary, reflexive behaviors (like salivating at food), operant conditioning shapes voluntary behaviors through their consequences. Actions followed by rewards tend to be repeated, while those followed by negative outcomes diminish.

The study of animal learning in the 20th century was dominated by the analysis of these two sorts of learning, and they are still at the core of behavior analysis. They have also been applied to the study of social psychology, helping to clarify certain phenomena such as the false consensus effect.

==History==
===Thorndike&#x27;s law of effect===

Operant conditioning, sometimes called &quot;instrumental learning&quot;, was first extensively studied by Edward L. Thorndike (1874–1949), who observed the behavior of cats trying to escape from home-made puzzle boxes. A cat could escape from the box by a simple response such as pulling a cord or pushing a pole, but when first constrained, the cats took a long time to get out. With repeated trials ineffective responses occurred less frequently and successful responses occurred more frequently, so the cats escaped more and more quickly. Thorndike generalized this finding in his law of effect, which states that behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated. In short, some consequences &quot;strengthen&quot; behavior and some consequences &quot;weaken&quot; behavior. By plotting escape time against trial number Thorndike produced the first known animal learning curves through this procedure.

Humans appear to learn many simple behaviors through the sort of process studied by Thorndike, now called operant conditioning. That is, responses are retained when they lead to a successful outcome and discarded when they do not, or when they produce aversive effects. This usually happens without being planned by any &quot;teacher&quot;, but operant conditioning has been used by parents in teaching their children for thousands of years.

===B. F. Skinner===

B.F. Skinner (1904–1990) is referred to as the Father of operant conditioning, and his work is frequently cited in connection with this topic. His 1938 book &quot;The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis&quot;, initiated his lifelong study of operant conditioning and its application to human and animal behavior. Following the ideas of Ernst Mach, Skinner rejected Thorndike&#x27;s reference to unobservable mental states such as satisfaction, building his analysis on observable behavior and its equally observable consequences.

Skinner believed that classical conditioning was too simplistic to be used to describe something as complex as human behavior. Operant conditioning, in his opinion, better described human behavior as it examined causes and effects of intentional behavior.

To implement his empirical approach, Skinner invented the operant conditioning chamber, or &quot;Skinner Box&quot;, in which subjects such as pigeons and rats were isolated and could be exposed to carefully controlled stimuli. Unlike Thorndike&#x27;s puzzle box, this arrangement allowed the subject to make one or two simple, repeatable responses, and the rate of such responses became Skinner&#x27;s primary behavioral measure. Another invention, the cumulative recorder, produced a graphical record from which these response rates could be estimated. These records were the primary data that Skinner and his colleagues used to explore the effects on response rate of various reinforcement schedules. A reinforcement schedule may be defined as &quot;any procedure that delivers reinforcement to an organism according to some well-defined rule&quot;. The effects of schedules became, in turn, the basic findings from which Skinner developed his account of operant conditioning. He also drew on many less formal observations of human and animal behavior.

Many of Skinner&#x27;s writings are devoted to the application of operant conditioning to human behavior. In 1948 he published &quot;Walden Two&quot;, a fictional account of a peaceful, happy, productive community organized around his conditioning principles. In 1957, Skinner published &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot;, which extended the principles of operant conditioning to language, a form of human behavior that had previously been analyzed quite differently by linguists and others. Skinner defined new functional relationships such as &quot;mands&quot; and &quot;tacts&quot; to capture some essentials of language, but he introduced no new principles, treating verbal behavior like any other behavior controlled by its consequences, which included the reactions of the speaker&#x27;s audience.

==Concepts and procedures==

===Origins of operant behavior: operant variability===
Operant behavior is said to be &quot;emitted&quot;; that is, initially it is not elicited by any particular stimulus. Thus one may ask why it happens in the first place. The answer to this question is like Darwin&#x27;s answer to the question of the origin of a &quot;new&quot; bodily structure, namely, variation and selection. Similarly, the behavior of an individual varies from moment to moment, in such aspects as the specific motions involved, the amount of force applied, or the timing of the response. Variations that lead to reinforcement are strengthened, and if reinforcement is consistent, the behavior tends to remain stable. However, behavioral variability can itself be altered through the manipulation of certain variables.

===Modifying operant behavior: reinforcement and punishment===

Reinforcement and punishment are the core tools through which operant behavior is modified. These terms are defined by their effect on behavior. &quot;Positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; refer to whether a stimulus was added or removed, respectively. Similarly, &quot;reinforcement&quot; and &quot;punishment&quot; refer to the future frequency of the behavior. Reinforcement describes a consequence that makes a behavior occur more often in the future, whereas punishment is a consequence that makes a behavior occur less often. 

There are a total of four consequences:

# Positive reinforcement occurs when a behavior (response) results in a desired stimulus being added and increases the frequency of that behavior in the future. Example: if a rat in a Skinner box gets food when it presses a lever, its rate of pressing will go up. Pressing the lever was positively reinforced.
# Negative reinforcement (a.k.a. escape) occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by the removal of an aversive stimulus, thereby increasing the original behavior&#x27;s frequency. Example: A child is afraid of loud noises at a fireworks display. They put on a pair of headphones, and they can no longer hear the fireworks. The next time the child sees fireworks, they put on a pair of headphones. Putting on headphones was negatively reinforced.
# Positive punishment (also referred to as &quot;punishment by contingent stimulation&quot;) occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by an aversive stimulus which makes the behavior less likely to occur in the future. Example: A child touches a hot stove and burns his hand. The next time he sees a stove, he does not touch it. Touching the stove was positively punished.
# Negative punishment (penalty) (also called &quot;punishment by contingent withdrawal&quot;) occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by the removal of a stimulus, and the behavior is less likely to occur in the future. Example: When an employee puts their lunch in a communal refrigerator, it gets stolen before break time. The next time the employee brings a lunch to work, they do not put it in the refrigerator. Putting the lunch in the refrigerator was negatively punished.

* Extinction is a consequence strategy that occurs when a previously reinforced behavior is no longer reinforced with either positive or negative reinforcement. During extinction the behavior becomes less probable. Occasional reinforcement can lead to an even longer delay before behavior extinction due to the learning factor of repeated instances becoming necessary to get reinforcement, when compared with reinforcement being given at each opportunity before extinction. 

====Schedules of reinforcement====
Schedules of reinforcement are rules that control the delivery of reinforcement. The rules specify either the time that reinforcement is to be made available, or the number of responses to be made, or both. Many rules are possible, but the following are the most basic and commonly used

* Fixed interval schedule: Reinforcement occurs following the first response after a fixed time has elapsed after the previous reinforcement. This schedule yields a &quot;break-run&quot; pattern of response; that is, after training on this schedule, the organism typically pauses after reinforcement, and then begins to respond rapidly as the time for the next reinforcement approaches.
* Variable interval schedule: Reinforcement occurs following the first response after a variable time has elapsed from the previous reinforcement. This schedule typically yields a relatively steady rate of response that varies with the average time between reinforcements.
* Fixed ratio schedule: Reinforcement occurs after a fixed number of responses have been emitted since the previous reinforcement. An organism trained on this schedule typically pauses for a while after a reinforcement and then responds at a high rate. If the response requirement is low there may be no pause; if the response requirement is high the organism may quit responding altogether.
* Variable ratio schedule: Reinforcement occurs after a variable number of responses have been emitted since the previous reinforcement. This schedule typically yields a very high, persistent rate of response.
* Continuous reinforcement: Reinforcement occurs after each response. Organisms typically respond as rapidly as they can, given the time taken to obtain and consume reinforcement, until they are satiated.

====Factors that alter the effectiveness of reinforcement and punishment====
The effectiveness of reinforcement and punishment can be changed. 
# Satiation/Deprivation: The effectiveness of a positive or &quot;appetitive&quot; stimulus will be reduced if the individual has received enough of that stimulus to satisfy his/her appetite. The opposite effect will occur if the individual becomes deprived of that stimulus: the effectiveness of a consequence will then increase. A subject with a full stomach wouldn&#x27;t feel as motivated as a hungry one.
# Immediacy: An immediate consequence is more effective than a delayed one. If one gives a dog a treat for sitting within five seconds, the dog will learn faster than if the treat is given after thirty seconds.
# Contingency: To be most effective, reinforcement should occur consistently after responses and not at other times. Learning may be slower if reinforcement is intermittent, that is, following only some instances of the same response. Responses reinforced intermittently are usually slower to extinguish than are responses that have always been reinforced.
# Size: The size, or amount, of a stimulus often affects its potency as a reinforcer. Humans and animals engage in cost-benefit analysis. If a lever press brings ten food pellets, lever pressing may be learned more rapidly than if a press brings only one pellet. A pile of quarters from a slot machine may keep a gambler pulling the lever longer than a single quarter.

Most of these factors serve biological functions. For example, the process of satiation helps the organism maintain a stable internal environment (homeostasis). When an organism has been deprived of sugar, for example, the taste of sugar is an effective reinforcer. When the organism&#x27;s blood sugar reaches or exceeds an optimum level the taste of sugar becomes less effective or even aversive.

====Shaping====

Shaping is a conditioning method often used in animal training and in teaching nonverbal humans. It depends on operant variability and reinforcement, as described above. The trainer starts by identifying the desired final (or &quot;target&quot;) behavior. Next, the trainer chooses a behavior that the animal or person already emits with some probability. The form of this behavior is then gradually changed across successive trials by reinforcing behaviors that approximate the target behavior more and more closely. When the target behavior is finally emitted, it may be strengthened and maintained by the use of a schedule of reinforcement.

====Noncontingent reinforcement====
Noncontingent reinforcement is the delivery of reinforcing stimuli regardless of the organism&#x27;s behavior. Noncontingent reinforcement may be used in an attempt to reduce an undesired target behavior by reinforcing multiple alternative responses while extinguishing the target response. As no measured behavior is identified as being strengthened, there is controversy surrounding the use of the term noncontingent &quot;reinforcement&quot;.

===Stimulus control of operant behavior===

Though initially operant behavior is emitted without an identified reference to a particular stimulus, during operant conditioning operants come under the control of stimuli that are present when behavior is reinforced. Such stimuli are called &quot;discriminative stimuli.&quot; A so-called &quot;three-term contingency&quot; is the result. That is, discriminative stimuli set the occasion for responses that produce reward or punishment. Example: a rat may be trained to press a lever only when a light comes on; a dog rushes to the kitchen when it hears the rattle of his/her food bag; a child reaches for candy when s/he sees it on a table.

====Discrimination, generalization &amp; context====
Most behavior is under stimulus control. Several aspects of this may be distinguished: 
*Discrimination typically occurs when a response is reinforced only in the presence of a specific stimulus. For example, a pigeon might be fed for pecking at a red light and not at a green light; in consequence, it pecks at red and stops pecking at green. Many complex combinations of stimuli and other conditions have been studied; for example an organism might be reinforced on an interval schedule in the presence of one stimulus and on a ratio schedule in the presence of another. 
*Generalization is the tendency to respond to stimuli that are similar to a previously trained discriminative stimulus. For example, having been trained to peck at &quot;red&quot; a pigeon might also peck at &quot;pink&quot;, though usually less strongly.
*Context refers to stimuli that are continuously present in a situation, like the walls, tables, chairs, etc. in a room, or the interior of an operant conditioning chamber. Context stimuli may come to control behavior as do discriminative stimuli, though usually more weakly. Behaviors learned in one context may be absent, or altered, in another. This may cause difficulties for behavioral therapy, because behaviors learned in the therapeutic setting may fail to occur in other situations.

===Behavioral sequences: conditioned reinforcement and chaining===
Most behavior cannot easily be described in terms of individual responses reinforced one by one. The scope of operant analysis is expanded through the idea of behavioral chains, which are sequences of responses bound together by the three-term contingencies defined above. Chaining is based on the fact, experimentally demonstrated, that a discriminative stimulus not only sets the occasion for subsequent behavior, but it can also reinforce a behavior that precedes it. That is, a discriminative stimulus is also a &quot;conditioned reinforcer&quot;. For example, the light that sets the occasion for lever pressing may be used to reinforce &quot;turning around&quot; in the presence of a noise. This results in the sequence &quot;noise – turn-around – light – press lever – food&quot;. Much longer chains can be built by adding more stimuli and responses.

===Escape and avoidance===
In escape learning, a behavior terminates an (aversive) stimulus. For example, shielding one&#x27;s eyes from sunlight terminates the (aversive) stimulation of bright light in one&#x27;s eyes. (This is an example of negative reinforcement, defined above.) Behavior that is maintained by preventing a stimulus is called &quot;avoidance,&quot; as, for example, putting on sun glasses before going outdoors. Avoidance behavior raises the so-called &quot;avoidance paradox&quot;, for, it may be asked, how can the non-occurrence of a stimulus serve as a reinforcer? This question is addressed by several theories of avoidance (see below).

Two kinds of experimental settings are commonly used: discriminated and free-operant avoidance learning.

====Discriminated avoidance learning====
A discriminated avoidance experiment involves a series of trials in which a neutral stimulus such as a light is followed by an aversive stimulus such as a shock. After the neutral stimulus appears an operant response such as a lever press prevents or terminate the aversive stimulus. In early trials, the subject does not make the response until the aversive stimulus has come on, so these early trials are called &quot;escape&quot; trials. As learning progresses, the subject begins to respond during the neutral stimulus and thus prevents the aversive stimulus from occurring. Such trials are called &quot;avoidance trials.&quot; This experiment is said to involve classical conditioning because a neutral CS (conditioned stimulus) is paired with the aversive US (unconditioned stimulus); this idea underlies the two-factor theory of avoidance learning described below.

====Free-operant avoidance learning====
In free-operant avoidance a subject periodically receives an aversive stimulus (often an electric shock) unless an operant response is made; the response delays the onset of the shock. In this situation, unlike discriminated avoidance, no prior stimulus signals the shock. Two crucial time intervals determine the rate of avoidance learning. This first is the S-S (shock-shock) interval. This is time between successive shocks in the absence of a response. The second interval is the R-S (response-shock) interval. This specifies the time by which an operant response delays the onset of the next shock. Each time the subject performs the operant response, the R-S interval without shock begins anew.

====Two-process theory of avoidance====

This theory was originally proposed in order to explain discriminated avoidance learning, in which an organism learns to avoid an aversive stimulus by escaping from a signal for that stimulus. Two processes are involved: classical conditioning of the signal followed by operant conditioning of the escape response:

a) &quot;Classical conditioning of fear.&quot; Initially the organism experiences the pairing of a CS with an aversive US. The theory assumes that this pairing creates an association between the CS and the US through classical conditioning and, because of the aversive nature of the US, the CS comes to elicit a conditioned emotional reaction (CER) – &quot;fear.&quot; b) &quot;Reinforcement of the operant response by fear-reduction.&quot; As a result of the first process, the CS now signals fear; this unpleasant emotional reaction serves to motivate operant responses, and responses that terminate the CS are reinforced by fear termination. The theory does not say that the organism &quot;avoids&quot; the US in the sense of anticipating it, but rather that the organism &quot;escapes&quot; an aversive internal state that is caused by the CS.
Several experimental findings seem to run counter to two-factor theory. For example, avoidance behavior often extinguishes very slowly even when the initial CS-US pairing never occurs again, so the fear response might be expected to extinguish (see Classical conditioning). Further, animals that have learned to avoid often show little evidence of fear, suggesting that escape from fear is not necessary to maintain avoidance behavior.

====Operant or &quot;one-factor&quot; theory====
Some theorists suggest that avoidance behavior may simply be a special case of operant behavior maintained by its consequences. In this view the idea of &quot;consequences&quot; is expanded to include sensitivity to a pattern of events. Thus, in avoidance, the consequence of a response is a reduction in the rate of aversive stimulation. Indeed, experimental evidence suggests that a &quot;missed shock&quot; is detected as a stimulus, and can act as a reinforcer. Cognitive theories of avoidance take this idea a step farther. For example, a rat comes to &quot;expect&quot; shock if it fails to press a lever and to &quot;expect no shock&quot; if it presses it, and avoidance behavior is strengthened if these expectancies are confirmed.

===Operant hoarding===
Operant hoarding refers to the observation that rats reinforced in a certain way may allow food pellets to accumulate in a food tray instead of retrieving those pellets. In this procedure, retrieval of the pellets always instituted a one-minute period of extinction during which no additional food pellets were available but those that had been accumulated earlier could be consumed. This finding appears to contradict the usual finding that rats behave impulsively in situations in which there is a choice between a smaller food object right away and a larger food object after some delay. See schedules of reinforcement.

==Neurobiological correlates==

The first scientific studies identifying neurons that responded in ways that suggested they encode for conditioned stimuli came from work by Mahlon deLong and by R.T. Richardson. They showed that nucleus basalis neurons, which release acetylcholine broadly throughout the cerebral cortex, are activated shortly after a conditioned stimulus, or after a primary reward if no conditioned stimulus exists. These neurons are equally active for positive and negative reinforcers, and have been shown to be related to neuroplasticity in many cortical regions. Evidence also exists that dopamine is activated at similar times. There is considerable evidence that dopamine participates in both reinforcement and aversive learning. Dopamine pathways project much more densely onto frontal cortex regions. Cholinergic projections, in contrast, are dense even in the posterior cortical regions like the primary visual cortex. A study of patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, a condition attributed to the insufficient action of dopamine, further illustrates the role of dopamine in positive reinforcement. It showed that while off their medication, patients learned more readily with aversive consequences than with positive reinforcement. Patients who were on their medication showed the opposite to be the case, positive reinforcement proving to be the more effective form of learning when dopamine activity is high.

A neurochemical process involving dopamine has been suggested to underlie reinforcement. When an organism experiences a reinforcing stimulus, dopamine pathways in the brain are activated. This network of pathways &quot;releases a short pulse of dopamine onto many dendrites, thus broadcasting a global reinforcement signal to postsynaptic neurons.&quot; This allows recently activated synapses to increase their sensitivity to efferent (conducting outward) signals, thus increasing the probability of occurrence for the recent responses that preceded the reinforcement. These responses are, statistically, the most likely to have been the behavior responsible for successfully achieving reinforcement. But when the application of reinforcement is either less immediate or less contingent (less consistent), the ability of dopamine to act upon the appropriate synapses is reduced.

==Questions about the law of effect==
A number of observations seem to show that operant behavior can be established without reinforcement in the sense defined above. Most cited is the phenomenon of autoshaping (sometimes called &quot;sign tracking&quot;), in which a stimulus is repeatedly followed by reinforcement, and in consequence the animal begins to respond to the stimulus. For example, a response key is lighted and then food is presented. When this is repeated a few times a pigeon subject begins to peck the key even though food comes whether the bird pecks or not. Similarly, rats begin to handle small objects, such as a lever, when food is presented nearby. Strikingly, pigeons and rats persist in this behavior even when pecking the key or pressing the lever leads to less food (omission training). Another apparent operant behavior that appears without reinforcement is contrafreeloading.

These observations and others appear to contradict the law of effect, and they have prompted some researchers to propose new conceptualizations of operant reinforcement (e.g.) A more general view is that autoshaping is an instance of classical conditioning; the autoshaping procedure has, in fact, become one of the most common ways to measure classical conditioning. In this view, many behaviors can be influenced by both classical contingencies (stimulus-response) and operant contingencies (response-reinforcement), and the experimenter&#x27;s task is to work out how these interact.

== Applications ==

Reinforcement and punishment are ubiquitous in human social interactions, and a great many applications of operant principles have been suggested and implemented. The following are some examples.

===Addiction and dependence===

Positive and negative reinforcement play central roles in the development and maintenance of addiction and drug dependence. An addictive drug is intrinsically rewarding; that is, it functions as a primary positive reinforcer of drug use. The brain&#x27;s reward system assigns it incentive salience (i.e., it is &quot;wanted&quot; or &quot;desired&quot;), so as an addiction develops, deprivation of the drug leads to craving. In addition, stimuli associated with drug use – e.g., the sight of a syringe, and the location of use – become associated with the intense reinforcement induced by the drug. These previously neutral stimuli acquire several properties: their appearance can induce craving, and they can become conditioned positive reinforcers of continued use. Thus, if an addicted individual encounters one of these drug cues, a craving for the associated drug may reappear. For example, anti-drug agencies previously used posters with images of drug paraphernalia as an attempt to show the dangers of drug use. However, such posters are no longer used because of the effects of incentive salience in causing relapse upon sight of the stimuli illustrated in the posters.

In drug dependent individuals, negative reinforcement occurs when a drug is self-administered in order to alleviate or &quot;escape&quot; the symptoms of physical dependence (e.g., tremors and sweating) and/or psychological dependence (e.g., anhedonia, restlessness, irritability, and anxiety) that arise during the state of drug withdrawal.

===Animal training===

Animal trainers and pet owners were applying the principles and practices of operant conditioning long before these ideas were named and studied, and animal training still provides one of the clearest and most convincing examples of operant control. Of the concepts and procedures described in this article, a few of the most salient are the following: 
(a) availability of primary reinforcement (e.g. a bag of dog yummies); 
(b) the use of secondary reinforcement, (e.g. sounding a clicker immediately after a desired response, then giving yummy); 
(c) contingency, assuring that reinforcement (e.g. the clicker) follows the desired behavior and not something else; 
(d) shaping, as in gradually getting a dog to jump higher and higher; 
(e) intermittent reinforcement, as in gradually reducing the frequency of reinforcement to induce persistent behavior without satiation; 
(f) chaining, where a complex behavior is gradually constructed from smaller units.

===Applied behavior analysis===

Applied behavior analysis is the discipline initiated by B. F. Skinner that applies the principles of conditioning to the modification of socially significant human behavior. It uses the basic concepts of conditioning theory, including conditioned stimulus (SC), discriminative stimulus (Sd), response (R), and reinforcing stimulus (Srein or Sr for reinforcers, sometimes Save for aversive stimuli).

Practitioners of applied behavior analysis (ABA) bring these procedures, and many variations and developments of them, to bear on a variety of socially significant behaviors and issues. In many cases, practitioners use operant techniques to develop constructive, socially acceptable behaviors to replace aberrant behaviors. The techniques of ABA have been effectively applied in to such things as early intensive behavioral interventions for children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research on the principles influencing criminal behavior, HIV prevention, conservation of natural resources, education, gerontology, health and exercise, industrial safety, language acquisition, littering, medical procedures, parenting, psychotherapy, seatbelt use, severe mental disorders, sports, substance abuse, phobias, pediatric feeding disorders, and zoo management and care of animals. Some of these applications are among those described below.

=== Child behavior – parent management training ===

Providing positive reinforcement for appropriate child behaviors is a major focus of parent management training. Typically, parents learn to reward appropriate behavior through social rewards (such as praise, smiles, and hugs) as well as concrete rewards (such as stickers or points towards a larger reward as part of an incentive system created collaboratively with the child). In addition, parents learn to select simple behaviors as an initial focus and reward each of the small steps that their child achieves towards reaching a larger goal (this concept is called &quot;successive approximations&quot;).

===Economics===
Both psychologists and economists have become interested in applying operant concepts and findings to the behavior of humans in the marketplace. An example 
is the analysis of consumer demand, as indexed by the amount of a commodity that is purchased. In economics, the degree to which price influences consumption is called &quot;the price elasticity of demand.&quot; Certain commodities are more elastic than others; for example, a change in price of certain foods may have a large effect on the amount bought, while gasoline and other everyday consumables may be less affected by price changes. In terms of operant analysis, such effects may be interpreted in terms of motivations of consumers and the relative value of the commodities as reinforcers.

===Gambling – variable ratio scheduling===

As stated earlier in this article, a variable ratio schedule yields reinforcement after the emission of an unpredictable number of responses. This schedule typically generates rapid, persistent responding. Slot machines pay off on a variable ratio schedule, and they produce just this sort of persistent lever-pulling behavior in gamblers. The variable ratio payoff from slot machines and other forms of gambling has often been cited as a factor underlying gambling addiction.

===Military psychology===
Human beings have an innate resistance to killing and are reluctant to act in a direct, aggressive way towards members of their own species, even to save life. This resistance to killing has caused infantry to be remarkably inefficient throughout the history of military warfare.

This phenomenon was not understood until S.L.A. Marshall (Brigadier General and military historian) undertook interview studies of WWII infantry immediately following combat engagement. Marshall&#x27;s well-known and controversial book, Men Against Fire, revealed that only 15% of soldiers fired their rifles with the purpose of killing in combat. Following acceptance of Marshall&#x27;s research by the US Army in 1946, the Human Resources Research Office of the US Army began implementing new training protocols which resemble operant conditioning methods. Subsequent applications of such methods increased the percentage of soldiers able to kill to around 50% in Korea and over 90% in Vietnam. Revolutions in training included replacing traditional pop-up firing ranges with three-dimensional, man-shaped, pop-up targets which collapsed when hit. This provided immediate feedback and acted as positive reinforcement for a soldier&#x27;s behavior. Other improvements to military training methods have included the timed firing course; more realistic training; high repetitions; praise from superiors; marksmanship rewards; and group recognition. Negative reinforcement includes peer accountability or the requirement to retake courses. Modern military training conditions mid-brain response to combat pressure by closely simulating actual combat, using mainly Pavlovian classical conditioning and Skinnerian operant conditioning (both forms of behaviorism).Modern marksmanship training is such an excellent example of behaviorism that it has been used for years in the introductory psychology course taught to all cadets at the US Military Academy at West Point as a classic example of operant conditioning. In the 1980s, during a visit to West Point, B.F. Skinner identified modern military marksmanship training as a near-perfect application of operant conditioning.Lt. Col. Dave Grossman states about operant conditioning and US Military training that:It is entirely possible that no one intentionally sat down to use operant conditioning or behavior modification techniques to train soldiers in this area…But from the standpoint of a psychologist who is also a historian and a career soldier, it has become increasingly obvious to me that this is exactly what has been achieved.

=== Nudge theory ===

Nudge theory (or nudge) is a concept in behavioural science, political theory and economics which argues that indirect suggestions to try to achieve non-forced compliance can influence the motives, incentives and decision making of groups and individuals, at least as effectively – if not more effectively – than direct instruction, legislation, or enforcement.

===Praise===

The concept of praise as a means of behavioral reinforcement is rooted in B.F. Skinner&#x27;s model of operant conditioning. Through this lens, praise has been viewed as a means of positive reinforcement, wherein an observed behavior is made more likely to occur by contingently praising said behavior. Hundreds of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of praise in promoting positive behaviors, notably in the study of teacher and parent use of praise on child in promoting improved behavior and academic performance, but also in the study of work performance. Praise has also been demonstrated to reinforce positive behaviors in non-praised adjacent individuals (such as a classmate of the praise recipient) through vicarious reinforcement. Praise may be more or less effective in changing behavior depending on its form, content and delivery. In order for praise to effect positive behavior change, it must be contingent on the positive behavior (i.e., only administered after the targeted behavior is enacted), must specify the particulars of the behavior that is to be reinforced, and must be delivered sincerely and credibly.

Acknowledging the effect of praise as a positive reinforcement strategy, numerous behavioral and cognitive behavioral interventions have incorporated the use of praise in their protocols. The strategic use of praise is recognized as an evidence-based practice in both classroom management and parenting training interventions, though praise is often subsumed in intervention research into a larger category of positive reinforcement, which includes strategies such as strategic attention and behavioral rewards.

Several studies have been done on the effect cognitive-behavioral therapy and operant-behavioral therapy have on different medical conditions. When patients developed cognitive and behavioral techniques that changed their behaviors, attitudes, and emotions; their pain severity decreased. The results of these studies showed an influence of cognitions on pain perception and impact presented explained the general efficacy of Cognitive-Behavioral therapy (CBT) and Operant-Behavioral therapy (OBT).

===Video games===

The majority of video games are designed around a compulsion loop, adding a type of positive reinforcement through a variable rate schedule to keep the player playing. This can lead to the pathology of video game addiction.
As part of a trend in the monetization of video games during the 2010s, some games offered loot boxes as rewards or as items purchasable by real world funds. Boxes contains a random selection of in-game items. The practice has been tied to the same methods that slot machines and other gambling devices dole out rewards, as it follows a variable rate schedule. While the general perception that loot boxes are a form of gambling, the practice is only classified as such in a few countries. However, methods to use those items as virtual currency for online gambling or trading for real world money has created a skin gambling market that is under legal evaluation.

=== Operant Conditioning and Defensive Medicine ===

One of the many reasons proposed for the dramatic costs associated with healthcare is the practice of defensive medicine. Prabhu reviews the article by Cole and discusses how the responses of two groups of neurosurgeons are classic operant behavior. One group practice in a state with restrictions on medical lawsuits and the other group with no restrictions. The group of neurosurgeons were queried anonymously on their practice patterns. The physicians changed their practice in response to a negative feedback (fear from lawsuit) in the group that practiced in a state with no restrictions on medical lawsuits.

<doc id="128031" wikidata="Q753152" url="?curid=128031" title="Samson and Delilah (opera)">
<text>Samson and Delilah (), Op. 47, is a grand opera in three acts and four scenes by Camille Saint-Saëns to a French libretto by Ferdinand Lemaire. It was first performed in Weimar at the (Grand Ducal) Theater (now the Staatskapelle Weimar) on 2 December 1877 in a German translation.

The opera is based on the Biblical tale of Samson and Delilah found in Chapter 16 of the Book of Judges in the Old Testament. It is the only opera by Saint-Saëns that is regularly performed. The second act love scene in Delilah&#x27;s tent is one of the set pieces that define French opera. Two of Delilah&#x27;s arias are particularly well known: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Spring begins&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;My heart opens itself to your voice&quot;, also known as &quot;Softly awakes my heart&quot;), the latter of which is one of the most popular recital pieces in the mezzo-soprano/contralto repertoire.

==Composition history==
In the middle of the 19th century, a revival of interest in choral music swept France, and Saint-Saëns, an admirer of the oratorios of Handel and Mendelssohn, made plans to compose an oratorio on the subject of Samson and Delilah as suggested by Voltaire&#x27;s libretto &quot;Samson&quot; for Rameau. The composer began work on the theme in 1867, just two years after completing his first (and as then yet unperformed) opera, &quot;Le timbre d&#x27;argent&quot;. Saint-Saëns had approached Ferdinand Lemaire, the husband of one of his wife&#x27;s cousins, about writing a libretto for the oratorio but Lemaire convinced the composer that the story was better suited to an opera.

Saint-Saëns later wrote: A young relative of mine had married a charming young man who wrote verse on the side. I realized that he was gifted and had in fact real talent. I asked him to work with me on an oratorio on a biblical subject. &#x27;An oratorio!&#x27;, he said, &#x27;no, let&#x27;s make it an opera!&#x27;, and he began to dig through the Bible while I outlined the plan of the work, even sketching scenes, and leaving him only the versification to do. For some reason I began the music with act 2, and I played it at home to a select audience who could make nothing of it at all.

After Lemaire finished the libretto, Saint-Saëns began actively composing act 2 of the opera, producing an aria for Dalila, a duet for Samson and Dalila, and some musical pieces for the chorus (some of which were later assigned to act 1) during 1867–1869. From the very beginning, the work was conceived as a grand duet between Samson and Dalila set off against the approaching tempest. Although the orchestration was not yet complete, act 2 was presented in a private performance in 1870 just prior to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War with Saint-Saëns playing the orchestral parts, which were largely improvised, on the piano. Composer Augusta Holmès (Dalila), painter Henri Regnault (Samson), and Romain Bussine (High Priest) rendered their roles from part books.
In spite of many precedents, the French public reacted negatively to Saint-Saëns&#x27;s intention of putting a Biblical subject on the stage. The alarm on the part of the public caused him to abandon working further on the opera for the next two years.

In the summer of 1872, not too long after the premiere of Saint-Saëns&#x27;s second opera &quot;La princesse jaune&quot;, the composer went to Weimar to see the first revival of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; under the baton of Franz Liszt, the former musical director of the Weimar court orchestra and opera. Liszt was highly interested in producing new works by talented composers and persuaded Saint-Saëns to finish &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;, even offering to produce the completed work at the grand-ducal opera house in Weimar. Encouraged, Saint-Saëns began composing act 1 in late 1872 and worked on it sporadically for the next few years. He wrote a large amount of act 1 and completed it during a trip to Algiers in 1874. Upon returning to France in 1875, Saint-Saëns presented act 1 in Paris at the Théâtre du Châtelet in a similar format as the 1870 performance of act 2. The work was harshly received by music critics and failed to gain the public&#x27;s interest. That year acclaimed mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot, for whom Saint-Saëns wrote the role of Dalila, organized and performed in a private performance of act 2 at a friend&#x27;s home in Croissy, with the composer at the piano. Viardot was a great admirer of the work and she hoped that this private performance would encourage Halanzier, the director of the Paris Opéra who was in attendance, to mount a full production. Although Saint-Saëns completed the score in 1876, no opera houses in France displayed any desire to stage &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot;. Liszt&#x27;s sustained support however led to the work being mounted in Weimar in 1877.

==Performance history==

===Premiere in Weimar===
Although Liszt was no longer the musical director in Weimar, he still exerted a powerful influence at the Weimar court. Eduard Lassen, the director who followed Liszt at Weimar, owed much of his success to his celebrated predecessor, and Liszt used his influence to arrange the premiere of &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; with Lassen on the podium during the 1877/1878 season. The libretto was duly translated into German for the production and the opera&#x27;s first performance was given on 2 December 1877 at the Grossherzogliches Theatre (Grand Ducal Theater). Viardot was too old to sing Delilah so the role was entrusted to Auguste von Müller, a resident performer at the Weimar opera house. Although a resounding success with the Weimar critics and audience, the opera was not immediately revived in other opera houses.

===Beginning of international popularity in the 1890s===
After the numerous setbacks it suffered in its early years, &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; finally began to attract the attention of the world&#x27;s great opera houses during the 1890s. Although the next new production of &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; was in Germany at the Hamburg State Opera in 1882, afterwards the opera was not seen again until it was performed for the first time in France at the Théâtre des Arts in Rouen on 3 March 1890 with Carlotta Bossi as Dalila and Jean-Alexandre Talazac as Samson. The opera received its Paris premiere at the Éden-Théâtre on 31 October 1890 with Rosine Bloch as Dalila and Talazac singing Samson once again, this time with a much warmer reception by Paris audiences. Over the next two years, performances were given in Bordeaux, Geneva, Toulouse, Nantes, Dijon, and Montpellier. The Paris Opéra finally staged the opera on 23 November 1892 in a performance under the supervision of Saint-Saëns conducted by Édouard Colonne with Blanche Deschamps-Jéhin as Dalila and Edmond Vergnet as Samson. Directed by Lapissida, the staging had costumes by Charles Bianchini and sets by Amable and Eugène Gardy (acts 1 and 2), and Eugène Carpezat (act 3). The performance was lauded by critics and spectators alike.

&quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; also earned a great deal of popularity outside France during the 1890s. The opera debuted successfully in Monaco at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo on 15 March 1892. This was followed by the opera&#x27;s United States premiere at Carnegie Hall in a concert version on 24 March 1892 by the Oratorio Society of New York, conducted by Walter Damrosch. The first staged performance of the opera in the U.S. was held at the French Opera House, New Orleans on 4 January 1893. The first of many productions at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City was held on 2 February 1895, with Eugenia Mantelli as Dalila, Francesco Tamagno as Samson, and Pol Plançon portraying both Abimélech and the Old Hebrew. There is some evidence that the sets for the Met&#x27;s production had been taken from some of their other operas, and at the second performance that season the work was given in concert, with the ballet sequences omitted; in this form the work traveled to Boston, where it was performed on 3 March 1895.

The opera made its premiere in Italy at the Teatro Pagliano (Teatro Verdi (Florence)) on 26 March 1892. The opera was given in Venice at the Teatro La Fenice on 8 March 1893 with Elisa Persini as Dalila and Augusto Brogi as Samson. The work was first given at La Scala on 17 January 1895 with Renée Vidal as Dalila and Emanuele Lafarge as Samson. This was followed by its first performance at the Teatro Regio di Torino on 6 January 1897 with Alice Cucini and Irma De Spagni alternating as Dalila and Hector Dupeyron as Samson. The work was first performed at the Teatro Regio di Parma that same year and was mounted at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna in 1899.

In England, the opera was first performed on 25 September 1893 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Although the company planned on performing the work in a fully staged production, the Lord Chamberlain objected to a Biblical work being mounted and the company was forced to present the opera in a concert version. It was not staged in London until 1909 when the ban was finally lifted. Louise Kirkby Lunn portrayed Dalila and Charles Fontaine portrayed Samson in the 1909 production. Subsequently, Paul Franz replaced Fontaine in the protagonist&#x27;s role, earning the composer&#x27;s praise for both the quality of his voice and his interpretation.

===20th and 21st century performance history===

By 1906, &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; had received more than 200 performances internationally. The opera has continued to remain moderately popular since and, while not being among the most frequently performed operas, the work has become a part of the standard opera performance repertory at most major opera houses. The opera has been revived numerous times not only in Europe and North America, but also in South America, Australia, and Asia. While none of Saint-Saëns&#x27;s later operas suffered the tribulations endured by &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; during its early years, none of his other works have achieved the same enduring success either.

In North America, French contralto Jeanne Gerville-Réache is largely credited for popularizing the work in the United States and Canada during the early twentieth century. Réache first performed the role of Delilah with the Manhattan Opera Company in New York City in 1908 and went on to sing the role several more times over the next seven years, including performances in Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, and Montreal (for the Canadian premiere in 1915).

The Metropolitan Opera revived the opera in its 1915/1916 season with Margaret Matzenauer as Delilah, Enrico Caruso as Samson, and Pasquale Amato as the High Priest. Since then the company has staged productions of the opera at least once every decade giving more than 200 performances of the work. Plácido Domingo performed as Samson in the 1981 San Francisco Opera production co-starring Shirley Verrett, under Julius Rudel and at the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s 1998 production with Olga Borodina. More recent productions of the opera by the Metropolitan have been in 2006, with Marina Domashenko and Olga Borodina alternating as Delilah, and in 2018 with Elīna Garanča and Roberto Alagna. The Lyric Opera of Chicago gave their first performance of the opera in November 1962 with Rita Gorr as Delilah and as Samson. The company has revived the work numerous times since then, most recently in their 2003/2004 season with Olga Borodina as Dalila and José Cura as Samson. Likewise, the San Francisco Opera has staged the opera 10 times during its history giving its first performance in 1925, with Marguerite d&#x27;Alvarez and Fernand Ansseau in the principal roles, and its most recent performance in 2008, with Borodina and Clifton Forbis.

&quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; became a consistent presence in the opera houses of Europe. By 1920, the Paris Opéra alone had given more than five hundred performances of the opera. In the decades after World War II, it was less often heard by European audiences; but since the 1980s it has regained much of its former Continental popularity. Recent European productions include performances at La Scala, Milan, in 2002 (Domingo and Borodina); the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 2004 (Denyce Graves and José Cura) and again in 2022; the Royal Swedish Opera in 2008 (Anna Larsson and Lars Cleveman).

Throughout its history, &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; has served as a star vehicle for many singers. The role of Delilah is considered to be one of the great opera roles for the mezzo-soprano.

==Libretto==
Although the libretto of &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; is taken from Chapter 16 of the Book of Judges, the opera does not include the accounts of Samson&#x27;s heroic deeds which earned him both fame and leadership among the Hebrews. The accounts of Samson&#x27;s slaying of a lion and his triumph over 1000 Philistines while wielding only the jawbone of an ass are omitted. Saint-Saëns and his librettist most likely made this choice so the story would concentrate on Dalila. Samson, therefore, is presented as an inspiring leader rather than the almost supernatural hero of the Bible. It is his vulnerable, tender heart and his susceptibility to the protestations of love from a dissembling woman that is the focus of the plot. Delilah is portrayed as a manipulative, conniving, ruthless woman bent on revenge. Samson&#x27;s numerous attempts to conceal the secret of his strength in the Biblical account are only referenced by Dalila in her duet with the High Priest in the opera, and the revelation that his strength resides in his hair occurs offstage. The opera includes some material not found in the Bible such as the death of Abimélech in act 1.

== Roles ==

== Synopsis ==
:Place: Gaza
:Time: c. 1150 BC

=== Act 1 ===
&quot;A square in Gaza at night&quot;

In a square outside the temple of Dagon, a group of Hebrews beg Jehovah for relief from their bondage to the Philistines in a melancholy chorus (&quot;Dieu d&#x27;Israël – God of Israel&quot;), which leads into a fugue (&quot;Nous avons vu nos cités renversées – We have seen our cities overturned&quot;). Samson tries to revive the Israelites&#x27; morale and faith in God (&quot;Arrêtez, ô mes frères – Stop, O my brothers&quot;) in a rousing aria set against the chorus&#x27;s continuous prayer. Abimelech, the Philistine governor, appears and taunts the Israelites, saying that they are helpless because their god has abandoned them. He further states that his god, Dagon, is far superior (&quot;Ce Dieu que votre voix implore – This God that your voice implores&quot;). The Hebrews cower in fear before Abimelech until Samson incites them into defiant action. Enraged, Abimelech attacks an unarmed Samson with his sword. Samson manages to wrest the sword from Abimelech and kills him.

Afraid of what might now happen, the Hebrews flee, abandoning Samson. The High Priest of Dagon comes from the Philistine temple and curses the Hebrews and Samson&#x27;s prodigious strength. A messenger arrives and informs the High Priest that the Hebrews are destroying the harvest. He responds with a further curse that alludes to his plot to utilize Dalila&#x27;s beauty to outwit Samson&#x27;s strength (&quot;Qu&#x27;enfin une compagne infâme trahisse son amour! – Finally an infamous companion betrays his love!&quot;).

As dawn breaks the Hebrews lift up a humble prayer to God in a style reminiscent of plainchant. Out of the temple emerges Dalila along with several priestesses of Dagon. As they walk down the temple steps, they sing of the pleasures of spring. Dalila engages seductively with Samson proclaiming that he has won her heart and bids him to come with her to her home in the valley of Sorek. As she tries to charm him, a trio forms as an old Hebrew warns of the danger this woman presents and Samson prays for God&#x27;s protection from Dalila&#x27;s charms. In an attempt to seduce Samson away from his leadership of the Israelite uprising, Dalila and the priestesses begin a sexually charged dance for him accompanied by a tambourine. After the dance, Dalila sings how spring is blossoming all around her yet, in her heart, she feels like it is still winter (&quot;Printemps qui commence – Spring begins&quot;). As Samson struggles with his desire for Dalila, the old Hebrew repeats his cautionary plea. His warning, however, is made in vain and the curtain closes as Samson meets Dalila&#x27;s gaze with every intention of going to her nearby dwelling.

=== Act 2 ===
&quot;Delilah&#x27;s retreat in the Valley of Sorek&quot;

Dalila knows that Samson is entranced with her and will come to her instead of leading the revolution against the Philistines. Sitting on a rock outside the entrance to her retreat, she sings triumphantly about her power to ensnare Samson. She says that all of his strength is hopeless to withstand love&#x27;s onslaught (&quot;Amour! viens aider ma faiblesse – Love! come help my weakness&quot;).

Distant lightning is seen as the High Priest arrives to report that Samson and the Hebrews have conquered the Philistines. He attempts to achieve Samson&#x27;s capture by offering Dalila gold, but she refuses saying she cares not for money but only for revenge. Her desire to hurt Samson is motivated solely by her loyalty to her gods and her hatred for the Hebrews. Dalila and the High Priest sing a duet expressing their mutual abhorrence for Samson and the Hebrews. Dalila vows to discover the secret of Samson&#x27;s strength.

Now alone, Dalila contemplates her chances of success. Samson, intent on taking his place as the leader of the Hebrew revolt, emerges to say his last farewell as distant lightning is once again seen. In an attempt to close the trap which she has set for Samson, Dalila tells Samson seductively that she is completely his if he wants her. She begs him to respond to her caresses, hoping that he will finally let go of all other things and concentrate completely on her. His admission &quot;Je t&#x27;aime!&quot; introduces her main aria &quot;Mon cœur s&#x27;ouvre à ta voix – My heart opens to your voice&quot;, which becomes a duet on the second verse when Samson joins her in song. Now that Dalila has him in her power, she feigns disbelief in his constancy and demands that he show his love by confiding in her the secret of his strength. Samson hears rolling thunder again which now seems like a warning from God and refuses. Dalila weeps and scorns Samson and runs into her dwelling. Samson is momentarily torn but then follows Dalila inside. Not long afterward, having finally learned that the secret of Samson&#x27;s strength is his long hair, she calls to hidden Philistine soldiers, who rush in to capture and blind Samson.

=== Act 3 ===
&quot;The city of Gaza&quot;

&quot;Scene 1: In a dungeon at Gaza&quot;

His hair shorn and now blind and shackled, Samson is turning a mill-wheel and praying for his people, who will suffer for his sin. He hears their voices, echoing the Hebrews&#x27; lament from act 1. Overcome with remorse, Samson offers his life in sacrifice, while the Hebrews are heard in the distance lamenting his fate.

&quot;Scene 2: In the Temple of Dagon&quot;

A musical interlude is played as the scene changes to the temple of Dagon, where the Philistines are preparing a sacrifice to commemorate their victory. The priests and priestesses of Dagon sing softly, reprising the song to spring from act 1. The music turns savage as the priests dance a wild Bacchanale. Following the dance, Samson enters led by a boy. He is ridiculed by the High Priest and the crowd. Dalila taunts Samson further by recounting to him the details of her devious plot in a variant of her love song. When the priests try to force him to kneel before Dagon, he asks the boy to lead him to the two main pillars of the temple, then telling the child to flee. Samson prays to God to restore his strength, and pushes down the pillars and the temple with them, crushing himself and his enemies. The curtain falls.

A fire that burned through much of the town on April 1, 1904, destroying many businesses and led to the decline of nearby lumber mills. In 1909, William C. Chance founded the Higgs Industrial School for African Americans (also known as the Parmele Industrial Institute) which at its peak occupied a six-building campus and merged with the town&#x27;s public school. The school was closed following a fire at its main building in 1954.

==History==
The earliest known citizens of the Robersonville area were the Tuscarora and Morotock Native Americans. However, according to various deeds, family bibles, wills, and church records, settlers arrived many years before the Revolutionary War. One of the earliest known churches of the area was Flat Swamp Primitive Baptist Church, founded in 1776. Among the early settlers of this area was the family of Henry Robason, who is said to have been born in 1710 in England. Eventually the family name became &quot;Roberson&quot; and the family tree grew throughout the region. Before the Civil War, George O. Roberson and his father, William, owned a store originally located on the northwest corner of what is now known as Railroad and Roberson Streets. The local militia trained at this store during the Civil War. After returning from the war, George built a store across the street from the original one.

When the town was incorporated February 16, 1872, it became the first town in Martin County not located on the Roanoke River; thus, it wasn&#x27;t dependent on the river for communication with other settlements. Instead, the railroad was the main artery of communication and trade. The town was named after Henry, William, and George Roberson. Of the 3 brothers, Henry D. Roberson is considered to the &quot;Father of Robersonville.&quot; He served as director, stockholder, and one of the foremost promoters of the railroad that ran from Williamston to Tarboro. It was first known as the Williamston and Tarboro R.R., but, the name was soon changed to Seaboard and Raleigh R.R., then the Albemarle and Raleigh R.R., and is now part of the Atlantic Coast Line system. Although the Seaboard and Raleigh Railway Company would not be incorporated until late 1873, town founders envisioned it as a prominent trading center and market for western Martin County. Growing slowly during its first decade, after the railroad&#x27;s completion in October 1882, the town had eleven general stores, two physicians, and a number of industries by 1884. The population was then 400 residents, with an influx of farm families and ambitious young men moving here because of various entrepreneurial, educational, and social opportunities. The first mayor was William W. Roberson. The original town commissioners were Henry D. Roberson, Staton Everett, and Eli Askew. Vance L. Roberson served the longest tenure of public service of any Robersonville citizen. Henry Staton Everett served longer than any other mayor.

In the late 1800s, the Jewish Agricultural Society, helped many Jewish families relocate from Russia to the United States. While most of these families settled in the Northeast, a few were relocated to eastern North Carolina due to its agrarian-based economy and abundance of affordable land. Most notably the Margolis, Smith (Schmidt), and Bernstein families came to the Robersonville area in the early 1900s and took to farming in addition to owning department stores and shops. In 1902, Adath Shalom (Congregation of Peace) was established. The first synagogue was built in 1907 and existed until it caught fire in the late 1940s. Afterward, most families attended religious services in nearby Rocky Mount. The handful of Jewish families, which resided in Robersonville and nearby Williamston, either died or relocated to larger cities with the Margolis family being one of the last to leave in the 1990s.

Postal Service began on July 10, 1874, with Wilson T. Outterbridge as the first postmaster. Mrs. Geneva Weaver served the longest term of any Robersonville postmaster. The first electric plant was built around 1914 and was privately owned and operated. Around 1940, the town contracted to buy current from Greenville. After World War II, a contract was negotiated with Virginia Electric &amp; Power. Later, Carolina Power &amp; Light was used. At one time, J.S. (Jim) Simpson supervised the distribution and maintenance of electricity, under the direction of Town Manager James E. Gray and Clerk Alice Briley. Today, the town has a contract with Electricities, Inc. The water and sewage disposal system was installed in 1924.

The Robersonville Primitive Baptist Church was founded in 1883. The land was given for the sole purpose of building a house of public worship and school. The original church was dismantled in 1883 and the present sanctuary completed the same year. The building was later restored in the 1990s by Dr. Everette James and is now home to the St. James Place Museum, one of the oldest buildings in town. This restored historical landmark serves as a fascinating museum of southern folk art. The late, clapboard Gothic-revival architecture church building now houses original furnishings, folk art, and antique duck decoys. More than 100 North Carolina quilts, including 42 African-American examples, and hundreds of pieces of North Carolina pottery are exhibited. This museum located on the corner of old U.S. 64 and Outerbridge St., is open year-round daily by appointment. Visitors should schedule free tours through the Robersonville Town Library.

As site of the county&#x27;s first tobacco market on August 7, 1900, Robersonville embarked on a second, more expansive era of prosperity, civic progress, and development with a population that surged up to 1,200 during the early 20th century. The town was becoming a rural trading center and market for agricultural commodities. The tobacco market was once reported to be the largest in the world with a single set of buyers. Mr. J.C. Andrews was chosen as &quot;soliciting agent&quot; to seek subscriptions to buy the land necessary for the market. In 1903, he and Mr. J.W. Ferrell purchased the Carolina and Southern Warehouses. Taylor Warehouse opened that same year and was run by W.H. Adkins, J.H. Taylor, and R.A. Bailey. These warehouses changed hands and names many times. In 1930, the New Red Front Warehouse was built and operated by Jimmie Taylor and Jim Gray. In the same year, Haywood Everett and J.R. Morris were the managers of Central Warehouse. The Adkins and Bailey Warehouse, which used to be Taylor Warehouse was now under management of W.H. Adkins and R.A. Bailey. In 1947, the Planters Warehouse was built on the opposite side of town from the other three. Mr. E.G. Anderson and Mr. H.T. Highsmith were the proprietors of the warehouse. In the spring of 1968, the Adkins and Bailey Warehouse burned down. Mr. James E. Gray financed the rebuilding of a new warehouse on the same spot. The new Gray&#x27;s Warehouse was opened in the 1968 season. In 1971, Planters Warehouse was purchased by Mr. Norman Hardee and Mr. Edwin Lee. They renamed it Hardee&#x27;s Warehouse. Also that year, Gray&#x27;s, Red front, and Central Warehouses were under the ownership of James E. Gray, Jim Gray, R.K. Adkins, and Jack Sharp, taking the place of his late father-in-law, Mr. Charlie Gray. In 1973, Mr. James E. Gray died and his son, Harry Gray, took over his position. The tobacco market in Martin County did very well until 2001 when the larger companies began to contract directly with the grower.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Eddie Vanderford and Harry Gray (Gray&#x27;s Red Front and Central Whse), and Kenneth Roberson (Hardee&#x27;s Whse.) were running the auction sales in Robersonville. In 2001, Harry Gray leased Gray&#x27;s Warehouse to Philip Morris as a tobacco receiving station and Mr. Gray contracted tobacco through Lester Warren, station operator and agent for Philip Morris. In 2008, Harry Gray retired from the tobacco business and Alliance One International took over the receiving station with Mr. Warren still the operator. In fact, Robersonville still has a tobacco market receiving station, the only one in the area and Mr. Gray is still leasing the warehouse to Alliance One. There is more tobacco grown in the Robersonville area today then in many years due to increased demand and having the local tobacco receiving station. Robersonville has had a tobacco market since 1900. Central Warehouse and the Red Front Warehouses have been razed. Hardee&#x27;s Warehouse is now owned by the Roberson&#x27;s &quot;Scattered Acres Farms.&quot; Gray&#x27;s Warehouse is still receiving tobacco and tobacco is still King. Cotton is also one of the biggest cash crops. The growth of new industries brought new residential areas which opened to provide homes for the town&#x27;s increased population – most notably New Town, a residential neighborhood that would become one of eastern North Carolina&#x27;s most cohesive and civic-minded early 20th-century African-American communities.

The newly acquired prosperity, improved educational opportunities, and modern municipal services fostered a lively cultural and social life in town, where entertaining diversions and several cultural, civic, and social groups flourished. Even during the Great Depression, economic expansion slowed drastically in Robersonville, but the municipality benefited from state and federal relief programs. Inexpensive sports and popular social pastimes, such as Little League Baseball and bridge, also eased the hardships for many during those rough years.

Robersonville soon developed into a leader of the Industrial Revolution, which has characterized the economy of Martin County in the last half-century. In 1910, the Robersonville Hosiery and Manufacturing Co. was incorporated. In 1912, the firm was reorganized as Robersonville-Tar River Hosiery Mill, Inc. The ruins of this brick building still stand on the corner of N. Railroad and Mill Streets. Most of the industry – a large cotton ginning plant, lumber mills, and grist mills – in the early part of the 20th century focused on the handling of agricultural or lumber products. Southeastern Tobacco Co. operated a large tobacco re-drying and stemming plant for many years. John Henry Roberson, Jr., a direct descendant of the founders of Robersonville, owned his own farm south of Robersonville, and was involved in many civic affairs with his brothers David Roberson and Grover H. Roberson. Grover H. Roberson left the Robersonville area in early 1940 to join the U.S. Navy. Grover saw action at the Battle of Anzio. After the Battle of Anzio, Grover was in the company of a group of other naval officers and had a special audience with Pope Pius XII at the Vatican in Rome, Italy.

Some of the early industries were not directly related to agriculture. The D.B. Parker Buggy Co. began in 1903 and operated until its product was replaced by the automobile. Established in 1905, the Carolina Brick Co. made ornamental bricks with a capacity of 30,000 daily. Since the late 1950s, a wider range of industry has appeared. In 1958, a poultry processing company was opened by Austin Farms. This plant was later purchased by Central Soya of Athens, Inc. and then later owned by Perdue. Also in 1958, Robersonville Manufacturing Co. was chartered as a maker of children&#x27;s clothes. John Henry Roberson, Jr. lived on Broad Street and worked in the local tobacco market for many years. It expanded and was acquired by Blue Gem, which had its origins as the Hamilton Pants Manufacturing Company. Later it was changed to Southern Apparel. Robersonville Products Co. opened in 1970. As a division of Hallmark, it produced display fixtures for retail stores. After closing in 1993, the building was used by Empire Brush Company. Also in 1970, Blue Ridge Shoe Co. opened and began making children&#x27;s shoes. Later the building was bought by Sandra Manufacturing Co., a sewing plant later known as Generation II, and then later as Ithaca Inc. and recently Caraustar. Microcell Corp., a hydrogen fuel company is moving into the old Caraustar building. Carolina Peanuts was started by locals as a small company but later grew after being acquired by Anheuser-Busch. Eagle Snacks later changed to Guy Snacks and for years was known as Ann&#x27;s House of Nuts. Today, it is owned by Flagstone Foods based out of Minneapolis, MN.

Today the town&#x27;s biggest entertainment venue is East Carolina Motor Speedway, a racetrack. East Carolina Motor Speedway opened its first season in 1989 with the thoughts of having a much needed attraction for racing fans throughout Eastern North Carolina. This D-shaped, 3/8 mile track has 24 degree banking in its turns as well as 10 degree banking on its straight-a-ways. The track is 40 feet wide, allowing cars to run three-wide for added excitement to its spectators. The grandstand can seat 3,000 fans and VIP booths located in turn four provide a first-class view of the entire track and pit area.

The Filling Station Restaurant has an interesting historical artifact. In the 1940s, Bill Bemis worked at Jim Johnson&#x27;s store in nearby Gold Point, North Carolina and painted pictures for a hobby. Using enamel paints, he created a mural on the inside walls of the store. The mural depicts then store owner Jim Johnson and his daughters Mable and Peggy and their dog, in a fox hunt scene. This store was later called the Grant Vandiford store until it was moved to Robersonville to be part of the dining room of the Filling Station Restaurant. After the move, Bill Bemis retouched his work, so, the fox hunt mural is as bright and colorful today as it was 60 years ago.

The volunteer fire department was first organized in 1924 with William Gray as the first fire chief and police chief. The rescue squad was organized in 1959 and was the first one in Martin County. It was sponsored by the Junior Chamber of Commerce (Jay Cee&#x27;s) under the leadership of John L. House and Robert E. Lee. A municipal building houses the police, fire, and rescue departments as well as the public library.

Although the railroad has been replaced by the new US 64 Bypass as the town&#x27;s main link to the outside world, Robersonville continues to thrive, providing needed services, industry and entertainment to local and out-of-town residents alike.

The first classes were held in 1881 at the Stonewall Masonic Hall on Main Street. Built in 1871, this is one of the oldest building still standing in Robersonville. Mr. Stephen W. Outterbridge (Born January 23, 1825-Died January 28, 1915) taught at the masonic hall from 1885 until 1896 and at his private school located beside his home on Outerbridge Street until 1900. Commencement for the Robersonville school was conducted in the Masonic Hall in the late 19th century and later had to be held in the upstairs of what is now the Smith building when attendance grew. Later, students would take a special train that was run from Oak City via Parmele and Robersonville to graduation services in Williamston and back for the all-day occasion. Later, Robersonville began to hold its own commencement again. Students received music lessons on the pipe organ located in the Disciples of Christ Church located next door to the masonic hall. Stephen Outterbridge could be called the Father of Education in Robersonville. Both he and his wife Susan were admired greatly by the citizens of Robersonville. Although they never had biological children of their own, they molded the characters of many local youth. They helped to open Robersonville Graded School. 

The tobacco market caused an economic boom and encouraged the town to file a special deed in the Register of Deeds office May 6, 1902. In 1902, Mr. C. H. McLaurin became the first principal of Robersonville Graded School and served three years. Students came in from surrounding areas to board in local rooms and go to school. Mr. John Dawson Everett, Robersonville native and a graduate of Peabody College, came from Bethel in 1905 to become principal and remained through 1909. He and Miss Lelia Thornton and Miss Dora Mae Krider taught the first high school subjects. Miss Ethel Peele was the first female graduate in 1908, while Mr. C. Abram Roberson was the first male graduate. The 10th grade was added in 1912, and the eleventh grade added in 1917. Mr. William Gray, Mr. Thomas House and Mr. C. Abram Roberson, senior students, helped to plant cedar trees in front of the academy, in honor of Prof. and Mrs. Outterbridge at the time of their retirement. Two trees were planted. One was named Stephen and one Susan. The town had a rural librarian until a library room was added to the wood frame graded school in 1918.

When Parmele, Everetts, and Gold Point Schools consolidated with Robersonville, more space was needed. In January 1924, Robersonville&#x27;s first brick building was opened for the white students on the same lot as the previous wood-framed structure, which was sold in two sections, one of which became a new colored school. The new white building, built at a cost of $62,406, had six grammar school and four high school teachers on the staff, including the principal, Mr. G. W. Rhodes. Improved facilities not enjoyed before included electric lights, running water, inside toilets, and janitor service. Telephone service was installed in 1926. Also in that year, the Robersonville Graded School district surrendered its private charter and became part of the Martin County System of Public Schools. The Betterment Association raised money for auditorium curtains and planted shrubbery in front of the building. In the summer of 1949, the county renovated by painting the inside of the building; adding new desks, new furniture in the library, a new foundation, and a new roof; and updating the electrical system. Outterbridge Grammar School was the first accredited grammar school in Martin County. 
A few blocks away on Academy Street, another brick school was built and occupied in September 1929. The first commencement exercises in the new Robersonville High School auditorium were held in April 1930. Public school music began in 1930. The school consists of sixteen rooms including; an auditorium and gymnasium, a suite of rooms set aside for home economics, a music room, principal&#x27;s office, a library, and classrooms.
In 1936 a brick school was built on Cochran Street for black students in the southeastern section of Robersonville called New Town. The building consisted of eight classrooms, an auditorium, library, storage room, and an office. One of the classrooms was used for a lunchroom. The staff consisted of six teachers and Principal Armistead. At that time it was called Robersonville Colored Graded School. After Mr. Armistead died, Mr. N.W. Slade became principal in 1940.

In 1931, Mrs. Betty Gray used the old home economics room of the grammar school building to start the School Lunchroom Program, mainly to supplement the diet of needy children. Without a market for their produce, many farmers were glad to exchange chickens, eggs, ham, milk, etc., for meals for their children. Under the guidance of the Woman&#x27;s Club, with Mrs. Vernon Ward, Mrs. Haywood Wilson, and Mrs. Betty Gray, summer garden and canning projects served to stock the lunchroom. In 1939–40 more than 110 lunches were furnished daily, about 95 of which were free. Mrs. Betty Gray worked as a volunteer in the lunchroom for five years. Mr. Marvin Everett, Building Principal of the Outterbridge Grammar School, assumed the business management of the lunchroom in 1938–48. A ruling was passed in 1944 requesting pupils of the grammar school to bring lunch and eat in the lunchroom. An important by-product of the lunchroom was the group feeling that was created by all eating together.

A high school lunchroom was maintained for two years, 1944–46, under the management of Mr. A. L. Hendron, principal. When vocational agriculture was resumed in the teaching program following the War in 1947–48, the agriculture building being used at the time as a lunchroom, had to be vacated. The high school students now bought tickets in advance and ate in the grammar school lunchroom. A new graded school lunchroom, built in 1948, continued to be used for both schools until the high school gained its own new lunchroom in 1954.

From 1936 until 1942, Mr. J. E. Aiken served as band leader. When he served in World War II, his wife took over for him. The key to the success of the band was in the material cooperation given by the patrons and parents. The patrons aided through the Robersonville Chamber of Commerce. It needed the band&#x27;s participation in town festivals and parades in the surrounding area in support of the local tobacco market. After the gym, physical education room, and band room were built, the band was organized in December 1952 with Mr. E. C. Black as director. Mr. Joseph Secrest later replaced Mr. Black as band director.

After the construction in 1939 of a vocational agriculture building, the third vocational course was added to the curriculum. Also in 1939, the twelfth grade was added.

A community building, also called the teacherage, was constructed across from the grammar school in 1942 at a cost of $14,000. Before that time, teachers had boarded and roomed in private homes, the Wilson Hotel, and in the Paul D. Roberson apartment house.

In 1947, a gymnasium was built. In 1949, an outdoor athletic field was developed near the old Perdue plant, which benefited both the high school and the town of Robersonville. In 1952, an all-purpose home making department was built along with a foyer for the RHS gymnasium. This allowed the library to expand in the main building of the high school. Special Education was also added that year.

When the Parmele colored high school burned down in 1953, Martin County spent $210,000 to build East End High School on land adjoining the existing elementary school for blacks. Mr. Slade was principal with N. B. Jones as assistant principal.

The hazardous and dangerous situation then still existing at each end of Outterbridge Grammar School was corrected in 1954. In her book, Thelma Smith does not detail what that problem was. Need for two additional classrooms in this school was cited in 1954. The Johnson heirs property adjoining the school was purchased for $6,000 in 1959 and old home on that lot was razed for playground space. The playground survives today although the school burned in 1974.

In 1954 at the high school, heat was piped to the agriculture building from the gymnasium. An intercommunication system for the RHS was installed in January 1954.

After Thelma Smith published her history of Robersonville schools in 1959, Outterbridge Grammar School, located on Academy Street in the block between N. Outerbridge Street and Roberson Street, was renamed Robersonville Elementary School.

In 1970–71, the East End School was integrated with Robersonville High School. East End School, consisting of grades 4–8, became East End Middle School with N.W. Slade, principal, and Norman Moore, assistant principal. In 1971–72, Charles Coward was principal and B.S. Courtney was assistant principal.

When Robersonville Elementary School burned down in 1974, two new hallways with 10 classrooms and a library were added to East End to house grades K-3. After the burned school was demolished, the town built a little league baseball park, tennis court, and playground on the property between N. Outerbridge Street and Roberson Street. When Roanoke High School opened in 1975, Robersonville High School became the Junior High for grades 6–8. Later the school was known as Robersonville Middle School until it closed in December 2000. Roanoke Middle School opened in January 2001. The old RHS gymnasium is now being used for flea market type activities.

The black community has preserved the old East End School as a historical landmark and now calls it the W.C. Chance Alumni Cultural Center. The national W. C. Chance-East End Alumni Association was formed in 1985. The organization also has an after-school program, summer camp, and scholarship fund. The outreach program has placed the W. C. Chance-East End Alumni / Cultural Center as the cornerstone of the New Town Community and is committed to developing educational programs. It also hosts several events throughout the year, such as a Kwanzaa celebration, community meetings, art exhibits, church events, wedding receptions and family reunions.

<text>Williamston is a town and the county seat of Martin County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 5,248 at the 2020 census. It is located in North Carolina&#x27;s Inner Banks region. The closest major city is Greenville, approximately to the southwest.

==History==
Williamston was founded in 1779, and named after Williams William, a local military commander during the American Revolution.

Williamston was the focus of activity in the Civil Rights Movement. Beginning in June 1963, civil rights activists protested at City Hall for 29 consecutive days led by Golden Frinks. The Ku Klux Klan was very active in this part of the state during this time, including a well-documented rally in Williamston on October 5, 1963, attended by mostly local residents but with several carloads of attendees traveling over 150 miles to attend.

On August 3, 2023, Martin General Hospital in Williamston announced that it would suspend operations due to Quorum Health, which operated the hospital, filing for bankruptcy. The hospital said that it faced challenges due to a declining population and residents opting to go to other hospitals. The next day, former hospital employees organized a protest after its closure. They said the goal was to get the attention of an elected official in hopes they would rethink the decision of the hospital being shut down. On August 14–15, Governor Roy Cooper visited Williamston to hold roundtable discussions about the lack of access of medical care in rural areas. He used the recent closure of the hospital as an example of why he supported expanding Medicaid across rural areas of North Carolina. On October 5, four clinics in Williamston also closed, further adding to the current healthcare crisis in the town.

==History==

Marion, the county seat of McDowell County, was planned and built on land selected by the first McDowell County Commissioners on March 14, 1844 at the Historic Carson House on Buck Creek. It was not until 1845, however, that the official name of Marion was sanctioned as the county seat by the state legislature. The name of Marion came from Brigadier General Francis Marion, the American Revolutionary War hero, known as the &quot;Swamp Fox&quot; and the man upon whom the movie &quot;The Patriot&quot; was based. Marion was also home to Sgt. Daniel Kanipe, one of only two survivors of the Battle of Little Bighorn. An historical marker was placed in front of his former home in 2011. The nearby Lake James is a local tourist attraction, and has been the backdrop for movies such as &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; and &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;.

Another famous house in Marion is the Joseph McDowell House, built in 1787 by the county&#x27;s namesake, Joseph McDowell. McDowell played a large role in the Battle of Cowpens when he helped defeat the British in January 1781. McDowell went on to serve as a member of the North Carolina Constitutional Convention in 1788 and was a member of the 3rd United States Congress. Restoration plans are underway to preserve this historic house and ensure that it remains a vital part of Marion&#x27;s history. In 2010, the Joseph McDowell Greenway opened to the public along the Catawba River, and will soon link the two most historic homes in McDowell County, the Joseph McDowell House and the Carson House.

The Big Fire

Until the late 19th century, Main Street was a collection of mostly wooden huts, houses, and buildings. On Sunday morning, November 25, 1894 a fire sprang up in an old building known as the &quot;Ark&quot; located behind the Courthouse. The fire spread to Main Street and rushed down the street at an incredible pace. The wooden buildings were quickly consumed by the enormous inferno. The few brick buildings on Main Street were also gutted, and because there was no public water supply, bucket brigades were hurriedly formed to halt the advance of the fire. It was not enough, however, and most of Main Street was burned to the ground. Showing the resiliency possessed by the citizens, the city came together and took on the rebuilding process, making Marion larger and stronger than before. Today, downtown Marion is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Depression Era &amp; Labor Conflict

On Oct. 2, 1929, the McDowell County sheriff and several deputies faced a group of workers outside the fence in front of the Marion Manufacturing Company, whose 600 employees had been on strike for four months. A gunfight quickly ensued between the two groups. Sheriff Oscar Adkins would later swear in court that the strikers opened fire first, although no weapons were ever found on any of the strikers. 36 strikers were shot, six mortally, during the confrontation. Sinclair Lewis wrote a syndicated newspaper report entitled &quot;Cheap and Contented Labor: The Picture of the Southern Mill Town.&quot; He concluded: &quot;The workers, especially in Marion, have become discouraged. They are hungry, tired, bewildered. They are sick of being shot down. Unless the whole country encourages them [financially], they will crawl back into the slavery I have sought to picture here.&quot; However, since the Great Depression was in the immediate future, little such help would arrive.

Historic District

Eleven structures make up the Main Street Historic District in the downtown area, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Four churches, St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church (1882), First Baptist (1914), First Presbyterian (1923), and St. Matthew&#x27;s Lutheran Church (1935); two former hotels, the Eagle Hotel, which survived the 1894 fire, and the Hotel Marianna (1910); a bank on Main Street built in 1903; the McDowell County Courthouse, which was constructed in 1928; the Marion Depot (1867), which is the oldest surviving depot on the Western Rail Line; the Public Library (1937), which was originally built as a post office; and the Marion Community Building, built in 1937. Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places are the Depot Historic District, Carson House, Carson–Young House, and Lone Beech.
Downtown Marion has benefited from recent revitalization, and many new shops, restaurants, and taprooms have opened up along Main Street in recent years.

Marion Today

Marion currently stands as a small congenial town at the edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains, &quot;Where Main Street Meets the Mountains.&quot; Just off Interstate 40, Marion is located approximately east of Asheville and west of Morganton.

Marion was named &quot;North Carolina Small Town of the Year&quot; for 2018 from the N.C. Rural Center. The Small Town of the Year Award recognizes a town or small city “that embraces citizen engagement, values diversity, and fosters strong partnerships.”

Marion serves as a gateway from Interstate 40 to many nearby attractions and recreation activities in the Blue Ridge Mountains. A contemporary rest area located on the US 221 bypass west of Marion serves as a welcome center for visitors to the area. The rest area and visitor center is staffed with travel counselors during daylight hours. In addition to providing visitor information, it also has picnic facilities and vending machines on the premises.

The Marion Marauders, a Tar Heel League baseball club, were a favorite local attraction in the 1940s and 1950s, and were the home team of star pitcher Kelly Jack Swift, who in 1953 became the last minor league pitcher to ever win 30 games in a season, going 30–7 with a 2.54 ERA. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; published an article about Swift and his accomplishment in its October 17, 2011 edition.

Former University of North Carolina Tar Heels basketball coach and 2007 Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Roy Williams was born and spent a part of his childhood in Marion. On July 18, 2011, the town held a ceremony to dedicate a Carolina blue historical marker downtown in front of City Hall, listing Marion as the birthplace of Coach Williams, as well as his many awards and accomplishments.

Marion continues to be a community that values athletics, especially the &quot;Fightin&#x27; Titans&quot; of McDowell High, whose girls&#x27; basketball team won the 1992 North Carolina 4A State Championship. 

McDowell County and the City of Marion is protected by the Marion Police Department as well as the McDowell County Sheriffs Office. 

Marion’s current Police Chief is Allen Lawrence, while the McDowell County Sheriff is Ricky Buchanan. 

The Marion Fire department Provides fire protection and a Medium level rescue response throughout its district while also receiving assistance from outlying volunteer department mutual aid responses within as well as outside the county. 

The McDowell County Rescue Squad and Ambulance Inc provides rescue services both to the city of Marion and the county as a whole while McDowell County EMS provides paramedic level EMS coverage.

==Education==
McDowell Technical Community College is located here.

Grades Kindergarten through the 5th grade are available to students typically based geographically as to where they reside in the county. Those elementary schools are:
Glenwood, Marion, Nebo, North Cove, Pleasant Gardens, Old Fort, Eastfield and West Marion. 

The county is also host to two middle schools which are funneled into by the elementary schools. The two middle schools are East McDowell Middle School and West McDowell Middle School, hosting 6th-8th Grade. 

Upon completion of the 8th Grade, students have the opportunity of attending McDowell High School or choosing between the McDowell Academy for Innovation or the McDowell Early College. Both of which are hosted by McDowell Technical Community College.

==Attractions==

The city operates three parks in Marion, the main one being downtown beside the Community Building. In 2010, the City opened the Joseph McDowell Historical Catawba Greenway. Named in honor of the county&#x27;s namesake, Colonel Joseph McDowell, the greenway follows the flow of the Catawba River. Benches, picnic tables, fitness stations, fishing piers, and a canoe launch are scattered throughout the three-mile trail. Access points are located at Highway 70 between Highway 221/226 By-Pass and Roby Conley Road, as well as a parking lot at the opposite end behind the Joseph McDowell House. 

Historic homes such as the Carson House and the Joseph McDowell House have been preserved to keep the history of Marion alive for decades. They have been open weekdays to the public, but the McDowell House is closed during restoration. 

In downtown Marion, the restored Marion Depot, the oldest surviving depot on the Western Rail Line, hosts a number of community events each month, and is available for rental to individuals and groups for meetings, receptions, parties, and other functions. Several golf courses are located outside town, in addition to two waterparks and numerous campgrounds.

Downtown Marion’s most recent change has been the renovation of the Former West Rock plant into a community business complex which plays host to a municipal events center, several business including Barbershops, Martial Arts Schools and tasty restaurants such as the Marion Wing Factory and Burrito Bro’s. In 2023 the Miller Complex hosted famous musician Oliver Anthony who became widely known for his song “Rich Men North of Richmond”

Nearby Lake James provides fishing, camping, and recreation for residents of McDowell and Burke counties. Lake Tahoma, Linville Caverns, Linville Falls, Catawba Falls, and the Blue Ridge Parkway are also close to town, and exhibit the diverse scenery of Western North Carolina.

Before the arrival of European settlers, the area that is now Old Fort was populated by the Catawba and Cherokee. In the 1500s, Spanish explorers came through the area. English and Scottish settlers arrived in the area in the mid-1700s.

During the Revolutionary War, a stockade or fort was constructed on land owned by brothers George and Samuel Davidson, &quot;the westernmost outpost of Colonial civilization&quot; It was called Davidson&#x27;s Fort and was the post for military expeditions such as that of Gen. Griffith Rutherford in 1776. The fort became a site for trading between settlers and Native Americans.

The arrival of the Western North Carolina Railway (WNCR) in 1869 stimulated the development of a depot and hotel. In 1871, Sanborn Worthen bought the 2200-acre Old Fort Plantation from George Davidson&#x27;s grandson and changed its name to Catawba Vale. Worth hoped the railroad would build its yard there but the WNCR chose another site.

On January 25, 1872, the town of Catawba Vale was founded. The town name was changed to Old Fort on February 23, 1873, honoring its origins. The railroad came to Old Fort in 1879.

In the 1950s the Supreme Court of North Carolina dismissed a case brought by students attempting to attend the all-white school in Old Fort. They were told to attend Hudgins High School, a school for blacks, 12 miles away in Marion, North Carolina. 

In 1984, the town began free weekly mountain music concerts, held in the historic Rockett Building each Friday night downtown. They attracted large audiences and numerous musicians. In mid-2014, the organization that ran mountain music lost its arrangement with the building owner, and the weekly music shows ended after 27 years.

<text>Bakersville is a town in Mitchell County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 464 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Mitchell County.

==History==
In prehistoric times, local mica deposits were extensively mined by Native Americans. The first Euro-American settlers arrived in the area after the American Revolution, establishing scattered homesteads. The town of Bakersville dates from the 1850s and was named for David Baker, a Revolutionary War soldier and one of the first to live in the area around 1790 and described as &quot;a large land owner, innkeeper, merchant and political leader until his death in 1838. Some of David&#x27;s sons and daughters remained and were equally influential in the area for many years after David&#x27;s death. &quot; Situated on the main route leading over Roan Mountain and westward into Tennessee, the town developed slowly. Traveler Frederick Law Olmsted passed through Bakersville in the early 1850s and noted that the &quot;town&quot; consisted of only a couple of cabins within a quarter-mile radius. In 1861, a post office was established and named Davis after Jefferson Davis. Following the Civil War, the county seat of newly created Mitchell County was relocated to the town that had been renamed Bakersville by the Republican state government, leading to the construction of a courthouse and a growth in population. In the 1870s, as mica became commercially valuable, the rich local deposits of the mineral caused a temporary economic boom. Bakersville is also home to the North Carolina Rhododendron Festival. The pageant attracts visitors from across the state and nation, most notably Richard Nixon in 1968.

Historian and sociologist James W. Loewen has identified Bakersville as one of several possible sundown towns in North Carolina.

The Mitchell County Courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

<text>Spruce Pine is the largest town in Mitchell County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 2,175 at the 2010 census. It is one of the only places in the world where high-purity quartz can be found.

==History==
Spruce Pine was founded in 1907, when the Clinchfield Railroad made its way up the North Toe River from Erwin, Tennessee. The town was originally centered around a tavern operated by Isaac English, which was located on an old roadway that ran from Cranberry, North Carolina, down to Marion, NC. The Old English Inn still stands at its original location near the center of town. In 1923, after an African-American escaped convict allegedly raped a local white resident, a large armed white mob rounded up scores of black men who were laboring on a road construction project and forced them to leave town on boxcars. North Carolina Governor Cameron Morrison deployed National Guard troops to Spruce Pine so that the workers could return and complete the road.

The railroad, combined with a rapidly expanding mining industry (the town is the namesake of the famous Spruce Pine Mining District) made Spruce Pine the largest town in the Toe River Valley, as it became the hub of commerce and culture for the area. Spruce Pine was the home of The Feldspar Company and Spruce Pine Mica, and other major mining interests had operations in and around the town.

With the decline in use of railroads to ship goods, along with increasing automation in the mining industry, the town recently has seen its fortunes dwindle and has undertaken a major effort to reinvent itself. Tourism has become a major economic force in the region, and the town&#x27;s proximity to the Blue Ridge Parkway, combined with its location near the edge of the Blue Ridge Escarpment, has helped make Spruce Pine a travel destination for many. The town also boasts the moniker of &quot;The Mineral City of the World&quot;.

On August 4, 2007, the downtown area of Spruce Pine was threatened when an arsonist set fire to several buildings downtown. The fires, which brought firemen from four counties around Spruce Pine, severely damaged the building that housed Cheapskates Music on Lower Street and caused some tense moments when it seemed that the fires might spread out of control and consume the downtown area.

The Downtown Spruce Pine Historic District and Gunter Building are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Spruce Pine is the exclusive supplier of sand to Augusta National Golf Club.

The town suffered flooding and devastation as a result of Hurricane Helene in 2024.

Spruce Pine has high-purity quartz, a mineral required in a variety of important products, such as semiconductors. View the Spruce Pine Mining District article for further information.

==History==
===Ancient history===
This region was occupied by the Pee Dee culture, part of the Southern Appalachian Mississippian culture, from about 980 to 1150 CE. They built the earthwork platform mound and other structures at Town Creek Indian Mound, which has been designated a National Historic Landmark since 1966. It is the only Native American site in the state to be designated as a national landmark. In the 21st century, the Pee Dee are based in South Carolina, where the state has recognized several bands as tribes.

===European-American settlement===
Mount Gilead was incorporated in 1899 as the textile industry built mills in the Piedmont section of the state above the fall line of rivers. They processed the commodity crop of cotton, which had been important to the South since before the Civil War. The textile mills provided jobs to white residents of the region, later also employing blacks and supporting relative prosperity in the region.

Since the late 20th century, many textile jobs moved offshore in a restructuring of the industry as it sought lower labor costs. Like many small southern towns, Mount Gilead suffered economic and population decline following the loss of these textile jobs.

===Historic District and sites===
The town has begun to emphasize the appeal of its historic resources. Its Historic District has been inventoried and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Mount Gilead was selected to participate in the N.C. Small Town Main Street Program (co-sponsored by the National Trust for Historic Preservation) and received a S.T.E.P. (Small Town Economic Prosperity) grant of $220,000 to help revitalize the downtown area and create jobs, respectively.

The Mount Gilead Museum is located in a restored Victorian house near the downtown area. The house belonged to the McAulay family, who played an important role in Mount Gilead business, church, social, and civic life. The museum houses many documents, photographs, and historic artifacts that tell the story of Mount Gilead&#x27;s past.

Downtown Mount Gilead is also a host for a Moon Tree at the Mount Gilead Community Garden. The Moon Tree was planted on June 3, 2024, by Mary Poplin and her daughter as part of a special community ceremony. This historic tree, a loblolly pine, is one of a select few grown from seeds that orbited the moon aboard NASA&#x27;s Artemis I mission in 2022. Now thriving in the town’s Gathering Garden, Mount Gilead&#x27;s Moon Tree is a living reminder of humanity’s curiosity, perseverance, and desire to reach for the stars.

==Notable people from Mount Gilead==
The Haywood plantation house where Oscar Haywood lived is in Mount Gilead. He is buried in Sharon Cemetery in the town.

Mount Gilead is the birthplace of civil rights attorney Julius L. Chambers (b. 1936). A graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (J.D., 1962), Chambers served as editor-in-chief of the school&#x27;s &quot;Law Review&quot;. He next earned a master of law degree from New York&#x27;s Columbia University in 1964.

==Arts==
The Piedmont Center of the Arts and The Ford Place Restaurant, Pub &amp; Special Events Center were developed with funding from the North Carolina Rural Center. The arts facility houses a wood-turner who gives lessons, the office of the Mount Gilead Arts Guild, a retail co-op store, and a clock repair shop. The restaurant is based in an adapted Ford dealership. Customers see much of the town&#x27;s history preserved on the walls and under glass on the tables.

Mount Gilead has a number of visual and performing artists who routinely show their work at the arts complex.

The Mount Gilead Community Concerts Association (MGCCA) is a non-profit organization presenting a program of diverse performing arts to the local area. Incorporated in 2001, the organization presents an annual Concert Series featuring visiting musicians. When possible, these artists present a program for local school students. MGCCA is governed by a volunteer board of directors and supported through the contributions of local individuals and companies.

The Mount Gilead Community Choir has produced annual concerts since its founding in 1995. This group of volunteer singers traditionally presents a Christmas concert on the first Sunday in December. The choir is supported in part by the Mount Gilead Community Concerts Association (MGCCA), and more information can be found of the organization&#x27;s website.

Community Radio WMTG-LP (88.1 FM) is a non-commercial, low-power station that serves the town by airing announcements of local interest. The station programs a mix of oldies and adult contemporary music and broadcasts 24 hours a day. WMTG is a service of the Mount Gilead Community Concerts Association (MGCCA).

==History==

The town of Star was incorporated in 1897. It was originally called Hunsucker&#x27;s Store, after a trading post operated by the original landowner, Mr. Martin Hunsucker. After the Civil War, a man named Angus Leach moved to Hunsucker&#x27;s Store and helped to found the present Town of Star, serving as postmaster, hotel operator, and general merchandise store owner. Gold was discovered in the area around 1866, and by 1874 there were extensive gold mining operations in this part of the state, particularly around the Little River area of Star. When the Aberdeen and West End Railroad (owned by the Page family of Aberdeen, NC), completed a branch to Star from Filo, NC (Biscoe, North Carolina) in 1895, it was only a short period later before Star was incorporated into a town. 
Star was a major shipping point for lumber, turpentine, and bricks beginning in 1896 with the completion of the Asheboro and Montgomery Railroad, also built by the Page family. In 1896, the Leach Family erected a large wooden hotel to accommodate the travelers and workers of the railroad, and the hotel (The Star Hotel Bed and Breakfast) is still standing today and is owned by Gary Spivey. In 1897, the Aberdeen and West End Railroad merged with the Asheboro and Montgomery Railroad to form the Aberdeen and Asheboro Railroad, thus opening the area to a whole new range of shipping. The timber industry was the first major factor in the growth of Star. The Star Lumber Company, headed by Z.T. Wright, J.B. Shamburger, and W.T. Harper, had built a tramway in 1896 to haul logs to the mills in town. The tramway was removed in 1901 when the Durham and Charlotte Railroad was built to Star. The Durham and Charlotte Railroad was to connect the two cities of Durham and Charlotte. Because The town of Star was the junction and crossroads for the Aberdeen &amp; Asheboro Railroad and the Durham &amp; Charlotte Railroad, business in the town began to pick up.

Sometime around 1900, a bottling plant was established in Star by J.R. Ingrahm to bottle sodas for the area. This company preceded the Coca-Cola Plant in Star, which was later moved to Biscoe, North Carolina. Also in 1900, the Montgomery Roller Mill was incorporated with a capital stock of $4700 by Braxton Auman, who also operated a whiskey distillery and chair factory. In 1907, Star&#x27;s first undertaker, Mr. H.D. Phillips, established a funeral parlor. This was the beginning of a long and successful business for the Phillips family who still operate the Phillips Funeral Home today. Interesting to note was the organization of a &quot;Carolina Collegiate and Agricultural Institute&quot; around 1910 in Star by Dr. Edward F. Green that cooperated with the North Carolina A &amp; M College in Raleigh. The town saw massive growth between the years of 1912 and 1950 when the Norfolk Southern Railway (former) purchased the old lines of the Aberdeen and Asheboro Railroad and the Durham and Charlotte Railroad. The operation held a depot, water tank, and coal chute in Star. This new era saw the introduction of the hosiery mill industry, a boom in lumber production, various new stores and products, and a huge surge in population. In 1914–1915, Boy Scout Troop 111 was established in Star, one of the earliest in North Carolina. Since that point, the town continued to slowly grow into a prosperous community. In the 1960s the town undertook the task of erecting some of the first public housing units in the state. On March 14, 1969, Lancer Inc., one of the nation&#x27;s Top 50 upholstered furniture manufacturers, started its operations in Star and continues to be one of Star&#x27;s largest employers, having expanded its operations six times.
Since then, the hosiery mills experienced a decline and eventually left Star. This left hundreds unemployed and the once prosperous town of Star began to wither away. The buildings that once employed many now mostly sit empty. In September 2013, downtown Star was honored by being listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Star Historic District.

===Star today===
Star has been designated as a U.S. Postal Service Christmas Town. The Star Christmas Parade is documented as one of the oldest in the State, as well as the longest with the most entries. Central Park NC has its current headquarters in the old Country Life Academy building in Star, now known as STARworks Center for Creative Enterprise. STARworks hosts several annual events including the Annual Glass Pumpkin Patch and FireFest: Community Fueled Art. The town is located at the center of the state of North Carolina. Local and nearby attractions include Uwharrie National Forest, Badin Lake, Lake Tillery, North Carolina Zoo, and Pinehurst.

<text>Aberdeen is a town in Moore County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 8,516 at the 2020 Census.

==History==
Scottish emigrants were the first Europeans to settle the area beginning in 1745. They were drawn to the area by bountiful hunting and virgin land, and they founded the communities of Bethesda and Blue&#x27;s Crossing by the late 18th Century.

During the American Revolution, the people of what is now Aberdeen were generally Loyalists. There were a few small skirmishes in the vicinity of Aberdeen, most notably the one at Ray&#x27;s Mill Creek, in which Colonel Philip Alston of the House in the Horseshoe, who was in pursuit of Loyalist Colonel David Fanning, savagely beat Kenneth Black, a local who had acted as Fanning&#x27;s guide through the area.

One of the earliest industries of Bethesda and Blue&#x27;s Crossing was naval stores due to the abundance of pine trees in the area. These goods were transported to market initially via the Cape Fear River to Wilmington, and later by plank road.

Over 1,500 residents of what is now Aberdeen participated in the Civil War. Nearly one-third of the soldiers sent were killed, which decimated the labor supply. After the Civil War, however, the Raleigh and Augusta Air Line Railroad connected the community of Blue&#x27;s Crossing to the rest of the country, allowing them to sell their naval stores and timber to the rest of the country.

In 1877, a post office was established and Malcolm J. Blue was appointed postmaster. Four years later, Allison F. Page bought numerous forested acres to build a rail line, as well as to clear the land for timber. This land was later sold to James Walker Tufts for $1 an acre, and later became home of the historic golf resort, Pinehurst Resort. Blue&#x27;s Crossing&#x27;s name was officially changed to the present Aberdeen in 1888.

In the early twentieth century, tobacco farming came to the town. Aberdeen&#x27;s proximity to Pinehurst resulted in a boom in the tourism and retirement industries, which remain a major part of the local economy today.

The Aberdeen Historic District, Bethesda Presbyterian Church, John Blue House, and Malcolm Blue Farm are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="128056" wikidata="Q1993002" url="?curid=128056" title="Carthage, North Carolina">
<text>Carthage is the county seat of Moore County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 2,635 at the 2020 census. The city is named after Carthage.

==History==

The town was the home of the Tyson &amp; Jones Buggy Company, a predominant cart and buggy manufacturer in the late 1800s. A common local story is that after the closing of the Tyson Buggy Company, Henry Ford was interested in buying the old plant and converting it into a car assembly line. According to the legend, the owners refused to let Ford buy the plant. He moved on and built his first plant in Detroit, making it the center of auto manufacturing. This story is often repeated despite a lack of evidence, and it runs contrary to the life of Ford, who was born and raised in Detroit and started his businesses there. A few years after being closed, the former Tyson Buggy plant burned down.

Another common local story is that the town was originally selected as the site for the University of North Carolina. Supposedly, city leaders did not want the university built there. City leaders purportedly told the State that Carthage was on too steep of a hill for locomotives to climb and that access to the university would be limited if built there. This often-repeated story does not account for the fact that locomotives were not invented until two decades after the university had been built in Chapel Hill.

The town has an annual event in spring called the Buggy Festival. This event is used to showcase the history of the town and features music, hot rods, old tractors, old buggies made by the Tyson Buggy Company, and crafts from potteries in the surrounding areas. The festival is held in the town square around the Old Court House, recognized as a historic landmark.

Tyson &amp; Jones buggy factory partner, William T. Jones was born the son of a slave and her white owner in 1833. By the time of his death in 1910, William T. Jones was one of the prominent business owners in Carthage. He rubbed elbows with the elite, white, upper class in Moore County during the 1880s, dined with them, threw elaborate holiday parties where most of the guests were white, and even attended church with them. Both of his wives, Sophia Isabella McLean and Florence Dockery were white. Dockery was the daughter of a well-to-do Apex family.

James Rogers McConnell, a resident of Carthage (March 14, 1887 – March 19, 1917) flew as an aviator during World War I in the Lafayette Escadrille and authored &quot;Flying for France&quot;. He was the first of sixty-four University of Virginia students to die in battle during that War.[1]
McConnell was flying in the area of St.-Quentin when two German planes shot him down on March 19, 1917. He was the last American pilot of the squadron to die under French colors before America entered the war in April 1917. Both the plane and his body were found by the French, and he was buried at the site of his death at the edge of the village of Jussy, and was later reinterred at the Lafayette Escadrille memorial near Paris upon his father&#x27;s wishes. McConnell was commemorated with a plaque by the French Government and a statue by Gutzon Borglum at the University of Virginia, as well as an obelisk on the court square of his home town of Carthage, North Carolina.

The J.F. Cole House in the Carthage Historic District, J.C. Black House, Daniel Blue House, Bruce-Dowd-Kennedy House, Carthage Historic District, Alexander Kelly House, and Moore County Courthouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Pinehurst, known formally as The Village of Pinehurst, is a village in Moore County, North Carolina, United States. As of the 2020 census, the village population was 17,581. Pinehurst refers to both the village, and the Pinehurst Resort, a Golf resort, which has hosted multiple United States Open Championships in the sport. A large portion of the central village, including the resort complexes, is a National Historic Landmark District, designated in 1996 for its landscape design by Frederick Law Olmsted and its significance in the history of golf in the United States. Pinehurst has been designated as the &quot;Home of American Golf&quot; by the United States Golf Association and by the State of North Carolina. The surrounding area is known for its strong equestrian community, including the former Stoneybrook Steeplechase, and the current Pinehurst Harness Track. Fox hunting is also a common sport in the area.

The Pinehurst Resort is one of three designated anchor sites for the men&#x27;s US Open in Golf. Since 1999, the resort has hosted the event four times, most recently in 2024. The US Open will return to Pinehurst in 2029, 2035, 2041, and 2047.

Golf House Pinehurst, which opened in 2024, hosts the World Golf Hall of Fame.

In addition to the Pinehurst Resort, the village is home to The Country Club of North Carolina. In the immediate area surrounding Pinehurst, there are more than 40 other golf courses, including the Pine Needles Lodge and Golf Club in the adjacent town of Southern Pines, which itself has hosted the U.S. Open tournament in Women&#x27;s Golf an additional four times.

For several years in the late 2010&#x27;s-early 2020&#x27;s, the Pinehurst-Southern Pines area was continuously ranked by POLICOM as the best micropolitan area to live in North Carolina, and a top ten micropolitan area nationwide. Contributing factors included the quality of local amenities, as well as the strong medical and golf tourism industries. As of July 2023, Pinehurst and Southern Pines were re-designated as the Pinehurst-Southern Pines Metropolitan Statistical Area by the Office of Management and Budget, with a combined population that had reached above 50,000 residents.

==History==
In 1895, James Walker Tufts purchased 500 acres (200 ha), and eventually purchased an additional 5,500 acres (2,200 ha), of land for approximately $1.25 per acre in the North Carolina Sandhills, with the vision of building a &quot;health resort for people of modest means&quot;. Tufts retained Frederick Law Olmsted to design the village, which features curving lanes and a picturesque central green.

Originally a health retreat titled Tuftstown and also Pinealia during construction stages in 1895, it expanded and was renamed the village of Pinehurst by December of that year. The name was suggested in a public contest to name a new development in Martha&#x27;s Vineyard; as it was not selected, Tufts decided to re-appropriate the name for use at his new development in the South. The village saw its first guests in January 1896. 

The first golf course at Pinehurst Resort was laid out in 1897–1898. The first championship held at Pinehurst was the United North and South Amateur Championship of 1901. The best known course, Pinehurst No. 2, was designed by Donald Ross and completed in 1907. Pinehurst Race Track was established in 1915. In 1980, the village became a municipality. The resort now has ten golf courses, three hotels, a health spa, and extensive sports and leisure facilities.

In 1999, National Public Radio reported that many local business owners in Pinehurst were upset because the Pinehurst Resort was using lawsuits to prevent local businesses from using the term &quot;Pinehurst&quot; in the names of their businesses. The village council sought a written guarantee from the Pinehurst Resort that it would not force any business in the village to remove the name &quot;Pinehurst&quot; from its name unless the business is a direct competitor. The request came a week later in a local newspaper. The village also sued the resort over control of the name shared between the resort and village. In the quarter century of growth since, the relationship between the Village and the Resort has been amicable and mutually beneficial. As the village and resort are geographically intertwined, it is permissible to operate a registered golf cart on public roads throughout the village.

The Lloyd-Howe House, Pinehurst Historic District and Pinehurst Race Track are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
The village has a total area of 17.2 square miles (44.5 km), of which 16.6 square miles (43 km) is land and 0.6 square mile (1.5 km) (3.37%) is water.

Three streams, Aberdeen Creek, Horse Creek, and Joes Fork, have their headwaters in the Pinehurst area.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 17,581 people, 7,301 households, and 4,991 families residing in the village. The median income for a household in the village was $92,342, and the median income for a family was $108,433. About 2.2% of families were below the poverty line.

<text>Robbins is a city in Moore County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 1,097 at the 2010 census.

== History ==


The town, now known as Robbins, actually began in 1795 when gunsmith Alexander Kennedy and his family left Philadelphia to settle along Bear Creek. Kennedy set up a factory, which produced long rifles for American soldiers, near the site of the present day Robbins Water Plant. The Kennedy Rifle Works continued in operation until 1838 and the place became known as Mechanics Hill.

In 1891, the Durham and Charlotte Railroad connected Gulf in Chatham County to Troy in Montgomery County. The railroad reached Mechanics Hill around 1899. Railroad construction added many jobs and greatly increased the number of settlers. The railroad not only created its own jobs, it generated commerce by providing a ready means of transportation for turpentine, talc, pottery, lumber, agricultural products, and passengers. John B. Lennig was president and owner of the company (frequently misspelled as Lenning). Lennig&#x27;s tenure with the company was off-and-on for about 12 years. During that time, town lots and streets were designed. A map was registered at the Moore County Register of Deeds Office on March 24, 1900, and the town was named Elise (pronounced alise), in honor of Lennig&#x27;s daughter.

In 1896, the John L. Frye Company, a producer of lumber for the rail and pallet industries, was established. Railroads across the US are supported by cross ties made in Robbins. John Lennig Frye, a past mayor, was named after John B. Lennig, the railroad owner.

Education was a major concern for the citizens of Elise and the surrounding communities. Some local businessmen and Lennig met many times to discuss these concerns. These meetings resulted in the founding of Elise Academy in 1904. The academy had a very proud standing and children from the town, and from other states and countries, made up the first class. Elise Academy operated until 1940, when it was sold to the Moore County Board of Education. In 1940, Kennedy Funeral Home bought the Arrowhead Dormitory to use as the primary funeral location for the town. It is still used for that purpose today in the center of town.

In 1890, the inventor Thomas Edison visited the town to take option on gold mining interests in the Carter&#x27;s Mill area. Between 1923 and 1924, generators were installed at Carter&#x27;s Mill, along Bear Creek, adjacent to Elise, and the first power was supplied to this area. In 1924 and 1925, William Cowgill built the first textile plant here, operating it as Moore Mills Textiles Plant. Three different companies operated that mill until September 1930, when Karl Robbins (1892-1960), a Russian-American manufacturer and philanthropist, purchased the mill and renamed it Pinehurst Silk Mills.

In 1935, the town&#x27;s name was changed again. The name was changed to Hemp, to avoid confusion between Elise and another town in North Carolina that had a similar name. For a while, the train depot had Elise on the track side and Hemp over the mail room side.

Karl Robbins brought great prominence to Hemp. He was responsible for a modern water treatment plant and a wastewater disposal system being completed in 1937. He also provided for recreational facilities, dial telephone service, a new firetruck, and a baseball park. Robbins started a non profit, Pinelands, and gave or loaned the first $400,000 for Research Triangle Park to be started just outside of Raleigh, North Carolina at the request of Governor Luther Hodges, who was a close personal friend of Mayor W.P. Saunders.

In honor of Karl Robbins, the citizens of Hemp changed the name of the town to Robbins. The name of the town officially became Robbins in 1943, by act of the North Carolina General Assembly.

Later industries included a poultry processing plant, a mobile home manufacturing plant, and several textile mills. Ithaca Industries was a textile manufacturer that produced women&#x27;s hosiery. At the height of its operation, the plant employed 1,100 people.

Robbins, like other rural towns in the South, suffered a loss to its manufacturing base that escalated during the 1990s. According to the Employment Security Commission, Robbins has lost 1,447 jobs since 1990. With the loss of jobs and manufacturing, the town lost a large portion of its water and sewer customers.

<text>Vass is a town in Moore County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 952 at the 2020 census. Vass grew up along the railroad in the late 19th century. It was originally named Bynum and later Winder before being established as Vass in 1892. The town was incorporated in 1907.

==History==

Vass originated as a stop on the Seaboard Railway as a station called Bynum. It was primarily a place with a siding to load lumber, turpentine and resin from the local area. In 1877, the town&#x27;s name was changed from Bynum to Winder, in honor of Major John C. Winder general manager of the Seaboard Railroad. In 1892 its name was again changed to Vass, honoring Major William Worrell Vass, who was at that time paymaster for the Seaboard Railroad. Vass remained as only a stopping place for the local train until 1907, when it was incorporated with Mr. Alex Gunter as mayor. During the 1910s the town took on new life and through the efforts of some great men, like Mr. Angus Cameron, and the town began to grow into a thriving community.

Angus Cameron, who arrived in the settlement in the 1870s from his home in Harnett County and remained until his death in 1928 is acknowledged as the community&#x27;s leading benefactor. He was on the first road commission, and was able to accomplish much in the way of better roads; he served on the Board of County Commissioners and years later, as mayor of Vass. He was on the local school board for around half a century and built the first school building. Cameron erected the first brick buildings in Vass; he organized the Vass Cotton Mill Company and put up the mill building.

The Leslie-Taylor House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Several other structures are eligible for the National Historic Register including: the Borst House, the Angus Cameron House, the John Cameron House, the Walter Graham House, the Vass Commercial Historic District, the Vass Cotton Mill, the Village Historic and the Walter Leslie House.

<text>Castle Hayne is a census-designated place (CDP) in New Hanover County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 1,202 at the 2010 census, up from 1,116 in 2000. It is part of the Wilmington Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The forest provided the region&#x27;s major industries through the 18th and most of the 19th century: naval stores and lumber fueled the economy both before and after the American Revolution. During the Revolutionary War, the British maintained a garrison at Fort Johnson near Wilmington. After suffering crippling losses at Guilford Court House, the British withdrew all forces back to Fort Johnson and abandoned plans to occupy North Carolina. This prompted the British to attack Yorktown, Virginia instead, which brought an end to the war.

== History ==
The town took its name from the large house of Captain Roger Haynes.

Leading up to the 2011 election, there was a large movement among the residents to incorporate Castle Hayne to become the &quot;Town of Castle Hayne&quot;. Nearby Wilmington had previously forced an annexation of Monkey Junction in 2010 and proposed a forced annexation of Ogden, both of which had resulted in numerous lawsuits and appeals.

The incorporation referendum failed in November 2011.

On the night of July 24–25, 1943, a German U-boat fired at least three shells to attack the Ethyl-Dow Chemical Company plant at Kure&#x27;s Beach (post-war: Kure Beach), but instead hit the Cape Fear River. The plant was the only one on the East Coast producing bromine from seawater for use in aviation gasoline.
 Other historians dispute whether the attack actually occurred, and there is no corroborating physical evidence or logs from the German Navy.

<text>Wilmington is a port city in New Hanover County, North Carolina, United States. With a population of 115,451 as of the 2020 census, it is the eighth-most populous city in the state. The county seat of New Hanover County, it is the principal city of the Wilmington metropolitan area, which includes New Hanover, Brunswick, and Pender counties. As of 2023, the region had an estimated population of 467,337.

Wilmington&#x27;s residential area lies between the Cape Fear River and the Atlantic Ocean, and the city developed as a commercial port in the colonial era. Toward the end of the 19th century, Wilmington was a majority-black, racially integrated, prosperous cityand the largest in North Carolina. It suffered what became known as the Wilmington insurrection of 1898 when white supremacists launched a coup that overthrew the legitimately elected local Fusionist government. It resulted in the expulsion of opposition black and white political leaders from the city, destruction of the property and businesses of black citizens, including the city&#x27;s only black newspaper, and deaths ranging from an estimated 60 to more than 300 people. By 1910, Charlotte overtook Wilmington as North Carolina&#x27;s largest city.

Wilmington&#x27;s downtown includes a riverwalk, developed as a tourist attraction in the late 20th century. In 2003, the city was designated by the U.S. Congress as a &quot;Coast Guard City&quot;, one of 29 cities that currently bear that designation. It was formerly the home port for the , a United States Coast Guard medium-endurance cutter. Wilmington was declared the first World War II Heritage City in the country in 2020. The World War II battleship , now a war memorial, is moored across from the downtown port area, and is open to the public for tours. Other attractions include the Cape Fear Museum of History and Science and the Children&#x27;s Museum of Wilmington.

The city is home to the University of North Carolina Wilmington. Wilmington is also the home of Cinespace Wilmington, the largest domestic television and movie production facility outside California. Dream Stage 10, the facility&#x27;s newest sound stage, is the third-largest in the United States. It houses the largest special-effects water tank in North America. After the studio complex&#x27;s opening in 1984, Wilmington became a major center of American film and television production. Numerous movies and television series—in a range of genres—have been filmed/produced in or near the city, including &quot;The Black Phone&quot;, &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, &quot;The Conjuring&quot;, &quot;The Crow&quot; (1994), &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Eastbound &amp; Down&quot;, &quot;Halloween Kills&quot;, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, &quot;Iron Man 3&quot;, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, &quot;Outer Banks&quot;, &quot;Scream&quot; (2022), &quot;The Summer I Turned Pretty&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;.

==History==
===Colonial beginnings===

The city was founded in the 1730s. After going through a series of different names (New Carthage, New London, Newton), its name became Wilmington. In 1739, Col. William Bartram, the uncle of the naturalist, introduced a bill to establish Wilmington, named for one of his patrons, Spencer Compton, Earl of Wilmington.

The area along the river had been inhabited by various successive cultures of indigenous peoples for thousands of years. At the time of European encounter, historic Native Americans were members of tribes belonging to the Eastern Siouan family.

In the early 16th century, Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, commissioned by the king of France with a French crew, was reportedly the first European to see this area, including the city&#x27;s present site. The first permanent colonial settlement in the area was established in the 1720s by European settlers. In September 1732, a community was founded on land owned by John Watson on the Cape Fear River, at the confluence of its northwest and northeast branches. The settlement, founded by the first royal governor, George Burrington, was called New Carthage, and then New Liverpool; it gradually took on the name New Town or Newton. Governor Gabriel Johnston soon after established his government there for the North Carolina colony.

Some early settlers of Wilmington came from the Albemarle and Pamlico regions, as well as from the colonies of Virginia and South Carolina, but most new settlers migrated from the northern colonies, the West Indies, and Northern Europe. Many of the early settlers were indentured servants from Northern Europe. As the indentured servants gained their freedom and fewer could be persuaded to travel to North America because of improving conditions back home, the settlers imported an increasing number of slaves to satisfy the labor demand. By 1767, African slaves accounted for more than 62% of the population of the Lower Cape Fear region. Many worked in the port as laborers, and some in ship-related trades.

Naval stores and lumber fueled the region&#x27;s economy, both before and after the American Revolution. During the Revolutionary War, the British maintained a garrison at Fort Johnston near Wilmington.

===Revolutionary era===
Due to Wilmington&#x27;s commercial importance as a major port, it had a critical role in opposition to the British in the years leading up to the revolution. The city had outspoken political leaders who influenced and led the resistance movement in North Carolina. The foremost of these was Wilmington resident Cornelius Harnett, who was serving in the General Assembly at the time, and where he rallied opposition to the Sugar Act in 1764. When the British Parliament passed the Stamp Act the following year, designed to raise revenue for the Crown with a kind of tax on shipping, Wilmington was the site of an elaborate demonstration against it.

On October 19, 1765, several hundred townspeople gathered in protest of the new law, burned an effigy of one town resident who favored the act, and toasted to &quot;Liberty, Property, and No Stamp Duty.&quot; On October 31, another crowd gathered in a symbolic funeral of &quot;Liberty&quot;. Before the effigy was buried, though, Liberty was found to have a pulse, and celebration ensued.

William Houston of Duplin County was appointed stamp receiver for Cape Fear. When Houston visited Wilmington on business, still unaware of his appointment, he recounted,

&quot;The Inhabitants immediately assembled about me &amp; demanded a Categorical Answer whether I intended to put the Act relating [to] the Stamps in force. The Town Bell was rung[,] Drums [were] beating, Colours [were] flying and [a] great concourse of People [were] gathered together.&quot; For the sake of his own life, and &quot;to quiet the Minds of the inraged and furious Mobb...,&quot; Houston resigned his position at the courthouse.

Governor William Tryon made attempts to mitigate the opposition, to no avail. On November 18, 1765, he pleaded his case directly to prominent residents of the area. They said the law restricted their rights. When the stamps arrived on November 28 on HMS &quot;Diligence&quot;, Tryon ordered them to be kept on board. Shipping on the Cape Fear River was stopped, as were the functions of the courts.

Tryon, after having received his official commission as governor (a position he had assumed only after the death of Arthur Dobbs), was brought to Wilmington by Captain Constantine Phipps on a barge from the &quot;Diligence&quot;, and &quot;was received cordially by the gentlemen of the borough.&quot; He was greeted with the firing of seventeen pieces of artillery, and the New Hanover County Regiment of the North Carolina militia, who had lined the streets. This &quot;warm welcome&quot; was spoiled, however, after a dispute arose between Captain Phipps and captains of ships in the harbor regarding the display of their colors. The townspeople became infuriated with Phipps and threats were made against both sides. After Tryon harangued them for their actions, the townspeople gathered around the barrels of punch and ox he had brought as refreshments. The barrels were broken open, letting the punch spill into the streets; they threw the head of the ox into the pillory, and gave its body to the enslaved population. Because of the unrest, Tryon moved his seat of government to New Bern instead of Wilmington.

On February 18, 1766, two merchant ships arrived without stamped papers at Brunswick Town. Each ship provided signed statements from the collectors at their respective ports of origin that no were stamps available, but Captain Jacob Lobb of the British cruiser &quot;Viper&quot; seized the vessels. In response, numerous residents from southern counties met in Wilmington. The group organized as the Sons of Liberty and pledged to block implementation of the Stamp Act. The following day, as many as a thousand men, including the mayor and aldermen of Wilmington, were led by Cornelius Harnett to Brunswick to confront Tryon. The governor was unyielding, but a mob retrieved the seized ships. They forced royal customs officers and public officials in the region to swear never to issue stamped paper. The Westminster Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in March 1766.

===Antebellum period===
In the 1830s, citizens of Wilmington became eager to take advantage of railroad transportation. At this time, the shipping tonnage registered at Wilmington was 9,035. Plans were developed to build a railroad line from the capital, Raleigh, to Wilmington. When Raleigh citizens declined to subscribe in sufficient number to stock to raise money for the project, organizers changed the terminus to Weldon. When the railroad line was completed in 1840, it was the longest single line of railroad track in the world. The railroad also controlled a fleet of steamboats that ran between Wilmington and Charleston; these were used both for passenger travel and freight. Regular boat lines served Fayetteville, and packet lines traveled to northern ports. The city was a main stopover point, contributing greatly to its commerce.

By mid-century, the churchyard of St. James Episcopal Church and other town cemeteries had become filled with graves. On November 16, 1853, a group of citizens, organized as &quot;the Proprietors of the Wilmington Cemetery&quot;, was formed to develop a new cemetery. Sixty-five acres of land around Burnt Mill Creek were chosen as the site for what would be called Oakdale Cemetery. It was the first rural cemetery in North Carolina. The cemetery&#x27;s first interment, on February 6, 1855, was six-year-old Annie deRosset. Many remains from St. James churchyard were relocated to the new cemetery.

The Wilmington Gas Light Company was established in 1854. Soon after, streetlights were powered by gas made from lightwood and rosin, replacing the old street oil lamps. On December 27, 1855, the first cornerstone was laid, and construction began on a new city hall. A grant from the Thalian Association funded the attached opera house, named Thalian Hall. In 1857, the city opened its first public school, named the Union Free School, on 6th Street between Nun and Church Streets, serving White students.

Wilmington had a Black majority population before the Civil War. While most were slaves, the city had a significant community of free people of color, who developed businesses and trades. For a period up to Nat Turner&#x27;s rebellion, they had been allowed to vote, carry arms, and serve in the militia. Fears after the rebellion resulted in the state legislature passing laws to restrict the rights of free Blacks.

===Civil War===

During the Civil War, the port was the major base for Confederate and privately owned blockade runners, which delivered badly needed supplies from England. The Union mounted a blockade to reduce the goods received by the South. The city was captured by Union forces in the Battle of Wilmington in February 1865, about one month after the fall of Fort Fisher had closed the port. Wilmington was the last Confederate port to be captured. As nearly all the military action took place some distance from the city, numerous antebellum houses and other buildings survived the war years.

In mid-August 1862, Wilmington was devastated by a deadly outbreak of yellow fever. This fever outbreak was brought about by a blockade runner named &quot;Kate.&quot; Sources suggest that the runner had crew members who were sick before the ship landed, but Dr. W.T. Wragg would later write an article in the &quot;New York Journal of Medicine&quot; that there were at least five cases in the city before the ship arrived. Dr. Wragg treated many of the yellow fever victims during the outbreak and claimed that the dirtiness of the city and the fumes of the dirty water left by heavy rains caused the disease. By the end of the outbreak at least 1,500 and perhaps as many as 2,000, contracted yellow fever. Of those, between 650 and 800 died, a mortality rate approximately 40 percent Walter Reed would later discover in 1900 that yellow fever was transmitted by mosquitoes, so Wilmington&#x27;s outbreak had to be introduced by a third party and spread by mosquitoes in the city.

===Reconstruction era and 1898 insurrection===
During the Reconstruction era, former free Blacks and newly emancipated freedmen built a community in the city. About 55% of its residents were Black people. At the time, Wilmington was the largest city and the economic capital of the state.

Three of the city&#x27;s aldermen were Black. Black people were also in positions of justice of the peace, deputy clerk of court, street superintendent, coroners, policemen, mail clerks, and mail carriers.

At the time, Black people accounted for over 30% of Wilmington&#x27;s skilled craftsmen, such as mechanics, carpenters, jewelers, watchmakers, painters, plasterers, plumbers, stevedores, blacksmiths, masons, and wheelwrights. In addition, they owned 10 of the city&#x27;s 11 restaurants and were 90% of the city&#x27;s 22 barbers. The city had more Black bootmakers/shoemakers than White ones, and half of the city&#x27;s tailors were Black. Lastly, two brothers, Alexander and Frank Manly, owned the &quot;Wilmington Daily Record&quot;, the only Black-owned newspaper in the state, and one of the few in the country at that time.

In the 1890s, a coalition of Republicans and Populists had gained state and federal offices. The Democrats were determined to reassert their control. Violence increased around elections in this period, as armed White paramilitary insurgents, known as Red Shirts, worked to suppress Black and Republican voting. White Democrats regained control of the state legislature and sought to impose white supremacy, but some Blacks continued to be elected to local offices.

The Wilmington Insurrection of 1898 (also known as the Wilmington Race Riot) occurred as a result of the racially charged political conflict that had occurred in the decades after the Civil War and efforts by White Democrats to re-establish white supremacy and overturn Black voting. In 1898, a cadre of White Democrats, professionals, and businessmen planned to overthrow the city government if their candidates were not elected. Two days after the election, in which a White Republican was elected mayor and both White and Black aldermen were elected, more than 1500 White men (led by Democrat Alfred M. Waddell, an unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate in 1896) attacked and burned the only Black-owned daily newspaper in the state and ran off the new officers. They overthrew the legitimately elected municipal government. Waddell and his men forced the elected Republican city officials to resign at gunpoint and replaced them with men selected by leading White Democrats. Waddell was elected mayor by the newly seated board of aldermen that day. Prominent Black Americans and White Republicans were banished from the city in the following days. This is the only such &quot;coup d&#x27;état &quot;in United States history.

Whites attacked and killed an estimated 10–100 Blacks; no Whites died in the violence. As a result of the attacks, more than 2100 Blacks permanently left the city, leaving a hole among its professional and middle classes. The demographic change was so large that the city became majority White, rather than the majority Black it was before the coup.

Following these events, the North Carolina legislature passed a new constitution that raised barriers to voter registration, imposing requirements for poll taxes and literacy tests that effectively disfranchised most Black voters, following the example of Mississippi. Blacks were essentially excluded from the political system until after the enactment of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965.

===20th century===
Wilmington is home to the Bijou Theater, which began as a tent in 1904 and progressed to a permanent structure in 1906. It operated until 1956, making it the oldest movie theater in the state and one of the oldest, continuously running theaters in the country. In 1910, Charlotte passed Wilmington to become North Carolina&#x27;s largest city. In the mid-20th century, efforts to preserve many historic building began. Due to this, many historic buildings were listed as National Register of Historic Places. Since the 1980s, Wilmington has remained the largest film and television production area in the state; many locations in and outside the city have been used for filming. In 1990, the extension of Interstate 40 to New Hanover County was opened and officially connected the region to the Interstate Highway System.


During World War II, Wilmington was the home of the North Carolina Shipbuilding Company. The shipyard was created as part of the U.S. government&#x27;s Emergency Shipbuilding Program. Workers built 243 ships in Wilmington during the five years the company operated.

Three prisoner-of-war (POW) camps operated in the city from February 1944 through April 1946. At their peak, the camps held 550 German prisoners. The first camp was located on the corner of Shipyard Boulevard and Carolina Beach Road; it was moved downtown to Ann Street, between 8th and 10th Avenues, when it outgrew the original location. A smaller contingent of prisoners was assigned to a third site, working in the officers&#x27; mess and doing groundskeeping at Bluethenthal Army Air Base, which is now Wilmington International Airport.

===21st century===
Starting in the 1990s, Wilmington began to grow rapidly, partially due to the film industry and the completion of I-40. The city successfully annexed the areas of Seagate in 1998 and Masonboro in 2000. The annexation of Monkey Junction was stopped in 2012 by the North Carolina House of Representatives after local backlash. In 2017, a chemical compound called GenX, discharged by a Chemours plant near Fayetteville, North Carolina, was first found to be present in the Cape Fear River; a major water source for the region. It was also revealed that the same plant had been discharging the chemical compound since 1980. In 2020, then-President Donald Trump designated Wilmington as the first World War II Heritage City in the country due to the city&#x27;s contributions during the war.

===National Register of Historic Places===
The Audubon Trolley Station, Brookwood Historic District, Carolina Heights Historic District, Carolina Place Historic District, City Hall/Thalian Hall, Delgrado School, Federal Building and Courthouse, Fort Fisher, Gabriel&#x27;s Landing, James Walker Nursing School Quarters, Market Street Mansion District, Masonboro Sound Historic District, Moores Creek National Battlefield, Sunset Park Historic District, USS &quot;North Carolina&quot; (BB-55) National Historic Landmark, Westbrook-Ardmore Historic District, William Hooper School (Former), Wilmington Historic District, and Wilmington National Cemetery are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Wilmington is the eastern terminus of Interstate 40, an east-west freeway that ends 2,554 miles away at Barstow, California, where it joins I-15, the gateway to Southern California. This road passes through many major cities and state capitals along the way.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (2.95%) is water.
Wrightsville Beach is a common destination in the Wilmington area. Carolina Beach and Kure Beach also add to the city&#x27;s attractions.

===Cityscape===

Wilmington boasts a large historic district encompassing nearly 300 blocks. Abandoned warehouses on downtown&#x27;s northern end have been recently demolished making room for multimillion dollar projects, such as what was the world headquarters of Pharmaceutical Product Development and current tallest building in Wilmington at . (The building was then bought by Thermo Fisher Scientific. In 2023, it was bought by the City of Wilmington and renamed &quot;Skyline Center&quot;. It is now the main building for city government operations.) Other completed projects include a state-of-the-art convention center, Live Oak Bank Pavilion, Pier 33 Apartments, and The Cove houseboat community in Port City Marina.

In 2014, Governor Pat McCrory decided not to renew the film incentives, which ended up taking a massive toll on not just Wilmington&#x27;s but North Carolina&#x27;s entire film industry. As a result, most productions and film businesses moved to other cities, especially to Atlanta, Georgia. For the years following, were many attempts to bring the industry back to North Carolina via the North Carolina Film and Entertainment Grant. This grant designates $31 million per fiscal year (Jul 1 – Jun 30) in film incentives.

In the early 2020s, after the COVID-19 lockdowns and changes to state legislation, filming in the city began to increase again, with 2021 being the biggest year to date for both the city&#x27;s film industry as well as the whole film industry at large in North Carolina.

In 2022, Dark Horse Studios—which became Wilmington&#x27;s second film studio in 2020—planned a 20-million-dollar expansion to their studio complex in Wilmington, set to be complete in 2024.

On September 8, 2008, at noon, WWAY, WECT, WSFX, WILM-LP and W51CW all turned off their analog signals, making Wilmington the first market in the nation to go digital-only as part of a test by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to iron out transition and reception concerns before the nationwide shutoff. Wilmington was chosen as the test market because the area&#x27;s digital channel positions will remain unchanged after the transition. As the area&#x27;s official conduit of emergency information, WUNJ did not participate in the early analog switchoff, and kept their analog signal on until the national digital switchover date of June 12, 2009. W47CK did not participate due to its low-power status; FCC rules currently exempt low-powered stations from the 2009 analog shutdown. WILM-LP and W51CW chose to participate, even though they are exempt as LPTV stations.

Despite Tropical Storm Hanna making landfall southwest of Wilmington two days before (September 6), the switchover continued as scheduled. The ceremony was marked by governmental and television representatives flipping a large switch (marked with the slogan &quot;First in Flight, First in Digital&quot;) from analog to digital.

<text>Wrightsville Beach is a town in New Hanover County, North Carolina, United States. Wrightsville Beach is just east of Wilmington and is part of the Wilmington Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,477 at the 2010 census. The town consists of a long beach island, an interior island called Harbor Island, and pockets of commercial property on the mainland. It served as a filming location of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;.

==History==
===Establishment===

The first documented history of present-day Wrightsville Beach began when the Lords Proprietors granted land to Charles Harrison in 1725. The land grant was for located north of the present day Heide Trask Bridge that runs over the Intracoastal Waterway and was the first formal ownership of property near the beach. In the 1700 and 1800s the Hammocks were accessible by a footbridge from the mainland, but the beach itself was only accessible by boat.

In 1883, the Carolina Yacht Club was founded by seven local men who loved to sail and race boats. It is currently known as the seventh oldest Yacht club in America. It was the first permanent structure on the beach and was only accessible by boat. This was followed by a few scattered cottages and commercial buildings began springing up on what was then known as Ocean View Beach.

The town bears the name of Joshua G. Wright of Wilmington (1842-1890), who developed a local realtor company. A post office called Wrightsville was subsequently established in 1881. Accessibility to the beach improved in 1887 when Shell Road was completed, running from Wilmington to the edge of the current Intracoastal Waterway. The town was incorporated in 1899 as Wrightsville Beach, in honor of the Wright family of Wilmington and the community of Wrightsville on the mainland side of Harbor Island.

===Development===
By the late 1800s, ownership of the land had passed to the MacRae family of Wilmington. In 1887 passenger service began on the Wilmington Sea Coast Railroad from Wilmington, bringing people from downtown Wilmington to the edge of Bradley Creek. In 1889, the Ocean View Railroad built a track across Banks Channel to carry visitors to the oceanfront.

Having already established a power generation company, in 1902 Hugh MacRae (March 30, 1865 - October 20, 1951) took control of the city of Wilmington&#x27;s utilities by forming the Consolidated Railroad, Power &amp; Light Company (CRPLCo - subsequently renamed the Tidewater Power Company, which became part of the Carolina Power &amp; Light Company in 1952 post-MacRae&#x27;s death). The Ocean View Railroad was subsequently converted to an electric streetcar. After MacRae subsequently took over the Wilmington Sea Coast Railroad, he consolidated the area&#x27;s lines into one electric streetcar system, carrying people from downtown Wilmington to one of seven stations along South Lumina Avenue. Automobiles were banned from Wrightsville Beach until the 1930s, giving the CRPLCo streetcar a virtual monopoly on transportation. The streetcar operations also carried freight with adapted freight cars, often part of the operations consist mainly of carrying ice in an era before indoor refrigeration was available, allowing the subsequent development of far more snack stands and soda shops along the beach.

With the CRPLCo electric streetcar now in operation, the MacRae family began developing plots of land both along the streetcar line and Wrightsville Beach as a beach resort. The two hotels on the beach were renovated, and the first public entertainment venue on the beach was built, named Lumina, because of the 6,000 exterior lights that illuminated the building. It was opened in 1905 with a venue for dancing and socializing, games, food, and entertainment. It attracted many entertainers and musicians, including the Big Bands of the 1930s and 40s. In 1913, Lumina enlarged the dance floor and added a movie screen in the surf from which they showed silent films. After World War II, its popularity slowly declined due to the cancellation of the trolley service to the beach in 1940 and the growing number of other entertainment venues in and around the area. Lumina changed hands a few times after the war as people tried various ways to make it the hottest spot on the beach. It was a skating alley and then a bar before it was closed in 1972. The health department then condemned lumina. It was torn down in 1973 to make room for condominiums along the beach.

In 1923 Shell Island was purchased by the Home Realty Company to build a resort for African Americans in the community. They built a pavilion, boardwalks, concessions, and bathhouses. Visitors could ride the streetcar to Harbor Island and board the ferry, taking them over to Shell Island. But in 1926, a massive fire burned every structure on the island. Never rebuilt, transportation to Shell Island also hence ceased.

In 1937 the third pier in North Carolina, the Ocean View Pier, was constructed. In 1939 it was bought by Johnnie Mercer and renamed after its new owner. Hurricanes have really taken a toll on the pier. It was hit by hurricanes Hazel, Connie, Bertha, and Fran. After Fran in 1996, the pier was so damaged that it was closed until 2002, reopening with a whole new look. The current Johnnie Mercer&#x27;s Pier is made of reinforced concrete and still stands today. A second pier was constructed in 1938 by Floyd Cox and named the Mira Mar Fishing Pier. It was built on top of the wreck of the Fanny and Jenny, a Confederate blockade runner that ran aground during its maiden voyage in the Civil War in 1864. The wreckage created a natural reef, making for good fishing. Originally Mira Mar was long and boasted a bowling alley and restaurant. The pier was later bought and briefly renamed the Luna Fishing Pier and then the Crystal Fishing Pier.

The construction and popularity of these new buildings were made possible in part by constructing a highway and car bridge to the beach in 1935. A causeway from the mainland to Harbor Island was built in 1926. This allowed people to drive to the first part of the beach. The opening of a road all the way from the mainland to the beach, with a bridge over Banks Channel, allowed residents and visitors to access the town via road easily. On April 18, 1939, W.R. &quot;Tuck&quot; Savage, who had operated the first electric streetcar in Wilmington, also piloted the city&#x27;s last one on a return trip to Wrightsville Beach.

==Storm activity==
Wrightsville Beach has weathered many storms. Two devastating hurricanes hit in 1899. The first hurricane hit on August 17, making landfall at Hatteras with widespread destruction at Wrightsville Beach. The second storm came just south of Wrightsville Beach on November 1 at high tide. Many structures and buildings on the island were damaged. Cottages were wiped off the beach, the train trestle was damaged, and the Carolina Yacht Club had to be completely rebuilt. A few smaller storms hit in the early 1900s, but none did extensive damage.

The next big hit came in 1954 from Hurricane Hazel, which made landfall at Holden Beach. This was the third named hurricane to hit the area within seven weeks and is the only category 4 hurricane to make landfall in North Carolina. The storm headed up the coast devastating Yaupon Beach, Long Beach and Southport before hitting Carolina Beach and Wrightsville Beach. Hurricane Connie hit the beach in 1955 and caused damages to Johnnie Mercer&#x27;s Pier and other houses along the beach.

In 1996, the area was hit by two hurricanes, Bertha and Fran, within months of each other. The storms destroyed the beaches&#x27; fishing piers and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of damage.

In 1999, the area was affected by Hurricane Dennis, which dumped heavy rains and recorded gusts up to at Wrightsville and set up the catastrophic flooding disaster that would be the result of Hurricane Floyd&#x27;s landfall nearby just weeks later.

Hurricane Florence made landfall in Wrightsville Beach in 2018 as a Category 1 storm with maximum winds.

* Cape Fear Civil War Shipwreck Discontiguous District
* Mount Lebanon Chapel and Cemetery

==Geography==
The area&#x27;s geography is composed of two islands separated by two different bodies of water. Bradley Creek runs between the mainland and the Hammocks (currently known as Harbor Island). The Hammocks are then separated from the beach by Banks Channel. Wrightsville Beach lies south of Figure Eight Island, separated by Mason&#x27;s Inlet, and north of Masonboro Island, separated by Masonboro Inlet.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which 1.3 square miles (3.4 km2) is land and (44.40%) is water.

<text>Rich Square (also known as Richsquare) is an American town of 894 people in Northampton County, North Carolina.

==History==
Quakers were some of the earliest settlers in Northampton County, being established there by the early 1750s. The congregation in Rich Square was established in 1760, and was once a center for the Religious Society of Friends in North Carolina. By 1832, they were a minority in Rich Square, though they continued working to relocate former slaves into free states.

In 1947, Godwin Bush was a black man in Northampton County who escaped a lynching by a white mob; two all-white grand juries refused to indict the seven white kidnappers. In response, local pastor and businessman Paul A. Bishop promoted a black-led boycott of white-owned businesses in Rich Square (contemporaneously described by a black community leader as &quot;a town that didn&#x27;t like black folk.&quot;) Many of the boycotted stores went out of business.

On July 26, 1959, Lieutenant Colonel William Rankin was flying his US Marine Corps F8U Crusader from Naval Air Station South Weymouth in Massachusetts to Naval Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina. When he lost all power at an altitude of , he ejected into the air and began uncontrolled decompression through an intense thunderstorm and hail for the next 40 minutes. After &quot;the most prolonged and fantastic parachute descent in history&quot;, he eventually landed near Rich Square, from where he was rescued by a local farmer and eventually taken to Ahoskie, North Carolina for triage. (The plane came down near Scotland Neck, North Carolina.)

In 1968, the federal government of the United States established the Family Development Training Project in Rich Square, an effort up uplift families in poverty by simultaneously educating all members thereof at government expense. On a parcel of town, twelve training and support buildings were constructed to support the 50 families living in 50 colocated mobile homes. Eligible families must have been employed by two or more employers in the preceding year, and annually earn less than . In 1974, &quot;The Family Coordinator&quot; called the five-year program &quot;one of the most unique and successful programs ever developed in the United States&quot;.

The Duke-Lawrence House is a recognized example of Georgian architecture in Rich Square, and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in October 1980. The local Holoman-Outland House was recognized for its Colonial Revival architecture and listed on the register in October 2001.

==Geography==
The town of Rich Square is located in Northampton County, North Carolina, at , with an elevation of .

<doc id="128099" wikidata="Q81162" url="?curid=128099" title="Magdalen College, Oxford">
<text>Magdalen College ( ) is a constituent college of the University of Oxford. It was founded in 1458 by Bishop of Winchester William of Waynflete. It is one of the wealthiest Oxford colleges, as of 2022, and one of the strongest academically, setting the record for the highest Norrington Score in 2010 and topping the table twice since then. It is home to several of the university&#x27;s distinguished chairs, including the Agnelli-Serena Professorship, the Sherardian Professorship, and the four Waynflete Professorships.

The large, square Magdalen Tower is an Oxford landmark, and it is a tradition, dating to the days of Henry VII, that the college choir sings from the top of it at 6 a.m. on May Morning. The college stands next to the River Cherwell and the University of Oxford Botanic Garden. Within its grounds are a deer park and Addison&#x27;s Walk.

==History==
=== Foundation ===
Magdalen College was founded in 1458 by William of Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor of England and named after St Mary Magdalene. The college succeeded a university hall called Magdalen Hall, founded by Waynflete in 1448, and from which the college drew most of its earliest scholars. Magdalen Hall was suppressed when the college was founded. The name was revived for a second Magdalen Hall, established in the college&#x27;s grounds around 1490, which in the 19th century was moved to Catte Street and became Hertford College. 
Waynflete also established a school, now Magdalen College School, a private school located nearby on the other side of the Cherwell. Waynflete was assisted by a large bequest from Sir John Fastolf, who wished to fund a religious college.

Magdalen College took over the site of St John the Baptist Hospital, alongside the Cherwell, initially using the hospital&#x27;s buildings until new construction was completed between 1470 and 1480. At incorporation in 1458, the college consisted of a president and six scholars. In 1487 when the Founder&#x27;s Statutes were written, the foundation consisted of a President, 40 fellows, 30 demies, four chaplain priests, eight clerks, 16 choristers, and appointed to the Grammar School, a Master and an usher.

The founder&#x27;s statutes included provision for a choral foundation of men and boys (a tradition that has continued to the present day) and made reference to the pronunciation of the name of the college in English. The college&#x27;s name is pronounced like the adjective because the late medieval English name of Mary Magdalene was Maudelen, derived from the Old French Madelaine.

===English Civil War===

Oxford and Magdalen College were supporters of the Royalist cause during the English Civil War. In 1642, Magdalen College donated over 296 lbs of plate (ie. silver or gold utensils or dishes) to fund the war effort – the largest donation by weight of any Oxford college.

Magdalen College, commanding a position on the banks of the Cherwell that overlooked Magdalen Bridge and the road from London, had tactical significance for the King&#x27;s forces. From 1643 to 1645, Magdalen&#x27;s Grove was occupied by the Royalist ordnance, and Prince Rupert is thought to have quartered in the college.

The city built fortifications in preparation for siege through Magdalen&#x27;s grounds, including Dover&#x27;s Speare (or Pier), a bastion that would have allowed observation to the north and east of the city. The earthworks where it was located, in the Water Meadow where the Cherwell forks, are still apparent today. Further fortifications and earthworks were built to protect the Holywell Ford site to the north.
During the first Siege of Oxford, Charles I surveyed the battle from Magdalen Tower.

Following the capitulation of Oxford to Thomas Fairfax at the end of the First English Civil War, Parliament ordered a Visitation to Oxford to purge Fellows for political and religious reasons. In 1647, the Visitors removed the then-president of Magdalen John Oliver and appointed instead one of their number, John Wilkinson, a former Principal of Magdalen Hall who had previously run unsuccessfully for the position of President at the college. When they refused to submit to the authority of Parliament, around 28 of the fellows, 21 of the demies (scholars), and all but one of the servants were also expelled. With the Royalists finally removed, the college would host Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell in 1649.

After the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 John Oliver was reappointed to the college, followed by 17 fellows and eight demies.

===Expulsion of the Fellows===

During the 1680s, King James II made several moves to reintroduce Catholicism into the then Anglican university. In 1687, he attempted to install Anthony Farmer as president of Magdalen. The fellows rejected this, not just because Farmer was reputedly a Catholic and had a tarnished reputation, but also as he was not a fellow of the college, and therefore ineligible under the statutes. The fellows elected instead one of their own, John Hough. James eventually offered a compromise candidate in the form of the moderate Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Parker, but he too was rejected by the fellows as they considered the role filled.

Parker was admitted by force and the fellows and demies who had defied the king were expelled, replaced by the king&#x27;s choice of Catholics or moderate Anglicans. Parker died in 1688 and was replaced by Bonaventure Giffard, a Catholic under whose tenure the Chapel converted to Catholicism.

The expulsion of the fellows marked a turning point in the university&#x27;s relationship with the Crown: Brockliss writes, &quot;the royalist and Anglican University established at the Restoration had had to make a choice and it had chosen Anglicanism.&quot; James&#x27; interference with the college fed resentment in Anglicans who used it as evidence that his rule was autocratic. On 25 October 1688, shortly before the Glorious Revolution and overthrow of James II by William of Orange, James&#x27; appointments were reversed and Hough and the expelled fellows were restored to the college. This event is marked every year at a special banquet, the Restoration Dinner, for Magdalen fellows, demies, and academic clerks.

===20th–21st centuries===

Magdalen&#x27;s prominence since the mid-20th century owes much to such famous fellows as C. S. Lewis and A. J. P. Taylor, and its academic success to the work of such dons as Thomas Dewar Weldon. During World War II, RAF Maintenance Command was headquartered at Magdalen.

Magdalen College owns and manages the Oxford Science Park to the south of Oxford, a science and technology park home to over 100 companies. The Oxford Science Park opened in 1991, with Magdalen as part owner. The college acquired total ownership in 2016, before selling 40% of its stake in 2021 for £160 million. It was reported that this sale will more than double the size of Magdalen&#x27;s endowment fund, and make it &quot;probably the richest of Oxford&#x27;s 39 colleges&quot;.

Like many of Oxford&#x27;s colleges, Magdalen admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979, after more than half a millennium as a men-only institution. Between 2015 and 2017, 47.2% of UK undergraduates admitted to Magdalen were from state schools; 12.2% were of BME (&quot;black and ethnic minority&quot;) heritage and 0.7% were black. Of the 300 undergraduate offers made by Magdalen between 2017 and 2019, 25 (one in twelve) went to pupils from Eton College or Westminster School.

==Architecture==

The college grounds stretch north and east from the college, and include most of the area bounded by Longwall Street, the High Street (where the porter&#x27;s lodge is located), and St Clement&#x27;s. The college features a variety of architectural styles, and has been described as &quot;a medieval nucleus with two incomplete additions, one from the eighteenth and one from the nineteenth century&quot;.

The college is organised around five quads. The irregularly shaped St John&#x27;s Quad is the first on entering the college, and includes the Outdoor Pulpit and old Grammar Hall. It connects to the Great Quad (the Cloister) via the Perpendicular Gothic Founders Tower, which is richly decorated with carvings and pinnacles and has carved bosses in its vault. The Chaplain&#x27;s Quad runs along the side of the Chapel and Hall, to the foot of the Great Tower. St Swithun&#x27;s Quad and Longwall Quad (which contains the Library) date from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and make up the southwest corner of the college.

===Original buildings===
The college is built on the site of St John the Baptist Hospital, which was dissolved in 1457 and its property granted to William of Waynflete. Some of the hospital buildings were reused by the college, and the kitchens survive today as the college bar, the Old Kitchen Bar.

New construction began in 1470 with the erection of a wall around the site by mason William Orchard. Following this, Orchard also worked on the chapel, hall, and the cloister, including the Muniment and Founder&#x27;s Towers, with work completed around 1480.

===Cloister===

The Cloister or Great Quad is the &quot;medieval nucleus&quot; of the college. It was constructed between 1474 and 1480, also by Orchard, although several modifications were made later. Access to the Cloister from St John&#x27;s Quad is via the Founder&#x27;s Tower or Muniment Tower. The chapel and the hall make up the southern side of the quad. It is also home to the junior, middle, and senior common rooms, and the old library.

In 1508, grotesques known as hieroglyphics were added to the Cloister. These are thought to be allegorical, and include four hieroglyphics in front of the old library that represent scholarly subjects: science, medicine, law, and theology. The other hieroglyphics have been assigned symbolism relating to virtues that should be encouraged by the college (e.g. the lion and pelican grotesques in front of the Senior Common Room representing courage and parental affection) or vices that should be avoided (the manticore, boxers, and lamia in front of the Junior Common Room, representing pride, contention, and lust). In 2017, repair work was undertaken to restore the severely damaged boxers statue.

In 1822, the north side of the Cloister was knocked down, ostensibly due to disrepair. This decision was controversial, provoking protests from the fellows and in the contemporary press, and it was rebuilt shortly afterwards.

In the early 1900s, renovations were performed, and it was returned to a more medieval character. Student rooms were installed in the (very large) roof space in the 1980s.

===Chapel===
The chapel is a place of worship for members of the college and others in the University of Oxford community and beyond. As a High Anglican chapel, its tradition is influenced by the Counter-Reformation in the Church of England. Said and sung services are held daily during term. The choir sings Choral Evensong or Evening Prayer every day at 6:00 pm except on Mondays. On Sundays, a Sung Eucharist is offered in the morning at 11:00 am. Compline (Night Prayer) is sung once each week, and is followed by a service of Benediction twice per term. Mass is also sung on major holy days.

The chapel itself is a grade I listed building. It was built between 1474 and 1480, although it owes its present appearance largely to neo-Gothic works carried out in the 18th and 19th centuries.

;Vaulting
The roof, giving the impression of a stone vaulted ceiling, is in fact a facsimile made from plaster added in 1790 by neo-Gothic architect James Wyatt. Wyatt&#x27;s redevelopment of the chapel included a number of modifications to make it more Gothic in character, but other than the ceiling, Wyatt&#x27;s contributions were removed during a later redesign in 1828.

;Reredos
After 1662, a painting (or possibly a mural) of the Last Judgement by Isaac Fuller was placed at the east end. This piece of work was taken down during architect Lewis Cottingham&#x27;s work in the early 1830s, and fragments of the original reredos were discovered behind it. These showed that the original reredos had had three tiers of niches, each tier containing thirteen niches. Cottingham replaced Isaac Fuller&#x27;s painting at the east end with the current reredos, the layout of which was based on those remains. This reredos remained void of figures until 1864/5, when it was completed by neo-Gothic sculptor Thomas Earp.

;Stained glass windows
The stained glass windows facing St John&#x27;s Quad feature a &quot;grisaille&quot; depiction of the Last Judgement. These windows, dating from 1792, are a reconstruction by glass painter Francis Eginton of an earlier 17th-century window that was destroyed in a storm. It had been uninstalled during World War II to protect it from damage, and was only restored in the 1990s. Much of the glass had been thought lost, until it was rediscovered in the ventilation tunnels under the New Building.

===Magdalen Tower===
Construction of Magdalen&#x27;s Great Tower began in 1492 by another mason, William Raynold. It might have been intended to replace an existing belfry remaining from the hospital, and probably was originally envisioned to stand alone. By the time it was completed in 1509, additional buildings had been built either side, creating the roughly triangular Chaplain&#x27;s quad between the chapel and the High.

The tower contains a peal of ten bells hung for English change ringing. They were cast at a number of different foundries and the heaviest, weighing 17 cwt, was cast in 1623.

The tower is 144 feet tall and an imposing landmark on the eastern approaches to the city centre. It has been the model for other towers, including Mitchell Tower of the University of Chicago, Manhattan&#x27;s First Presbyterian Church, and All Saints&#x27; Church in Churchill, Oxfordshire. It forms the centre of the May Morning celebrations in Oxford, from which the choir sing pieces including the Hymnus Eucharisticus and the Dean of Divinity blesses the University, city, and crowds.

===The New Building===

During the 18th and 19th centuries, there were numerous attempts made to redesign the site to better suit the college&#x27;s needs. The New Building began construction in 1733 as a part of Edward Holdsworth&#x27;s designs from 1731. It is built in a Palladian style, and features a colonnade.

It was conceived as one side of a new &quot;Great Quadrangle&quot;, and in anticipation of this the building&#x27;s ends had been left unfinished. However, Holdsworth&#x27;s full vision was never completed. The idea was revisited several times by later architects, including by architects James Wyatt—whose plans (never realised) included partially demolishing the existing, Medieval quad (the Cloister) and refinishing the neoclassical New Building in a Georgian Gothic style—and John Buckler. In the 19th century, John Nash and Humphrey Repton both submitted designs for new, open quadrangles that incorporated the New Building.

Ultimately, the idea of integrating the New Building into a new quad was abandoned, and the ends of the building were finally completed in 1824 with two returns designed by Thomas Harrison. Today, it stands apart from the Cloister, overlooking four croquet lawns on one side and the Grove deer park on the other. It is used for accommodation for undergraduates and fellows, including historically Edward Gibbon and C. S. Lewis, and also houses the wine cellar.

===Daubeny laboratory===

Opposite the main college site and overlooking the Botanic Garden is the 19th century Daubeny Laboratory.

The Garden had been established between 1622 and 1633 as a physic garden (that is, a garden to study the medicinal value of plants) on land inherited by Magdalen from St. John&#x27;s Hospital. The Daubeny Laboratory, and neighbouring Professor&#x27;s House, were founded by the polymath and Magdalen fellow Charles Daubeny after he was appointed to the Sherardian Chair of Botany in 1834.

Daubeny set about a number of additions to the location, erecting new glasshouses and in 1836 creating an on-site residence for the Professor of Botany. This replaced an earlier residence that had been demolished in 1795 when the road was widened. The new residence was an extension of the library, which had been created out of a glasshouse by an earlier Sherardian professor, John Sibthorp, to house the Sherard herbarium. After Daubeny&#x27;s death, this was assimilated to house the growing collection. Later, it became accommodation for graduate students, the Professor&#x27;s House, while the Sherard Herbarium is now part of the Fielding-Druce Herbarium held in the Department of Plant Sciences.

Daubeny, who was also the Aldrichian Professor of Chemistry, had found the chemistry laboratory in the basement of the old Ashmolean Museum, what is now the History of Science Museum, to be &quot;notoriously unworthy of a great University&quot; and desired a better science facility. He petitioned the college to be allowed to build one, and the Daubeny laboratory was completed in 1848. The Daubeny Laboratory was preceded by the anatomy school and laboratory at Christ Church which opened in 1767, and would be followed later in the century by other college laboratories including the Balliol-Trinity Laboratories. Daubeny&#x27;s laboratory was a two-storey room with benches and cupboards encircled by a gallery, and became the principal chemistry lab for the university. In 1902, due to growing student numbers and poor ventilation, the laboratory trappings were removed and it was refitted as a lecture hall. In 1973, most of the Daubeny Laboratory building was reconfigured into graduate student accommodation. The Daubeny lab itself is now a conference space.

===St Swithun&#x27;s quad===
In 1880–1884, the college extended westwards onto the former site of Magdalen Hall. The hall was an independent academic hall that developed from Magdalen College School, not the earlier Magdalen Hall founded by William Waynflete. Most of Magdalen Hall&#x27;s buildings were destroyed by fire in 1820, though the Grammar Hall survived and was restored by Joseph Parkinson. The hall moved to Catte Street in 1822 and was incorporated as Hertford College in 1874.

The new construction, St Swithun&#x27;s quad (sometimes given as St. Swithin&#x27;s quad), was designed by George Frederick Bodley and Thomas Garner in keeping with the Gothic style. They had originally designed three sides of a square, though only the south and west sides were built. In 1928, Giles Gilbert Scott extended the building north and westwards, forming the adjacent Longwall quad.

===Modern buildings and acquisitions===

Several new additions to the college were made in the late 20th century. The Waynflete Building, which is located across Magdalen Bridge from the main college site, was designed by Booth, Ledeboer, and Pinckheard and completed in 1964. Magdalen has a number of additional annexes near to the main site for accommodation, including in Cowley Place and Longwall Street.

The Grove Buildings, located north of Longwall quad between Longwall Street and the Grove, were built in 1994–1999 by Porphyrios Associates. They are home to accommodation, Magdalen&#x27;s 160-seat auditorium, and the Denning Law Library. During term time, the auditorium hosts film screenings organised by the Magdalen Film Society.

Along Addison&#x27;s Walk is the Holywell Ford site, where most of the graduate accommodation is located. Holywell Ford house was built by Clapton Crabb Rolfe in 1888 on the location of an older mill, and was acquired by Magdalen in the 1970s. Additional blocks of accommodation were built in 1994-5 by RH Partnership Ltd.

===Libraries===

In addition to the university&#x27;s central and departmental libraries, Oxford&#x27;s colleges maintain their own libraries. The original college library, the Old Library, is located in the Cloister and accessed via Founder&#x27;s Tower or the President&#x27;s Lodgings. It contains a large collection of manuscripts from before the 19th century. Consultation of material is typically by appointment, although the Old Library itself may be visited by the public during certain exhibitions.

In 1931, the New Library, now called the Longwall Library, was established in the former Magdalen College School building in Longwall Quad and became the college&#x27;s main library for students. It was opened by Edward VIII when he was a student at Magdalen. It was renovated between 2014 and 2016 by Wright &amp; Wright Architects and reopened by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge.

In addition, the college maintains the Denning Law Library in the Grove building, a reference library for Magdalen&#x27;s law students, and the specialist Daubeny and McFarlane collections of 19th century scientific works and medieval history works respectively. Items from the Daubeny and McFarlane libraries may be brought to the Longwall Library for consultation on request.

==Grounds==

===The Grove===

The Grove or deer park is a large meadow which occupies most of the north west of the college&#x27;s grounds, from the New Building and the Grove Buildings to Holywell Ford. During the winter and spring, it is the home of a herd of fallow deer. It is possible to view the meadow and the deer from the path between New Buildings and Grove Quad, and also from the archway in New Buildings.

In the 16th Century, as recorded in a map from 1578, the Grove consisted of formal enclosed gardens, tree-lined avenues, an orchard, and a fish pond. By 1630, a bowling green had replaced the orchard.

During the Civil War, between 1642 and 1645, the Grove became home to the workshops, forges, and foundries of Royal Ordinance. Following this, the landscaping began to transition from formal gardens to more natural parkland, and the water walks were landscaped. Deer began being cultivated in the college by at least the 1720s, and by the early 19th century the formal gardens had completely disappeared and college Fellow Dr Bloxham noted that the entire Grove had been given over to the deer.

At one point in the 19th century it was home to three traction engines belonging to the works department of the college. By the 20th century it had become well-wooded with many large trees, but most of them were lost to Dutch elm disease in the 1970s.

===Water meadow and Addison&#x27;s Walk===

The water meadow is a flood-meadow to the eastern side of the college, bounded on all sides by the Cherwell. In wet winters, some or all of the meadow may flood, as the meadow is lower lying than the surrounding path. All around the edge of the meadow is a tree-lined path, Addison&#x27;s Walk, named for the fellow Joseph Addison (1672–1719), which connects to Holywell Ford and the Fellows&#x27; Garden.

Addison&#x27;s Walk is popular with College members and visitors. C. S. Lewis wrote a poem about the walk, &quot;Chanson d&#x27;Aventure&quot; or &quot;What the Bird Said Early in the Year&quot;, which is commemorated on a plaque near the gate to Holywell Ford.

Thanks to the frequent flooding, the meadow is one of the few places in the UK that the snake&#x27;s head fritillary, &quot;Fritillaria meleagris&quot;, may be seen growing wild. These flowers grow in very few places, and have been recorded growing in the meadow since around 1785. Once the flowering has finished, the deer herd is moved in for the summer and autumn.

===Bat Willow meadow and the Fellows&#x27; Garden===

Further east of the water meadow are Bat Willow meadow and the Fellows&#x27; Garden. They are separated from the water meadow and each other by other branches of the Cherwell, and may be accessed from Addison&#x27;s Walk. Bat Willow meadow features &quot;Y&quot;, a 10 metre high sculpture of a branching tree by Mark Wallinger, commissioned for the college&#x27;s 550th anniversary in 2008. Due to their age and infection with honey fungus, the willow trees were cut down in 2018 and replanted, and the wood used to make cricket bats.

The Fellows&#x27; Garden is located further north along the bank of the Cherwell than Bat Willow meadow, directly behind the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies. This long and narrow garden follows the Cherwell to the edge of the University Parks. Further north is Magdalen&#x27;s sports ground.

==Choir==
Magdalen is one of the three choral foundations in Oxford, meaning that the formation of the choir was part of the statutes of the college, the other choral foundations being New College and Christ Church. It performs during chapel services, college gaudies and at other special events throughout the year. As part of Oxford&#x27;s annual May Morning in a tradition that dates back 500 years, at 6 a.m. on 1 May, the choir perform Hymnus Eucharisticus from the top of Magdalen&#x27;s Tower to crowds below on Madgalen Bridge and the High Street.

The choir consists of twelve academical clerks, or choral scholars, and two organ scholars, who are all students at the college, and sixteen choristers, all of whom have scholarships at Magdalen College School, and is led by a director of music known as the Informator Choristarum, currently Mark Williams. Mark Williams succeeded Daniel Hyde in 2017, following Hyde&#x27;s appointment as Organist and Director of Music of Saint Thomas Church, New York. Among the other former directors of the choir are John Sheppard (1543–c.1552), John Varley Roberts, Sir William McKie, Haldane Campbell Stewart and the composer Bill Ives (1991–2009).

Past academical clerks include John Mark Ainsley, Harry Christophers (founder and director of The Sixteen), James Whitbourn, Peter Harvey, Robin Blaze, Paul Agnew, Roderick Williams and conductor/composer Gregory Rose. The choir has had many well-known organists, such as Daniel Purcell, Sir John Stainer (1860–1872) and Bernard Rose (1957–1981). Past organ scholars include Dudley Moore and Paul Brough.

As well as performing during chapel services, the choir tours and records music. In 2005, the choir was nominated for a Grammy Award for its CD, &quot;With a Merrie Noyse&quot;, of music by Orlando Gibbons. Other recent works include the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Planet&quot; and Paul McCartney&#x27;s classical piece &quot;Ecce Cor Meum&quot;.

==Student life==

===Accommodation===

Undergraduate students of the college are guaranteed accommodation during term for their entire degree, typically in the Waynflete building in their first year and &quot;inside-walls&quot; in the Cloister, St Swithun&#x27;s Quad, the New Building and so on in subsequent years. Graduate students are guaranteed at least two years of accommodation. Unlike undergraduates, graduates are not required to move out between terms and typically live &quot;outside walls&quot;, including in Holywell Ford, the Daubeny Laboratory, and Professor&#x27;s House.

Accommodation charges are inclusive of heating, power, and internet access, and weekly cleaning by the college scouts (housekeepers), but do not include catering. Three cafeteria-style meals a day are served in the hall, and other food is available in the Old Kitchen Bar.

In addition to a dinner cafeteria service served in the hall, four Formal Halls are held a week during term time. These are three-course sit-down dinners and require college members to wear their gowns. Additional banquets commemorate special occasions, including the Restoration Dinner.

===Events and societies===

The body of undergraduate and graduate students are known as the junior and middle common rooms (JCR and MCR) respectively. They each elect committees of students annually to organise welfare events, socials, and banquets.

In addition to clubs and societies associated with the Oxford University Student Union operated at the university level, Magdalen members may also participate in several college societies. The Atkin Society and the Sherrington Society are two subject-specific societies, for law students and medicine students respectively. They organise talks and social events. The Atkin society is named for lawyer James Atkin, Baron Atkin, a former demy at Magdalen, and also organises annually a Christmas Dinner for its members, moot court presided over by a guest judge, and summer garden party. The Sherrington Society is named after Nobel laureate Sir Charles Scott Sherrington, former Waynflete Professor of Physiology. The college also has a poetry discussion forum called the Florio Society, named for 16th century college alumnus John Florio.

A number of other societies put on events throughout the year. These include the Magdalen Players, a drama society; the Magdalen Music Society; and the Magdalen Film Society, which screens films during term time in the Grove Auditorium. The Magdalen College Music Society is a chapter of the Oxford University Music Society and incorporates a non-auditioned mixed choir, a chamber orchestra, and a saxophone ensemble. The society performs recitals in college on Thursdays during term time.

The Magdalen College Trust is an independent charity that is funded by annual subscriptions from students and fellows. It encourages college members to engage in charity work, and funds charitable causes.

===Academia===
In the Norrington Table&#x27;s history Magdalen has been top three times, in 2010, 2012 and 2015. When over half its finalists achieved firsts in 2010, it claimed the record for the highest ever Norrington Score. Magdalen has the second highest average Norrington Table score from 2006 to 2019, only behind Merton College.

Magdalen College students have a successful record in the &quot;University Challenge&quot; television competition, winning on four occasions (1997, 1998, 2004, and 2011). This is the joint highest number of series wins, tied with Manchester University, and at the time of Magdalen&#x27;s third win no other institution had won more than twice.

Unlike at most other colleges, students awarded a scholarship at Magdalen are officially referred to as Demies.

===Sports===
Magdalen members have access to a variety of sports facilities. The Magdalen College Recreation Ground, accessible from the main college via Addison&#x27;s Walk, include pitches for cricket, soccer, hockey, and rugby; also available on site are tennis courts and squash courts. The Recreation Ground played host to a first-class cricket match in 1912, when Oxford played the touring South Africans. The match was heavily affected by rain and ended in a draw, but did see Oxford&#x27;s John Evans make scores of 56 and 107, in addition to taking a five wicket haul in the South Africans first innings. During the First World War, there were talks between the college and the local allotment association to turn the ground in allotments to aid the war effort, but both parties were unable to reach an agreement.

In addition, the college buys gym membership at the Iffley Road sports complex on behalf of all its students. The college keeps a boathouse on The Isis (the length of the Thames as it passes through Oxford) for the Magdalen College Boat Club (MCBC).

The Magdalen College Boat Club (MCBC), a rowing club, was founded in 1859. It participates in the two annual Oxford bumps races, Eights Week and Torpids. In recent history, the MCBC men&#x27;s rowers won Eights Week between 2004 and 2007, and the Torpids most recently in 2008 (for the men&#x27;s rowers) and 2016 (women&#x27;s). As well as the MCBC, Magdalen College is represented by teams in football, hockey, rugby, netball, cricket, lacrosse, squash and pool, amongst others.

===College stamp===
A college stamp was issued in the 1960s and the 1970s to prepay local delivery of mail by the college porters. It was short-lived and only a few stamps exist. One on cover is known and is detailed in the &quot;Great Britain Philatelic Society Journal&quot;.

==Notable members==

===Politics===

Magdalen College has taught members of several royal families. These include king Edward VIII, who attended while Prince of Wales from 1912 to 1914, after which he left without graduating; Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, the king of Bhutan, who read for an MPhil in politics in 2000; and crown prince Al-Muhtadee Billah, first in line to the throne of Brunei, who enrolled in the Foreign Service Programme (now known as the Diplomatic Studies Programme) in 1995 under an assumed name.

Among the political figures taught at Magdalen was cardinal Thomas Wolsey, who studied theology. He graduated at 15, uncommonly early even for the time, but remained in Oxford for further study and eventually became a fellow of Magdalen. Wolsey rose from humble origins to become lord chancellor and the archbishop of York, obtaining great political power and becoming adviser to king Henry VIII. Wolsey left a lasting legacy in Oxford by founding Cardinal College, which Henry VIII would complete and refound as Christ Church after Wolsey&#x27;s fall from power.

More recent Magdalen alumni to become politicians include Malcolm Fraser, former prime minister of Australia, and John Turner, former prime minister of Canada. Many members of the UK Parliament have been alumni of Magdalen. In the current House of Commons sit alumni Alex Chalk, Jeremy Hunt and John Redwood. In the House of Lords sit alumni William Hague, Baron Hague of Richmond, former leader of the Conservative Party; David Lipsey, Baron Lipsey; Dido Harding, Baroness Harding of Winscombe; John Hutton, Baron Hutton of Furness; Michael Jay, Baron Jay of Ewelme; Matt Ridley, 5th Viscount Ridley; and Stewart Wood, Baron Wood of Anfield, former tutorial fellow.

The political success of Magdalen alumni was notable in 2010, when 5 out of the 22 ministers in the cabinet had attended Magdalen.

===Arts===
====Literature====

Joseph Addison, for whom Addison&#x27;s walk is named, was a Fellow of Magdalen during the 17th century. He is known for his play &quot;Cato, a Tragedy&quot; based on the life of Cato the Younger at the end of the Roman Republic. Popular with the American Founding Fathers, the play may have served as a literary inspiration for the American Revolution.

The 19th-century poet, playwright, and aesthete Oscar Wilde read greats at Magdalen from 1874 to 1878. During this time, he won the university&#x27;s Newdigate Prize and graduated with a double first. After his time at Magdalen, he became famous for his works including the novel &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; and the play &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;.

Wilde began an affair in 1891 with Alfred Douglas, who was then himself a student at Magdalen. The disapproval of Douglas&#x27;s father over Wilde&#x27;s relationship with his son led to Wilde&#x27;s prosecution and conviction in 1895 for &quot;gross indecency&quot;, that is to say, homosexual behaviour, and a sentence to two years&#x27; hard labour. Wilde described &quot;the two great turning-points in my life were when my father sent me to Oxford, and when society sent me to prison&quot;. After his release from prison, Wilde moved to France and spent the last three years of his life in poverty. He was posthumously pardoned in 2017 under Turing&#x27;s Law.

The prolific author Compton Mackenzie, who wrote over one hundred novels, plays, and biographies, read modern history at Magdalen. He is known for his fiction, including &quot;Sinister Street&quot;—which features St. Mary&#x27;s College, Oxford as a stand-in for Magdalen—and &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot;. Compton Mackenzie co-founded the Scottish National Party and was knighted in 1952.

C. S. Lewis, writer and alumnus of University College, was a fellow and English tutor at Magdalen for 29 years, from 1925 to 1954. Lewis was one of the Inklings, an informal writing society that also included J. R. R. Tolkien and would meet in Lewis&#x27;s rooms at Magdalen. Under Lewis&#x27;s tutelage was the future Poet Laureate John Betjeman. Though Betjeman failed the maths portion of the entrance exams, he was offered a place to read English on the strength of his poetry, which had impressed the President of Magdalen and former Professor of Poetry Thomas Herbert Warren. Lewis and Betjeman had a difficult relationship and Betjeman struggled academically. Betjeman left having failed to obtain a degree in 1928, but was made a doctor of letters by the university in 1974.

Seamus Heaney, who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995, was a fellow of Magdalen from 1989 to 1994.

====Theatre====

The director Peter Brook is both an alumnus and honorary fellow of Magdalen. He was described in 2008 as &quot;our greatest living theatre director&quot;. Fellow director Katie Mitchell read English at Magdalen, and is known for her collaborations with Martin Crimp. In 2017, she received the President&#x27;s Medal of the British Academy for her work in contemporary theatre and opera, and she has been described as British theatre&#x27;s &quot;king in exile&quot;.

====Music====
In 1957, the organist and composer Bernard Rose was appointed Magdalen&#x27;s Informator Choristarum, choir master. Among his students were Harry Christophers, a composer and an artistic director for the Handel and Haydn Society who was an academical clerk and later honorary Fellow at Magdalen; and Dudley Moore, comedic actor and jazz musician, who studied at Magdalen on an organ scholarship.

Andrew Lloyd Webber, Baron Lloyd-Webber, composer of musicals including &quot;Evita&quot; and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, studied history at Magdalen for a term in 1965, before dropping out to pursue music at the Royal College of Music. Andrew Lloyd Webber has received a number of awards for his work, including a lifetime achievement Tony Award.

===Humanities===

Hormuzd Rassam, the native Assyriologist, studied at Magdalen for 18 months between accompanying archaeologist Austen Henry Layard on his first and second expeditions. When Layard retired from archaeology, the British Museum appointed Rassam to continue on his own. Rassam made several important discoveries: in 1853 at Nineveh, Rassam discovered the clay tablets that contained the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;; in 1879 he discovered the Cyrus Cylinder in the ruins of Babylon; and in 1880–1881 he uncovered the city of Sippar. He was the first Middle Eastern archaeologist, but his contributions were dismissed by some of his contemporaries and by the end of his life, his name had been removed from plaques and visitor guides at the British Museum. Layard would describe him as &quot;one whose services have never been acknowledged&quot;.

The economist A. Michael Spence attended Magdalen on a Rhodes Scholarship, and graduated with a BA in mathematics in 1968. In 2001, he shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on &quot;analyses of markets with asymmetric information&quot;. He is an honorary fellow at Magdalen.

Novelist and Spanish anti-fascist Ralph Winston Fox studied modern languages at Magdalen College, where he graduated from in 1922 with a first class honours. Fox was best known for being the biographer of both Genghis Khan and Vladimir Lenin, and for being killed while fighting against Hitler backed fascists during the Spanish Civil War.

Philosopher A. C. Grayling read for his DPhil at Magdalen, completing his studies in 1981. In 2011, he founded the New College of the Humanities. An analytic philosopher, Grayling is known for his criticism of religion, including in his 2013 book &quot;The God Argument&quot;, and his arguments for voting reform, as in his 2017 book &quot;Democracy and Its Crises&quot;.

Niall Ferguson, a well-known historian, also studied at Magdalen.

===Sciences===

Magdalen counts among its alumni several recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Howard Florey was an Australian pharmacologist who studied at Magdalen on a Rhodes Scholarship, graduating in 1924. He shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945 for the development of penicillin. Peter Medawar read for a BA in zoology at Magdalen, receiving a first, and later for a DPhil, supervised by Florey. His research into tissue grafting and immune rejection led to the discover of acquired immune tolerance and became the basis of organ transplantation. For this work, he shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Like Florey before him, Australian neurophysiologist John Eccles also came to Magdalen on a Rhodes Scholarship, where he read for his DPhil. He was taught by an earlier neurophysiologist who received the Nobel in 1932, Charles Scott Sherrington, who held the Waynflete Professorship in Physiology at Magdalen. In 1963 Eccles received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research into synapses. Eccles was also known for his contributions to philosophy, writing on the mind-body problem and becoming an honorary member of the American Philosophical Society.

Peter J. Ratcliffe held the Nuffield Professorship of Clinical Medicine between 2003 and 2006, and is still a supernumerary fellow at Magdalen. He shared the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the oxygen sensing of cells. Other former Nuffield Professors of Clinical Medicine include Sir David Weatherall, who founded the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine in 1989, and Sir John Bell, who is also an alumnus of the college. The current holder of the chair is Richard Cornall, who was appointed in 2019.

Two Fellows of Magdalen have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics: Erwin Schrödinger in 1933, while he was a fellow; and Anthony James Leggett KBE in 2003, who had been a Fellow from 1963 to 1967.

Due to Magdalen&#x27;s close relationship with Oxford&#x27;s Botanic Garden and as the home of the Sherardian Chair of Botany, Magdalen has been associated with many accomplished botanists. Historic Sherardian Professors include John Sibthorp, in whose name the Sibthorpian Professorship of Rural Economy, later known as the Sibthorpian Professorship of Plant Sciences, was founded; and Charles Daubeny, who also held the Aldrichian Chair of Chemistry and founded the Daubeny laboratory. The Sherardian Chair has been held since 2022, by Lars Østergaard, who studies how molecular signalling mechanisms evolve to affect plant development.

Likewise, many distinguished scientists have held Waynflete Professorships at Magdalen. These include the mathematician J. H. C. Whitehead, who held the Waynflete Professorship of Pure Mathematics between 1947 and 1960. During this time, he was also the president of the London Mathematical Society, which established the Whitehead and Senior Whitehead prizes in his honour. He is remembered for his fundamental contributions to topology. The chair was held from 1984 until he retired in 2006 by Daniel Quillen, who received the Fields Medal for his work in algebraic K-theory. It is currently held by Ben Green.
