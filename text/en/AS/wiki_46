==History==
The land that would become the town of Harrah had its first settler, Louis Navarre, in the 1870s. Navarre, was a member of the Potawatomi people who had signed an 1867 treaty to sell their Kansas lands in order to purchase lands in Native Territory with the proceeds. They also became citizens of the United States and thus became known as the Citizen Potawatomi.
In 1890, Navarre and the Citizen Potawatomi participated, unwillingly, in the allotment process implemented through the Dawes Act of 1887. With this Act, the Citizen Potawatomi people were forced to accept individual allotments. In the Land Run of 1891, the remainder of the Potawatomi reservation in Oklahoma was opened up to non-Indian settlement, with about of the reservation given away by the government to settlers.

Frank Harrah, for whom the town is named, purchased from Louis Navarre&#x27;s allotment in April 1898 and early settlers included a large number of Polish immigrants. More than two million Poles entered American ports between 1897 and 1913, and the immigrants formed small communities around Choctaw Nation coal mines.

==Transportation==
Luther is located northeast of Oklahoma City on Oklahoma State Highway 66, formerly U.S. 66. Like many towns between Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Luther was bypassed by opening of the Turner Turnpike in 1953. After decades of planning, a new interchange 11 miles (18 km) east of I-35 was opened at Hogback Road south of Luther in 2011, granting more commuter access between Luther and Oklahoma City.

<text>Midwest City is a city in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, United States, and a part of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the population was 58,409, making it the eighth largest city in the state.

The city was developed in response to talk of an air field being located nearby and named for the Tinker Air Force Base&#x27;s original designation as the Midwest Air Depot. The city suffered damage during two tornadoes, the first in May 1999 and the second on May 8, 2003.

== History ==
W.P. &quot;Bill&quot; Atkinson bought land in the area that would become Midwest City after hearing speculation that an air field was going to be built nearby. The city, which was incorporated on March 11, 1943, was named for the air field&#x27;s original designation as the Midwest Air Depot. When Major General Clarence L. Tinker of Pawhuska, Oklahoma became the first American general killed in World War II (June 7, 1942) near Wake Island, the airfield was renamed in his honor.

Seward Mott, the director of the Federal Housing Administration&#x27;s Land Planning Division, helped design the city, gaining national print and broadcast attention, and it became a model for postwar community development. The city incorporated the Mishak community of Czech and German immigrants that had formed in what now is the southeast part of the city.

In 1947, returning veteran Nicholas Harroz opened Nick&#x27;s Brett Drive Grocery, which later became Crest Discount Foods, which is now one of the largest discount chains in the Oklahoma City metro area. Soon after its opening, Midwest City citizens opted for a charter-council-city manager form of government to better manage their rapid growth.

Midwest City&#x27;s regional hospital was dedicated October 6, 1962, built with the use of bond money. Voters also approved the creation of a junior college district in 1968. Oscar Rose Junior College opened its doors to students in 1970 and is now known as Rose State College. The Heritage Park Mall opened in 1978 on North Air Depot and was a prime shopping area in the city for several decades. The first Sam&#x27;s Club was opened in Midwest City on April 7, 1983.

In the early 1970s, the Glenwood Addition subdivision, just north of the TAFB runway, was purchased from individual owners with funds raised in a county-wide bond election after plane crashes in the area killed several civilians and military crewmen. 835 homes were moved and an elementary school was closed down. The former subdivision is fenced off and used as storage and training exercises for TAFB personnel.

Portions of Midwest City particularly northwest of Tinker Air Force Base sustained extreme damage from a violent tornado that swept through the southern and eastern areas of the Oklahoma City Metro on May 3, 1999. While it produced F5 damage in South Oklahoma City, damage in Midwest City was rated high-end F4 (although F5 was considered), with numerous destroyed homes and three fatalities. Another strong tornado struck almost exactly the same area four years later on May 8, 2003.

City officials worked to revitalize S.E. 29th Street in the early 21st century, leading to the development of a new Town Center Plaza shopping area that faces Interstate 40 and Tinker Air Force Base. The Town Center Plaza development replaced an aging, largely deserted Atkinson Plaza shopping center. In 2003, the Reed Center, a convention center, was built. Meanwhile, the Heritage Park Mall has slowly dwindled, becoming an issue of contention in the 2010 mayoral race.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The city&#x27;s elevation is 1,157 feet above sea level.

The city is located in Oklahoma County and the area is known for low hills and two species of blackjack oak and post oak. Midwest City also falls into an ecological region known as the Cross Timbers, and the Frontier Country tourism region

=== Climate ===
Midwest City has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;).

== Demographics ==

== Economy ==
Midwest City&#x27;s economic base is heavily dependent upon Federal tax dollars via Tinker Air Force Base, the largest single-site employer in Oklahoma. Other large employers include the Midwest Regional Medical Center and aerospace industry businesses affiliated with the base. The General Motors Oklahoma City Assembly plant was another major employer from its opening in 1979 until its closure in February 2006. GM closed the plant as part of a cost-savings measure. The property was later acquired by Oklahoma County and leased to Tinker Air Force Base for $1/year. Tinker renamed the facility the Tinker Aerospace Complex.

During World War II, the Midwest City Douglas Aircraft Company Plant constructed more than half of the 10,000 C-47 Skytrain U.S. Army cargo planes. The plant cost $24 million and rolled out its first C-47s in March 1943. Some 38,000 Oklahomans labored at the plant, the majority of them women. The plant closed on August 17, 1945, and was redesignated Building 3001 and transferred to the Oklahoma City Air Technical Service Command on November 1, 1945 and is now the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center.

== Arts and culture ==
Midwest City is home to a four-star 18-hole municipal golf course, a 9-hole municipal golf course, a swimming pool, splash park, and several urban parks. The nearby base hosts an annual Star-Spangled Salute each summer. The Juneteenth Midwest City Family Festival began in 2023 commemorating the national Juneteenth holiday. Rose State College hosts Global Oklahoma each year on the first Saturday in October.

When Midwest City&#x27;s founder and developer, W. P. &quot;Bill&quot; Atkinson, passed away in 1999, he left his 1955 mansion in trust for the community&#x27;s enjoyment and historical appreciation. Today, the Atkinson Heritage Center at N.E. 10th and Midwest Blvd. is owned by the Rose State College Foundation and maintained by the college. The 8,000 sq. ft. historic home, preserved in its original design when Atkinson was anticipating a run for governor, is available for free tours by appointment. To serve the community and help financially support the historic property, the house conference room and the 1951 pony barn are available for event rentals.

== Education ==
Midwest City is within the boundaries of multiple school districts. The largest portion is within Mid-Del School District, and includes Midwest City High School, Carl Albert High School, Midwest City Middle School, Carl Albert Middle School and numerous elementary schools. The district also includes a post-secondary school, the Mid-Del Technology Center. Rose State College, a two-year community college, is also located in the city.

The school district was initially housed in prefabricated hutments and began with a high school and two grade schools that were precursors to the Sooner and Soldier Creek elementary schools.

Other parts of Midwest City are in Choctaw/Nicoma Park Schools, Oklahoma City Public Schools (OKCPS), and Crutcho Public School. Zoned schools of the OKCPS part include Willow Brook Elementary School (PreKindergarten-Grade 1), Spencer Elementary School (grades 2-4), Rogers Intermediate School (grades 5-6), and Star Spencer Mid-High School.

<text>Nichols Hills is a city in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, United States, and a part of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. The population was 3,870 as of the 2020 census, a 4.3% increase from 2010.

==History==
The 1,280 acres now known as Nichols Hills were developed as an exclusive residential area by Dr. G.A. Nichols in 1929. Between 1907 and 1929, Dr. Nichols, an Oklahoma City real estate pioneer, developed the University, Paseo Arts District, Military Park, Central Park, Winans, University Place, Gatewood, Harndale, Nichols University Place and Lincoln Terrace neighborhoods of Oklahoma City and designed the city of Nicoma Park, Oklahoma.

By 1928, Dr. Nichols saw many Oklahoma City residential neighborhoods being encroached by the Oklahoma City Oil Field and industrial districts. Recognizing the importance of protecting home owners, Dr. Nichols developed Nichols Hills by placing restrictions on undesirable commercial activity while at the same time comprehending the need for commercial shopping districts within the city. Dr. Nichols hired Hare and Hare, a Kansas City, Missouri landscape architecture firm known for its landscape designs for Kansas City&#x27;s Country Club Plaza and Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, to design the city in such a way as to follow the natural terrain of the countryside. The distinctive curving streets, named after English towns, were punctuated by small and large parks, two golf courses, bridle paths, a polo field, a club house, and tennis courts located throughout the city. Commercial districts were located by Dr. Nichols on the perimeter of the city. Nichols Hills was founded as a municipality in September 1929 and grew when Dr. Nichols dedicated additional property to the city.

During the early 1930s, The Great Depression took its toll on Nichols Hills’ finances and large investors in Nichols Hills&#x27; property became delinquent on their taxes. Nichols Hills petitioned Oklahoma City for annexation, but was refused. The refusal awakened the citizens of Nichols Hills, who thereafter embarked on a capital and beautification campaign that ultimately led to significant manor and upscale residential development after World War II.

By 1950, and after its failure to annex Nichols Hills, Oklahoma City began annexing the land surrounding Nichols Hills including some property which was originally platted by Dr. Nichols as part of Nichols Hills. Nichols Hills is now surrounded entirely by Oklahoma City on the south, east and west, and The Village on the north. In 1959, thwarting a potential annexation from Oklahoma City, the first city charter was formed. Since its inception, Nichols Hills has maintained strict land use restrictions and zoning ordinances.

Known for its quality housing, Nichols Hills and its citizens maintain parks running throughout the city. The city is home to the Oklahoma City Golf and Country Club which was designed by Perry Maxwell.

==Geography==

The school served first- through 12th-grade students, and according to Dr. Donnie Nero, the school was nurturing and enriching, but also tough. &quot;Those teachers those educators made sure that we focused on being the best that we possibly could be so there wasn&#x27;t a lot of time for foolishness or time to waste,&quot; said Nero. The school featured some of the best and brightest Black teachers, such as civil rights leader Clara Luper, and the Rev. W.B. Parker, pastor of nearby St. James Baptist Church. Dunjee School closed in 1972, devastating the community of Spencer.

The residents of the Dunjee area had long suffered at the hand of segregation in Oklahoma. Before 1963, it was part of the Choctaw school system. After years of substandard support from the City of Choctaw, they fought to be integrated into the Oklahoma City school system and won. However, in 1972, the school board closed all Dunjee schools and began bussing as part of the mandated laws of desegregation. The community was stunned.

Because of desegregation, Dunjee closed in 1972, a move that in many eyes damaged the Spencer community. When the school&#x27;s doors shut for good, &quot;it devastated this community,&quot; said Theotis Payne. In 2012, a fire causing $250,000 in damage made the school uninhabitable.

==Controversy==
In 2013, the City of Spencer came under fire after several officials affiliated with the city were accused of embezzling funds; this was perpetrated by three previous employees of the city. An estimated $6,200 in funds were missing from the payroll system, and the three employees were shortly charged with embezzlement.

<text>Woodlawn Park is a town in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, United States, and a part of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area. The population was 161 at the 2000 census.

==History==
An incorporated town in Oklahoma County, Woodlawn Park is one of several urban islands surrounded by other towns of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. Woodlawn Park lies within the city of Bethany, which is itself surrounded by Oklahoma City. Originally the area was the farm of Frank Levi Braniger, who acquired land in Council Grove Township with, or soon after, the Land Run of 1889. In 1923 one of Braniger&#x27;s sons subdivided a heavily wooded part of the property into residential lots. This became Woodlawn Park, a rectangle of .128 square miles (approximately eighty-one acres), measuring one-half mile east–west and one-quarter mile north–south. It is bounded by Council Road on the west, Glade Avenue on the east, NW 36th Street on the south, and NW 39th Street on the north. Within the boundaries, between NW 37th and NW 38th streets lies a long park, the center of the town. A few homes were constructed in the late 1920s, but most of the development occurred in the late 1940s and through the 1950s.

Incorporation was accomplished in July 1952 as Bethany began to envelop the neighborhood. The 1960 census recorded 129 inhabitants.

After that, corn, cotton, pecans, and stock raising became important local industries, but Beggs went into a gradual decline, going from an official population of 2,327 in 1920 to 1,531 in 1930 and 1,107 in 1970.

==In popular culture==
Beggs attracted national attention in the late 1970s when public pay phones offering calls for only five cents had long since been phased out across the country, but Beggs still had them. In the 21st century, pay phones of any cost began to be phased out across the country by AT&amp;T in 2007 and Verizon in 2011. But as of mid-2022, Beggs still has nickel public pay phones, maintained by the Beggs Telephone Company.

Beggs features prominently in &quot;The Great War: American Front&quot;, the second volume of the Southern Victory alternate history novels by author Harry Turtledove.

Beggs was one of the filming sites for principal photography on Season One of the FX comedy series &quot;Reservation Dogs&quot; from filmmaker Sterlin Harjo, which concerns four Native American teens in rural Oklahoma.

<text>Henryetta is a city in Okmulgee County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 5,640 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Hugh Henry established a ranch on Creek Nation land in 1885. He soon found a deposit of coal, which he began using to fuel the forge at his ranch. Discovery of more coal deposits in the large Henryetta Coal Formation attracted several railroads to develop these mines. A settlement named Furrs grew up around the mines. The name changed to Henryetta when a post office opened on August 28, 1900.

At statehood in 1907, Henryetta had 1,051 residents. The economy was based on agriculture, coal, natural gas and oil. In 1909, the area had 14 coal mines, producing 65,000 tons per month. By 1910, the population had grown to 1,671. The town added a broom factory, several brick factories and a bottling plant during the 1920s. By the time of the 36th annual report of the Department of Mines and Minerals in 1943, combined yearly production by Acme Coal Company, Atlas Coal Company, Ben Hurr Coal Company, Starr Coal Company, and Wardin-Pullen Coal Company—all of Henryetta—was over 600,000 tons.

Henryetta&#x27;s manufacturing base continued to expand. Pittsburgh Plate Glass (PPG) built a plate glass window plant in Henryetta in 1929–30, employing 900 people and claiming to be the largest west of the Mississippi River. The factory closed in 1974, but was purchased and refitted for making glass containers, and continues in operation by Anchor Glass Container.

Eagle-Picher placed a massive zinc smelting facility in the Spelter City area of town, which continued through the 1960’s. The company also employed more than 700 people at its plant that extracted the rare metal germanium. The plant has since closed and become a Superfund cleanup site.

Besides Anchor Glass, current employers include the international oilfield-services company Shawcor; Henryetta Pallet, a regional wood pallet manufacturer; and, G&amp;H Decoy, a waterfowl decoy manufacturer since 1934.

On May 1, 2023, seven people were killed in a mass murder in Henryetta, allegedly by Jesse McFadden, found as one of the deceased.

<text>Morris is a city in Okmulgee County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,299 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The community began as a cattle stop on the Ozark and Cherokee Central Railway (later the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway, commonly known as the &quot;Frisco&quot;), which ran between Muskogee and Okmulgee. The post office was established here on January 4, 1904.

The townsite was platted in 1904 by L. R. Kershaw, who was an attorney and an immigration agent for the Frisco. He named the town after H. E. Morris, a Frisco executive. Many of the street names in Morris are named after towns that were familiar to Kershaw from his home state of Illinois. Kershaw was also the founder of two of the earliest banks in Morris, Indian Territory: The Farmer&#x27;s State Bank of Morris in 1905 and the First National Bank of Morris in 1907. Morris&#x27;s later history includes bank robberies, the most talked about being those by Charles Arthur &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; Floyd, who was popular in the Morris area.


The &quot;Morris News&quot;, a newspaper founded in 1910, has continued publication into the 20th century.

The large early growth in Morris&#x27;s history came from mineral extraction. Coal lay close to the surface in the area around Morris, and an oil boom developed around the Morris Pool. In more recent times, ranching and farming in the area have aided the town&#x27;s economy.

A tornado struck Morris on April 26, 1984. It killed nine people and destroyed the entire business section, as well as about one half of the housing.

<text>Okmulgee is a city in the Tulsa metropolitan area and the county seat of Okmulgee County in Oklahoma, United States. The name is from the Muskogee word &quot;okimulgi,&quot; which means &quot;boiling waters&quot;. The site was chosen because of the nearby rivers and springs. Okmulgee is 38 miles south of Tulsa and 13 miles north of Henryetta via US-75.

==History==
Okmulgee has been the capital of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation since 1868, when it was founded following the Civil War. The Creek Nation began restoring order after that conflict. They had allied with the Confederacy during the war and needed to make a new peace treaty with the United States afterward as a result. They passed a new constitution and elected Samuel Checote as their first principal chief after the war.

In 1869, a post office (originally spelled Okmulkee) was established in the town, with Captain Frederick B. Severs appointed as the first postmaster. The name of the post office was officially changed to the present spelling on November 15, 1883. For seven years, beginning December 20, 1870, Okmulgee was the seat of government of all of what would become the State of Oklahoma, except for the Panhandle.

Okmulgee became a transportation center. The St. Louis, Oklahoma and Southern Railway (later absorbed by the St. Louis – San Francisco Railway or &quot;Frisco&quot;) reached Okmulgee in 1900; this route still remains and is now operated by the BNSF Railway. The Shawnee, Oklahoma and Missouri Coal and Railway (also later acquired by the Frisco) was built from Muskogee to Okmulgee in 1902-03, and lasted until abandoned in 1973. And, the shortline Coalton Railway, later called the Okmulgee Northern Railway, operated between Okmulgee and Deep Fork carrying coal from the producing areas around Schulter, Coalton and Dewar from 1916 to 1964. Railroad projects which tried unsuccessfully to reach Okmulgee include the Oklahoma-Southwestern Railway, which planned to build from Bristow to Okmulgee but only made it to Nuyaka; the Kansas, Okmulgee and Gulf Railroad, which planned a line from Kansas City through Okmulgee to a point on the Red River, but never got off the ground; and, the Kansas, Oklahoma Central and Southwestern Railway which had Congressional authorization to build a branch from Bartlesville through Okmulgee to Sherman, Texas, but was bought out by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway before construction began.

The arrival of the railways triggered a building boom. By the time of Oklahoma statehood in 1907, the town had 2,322 residents and was named as the seat of Okmulgee County.

Coal mined in the Henryetta area and agriculture were the basis of the early economy. Discovery of oil at nearby Morris in 1907 stimulated expansion of Okmulgee, and attracted several new industries to town. These included three glass factories, a bottle factory, and foundry and machine shops. Five local refineries were operational by the early 1920s.

These industries were a catalyst for growth: The population was 4,176 in the 1910 census, but the city boomed to approximately 35,000 people during the 1920s. A newspaper article from this era claimed Okmulgee had more millionaires per capita than anyplace else in Oklahoma. The Okmulgee Chamber of Commerce has said the town had more millionaires per capita than any other place in the entire country.

But decreasing oil production and lower prices, the coming of the Great Depression, and other factors caused the population to shrink to 17,097 by the 1930 census. The population then remained relatively stable for a time, increasing slightly to 18,317 by the 1950 census. In the postwar period, there was an urbanization shift of population toward larger cities and their suburbs because of job opportunities, and the city&#x27;s population declined again. The population at the 2020 census was 11,332, a loss of about 8% percent from the 2010 census figure of 12,321.

==Geography==
Okmulgee is located at (35.624558, -95.963254). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 33.8 square miles (33.2 km), all of its land. It is located in the heart of Oklahoma&#x27;s &quot;Green Country&quot;, in the North East Quadrant of Oklahoma. Okmulgee is 38 miles south of Tulsa and 13 miles north of Henryetta via US-75.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 11,332 people and 4,477 households, with an average of 2.37 persons per household. The population density was 657.6 people per square mile. The racial makeup of the city was 51.5% White, 16.6% African American, 18.5% Native American, 0.9% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 12.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.4% of the population.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 21.4% under the age of 18, and 15.1% who were 65 years of age or older. Females were 52.9% of the population.

The median household income, for the period 2016-2020 and in 2020 dollars, was $31,572. The per capita income for the city in the last 12 months, also for the period 2016–2020 and in 2020 dollars, was $19,564. About 24.3% are considered persons in poverty.

==Economy==
Along with coal mining, agriculture supported the early economy. Cotton, corn, feed grains, and forage were the main crops. Truck farming, dairying, and poultry raising were also important.

Discovery of the Morris and Lucky oil pools in 1907 brought prosperity to Okmulgee. It also attracted new manufacturing facilities to the city.

In the 21st century, the most important business sectors in Okmulgee are: construction, retail trade, health care &amp; social assistance, and accommodation &amp; food services. The Okmulgee area&#x27;s major employers include the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, Anchor Glass (plant is in Henryetta), Paccar Winch-Okmulgee, C.P. Kelco US Inc., Honeywell&#x27;s Callidus Technologies (facility is in Beggs), East Central Electric Cooperative, Covington Aircraft, G&amp;H Decoy (in Henryetta), and PolyVision. Dlubak Glass Oklahoma runs a glass recycling facility, while wood pallet producer Mid-America Pallet is operated by The Hodges Companies. Walmart operates a Supercenter in town.

===Native American government===
While the historical capitol of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation is the Creek Council House in downtown Okmulgee, the MCN&#x27;s modern headquarters is at Okmulgee Creek Nation Tribal Complex at U.S. Route 75 and Loop 56. Other MCN facilities in town include the College of the Muscogee Nation, a tribal college primarily for students seeking careers in the tribal sector, located at 2170 Raven Circle; One Fire Casino at 1901 Wood Dr; and, the Claude A.

The school site in 1943 was Glennan Military Hospital, constructed on land formerly belonging to the Creek Orphan Home. The hospital originally treated WWII American servicemen, but later served wounded POWs. In 1946 the site was sold to Oklahoma State Technical College to provide technical training for returning GIs. This evolved into the current OSUIT.

==Parks and recreation==
Recreational opportunities include Okmulgee Park and Dripping Springs Park, which offer RV and camping facilities. The parks also offer swimming, fishing, and boating opportunities through the adjacent Dripping Springs Lake, which has of shoreline and of water, and the separate Okmulgee Lake. The end of Okmulgee Lake features the Lake Okmulgee Dam Spillway Cascade, listed in the National Register of Historic Places in Okmulgee County, Oklahoma, which on occasions of heavy rains and high lake levels creates an intense man-made waterfall. Near Okmulgee is the Deep Fork National Wildlife Refuge. Established in 1993, this approximately of habitat for waterfowl along the Deep Fork River features opportunities for wildlife viewing such as along the Cussetah Bottoms Boardwalk, as well as fishing and certain archery, muzzle-loading, and small-game hunting opportunities.

Lake Eufaula, Oklahoma’s largest lake, is to the southeast.

==Historic buildings==

In November 1992, the Okmulgee Downtown Historic District (NRIS number 92001693) was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in Okmulgee County. The area is roughly bounded by Fourth Street, Eighth Street, Okmulgee Avenue and the Frisco tracks. In support of Okmulgee&#x27;s downtown, an organization has been formed called Okmulgee Main Street, one of the various national Main Street programs that aim to reenergize their respective downtowns and commercial districts through preservation-based economic development and community revitalization. This group is helping to propel the “Okmulgee Rising” movement that started in the city in 2014. The process is aided in part by tax incentives for preserving historic properties. Among the downtown structures is the Orpheum Theater at 210 W 7th St, which opened as the Cook Opera House on August 23, 1920 with 1,200-seat capacity. This is the finest and last surviving of three grand theatres formerly located in Okmulgee. The Orpheum&#x27;s architecture, which is an elegant derivation of Spanish Baroque Revival, includes a colorful lobby which is the finest example in Oklahoma of the interior use of polychrome terra cotta.

The historic Okmulgee County Courthouse, at 314 W. 7th, was built in 1916 and is also NRHP-listed.

The Creeks initially built a two-story log council house to serve as their capital. This building burned in 1878 and was replaced with the stone Creek Council House building that stands today. Ownership of the building changed over the years, but in November 2010 the City sold the building back to the tribe for $3.2 million. The building currently houses the Creek Council House Museum, with artifacts and exhibits about the history of the Muscogee tribe and the arts and crafts of other Native American tribes. The building is NRHP-listed.

The Okmulgee Public Library, 218 S. Okmulgee Avenue, completed in 1921, is a good example of Georgian Revival architecture, and is NRHP-listed.

In 2012 the Muscogee (Creek) Nation purchased the Okmulgee Golf Club, also known as the Okmulgee Country Club, at 1400 S. Mission Street, an NRHP-listed location complete with the original 1920 golf course and the 1925 clubhouse built using locally sourced limestone. The MCN intends to turn that facility into a cultural center where events can be held.

Historic churches include First Baptist Central Church, an historically black church built in 1915 and NRHP-listed; Eastside Baptist Church, built in 1921 and NRHP-listed; and, St. Anthony&#x27;s, a Spanish Colonial Revival-style Catholic church built in 1927 and NRHP-listed.

Historic mansions remaining from the boom days include the Okmulgee Elks Lodge at 701 S. Mission, being a 7-acre site that was originally the Wilson Mansion from 1922; the Southern Mansion just off US-75 on Banyan Road, being the 1928 home for Creek orphan Katie Fixico; the Kennedy Mansion from 1904 at 502 S. Okmulgee Avenue, which is NRHP-listed; and, the &quot;Historic Okmulgee Mansion&quot; at 1700 E. 6th Street, originally the stately 1921 Italian Renaissance home built for oil producer Eugene R. Black, now law offices.

The Nuyaka Mission site is located on McKeown Rd. (aka E0945 Rd) just off N 120 Rd (aka N3850 Rd) approximately 15.7 miles west of the intersection of U.S. Route 75 and State Highway 56 (aka 6th Street) in Okmulgee, and is NRHP-listed.

==Events==
Okmulgee is known for its annual Okmulgee Invitational Rodeo and Festival, which is the nation&#x27;s oldest African-American rodeo and one of the state&#x27;s longest running rodeos.

The Okmulgee Farmer&#x27;s Market has been running every year since 2013, and is open once a week (sometimes twice weekly) from May to October.

Okmulgee has an annual Pecan Festival. At the festival in 1989, a record was set for what was then the largest pecan pie in the world, being 40’ in diameter and using over sixteen-and-a-half tons of ingredients. A mural in town commemorates the event.

The Okmulgee County Fair is held annually (typically in September) at the Okmulgee County Fairgrounds, and includes commercial booths, exhibits, livestock shows, livestock judging, a horse show and cattle displays.

Other family-oriented festivals and special events occur on a monthly schedule throughout the year, including the OrangeFest, Harvest Spoon Chili Fest, Muscogee Creek Nation Festival, Eats and Beats, and the bi-annual Airfest.

==Transportation==
Okmulgee is served by U.S. Route 75, a major national north/south artery for much of its length, currently running from the Canada-US border at Noyes, Minn. to Dallas, Texas, as well as by U.S. Route 62, which runs from the Mexico-US border at El Paso, Texas to Niagara Falls, New York near the Canada-US border.

Okmulgee is in the 10-county region served by the KI BOIS Area Transit System (&quot;KATS&quot;), a low-cost public bus/van service established in 1983 to help communities, primarily in southeast Oklahoma, by providing access to Senior Citizen centers, groceries, medical services, and jobs. This includes transportation to certain out-of-town destinations such as Henryetta, Beggs, Preston, Morris, and Schulter. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation partners with KATS on certain on-demand transportation services; and, Muscogee (Creek) Nation Transit provides regularly-scheduled trolley-style bus services to various locations around the city. These services are not limited to tribal citizens.

The city has the Okmulgee Regional Airport (originally called the Okmulgee Municipal Airport), designated OKM by IATA Code and KOKM by ICAO Code. Construction of this airport was authorized in 1942 as a national defense project, and was completed on September 7, 1943. The main runway (18-36) is concrete-surfaced, 100&#x27; wide and 5,150&#x27; long. Effective July 1, 2015, the airport is managed by the Tulsa Airports Improvement Trust.

Commercial air transportation is available at Tulsa International Airport, about 47 miles to the north.

Rail freight service is provided by BNSF Railway.

==History==
Located approximately eight miles south of Okmulgee and six miles north of Henryetta in Okmulgee County, just off U.S. routes 75 and 62, the original name of the town may have been Winchell.

The post office built in August 1903 was named for Matt Schulter, said to be a resident of St. Louis, Missouri. Coal mining in the Henryetta Coal Formation was an important early industry in the area, and attracted many nationalities of European immigrants. Early Schulter, &quot;circa&quot; 1909, had three coal company offices, phone service, a school, a general store, and even a pool hall for its 200 residents. Later, the town benefitted from oil exploration, production, and refining. The town&#x27;s peak population may have been &quot;circa&quot; 1930, at 650 people.

<doc id="130471" wikidata="Q2911221" url="?curid=130471" title="Winchester, Oklahoma">
<text>Winchester is a town in Okmulgee County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 546 at the 2020 census, an increase of 5.8% from the figure of 516 recorded in 2010. It is a recently built residential community, having incorporated February 18, 1974.

This is not to be confused with the old settlement of Winchester in Woods County, Oklahoma near the Kansas border, west of the present-day U.S. Route 281 and west-southwest of Hardtner, Kansas.

==History==
Winchester began as a residential community on 2,500 acres of land acquired by William D. Crews in 1959. It was intended to attract people who were &quot;tired and frustrated&quot; with life in Tulsa. It incorporated February 18, 1974. By 1980, it had a population of 150. However, by 2000 it still had no retail businesses or municipal services. Telephone, mail, school, and fire-fighting services are supplied by the town of Beggs.

==Geography==
Winchester is located approximately south of downtown Tulsa. The town&#x27;s fenceline runs approximately from U.S. Route 75, a major national north/south artery, on the west side to approximately east of the highway, and from 241st St. in the north to Oklahoma State Highway 16 in the south. Winchester residents have a Beggs mailing address, but the town of Beggs is actually southwest of Winchester and on the opposite side of U.S. 75.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 4.5 square miles (11.7 km2), all land.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 424 people, 153 households, and 123 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 169 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 83.73% White, 0.71% African American, 6.37% Native American, 0.24% Asian, 2.83% from other races, and 6.13% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.60% of the population.

There were 153 households, out of which 31.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 68.0% were married couples living together, 6.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 19.6% were non-families. 17.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 3.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.77 and the average family size was 3.08.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 27.4% under the age of 18, 7.3% from 18 to 24, 30.0% from 25 to 44, 26.2% from 45 to 64, and 9.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 103.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.2 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $37,031, and the median income for a family was $49,444. Males had a median income of $34,792 versus $20,833 for females. The per capita income for the town was $14,614. About 4.0% of families and 10.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 2.0% of those under age 18 and 21.7% of those age 65 or over.

==In the news==
William D. Crews on behalf of the Green Country Racing Association applied to the Oklahoma Horse Racing Commission to build a $120 million pari-mutuel horse racetrack in the town, to be called Winchester Park, on December 16, 1983. However, that application was turned down twice, once in 1984 based on insufficient financing and unrealistic attendance and wagering projections, and finally in 1985 as incomplete.

Winchester again made the news in March 1989 when the Institute for the Study of American Wars (ISAW), a Delaware-based nonprofit organization, chose Winchester over competing sites in Oklahoma, Arizona, Pennsylvania and New Mexico for a proposed $150 million war museum complex. However, the selection was withdrawn in April after a disagreement regarding donation of the land. ISAW claimed the State of Oklahoma could not or would not follow through on an earlier pledge of immediate donation in fee of 300 acres of land, and was instead offering only a 200-year lease of the land and/or was demanding proof that ISAW had the funding to build the museum prior to transfer of the land. ISAW later admitted to having raised only $65,000. ISAW then selected the Phoenix area and on July 17, 1989, announced the exact site as a donated 300 acres of a 7,500-acre cotton farm between Phoenix and Tucson once owned by movie star John Wayne, known as John Wayne&#x27;s Red River Ranch, in Casa Grande, Arizona. In the end, the museum was never built in any location, and ISAW&#x27;s entity status was voided effective March 1, 1998, by the Delaware Secretary of State.

==Ordinances and land covenants==
The town&#x27;s website indicates Winchester is a &quot;restricted residential community&quot;; i.e., the town is subject to land covenants and zoning ordinances which restrict, among other things, mobile homes in many locations. At least one lawsuit to enforce the ordinances and covenants against a homeowner placing a mobile home in an unauthorized location has been successfully prosecuted.

<text>Barnsdall is a city in Osage County, Oklahoma, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 1,034.

==History==

The community was founded in 1905 and originally named Bigheart, for the Osage Chief James Bigheart. It was initially a 160-acre site along the Midland Valley Railroad in March 1905. The railroad opened Bigheart Station in September 1905 and the Bigheart Post Office opened in January 1906. The community was exempted from the Osage allotment, so lots could be sold to anyone. Lots were auctioned in May 1906. The first newspaper, the &quot;Bigheart Star&quot;, first appeared in 1906.

Joshua Cosden built the Southwest Refining Company oil refinery in 1910. He sold it to Stone and Webster of Boston, Massachusetts in 1917. The Barnsdall Oil Company had discovered the nearby Bigheart (later Barnsdall) oilfield in 1916. The Barnsdall Oil Company, bought the refinery in 1921. The community was renamed Barnsdall on January 1, 1922, in honor of Theodore N. Barnsdall.

Barnsdall experienced a tornado in April 1911, a major fire in March 1913 and a flood in September 1915. Despite these calamities, the population increased from 307 in 1910 to 2,099 in 1920. That proved to be the high point of population in the community.

Henry L. Doherty bought the holdings of Theodore N. Barnsdall, founder of Barnsdall Oil Company, in 1912. Barnsdall Refining Company renamed itself Bareco Oil Company in 1940. It ceased refining oil in 1946 and began producing microcrystalline waxes that year. Petrolite Corporation (later part of Baker Hughes) bought Bareco and continued to operate the plant. The business was sold to SK Capital in September 2020 and renamed NuCera Solutions; and, NuCera was sold in September 2022 to Chase Corporation. NuCera continued as operator until July 2024, when tornado damage lead to announcement of the plant&#x27;s phased shutdown.

The Midland Valley Railroad trackage both north and south of Barnsdall has been abandoned, the southern portion in 2000. At least some of the route south of Barnsdall has been converted into a rail trail.

<text>Burbank is a town in western Osage County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 141 at the 2010 census, a 9 percent decrease from the figure of 155 recorded in 2000.

==History==
Burbank was founded in 1903 on the Osage Reservation. The founder was Anthony &quot;Gabe&quot; Carlton, a mixed-blood Osage and a Chouteau family descendant, who owned the townsite and named it after the artist Elbridge Ayer Burbank (1858-1949) who spent his life painting the Indians of over 125 tribes.

Burbank had about 200 residents and an economy based on farming and ranching until May 1920 when E.W. Marland discovered petroleum northeast of the town. Burbank became a boom town, and other towns in the area such as Whizbang sprang up overnight to exploit the rich petroleum resources. The Burbank field was mostly located in Osage County but extended into Kay County. The Burbank field extended over an area about long and wide. Burbank quickly grew into a town of 3,000 people.

Several major petroleum companies participated in the boom of the Burbank Field. Leases of oil land were obtained from the Osage Indians, usually by auction under the &quot;Million Dollar Elm&quot; tree in Pawhuska, the county seat and capital of the Osage Indians. Colonel Ellsworth Walters was the auctioneer and more than a million dollars was often bid for the mineral rights to 160 acre (65 ha) tracts in the Burbank Field. Rich and famous oilmen such as Marland, Frank Phillips, L. E. Phillips, Waite Phillips, and William G. Skelly stood in the shade of the Elm tree and bid in the auctions. 
Oil production in the Burbank field expanded from 134,408 barrels in 1920 to a peak production of 26,206,741 barrels in 1923. Production dropped by one-half in 1926 and by 1930 the boom period was over. Burbank&#x27;s population dropped to 372 in 1930. The value of the 160 million barrels the Burbank field produced during its heyday was almost 286 million dollars.

The Osage tribe and its members received $45 million in royalties from the Burbank field in the 1920s. The Osage, unlike many tribes, had retained collective ownership of mineral rights on their former reservation. Osage with a full headright (those on the 1906 tribal roll) received up to $15,000 each annually in oil royalties, the equivalent of more than $150,000 in 2010 dollars. The Osage were the &quot;richest people in the world.&quot;

By 2002 the population of the community had decreased.

In previous eras a grocery store existed, as did two of each of the following: cinemas and hotels.

<doc id="130475" wikidata="Q2160527" url="?curid=130475" title="Fairfax, Oklahoma">
<text>Fairfax is a town in Osage County, Oklahoma, United States. The Osage Nation reservation is coterminous with the county. The population was 1,380 at the 2010 census, down 11.3 percent from the figure of 1,555 recorded in 2000. It was the home of the ballerinas Maria and Marjorie Tallchief.

==History==
When the Santa Fe Railway chose to go up Salt Creek valley and bypassed the village of Gray Horse (which continues to exist today as the home of one of the Osage tribe&#x27;s three major historic bands) the present day town of Fairfax was created. Local merchants, including Lew A. Wismeyer, moved buildings from Gray Horse and leased acres for a townsite. Wismeyer rejected the name Coda proposed by the railroad and convinced them to call the depot Fairfax after a hotel he had stayed at in Washington, D.C. The Osage tribe retained title to the townsite until March 3, 1905, when Congress provided for the land to be sold at public auction, with the proceeds credited to the tribe. Fairfax had 470 residents at the time of statehood in 1907. Fairfax is also the site of the majority of the Osage Indian Murders that took place in the 1920s in Osage County, Oklahoma. The murders occurred following the discovery of oil on the Osage Nation Reservation (coterminous with the county). At least 24 Osages were murdered in a plot masterminded by William Hale.

==Geography==
Fairfax is southwest of Pawhuska and southeast of Ponca City.

<text>Foraker is a town in Osage County, Oklahoma, United States. It was named for Ohio Senator Joseph B. Foraker. The Tallgrass Prairie Preserve is southeast of town. The official population peaked at 415 in 1910 and has declined steadily since 1930. The population was only 18 at the 2010 census, a 21.7 percent decline from 23 in 2000.

Foraker was listed as a ghost town in the 1977 book &quot;Ghost Towns of Oklahoma&quot;. The author, John Wesley Morris, quoted one long-time resident as saying: &quot;Stores gone, post office gone, train gone, school gone, oil gone, boys and girls gone – only thing not gone is graveyard and it git bigger.&quot;

==History==
Located in an area of rolling plains and tallgrass prairie, a post office was established at Foraker on February 13, 1903. The town began as a 160-acre tract platted by the U.S. Department of the Interior along the Midland Valley Railroad in 1905. By 1909, the town had a population of 500 as the area underwent a ranching and farming boom. Foraker had the amenities associated with older communities: sidewalks, a public park, and plans for an electric and water system and a substantial school building.

The agriculture boom subsided, but the town was briefly revitalized by discovery of the Burbank Oil Field in 1920, which made Foraker an oil industry equipment supply center. In 1922 the Osage Railway, one of the Muskogee Roads, was opened from Foraker to Shidler, ten miles away, making Foraker an oil shipping point. The population rose to about 2,000 in the early 1920s. The Osage County oil boom declined during the Great Depression, and with it Foraker&#x27;s fortunes. The population dropped. The Osage Valley railroad was abandoned in 1953 and the Midland Valley Railroad was abandoned in 1968. The town business district fell vacant. Foraker is now in a region dominated by large cattle ranches. A lonely and picturesque old cemetery in the prairie approximately one mile east of what remains of the town is the chief landmark.
The nearest post office is at Shidler.

==Geography==
Foraker is north and west of Pawhuska and north and east of Shidler.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 23 people, 10 households, and 6 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 13 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 73.91% White, 4.35% Native American, and 21.74% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.35% of the population.

There were 10 households, out of which 30.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.0% were married couples living together, and 40.0% were non-families. 40.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 20.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.30 and the average family size was 3.17.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 26.1% under the age of 18, 4.3% from 18 to 24, 30.4% from 25 to 44, 13.0% from 45 to 64, and 26.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.9 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $36,250, and the median income for a family was $63,333. Males had a median income of $38,750 versus $18,750 for females. The per capita income for the town was $20,079. None of the population and none of the families were below the poverty line.

The team had a 28-game winning streak at one point during its existence, but was disbanded due to the onset of the Great Depression. A screening of the movie &quot;Playground of the Native Son,&quot; based on the events of the team was screened on October 10, 2014, at Circle Cinema, Tulsa&#x27;s non-profit independent theater.

A medium security prison was constructed in Hominy at the price of $12.8 million and received its first inmates in August 1979. It was originally named the Jess Dunn Correctional Center, in honor of Warden Jess Dunn who had been shot and killed in 1941 by prisoners during an escape attempt. A 1977 joint resolution renamed the facility the Dick Conner Correctional Center. The facility reached its original design capacity of 400 during the spring of 1980.

The prison was severely damaged by a riot that took place on August 29 and 30, 1983. A riot proclamation was issued by then Governor George Nigh on August 30. The inmates torched the buildings adjacent to the kitchen and completely destroyed the library, school, and church area. All of this resulted in the death of an inmate and damages of $3 million. The first special session of the 39th Legislature re-appropriated nearly $2.5 million to fund reconstruction of the facility.

<text>Pawhuska (Osage: 𐓄𐓘𐓢𐓶𐓮𐓤𐓘, &quot;hpahúska&quot;, lit.: &quot;White Hair&quot;; Chiwere: &quot;Paháhga&quot;) is a city in and the county seat of Osage County, Oklahoma, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 2,984. It was named after the 19th-century Osage chief, &quot;Paw-Hiu-Skah&quot;, which means &quot;White Hair&quot; in English. The Osage tribal government, which opened offices in Pawhuska in 1872 when its reservation was established in Indian Territory, continues to be based in Pawhuska.

==History==
The town, originally known as Deep Ford, was established in 1872 with the reservation for the Osage Nation, part of Indian Territory. The Osage Indian Agency was located along Bird Creek. One of the three main bands of the tribe settled here. Traders followed, building stores during 1872 and 1873. Pawhuska&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Indian Herald&quot; (also known as &quot;Wah-Sha-She News.&quot;), was founded in 1875 by George Edward Tinker, an Osage who became the father of Clarence L. Tinker, highest-ranking Native American officer in the US Army. The first post office opened in 1876.

The Midland Valley Railroad reached Pawhuska in September 1905. By the time of statehood in 1907, the town population was 2,407.

The first Boy Scout troop is claimed to have been organized in Pawhuska in May 1909 by John F. Mitchell, a missionary priest from England sent to St. Thomas Episcopal Church by the Church of England. On Independence day weekend 2009, the Pawhuska Boy Scout troop celebrated its centennial with a mini-jamboree attended by over 300 Scouts from across the United States.

During the Osage oil boom of the 1910s and 1920s, Pawhuska was the site of big-money public auctions of oil and gas leases under the so-called “Million Dollar Elm” next to the Osage Council House. The population grew to 6,414 by 1920. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad extended its line from Owen, a community in Washington County, to Pawhuska in 1923. As the oil boom declined and the Great Depression set in, the population declined. The steady decline has continued to the present.

Minor league baseball came to Pawhuska briefly in the 1920s in the form of two teams: the Pawhuska Huskers, which operated from 1920 to 1921, and the Pawhuska Osages, which operated for part of the 1922 season before folding.

<text>Shidler is a city in Osage County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 328 in the 2020 census, a decline from the figure of 441 recorded in 2010.

==History==
Shidler was founded in December 1921 and named for Eugene S. Shidler, a Pawhuska banker and rancher. The town grew rapidly to a population of approximately 5,000 due to the discovery of petroleum nearby (see Whizbang) and the arrival of the Osage Railway (one of the Muskogee Roads) in February 1922. In that year, Shidler had 19 oil-well supply businesses and six plants manufacturing gasoline. Shidler had a reputation for lawlessness, with bank and highway robberies common. By the late 1920s, the oil boom had subsided and Shidler began to lose population. Shidler&#x27;s population in the 1930 census was 1,177 and the downward trend continued. Shidler today is a quiet farming and ranching community, although there is still some petroleum production in the area.

During World War II, citizens of Shidler actively lobbied to prevent the internment of the Yamamoto family from Shidler (see Internment of Japanese Americans). Due to the efforts of U.S. Senator Elmer Thomas, the internment order was lifted.

<text>Webb City is an unincorporated town in northwestern Osage County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 62 at the 2010 census, a 34.7 percent decline from the figure of 95 recorded in 2000. It was named for its founder, Horace Webb, on whose land the town was founded. The Webb City post office opened December 16, 1922.

==History==
Horace W. Webb, a native of Missouri, settled just south of Grainola, Oklahoma in 1910. He continued to purchase land and opened the area&#x27;s first school. The town of Webb City was incorporated on his land in September 1921. The post office opened in Webb City on December 16, 1922.

Webb City was located at the northern end of the Burbank Oil Field, discovered in 1920. All mineral rights in Osage County were owned by the Osage tribe of American Indians. The Osage Railway, one of the Muskogee Roads, built a line through the town in 1924 connecting Shidler and Lyman, Oklahoma. Although the oil find brought a degree of prosperity, Webb City never developed into a modern town. Water was scarce and there was no electricity. The business district had unpaved streets and most of the buildings were built of wood frame and false fronts.

The town began to decline in the late 1920s, as the oil boom faded. In 1928, it was heavily damaged by a tornado, and many of the businesses did not rebuild. The decline continued through the Great Depression. Its high school closed in 1944, and consolidated with the high school in Shidler. The elementary school closed in 1956, and consolidated with the elementary school in Shidler. The Osage Railway was abandoned in 1955.

The 1930 census (the first census taken in Webb City) showed 493 residents. The population declined thereafter.

<text>Wynona is an incorporated town in central Osage County, Oklahoma, United States. It was founded by a local Osage-Cherokee rancher, Antoine Rogers, in 1903. The population was 437 at the 2010 census, a 17.7 percent decline from 531 in 2000.

==History==
An Osage-Cherokee rancher, Antoine Rogers, settled in the area that would become the town of Wynona in 1871, after the Osage tribe had been removed from Kansas to Indian Territory by the U. S. Government. In 1903, the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway (also known as the MK&amp;T or Katy railroad) built a line across Rogers&#x27;s land. A store was built adjacent to the track, and that event is considered the establishment of Wynona, which soon became a cattle shipping point.

The Osage Townsite Company began development of the town in 1909. By the end of the year, the population grew from 20 to more than 150 residents. The first local newspaper, a weekly named the &quot;Wynona Enterprise&quot;, appeared in August 1909.

Oil was discovered near Wynona in 1914, and led to the creation of Wynona Oil and Gas Company. This caused an influx of new residents to support the local oil industry. Wynona&#x27;s 1920 census reported 2,749 inhabitants. Wynona remained important for its agriculture and ranching business. Ranchers diversified into producing hogs, poultry and dairy products. However, the town failed to put in electric service and paved streets, causing some businessmen to move elsewhere. The end of the boom in Osage County oil production and the onset of the Great Depression caused the population to decline sharply to 1,171 in 1930 and to 652 in 1960. The MK&amp;T abandoned its rail line in 1977.

On March 22, 1946, the town was struck by a violent tornado, estimated by tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis to have been F4 intensity on the Fujita scale. The tornado destroyed a power plant, 15 homes, and damaged ten other homes as it travelled along a short path of with a width of . A piece of machinery was carried for by the tornado. Damage was estimated at $150,000 (1946 USD).

<text>Afton is a town in northeast Oklahoma in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 734 at the time of the 2020 United States census.

==History==
Afton developed in this part of the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory after the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad (later the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway, or Frisco) built tracks through the area to Vinita in 1871. Regarding the town name, Oklahoma historian George Shirk states that a Scottish railroad surveyor, Anton Aires, named the town Afton after his daughter, while others have claimed the name comes from Robert Burns&#x27;s poem, &quot;Flow Gently Sweet Afton.&quot; In either case, Afton Aires&#x27; name and the Burns poem honor the River Afton in Scotland.

A post office was established in Afton during 1886. The 1900 census showed a population of 606. In 1901, the Kansas City, Fort Scott and Memphis Railroad, which soon became part of the Frisco system, constructed another line through the town, creating a shorter route to Kansas City, and causing another spurt of population growth. The town became a Frisco division point and shipping center for the surrounding agricultural area. In 1910, Afton&#x27;s population was 1,276; the town had two schools, a waterworks, two hotels, two banks, a brick and tile plant, a creamery, a newspaper, mills and grain elevators. The population peaked at 1,518 in 1920, but a depression after World War I caused a drop to 1,219 in 1930.Today there is a bank a gas station, buffalo ranch, a pecan factory, a motel, a repair shop, and a dollar general.

<doc id="130487" wikidata="Q3249022" url="?curid=130487" title="Cardin, Oklahoma">
<text>Cardin is a ghost town in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 150 at the 2000 census, but declined all the way to a population of 3 at the 2010 census in April 2010. By November of 2010, the population of the town was listed as zero.

A former center of zinc and lead mining in northeastern Oklahoma, the town is located within the Tar Creek Superfund site designated in 1983 because of extensive environmental contamination. The vast majority of its residents accepted federal buyout offers of their properties, and the town&#x27;s population officially had declined to zero in November 2010.

==History==

===Early history===
When it was founded as a mining town in 1913, this was first known as Tar Creek, after a stream in the area. In 1918, William Oscar Cardin (Quapaw), and his wife, Isa (Wade) Cardin, had his 40-acre allotment platted and recorded with the county clerk. The town name was changed from Tar Creek to Cardin in 1920. There were 2,640 residents in 1920, many of them mineworkers.

This was part of the Tri-State district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas, and northeast Oklahoma, which produced more than 43% of the lead and zinc in the United States in the early 20th century.

===Buyout and shutdown===
The town, along with Picher, and Hockerville, Oklahoma, is located within the Tar Creek Superfund site. This was designated in 1983 under laws intended to allocate federal funding to clean up former mining sites of extensive pollution.

These towns are part of a $60 million federal buyout because of lead pollution, as well as the risk of buildings caving in due to decades of underground mining. Cardin, Oklahoma, officially closed its last business, the post office, on February 28, 2009. In April 2009, federal officials stated that only seven residences were occupied in Cardin and that the town&#x27;s water service would soon be shut off. Cardin was the first city within the Superfund area to be completely closed down. In November 2010, the last family in Cardin received its final buyout payment from the federally funded Lead-Impacted Communities Relocation Assistance Trust. They departed, reducing the town&#x27;s population to zero.

Similarly, Picher was officially unincorporated in 2013, after reductions in population due to buyouts and to damage from the 2008 tornado. The state and EPA estimate that years more of investment and treatment will be required to reduce contamination to acceptable levels, and restore some of the habitat and landscape.

<doc id="130488" wikidata="Q2005257" url="?curid=130488" title="Commerce, Oklahoma">
<text>Commerce is a city in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 2,473 at the 2010 census, down 6.5 percent from the figure of 2,645 in 2000, and lower than the 2,555 residents it had in 1920.

==History==

What became Commerce was land that was part of the Quapaw Indian Agency, allocated in the late 1830s. The Quapaw were removed to the area in the 1830s by the federal government after residing for hundreds of years on the west side of the Mississippi River in what later entered the union as the state of Arkansas.

Immigrants arrived and formed a mining camp named Hattonville after Amos Hatton. In 1906, Hatton developed the Emma Gordon zinc and lead mine, whose resources had attracted workers. Starting in 1908, the Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri Inter-Urban Railway built a line between Miami and Commerce to serve the mining industry. In a series of steps the line was later acquired by the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway. In 1913, the residents called the local post office North Miami, though by June 1914 the post office took the present-day city&#x27;s name that came from the Commerce Mining and Royalty Company, which had bought the mining camp.

In 1914, the mining company platted the town; a mayor–council government formed two years later. By the 1920 census, Commerce had a population of 2,555. The town&#x27;s population has remained roughly the same size ever since.

Commerce was on Route 66 when that highway was commissioned in 1926, and was the first town on the route through Oklahoma after crossing the Kansas border westbound.

Commerce was the site of two notable events in the mid-1930s. In April 1934, Bonnie and Clyde and their associate Henry Methvin killed Commerce Constable William C. Campbell and kidnapped police chief Percy Boyd. By May, Bonnie and Clyde would both be dead.
In 1935, in an event that would later become notable in retrospect, Mickey Mantle&#x27;s father would move his family to Commerce, to work as a miner. Mantle would later be nicknamed &quot;The Commerce Comet.&quot;

Most mines closed by 1960, due to a declining market and the realization of extensive environmental damage to ground, water and air. Residents have turned to occupations such as farming and ranching,

==Geography==
Commerce is located at (36.933529, -94.871371), five miles () north of Miami on U.S. Route 69, which was once part of historic U.S. Route 66. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Fairland is a town in southern Ottawa County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,057 at the 2010 U. S. Census, an increase from the figure of 1,025 recorded in 2000. The town is in the historic Cherokee Nation.

==History==
Fairland was laid out along the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway (Frisco) tracks that were laid from Missouri to Vinita in 1871. The town originally covered 225 acres and consisted of a few businesses and residences that had moved there from the Prairie Springs area.

By the time Oklahoma became a state, Fairland was an active farming community. In 1912, the Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway, later the Kansas, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway (KO&amp;G), constructed a track through Fairland that crossed the earlier Frisco line.

Agriculture remained the mainstay of the local economy until the end of World War II. In 1945, B. F. Goodrich opened a tire manufacturing plant near Miami that became the major contributor to Fairland&#x27;s economy. The town organized a volunteer fire department and built a sewer system about 1950. The Fairland School district absorbed several smaller districts. However, KO&amp;G abandoned and removed its tracks about the same time.
The Goodrich plant closed permanently in February 1985. The loss to Fairland&#x27;s economy was offset by the opening of several communities on the shore of Grand Lake O&#x27; the Cherokees.

<text>Miami ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Ottawa County, Oklahoma, United States, founded in 1891. Lead and zinc mining were established by 1918, causing the area&#x27;s economy to boom.

This area was part of Indian Territory. Miami is the capital of the federally recognized Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, after which it is named; the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma, the Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma, the Peoria Tribe of Indians, and the Shawnee Tribe. As of the 2020 census, the population was 12,969.

==History==
The city was founded in an unusual way, compared to other towns established in Indian Territory. Per the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot; &quot;... it was settled in a business-like way by men of vision who looked into the future and saw possibilities. It didn&#x27;t just grow. It was carefully planned.&quot;

W. C. Lykins petitioned the U.S. Congress to pass legislation on March 3, 1891, to establish the town. He met with Thomas F. Richardville, chief of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, who agreed to meet in turn with the U.S. Indian Commission and the Ottawa Tribe.

That meeting resulted in Congress authorizing the secretary of the United States Department of the Interior to approve the townsite purchase from the Ottawa. Lykins, Richardville and Manford Pooler, chief of the Ottawa, are identified in historical accounts as &quot;fathers of Miami.&quot; Lykins&#x27; company, the Miami Town Company, bought of land from the Ottawa for ten dollars an acre. On June 25–26, 1891 they held an auction of lots. In 1895, Miami incorporated and had more than 800 residents.

The discovery of rich deposits of lead and zinc under Quapaw land a few miles north caused Miami to boom. In 1907, at the time of statehood, its population was 1,893. As mining increased and more mills were built, the population more than tripled to 6,802 by 1920.

Miami was on the route of the Jefferson Highway established in 1915, with that international road running more than from Winnipeg, Manitoba in Canada across the border and to New Orleans, Louisiana. US Route 66 in Oklahoma also passed through Miami. An historic section of the Route 66 roadbed is marked in Miami.

It is the capital of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, after which it is named; the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma, Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma, Peoria Tribe of Indians, and Shawnee Tribe.

==Geography==

=== Flooding ===
Miami is located on the Neosho River, and was severely affected by the Great Flood of 1951. The town has flooded more than two dozen times since the 1990s, most recently during the 2019 Arkansas River floods. Town residents and neighboring Native American groups have objected to maintaining high water levels on the river at Pensacola Dam and its popular vacation area, Grand Lake, on the grounds that when water backs up downstream, it can increase Miami&#x27;s flooding problems.

==Demographics==

Miami and Ottawa County, together with nearby Delaware County, Oklahoma to the south, attract numerous tourists to the state. These counties combined make up the third-largest tourism destination in the state, following only the Oklahoma City and Tulsa metropolitan areas.


Miami is home to the historic Coleman Theatre, located at 103 N. Main St. On April 18, 1929, the 1,600-seat Coleman Theatre enjoyed a grand opening as a luxurious movie theater of the time. Designed by the Boller Bros., and built by George L. Coleman Sr. at a cost of $600,000, the Louis XV interior includes gold leaf trim, silk damask panels, stained glass panels, marble accents, a carved mahogany staircase, Wurlitzer pipe organ, decorative plaster moldings, and bronze railings. While there have been many changes to seeing movies in grand theaters, the building has been preserved and also serves as a venue for live performances. In 1959 a local non-profit community group established the Miami Little Theatre. The community theater group presents five large-scale productions on the Coleman stage every year. In 1983, the Coleman Theatre was placed on the National Register of Historical Places for Ottawa County.

<doc id="130494" wikidata="Q3448427" url="?curid=130494" title="Peoria, Oklahoma">
<text>Peoria is a town in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, United States. It was named for the Peoria people, a tribe of Native Americans who were removed to Indian Territory from east of the Mississippi River during the 19th century. The territory had been occupied by the Quapaw people, who sold some of their land to the Peoria. The population was 131 at the 2010 U. S. Census, down from 141 at the 2000 census. The long decline of mining meant that jobs moved elsewhere.

==History==
The area of northeastern Oklahoma around Peoria has long been associated with mineral extraction. The Native Americans had operated a chert quarry here well before the area was visited by Europeans. This was part of the territory of the Quapaw people, and later the Peoria and related remnant tribes.

Peoria began developing in 1891 as a mining camp for the Tri-State District, made up of parts of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas, and northeast Indian Territory, now Oklahoma. A post office was opened in 1891 and named to honor the Peoria tribe. These lead and zinc mines were most productive between 1891 and 1896. In 1897, ore production began moving farther north in Ottawa County. In 1894 William Holmes conducted the first professional archaeological study in the future state at this site. Peoria incorporated in 1898.

Peoria&#x27;s population declined as mining moved out of the area. A few mines continued small-scale production until the mid 1940s. The post office closed in 1941. The Peoria school district consolidated with that of Quapaw in 1970.

==Geography==
The town is about 14.8 driving miles east-northeast of Miami, Oklahoma in the far northeastern corner of the state. It is 3.1 driving miles west of the Missouri border and 7.6 driving miles south of the Kansas border.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

<doc id="130495" wikidata="Q58024" url="?curid=130495" title="EBay">
<text>eBay Inc. ( , often stylized as ebay or Ebay) is an American multinational e-commerce company based in San Jose, California, that allows users to buy or view items via retail sales through online marketplaces and websites in 190 markets worldwide. Sales occur either via online auctions or &quot;buy it now&quot; instant sales, and the company charges commissions to sellers upon sales. eBay was founded by Pierre Omidyar in September 1995. It has 132 million yearly active buyers worldwide and handled $73 billion in transactions in 2023, 48% of which were in the United States. In 2023, the company had a take rate (revenue as a percentage of volume) of 13.81%.

eBay can be used by individuals, companies and governments to purchase and sell almost any legal, non-controversial item. eBay&#x27;s auctions use a Vickrey auction (sealed-bid) proxy bid system. Buyers and sellers may rate and review each other after each transaction, resulting in a reputation system. The eBay service is accessible via websites and mobile apps. Software developers can create applications that integrate with eBay through the eBay API. Merchants can also earn commissions from affiliate marketing programs by eBay.

==History==
===1990s===
eBay was founded as AuctionWeb in California on September 3, 1995, by French-born Iranian-American computer programmer Pierre Omidyar as a hobby to make some extra money. One of the first items sold on AuctionWeb was a broken laser pointer for $14.83. Astonished, Omidyar contacted the winning bidder to ask if he understood that the laser pointer was broken; the buyer explained: &quot;I&#x27;m a collector of broken laser pointers.&quot;

In February 1996, Omidyar&#x27;s internet service provider informed him that he would need to upgrade to a business account due to the high web traffic of his website. The monthly price increase from $30 to $250 prompted Omidyar to start charging eBay users. The website made $1,000 in its first month, which was more than it cost to run, and $2,500 in its second month. Chris Agarpao was eBay&#x27;s first employee; he processed mailed check payments.

Jeffrey Skoll was hired as the first president of the company in early 1996. In November 1996, the company launched online auctions for airline seats, hotel rooms, cruise berths and other travel-related products in partnership with Electronic Travel Auctions. By that time, the company had hosted more than 200,000 auctions since its founding 14 months earlier.

The company changed the name of its service from AuctionWeb to eBay in September 1997, after Echo Bay Technology Group, Omidyar&#x27;s consulting firm. The echobay.com domain name was already registered by Echo Bay Mines, a gold mining company, so Omidyar shortened it to eBay.com. In 1997, the company received $6.7 million in venture capital funding from Benchmark.

The frequently repeated story that eBay was founded to help Omidyar&#x27;s fiancée trade Pez candy dispensers was fabricated in 1997 by public relations manager Mary Lou Song to give the media a human-interest story and to generate publicity with toy collectors. The most purchased and sold items on the website were Beanie Babies, the most difficult toys to find in retail stores, accounting for 10% of all listings in 1997. Ty, the manufacturer, had set up a website whereby people could trade used Beanie Babies. However, it was overwhelmed with unsortable listings. With a user-friendly interface, eBay became popular with collectors.

Meg Whitman was appointed president and CEO in March 1998. At the time, the company had 30 employees, 500,000 users, and revenues of $4.7 million in the United States. In July 1998, eBay acquired Jump, the developer and operator of Up4Sale, an advertising-supported auction website which at the time had 27,000 separate auctions and 50,000 registered members.
In September 1998, during the dot-com bubble, eBay became a public company via an initial public offering led by CFO Gary F. Bengier. Upon the initial public offering, which was priced at $18 per share and closed for trading on its first day at $53 per share, both Omidyar and Skoll became billionaires. In the risk factors section of the annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 1998, Omidyar noted eBay&#x27;s dependence on the continued strength of the Beanie Babies market.

===2000s===
In June 2000, eBay acquired Half.com for $312 million in stock. In 2000, eBay partnered with Escrow.com to handle escrow for purchases and sales of motor vehicles, later expanded to other transaction types. By year-end, it had 22.5 million registered users and 79.4 million auctions per quarter.

In January 2001, eBay acquired a majority stake in Internet Auction Co. Ltd, operator of the largest internet auction website in South Korea.

On May 28, 2003, in the case of &quot;eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.&quot;, which had implications for the treatment of business method patents, a United States district court jury found eBay guilty of willful patent infringement and ordered the company to pay $35 million in damages after MercExchange accused eBay of infringing on three patents, one of which is used in eBay&#x27;s &quot;Buy It Now&quot; feature. The decision was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC). The CAFC affirmed the judgment of willful infringement, and reversed the lower court and granted a permanent injunction. eBay appealed the permanent injunction to the Supreme Court of the United States, which on May 15, 2006 found an injunction is not required nor automatic in this or any patent case where guilt has been established. The case was sent back to the Virginia district court for consideration of the injunction and a trial on another MercExchange patent.

In April 2008, eBay sued Craigslist, claiming that in January 2008, Craigslist took actions that &quot;unfairly diluted eBay&#x27;s economic interest by more than 10%&quot;, making eBay lose its seat on the board of directors of Craigslist. Craigslist countersued in May 2008 alleging that eBay used its board seat to gain insider information about Craigslist that was used to compete against the company. In September 2010, Delaware Judge William B. Chandler III ruled that the actions of Craigslist were unlawful and that the actions were taken by Craigslist founders Jim Buckmaster and Craig Newmark had &quot;breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty&quot;, and restored eBay&#x27;s stake in the company to 28.4% from a diluted level of 24.85%. However, the judge dismissed eBay&#x27;s objection to a staggered board provision, citing that Craigslist has the right to protect its own trade secrets.

In May 2008, eBay announced the opening of a building on the company&#x27;s North Campus in San Jose, California, the first ground-up structure in the city to be built to LEED Gold standards.

===Financial history===
==Philanthropy and charity auctions==
Using MissionFish as an arbiter, eBay allows sellers to donate a portion of their auction proceeds to a charity of the seller&#x27;s choice and charges discounted fees for charity auctions.

High-profile charity auctions facilitated via eBay include the &quot;Power Lunch&quot; with investor Warren Buffett for 8 people at the Smith &amp; Wollensky restaurant in New York City, with all of the proceeds going to the Glide Foundation. Auctions were held annually in 21 years between 2000 and 2022, with no auctions in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, auctions on eBay for lunch with Buffett raised $53.2 million for the Glide Foundation, with winning bids ranging from $2 million to as high as $19 million for the final auction in 2022. In May 2024, a charity auction for lunch with Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, raised $200,000 plus an additional donation of $1.5 million for the Glide Foundation.

Also benefitting charity, a letter sent to Mark P. Mays, CEO of Clear Channel Communications by Senator Harry Reid and forty other Democratic senators, complaining about comments made by conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh, sold for $2,100,100, with all of the proceeds going to the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation, benefiting the education of children of men and women who have died serving in the armed forces. The winning bid was matched by Limbaugh.

In 2022, more than $163 million was raised for charities via the platform.

==Stalking scandal==

In June 2020, five employees were terminated and were subject to charges of cyberstalking after they were accused of targeting Ina and David Steiner, the editors and publishers of EcommerceBytes, a newsletter that eBay executives viewed as critical of the company. In addition to sending harassing messages and doxing, the defendants &quot;ordered anonymous and disturbing deliveries to the victims’ home, including a preserved fetal pig, a bloody pig Halloween mask, a funeral wreath, a book on surviving the loss of a spouse, and pornography&quot;. The defendants also vandalized the couple&#x27;s home in Natick, Massachusetts. The conspirators pleaded guilty and most were sentenced to prison terms. Wenig, the company&#x27;s CEO at the time of the harassment campaign, who was frequently targeted by the newsletter, was found by investigators to not have any knowledge about the harassment activities and was not charged. He left the company in September 2019 with a $57 million severance package. Steve Wymer, chief communication officer, who had ties with local politicians, was fired &quot;for cause&quot; for alleged involvement but was not charged and was hired by the local chapter of the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America.

==Criticisms and controversies==
===Fraud===
Fraud committed by sellers includes selling counterfeit merchandise / bootleg recordings, shill bidding (undisclosed vendor bidding that is used to artificially inflate the price of a certain item by either the seller under an alternate account or another person in collusion with the seller), receiving payment and not shipping merchandise, shipping items other than those described, giving a deliberately misleading description or photo, knowingly and deliberately shipping faulty merchandise, denying warranty exchange after pre-agreeing to return merchandise authorization of merchandise, knowingly fencing (selling stolen goods), misrepresenting the cost of shipping, using bulk shipping prices to knowingly mask much higher costing, individual return shipping, and using pseudo-accounts to make high nonpaying bids on similar items that competitors are selling. eBay has been criticized for not doing enough to combat shill bidding. There are techniques such as auction sniping, which let buyers avoid shill bidders.

Fraud committed by buyers includes filing a false shipping damage claim with the shipping company, friendly fraud (receiving merchandise and claiming otherwise), returning items other than received, removing parts from an item and returning it for a refund, sending a forged payment-service e-mail that states that he or she has made a payment to the seller&#x27;s account as proof of payment, making a low bid then using pseudo-accounts to make high nonpaying bids in an attempt at gaining a low second chance offer price, damaging a non-refundable item to get a refund by claiming that the seller sent the item already damaged (in cases of buyer&#x27;s remorse), and a package redirection scam, in which the return package is filled with garbage and sent to the wrong address.

In 2004, Tiffany &amp; Co. filed a lawsuit against eBay claiming that over 70% of the Tiffany silver jewelry offered for sale on eBay was fake and that eBay profited from the sales of counterfeit Tiffany items that infringed on its trademark. On July 14, 2008, a Federal District Court judge ruled that eBay does not have a legal responsibility to monitor users selling counterfeit items. In 2010, the Second Circuit affirmed this decision in &quot;Tiffany (NJ) Inc. v. eBay Inc.&quot;

In June 2008, a court in Paris awarded damages of €40 million to LVMH over eBay auctions of counterfeit bags, perfumes, and other items sold by non-authorized retailers and entered a permanent injunction against eBay auctions of LVMH perfumes, whether counterfeit or not. eBay banned such items from its site. Also that month, a court in Troyes, France awarded eBay to pay luxury goods maker Hermès €20,000 due to the sale of two counterfeit bags on eBay in 2006. The court also ordered eBay to post the ruling on the home page of eBay&#x27;s French website for three months.

====Items stolen from the British Museum====
Items stolen from the British Museum in 2013 were auctioned on eBay in 2016. The museum reported that several items of jewelry made of gold, semi-precious stones, and glass, dating from between 1,500 BC and the 19th centuryAD, were among those missing. One piece of ancient Roman jewelry made from onyx – valued between £25,000 and £50,000, or US$32,000 and US$63,000 – was listed on eBay with a minimum price of £40 (US$50) in 2016. There were no bids made for the treasure. The police are investigating this case. The company said that it is supports local police in investigations and removes listings containing stolen property.

====Dr. Seuss books====
In 2021, the estate of Dr. Seuss requested from eBay, and the company complied, to ban the sale of six Dr. Seuss books due to concerns that some images contained therein were racially insensitive. This led to backlash from followers of right-wing politics and ignited a surge of interest in the discontinued books.

===Sale of illegal items===
In September 2023, the United States Department of Justice sued eBay, accusing it of violating the Clean Air Act and other environmental laws by allowing the sale of several illegal products, including devices that defeat automobile pollution controls, restricted-use pesticides, and paint and coating removal products containing methylene chloride.

<doc id="130496" wikidata="Q2844779" url="?curid=130496" title="Picher, Oklahoma">
<text>Picher is a ghost town and former city in Ottawa County, northeastern Oklahoma, United States. It was a major national center of lead and zinc mining for more than 100 years in the heart of the Tri-State Mining District.

Decades of unrestricted subsurface excavation dangerously undermined most of Picher&#x27;s town buildings and left giant piles of toxic metal-contaminated mine tailings (known as chat) heaped throughout the area. The discovery of cave-in risks, groundwater contamination and health effects associated with the chat piles and subsurface shafts resulted in the site being included in 1983 in the Tar Creek Superfund site by the US Environmental Protection Agency.

The state collaborated on mitigation and remediation measures, but a 1994 study found that 34% of the children in Picher suffered from lead poisoning due to these environmental effects, which could result in lifelong neurological problems. Eventually, the EPA and the state of Oklahoma agreed to a mandatory evacuation and buyout of the entire township.

A 2006 Army Corps of Engineers study showed 86% of Picher&#x27;s buildings (including the town school) were badly undermined and subject to collapse at any time. The destruction in May 2008 of 150 homes by an EF4 tornado accelerated the exodus of the remaining population.

On September 1, 2009, the state of Oklahoma officially dis-incorporated the city of Picher, which ceased official operations on that day. The population plummeted from 1,640 at the 2000 census to 20 at the 2010 census. The federal government proceeded to conduct buyouts of remaining properties. As of January 2011, six homes and one business remained, their owners having refused to leave at any price. Except for some historic structures, the rest of the town&#x27;s buildings were scheduled to be demolished by the end of the year. One of the last vacant buildings, which had housed the former Picher mining museum, was destroyed by arson in April 2015. Its historical archives and artifacts had already been shipped to the Dobson Museum in Miami, Oklahoma by that point.

Picher is among a small number of locations in the world (such as Gilman, Colorado; Centralia, Pennsylvania; and Wittenoom, Western Australia) to be evacuated and declared uninhabitable due to environmental and health damage caused by mining.

The closest towns to Picher, other than nearby fellow ghost towns Cardin, Treece and Douthat, are Commerce, Quapaw (the headquarters of the federally recognized Native American nation by that name), and Miami, Oklahoma.

==History==

=== Mining origins ===
In 1913, as the Tri-State district expanded, lead and zinc were discovered on Harry Crawfish&#x27;s claim, and mining began. A townsite developed overnight around the new workings and was named Picher in honor of O. S. Picher, owner of Picher Lead Company. The city was incorporated in 1918, and by 1920, Picher had a population of 9,726. Peak population occurred in 1926 with 14,252 residents.

The Picher area became the most productive lead-zinc mining field in the Tri-State district, producing over $20 billion worth of ore between 1917 and 1947. More than fifty percent of the lead and zinc used during World War I was extracted from the Picher district. At its peak more than 14,000 miners worked the mines and another 4,000 worked in mining services. Many workers commuted by an extensive interurban trolley system from as far away as Joplin and Carthage, Missouri.

=== Decline and pollution problems ===
The population entered a steady decline after the peak in 1926 due to the decrease in mining activity, leaving Picher with only 2,553 by 1960. Mining ceased in 1967 and water pumping from the mines ceased. The contaminated water from 14,000 abandoned mine shafts, 70 million tons of mine tailings, and 36 million tons of mill sand and sludge remained as a huge environmental cleanup problem. As a result of national legislation to identify and remediate such environmentally hazardous sites, in 1983 the area was designated as part of the Tar Creek Superfund site, along with the similarly contaminated satellite towns of Treece, Kansas, and Cardin, Oklahoma.

In 1994, Indian Health Service test results concerning the blood lead levels of Indian children living on the Site indicated that approximately 35 percent of the children tested had concentrations of lead in their blood exceeding 10 micrograms per deciliter, the level of lead in the blood the Centers for Disease Control considers to be a health concern. In August 1994, to address the threat of lead exposure to children, EPA began sampling soils at high-access areas, such as day cares, schoolyards, and other areas where children congregate. The sampling detected significant concentrations of lead, cadmium, and other heavy metals in surface soils. Eventually, the EPA and the state of Oklahoma agreed to a mandatory evacuation and buyout of the entire township.

While some remediation took place in the following quarter century, contamination and other environmental hazards were found to be so severe that the government decided to close Picher and relocate its residents, as reported on April 24, 2006, by Reuters. Due in large part to the removal of large amounts of subsurface material during mining operations, many of the city&#x27;s structures have been deemed in imminent danger of caving in.

===Tornado===

On May 10, 2008, Picher was struck by an EF4 tornado. There were six confirmed deaths, possibly including one child, and many other people injured. The tornado first touched down near the Kansas–Oklahoma border in Oklahoma southwest of Chetopa, Kansas, and tracked eastward. It struck Picher, causing extensive damage to 20 blocks of the city, with houses and businesses destroyed or flattened. At least 150 people were injured in Picher alone. The tornado continued eastward, passing just north of Quapaw and Peoria before crossing Interstate 44 into Missouri. Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry sent National Guard troops as well as emergency personnel to assist the hardest hit area in Picher. Loss of power from the tornado forced the city to go on a boiled water notice. Staff from the Oklahoma Rural Water Association arrived to assist, since the utility&#x27;s testing equipment was destroyed by the storm. With an emergency generator to supply power, rural water staff had the system running normally only two days after the tornado struck.

Given the existing plan to vacate the city, the federal government decided against aid to rebuild homes, and the buyouts continued as previously scheduled, with people being assisted in relocation.

=== Closure ===
The city&#x27;s post office was scheduled to close in July 2009, and the city ceased operations as a municipality on September 1, 2009. By June 29, 2009, all of the residents had been given federal checks to enable them to relocate from Picher permanently. The city is considered to be too toxic to be habitable. On the last day, all the final residents met at the school auditorium to say goodbye. As of November 2010, it was reported that Picher still had &quot;one business and six occupied houses.&quot;

Starting in January 2011, almost all remaining commercial structures were scheduled to be demolished. Gary Linderman, owner of the Ole Miners Pharmacy, said he would stay until the last resident left.

The municipality of Picher was officially dissolved on November 26, 2013. By March 2014, standing abandoned buildings included the Picher-Cardin High School building, a Christian church, the mining museum, and a handful of mercantile buildings, as well as numerous abandoned houses.

The Picher Mining Field Museum, which had been housed in the former Tri-State Zinc and Lead Ore Producers Association building, was destroyed by arson in April 2015. The museum archives had previously been sent to Pittsburg State University, and other artifacts had been sent to the Baxter Springs, Kansas Heritage Center and Museum. In March 2017 the often-photographed Christian church, which was originally a one-room schoolhouse, was also destroyed by fire.

Gary Linderman, owner of the Ole Miners Pharmacy, was featured in the May 28, 2007, issue of &quot;People&quot; magazine in the &quot;Heroes Among Us&quot; article: &quot;Prescription for Kindness&quot;. He vowed to stay as long as there was anyone left who needed him and to be the last one out of the city. He died on June 9, 2015, at the age of 60 from a sudden illness.

Meanwhile, the cleanup continues. On September 17, 2019, the EPA, in cooperation with the state of Oklahoma and the Quapaw Nation, released the Final Tar Creek Strategic Plan to advance the cleanup of the Tar Creek Superfund site. The EPA indicated while great progress had been made, much work was yet to be done, and the Plan was a commitment to accelerate the cleanup.

Since 2015, former residents have held Christmas parades in Picher.

=== 1984 Oklahoma Class A champions ===
In 1984, the local High school football team, the Gorillas, won the Oklahoma Class A Championship. A statue of a Gorilla was dedicated as the Picher-Cardin Memorial, Home of the Gorillas.

==Representation in media==
Picher was featured in the PBS Independent Lens film &quot;The Creek Runs Red,&quot; which discussed the connection of the people and their desire to leave or stay in the city. Picher was also featured in the Jump the Fence Productions film titled &quot;Tar Creek&quot; (2009). The film was written, directed, and narrated by Matt Myers.

Picher was featured in an episode of &quot;Life After People: The Series&quot; on the History Channel. The aforementioned tornado was also featured on an episode of the Weather Channel&#x27;s &quot;Storm Stories&quot;.

Picher was also featured in the premiere episode of &quot;Forgotten Planet: Abandoned America&quot; on the Discovery Channel (along with Pripyat, Ukraine) in a story of two cities abandoned due to industrial disasters.

In April 2015, Picher was featured in a segment on the National Geographic Channel called &quot;The Watch&quot;, in which one of a handful of holdouts still resides and watches over what is left of the town.

Police investigating the Welch, Oklahoma murders of Danny and Kathy Freemen and the murders of Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman filed charges containing statements from numerous witnesses and alleged accomplices who stated they had heard rumors that Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman were in a pit or mineshaft in Picher, or had been threatened by Warren Philip Welch, lead suspect in the crimes, who told them they would &quot;end up in a pit in Picher like those two girls.&quot; Their bodies have never been found, though suspected accomplice Ronnie Dean Busick was arrested in April 2018 for his involvement in the crimes. Busick pleaded guilty July 15, 2020 to being an accessory to first-degree murder in the deaths of Danny and Kathy Freeman, the torching of their home near Welch, Oklahoma, and the abduction and presumed slayings of the two girls. He admitted having withheld information about the involvement of Warren &quot;Phil&quot; Welch and David Pennington, both of whom have since died without ever having been charged. He was sentenced to 15 years for the crime, with 10 of the years to be spent in lockup.

The Oklahoma City sludge metal band, Chat Pile, takes their name from the chat piles in the city.

There is a musical in the process of being created based on the real story of the town. Titled &quot;The Picher Project&quot;, the story combines real life people, such as Tar Creek waterkeeper Rebecca Jim and Picher-native, and previous Mayor, Orvile &quot;Hoppy&quot; Ray as well as fictional characters based on actual people in order to properly tell the story of the town and the people who lived there, as well as the Quapaw nation. The show was conceptualized and is being created by Quentin Madia, Lauren Pelaia, and Alex Knezevic, with Knezevic eventually leaving the production on good terms to pursue independent ventures. Prior to the formal creation and writing of the script and music, the production team visited the town of Picher and were toured around by Rebecca Jim. They also interviewed several former citizens of the town, such as Orville Ray&#x27;s son. The musical has had workshop performances at Dixon Place, BarnArts, and 54 Below, as well as a virtual performance of a of couple songs using the non-profit theatre company &quot;The Dare Tactic&quot; to promote the songs and gain feedback on the show. On April 30, 2023, Media and Pelaia directed a workshop of the show at The College of New Jersey with members of the college&#x27;s musical theatre organization performing the most recent version of the script for an invite-only audience. Beginning on September 28th, 2023, and ending the following month on October 21st the production saw it&#x27;s first full residency, returning to Dixon Place. &quot;The Picher Project&quot; has been featured in multiple news articles, including two from The Joplin Globe, KOAM-TV, &quot;Four States News&quot;, &quot;E &amp; E News&quot;, and BroadwayWorld.

<text>Quapaw, officially the Town of Quapaw, is a town in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, United States, which serves as the capital of the Quapaw Nation. Located about northeast of Miami, it is part of the Joplin, Missouri metropolitan area. Incorporated in 1917, Quapaw&#x27;s population was 811 in 2020.

==History==
In 1891, Kansas farmer Isaac Bingham moved his family south into Ottawa County, then part of land assigned to the Quapaw Nation. It became part of the state of Oklahoma in 1907 after admission. The family founded a community and opened several businesses. Quapaw Chief John Quapaw donated land for a community school. The Kansas City, Fort Scott and Memphis Railroad established a railroad stop and siding at this site. This established access to markets for hay and agricultural products of the area, attracting more settlers. A post office was opened in the community grocery store in 1897.

The community leaders platted &quot;New Town Quapaw&quot; on land to the east that was purchased from Harry Whitebird (Quapaw). This &quot;new&quot; town was incorporated in 1917 as Quapaw. Discovery of lead and zinc ores in the area resulted in this area being developed as part of the Tri-State mining district. As thousands of miners moved into the larger area, a population boom occurred.
The county had a significant population from several federally recognized tribes, such as the Quapaw. The population and economic boom stimulated development of new businesses. The 1920 census for the town listed 1,394 residents. In the 1920s, U. S. Route 66 was developed through Quapaw and was paved through Ottawa County by 1933. This event was celebrated with Quapaw Chief Victor Griffin laying a zinc tablet in the center of Main Street.

As the local mining operations began to decline before World War II, jobs left the region and the population declined to 1,054 by 1940, and to 850 by 1960. The region was left with widespread mine tailings, known as chat, and extensive environmental toxic hazards.

==Geography==

==In popular culture==
Quapaw is mentioned in the film &quot;Oklahoma&quot; as one of the towns in which the character Jud had worked at some point in the past. Jud recounted a fictional case of deadly arson that occurred five years prior to the film&#x27;s setting.

Quapaw was mentioned in a 1976 episode of the television show &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, a U.S. situation comedy. In the episode &quot;The Colonel&#x27;s Horse&quot;, when Colonel Potter goes to Tokyo on R&amp;R, his horse develops colic. Mike Farrell&#x27;s character B.J. said his wife Peg (played by Catherine Bergstrom) was from Quapaw and that his father-in-law knew all about horses; they called him for advice. Coincidentally, fellow &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; cast member Judy Farrell, Mike Farrell&#x27;s real-life wife at the time, was born in Quapaw.

<doc id="130498" wikidata="Q947631" url="?curid=130498" title="Wyandotte, Oklahoma">
<text>Wyandotte is a town in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 333 at the 2010 census, a decline of 8.26 percent from the figure of 363 recorded in 2000. The town is the tribal headquarters of the Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma, for which the town was named.

==History==

The Wyandotte tribe was removed to this area in 1867. The Society of Friends (Quakers) established a mission here in 1869, and the Wyandotte Tribal Council donated land for the Quakers to establish a boarding school for Seneca, Shawnee and Wyandotte children. Construction of the school began in 1871 and classes began in 1872. Originally named Prairie City, the post office was renamed to the city&#x27;s current name in 1894.

In the mid 1920s, Wyandotte was nationally known for having an all-female city government due to changes in the electorate of the town after the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. The mayor of the town during this period, Mamie Foster, served for over five years as Oklahoma&#x27;s first female mayor.

In the late 1930s, the Federal Government built Pensacola Dam, which created Grand Lake o&#x27; the Cherokees. Although the lake took away part of Wyandotte&#x27;s land, it added business in the form of residential development and tourist industry. This caused a resumption of population growth.

In 1966, town officials discovered that Wyandotte had never filed incorporation papers. They petitioned the Ottawa County Board of Commissioners for an election, which was approved. A majority voted for incorporation, which became effective in April 1966.

==History==
After the Cherokee Outlet opening, a homesteader by the name of Willis H. Herbert established a town named Herbert by opening a post office on the current townsite of Cleveland on October 28, 1893. The Post Office department subsequently withdrew the approval of the Herbert post office. The post office was then moved 100 feet, and reestablished under the name Cleveland, named in honor of then President Grover Cleveland on April 19, 1894. By 1900, the town&#x27;s population was 211. Before the discovery of oil in the area, the town served as a trade center between the local farmers and the Osage Tribe who lived on the reservation on the other side of the Arkansas river.

In 1904, a railroad line owned by the Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad (later known as Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway or Katy) from Oklahoma City reached Cleveland and crossed the Arkansas River into Osage County. On May 27, 1904, the first oil well was spudded near the community, and it caused an influx of oil workers and other people. At the time of statehood in 1907, Cleveland had 1,441 residents.

<text>Pawnee (Pawnee: Paári, ) is a city and county seat of Pawnee County, Oklahoma, United States. The town is northeast of Stillwater at the junction of U.S. Route 64 and State Highway 18.

It was named for the Pawnee tribe, which was relocated to this area between 1873 and 1875. The population was 1,936 as of the 2020 Census. 
==History==
The Pawnee Agency and Pawnee Boarding School were established after the Pawnee tribe came to this area in 1875. The Pawnee Agency was designated as a post office on May 4, 1876. The area was opened to non-Indian settlers on September 16, 1893, during the Cherokee Outlet Opening. Townsite Number Thirteen (later Pawnee) had been designated as the temporary county seat. The post office was redesignated from Pawnee Agency to Pawnee on October 26, 1893. The town incorporated on April 16, 1894. On September 9, 1895, the townspeople dedicated a stone county courthouse.

The Eastern Oklahoma Railway, which later became part of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, built a line through Pawnee between 1900 and 1902. In 1902, the Arkansas Valley and Western Railway (later the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway) also built a line through the city. The railroads enabled Pawnee to develop as an agricultural trade center. The population was 1,943 at statehood in 1907. Since statehood, Pawnee has seen a overall decline in population with the 2020 Census reporting a population of 1,936.

Pawnee continued to develop during the Great Depression, largely because of Federal works projects. A hospital to care for the Ponca, Pawnee, Kaw, Otoe, and Tonkawa people opened January 15, 1931. A new school building at the Osage Agency opened in 1932. A new county courthouse was also built in 1932. Finally, the federal government built a reservoir named Pawnee Lake two miles north of town in 1932; the lake has 5.4 miles of shoreline, a surface area of 310 acres, and a maximum depth of 24.3 feet.

<text>Terlton is a town in Pawnee County, Oklahoma, United States. It is located one-half mile south of US 412/US 64 on Terlton Road and County Road E0570. The population was 77 at the time of the 2020 Census.

==History==
The community started forming not long after the Cherokee Outlet opening on September 16, 1893. A post office was established November 30, 1894, and town was named Terlton for a member of the first territorial legislature, Ira N. Terrell. The Arkansas Valley and Western Railway (later the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway) built through town in the 1902-1903 timeframe, and Terlton developed into a trade center for the local agricultural industry. Oil was discovered in the vicinity about 1914, and oil-related industries like pipelines, tank farms and refining supported the town into the 1930s. In more recent years, Terlton has become a commuter town whose residents work in other locations and commute back to Terlton to live.

On Thursday April 26, 1984, a large nighttime F4 tornado struck the small town, killing three people and injuring over 30. This happened the same night as a tornado killed eight and injured nearly 100 in Morris, Oklahoma in Okmulgee County, to the southeast.

In 1985 an explosion at the Aerlex Corp. fireworks plant in town killed 21 people, about one-quarter of the community at that time. A short-film documentary, “Terlton,” debuted in 2019, documenting how the town has dealt with the tragedy.

Terlton was one of the filming sites for principal photography on Season One of the FX comedy series &quot;Reservation Dogs&quot; from filmmaker Sterlin Harjo, which concerns four Native American teens in rural Oklahoma.

<text>Cushing (, , &quot;meaning: &quot;Soft-seat town&quot;&quot;) is a city in Payne County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 7,826 at the time of the 2010 census, a decline of 6.5% since 8,371 in 2000. Cushing was established after the Land Run of 1891 by William &quot;Billy Rae&quot; Little. It was named for Marshall Cushing, private secretary to U.S. Postmaster General John Wanamaker.

A 1912 oil boom led to the city&#x27;s development as a refining center, with over 50 refineries operating in Cushing over its history. Today, Cushing is a major trading hub for crude oil and a price settlement point for West Texas Intermediate on the New York Mercantile Exchange and is known as the &quot;Pipeline Crossroads of the World.&quot;

==History==
The area that became Cushing was part of the Sac and Fox Reservation. With the Land Run of 1891, a former government trader for the tribe, William Rea &quot;Billy&quot; Little, built a house, established his claim, and laid out town lots. The town got a post office on November 10, 1891, and was named for Marshall Cushing, private secretary to U.S. Postmaster General John Wanamaker.

In 1902, the Eastern Oklahoma Railway line to Cushing was built. The Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway added service on its own line built in 1903.

Wildcatter Thomas B. Slick started an oil boom on March 17, 1912, when he brought in a gusher east of Cushing. Other wells were soon drilled nearby, and the oil field became known as the Cushing-Drumright Oil Field. The city became a center for exploration of and production from nearby oil fields and also a refining center, when Consumers Oil Company opened a refinery in 1913. Production centered on the new town of Drumright, and Cushing became a refining center. Eventually, 23 oil companies and five oil-field supply houses located in the town, and more than 50 refineries once operated in the Cushing area. Pipelines and storage facilities have since made it &quot;the pipeline crossroads of the world&quot;.

The oil boom did not last long. Production peaked in 1915 with 8.3 million barrels of oil, but went down by 50% in 1916.

During the 1970s and 1980s refining operations continued in Cushing until the last two refineries, Kerr-McGee and Hudson, closed. Rail service ended in 1982.
As the oil fields started to run dry, starting in the 1940s, production and refining became less important.

The town retained a great asset in the Shell pipeline terminal, with 39 storage tanks and pipelines that could move as much as 1.5 million barrels a day. This enhanced Cushing&#x27;s status as &quot;Pipeline Crossroads of the World.&quot;

The maze of pipelines and tanks that had been built led to the NYMEX choosing Cushing as the official delivery point for its light sweet crude futures contract in 1983.

In May 2023, Cushing was selected as the site for a $5.56 billion crude oil refinery for processing 250,000 barrels per day of light and sweet crudes into low-carbon transportation fuels. The next-generation refinery, built with a goal of zero-carbon footprint operation, should be operational in 2027.

==History==
Glencoe was founded in 1899 with the establishment of the Glenco Post Office on the Eastern Oklahoma Railway. The first lots were sold on April 15, 1900. After J. Hunter Williams, editor of the &quot;Glencoe Mirror&quot;, was named postmaster on January 4, 1901, he persuaded the U.S. Post Office Department to change the spelling of the town&#x27;s name to Glencoe. Also that year, Glencoe was reported to be a sundown town, prohibiting African Americans from living or stopping in the town. In its early history Glencoe served as a trading center for the area and agriculture was the mainstay of the local economy. On January 22, 1914, a fire swept through downtown and destroyed most of the business district. While some businesses were rebuilt, the town&#x27;s future growth was negatively affected by the fire.

<doc id="130515" wikidata="Q2920915" url="?curid=130515" title="Ripley, Oklahoma">
<text>Ripley is a town in southeastern Payne County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 423 at the 2010 census, a decline of 9.2 percent from the figure of 444 in 2000. The town was named after Edward Ripley, the 14th president of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.

==History==
The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (often called simply the Santa Fe) developed Ripley and auctioned the first lots on January 13, 1900. Three months later, the &quot;Ripley Times&quot;, reported that the community&#x27;s population had already reached 1,000 persons. The first wagon bridge across the Cimarron River was completed July 31, 1900, which was the excuse for a big party that lasted until the wee hours of the next morning.

Agriculture became the main source of income besides the railroad. A large farm named Morehead Plantation hired many African-American laborers to produce cotton. The cotton business declined sharply after World War I, but oil discoveries in the county offset the cotton decline for a while. However, oil markets declined in the late 1920s and the beginning of the Great Depression caused the town economy to decline. Ripley&#x27;s population declined from a peak of 487 in 1930 to 292 in 1950 and 263 in 1960. The population rebounded to 451 in 1980 and 376 in 1990. It peaked again in 2009 at 510; by 2016, it dropped to 403 people.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

<doc id="130516" wikidata="Q852714" url="?curid=130516" title="Stillwater, Oklahoma">
<text>Stillwater is the tenth-largest city in the U.S. state of Oklahoma, and the seat of Payne County. It is located in north-central Oklahoma at the intersection of U.S. Route 177 and State Highway 51. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 48,394. The Stillwater Micropolitan Statistical Area had a population of 78,399 according to the 2012 census estimate. Stillwater was part of the first Oklahoma Land Run held on April 22, 1889, when the Unassigned Lands were opened for settlement and became the core of the new Oklahoma Territory. The city charter was adopted on August 24, 1889, and operates under a council-manager government system.

Stillwater has a diverse economy with a foundation in aerospace, agribusiness, biotechnology, optoelectronics, printing and publishing, and software and standard manufacturing. Stillwater is home to the main campus of Oklahoma State University (the city&#x27;s largest employer) as well as Northern Oklahoma College – Stillwater, Meridian Technology Center, and the Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education. The city is also home to the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum.

==History==
The north-central region of Oklahoma became part of the United States with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. In 1832, author and traveler Washington Irving provided the first recorded description of the area around Stillwater in his book &quot;A Tour on the Prairies&quot;. He wrote of &quot;a glorious prairie spreading out beneath the golden beams of an autumnal sun. The deep and frequent traces of buffalo, showed it to be a one of their favorite grazing grounds.&quot;
According to one legend, local Native American tribes—Ponca, Kiowa, Osage, Pawnee—called the creek &quot;Still Water&quot; because the water was always still. A second legend states that cattlemen driving herds from Texas to railways back east always found water &quot;still there&quot;. A third legend holds that David L. Payne walked up to Stillwater Creek and said, &quot;This town should be named &quot;Still Water&quot;&quot;. Members of the board thought he was crazy, but the name stuck.

Stillwater Creek received its official name in 1884 when William L. Couch established his &quot;boomer colony&quot; on its banks. While the creek itself was tranquil, the next few years saw turmoil as pioneers sought free, fertile land and soldiers held them off while complicated legal issues and land titles with Creek and Seminole tribes were hashed out. On April 22, 1889, the cannons fired signaling the first Land Run that opened up the Unassigned Lands of the Oklahoma Territory, which included Stillwater. By the end of the day, had been claimed and designated as Stillwater Township and a tent city with a population numbering 300 had sprung up on the prairie. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot; simply says that the name officially became Stillwater only when the post office opened on May 28, 1889.

On Christmas Eve, 1890, the legislature of Oklahoma Territory passed a bill certifying Stillwater as the land grant college site. In 1894, Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College held a dedication of its first brick building, Assembly Building, later known as Old Central. Between 1889 and statehood, Stillwater grew. By statehood in 1907, downtown Stillwater was home to more than 50 buildings including several banks, churches, grocery stores, hotels, and department stores.

The first newspaper was the Stillwater Gazette; telephone and gas service arrived in 1899; and the Eastern Oklahoma Railroad arrived in 1900.

Around this time, direct descendants of Johann Sebastian Bach began to reside in Stillwater, through his eldest son Wilhelm Friedemann Bach and his illegitimate grandchild.

The population in 1917 was 3,000 and by World War II it had grown to more than 10,000. During the war, town leaders&#x27; aim was to convert Oklahoma A&amp;M into a war training center. They succeeded in creating 12 training units that involved bringing nearly 40,000 service men and women to Stillwater. The WAVES (Women&#x27;s Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service) was the largest with 10,000 participants. Quonset huts were dotted across town and barracks occupied the site where Stillwater Medical Center and the CareerTech headquarters are now. This vast operation tided the city through the war and served as a base for a healthy economy in the postwar period. In 1952, the Industrial Foundation was established and its trustees worked to bring new industry to town: Moore Plant in 1966, Swan Hose in 1968, Mercury Marine in 1973, National Standard plant in 1988, World Color Press in 1974 and Armstrong World Industries, Inc. in 1988. The census of 2000, the population was 39,065; however, the population was adjusted to 46,156 in 2009.

==Government==

<text>Yale is a city in Payne County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,059 at the 2020 census, a decline of 13.6 percent from the figure of 1,227 in 2010.

==History==

Yale&#x27;s founding in 1895 is attributed to a local farmer, Sterling F. Underwood, who established a post office by that name in his general store, about east of the present town. When the Eastern Oklahoma Railway built its line across Payne County, a group led by George W. Canfield began a different townsite also within Eagle Township that would be closer to the railroad, at its planned junction with the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad. Underwood moved his store to the new site in 1902, making the new site the permanent location for the town of Yale. A 1907 map shows the town contained 230 acres surrounding the railroad junction, and to its east southeast the Underwood farm of 158 acres. By 1910, Yale had a population of 685, supported mostly by agricultural services and cotton processing.

On September 23, 1913, an oil well on the Randle farm produced a gusher. An even larger gusher began producing a month later. More discoveries followed. By the end of 1914, the combined Yale and Cushing fields were producing 220,000 barrels a day. The town boomed, attaining a population of 2,601 by the census of 1920.

The oil boom quickly deflated. Production began to decline sharply in 1915, and more dry holes were reported. Major producers began to shut down or reduce operations in the early 1920s. By 1930, the population had dropped to 1,734. In 1940, the census reported a population of 1,407. The decline continued until reaching a low of 1,239 in 1970. There was a spike by 1980, when the census recorded 1,652, but the downward trend resumed through 2010. Town officials have tried to stem the decline by promoting Yale as a retirement location.

== History ==
Residents of the young community applied for a United States Post Office to be established using the name &quot;Pearl City.&quot; Postal officials did not agree to their choice of names, doubtless because of the existence of a post office at Pearl in Woodward County, Oklahoma Territory. Federal officials were already anticipating the union of the &quot;twin territories&quot; into a single state, and postal officials did not want two post offices in the same state using such similar names. They substituted Ashland instead, and a post office opened at Ashland, Indian Territory on October 1, 1902. At the time of its founding, Ashland was located in Tobucksy County, Choctaw Nation.

<text>Haileyville is a city in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 716 at the time of the 2020 United States census.

==History==
Located in Pittsburg County, Haileyville lies at the junction of U.S. Route 270#OklahomaU.S. Route 270/State Highway 1 and State Highway 63, fourteen miles east of McAlester and a little more than one mile west of Hartshorne. The French explorer Jean Baptiste Bénard de La Harpe first mapped the site of Haileyville in 1719 during his expedition to the Arkansas River. In 1898 D. M. Hailey, M.D., established the town of Haileyville, when he claimed a tract of land east of McAlester and opened the area&#x27;s first coal mines. A Confederate veteran, Hailey had first moved into Indian Territory in 1868 to practice medicine and before long had become involved in several business ventures. His mining investments began when he and James Elliot started the Hailey-Ola Mining Company, leasing coal land from the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad, which laid tracks in the area in 1889–90. The first mine, named Number One Slope, began production on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day in 1899.

Haileyville, in the Choctaw Nation, was a company town, which was a common feature of coal-mining communities. Italians, American Indians, Russians, and Americans comprised most of Haileyville, and many worked in the mines or on the railroads. Coal from the area was only profitable due to the railroad junction. The town was home to the freight and passenger offices of the Choctaw, Oklahoma, and Gulf Railroad, which later became the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway Company (Rock Island). By 1902 the railroad had 1,052 miles of track, including a branch from the town that ran to Ardmore. Haileyville remained the division point of the Rock Island Railroad until 1958, when the offices moved to El Reno.

On April 20, 1901, the U.S. Post Office Department established a post office at Haileyville, Indian Territory. The 1907 population stood at 1,452, and it climbed to 2,024 in 1910. In 1911 a bank, the New State newspaper, five hotels, three doctors, and several retail and other businesses served the residents. The community and its close neighbor, Hartshorne, are known as the &quot;twin cities&quot; of Pittsburg County due to their proximity. Governor Lee Cruce proclaimed Haileyville a first class city on February 12, 1912. After a 2,067 population in 1920, the number of residents declined to 1,801 in 1930, 1,183 in 1940, and 922 in 1960. In 1946 one coal company, a bank, and an ice plant were the main businesses, with gas stations, grocery stores, and a hardware store. After the coal mines closed, lumber, farming, and ranching became the primary modes of production.

At the time of its founding, Haileyville was located in Gaines County, a part of the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

<text>Hartshorne (pronounced &quot;Hearts-orn&quot;) is a city in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma, United States. It is the third largest city in the county. The population was 1,947 at the time of the 2020 United States census.

==Description==
The community was named for Dr. Charles Hartshorne, a wealthy investor from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who was attracted by the potential profits offered by coal deposits in the area.

==History==
The present-day city of Hartshorne began as a coal mining community about 1850. Coal mine operators in the Indian Territory recruited European immigrants to work the mines. The first workers were probably English and Irish, but other ethnic groups soon joined them. These included Italians and eastern Europeans. Like many other such communities, this was a company town, built very close to the mine, with rudimentary houses and a company store.

A post office opened at Hartshorne, Indian Territory on March 5, 1850. It was named for Dr. Charles Hartshorne, a railroad official. Jones Academy was established southwest of Hartshorne in 1881. At the time of its founding, Hartshorne was located in Gaines County, a part of the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

The Choctaw Coal and Railway (CC&amp;R) line, acquired by the town, was incorporated in 1887 and began building a line between Wister and South McAlester. In 1894, the CC&amp;R was reorganized and renamed the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad (CO&amp;G) in 1894. The Wister - South McAlester line was completed in 1900, and also linked to Wilburton, Alderson and Hartshorne. In 1902, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway gained control of the CO&amp;G. In 1904 an electric interurban began service from McAlester to Hartshorne.

The Holy Rosary Church, complete with a rectory, a convent, and a parochial school, was built in 1895 by Russian and other Eastern European immigrants. Other churches constructed before the 20th Century were: Baptist, Methodist, Christian, Presbyterian, and Episcopal. The Saints Cyril and Methodius Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church, remains a landmark. Completed in 1916, it replaced an earlier 1897 version that immigrants from Russia and other eastern European countries constructed.

The Saints Cyril and Methodius church had been owned by the Sts. Cyril Methodius Orthodox Church, Inc. On March 20, 2016, a man named Bill Melancon filed a quitclaim deed in the Pittsburg County Clerk&#x27;s office, transferring ownership of the property to Melancon. The quitclaim deed had been signed by Bill O&#x27;Nesky, a church member, who Melancon claimed was a church trustee. Melanin also presented a Special Warranty Deed dated in 2010, by Bill O’Nesky, Tanya O’Nesky, and Foy Ledbetter, identified as successor trustees of the church. A group of church members first learned about the alleged sale soon afterward, when they found strangers on and inside the property. They filed suit in District Court. The case came before Judge James Bland in April 2016. Judge Bland issued a restraining order to bar Melancon, his agents and representatives from coming on or within of the property, or removing anything or making any changes before Bland revisited the case in June 2010. An out of court settlement between the church members before the date set by the judge resulted in the dismissal of the case, and a deed signed by Melanin transferring ownership back to the church.

The community incorporated in Tobucksy County of the Choctaw Nation by order of the U.S. District Court, Central District, Indian Territory, on March 1, 1900.

Hartshorne became part of Pittsburg County at statehood on November 16, 1907.

<text>Indianola is a town in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 162 at the 2010 census, a loss of 15.2 percent compared to 191 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Indianola probably began in 1875, when H. M. McElhany moved to the area and opened a one-room store. The store also served as a mail drop for local residents. The mail was delivered by horseback from the nearby town of Canadian, Oklahoma. McElhany stayed in business for about three years, then sold the store to Albert S. Cornelison and James H. Bynum. An actual post office was established at Indianola, Indian Territory on January 16, 1891, with Bynum being appointed as the first postmaster.

At the time of its founding, Indianola was located in Tobucksy County, Choctaw Nation.

According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, there are two versions of how the community acquired its name. One version says the name was on a stove in the general store. The other version says that the name honored Indianola, Mississippi.

The first school in Indianola was organized in February 1895. In 1898, Lyman H. Perkins, a Choctaw farmer who had originally all the land on which Indianola was built, donated for construction of a Methodist church. In 1902, the Fort Smith and Western Railway
built a track north of town. Indianola quickly relocated to be adjacent to the track, and the residents built a new school building. Lyman Perkins and his wife donated to the new town, which retained the name Indianola. The former site was simply called &quot;Old Town.&quot; By 1910, the community claimed 781 residents, which was the all-time high.

==Geography==
Indianola is located on the south bank of the South Canadian River, approximately north of McAlester. 

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. Indianola is 211 meters above sea level.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 191 people, 72 households, and 52 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 76 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 90.58% White, 6.28% Native American, and 3.14% from two or more races.

<doc id="130526" wikidata="Q855112" url="?curid=130526" title="Riemann curvature tensor">
<text>In the mathematical field of differential geometry, the Riemann curvature tensor or Riemann–Christoffel tensor (after Bernhard Riemann and Elwin Bruno Christoffel) is the most common way used to express the curvature of Riemannian manifolds. It assigns a tensor to each point of a Riemannian manifold (i.e., it is a tensor field). It is a local invariant of Riemannian metrics that measures the failure of the second covariant derivatives to commute. A Riemannian manifold has zero curvature if and only if it is &quot;flat&quot;, i.e. locally isometric to the Euclidean space. The curvature tensor can also be defined for any pseudo-Riemannian manifold, or indeed any manifold equipped with an affine connection.

It is a central mathematical tool in the theory of general relativity, the modern theory of gravity. The curvature of spacetime is in principle observable via the geodesic deviation equation. The curvature tensor represents the tidal force experienced by a rigid body moving along a geodesic in a sense made precise by the Jacobi equation.

== Definition ==
Let formula_1 be a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold, and formula_2 be the space of all vector fields on formula_3. We define the Riemann curvature tensor as a map formula_4 by the following formula where formula_5 is the Levi-Civita connection:
: formula_6
or equivalently
: formula_7
where formula_8 is the Lie bracket of vector fields and formula_9 is a commutator of differential operators. It turns out that the right-hand side actually only depends on the value of the vector fields formula_10 at a given point, which is notable since the covariant derivative of a vector field also depends on the field values in a neighborhood of the point. Hence, formula_11 is a formula_12-tensor field. For fixed formula_13, the linear transformation formula_14 is also called the &quot;curvature transformation&quot; or &quot;endomorphism&quot;. Occasionally, the curvature tensor is defined with the opposite sign.

The curvature tensor measures &quot;noncommutativity of the covariant derivative&quot;, and as such is the integrability obstruction for the existence of an isometry with Euclidean space (called, in this context, &quot;flat&quot; space). 

Since the Levi-Civita connection is torsion-free, its curvature can also be expressed in terms of the second covariant derivative
: formula_15
which depends only on the values of formula_16 at a point.
The curvature can then be written as
: formula_17
Thus, the curvature tensor measures the noncommutativity of the second covariant derivative. In abstract index notation, formula_18The Riemann curvature tensor is also the commutator of the covariant derivative of an arbitrary covector formula_19 with itself:
: formula_20

This formula is often called the &quot;Ricci identity&quot;. This is the classical method used by Ricci and Levi-Civita to obtain an expression for the Riemann curvature tensor. This identity can be generalized to get the commutators for two covariant derivatives of arbitrary tensors as follows 
: formula_21

This formula also applies to tensor densities without alteration, because for the Levi-Civita (&quot;not generic&quot;) connection one gets:
: formula_22 
where 
: formula_23

It is sometimes convenient to also define the purely covariant version of the curvature tensor by
:formula_24

== Geometric meaning ==
=== Informally ===
One can see the effects of curved space by comparing a tennis court and the Earth. Start at the lower right corner of the tennis court, with a racket held out towards north. Then while walking around the outline of the court, at each step make sure the tennis racket is maintained in the same orientation, parallel to its previous positions. Once the loop is complete the tennis racket will be parallel to its initial starting position. This is because tennis courts are built so the surface is flat. On the other hand, the surface of the Earth is curved: we can complete a loop on the surface of the Earth. Starting at the equator, point a tennis racket north along the surface of the Earth. Once again the tennis racket should always remain parallel to its previous position, using the local plane of the horizon as a reference. For this path, first walk to the north pole, then walk sideways (i.e. without turning), then down to the equator, and finally walk backwards to your starting position. Now the tennis racket will be pointing towards the west, even though when you began your journey it pointed north and you never turned your body. This process is akin to parallel transporting a vector along the path and the difference identifies how lines which appear &quot;straight&quot; are only &quot;straight&quot; locally. Each time a loop is completed the tennis racket will be deflected further from its initial position by an amount depending on the distance and the curvature of the surface. It is possible to identify paths along a curved surface where parallel transport works as it does on flat space. These are the geodesics of the space, for example any segment of a great circle of a sphere.

The concept of a curved space in mathematics differs from conversational usage. For example, if the above process was completed on a cylinder one would find that it is not curved overall as the curvature around the cylinder cancels with the flatness along the cylinder, which is a consequence of Gaussian curvature and Gauss&#x27;s Theorema Egregium. A familiar example of this is a floppy pizza slice, which will remain rigid along its length if it is curved along its width.

The Riemann curvature tensor is a way to capture a measure of the intrinsic curvature. When you write it down in terms of its components (like writing down the components of a vector), it consists of a multi-dimensional array of sums and products of partial derivatives (some of those partial derivatives can be thought of as akin to capturing the curvature imposed upon someone walking in straight lines on a curved surface).

=== Formally ===
When a vector in a Euclidean space is parallel transported around a loop, it will again point in the initial direction after returning to its original position. However, this property does not hold in the general case. The Riemann curvature tensor directly measures the failure of this in a general Riemannian manifold. This failure is known as the non-holonomy of the manifold.

Let formula_25 be a curve in a Riemannian manifold formula_3. Denote by formula_27 the parallel transport map along formula_25. The parallel transport maps are related to the covariant derivative by
: formula_29
for each vector field formula_30 defined along the curve.

Suppose that formula_31 and formula_30 are a pair of commuting vector fields. Each of these fields generates a one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms in a neighborhood of formula_33. Denote by formula_34 and formula_35, respectively, the parallel transports along the flows of formula_31 and formula_30 for time formula_38. Parallel transport of a vector formula_39 around the quadrilateral with sides formula_40, formula_41, formula_42, formula_43 is given by
: formula_44

The difference between this and formula_45 measures the failure of parallel transport to return formula_45 to its original position in the tangent space formula_47. Shrinking the loop by sending formula_48 gives the infinitesimal description of this deviation:
: formula_49
where formula_11 is the Riemann curvature tensor.

== Coordinate expression ==
Converting to the tensor index notation, the Riemann curvature tensor is given by
: formula_51
where formula_52 are the coordinate vector fields. The above expression can be written using Christoffel symbols:
: formula_53

(See also &quot;List of formulas in Riemannian geometry&quot;).

== Symmetries and identities ==
The Riemann curvature tensor has the following symmetries and identities:

where the bracket formula_54 refers to the inner product on the tangent space induced by the metric tensor and
the brackets and parentheses on the indices denote the antisymmetrization and symmetrization operators, respectively. If there is nonzero torsion, the Bianchi identities involve the torsion tensor.

The first (algebraic) Bianchi identity was discovered by Ricci, but is often called the first Bianchi identity or algebraic Bianchi identity, because it looks similar to the differential Bianchi identity.

The first three identities form a complete list of symmetries of the curvature tensor, i.e. given any tensor which satisfies the identities above, one can find a Riemannian manifold with such a curvature tensor at some point. Simple calculations show that such a tensor has formula_55 independent components. Interchange symmetry follows from these. The algebraic symmetries are also equivalent to saying that &quot;R&quot; belongs to the image of the Young symmetrizer corresponding to the partition 2+2.

On a Riemannian manifold one has the covariant derivative formula_56 and the Bianchi identity (often called the second Bianchi identity or differential Bianchi identity) takes the form of the last identity in the table.

== Ricci curvature ==
The Ricci curvature tensor is the contraction of the first and third indices of the Riemann tensor.
: formula_57

== Special cases ==
=== Surfaces ===
For a two-dimensional surface, the Bianchi identities imply that the Riemann tensor has only one independent component, which means that the Ricci scalar completely determines the Riemann tensor. There is only one valid expression for the Riemann tensor which fits the required symmetries:
: formula_58
and by contracting with the metric twice we find the explicit form:
: formula_59
where formula_60 is the metric tensor and formula_61 is a function called the Gaussian curvature and formula_62, formula_63, formula_64 and formula_65 take values either 1 or 2. The Riemann tensor has only one functionally independent component. The Gaussian curvature coincides with the sectional curvature of the surface. It is also exactly half the scalar curvature of the 2-manifold, while the Ricci curvature tensor of the surface is simply given by
: formula_66

=== Space forms ===
A Riemannian manifold is a space form if its sectional curvature is equal to a constant formula_67. The Riemann tensor of a space form is given by
: formula_68

Conversely, except in dimension 2, if the curvature of a Riemannian manifold has this form for some function formula_67, then the Bianchi identities imply that formula_67 is constant and thus that the manifold is (locally) a space form.

<text>Krebs is a city in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 2,083 at the time of the 2020 United States census, up 1.5% from the 2,053 reported at the 2010 census, which in turn was a slight increase from the 2,051 reported in 2000. Its nickname is &quot;Little Italy.&quot; Krebs was founded before Oklahoma statehood as a coal-mining town in the Choctaw Nation of Indian Territory.

==History==
A post office was established at Krebs, Indian Territory on February 10, 1886. At the time of its founding, Krebs was located in Tobucksy County, a part of the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation. Krebs began as a coal-mining camp housing European immigrants who came to work coal mines in the surrounding area. The town is named after Judge Edmond Folsom Krebs (1821-1893), a county judge in Tobucksy County. Judge Krebs was born of mixed German and Choctaw ancestry in Winston County, Mississippi.

===1892 mining explosion ===
An explosion in the Osage Coal &amp; Mining Company’s No. 11 mine on January 7, 1892 killed about 100 workers and injured another 150, but mining continued to prosper. By 1895, there were 15 mines operating nearby. The first local of the United Mine Workers in Indian Territory was founded in the town in 1898. Krebs was linked to McAlester by the Choctaw Railway and Lighting Company interurban railroad.

===Early Krebs===
Krebs was incorporated in the Choctaw Nation in 1903, with Mel D. Reed elected as the first mayor and Bob Miller as the first chief of police. The current St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church was constructed in 1903. It and an opera house were the first two brick buildings in town. An earlier church and the first opera house, both built of wood, had previously burned down.

The Krebs school system was organized in 1907, the same year that the Choctaw Nation and Indian Territory governments were replaced by the new State of Oklahoma.

The Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad (also known as the MKT or &quot;Katy&quot;) built a branch from McAlester to Wilburton, on which it ran a two-coach train known affectionately as &quot;Nellie.&quot; The Katy station was in downtown Krebs. Later, another station was built south of town on the East-West line to serve the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad (a.k.a. CRI&amp;P or Rock Island.) For a time, there was also an electric interurban line from McAlester through Krebs to Hartshorne.

Krebs had five newspapers at different times: Krebs &quot;Eagle&quot;, Krebs &quot;Cyclone&quot;, Krebs &quot;Banner&quot;, Krebs &quot;Advertiser&quot;, and &quot;The Oklahoma Miner.&quot;

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and 0.29% is water. 

Krebs is east of McAlester, the county seat, on U.S. Route 270 and State Highway 31.

==Notable places==
The Krebs Opera House was re-built as a brick structure in 1903, after the first one had been destroyed by fire the previous year. It and the St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church were the first brick buildings to go up in Krebs. It was the only place for miles around that featured stage shows. Many fine road shows played here, and moving pictures were shown in the Opera House, also. The Dreamland Theater, owned and operated by Mr. &amp; Mrs. David Holstead, later became the popular movie theater in Krebs. The original wooden St. Joseph&#x27;s Church also burned in 1902, and was replaced by a brick church in 1903. It has been completely refurbished in recent years.

Also taking place in town was the Terrapin Derby, originated in 1929 when Mayor J.T. Sadler visited the Miller Brothers Shows in Ponca City, Oklahoma. Mayor Sadler brought the idea back to Krebs as a fundraising idea. The derby was a success, and enough money was raised to purchase a new truck for the city. Over the years the derby raised funds that provided vehicles and equipment for one of the finest volunteer fire departments in the region.

Krebs had an Italian Band that played in a double-decker bandstand in downtown Krebs. There were at least five bandstands between McAlester and Hartshorne that the band played at on weekends, providing entertainment for families from all over. Many families rode the street car to these sites for picnics and festivals.

The city of Krebs maintains a city park which includes a baseball park, a one-kilometer (0.6-mile) walking track, picnic facilities, a two-story replica of the gazebo that had stood in the town square, and will include playground equipment. The park stands on a portion of the old fairground/racetrack site of a hundred years ago. The original racetrack was a , banked oval track where horses, sulkys, and early autos were raced. The Krebs Italian Band played many festivals or &#x27;festas&#x27; at the park in bygone simpler times. For years during the 1990s, &quot;The Ethnic Festival&quot; was a popular attraction on Labor Day weekend, taking place on this Historical Site. Games such as bocce ball and morra were played by all for fun.

<text>McAlester is the county seat of Pittsburg County, Oklahoma. The population was 18,363 at the time of the 2010 census, a 3.4 percent increase from 17,783 at the 2000 census. The town gets its name from James Jackson McAlester, an early settler and businessman who later became lieutenant governor of Oklahoma. Known as &quot;J. J.&quot;, McAlester married Rebecca Burney, the daughter of a full-blood Chickasaw family, which made him a citizen of the Chickasaw Nation.

McAlester is the home of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, the former site of an &quot;inside the walls&quot; prison rodeo that ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot; once broadcast. The prison&#x27;s nickname, Big Mac, was derived from its location in the town.

McAlester is home to many of the employees of the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant. This facility makes the majority of the bombs used by the United States military. In 1998 McAlester became the home of the Defense Ammunition Center (DAC), which moved from Savanna, Illinois, to McAlester Army Ammunition Plant.

==History==

The crossing of the east–west California Road with the north–south Texas Road formed a natural point of settlement. At the time of its founding, the site was located in Tobucksy County, a part of the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation. Alyssia Young, who emigrated from Mississippi to the Indian Territory, first established a settlement at the intersection of the two roads in 1838. The town was named Perryville after James Perry, member of a Choctaw family, who established a trading post. At one time Perryville was the capital of the Choctaw Nation and County Seat of Tobucksy County. During the American Civil War, the Choctaw allied with the Confederate States of America (CSA) as the war reached Indian Territory.

A depot providing supplies to Confederate Forces in Indian Territory was set up at Perryville. On August 26, 1863, a force of 4,500 Union soldiers crossed the Canadian River and destroyed the Confederate munitions depot at Perryville. This became known as the Battle of Perryville, Indian Territory. Union Major General James G. Blunt, finding the Confederate supplies and realizing that Perryville was a major supply depot for Confederate forces, ordered the town burned. The town was rebuilt but never reached its prewar glory or population.

After the end of the Civil War in 1865, Captain J. J. McAlester obtained a job with the trading company of Reynolds and Hannaford. McAlester convinced the firm to locate a general store at Tupelo in the Choctaw Nation. He had learned of coal deposits in Indian Territory during the war while serving as a captain with the 22nd Arkansas Infantry Regiment (Confederate). At Fort Smith, Arkansas, before going to work with Reynolds and Hannaford, McAlester had received maps of the coal deposits from engineer Oliver Weldon, who served with McAlester during the war.

Weldon had worked for the U.S. surveying Indian Territory before the war and knew of the coal deposits. Hearing of the railroad plans to extend through Indian Territory and knowing that rich deposits of coal were in an area north of the town of Perryville, McAlester convinced Reynolds and Hannaford that Bucklucksy would be a more suitable and profitable site for the trading post. He constructed a trading post/general store there in late 1869. The Bucklucksy general store was an immediate success, but McAlester recognized an even greater opportunity in the abundance of coal deposits in the area, so he began obtaining rights to the deposits from the Choctaws, anticipating the impending construction of a rail line through Indian Territory.

As the first railroad to extend its line to the northern border of Indian Territory, the Union Pacific Railway Southern Branch earned right of way and a liberal bonus of land to extend the line to Texas. Several New York businessmen, including Levi P. Morton, Levi Parsons, August Belmont, J. Pierpont Morgan, George Denison and John D. Rockefeller, were interested in extending rail through Indian Territory, and the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, familiarly called the Katy Railroad, began its corporate existence in 1865 toward that end. Morton and Parsons selected a site near the Kansas Indian Territory border where they incorporated the settlement of Parsons, Kansas in 1871.

That same year, J. J. McAlester, after buying out Reynolds&#x27;s share of the trading post, journeyed with a sample of coal to the railroad town in hopes of persuading officials to locate the line near his store at Bucklucksy. The trading post&#x27;s location on the Texas Road weighed in its favor, given that the Katy line construction roughly followed the Shawnee Trail – Texas Road route south to the Red River. The line reached Bucklucksy in 1872, and Katy Railroad officials named the railway stop McAlester .

With the coming of the railroad, businesses in nearby Perryville began relocating to be near the McAlester Rail Depot, marking the end of Perryville and the beginning of McAlester. On August 22, 1872, J. J. McAlester married Rebecca Burney (1841–1919). She was a member of the Chickasaw Nation, which made it possible for McAlester to gain citizenship and the right to own property (including mineral rights to the coal deposits in both the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations). McAlester quickly obtained land near the intersection of the north–south and east–west rail lines, where he opened a second general store and continued selling coal to the railroads.

In 1885, Fritz Sittle (Sittel), a Choctaw citizen by marriage and one of the first settlers in the area, urged visiting newspaperman Edwin D. Chadick to pursue the possibility of an east–west rail line to run through the coal mining district at Krebs that would connect with the north–south line at McAlester. Chadick eventually found financing and established the Choctaw Coal and Railway in 1888, but was unable to come to terms with J. J. McAlester over the issue of right of way.

In the 1870s, miners from Pennsylvania arrived in McAlester to work in the coal mines. Miners of Italian origin arrived in McAlester in 1874.

Chadick and his investors purchased land to the south of McAlester&#x27;s General Store, and a natural trading crossroads formed where the two rail lines crossed, quickly becoming a bustling community called South McAlester. South McAlester grew much more rapidly than North McAlester. The 1900 census showed a population of 3,470 for the former and 642 for the latter.

The two towns operated as somewhat separate communities until 1907, when the United States Congress passed an act joining them as a single municipality, the action being required since the towns were under federal jurisdiction in Indian Territory. McAlester and South McAlester were combined under the single name McAlester, with South McAlester officeholders as officials of the single town. Designation as a single community by the United States Post Office came on July 1, 1907, nearly five months before Oklahoma statehood, which caused a redrawing of county lines and designations such that the majority of Tobucksy County fell within the new lines of Pittsburg County. The city had 8,144 inhabitants upon statehood, more than a fourth of whom were foreign-born.

McAlester was on the route of the Jefferson Highway established in 1915, with that road running more than 2,300 miles from Winnipeg, Manitoba to New Orleans, Louisiana.

McAlester was the site of the 2004 trial of Terry Nichols on Oklahoma state charges related to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. On December 25, 2000, an ice storm hit the area, leaving residents without electrical service and water for more than two weeks; in January 2007, another devastating ice storm crippled the city, leaving residents without power and water for more than a week.

==Economy==
Agriculture and coal mining supported the city&#x27;s economy around the turn of the 20th century. Cotton was the main cash crop, and McAlester had three cotton gins and one cotton compress. Then a boll weevil infestation destroyed local cotton production. Meanwhile, railroads converted from coal to oil as their primary fuel, which marked the decline of the coal industry in the area.

The Oklahoma State Penitentiary is a major source of employment and revenue in McAlester.

During World War II, the U.S. Government built the Naval Ammunition Plant a few miles south of McAlester. In 1977, the facility became the U.S. Army Ammunition Plant. It is still the main site of ammunition production and storage for the armed forces in the United States.

<text>Pittsburg is a town in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 280 at the 2000 census.

== History ==
The first settlement of present day Pittsburg by non-indigenous peoples was in 1899 when Daniel Edwards, accompanied by son Thomas, placed a coal shaft two miles east of Kiowa, in Choctaw Nation. In 1903, the United States Postal Service established a post office in Cowpers and appointed Daniel Edwards as postmaster.

<text>Savanna is a town in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 686 at the 2010 census, a decline of 6.0 percent from the figure of 730 recorded in 2000. It is the hometown of former Harlem Globetrotter and 2014 NAIA Dunk Champion Tyler Inman.

==History==
Begun as a rural settlement in Tobucksy County, Choctaw Nation during the 1860s, the community&#x27;s economy was based on agriculture and cattle ranching. Coal mining became the most important economic activity during the 1870s.

A post office was established at Savanna, Indian Territory on May 5, 1876. The town owed its existence to the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad, for which it was a station stop, and the new post office was named for the private railroad car used by Robert Stevens, general manager of the railroad.

As coal mining developed, the community became one of the largest in Indian Territory. The mining companies built rows of 2- and 3- bedroom houses for the families of the miners. In 1887, accidental explosions in Mines #1 and #2 killed 6 miners and 12 rescue personnel. The Savanna Coal Mining and Trading Company closed its mines and moved the houses it owned to Lehigh, Oklahoma. Some growth continued, and Savanna boasted 450 residents in 1911. The &quot;Savanna News&quot; began publishing in 1915, but went out of business before the end of the decade.

However, the demand for coal fell, as the country began shifting to oil and gas as preferred fuels. Coal mining never regained its former importance to Pittsburg County after WWI. Savanna&#x27;s boom essentially collapsed until after statehood came in 1907.

During World War II, the U.S. Navy constructed an ammunition production facility at McAlester. Many of Savanna&#x27;s work force went to work there. In 1960, the census reported a population of 620, which grew to 948 in 1990.

<text>Ada is a city in and the county seat of Pontotoc County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 16,481 at the 2020 United States Census. The city was named for Ada Reed, the daughter of an early settler, and was incorporated in 1901. Ada is home to East Central University, and is the capital of the Chickasaw Nation. Ada is an Oklahoma Main Street City, an Oklahoma Certified City, and a Tree City USA member.

==History==
In the late 1880s, the Daggs family (by way of Texas) became the first white family to settle what is now known as Ada, which was formerly known as Daggs Prairie. In April 1889, Jeff Reed (a Texan and relative of the Daggs family) was appointed to carry the mail from Stonewall to Center (which was later combined with Pickett), two small communities in then Indian Territory. With his family and his stock, he sought a place for a home on a prairie midway between the two points, where he constructed a log house and started Reed&#x27;s Store. Other settlers soon built homes nearby. In 1891, a post office was established and named after Reed&#x27;s oldest daughter, Ada. Ada incorporated as a city in 1901 and grew rapidly with the arrival of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway line. Within a decade the Santa Fe Railroad and the Oklahoma Central Railway also served the town.

Ada was originally a sundown town, where African Americans were not allowed to live. In the 1900s, the town was opened up to African Americans so that black witnesses could stay while testifying in district court. Ada began allowing Black people to open restaurants, barber shops, stores, and hotels by court order as to offer places where &quot;negro witnesses might stay during the [court] session&quot;. Unnamed individuals threatened them, writing that &quot;unless they left the town immediately they must suffer the consequences.&quot; When the threats went unanswered, unnamed parties blew up a Black restaurant with dynamite, seriously injuring one occupant. According to the &quot;Arkansas City Daily Traveler&quot; article, published on March 30, 1904, &quot;This action has been condemned by many citizens and a reward has been offered for arrest of the guilty parties...most citizens now believe negroes should be allowed to live there.&quot; After the incident, the town remained open to African Americans to provide labor for a local cotton compress.

In 1909, the women of Ada organized an effort to build a normal school in their city. It resulted in the founding of East Central College (now East Central University).

On April 19, 1909, an organized mob hanged four men, among whom was American outlaw Deacon Jim Miller, who was set to be tried for the murder of a former U.S. marshal and member of the local freemason lodge. The town had a population of about 5,000 at the time, and 38 murders a year at the time of the lynching. The &quot;Daily Ardmoreite&quot; reported that the four lynched men were &quot;one of the bloodiest band of murderers in the state of Oklahoma and an organization of professional assassins, that for a record of blood crimes, probably has no equal in the annals of criminal history in the entire southwest&quot;.

The first manufacturing company in Ada, the Portland Cement Company, installed the first cement clinker in Oklahoma in 1910. American Glass Casket Company began manufacturing glass caskets in 1916, but the business failed. Hazel Atlas Glass bought the plant in 1928 and produced glass products until 1991.

==In popular culture==
Because of its short, palindromic spelling with frequently used letters, Ada is a very common crossword puzzle answer. Associated clues often include &quot;Oklahoma city&quot;, &quot;Oklahoma palindrome&quot;, and &quot;Sooner State city.&quot;

==Controversies==
In 1987, journalist Robert Mayer published &quot;The Dreams of Ada&quot; exploring major flaws, irregularities, forced confessions, and possible miscarriages of justice in Ada in the convictions of Tommy Ward and Karl Fontenot for the rape and murder of Denice Haraway, who died in 1984.

In 2006, John Grisham brought Ada into the national spotlight in his nonfiction work &quot;The Innocent Man&quot;, relating a similar story in the convictions of Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz for the murder of Debra Sue Carter. After 12 years on death row, DNA evidence proved the men&#x27;s innocence and established the guilt of the prosecution&#x27;s main witness. Similar problems surrounded the trials of the two men convicted for the murder of Denice Haraway. Prosecutor Bill Peterson has self-published his disagreements with Grisham&#x27;s version of events.

In 2018, Grisham&#x27;s book was adapted into a Netflix series, also titled &quot;The Innocent Man&quot;, combining and extending the cases outlined in his and Mayer&#x27;s books.

==History==
An incorporated community in Pontotoc County, Roff is situated along State Highway 1, eighteen miles southwest of Ada and ninety-five miles southeast of Oklahoma City. The town was named for Joseph T. Roff, a rancher who moved from Texas to the Chickasaw Nation, Indian Territory, in 1871. Roff and his Choctaw wife and children settled near the present townsite in 1883. A community developed along the nearby Blue River soon after Roff began leasing his land to whites in 1885. A subscription school was established there in 1889 and a post office, designated Roff, opened in June 1890. Joseph Roff served as postmaster.

The St. Louis, Oklahoma and Southern Railway (purchased by the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway in 1901) was constructed just south of Roff in December 1900. As a result, the village was relocated along the line and surveyed the following spring. A townsite company was then organized and community lots were sold. Joseph Roff was the town&#x27;s first mayor.

Roff thrived as an agricultural community. Cotton gins, flour mills, and grain stores operated in town, and area farmers raised cotton, cattle, hogs, horses, and a variety of fruits. Other early businesses included a bottling works, a brick plant, and bakeries. The Mid-Continent Glass Sand Company was organized in 1912. Used in the manufacture of jars, tableware glasses, and containers, silicon dioxide (glass sand) remained a local export into the twenty-first century. The Roff Tribune, the Roff Enterprise, the Roff Eagle, and the Blue Valley Farmer were among the town&#x27;s newspapers.

Roff&#x27;s population was 1,079 at 1907 statehood. That number peaked at 1,138 in 1920. Roff&#x27;s decline began when crop prices fell during the 1920s and continued through the Great Depression and World War II. The First State Bank of Roff closed in 1934, leaving the community without a bank until the 1970s. Local rail passenger service ceased in 1960. The population dropped from 772 in 1930 to 632 in 1970, but rose to 729 in 1980.

Roff had 734 residents and fifteen commercial enterprises in 2000. Businesses included a restaurant, an automobile dealership, two gasoline stations with convenience stores, and a housing construction firm. In 2000 the Roff School District enrolled 330 students. The Roff National Guard Armory was listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NR 97001151).

<text>Stonewall is a town in Pontotoc County, Oklahoma, United States. Named for Confederate General Stonewall Jackson, the settlement&#x27;s post office was established in December 1874.

== History ==
Before Stonewall was a town, it was primarily the Chickasaw tribes land. Robert L. Cochran was a Georgia man who settled Stonewall first by opening up a trading post on the original site of Stonewall. The site was declared Pontotoc, which would become the county name in the present. Along with the settling of Cochran&#x27;s store a post office opened there in 1858. The settlement was then named Stonewall in honor of confederate war general Stonewall Jackson. By the late 1800s, Stonewall had increased in population and had multiple businesses open such as a cotton gin, good stores, a hotel, and stagecoach station.

In the early 1900s Stonewall was on the rise with the expansion of the railroad from Oklahoma City that passed through Ada. A debate was in place about whether they wanted to move the town closer to the railroad, but many didn&#x27;t want to leave due to Stonewall being a &quot;historically significant as the seat of Pontotoc County in the Chickasaw Nation, Indian Territory&quot;. Eventually some moved and the original site would be renamed to Frisco. The new Stonewall site was now official and with the recent move of businesses and post office, the population was thriving.

In 1930, Stonewall was unaffected by the Great Depression due to oil booms within the town. However, with the oil boom brought environmental destruction. The local creek was flooded with waste and polluted, causing locals to take action by digging wells. In 1932 Charles &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; Floyd and his accomplice George Birdwell robbed the Stonewall Bank. They escaped with $600 and had assaulted two bank officers. While on the run Floyd and Birdwell kidnapped a man on a motorcycle as they fled away from the town.

Today Stonewall is a smaller town after the reroute of Highway 3 away from the town, causing business to slow down and steady. There are a few businesses in the town; however, many people are employed in Ada.

==History==

===Beginnings===
Asher dates back to 1892 when George &quot;Matt&quot; Asher, from Clay County, Kentucky, purchased land in Oklahoma Territory from a Shawnee estate salesperson to set up his farm home. The post office was established November 26, 1901, when the postmaster of nearby Avoca, Oklahoma, George A. McCurry, moved the Avoca post office and his store to the new community that would become Asher. This was done without permission from the government and left Avoca without a post office. According to the tale, McCurry was given a home and store building as payment for moving the post office to the new settlement. The town was named for Mr. Asher, who supplied the land with the consideration the community would carry his namesake, though he never lived there. There was a sale of public lots in 1902.

===Avoca Township===
Asher is the last remaining post office in the original Avoca Township, which also included the towns of Sacred Heart Mission, Osmit, Avoca, Meanko, Boyer and Violet.

===Growth===

On October 12, 1900, the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf (CO&amp;G) bought the Shawnee to Tecumseh Railway branch from the Tecumseh Railway Co. and promptly extended the branch to Asher. For the next 40 years, Asher would serve as the termination point for the branch and its engine, &quot;Old Beck&quot;. Rapid construction of railroads opened up of a fertile section of the South Canadian River valley to shipping facilities. Asher was the trade center and market of the area. Further development came when, on January 15, 1903, The Jennings Company closed on 1,000 business and residence lots. The Jennings Company advertised investment in the growing town and new factories and industries of various kinds soon located in Asher.

Asher and the new settlers had hopes of creating a large city. However, the settlers were disappointed when the towns of Seminole and Konawa were built and took away much of Asher&#x27;s trade. The people of Asher would not give up, and pulled together town resources and constructed a bridge across the Canadian River. The state then used the bridge in its construction of State Highway 18, drawing a small amount of trade to the area from nearby cities, such as Ada. Before the construction of the bridge, those south of Asher could only cross the river when it was shallow enough.

Asher, originally a cotton farming community, suffered in its early years from crop losses caused by boll weevils. Farmers were then dealt a further blow when the town&#x27;s first two cotton gins were destroyed by fire. These setbacks compounded the loss of trade and left the town in dire straits.

In 1927, oil was discovered in and around the town. Asher sprang up almost overnight to serve the needs of the oil workers. It was also around this time that executives moved into Asher and purchased enormous amounts of supplies and merchandise at inflated prices. There were many businesses in town including feed and grocery stores, jewelry stores and drug stores as well as banks, barber shops, hotels and a small theater. Many leading families of Oklahoma, such as the McAlisters, the O&#x27;Dells, the Patterson&#x27;s, the Campbells and the Byruns, lived in the town. There were also many doctors with offices in Asher. For a while, Asher became prosperous.

===County Seat potential===
Tecumseh, Oklahoma, was originally the county seat of Pottawatomie County. In late 1930, a long-standing war between Shawnee and Tecumseh escalated when voters approved measures to move the seat to Shawnee. A spin-off of this feud was the move for the creation of a new county, to be named Petroleum County. The new county would be composed of prime oil-producing land, including the southern half of Pottawatomie County and portions of Seminole, Pontotoc and McClain Counties. The move was started by Tecumseh supporters who wanted to make Shawnee&#x27;s county seat victory as hollow as possible by removing the most valuable section of the county. Asher was slated to be the county seat and it was planned that the greater part of Tecumseh would move down to form an impressive community. There was a paper--&quot;The Petroleum County Times&quot;—produced, meetings held and petitions circulated. However, the measure never progressed further as times were not favorable for the creation of a new county.

===End of the oil boom===
The oil boom ended when only four wells proved to be profitable. Once again, Asher was in danger of dying out. Fortunately, another oil well was found just west of the town. This time the people connected to the well were local citizens and were cautious and conservative in their estimates and spending. This led to a small but steady production of oil in the community. Asher was dealt another setback in 1967 when SH-18 was taken out of commission and traffic was diverted west of town on the new US Highway 177. Businesses migrated to the new highway and many storefronts in the original town were closed. The final business, Green&#x27;s Market, which was located on Division Street (old SH-18) closed in 1985, after serving the community for 40 years. Several businesses on US-177 remain, mostly serving those traveling through the area.

===Centennial===
In 2001, Asher celebrated its 100th anniversary. The town, along with others in the county that had passed the centennial mark, was honored on a centennial monument dedicated September 21, 2007. This date was chosen to coincide with the Oklahoma Centennial. Other Asher honorees were the First Baptist Church, which was founded in 1902 and Asher School, which was established in 1903. The monument is located in Centennial Park, on the grounds of the Santa Fe Museum, in Shawnee, Oklahoma.

Asher Public Schools is an independent school district. It has an elementary school (grades Pre-K to 8) and a high school (grades 9 to 12). The school was established in 1903. In 1913, there were four other school districts within three miles (5 km) of Asher—Clover Dale, Gravel Hill, Avoca, and Pleasant Hill. The schools were small, consisting of only a room or two. Basic facilities were at a minimum. Talk began of consolidating all of the schools into the Asher district.

<doc id="130541" wikidata="Q2169299" url="?curid=130541" title="Brooksville, Oklahoma">
<text>Brooksville is a town in Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma, United States. It is one of the thirteen existing all-black towns in Oklahoma. The population was 63 at the 2010 census, a 30 percent decline from the figure of 90 in 2000.

==History==
One of more than fifty All-Black towns of Oklahoma, Brooksville is one of only thirteen still existing at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Located in Pottawatomie County southwest of Tecumseh, Brooksville was established in 1903. Originally the town was named Sewell, after a white doctor who owned much of the surrounding land and attended the residents. In 1909 the name changed to Brooksville in honor of the first African American in the area, A. R. Brooks, a cotton buyer and farmer. Brooks served as postmaster here from March 18, 1909, until January 27, 1913, at which time his son, William M. Brooks, became postmaster. In 1906 Rev. Jedson White organized St. John&#x27;s Baptist Church. Soon afterward, the congregation built a church that still exists. White also promoted the town throughout the South, urging African Americans to settle in Brooksville. Brooksville had a Santa Fe Railroad station, three hotels, two doctors, and two mills.

In 1924, with the aid of the Rosenwald Fund, a new school was built. Banneker School, under management of W. T. McKenzie, was a rock building of four large rooms, a three-hundred-seat auditorium, a small library, and a well-equipped domestic science room. George W. McLaurin, the first African American graduate student at the University of Oklahoma, taught at the school. After a fire, the original building was replaced by a wooden one that served students until the school closed in 1968. The building then became a community center for the town and stands next to the new city hall. A declining cotton market and the Great Depression made life difficult in Brooksville, as in many Oklahoma communities. Most of the residents departed, but the town survived. At the beginning of the twenty-first century Brooksville was steadily increasing in population.

<text>Earlsboro is a town in Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 594 by the 2020 United States census. It was once called &quot;...the town that whisky built and oil broke.&quot;

==History==
The town of Earlsborough (as it was spelled on the town plat) began in 1891, when the Choctaw Coal and Railway (later the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad) built a line west from the Seminole Nation into Oklahoma Territory.
The town was located one-half mile inside Oklahoma Territory. It was named for James Earls, a local African American who had served as an orderly for Confederate General Joseph Wheeler during the Civil War. The spelling of the town name changed when the Earlsboro post office opened on June 12, 1895.

The town had an economic boom from the outset because Indian Territory was legally &quot;dry,&quot; but Oklahoma Territory was not. The first three businesses were saloons, and it was said that 90 percent of the merchants were engaged in liquor sales. By 1905, the town had a population estimated at 500. Many customers were visitors from Indian Territory.

Statehood brought prohibition to all of Oklahoma, and the population of Earlsboro quickly dropped to 387. The local economy subsequently relied on agriculture instead of liquor. Oil was struck nearby on March 1, 1926. The first well produced 200 barrels a day. News of the strike attracted workers, and the town population increased to an estimated ten thousand people within two months. The ensuing boom led to construction of a one hundred thousand dollar hotel, a large theater, and many different kinds of business. In 1929, the town passed a $225,000 bond issue to construct a water and sewer system. The population was officially 1,950 at the 1930 census.

The oil boom turned into a bust when production declined precipitously in 1932. The newcomers, now deeply in debt, fled the scene, abandoning homes and businesses. The city went into bankruptcy, since it could no longer pay its debts. In 1959 the &quot;Daily Oklahoman&quot; reported that Earlsboro &quot;was the town that whisky built and oil broke.&quot;

On May 4, 2022, an EF2 tornado struck the southeastern part of town before looping around and striking the eastern half of the town, damaging homes, power lines, and buildings. An additional EF1 tornado began near the starting point of the first tornado, causing additional damage as it moved east.

<text>Pink is a town in Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma, United States, and is part of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area. The only town in the United States bearing this name, Pink lies within the boundaries of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation. The population was 2,091 at the time of the 2020 Census, which is 1.6% above the 2010 census figure of 2,058, which itself was a 76.7% increase from the figure of 1,165 in 2000.

The town name of Pink may have been chosen because it is complementary to Brown (now part of Pink), which was located a few miles east in the same township and range. This would be an example of the &quot;twin name fad&quot; in Pottawatomie County, like the towns of Romulus and Remus. Oral history suggests that the town name was in honor of a local resident named Pink.

The town was hit by a significant tornado on the night of April 19, 2023.

==History==

===Prehistory===
From the information gathered during archaeological excavations along the Little River west and south of Pink, it appears that people lived in this area for many thousands of years including during the four-thousand year drought of the Altithermal which started around 8,500 years ago and turned most of Oklahoma into a vast desert. The Thunderbird Dam Site on Little River west of Pink appears to have been used from around 500 BC to 1000 AD. Hunters found the ridge above the river a good camping spot near water and plentiful game animals including deer and turkey.

===1800-1891===
The Oklahoma region became part of the United States with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. The Indian Removal Act, signed into law by President Andrew Jackson in 1830, authorized the President to negotiate land exchange treaties with tribes located in lands of the United States. Relocation to Indian Territory began with the Five Civilized Tribes and soon expanded to other groups residing east of the Mississippi River.

====Citizen Potawatomi====

Originally driven west by the Iroqouis to the Lake Michigan area prior to 1640, the Potawatomi were driven out of their homes again during the Indian Removal. The Indiana Potawatomi were removed to Kansas and settled at St. Mary&#x27;s Mission, becoming known as the Mission Potawatomi. Taking up United States citizenship, they became the Citizen Potawatomi Nation. In 1867, the Citizen Potawatomi sold their Kansas lands in order to purchase land in Indian Territory in what would become Pottawatomie County, including Pink.

The Potawatomi arrived in Indian Territory to find Shawnee occupying their land. The Shawnee had been living along the Canadian River in the Choctaw and Creek nations since about 1845, and being absent from their Kansas reservation, they became known as the Absentee Shawnee. In 1872, the United States Congress gave the Absentee Shawnee title to the lands they occupied in the Citizen Potawatomi Nation. Two decades later, the Dawes Act of 1887 forced the Citizen Potawatomi, Absentee Shawnee, Sac &amp; Fox, and Iowa to accept individual allotments. After the allotments were completed, unoccupied land was opened to settlers in the Land Run of 1891, including land that would become the town of Pink.

====Absentee Shawnee====

One band of Absentee Shawnee led by Big Jim (Wapameepto), grandson of Tecumseh, opposed absorption into white society for fear of losing their cultural traditions. They had been living illegally north of the North Canadian River until November 1886 when soldiers from Fort Reno forced them to move south of the river to a place near Shawneetown. The soldiers burned their old houses and destroyed improvements they had made to the land so they could not return to their old homes. They wintered without shelter. Within three years they managed to build log houses and plant small fields and orchards amidst the White Turkeys, another band of Absentee Shawnees. By 1889 it was evident that the land they were now occupying would be broken up and sold.

Refusing to accept the notion of allotments, Big Jim&#x27;s Band removed themselves to what they considered the most distant and worthless part of the Citizen Pottawatomie Nation. Big Jim thought that white men would not be interested in the sandy hills near the confluence of Hog Creek and Little River, and would consequently leave them alone. It was a futile attempt to escape allotments, and in 1890 Big Jim and his followers were forced by the Cherokee Commission to accept 80-acre allotments of mostly sandy hills and overflowed bottomland. The community, known as Big Jim Settlement (population 184 in 1901), later became Little Axe in eastern Cleveland County. The original center of the settlement was flooded upon completion of Lake Thunderbird in 1965, ironically turning Big Jim&#x27;s &quot;worthless&quot; land into a desirable and popular state park.

The easternmost Big Jim Band allotments were in what is now the town of Pink. A number of these allotments are still intact, including 2,000 contiguous acres straddling the Pottawatomie/Cleveland county line on the north and south sides of Highway 9.

Several houses were built at the intersection of old Highway 37 and the Pottawatomie/Cleveland county line prior to 1930. Only stone foundations and old maps remain as evidence of these Absentee Shawnee homes.

===1891 Land Run===
On September 22, 1891, at 12 o&#x27;clock noon, by proclamation of President Benjamin Harrison, the second Oklahoma land run began, opening 6,097 homesteads of 160 acres each in what would become Lincoln and Pottawatomie counties. The Citizen Potawatomi and Absentee Shawnee were paid by the US Government sixty-nine cents for each acre that would become the town of Pink. The claimant for each homestead was required to pay $1.50 per acre upon filing a claim in Guthrie or Oklahoma City, and required to reside on the land for at least five years.

During the 1889 and 1891 Land Runs, Texans and other Southern Democrats took up land suitable for cotton production north of the Red River. These Southerners carried Democratic &quot;yellow-dog&quot; propensities into the territory as far north as the Oklahoma City-Pink-Tecumseh area.

===Challenges to settlement===
In 1936, John Fortson wrote about the difficulties faced by early settlers of Pottawatomie County:

Settlers in Pottawatomie County were confronted with problems from which the settlers of Oklahoma territory, opened in 1889, were free. Oklahoma territory was devoid of inhabitants at the opening, and particularly of an Indian population possessing livestock. Tribes in Pottawatomie County were already settled on farms, and to the east the Creeks and Seminoles possessed cattle and horses and some revenue from farming and leasing land to the whites.

Oklahoma territory settlers found trains and telegraph lines crossing the country, while the Pottawatomie area was un-traversed by either. Pottawatomie County was nearly always torn with internal dissension and always at cross purpose with territorial authorities.
Top these statements with the fact that this county bordered Indian territory on two sides, and you have the reason why the county became a rendezvous immediately after the opening for many outlaws operating at the time, and produced such law violators as Black Jack Christian and his brother Bob of the High Five Gang, George Waightman (alias Red Buck) of the Doolin-Dalton Gang, and George “Hookie” Miller, who after years of crime became a US Deputy Marshal.

This scarlet chapter is due principally to the “line” saloon towns that sprang up along the territorial boundary, to the outlaws operating in both territories that found these places convenient hangouts, and to the cattle and horse stealing done by these outlaws.
Early day criminal dockets are long lists of trials for horse stealing. Until the Anti-Horse Thief association began functioning effectively at the turn of the century, farmers found it difficult to keep enough livestock to farm.

Two definite trails were used by the outlaws to move their stolen horses out of the county, relates John Hatfield, veteran peace officer. Both entered the county almost due west of Tecumseh [most likely through present-day Pink]. One branched off to the north, passing through the vicinity of old Shawneetown and leaving the county near Keokuk Falls. The other branched south, leaving the county at a point between Maud and old Violet Springs.

&#x27;On these trails,&#x27; Hatfield says, &#x27;stations were established every 25 miles or so. A man would pick up a horse, say, at Violet Springs. He would ride that night to the station located west of Tecumseh, then return to Violet Springs with another horse before his neighbors could become suspicious. The stolen horse would be taken on west by other riders, who in turn would ride back with horses stolen in the west. Thus through this convenient &quot;shipping&quot; method, the thieves were able to market their wares at spots far distant from the scene of the theft.&#x27;

In April 1900, the &quot;Tecumseh Republican&quot; encouraged the formation of an Anti Horse Thief Association to combat the perpetual problem that plagued area farmers. A scheme was proposed whereby each member would pay a levy if another member&#x27;s horse was stolen, thereby reducing the financial impact to the unfortunate member.

===Early inhabitants===
Absentee Shawnee allottees of 1891 in what became the town of Pink included Rufus Coons (S ½ SE ¼ Section 7), Nellie McCoy (SW ¼ Section 7), Se-So-Tay-Se (N ½ Section 7), Owen Gobbler (E ½ SW ¼ Section 9), Tha-Ke-Tep-Pie (Gobbler) (E ½ Section 9), Jacob Tomahawk (S ½ Section 14), Ja-Squa-Way-Se (W ½ Sw ¼ Section 18), Nad-Pe-Tok-Ca (E ½ SW ¼ Section 18), Ne-Ah-Qua (Pecan) (N ½ NW ¼ Section 18), Pa-Na-Ya-Sker-Ca (S ½ NW ¼ Section 18), John Coons (E ½ Section 18).

These original Indian allotments were not always settled upon. One exception was part of the 1891 allotment for Nellie McCoy (Now-Ah-Lo-Pea-SE), identified as Township 9N Range 2E Section 7 Lot 4 and SE¼ SW¼. A stone foundation has been located on the southern edge of this tract corresponding to a dwelling noted by the 1930 USGS Survey, likely occupied by Nellie or her relatives. Upon Nellie’s death the allotment passed to her husband John Pecan and her two sisters and brother in 1928. The USGS Survey depicts several other dwellings on adjacent land in Cleveland County that may also have been inhabited by Absentee Shawnee prior to 1930 and abandoned prior to 1956 when all of these houses were no longer shown on the survey maps due to their abandonment, decay and difficulty of access.

This part of Nellie McCoy&#x27;s allotment was transferred to William A and Norma Jean Mays in 1964, and later sold to William Reeves Laney and Joyce Ann Fredrickson Laney. The Laneys combined Nellie&#x27;s land with adjacent property and built Wicklow in 1980, a modern interpretation of an 1850 antebellum plantation home. Ownership of Wicklow transferred to Stanley and Betty Faulk in December 2005. The Faulks subsequently designated 100 acres of the property as the &quot;Nellie McCoy Nature Reserve&quot; for the protection of Cross Timbers flora and fauna as well as Native American and American pioneer history.

The town of Pink emerged sometime after the land run and before January 24, 1894 when the United States Post Office Department designated the Pink post office to be operated by Joseph Fahnestock. For some reason Fahnestock declined his appointment as postmaster, however the next month Thomas M. McKittrick accepted the postmaster job. McKittrick&#x27;s wife Laura died one year later in February 1895, leaving her husband and seven children. The post office was moved to Michael Sheyers&#x27; place on Section 16, where Laura was buried, and Sheyers was appointed postmaster. McKittrick reportedly planned to move his family to Missouri soon thereafter. The post office was discontinued in January 1897, reestablished in 1901, just to be discontinued permanently in February 1906. The Tecumseh post office now serves the town.

A cemetery was established at the corner of present-day Fishmarket Rd and Willow View Rd. The stones were dozed away to make way for land development, with the graves likely not relocated. A number of early Pink residents have been buried in either the Black Cemetery, earliest burial in 1893, or Brown Cemetery, earliest burial in 1892. As evidenced by the headstones, there was an increasing number of births beginning in 1891, coinciding with the Land Run.

Brown, about three miles east of the original center of Pink, was named for George Brown. George came from Arkansas, established a farm, and became the first postmaster of Brown. Postal business was conducted out of his home, a 16 by 18-foot log cabin. The post office operated until February 14, 1906, when its services and that of the Pink post office were consolidated in Tecumseh. At one time the town had a cotton gin, two stores, a school, doctors and an undertaking parlor. Brown has been absorbed into the town of Pink.

===Early maps===
The 1891 Oklahoma and Indian Territories map portrays Shawneetown (Shawnee) as the only settlement north of Little River in the future Pottawatomie County. Pink appears later on Cram&#x27;s 1898 Oklahoma and Indian Territory Map.] Topographic mapping of Pink and Pottawatomie County began sometime after 1903. Pink School was built sometime prior to its depiction on the 1910 McComb Quadrangle at the northwest corner of Section 28, Brinton Township (now corner of Okay Rd and Willow View Rd).

Unlike some other places in Oklahoma and Indian Territories, there were no railroads established in the county until after the 1891 Land Run. As late as 1906 the focus in mapmaking was still on depicting railroads, by which time several lines had been built in the county. None would ever come closer to Pink than about 10 miles, which guaranteed lesser importance for the town in an age dominated by railroads.

Although there was no railroad, an east–west road sprang up very early in Pink over which cotton was transported from the eastern part of the county to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in Norman until the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad was opened for business in Shawnee in February 1896. This east–west road is depicted on the Oklahoma 1916 Highway Map, the oldest existing such highway map for the state. The road was in reality little more than a dirt trail that became one of the first numbered roads in the state. What began as Highway 37 (1927) became Highway 41 (1932), renumbered to Highway 9 (1938), and finally paved in 1941. Erosion and the difficulty of creek crossings forced abandonment of the original location of the road between 1927 and 1932. The permanent scar of the old highway can still be seen sporadically through wooded land due west of the intersection of Fishmarket Rd and the existing Highway 9.

===Early business===
By 1928 the town center was located just east of what is now Fishmarket Road on Highway 9. In the early years of Pink, Walter Reuben Stapp, a blacksmith by trade, operated a gristmill located on the west side of present-day Fishmarket Rd 1/2 mile south of Highway 9. Osco A. Miller received a homestead patent in 1905 and ran a general store, traveling frequently to Tecumseh and Shawnee looking after personal business matters as well as School District 114 business. The store was later owned by J.R. McLaughlin, then A.C. Stapp and J.M. Stumpp. As late as 1936, the Tecumseh Cotton Oil Company maintained a location on Miller&#x27;s property at the southeast corner of present-day Highway 9 and Fishmarket Rd.

Agriculture played a big role in the establishment of the town. First planted in the Choctaw Nation in 1825, by 1907 nearly 25% of Oklahoma&#x27;s cultivated acreage was planted in cotton. Hundreds of cotton gins processed the lint into five-hundred-pound bales and separated the seed from the fiber. Compressing plants pressed and stored bales, textile plants processed the fiber, and cottonseed oil mills crushed seeds, using the residue oil for food products, the linters to make paper, the hulls to mix with livestock feeds, and the cake and meal to feed animals.

Cottonseed oil production increased dramatically in the early 20th century with the introduction of Wesson cooking oil in 1899 and Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s Crisco in 1911, both utilizing the oil. Cottonseed produced by Pink farmers found its way into the marketplace after being processed at one of the several dozen cottonseed oil mills in Oklahoma.

General farming, cotton, livestock, dairy and poultry were the main types of farming in Pink in 1935.

===Agrarian Socialism===
In 1917 a radical tenant farmers&#x27; organization called the Green Corn Rebellion &quot;Working Class Union (WCU)&quot; claimed membership of 35,000 in the state of Oklahoma. Seventy-five percent of 24-year-old Oklahoma farmers rented the land they worked, and many found their economic prospects hopeless. With no interest in fighting a &quot;rich man&#x27;s war&quot; in Europe, they found themselves at odds with the recently imposed draft.

The WCU was more of a secret society, complete with night riding and physical violence against its opponents. Although it is unknown how many Pink farmers were members of this organization, it is likely that at least some sympathized with the 50 active members centered around neighboring Brown. This local group held meetings in dugouts, abandoned farmhouses, in the woods and other convenient places. A neighbor, D.O. Barton, who later became a Pottawatomie County deputy, reported them to the federal government, the local revolt was quashed, and five men were convicted of conspiracy.

Some young Pink residents may have been members of the Jones Family, a group active in the Socialist movement during World War I. A few of the group&#x27;s youth were thought to be participants in the Green Corn Rebellion. This group met three miles southwest of Pink at the Mardock Mission (also known as Big Jim&#x27;s Mission), built in 1898 by the Maine Branch of the Women&#x27;s National Indian Association. The Mission was originally built to serve as a school, religious building, and agricultural experiment station for Big Jim&#x27;s Absentee Shawnee, however it also attracted a number of white settlers as they migrated into the area. By 1907, the now non-existent town of Mardock had a post office, two stores and a cotton gin.

Sixty-two percent of farms in Pottawatomie County were still inhabited by tenant farmers in 1930, with the state average being 61.5%. The plight of the tenant farmer had changed little in Pink and the state of Oklahoma since the Green Corn Rebellion. An average of sixty-seven acres were operated per man for all agricultural uses in the county in 1930, comparable with surrounding counties.

===Resource depletion===
In a rush to get land into production, many early farmers cut down pecan trees without realizing the value of the nuts. It wasn&#x27;t until about 1920 that the value of a pecan crop was recognized, and by 1935 it was the second largest cash crop in the county, behind alfalfa.

Many soils around Pink are highly erodible when disturbed. Intensive farming of the land diminished growing capacity and increased soil erosion. Like so many places in Oklahoma, agriculture declined by the 1930s. Some prime cropland still exists, primarily near streams and on bottomland. Livestock farming and residential are now the main land uses.

Erosion and soil exhaustion drove a number of residents to the southeastern part of the county in search of better land, more rain, and work in oil production. By 1936 the western half of the county, including Pink, averaged 20 inhabitants per square mile, less than in 1908.

A few oilfieds were developed around Pink in the early 20th century, with production declining as the years passed. The area was reconsidered for petroleum extraction beginning after 2000, with some new wells entered into production. Cannon Operating of Garland, Texas has invested in new wells on Section 18 adjacent to Highway 9 since 2014.

==Geography==
Pink is located at (35.232145, -97.107072). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

===Cross Timbers===
Pink is situated in the Cross Timbers, a belt of low, rolling hills that is covered by a mosaic of pastureland, rangeland, and woodland encompassing the least-disturbed forest in the U.S. Forty minutes from downtown Oklahoma City on State Highway 9 between Tecumseh and Norman, Pink is in Frontier Country, the central region of Oklahoma that was once part of the wild-and-rowdy American frontier. Although Oklahoma’s territorial frontier days have ended, the remarkable spirit of this thriving crossroads region embodies the feisty independence of bygone days. The Cross Timbers is a small and unique ecoregion that stretches from Kansas to Texas. Millions of 200 to 400-year-old trees have survived in areas unsuitable for farming. The Cross Timbers is one of the least disturbed natural places on Earth, with some of the ancient post oak forest appearing just as it did 6000 years ago.

Washington Irving, the famous American author best known for &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;, visited Indian Territory in the autumn of 1832. Irving&#x27;s journey began and ended in Fort Gibson, Oklahoma. On October 31, the expedition descended the Little River valley. The whole valley was flooded, and it was difficult to find a safe spot to cross the river. After finally crossing it south of Norman on the morning of November 1, they swung northeast toward to the Tecumseh area and then proceeded through northwestern Seminole County. The Daughters of the American Revolution erected a monument in 1932 commemorating the hundredth anniversary of Washington Irving’s trip through the area. The monument was moved to its current location at the Washington Irving Memorial Roadside Park in Little Axe about 1969 due to a highway change at the original site. The marker is commemorative only, and does not mark the location of Irving&#x27;s route, which likely passed south of Pink. Nevertheless, his account of the area is highly representative of the topography and conditions typical in the 1830s.

Irving&#x27;s travels were chronicled in &quot;&quot; in which he described the Cross Timbers:

The Cross Timber is about forty miles in breadth, and stretches over a rough country of rolling hills, covered with scattered tracts of post-oak and black-jack; with some intervening valleys, which, at proper seasons, would afford good pasturage. It is very much cut up by deep ravines, which, in the rainy seasons, are the beds of temporary streams, tributary to the main rivers, and these are called &#x27;branches.&#x27; The whole tract may present a pleasant aspect in the fresh time of the year, when the ground is covered with herbage; when the trees are in their green leaf, and the glens are enlivened by running streams. Unfortunately, we entered it too late in the season The herbage was parched; the foliage of the scrubby forests was withered; the whole woodland prospect, as far as the eye could reach, had a brown and arid hue. The fires made on the prairies by the Indian hunters, had frequently penetrated these forests, sweeping in light transient flames along the dry grass, scorching and calcining the lower twigs and branches of the trees, and leaving them black and hard, so as to tear the flesh of man and horse that had to scramble through them. I shall not easily forget the mortal toil, and the vexations of flesh and spirit, that we underwent occasionally, in our wanderings through the Cross Timber. It was like struggling through forests of cast iron.

The hills, cuestas, and ridges of Pink and the surrounding Northern Cross Timbers are naturally covered by a mosaic of oak, savanna, scrubby oak forest, eastern redcedar, and tall grass prairie. Native on porous, coarse-textured soils derived from sandstone are post oak, blackjack oak, and understory grasses. Tallgrass prairie naturally occurs on fine-textured soils derived from limestone or shale. Fire suppression has increased forest density and allows eastern red cedar to invade the landscape.

===Climate===
Pink has a humid subtropical climate, with frequent variations in weather daily and seasonally, except during the consistently hot and sometimes humid summer months. The area is subject to prolonged and severe droughts, sometimes resulting in wildfires. Conversely, occasional very heavy rainfall occurs with flash flood potential. Consistent winds, usually from the south or southwest during the summer, help temper the hotter weather. Consistent northerly winds during the winter can intensify cold periods. Severe ice storms and snowstorms happen sporadically during the winter.
The average temperature is about 61 °F (16.1 °C). Temperatures range from an average daytime high of 94 °F (34.4 °C) in August to an average low of 26 °F (-3.3 °C) in January. The growing season averages approximately 212 days.

Pink receives about 39 inches (99 cm) of precipitation annually with an average of one inch (2.54 cm) of snow. One in five years receive 10 or more inches (25.4 cm) of snow. Thunderstorms occur on about 49 days each year, predominantly in the spring and summer.
Pink has a very active severe weather season from March through June, especially during April and May. Located in the Texas/Oklahoma/Kansas core of Tornado Alley, the area is prone to especially frequent and severe tornadoes as well as very severe hailstorms and occasional derechoes.

The Cross Timbers have substantial paleoclimatic value. The post oak trees in this area have recorded regional and large-scale weather and climatic extremes spanning the past 350 years, some with profound ecological and human consequences. A network of precipitation-sensitive post oak chronologies has been developed from living trees and historic building timbers. These proxies provide an accurate history of past moisture anomalies, including &quot;the monsoon&quot; of 1813-1850, followed by a prolonged drought and environmental crisis in the 1850s which was worse than the 1930s Dust Bowl.

An F1 tornado damaged the Pink Baptist Church during the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak on May 3. Three tornadoes touched down on May 10, 2010 – an EF2, and EF3 and an EF4. Homes were destroyed, wide swaths of trees were flattened and hail damage was widespread.

==Government==
Oklahoma City expanded into Pottawatomie County in 1962 during an aggressive expansion that covered portions of five counties. The annexation frenzy lasted for 34 years beginning in 1955. Norman expanded eastward to within a few miles of Pink to protect itself from Oklahoma City annexation, further threatening the autonomy and rural status of Pink. In response, Pink was incorporated in the late 1960s, effectively blocking further expansion of Oklahoma City and Norman into western Pottawatomie County.

In 1977 a town hall and fire station were built south of Highway 9 at Okay Rd and Sandy Rock Rd. A Senior Citizens Center was added in later years. A minimum lot size of two and a half acres, with most being more than 10 acres, maintains a rural lifestyle. A number of larger tracts of 80 or more acres still remain.

The Town of Pink is governed by a mayor and representatives from each of five wards. The town has grown periodically through small annexations.

==Education==
Most of Pink is within the Tecumseh Public Schools school district, providing K-12 education through an early learning center, two elementary schools, a middle school and a high school. An area in the north is served by Bethel Public Schools, with two elementary, one middle school and one high school. Portions of southern Pink are in Macomb Public Schools and western portions are in Little Axe Public Schools.

The University of Oklahoma in Norman, and Oklahoma Baptist University in Shawnee are each within a 20-minute drive.

==Culture==
On June 12, 1949, Brendle Baptist Mission&#x27;s twenty-three members met and formed Pink Baptist Church on Highway 9. Brother Clovis Hibbard was the church&#x27;s first pastor, and work on the first building began in August 1949. The sanctuary, nursery, gymnasium and several classrooms were damaged in the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak. Church services were held in the gym until the new sanctuary was dedicated on June 23, 2002.

Pink Holiness Church is located about one mile east of Pink Baptist Church.

Camp Sooner, owned and operated by the Independent Christian Churches of Oklahoma and Texas, offers a retreat center, dining hall, cabins, swimming pool and activities in a Christian setting.

==Health==
Health care is available in Tecumseh, Shawnee and Norman. The nearby Little Axe Health Center operated by the Absentee Shawnee Tribal Health System currently serves only Native Americans, Soonercare members and insured AST employees.

==Transportation==
There is no public transportation. Residents must rely on automobiles due to the rural location. Passenger rail service is available on the Heartland Flyer from Oklahoma City to Fort Worth, Texas at the Norman Amtrak station. Efforts are underway to expand service north to Newton, Kansas to connect with the Southwest Chief with direct lines to Los Angeles and Chicago. The nearest commercial airport is Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City.

A widening of Highway 9 to four lanes through Pink is scheduled to begin with right-of-way purchases and utility relocation in 2020, with completion of the project in 2025.

<text>Shawnee () is a city in and the county seat of Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 29,857 in 2010, a 4.9 percent increase from the figure of 28,692 in 2000. The city is part of the Oklahoma City-Shawnee Combined Statistical Area and the principal city of the Shawnee Micropolitan Statistical Area.

With access to Interstate 40, Shawnee is approximately 45 minutes east of downtown Oklahoma City. To the east and northeast, Shawnee is 112 miles from the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, which provides shipping barge access to the Gulf of Mexico.

==History==
The area surrounding Shawnee was settled after the American Civil War by a number of tribes that the federal government had removed to Indian Territory. The Sac and Fox originally were deeded land in the immediate area but were soon followed by the Kickapoo, Shawnee, and Potawatomi Indians. These federally recognized tribes continue to reside today in and around Shawnee.

Over the course of the 1870s, Texas cattle drovers pushed their herds across Indian Territory; there were four major trails, with the West Shawnee trail crossing near present-day Kickapoo and Main streets. With the cattle drives, railroads were constructed through the territory, with the government forcing tribes to cede rights of way.

In addition, white settlers pressed for more land; they were encroaching on territories previously reserved by treaty to Native Americans. In 1871 a Quaker mission was established here. (The current Mission Hill Hospital is located near that site, now occupied by an historic building.) That first missionary, Joseph Newsom, opened a school in 1872. By 1876 a post office and trading post had been established a quarter mile west of the mission at what became known as Shawnee Town.

Beginning in April 1889, the United States government succumbed to the pressure that had built to open the tribal lands to white settlement. It was also making policy to encourage Native Americans to assimilate into white society. By allocating communal lands to individual households and extinguishing tribal land claims, Congress was preparing the territory for eventual statehood. The end of communal holdings was also intended to be the end of traditional tribal government, to be replaced with leaders appointed by the federal government.

The Dawes Act allocated the tribes&#x27; communal lands into 160-acre plots to individual tribal members believing it would support a family farm. Tribal members were registered with records known as the Dawes Rolls established for each tribe. The government declared that tribal land in excess of what was allocated to member households was &quot;surplus&quot; and available for settlement by non-Native Americans. It allocated that surplus land through land runs, essentially races by which people staked claims on land. Some tribes lost parts of their communal lands, disrupting traditional governments and practices.

The first land run took place in the central area of Oklahoma Territory in 1889 known as the Unassigned Land. In the Land Run of 1891 onto surplus land of the Sac and Fox, Citizen Pottawatomie and Shawnee, just east of the original run, was opened for settlement. Prospective land owners lined up along the Kickapoo Tribe&#x27;s border and Etta B. Ray was the first to dash across the line into the area designated County B.
Her claim and those of John Beard, James T. Farrall, and Elijah A. Alley were to become the city of Shawnee. Etta Ray married Henry Beard, an Oklahoma City business owner, a month after the run and they came to her claim to live in the cabin that she and her family had built for them.
Several names were proposed for the new city, including Brockway, Forest City and Shawneetown, after the store that was south of the townsite. Following a long discussion among early settlers who had their own ideas for the town&#x27;s name, a compromise was reached. They named the town Shawnee after the tribe that had been living there. A second run, onto the Kickapoo Land to the west of the original, was held in 1895, adding more acreage added to Pottawatomie County.

In the early spring of 1895, Mr. Beard entered into an agreement with the promoters of the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad (CO&amp;G), then extending its line from Memphis, Tennessee, to Amarillo, Texas, to build through the land his wife had claimed. In consideration he gave the railway company one-half of the claim of one hundred and sixty acres. The road was built through his farm, and the City of Shawnee was founded on July 4, 1895.

For the first few years of the new century, Shawnee was undergoing a boom that came close to keeping pace with that of Oklahoma City. Located in the heart of cotton, potato, and peach country, Shawnee quickly became an agricultural center. By 1902, there were seven cotton gins in the immediate area and two cotton compresses. Between March 1901 and March 1902, 375 railroad cars of cotton product were shipped out of Shawnee, along with 150,000 bales of cotton. Feed stores, wagon yards, an overall factory, and an assortment of other businesses designed to serve the farmers as they brought their crops to market arose in Shawnee.

The population grew from 250 to 2,500 from 1892 to 1896. In 1896, the Tecumseh Railway was built from Shawnee to Tecumseh, being then the county seat; and, under later CO&amp;G ownership, the line was extended to Asher in 1902. In 1903-1904 the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway extended service to town, after being given land inducements from Henry Beard and James Farrall. Shawnee was an intended destination from Webbers Falls, Oklahoma, of the Webbers Falls, Shawnee and Western Railroad from 1911, but that line never got further west than Warner, Oklahoma.

Shawnee got electric streetcars when the Shawnee Traction Company started running a streetcar service in mid-1904. That company was in the hands of a receiver by December of 1905, and on February 16, 1906 was taken over by the Shawnee-Tecumseh Traction Co. (“STT”), sometimes called the Interurban Electric Railway, which had been incorporated the day before. STT added a 6-mile interurban line to Tecumseh, Oklahoma starting service September 1, 1906, thus giving it about 12.5 miles of total trackage. By 1910 STT had 19.21 miles of total trackage, and by 1917 it had extended its North Broadway streetcar line all the way to the campus of Oklahoma Baptist University. STT abandoned its streetcar and interurban operations in January of 1927. While it continued to operate busses, that service too was suspended in 1931.

Oklahoma Baptist University opened in 1910. Its first building, Shawnee Hall, was a gift from the citizens. St. Gregory&#x27;s College (later St. Gregory&#x27;s University) relocated to Shawnee from Sacred Heart in 1915, where it had been associated with a Catholic mission and school.

On the evening of May 19, 2013, a violent EF4 tornado hit the town resulting in two deaths.

The town was struck by two high-end EF2 tornadoes in the first four months of 2023. The first one occurred on the north side of the city on February 26, although the most severe damage occurred in nearby town of Aydelotte. Both communities would be struck again on April 19 with Shawnee being struck directly. Major damage was inflicted to numerous structures, including the high school, and at the Oklahoma Baptist University campus.

===Historic Downtown===
Downtown Shawnee is an excellent example of many Main Street communities that emerged in the late 19th century as part of the westward movement. Choosing not to organize its activity around a central square, as did many towns in New England, the South, and upper-Midwest, Shawnee represents a distinctly western model of urban development. Depending on railroad lines for its economic health, Shawnee&#x27;s Main Street became the focal point for commercial, manufacturing, and entertainment activity beginning in 1895, four years after the region was opened for European-American settlement when authorities staged a land run.

Competing with Oklahoma City as the hub of central Oklahoma, Shawnee developed a broad base of economic activity. As late as 1910, city leaders hoped that one more rail line, a meat packing plant, and the state capital might be just enough to surge ahead of its rival 30 miles to the west. However, Shawnee came in third in the statewide election to determine the capital. It lost both the railway and the meatpacking plant to Oklahoma City. The setbacks resulted in Shawnee being a small city built with services and retail developed around the activity of Main Street.

The railroad industry led the early strength of the economy. The Santa Fe Train Depot (still extant), with its unique architecture, serves as a visible reminder of the city&#x27;s dependence on the train. During the early 20th century, the Rock Island Railroad and the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad both had depots in the city. Shawnee&#x27;s major employer was the Rock Island Railroad, which had located its main southwestern repair shops in the city in 1896. After nearly 40 years, the railroad moved its shops to El Reno in 1937, but two major buildings remain. The Santa Fe Railroad also had repair shops just south of the city. By 2000 only a large concrete tower remained, and it was demolished that year. Some of the roundhouse buildings are now used by the city for storage and technical repair.

Serving as the region&#x27;s agricultural hub during much of the first quarter of the 20th century, Shawnee provided the market for farmers to sell their crops. Cotton was a major crop and Main Street was often lined with bales; mule sellers, peanut vendors, and peach growers. The building reputed to be the largest cottonseed oil mill in the Southwest is still extant; this same building later was adapted as a peanut factory to process another commodity crop. The Shawnee Flouring Mill, long integral to the city, still dominates the skyline of downtown.

The buildup of industry and the armed forces for the Second World War, and in particular the construction of Tinker Air Force Base east of Oklahoma City, benefited Shawnee&#x27;s economy. At various times, Tinker has employed as many as 3,000 Shawnee residents. After the war, three major manufacturing concerns were important to Shawnee&#x27;s economy. Jonco, Inc., manufactured aviation products and employed nearly 1,000 in 1958. The Sylvania Corporation produced vacuum tubes and electrical parts in its Shawnee plant and employed another 1,000. The Shawnee Milling Company, which had rebuilt after fires in 1934 and 1954, employs nearly 300 workers.

Also continuing as a nationally known company which began in 1909 is Round House Overalls. Recognized as the oldest operating manufacturing company in the state turns out more than 300,000 denim products shipped all over the world. Alvin S. Nucholls established the factory to meet the needs of the overwhelming population working for the railroads in the early days of Shawnee. The Antosh family has owned the company since 1964.

Sonic, a well-known drive-in fast food chain, originated in Shawnee. The 3000th Sonic Drive-In is also in Shawnee. Troy N. Smith, Sr. and Joe McKimmey owned the Log House Restaurant and a drive-up root beer stand called the Top Hat. In 1959 Smith and McKimmey went their separate ways and Smith opened a hamburger drive-in down Harrison Street installing a &quot;call-in&quot; system rather than the carhops. He dubbed his drive-in the Sonic. Both places were in existence until a fire in the Top Hat in the mid-1960s forced closure. McKimmey built the Log House Restaurant into a popular steak house and Smith sold franchises to the Sonic and has since expanded into a national drive-in food chain with now over 3,500 establishments.

Beginning in the 1970s, Shawnee&#x27;s economy improved with the addition of a number of industrial plants, including Eaton Corp. and TDK north of the city; they added approximately 1,000 jobs to the community base.

In 1980 Main Street was dominated by small retail establishments in which 80 percent are housed in buildings built prior to statehood in 1907. The majority of these buildings have had their façades altered to adjust to the changing tastes in the 20th century although one block (between Philadelphia and Union streets) remains substantially unaltered reminding of how life on Main Street functioned prior to statehood.

One block west at Broadway and Main the building originally constructed as The Mammoth Department Store, has been altered very little. The building once housed Montgomery Ward and is now Neal&#x27;s Home Furnishings. Before World War II, Main Street also had numerous drugstores and soda fountains serving as gathering places for young people. Today, Owl Drug, in a building operated as a drugstore since 1895, retains many old fixtures and appears much as it did during the 20th century.

Shawnee&#x27;s first sky scraper, the Hilton Phillips Hotel, later known as the Aldridge, was built in 1928 at the peak of the wealth and growth generated by the oil boom of the 1920s. This stimulated development of the four-story Masonic Temple Office Building, constructed in 1929 across the 9th street from the Aldridge.

Main Street had a number of entertainment facilities. A convention hall attracted well-known celebrities of the 1910s and 1920s, such as Sarah Bernhardt but was razed by 1930 for a bus company barn. An opera house on Market and Main was the site of many memorable events. The early movies theaters are now gone except the Ritz Theater, which was the oldest continuously operating theater in Oklahoma until the theater&#x27;s closure in 1989. It continues to be used for &quot;live shows.&quot; The Bison Theater building remains but after being used as an antique shop it&#x27;s now empty.
Downtown Shawnee has lost many buildings of historical value, but still retains a significant number of resources. These provide a living reminder of the retail and human scale of Main Street in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

===Santa Fe Depot===
Located at 614 E. Main in Shawnee is a unique railroad depot made of limestone blocks two to three-feet deep. With a 60 ft. turret, it takes on the slight appearance of a castle, contrasting with the surrounding architecture. It was built in 1902 and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. After operations of the Santa Fe Railroad ceased in 1971 the City of Shawnee took over the depot property. It was assigned to the Pottawatomie County Historical Society which began restoration of this depot in 1979, after it had stood vacant for two decades. The building was remodeled into a railroad and historical museum, which opened on May 30, 1982. It contains numerous local artifacts from the settlement of Shawnee, as well as railroad memorabilia and a gift shop. The Board of Directors is currently erecting a new building directly north of the old depot. The 100+ year old depot will then house railroad artifacts while other items will be displayed in the new area.

===Benson Park===
Located midway between Shawnee and Tecumseh, Benson Park served the recreational needs of Shawnee residents for about 20 years. It had a stop on the interurban streetcar that ran between the two towns to the park. Built by the railroad to encourage citizens to travel by rail it opened in 1907. The park had a lake for boating, an opera house, skating rink, roller coaster, large picnic areas and later a swimming pool known as The Plunge. The arrival of automobiles which most families could then afford plus the financial distress in the late &#x27;20s forced closure soon after 1930 although the pool and the picnic areas were still briefly in use. , the space that was once the park is on private property and occupied by a large pecan orchard.

===Pottawatomie County Seat dispute===
In 1907 Oklahoma was admitted as a state and 8,024 people voted that the county seat be moved to Shawnee while 5,027 wanted it to remain in Tecumseh. The case was appealed and the higher courts decided bribery might have figured into the election since Shawnee had offered use of property in Woodland Park as a site for the county court house. In 1911, the people of Pottawatomie County again voted to keep the county seat at Tecumseh, by a vote of 7,749 to 5,927.

In October 1930 some 6,700 signatures were collected on a petition to ask Governor William J. Holloway for a referendum on the site of the county seat. A special election was held December 18, and 12,800 voters, a record number, went to the polls. Shawnee won the necessary two-thirds majority by a 90-vote margin. A recount cut this to 11. Tecumseh filed suit, alleging election fraud relating to a $35,000 slush fund, Shawnee supporters providing liquor at the polls, college boys being allowed to vote, etc. The Supreme Court favored Shawnee.

Until the mid-1930s, county officers contracted business in downtown Shawnee buildings. President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal helped fund construction of a new county courthouse in Shawnee which was built in Woodland Park. On July 6, 1935, Governor E.W. Marland dedicated the new building.

==Education==
===Colleges and universities===
*Oklahoma Baptist University (OBU) was founded in 1910. The city was chosen by the founders of OBU in part because two Baptist Conventions—one in Indian Territory and one in Oklahoma Territory—had merged in the period of Oklahoma being admitted as a state to the Union. The city of Shawnee was considered neutral territory, since Shawnee had been neither in Indian Territory nor Oklahoma Territory, but instead was within the boundaries of the Potawatomi Nation. 
*The former St. Gregory&#x27;s University, a Benedictine Catholic institution founded in 1875, was located in Shawnee; however, St. Gregory&#x27;s University suspended operations at the end of 2017, citing financial difficulties. In December 2018, the sale of its Shawnee campus to Hobby Lobby was approved by the bankruptcy court. The campus was then leased to OBU. In May 2019, OBU renamed the tract as the OBU Green Campus, both in honor of the Green family, owners of Hobby Lobby, and because the color green is one of OBU’s official university colors. In December 2019, Hobby Lobby and the Green family donated the campus to OBU.

===Airport===
The Shawnee Regional Airport has a asphalt lighted runway with self-services available seven days a week.
Shawnee has had an airport, private pilot training and air service since the 1920s. May 7, 1919, the city commission discussed constructing an air field, with several locations offered but settled on the old city farm where the fire horses were kept. Business and civic leaders cooperated with aviation companies in the construction of a modern airport. Graham Flying service operated the facility in the beginning then sold it to Curtiss Flying Service. An Aviation Committee of the Chamber of Commerce brought in several air shows including parachute jumps. In 1930 L.E. Regan purchased the Shawnee Municipal Airport and provided flying lessons, passenger trips and an aviation club. Shawnee was one of the hot spots in the state for aviation and was host to a visit from Amelia Earhart in 1931. The city was part of the Oklahoma Short Line Airways Company with air passenger service in and out daily. With the coming of World War II, civilian fliers were automatically grounded in December 1941 until they took an oath of allegiance, were fingerprinted and presented a birth certificate. City officials went to Washington to offer Shawnee as a site for one of the many military training bases which would be needed as the country headed into the war. Meanwhile, the citizens of Shawnee overwhelmingly passed a bond issue for $200,000 to match the $285,000 allocated by the federal government to build a local base. The Shawnee Municipal Airport was moved to a site north of town. April 1943 the erection of the Shawnee Navy base was begun and by August the first sailors began arriving. First plans for the base was to be an auxiliary extension for the base at Norman but later was named as Shawnee Naval Air Station, a school for navigators. Then abruptly in March 1945 all Navy personnel and equipment were moved to the Clinton OK base because of the limited land available to expand. Shawnee&#x27;s NAS was put in caretaker status and the equipment was sold off as surplus, much of it going to the City of Shawnee and its citizens. The Shawnee Municipal Airport was returned to its original site in 1946 where it remains today.

Terminal
On August 29, 2011, the City of Shawnee opened a new terminal building replacing the terminal built in the 1950s. The modern, two-story design, is approximately 4,000 square feet. Governor of Oklahoma Mary Fallin was the featured speaker during the official opening praising Shawnee officials for their determination in getting the project started, funded and completed led by former Shawnee Mayor Chuck Mills. Oklahoma Aeronautics Commission Director Victor Bird also addressed the crowd saying &quot;It&#x27;s a far cry from what was here just one year ago.&quot;

The new terminal includes offices, lounges, a large conference room space upstairs that doubles as an observation deck. A $325,000 grant from the U.S. Economic Development Authority paid for a large sum of the more than $965,000 it took to build the new terminal building.
The Aeronautics Commission also provided a $275,000 state grant to help in the construction costs, while the City of Shawnee paid for the remaining amount. From 2008 to 2011, the Shawnee Regional Airport received nearly $8 million in state and federal grants for various runway and taxiway improvements.

Sister City – Nikaho, Japan
At the southeastern edge of the airport is a commemorative Japanese International Peace Garden
A &quot;Bridge of Understanding&quot; and a gravel area with several Oriental-style stone ornamentation. A plaque at the bridge states: &quot;Shawnee Nikaho/Bridge of Understanding/is dedicated to the memory of Mayor Pierre Taron/a strong proponent of Sister Cities. &quot;There is a gazebo approximately 15 ft. by 18 ft. with a gravel and stone floor. In the center is a wood picnic table with benches for seating on each side. The roof is wood shingled and colorful flowers are planted around the outside of the gazebo which is dedicated to the Sister Cities International program between Shawnee and Nikaho, Japan. In 1987, a Japanese manufacturing company, TDK, opened a factory in Shawnee which locally manufactures ferrite magnets for electronic motors. The mayor of Shawnee at that time, Pierre F. Taron, Jr., sought to establish a Sister City relationship between Shawnee, Oklahoma, U.S.A. and Nikaho, Japan. Each year, citizens of each town visit the other town, to renew ties, exchange gifts, and spend time learning about the other&#x27;s culture. The delegations stay with local host families.

===Museums and Theatre===
The Pottawatomie County Historical Society maintains a museum of the railroad history in the county as well as displaying other artifacts of the area in the former Santa Fe Depot, downtown at 614 E Main.

The Citizen Potawatomi Nation operates a &quot;Cultural Heritage Center&quot; which houses tribal rolls, archives, and gift shop. The institution also interprets and presents exhibits of Potawatomi culture. Located between Shawnee and Tecumseh.

Shawnee Little Theater and OBU have organized seasons of theater programs in Shawnee.

===Parks and recreation===
The City of Shawnee maintains &quot;Shawnee Twin Lakes&quot;, which are located to the west of the city.

Shawnee has numerous small parks within the city.

Larch–Miller Park is located in the 900 block of North Broadway. The park was dedicated to Aloysius Larch-Miller who fought for women&#x27;s suffrage and was head of the ratification committee fighting for a special session to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment. Although sick with influenza, and against advice, Larch-Miller debated Oklahoma Attorney General Sargent Prentiss Freeling. She won a majority of support but the strain took its toll and she died on February 2, 1920. A monument was erected in the park to honor her by Carrie Chapman Catt.

Woodland Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Park is two blocks north of Main street. First built in 1905, the park originally featured fountains and sunken gardens and was the site of frequent Chautauqua meetings led by such people as William Jennings Bryan. In 1905, the Carnegie library was built on the southwest corner of the park (currently the District Attorney&#x27;s office of Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma). There is also a Veteran&#x27;s memorial in the southeast corner as well that features a helicopter once used during the Korean War. The park also features the Splash Pad that opened in 2015 replacing the large Municipal swimming pool which had been built by the PWA in 1936. The stone-constructed locker room remains from the pool. The park also features two tennis courts located on the east side of the park and has a playground area and a stage with metal bleachers used for special events throughout the year. There are numerous stone and concrete picnic tables, some over eighty years old. A small sculpture of a bald eagle atop a sphere on the north edge and a miniature version of the Statue of Liberty face Highland street.

Briscoe Boy Scout Park named in honor of Dick Briscoe, a long-time Boy Scout leader in Shawnee, – located at East Main and Pesotum streets. It features a splash pad, two basketball courts, two tennis courts, a playground for children, picnic tables with BBQ grills and a walking track around the park.

Red Bud Park – located at the intersection of Beard and Dill and to the west of Larch-Miller park. This park was constructed after the devastating flood of Shawnee Creek that ran through the area in 1928. The picturesque park features a large drainage ditch lined with local stone, many large trees, playground equipment and a wrought-iron entrance sign.

Shawnee is home to three wellness facilities.
* Troy &amp; Dollie Smith Family YMCA
* Recreation and Wellness Center, on the Campus of Oklahoma Baptist University
* Firelake Fitness Center, operated by the Citizen Potawatomi Nation

===Sports===

Shawnee has a rich sports history that reaches back before statehood. The first report of a town baseball team was in 1902. There has since been organized baseball, from sandlot to minor league teams. In the early days of Shawnee, businesses such as the Rock Island shops and civic organizations promoted teams in the Twilight League. In 1929 and &#x27;30 Shawnee was home to the Robins, a St. Louis Cardinal minor league team and part of the Western Association. Several Robins went on to play MLB, including Bob Klinger (Pirates), Ival Goodman (Reds, Cubs), Alfred &quot;Lefty&quot; Smith (Giants, Phillies, Indians), Ray Starr (Cardinals, Giants, Braves, Reds, Pirates, Cubs) and Fritz Ostermueller (Red Sox, Browns, Dodgers, Pirates), who was depicted in the Jackie Robinson film &quot;42.&quot;

The Brooklyn Dodgers provided Shawnee with a Class D minor league in the Sooner State League from 1950 to 1957. The Hawks competed against McAlester, Ardmore, Pauls Valley, Lawton, Seminole and Sherman and Paris, Texas. The most well-known major leaguers to get their start with the Hawks were Don Demeter, a Dodger pitcher from Oklahoma City and Stan Williams (Dodgers, Yankees, Indians and Twins).

Shawnee also hosted two spring training games between major league teams at Athletic Field (now called Memorial Park). In 1937 the New York Giants and Cleveland Indians played and brought in the Giants leading pitchers, Carl Hubbell, who was from the nearby community of Meeker. The following year the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Chicago White Sox also played a game in Shawnee. Cy Blanton, who lived in Shawnee and had played for the Robins, and Paul and Loyd Waner from nearby McLoud, were members of the Giants&#x27; squad.

At least 34 Major League Baseball players have connections to Shawnee, either by birth, or having played on a local team or lived in town at one time. Eighteen with ties to Shawnee have played professional football and ten local athletes have participated in pro basketball.

Shawnee High School has also had a colorful sports history. Records from as early as 1906 are found for football and baseball. Over the years the football team has won the state title three times, the most recent was in 2003. Several SHS grads have gone on to play NFL football over the years, most notedly Darrien Gordon, a 1989 grad, who played in three Super Bowls, one with the San Diego Chargers and two with the Denver Broncos. Notably, since the year 2000, SHS has won seven state championships, two in baseball, one in girls&#x27; basketball, two in boys&#x27; cross country, one in boys&#x27; track and one in girls&#x27; track. The high school provides excellent facilities with Jim Thorpe Stadium, Memorial Park, softball field and the Shawnee Performing Arts Center combo which includes a state-of-the art gym.

Shawnee offers youth sports of all variety either through the YMCA or the Shawnee Sports Association. There are also three golf courses, several tennis courts, two bowling alleys, Lion&#x27;s Club baseball park and a softball complex at Firelake. Shawnee briefly hosted the Shawnee Warriors, a semi-pro football team that competed in the Oklahoma Metro Football League competing as the Millers, affiliated with the Oklahoma City Yard Dawgz, a minor league pro arena team that season.

<text>Tecumseh () is a city in Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma. The population was 6,302 by the 2020 United States census. It was named for the noted Shawnee chief, Tecumseh. The locale was designated as the county seat at Oklahoma&#x27;s statehood, but a county-wide election moved the seat to Shawnee in 1930.

==History==

A site was opened for settlement September 23, 1891, as a result of the land run into reservations of the Sac and Fox, Kiowa, Kickapoo, Shawnee, and Pottawatomi peoples. The townsite, named Tecumseh by a U.S. Army major, had been designated as the seat of County &quot;B&quot; in the newly formed Oklahoma Territory by the Department of the Interior on July 17, 1891. A post office was established in the town on September 18, 1891.

Railroads first arrived in 1896, when the Tecumseh Railway built a line in from Shawnee. This trackage, acquired by the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad, was extended to Asher in 1902, and was later owned by the Rock Island. In 1903, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway began serving Tecumseh&#x27;s surrounding agricultural region, in which cotton was the main crop. Tecumseh was linked to Shawnee, Oklahoma by the Shawnee-Tecumseh Traction Co. in 1906, but ending in 1927.

Cotton production dropped in the 1920s because of depressed prices and a boll weevil infestation. The population declined for a time after 1930, because many townspeople moved away to earn a living elsewhere.

In 2002, the Supreme Court of the United States evaluated whether requiring students from Tecumseh schools to take drug tests to participate in extracurricular activities was constitutional. In a 5–4 decision, the court ruled that the tests were allowable in &quot;Board of Education v. Earls&quot;.

<text>Albion is a town in northeast Pushmataha County, Oklahoma, United States, approximately south of the Pushmataha-Latimer county line. The population was 58 as of the 2020 Census. When Albion was established, before Oklahoma became a state, the community was located in Wade County, Choctaw Nation, in what was then known as Indian Territory.

== History ==
A United States Post Office opened at this location on December 6, 1887. Charles F. Igo was the first postmaster.

In its early days, Albion was a sawmill town in the Indian Territory. Later, it became a trading center in an agricultural region in which cotton and other crops were grown.

During 1885–6, the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway, more popularly known as the &quot;Frisco&quot;, built a line from north to south through the Choctaw Nation, connecting Fort Smith, Arkansas, with Paris, Texas. The site of Albion was selected because of its proximity to the Kiamichi River, with its abundant water supply. Adjacent station stops were established at Talihina to the north and Kiamichi to the south.

The railroad paralleled the Kiamichi River throughout much of its route in present-day Pushmataha County. Train stations were established every few miles to aid in opening up the land and, more particularly, to serve as the locations of section houses. Supervisors for their respective miles of track lived in the section houses to administer the track and its right-of-way. These stations also served as points at which the trains could draw water.

Few roads or trails existed. Transportation was provided by the Frisco Railroad, which offered six trains per day — three in each direction — until it closed to passenger traffic during the late 1950s. The railroad continued freight operations until 1981, when it closed altogether and its rails were removed. The loss of passenger rail fortunately coincided with the construction of U.S. Highway 271.

At the time of its founding, Albion was located in Wade County, Choctaw Nation.

Albion has more in common economically with Talihina, the town to its north. Planners of the proposed State of Sequoyah, who in 1905 proposed a state to be formed from the Indian Territory, realized this, and called for Albion to be the southernmost town in a county, Wade County, which was also to include Talihina and towns to its north, and stretch far to the north and west. Instead, Sequoyah was not admitted to the Union by Congress, and in the state of Oklahoma which followed it, Albion became the northeasternmost town of a county whose geographic and population centers are far to Albion&#x27;s southwest.

Albion prospered during its first few decades. Most business was centered on a town square, with residential neighborhoods ringing the square. During recent decades, however, it has diminished greatly. United States Census returns show it dropping from a high of 300 residents in 1920 to just 88 in 1990. More information on Albion may be found in the Pushmataha County Historical Society.

Albion became home to an internationally known poet and author when Mato Kosyk, or Kossick, moved to the town in 1912. Locating there because its climate was considered healthy and its views of the Kiamichi Mountains were scenic, Kosyk lived for the next 28 years there, until his death in 1940. Kosyk, a Lutheran minister, migrated to the United States from Werben, Lower Lusatia, Germany in 1883. He is considered one of the most significant writers in Sorbian, a Slavic language, and his 150th birthday was celebrated by his followers in Europe in 2003. Kosyk may not have fared well during his years in Albion; according to accounts he was swindled and defrauded by unscrupulous residents.

In 1979, the Mato Kosyk House in Albion was entered into the NRHP. It is considered significant as the only surviving structure associated with the famous poet.

The post office in Albion was scheduled for possible closure by the US Postal Service in 2012.

<text>Antlers is a city in and the county seat of Pushmataha County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 2,221 as of the 2020 United States census. The town was named for a kind of tree that becomes festooned with antlers shed by deer, and is taken as a sign of the location of a spring frequented by deer.

== History ==
Evidence exists of prehistoric occupation and activity within the city limits of present-day Antlers. Arrowheads are found periodically at sites throughout the town. Most of the prehistoric sites are atop hills, which the inhabitants could use for defensive purposes and found the most healthful.

A Mississippian culture settlement developed at Spiro Mounds, which was active from the mid-9th into the 15th century. This is the westernmost site of the culture and it is &quot;one of the most important archeological discoveries in North America.&quot; The 80-acre site is preserved today as Oklahoma&#x27;s only state archeological park.

The Spiro Mounds leaders controlled the area of Antlers and the rest of the Kiamichi River valley, as well as a large portion of what is now southeastern Oklahoma and adjacent states. The Mississippian culture was based along the Mississippi River and its tributaries. Its largest center was at Cahokia, just to the east of the Mississippi in present-day Illinois. The peoples had an extensive trading network that spanned the continent from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes. Spiro Mounds culture was also part of the Southeast Ceremonial Complex, an important culture which extended into what is now known as the Southeastern United States.

In the era of European exploration and colonization, the historic Caddo Indians, descendants of the Mississippians, had this area as part of their large territory. Rarely establishing permanent settlements, they were highly nomadic. They lived in bands that were allied in three loose regional confederacies. They lived by gathering plants and nuts, hunting and fishing.

Not recognizing that this was already Caddo territory, the United States granted the lands to the Choctaw Indians in 1832 by the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. This was in exchange for the Choctaw ceding their land in the American Southeast to the federal government during the period of Indian Removal. The other Five Civilized Tribes (Muskogee (Creek), Cherokee, Chickasaw and Seminole) were also forced to cede their lands in the same period.

The Choctaw established communities that replicated the three major divisions of their people in the Southeast, so there were three centers of loose government. White settler encroachment on their land soon began again. During the American Civil War, most of the Choctaw allied with the Confederate States of America, which had suggested it would support an independent Indian state if it won the war.

During the 1880s the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway, more popularly known as the &quot;Frisco&quot;, built a north–south line through the Choctaw Nation, connecting Fort Smith, Arkansas with Paris, Texas. The US treaties required the tribes to grant the railroads rights of way. The railroad paralleled the Kiamichi River throughout much of its route in present-day Pushmataha County. The railroads established train stations every few miles to be centers of new development. They also were the sites of section houses; supervisors for their respective miles of track lived in the section houses to administer the track and its right-of-way. These stations also served as points at which the trains could draw water.

The site of Antlers was selected for a station due to a local freshwater spring. Adjacent stations were established at Davenport — now Kellond — to the north, and Hamden to the south. The Choctaw in this sparsely populated area, at that time known as Jack&#x27;s Fork County of the Choctaw Nation in the Indian Territory, farmed or subsisted on the land.

The Choctaw had built few roads or improved trails. The Frisco Railroad was the chief form of transportation through the Territory. It offered six trains per day (three in each direction) until it closed to passenger traffic during the mid 1960s. The loss of passenger rail followed the construction of several highways linking Antlers to other communities, including U.S. Highway 271, Oklahoma State Highway 7, and Oklahoma State Highway 2. The southern section of the Indian Nation Turnpike, which has an interchange at Antlers, opened in 1970. The Frisco Railroad continued freight operations until 1981, when it closed altogether and its rails were removed. This was an era of railroad restructuring and reductions nationwide.

A United States Post Office was established at Antlers, Indian Territory, on August 26, 1887. According to early European-American settler Colonel Victor M. Locke, Jr., the following is an account of how the name was attached to it. A hunter was encamped at the spring at present-day Antlers early one autumn and killed a &quot;magnificent buck.&quot; He nailed its antlers to a tree close to the spring as a challenge to other hunters, who followed suit. Railroad officials later designated the new station stop as &quot;Antlers&quot; in recognition of this prominent local landmark tree bristling with points.

The Choctaw government allowed some European Americans to settle on their land, but provided them no protections or government services of any kind. During the 1890s the U.S. government acted to provide a minimal level of support. It established Recording Districts throughout the lands of all Five Civilized Tribes of the Indian Territory. Antlers became Record Town of Recording District #24, which covered almost all of present-day Pushmataha, Choctaw and McCurtain counties. American citizens living in this area were provided with the rudiments of a justice system, with a US Court operating on a part-time schedule.
To support the needs of a Record Town, a United States Court was established at Antlers. A large wooden courthouse was built to accommodate the justices, lawyers and courtroom facilities necessary. Antlers became home to a small government outpost. During the waning days of the Indian Territory, the Republican Party was in power in Washington, D.C. The federal justices, sheriffs, deputies, and court clerks were all appointed by the Republican Party according to patronage practices of the time. The majority of local Native American residents, who had been removed from former Confederate States, had allied with the Confederacy in the hopes of gaining an Indian state. They continued to be affiliated mostly with the Democratic Party.

In order to prepare for Oklahoma&#x27;s statehood, the United States Government surveyed and plotted every town of significance. Antlers was surveyed in 1901 and a townsite of was mapped. Once the area was included in a state, residents could establish formal ownership of their homes and property.

Under the Dawes Act and the related Curtis Act, the United States required changes among all the Native American nations in Indian Territory to enable admission of Oklahoma as a state. As part of a policy of assimilation, tribal governments were dissolved and tribal control of communal lands was ended, in order to extinguish Native American land titles. Communal lands were allocated to individual households of members of tribes. Any remaining land the government declared &#x27;surplus&#x27; and sold, including to non-Natives. Native Americans lost most of their land in these transactions. The Indian Territory was absorbed into the state of Oklahoma on November 16, 1907. Antlers lost its prized status as a United States federal court town; and many jobs left the town when courts were established elsewhere. Numerous residents left to gain employment in other cities.

Antlers has served as a local resort town, as it is a gateway to the Kiamichi Mountains. Many tourists came to fish, hunt, and relax in the town and nearby mountains. Many came from Paris, Texas. Sustained growth occurred for several decades.

On April 12, 1945, Antlers was devastated by a powerful tornado. Moving southwest to northeast, it destroyed stores and homes in a wide swath, including stores and shops at the south end of High Street. Sixty-seven residents were killed, and more than 300 injured. Antlers High School was adapted as a makeshift morgue to receive bodies. In the 300 block of East Main Street, the large and historic St. Agnes Academy for Choctaw Indians was destroyed. Two nuns were killed but all the students survived. Reporting of the destructive tornado was superseded by coverage of the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, which also occurred that day. But the federal government dispatched U.S. Army troops to Antlers from Camp Maxey, Texas, a World War II-era Army base located between Paris and Arthur City, Texas. The troops assisted with rescue, maintaining law and order, and clearing rubble. Another, similarly serious tornado struck Antlers in April 1954 resulting in 40 fatalities.

Meteorologists have since retroactively categorized the Antlers tornado as an F5, the most powerful on the Fujita Scale. Local residents believed that two tornadoes struck the town, with witnesses claiming to have seen two funnels. The Antlers tornado funnel measured a half-mile wide at its base, and the two funnel clouds observed locally were within the larger one. The Antlers F5 was so powerful that it could be clearly heard, as well as seen, four miles (6 km) east of town at the Ethel Road crossroads, and as far north as Kosoma.

After 1945 the town had growth and improvements similar to those in other parts of the United States. With the advent of universal electrical service, most homes gained air-conditioning, and later almost all households acquired televisions. Social relations changed at this point, as individuals and families found their entertainment indoors, rather than outdoors or downtown.

In 1975 R.C. Pruett opened East Town Village on the eastern outskirts of Antlers. He duplicated the kind of development taking place across the country, with major retailers relocating from historic downtowns to larger facilities on the outskirts. Pruett&#x27;s grocery store was new. But within a few years, merchants began deserting Antlers&#x27; historic downtown for sites at East Town Village or other locations, or closing altogether.

At the same time, Antlers residents began shopping at Wal-Mart, which offered greater variety and lower prices than Antlers&#x27; local merchants were able to offer. In recent years there has been an effort to declare Antlers a &quot;Main Street USA&quot; site, to treat its historic center as a destination, and emphasize its architecture. Due to a series of arson and fires beginning in the 1970s, Antlers lost a number of its stores, changing the character of its downtown. But the remaining buildings are sturdy brick with antique facades. In recent years merchants have been removing the 1960s-era awnings and other structures, adopted in a modernization effort, to return the buildings to their unique historic character.

During recent years the Antlers Frisco Depot and Antlers Spring have been added to the National Register of Historic Places, as they contribute to the architecture and history of the town. The depot was built in 1913, at a time when the state had imposed legal racial segregation. Its separate waiting rooms and toilets for white and black passengers expressed the racial inequality and lack of civil rights for minorities that was incorporated into the design of public buildings. More information on the history of Antlers may be found at the Pushmataha County Historical Society.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The historic center of Antlers—not including its newly expanded city limits—straddles at least two watersheds. Rain falling in the northeast part of town drains into creeks flowing northward directly into the Kiamichi River. This soil is rocky, with bedrock near the surface. Water falling elsewhere in the town drains into creeks draining southward into Beaver Creek, which flows to the Kiamichi River. This soil is sandy. Standpipe Hill—which overlooks downtown Antlers—stands considerably higher, and overlooks the Kiamichi River valley to the north.

<text>Clayton is a town in northern Pushmataha County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 555 as of the 2020 Census.

== History ==

Clayton was formerly known as Dexter. A United States Post Office was established at Dexter, Indian Territory on March 31, 1894, and was named for Dexter Chapman, early-day resident.

Dexter was located in Wade County, Choctaw Nation.
The official name of the post office name changed to Clayton, Indian Territory on April 5, 1907. Its name is thought to have been derived from Clayton, Missouri. It is also possible the town renamed itself after William H.H. Clayton, judge of the U.S. Court for the Central District of Indian Territory. Judge Clayton was prominent in the role to gain Oklahoma’s statehood.

Clayton is the largest town or community in northern Pushmataha County. It is the region&#x27;s largest trading center due to its relative distance from the county seat of Antlers—36 miles.

Flagpole Mountain retains a fire tower. Built of metal and several stories tall, it was once part of a network of towers, all staffed, from which a fire watch was maintained. It is the only tower remaining in Pushmataha County, although it is no longer operational. Views from the tower offer a panorama stretching for many miles in any direction.

Clayton, as regional trading center, remains economically healthy, with a locally based economy. It is currently home to a public school, several churches, and numerous businesses and homes.

During recent years the Clayton High School has become recognized as an architecturally and historically significant building, and has been added to the NRHP. The building was found to be a very unusual example of WPA architecture—one of only two known single-use auditoriums constructed by the WPA.

On February 13, 2015, approximately 5% of the town population was arrested in a methamphetamine drug sweep.

More information on the history of Clayton may be found in the Pushmataha County Historical Society.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and 0.58% is water.

Clayton, located in the Kiamichi River valley, is framed on its west by Flagpole Mountain (1,562 ft.) and to its east by unnamed mountains topping 1,600 feet in elevation. Within a few miles of Clayton is scenic McKinley Rocks, a collection of massive boulders strewn across a mountain top. South of Clayton is Clayton Lake State Park which is surrounded by a pine tree forest. Northwest of town is Sardis Lake, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam which impounds the water of Jack&#x27;s Fork Creek. The Pushmataha Wildlife Refuge is also nearby.

<text>Rattan is a town in Pushmataha County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 276 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Rattan is located in southern Pushmataha County at the intersection of Oklahoma routes 3 and 93. Rock Creek flows past just west of the community center and Hugo Lake lies to the south in adjacent Choctaw County. The southwest end of the Ouachita Mountains lies to the north.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

== History ==

Established in approximately 1910, Rattan was named for Rattan, Texas, from which a number of its early white settlers came.

Rattan, Texas—located in Delta County, twenty-one miles southwest of Paris, Texas—was named for local postal officer Clarence V. Rattan in 1893. Following Oklahoma&#x27;s statehood in 1907 a number of Delta County families relocated to the new Pushmataha County, among them Akins, Akards, and Helms. The Delta County family (or families) apparently establishing itself in Rattan has not been identified.

Originally overshadowed by the nearby white settlement of Belzoni, Oklahoma, Rattan did not become economically successful enough to merit its own United States Post Office until December 12, 1910, with its first postmaster being Moses A. Fleming. Belzoni’s success as a farming hub sapped Rattan of much of its potential vitality, and it was not until the former&#x27;s decline that Rattan emerged as the population center of southeastern area of the county.

Prior to establishment of its post office with the name “Rattan”, the area was called Sulphur Springs, Indian Territory. Sulphur Springs, located 3/4 mile south-southeast of the highway intersection of OK 3 and OK 93 in present-day Rattan, was county seat of Cedar County, Choctaw Nation. It was established by the Choctaws’ Doaksville Constitution of 1860 and, in the manner of most Choctaw county seats, served a part-time role as legal and political center. It was never a sizeable permanent settlement and boasted almost no mercantile or retail stores.

County court met on the first Monday of each month and was called Probate Court, even though it was more similar to modern-day county court proceedings than a modern probate court. The court met in a large log house, constructed of long, straight logs, serving as both an Indian Methodist church and court house. The Cedar County Court House was torn down by white settlers sometime after Oklahoma’s statehood in 1907, after which it ceased serving any legal use. The Court House was located about 200 yards north of the Sulphur Springs and 1/4 mile due west of Rattan Cemetery.

Sulphur Springs took its name from several sulphur springs located in the vicinity. A number of Choctaw families living around the Cedar County Court House used them as well as visitors to court.

The improved Ft. Smith to Ft. Towson military road of 1839 passed along the east side of Rattan (at the water tower and Howard&#x27;s Cafe, 1.02 miles east of the OK 93 junction with OK 3) after crossing the &quot;Seven Devils&quot; on its way southeast to Spencer Academy and Doaksville. This wagon road was heavily used by the U.S. Army from 1839–48, and remained the main road through Cedar County until the Frisco railroad was completed in 1887 from Ft. Smith through Antlers to Paris, Texas. The initial U.S. land survey of the area was conducted in 1896. T4S, R18E shows Rock Creek, the Court House and the military road.

Natural resources were key to Rattan’s early growth. Many of its settlers were farmers. Timber, logged in the Kiamichi Mountains north of the community, also fueled growth. A number of logging trams, or railroad lines, were built into the mountains and large camps of loggers and their dependents lived along the tracks for months on end. These mobile, rolling communities were sizeable enough to feature small schools, physicians offices, and general stores. Most of their residents lived in railroad cars which traveled along with the work crews as they logged deeper into the mountains.

Rattan became the Great Depression-era recipient of a handsome public school built by the Works Progress Administration. Constructed of native stone brought from nearby fields, it continues in use today.

During the 1990s Rattan incorporated as a town, and now offers basic public services.

School students from Rattan made news headlines during 2000 as they initiated a series of events with international repercussions. During World War II the Moyers area was the site of two lethal air crashes. British pilots operating from a Royal Air Force base in Texas crashed into White Rock Mountain and Big Mountain, killing four crew men. Two planes were destroyed. A third plane crash-landed successfully a few miles northwest at Jumbo.

These events had receded from memory and were generally forgotten until a history class in the Rattan Public School began pursuing information about them. Their research led them to commemorate the events. On February 20, 2000, the AT6 Monument was dedicated in the fliers&#x27; honor at the crash site on Big Mountain. Over 1,000 people attended the ceremony, and the story of it and Rattan&#x27;s intrepid young scholars was carried by the British Broadcasting Corporation and many newspapers around the world.

More information on Rattan, Sulphur Springs, the AT6 Monument, and the Kiamichi River valley may be found in the Pushmataha County Historical Society.
