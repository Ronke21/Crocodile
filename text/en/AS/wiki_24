<text>Jacksonville is a city in Onslow County, North Carolina. As of the 2020 census, the population was 72,723, which makes Jacksonville the 14th-most populous city in North Carolina. Jacksonville is the county seat and most populous community of Onslow County, which is coterminous with the Jacksonville, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area. Demographically, Jacksonville is the youngest city in the United States, with an average age of 22.8 years old, which can be attributed to the large military presence. The low age may also be in part due to the population drastically increasing over the past 80 years, from 783 in the 1930 census to 72,723 in the 2020 census.

It is the home of the United States Marine Corps&#x27; Camp Lejeune and New River Air Station. Jacksonville is located adjacent to North Carolina&#x27;s Crystal Coast area.

==History==
The end of the Tuscarora wars in 1713 and the forced removal of Native American tribes was followed by permanent settlement of the regions between New Bern and Wilmington. The New River became a major production center for naval stores like turpentine. The downtown waterfront park is built on the site original site of Wantland&#x27;s Ferry.

In 1752, a devastating hurricane destroyed the county seat of Johnston, and Wantlands Ferry, located further up the New River, at the present site of Jacksonville, was chosen as the site of the new county courthouse. The area was later known as Onslow Courthouse. In 1842, the town was incorporated and renamed Jacksonville in honor of former U.S. President Andrew Jackson. The town was briefly captured and occupied in November 1862 by a raiding party led by U.S. Navy Lt. William B. Cushing.

Jacksonville and Onslow County continued to rely on naval stores, lumber, and tobacco crops for industry. In 1939, Colonel George W. Gillette of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers surveyed and mapped the area from Fort Monroe, Virginia to Fort Sumter, South Carolina which included the Onslow County coastline and the New River. The map is believed to have fostered the interest of the War and Navy Departments in establishing an amphibious training base in the area. Congressman Graham Arthur Barden of New Bern lobbied Congress to appropriate funds for the purchase of about along the eastern bank of the New River. The establishment in 1941 of Marine Barracks, New River, later renamed Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base, led to the relocation of 700 families. While the landowners were compensated, many of the families displaced were sharecroppers who did not own the land on which their houses were built, and did not receive compensation for their structures. Some African American families were able to purchase property from Raymond Kellum and established the community of Kellumtown. Other displaced families established communities in Georgetown, Pickettown, Bell Fork, and Sandy Run. The latter communities have since been absorbed by Jacksonville. Colonel Gillette had planned to retire near the small village of Marine, ironically named after a local family whose surname was Marine, but lost his land to the acquisition, as well.

Construction of Camp Lejeune caused a population explosion in the small town of about 800 inhabitants, as new workers migrated to the area. Growth continued to be fueled by both young Marine families and military retirees. Today, Jacksonville&#x27;s primary industry is retail sales and services. The primary migration draw continues to be the U.S. Marine Corps.

The Bank of Onslow and Jacksonville Masonic Temple, Mill Avenue Historic District, and Pelletier House and Wantland Spring are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2016, Jacksonville became the first jurisdiction to adopt a paid holiday honoring the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which made slavery in the United States and its territories illegal. The resolution of adoption mentions &quot;the prevention of the modern slavery&quot; which it describes as &quot;human trafficking&quot;, including child labor and military service.

==History==
In 1728, Edmund Ennett established a ferry on the banks of the New River. Some of Ennett&#x27;s descendants still reside in the area. Originally called &quot;Ennett&#x27;s Ferry,&quot; it became a key element in the Post road linking Suffolk, Virginia with Charleston, South Carolina. By 1759, two ferries operated there, one from each bank of New River. Robert Snead was the proprietor of the ferry on the north shore, so the community that developed on the banks of the crossing site became known as &quot;Sneads Ferry.&quot; Caroline Pearson propelled the ferry until it was replaced with a bridge in 1939. The village is heavily dependent on the seafood industry. The village annually catches over 385 tons of shrimp, 25 tons of flounder, and approximately 493 tons of other seafood like clams, scallops, oysters, mullet, spot, grouper, soft shell and hard shell crabs, sea bass, and more. The town holds an annual Shrimp Festival to honor the local seafood industry.

The Yopps Meeting House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.

== Libraries ==
Beginning in 1991, the original Sneads Ferry Library was housed in an old First Citizen&#x27;s Bank and the new Environmental Education Center and Sneads Ferry Branch Library began construction in September 2012, with a grand opening in April 2014. Onslow County, North Carolina, in which Sneads Ferry is located, has three other libraries: the Jacksonville Main Library, the Richlands Branch Library, and the Swansboro Branch Library.

<doc id="128113" wikidata="Q780330" url="?curid=128113" title="Carrboro, North Carolina">
<text>Carrboro is a town in Orange County in the U.S. state of North Carolina. The population was 21,295 at the 2020 census. The town, which is part of the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill combined statistical area, was named after North Carolina industrialist Julian S. Carr.

Located directly west of Chapel Hill, home of the University of North Carolina&#x27;s flagship campus, Carrboro has a reputation as one of the most progressive communities in the Southeastern United States. It was the first municipality in North Carolina to elect an openly gay mayor (Michael R. Nelson in 1995) and the first municipality in the state to grant domestic-partner benefits to same-sex couples. In October 2002, Carrboro was among the first municipalities in the South to adopt resolutions opposing the Iraq War and the USA PATRIOT Act.
==History==
The history of Carrboro is similar to the history of many mill towns in North Carolina and largely parallels the histories of the State University Railroad and the Alberta Cotton Mill. Located just west of Chapel Hill, Carrboro was originally known as West End. It was settled in 1882 near the terminus &quot;in a vacant field&quot; of the State University Railroad spur from University Station in Glenn, North Carolina. (State law required that the railway be at least from the university campus &quot;to guard against possible damage to student morals and habits of study,&quot; or as it was more cynically put, &quot;to discourage students from leaving on the weekends and spending their money elsewhere.) Settlement in West End increased after 1898 when Thomas F. Lloyd of Chapel Hill built a steam-powered grist mill near the depot. This would become the Alberta Cotton Mill, and in 1900 the town briefly called itself Lloydville in his honor.

Durham businessman Julian S. Carr bought the mill and other nearby buildings in 1909, adding them to the chain of mills that became Durham Hosiery Mills. In 1911, West End was incorporated and named Venable in honor of chemistry professor and University of North Carolina president Francis Preston Venable, but only two years later was renamed Carrboro, after Carr provided electric power for the community and expanded the mill. In addition to the university and the textile mills, the railroad depot in Carrboro also served the local lumber industry, and in the 1920s and 1930s Carrboro became a major hub in the hardwood cross-tie market.

A 1920s building boom in Carrboro sparked by a fire in the downtown business district ended as business at the Durham Hosiery Mills declined towards the end of the decade. The Great Depression also took an economic toll and in 1930 the company closed Mill No. 4, the original Alberta Cotton Mill. Passenger service on the train line ended in 1936. In 1938 Durham Hosiery Mills closed Mill No. 7, across Main Street from Mill No. 4, and ceased operations altogether.
&quot;Robert &#x27;Bob&#x27; Drakeford, the town&#x27;s first black mayor, elected in 1977, recalled when Carrboro was a sundown town, where people of color knew not to be out after dark.&quot;

During World War II, Mill No. 7 became the site of a munitions factory. After the war, Pacific Mills bought both Mills No. 4 and 7 and operated them as Carrboro Woolen Mills. When Pacific Mills closed in the mid-1960s - the final activity at the mill was sorting and shipping BVD underwear - Carrboro was no longer able to depend upon the textile industry to sustain itself. The University of North Carolina and other businesses in the area were growing rapidly and provided work in a wide range of occupations and locations.

The mill remained abandoned for nearly a decade and changed hands several times. In 1975 the owner, with the assent of the Carrboro Board of Aldermen, intended to have it demolished. A community petition and fund-raising effort provided for its restoration as Carr Mill Mall. It has since grown into a bustling hub of activity, hosting many businesses such as Weaver Street Market.

In addition to the Alberta Mill Complex, the Carrboro Commercial Historic District, Thomas and Mary Hogan House, and Thomas F. Lloyd Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Carrboro&#x27;s origin story is closely tied to its historic railroad station, which was built in 1913. Initially known as &quot;West Of&quot; due to its proximity to Chapel Hill, the area around the station developed into a thriving settlement, eventually becoming the town of Carrboro.

===Name===
Carrboro was named for Julian S. Carr, a UNC alumnus, trustee, honorary degree recipient, industrialist, and philanthropist whose company brought electric power to the town. Carr was also a white supremacist who opposed black suffrage, defended the Ku Klux Klan and lynchings, and endorsed of the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; interpretation of the Civil War, during which he served as a private in the Confederate States Army. A 2011 letter to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill student newspaper, &quot;The Daily Tar Heel&quot;, called attention to Carr&#x27;s remarks at the 1913 dedication of the &quot;Silent Sam&quot; monument on the University of North Carolina campus. The following passage, quoted in the letter, has become locally famous:

As a result of this publication, a petition to change the town&#x27;s name arose, and former mayor Jim Porto in 2016 asked the Board of Aldermen to rename the town. According to Alderwoman Jacquie Gist, &quot;Changing Carrboro&#x27;s name is not a realistic option&quot;. A name change would require legislative approval, and according to former mayor Mark Chilton, &quot;You change it to something besides Carrboro, you&#x27;re really asking to be interfered with by the state legislature, and it won&#x27;t be for the best.&quot; In 2019, Carrboro erected a truth plaque, distancing the town from the values and actions of Julian Carr.

The Carrboro Board of Aldermen passed a resolution in 2017 calling for the removal of &quot;Silent Sam&quot;.

==Geography==

Carrboro&#x27;s 27510 zip code covers the town&#x27;s core, and is an enclave surrounded on all sides by Chapel Hill&#x27;s 27516 zip code, which also covers the outer areas of Carrboro.

===Diversity===
In the early 1990s, a sizable influx of Latino immigrants began moving to Carrboro, attracted by jobs in the building and service trades. The Hispanic population of Carrboro increased by 936% between 1990 and 2003, to 12% of the Carrboro population.
As these immigrants settled in Carrboro, they brought the food and culture of their native countries to the town. Carrboro is now home to three Latino &quot;tiendas&quot; (grocery stores). Other businesses, including national grocery chains like Food Lion, adapted to the change in demographics by stocking a wider variety of Central and South American food products.

The Human Rights Center serves the Latinos, day laborers, Burmese and Karen populations. It petitioned the town government to adopt the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which it did in 2009.

As with neighboring Chapel Hill, affordable housing has become a pressing local issue.

==Arts and culture==

===Attractions===
One of Carrboro&#x27;s attractions is the Carrboro Farmer&#x27;s Market, which features local organic produce, locally produced cheeses, baked goods, and handmade crafts. Created in 1977, the Market was one of the first in the area to link farmers directly with their customers. The Market requires that everything sold must be produced within a radius of Carrboro. In addition to the Carrboro Farmers Market, the town eateries and specialty food shops have also garnered regional and national acclaim for their strong support of locally produced food. Carrboro is a favorite destination of UNC students for its relatively large number and diversity of restaurants. In 2005, Carrboro was named one of the 100 best art towns in America.

Two music venues that host national and regional acts are located in Carrboro. The ArtsCenter has featured nationally known roots music acts, such as David Lindley, Leon Russell, and Dr. John as well as internationally known artists including Richard Thompson and k.d. lang. The ArtsCenter also holds art classes, dance classes, and art exhibitions. It was founded 1974 and moved from Main Street to its new location on Roberson Street summer 2023. The Cat&#x27;s Cradle, open for more than 50 years, hosts a diverse range of national and international musicians and performers like Nirvana, Public Enemy, John Mayer, Joan Baez, and Iggy Pop.

The 84-seat Dirty South Institute (DSI) Comedy Theater in Carrboro, opened in 2006, boasted a local company of 50+ active performers and a national network of comedians. It was the home of the DSI Comedy School, which offered classes to the public every month in the art of improv, stand-up and sketch comedy. Amid scandal, DSI Comedy Theater closed on August 28, 2017. The space re-opened a few months later as the PIT Chapel Hill, a branch of the Peoples Improv Theater founded by Ali Reza Farahnakian, a former “Saturday Night Live” writer and UNC alumnus.

The Carrboro Historic District, north of downtown, contains the distinctive architecture of the approximately 150 mill houses built by Lloyd and Carr for the mill workers at the Alberta Cotton Mill and their families. Many of these homes have since been razed, but numerous others have been restored; a number of these homes, centered on Shelton Street, are occupied by (particularly graduate) students at the nearby University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, however, increasing housing costs have resulted in a downwards trend in the student population of this area.

===Annual cultural events===
The town is known for the Carrboro Music Festival, a free all-day event which celebrates local music with over 150 acts performing at dozens of locations in the downtown area. The music festival began in 1998 as the Fête de la Musique, and was held on the summer solstice. In 2002, the name of the event was changed to the Carrboro Music Festival and, in order to increase attendance by avoiding the summer heat, moved to the fall. In 2013, the festival expanded to two days. Carrboro is also home to the annual West End Poetry Festival, which draws in a great selection of local poets.

In November, Carrboro hosts its annual film festival. The Carrboro Film Festival was started in 2006 by Carrboro Arts Committee members Jackie Helvey and Nic Beery, with support from Board of Aldermen and the Carrboro Recreation and Parks Department. The idea behind the Carrboro Film Festival is to promote local area shorts films that are twenty minutes or less. The first year, there were nearly 100 entires. From those, a day filled with fabulous films was created, and that tradition has continued over the years. In 2013, the festival expanded to two days, accepting submissions from across the entire state of North Carolina and beyond.

Carrboro has also had a yearly Pride Promenade, where a rainbow goat is escorted down to the town commons where food trucks, Drag shows and other events take place.

===Libraries===
Carrboro is home to two branches of the Orange County Public Library System: the Carrboro Branch Library and the Carrboro Cybrary. Carrboro Branch Library is located in McDougle Elementary and Middle School. Services include a medium-sized circulating collection of books, audiobooks, movies on DVD and VHS, and music CDs; computer and Internet access; magazines; and local and national newspapers. Carrboro Cybrary is located in the Century Center in downtown Carrboro. Services include a small circulating collection of contemporary fiction, nonfiction, audiobooks, and Spanish and English language learning materials; computer, Internet, and wireless access; magazines; and local and national newspapers. Orange County residents may access these services free of charge, and nonresidents may access the computers free of charge.

==Sports==
Carrboro is home to some of the originators of the modern hooping movement. In 2001, Vivian Spiral began hooping on the Weaver Street Market lawn during the weekly music events. Julia Hartsell joined her for the 2002 music season. Jonathan Baxter, founder of the HoopPath, also lives and teaches hooping in Carrboro. The first annual HoopPath Retreat was held Carrboro in 2007 and still happens there every year. The Hoop Convergence, started in 2008, is also held annually in Carrboro and the surrounding area. Synergy FlowArts, a manufacturer of hoops and other flow props, was formed in 2010.

<text>The town of Hillsborough is the county seat of Orange County, North Carolina, United States, and is located along the Eno River. The population was 6,087 in 2010, but it grew rapidly to 9,660 by 2020.

Its name was unofficially shortened to &quot;Hillsboro&quot; during the 19th century. In the late 1960s, residents voted to change the name back to its original, historic spelling.

==History==

===Native American history===
Local Native American groups had lived in the Hillsborough area for thousands of years by the time Spanish explorers entered the region. The Great Indian Trading Path, used by generations of Native Americans, crossed the Eno River in this area. Historic Siouan-language tribes such as the Occaneechi and the Eno were living in the Hillsborough area at the time of European contact. The English explorer John Lawson recorded visiting &quot;Occaneechi Town&quot; here when he traveled through North Carolina in 1701. The tribes suffered high losses due to new infectious diseases brought by Europeans and conflicts with northern Native American groups; most of the survivors were eventually pushed out of their territory by British and other European settlers.

English settlers developed Hillsborough near the site of the former Occaneechi village and its river fords. In the early 18th century, some Occaneechi left Hillsborough for Virginia, though they returned to the area around 1780.

In the 1980s, an archaeological team from UNC-Chapel Hill excavated a historic Occaneechi farming village in this area. A replica of an Occaneechi village was built close to their original site of settlement near the Eno River.

===Colonial period and Revolutionary War===

Hillsborough was founded in 1754 and was first owned, surveyed, and mapped by William Churton (a surveyor for Earl Granville). Originally to be named Orange, it was first named Corbin Town (for Francis Corbin, a member of the governor&#x27;s council and one of Granville&#x27;s land agents). It was renamed in 1759 as Childsburgh (in honor of Thomas Child, the attorney general for North Carolina from 1751 to 1760 and another of Granville&#x27;s land agents). It was not until 1766 that it was named Hillsborough, after Wills Hill, then the Earl of Hillsborough, the British secretary of state for the colonies, and a relative of royal Governor William Tryon.

Hillsborough was an early Piedmont colonial town where court was held, and was the scene of some pre-Revolutionary War tensions. In the late 1760s, tensions between Piedmont farmers and county officers arose in the Regulator movement, which had its strongest support in Hillsborough. With specie scarce, many inland farmers found themselves unable to pay their taxes and resented the consequent seizure of their property. Local sheriffs sometimes kept taxes for their own gain and sometimes charged twice for the same tax. Heavy-handed and corrupt local officials and Governor William Tryon&#x27;s conspicuous consumption in the construction of a new governor&#x27;s mansion at New Bern exacerbated the movement&#x27;s resentment.

As the western districts were under-represented in the colonial legislature, farmers had difficulty gaining redress from the legislature. Ultimately, the frustrated farmers took to arms and closed the court in Hillsborough, dragging those they considered corrupt officials through the streets. Tryon and North Carolina militia troops marched to the region and defeated the Regulators at the Battle of Alamance in May 1771. Several trials were held after the war, resulting in the hanging of six Regulators at Hillsborough on June 19, 1771.

The North Carolina Provincial Congress met in Hillsborough from August 20 – September 10, 1775, at the outset of the American Revolution. The North Carolina General Assembly met here in 1778, 1782, and 1783. The town was also the site of the first North Carolina ratifying convention, which met July 21 – August 2, 1788, to deliberate and determine whether or not to ratify the Constitution recommended to the states by the Constitutional Convention held in Philadelphia the previous summer. With the hope of effecting the incorporation of a Bill of Rights into the frame of government, delegates voted (184–84) to neither ratify nor reject the Constitution. During the bicentennial celebration of the writing and ratification of the Constitution, a historical marker was placed at the site (now the Hillsborough Presbyterian Church) commemorating the convention.

William Hooper, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was buried in the Presbyterian Church cemetery in October 1790. However, his remains were later reinterred at Guilford Court House Military Battlefield. His original gravestone remains in the town cemetery.

===Antebellum period and American Civil War===
Robert and Margaret Anna (née Robertson) Burwell ran a girl&#x27;s academy called the Burwell School from 1837 to 1857 in their home on Churton Street.

When the Civil War began, Hillsborough residents were reluctant to support secession, but many men went off to fight for the Confederacy. In March 1865, Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston and his troops wintered just outside Hillsborough at the Alexander Dickson home. In 1982 this house was moved downtown in order to preserve it from commercial development; it now serves as the Hillsborough Welcome Center.

After sweeping through the South on his March to the Sea, Union General William T. Sherman camped in Raleigh. He offered an armistice to Johnston, who agreed to meet to discuss terms of surrender. Johnston, traveling east from Hillsborough, and Sherman, traveling west from Raleigh along the Hillsborough-Raleigh Road, met approximately halfway near present-day Durham (then Durham Station) at the home of James and Nancy Bennett. This farmhouse is now known as Bennett Place. The two generals met three times on April 17, 18, and finally on April 26, when they agreed on the final terms of surrender. Johnston surrendered 89,270 Southern troops who were still active in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. This was the largest surrender of troops during the war, and effectively ended the conflict.

===Historic sites===
There are numerous historical sites to visit in Hillsborough, including some dating to the late eighteenth century. More than 100 surviving late eighteenth and nineteenth-century structures help illustrate its history of prominence in the early period of the state.

In addition, numerous secondary buildings, bridges, mill sites and dams along the Eno River document the local history. Native American relics have been recovered from the sites of ancient villages thousands of years old.

====Alexander Dickson House====
The Hillsborough Visitors Center operates from this late-18th century Quaker-plan house. It was moved from its original location southeast of Hillsborough to its present location in the historic district. The site includes an office used by Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston.

====Old Orange County Courthouse====
The Old Orange County Courthouse is an 1844 Greek-revival building designed and built by local builder John Berry. The courthouse is still used for county judicial business. The circa 1760s Hillsborough Clock located atop the town courthouse was once believed to be a gift from King George III, but its origin is currently unknown. It was first placed in the town church, then moved to the Market House. In 1781, David Fanning and the Tories raided the town, seized the bell of the clock, and threw it into the Eno River, but it was fished out by the people at war&#x27;s end, the clock was fixed, given new weights, and placed in the courthouse where it still works today over 250 years later. It is one of the five oldest functioning tower clocks in the USA today.

====Ayr Mount====
Ayr Mount is an 1815 Federal-era plantation house, restored and furnished with period antiques and fine art. The estate includes the -long Poet&#x27;s Walk.

====Green Hill====
Green Hill is a Federal-style plantation house. It was built circa 1750-1784 for George Johnston. It was moved in the late 1960s from its original location approximately 12 miles south of Hillsborough.

==== Parks-Richmond House (The Inn at Teardrops) ====

The name comes from the teardrop-shaped glass on the front doors and the molding around the eaves of the house. The property was owned by Edmund Fanning until 1768, when he sold it to Thomas King, an inn keeper.

The main body of the present structure might be King&#x27;s old inn. Notable eighteenth-century owners include General Thomas Person, Peter Malett, William Duffy, and John Taylor, who was clerk of the Superior Court from 1800 to 1845.

In 1938, the J.W. Richmond family bought the property and renovated the house as a private residence. After additional renovations, Richmond adapted it as &#x27;The Inn at Teardrops&#x27;, a bed and breakfast.

====Margaret Lane Cemetery====
Margaret Lane Cemetery, sometimes called the Old Slave Cemetery, first appears in written records in 1885. It is believed that Peter Brown Ruffin, a landowner and employer to the west of Hillsborough, bought the two lots that comprise the cemetery from the town in 1854 to use as a burial ground.

====Historic Occoneechee Speedway Trail====
Occoneechee Speedway, just outside Hillsborough, was one of the first two NASCAR tracks to open in 1949. The track was made up of dirt. It is one of two tracks remaining from that inaugural season, Martinsville Speedway being the other. Today, the site has been preserved as a trail.

The Historic Occoneechee Speedway Trail (HOST) is a -trail located on at the site of the former Speedway. Bill France and the early founders of NASCAR bought land to build a oval track at Hillsborough, but opposition from local religious leaders prevented the track from being built in the town.

<text>Arapahoe ( ) is a town in Pamlico County, North Carolina, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 416. Arapahoe shares many of its roles and duties with Minnesott Beach, North Carolina. It is part of the New Bern, North Carolina Micropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
Arapahoe was founded a few years after New Bern, North Carolina by settlers leaving the New Bern colony. This area was settled in 1703 on the old Indian trail from the big bend in the river heading west to Core Point. The community was called “Bethany Crossroads”. That Indian trail is still in use today but is now called North Carolina Highway 306. In 1886 Bob Hardison, after discussing it with his friend Bob Bowden decided to apply to the U.S. Postal Department for a Post office to be located at “Bethany Crossroads” in Pamlico County. They filled out an application and both signed it. When it was returned to them it was addressed to “Bob’s Town”, the reason being that there was already a “Bethany Crossroads” in the vicinity of Fayetteville. Neither of the Bobs liked “Bob’s Town” so they had to come up with a different name. After a lengthy discussion Bob Hardison said “Well if you have no objection, we will name it after my old white horse, Arapahoe.” So it was decided and a new application filed. It was likely a year or longer before all paperwork was completed, but “Bethany Crossroads” was no more and there by named the Town of Arapahoe. Arapahoe is a Native American tribe whose historic territory spanned regions of present-day Wyoming and Colorado.

== Government ==
Arapahoe government is headed by the mayor of the town. Along with the mayor, there are several town commissioners, a planning board, and a volunteer fire department. The mayor and commissioners are elected to two year terms. The town hall is a small building located along the main street (NC 306) in Arapahoe.

== Education ==
Public Education&lt;br&gt;
Arapahoe has education opportunities available for children grades Kindergarten through High School. Arapahoe Charter School was opened in 1997 to replace Arapahoe Elementary School. There are currently 560 students enrolled, with 40 teachers available. Arapahoe Charter School has a student:teacher ratio of 14:1.

Arapahoe Charter School is currently a K-12 school housed in a new $9 million facility opening for the 2018-19 school year.

Arapahoe is also home to the Don Lee Center, a Methodist founded center for camping and recreation as well as for renowned public environmental education.

Higher Education&lt;br&gt;
For Higher Education, Pamlico Community College (PCC) allows for associate degrees in many areas. From PCC, one can transfer to East Carolina University to complete a bachelors and graduates degree. PCC is located only minutes from Arapahoe along NC Highway 306.

== Business ==
Arapahoe is the home of several small businesses. The largest industry in Arapahoe is agriculture. Other businesses include seafood management, home improvement, florist, food service, and other service industries. Another industry that appears to be growing in the Arapahoe area is bio-diesel production.

Another large business located in the Arapahoe area is summer camps. Within the Arapahoe area, there are four camps: Camp Sea Gull for boys (YMCA affiliated), Camp Seafarer for girls (YMCA affiliated), Camp Don Lee (Methodist), and Camp Caroline. Most of these camps have their largest programs in the summer months, but also hold other events throughout the year. For example, Camp Seafarer and Camp Seagull offer a Spring Break camp, Mother-Daughter weekends, and Father-Son weekends among others.

Opportunities for businesses in Arapahoe are plentiful. Business not currently available include the hotel industry, entertainment services, gas stations/convenience stores, and several others. As stated in an article from New Bern&#x27;s Sun Journal, the hotel business opportunities lost from Arapahoe (and subsequently relished by New Bern) can be equated to millions of dollars during the camp season due to the high proportion of camp families, events, and visitors to the recreational opportunities.

<doc id="128120" wikidata="Q2025148" url="?curid=128120" title="Oriental, North Carolina">
<text>Oriental is one of nine incorporated municipalities in Pamlico County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 880, according to the 2020 census. It is part of the New Bern Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

The area was settled by Native Americans, who fished and farmed in the creeks and river long before Europeans arrived. Land records date grants from the King of England to colonial farmers, although the King didn&#x27;t actually own the land, and several current residents of the area can trace their family&#x27;s genealogy to these times. The area was the haunt of pirates in the early days of European dominance. The famous pirate Edward Teach, or Blackbeard made his home in Bath, to the north of Oriental. The Midgettes (also Midyettes) and other old families who still have descendants in the town came much later, in the late 19th century.

The town of Oriental was named after the Sailing Steamer Oriental. Built in Philadelphia in 1861, the ship was used as a Federal transport ship in the Civil War. She met her fate a year after being launched, run aground in May 1862, when she was wrecked off Bodie Island, 33 miles north of Cape Hatteras. Her passengers and crew were saved.

The United States Post Office Department established a post office in 1886 in what had been called Smith&#x27;s Creek. Lou Midyette was named postmaster. Postmaster Midyette&#x27;s wife, Rebecca, thought the village needed a better name. One story says that she had found the nameplate from the wrecked sailing steamer &quot;Oriental&quot; on the beaches of the Outer Banks and thought that name was more suitable. Another version of the story says she just saw the nameplate in a Manteo home. Either way the name &quot;Oriental&quot; made an impression on her. The village became known as Oriental a few years after the post office was established and was incorporated in 1899.

From the early 20th century, Oriental&#x27;s economy was supported by lumber, fishing and farming. Train service stopped in the 1950s. The last sawmill closed in the early 1960s. Fishing, agriculture, some tourism and marine related businesses now lead the local economy. The town gained national publicity in 2016 when WalMart closed the only food store in town. Fishing trawlers still grace the small harbor, bringing in a catch of shrimp, crab or perhaps flounder depending on the season.

==Local destinations==

The nameplate of the city&#x27;s namesake Sailing Steamer Oriental has been lost, but a porthole from the ship is in the Oriental History Museum. The Oriental History Museum offers enlightening displays of Oriental&#x27;s early years. The Museum and the Oriental Tourism Board have combined to develop a 1.2-mile historical walking tour covering thirty-seven sites.

Two local festivals attract visitors. The Spirit of Christmas, always held in early December, consists of local businesses holding open houses with hot cider and treats, while the local churches hold Nativity plays and host Christmas music concerts. There is sometimes a boat parade in the harbor, where locals decorate their yachts with Christmas lights. The second large town festival, The Croaker Festival, is an arts and vendor event which benefits the county&#x27;s nonprofits. It culminates in a fireworks display held during the first weekend each July. In addition, the Oriental Rotary Club sponsors an annual catch-and-release tarpon fishing tournament the last weekend in July (2008 was the 16th year) and, on New Year&#x27;s Eve, the Oriental dragon makes a run through town twice (at 8 p.m. and at midnight). The Oriental Cup Regatta is held the third Saturday of September, and there are boat races most Saturdays from May through September, and very informal ones most Wednesdays, too. Oriental hosts a Celebration of the Arts festival in mid-September, and has other art festivals throughout the year. The Town sponsors free evening concerts once each summer month which have been well attending by county residents and visitors from neighboring Craven and Carteret counties. The Oriental Tourism Board actively promotes weddings in Oriental and has published a Website that lists venues and service providers.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (16.79%) is water.

==History==

Vandemere is situated on a point where Vandemere Creek flows into the Bay River. It was incorporated in 1874 and was the county seat from 1872 (when Pamlico County was formed) to 1876.

Many of the descendants of the first colonists in North Carolina are still living in Vandemere today and many of the names live on, both in the names of the people and the places.

In 1699, a treaty was forged between the English Crown and the &quot;Bay River Indians&quot;. Early settlers came from England, but there are also reports of French Huguenots and others including Dutch and Flemish.

By the 18th century, there are written records of some European habitation in the Vandemere area. Records show that there was a Native American people who lived &quot;at the head of Vandemore&#x27;s Creek.&quot; These early records show various spellings of the name of Vandemere, most showing Dutch or Flemish origin.

As early as 1679, there are records showing a &quot;Tho. Vandermoller&quot; being witness to a will, and in 1882 a land grant record that refers to &quot;&quot;Jno. Vandemore.&quot;

==Recent events==

On August 27, 2011, there was a devastating flood caused by Hurricane Irene, demolishing just over 100 homes. Local contractors aided the attempt to repair, and in some cases, even build new houses. Officials have upped the standards on flood regulations, requiring such items as higher outlets and raised houses.

<text>Topsail Beach is a town in Pender County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 383 at the 2012 census. It is part of the Wilmington, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Local folklore claims the name, Topsail (pronounced Tops’l), originated during the 1700s when pirate ships, including Blackbeard, roamed the coastal waters. Historians explain that marauding pirates hid their ships in the channel behind the island and waited for passing merchant ships loaded with goods. The pirates would pursue and attack the merchants, claiming the cargoes as their own. Eventually, the merchants became aware of this infamous hiding place and began to watch for the tops of the pirates&#x27; sails showing over the rolling dunes - hence the name Topsail Island.

Prior to World War II, the only access to Topsail Island was by boat. Area residents frequently made this short trip to picnic and search for the pirate Blackbeard&#x27;s rumored buried treasure.

During World War II, the U.S. Navy took over the island and began a joint venture with Johns Hopkins University known as Operation Bumblebee. The waterway was dredged, roads were built, and fresh water was piped onto the island. Operation Bumblebee was the beginning of the space program for the United States Government. An arsenal center for the assembly and storage of rockets was built on the sound side of the island, and launching pads were constructed on the oceanfront. Concrete observation towers were built throughout the island to monitor the experimental launchings. Over 200 rocket launchings took place on the island between 1946 and 1948. When the testing program was dismantled, the government sold the island to the public. The Town of Topsail Beach was incorporated in 1963. Many of the original military structures still exist today, and several of the concrete observation towers have since been converted into private residences and places of business.

The Cape Fear Civil War Shipwreck Discontiguous District, US Naval Ordnance Testing Facility Assembly Building, US Naval Ordnance Testing Facility Control Tower, and US Naval Ordnance Testing Facility Observation Tower No. 2 are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Recreation==
Missiles and More Museum:
The Missiles and More Museum is housed in the Historical Assembly Building located at 720 Channel Blvd in Topsail Beach. The Museum is home to exhibits such as Pirates of the Carolinas, Operation Bumblebee, Camp Davis, The Towns of Topsail Island, Topsail&#x27;s Natural Beauty and Fragility, Traces of Native Americans on the Island and an International Shell Exhibit. On April 4, 2011, the WASP
(Women&#x27;s Air-force Service Pilots) exhibit was opened. This exhibit tells the story of the first women trained to fly American military aircraft.

<text>Hertford is a town and the county seat of Perquimans County, North Carolina, United States. The current population of Hertford, North Carolina is 1,912 based on the 2020 census. The US Census estimates the 2021 population at 1,925. The last official US Census in 2010 recorded the population at 2,143. Hertford is located in North Carolina&#x27;s Inner Banks region and is part of both the Elizabeth City Micropolitan Statistical Area and the Hampton Roads region. It is named after the county town of Hertford, England.

==History==

Hertford was originally incorporated in 1758 as the county seat for Perquimans County, first inhabited by the Yeopim Indians. County records show that the Yeopim chief Kalcacenin sold land to George Durant at the river mouth in March 1662, adjacent to land he had already sold to Samuel Pricklove. The area was settled soon afterward, and a brick house on the site, the Newbold-White House, has been dated by dendrochronology to 1730; it is the oldest known brick structure in the state.

Through the first part of the 20th century, Hertford thrived as a lumber town, making good use of the nearby river. The bridge that spanned the river was a floating bridge, made of steel and wood. When a boat came near and wanted passage, the bridge would be unhooked from one bank and allowed to float out of the way. When the boat had passed, lines were used to haul the free end of the bridge in and reconnect it. An swing bridge with S-shaped approaches is in use today. 

Hertford is the hometown of baseball pitcher Catfish Hunter. Disc jockey Wolfman Jack is buried in nearby Belvidere, and the record company he started is still located in Hertford.

The Church of the Holy Trinity, Cove Grove, Fletcher-Skinner-Nixon House and Outbuildings, Hertford Historic District, Land&#x27;s End, Newbold-White House, Samuel Nixon House, Old Neck Historic District, Perquimans County Courthouse, and Sutton-Newby House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

On July 7, 1920, Red Roach was lynched in downtown Roxboro.

On August 15, 1941, a mob of 500 attempted to lynch Cy Winstead, a 22-year-old black man, who was accused of raping a white woman and was being held at the Person county court house. The mob was held off with tear gas by local authorities led by Sheriff M. T. Clayton until Winstead could be safely transferred to the state prison in Raleigh. No injuries were reported. Ten men were indicted for the attempted lynching on October 16, 1941, on misdemeanor charges for &quot;unlawful assembly for unlawful purpose&quot;. To local shock, five of the men were found guilty, receiving prison terms ranging from 12 to 18 months. Winstead himself later pleaded guilty to assault with intent to commit rape and was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.

A parcel of land was divided into residential lots surrounding the depot in &quot;Harristown&quot;, with Harris owning every other lot. Within the next several years, lots were sold and homes built. Businesses began to open up to support the new residents, and on February 3, 1891, the town was incorporated as &quot;Ayden.&quot; Within a few years, the Carolina Christian College and the Free Will Baptist Seminary were established. By 1919, Ayden had full-time electricity supplied by the Ayden municipal light plant. In 1922, the Mutual Building and Loan Association of Ayden was organized to help families obtain mortgages to build homes in Ayden.

After experiencing difficult times during the Great Depression, and after the Second World War, the town began to grow. To accommodate the growth, commercial, cultural, religious, and other establishments were opened within and around Ayden. The community is still growing today, due to the continued development of Greenville as an industrial and economic center for eastern North Carolina.

The Ayden Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.

==History==
Established in February 1872, the town was named Farmville because all of its undertakings and activities were farm related. Among the influential founding fathers of Farmville, James Williams May and William Gray Lang made exceptional contributions to the towns development. Mr. James Williams May was a commissioner named in the original town charter. He donated sites for churches and was a business leader willing to invest his services and resources towards the success of the town. He was the grandson of Major Benjamin May. William Gray Lang served as a commissioner on the town board for more than 10 years. He also serviced on the executive committee appointed to establish the Tobacco Market in Farmville. The town grew slowly, with the 1880 census showing 111 in Farmville and 79 in Marlborough, a nearby unincorporated settlement along the wooden Historic Plank Road. The Marlborough settlement is now inside the town limits of Farmville. The cultivation of Tobacco in Pitt County and the Farmville area began in the 1890s, which helped bring the East Carolina Railway to Farmville in 1900. Most of buildings in downtown Farmville were built shortly after due to the economic boom the railroad helped begin. The Farmville Historic District and Benjamin May-Lewis House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Greenville ( ; ) is the county seat and most populous city of Pitt County, North Carolina, United States. It is the principal city of the Greenville, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area, and the 12th-most populous city in North Carolina. Greenville is the health, entertainment, and educational hub of North Carolina&#x27;s Tidewater and Coastal Plain. As of the 2020 census, there were 87,521 people in the city. The city has a high population density at 2,337.63 per square mile.

Many major companies have moved their regional, national, and international headquarters to Greenville.

Greenville is the home of East Carolina University, the fourth-largest university in the University of North Carolina System, and ECU Health Medical Center, the second largest hospital in North Carolina and the flagship hospital for ECU Health and the teaching hospital for the Brody School of Medicine.

==History==
===Founding===
Greenville formed in 1771 as &quot;Martinsborough&quot;, named after the Royal Governor Josiah Martin. In 1774 the town was moved to its present location on the south bank of the Tar River, west of its original site. In 1786, the name was changed to Greenesville in honor of General Nathanael Greene, the American Revolutionary War hero. It was later shortened to Greenville.

===19th century===
During Greenville&#x27;s early years, the Tar River was a navigable waterway, and by the 1860s there were several established steamboat lines transporting passengers and goods on the river. Cotton was the leading agricultural crop, and Greenville became a major cotton export center. Before the turn of the century, however, tobacco surpassed cotton and became the leading money crop. Greenville became one of the state&#x27;s leading tobacco marketing and warehouse centers.

===20th century===
For over a century, Greenville was recognized only as an important tobacco market and the home of a small state-supported college, chartered by the Legislature in March 1907 and named East Carolina Teacher&#x27;s Training School, a co-ed institution. By the mid 1960s, East Carolina College had become the third-largest state-supported college, and enrollment approached 8,000 students — twice the 1960 enrollment figure. In 1967, it became East Carolina University. ECU Medical School admitted its first four-year class in 1977. At the turn of the century, enrollment at ECU topped the 18,000 mark, and now exceeds 29,000 students.

Greenville&#x27;s current economic development began in 1963 when Empire Brush was recruited to the new Greenville Industrial Park, established by Greenville Industries, Inc. (a for-profit land holding company) in partnership with the Pitt County Development Commission (established by a voter referendum in 1957) and Greenville Utilities Commission. One of the community&#x27;s greatest successes came in 1968 when Burroughs Wellcome, a major pharmaceutical research and manufacturing firm, located a pharmaceutical development/manufacturing facility near the city. The site is now owned by Patheon, a Thermo Fisher Scientific company, which employs approximately 1,200 people. The city and Pitt County have also become home to many other major industries and businesses including Catalent, Attindas, Grady-White Boats, and Hyster-Yale Materials Handling.

====Hurricane Floyd====
In September 1999, Hurricane Floyd made landfall in eastern North Carolina, dropping nearly of rain during the hours of its passage. Many residents were not aware of the flooding until the water came into their homes. Most localized flooding happened overnight, and the Tar River suffered the worst flooding, exceeding 500-year flood levels along its lower stretches. An additional 20+ inches of rain had fallen prior in the month from the two passes of Hurricane Dennis.

Damages in Pitt County, alone were estimated at $1.6 billion (1999 USD, $1.87 billion 2006 USD). Some residents in Greenville had to swim six feet underwater to reach the front doors of their homes and apartments. Due to the heavy flooding in downtown Greenville, the East Carolina Pirates were forced to relocate their football game against #9 Miami to N.C. State&#x27;s Carter–Finley Stadium in Raleigh, where they beat the Hurricanes, 27–23.

===21st century===
In 2017, Greenville signed an agreement with Yeonsu District in South Korea to become sister cities.

===Voice of America/IBB===

Greenville was the largest transmitter site for the Voice of America shortwave broadcasts under the auspices of the U.S. government&#x27;s International Broadcasting Bureau. Both transmitter buildings and three large antenna &#x27;farms&#x27; were located just outside Greenville. The Greenville Transmitting Station provided shortwave broadcasts for U.S. government-funded, non-military, international broadcasting and served as a standby, alternate gateway for the Satellite Interconnect System to use to uplink programming, should the Washington, D.C., SIS gateway have become unavailable. The station was also a backup facility for uplinking programming to the Atlantic Ocean Region satellite and served as the primary return link of that satellite. For the VOA, the main target areas for the station&#x27;s shortwave broadcasts were Latin America, the Caribbean with special emphasis on Cuba, and Africa. Three complexes, one for management, distribution, and monitoring, and the other two for actual transmitting, formed an approximately equilateral triangle around Greenville. At one time, these formed the largest international broadcasting site in the world. Two of the three sites have been decommissioned.

<doc id="128145" wikidata="Q2029202" url="?curid=128145" title="Tryon, North Carolina">
<text>Tryon is a town in Polk County, on the southwestern border of North Carolina, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 1,562. Located in the escarpment of the Blue Ridge Mountains, today the area is affluent and a center for outdoor pursuits, equestrian activity, and fine arts.

Tryon Peak and the Town of Tryon are named for William Tryon, Governor of North Carolina from 1765 to 1771. He was honored for his negotiation with the Cherokee for a treaty during a period of conflict following the French and Indian War.

==History==

===Cherokee hunting ground===
The area which Tryon now occupies was originally part of the Cherokee hunting grounds of Western North Carolina. Archaeological evidence dates indigenous peoples&#x27; occupation of the site to the end of the last ice age, more than 11,000 years ago. Successive cultures occupied the river valleys. Semi-permanent villages appeared in the area by about 8,000 B.C.

They later developed towns with a democratic political structure, developing religion, domesticated crops, pottery and skilled, powerful archery. The culture developed cultivated vegetables, and hunted and fished. Each historic Cherokee village had a peace chief, war chief, and priest.

===Spanish discovery===

Having landed near present-day Panama City, Florida on May 30, 1539, Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto reputedly traveled up to the area of present-day Spartanburg, South Carolina and then north into western North Carolina. Traveling on horses, de Soto and 1,000 men arrived in North Carolina in mid-May 1540. In search of gold, de Soto explored the area of Asheville area and met with the Cherokee in their village of Xuala, the area now known as Tryon. After a day or two, de Soto continued his journey with provisions provided by the Cherokee.

Luys Hernandez de Biedma, one of de Soto&#x27;s officers, wrote of a group of Spanish men who made their way to Xuala on May 21, 1540:

The next day, they went to Xuala which is a town on a plain between some rivers; its chief was so well provisioned that he gave to the Christians however much they asked for: slaves, corn, little dogs [probably opossums]… and however much he had.

From there, de Soto went to &quot;Gauxuile&quot; (since developed as Asheville), which in Cherokee meant &quot;The place where they race,&quot; named for the walk around the perimeter of the village.

===Early English settlement, French and Indian War===
In the earliest periods of settlement, the British traders and Cherokee enjoyed peaceful relations. Most of the British colonists settled in the coastal areas, where they had more contact with Algonquian-speaking peoples. A treaty signed in 1730 resulted in a greater influx of white traders and settlers to Cherokee territory. An early home, Seven Hearths, was built in 1740, and it is reputedly the oldest clapboard house in the county. It was moved to its present location in 1934. A log cabin that served as quarters for enslaved African Americans was also built about 1740. It was moved and rebuilt next to Seven Hearths in the 1930s.

The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years War, primarily between England and France, ended the peace that had existed between the Cherokee and the English settlers. Both the French and the English recruited Native American allies to aid their militias. The French were allied with the Creek people (Muscogee), traditional competitors of the Cherokee. The French tried to make allies of the Cherokee as well, who had been affiliated with the British because of their trading history. The French encouraged the Shawnee to raid settlements of the English.

As conflict and tension increased, the British built defensive forts along the frontier, including the &quot;Block House&quot; near the future Tryon. Tensions with the Cherokee continued after Britain defeated France in the large war. The Cherokee were resisting repeated incursions into their territory by English colonists.

In 1767 William Tryon, governor of the North Carolina Colony from 1765 to 1771), traveled to the area and negotiated a peace treaty with the Cherokee. They established a boundary line between a location near Greenville, South Carolina, the highest point on White Oak Mountain (renamed Tryon Peak by the settlers). Settlers, though, did not commit to the boundary. With the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, some Cherokee hoped to expel the white settlers from their lands.

In the spring of 1776, Cherokee met on Round Mountain and planned an attack on the &quot;Block House&quot;, Earl&#x27;s Fort in Landrum, South Carolina, and Young&#x27;s Fort near the current town of Mill Spring, North Carolina. Aware of the plans, a Cherokee named Skyuka went to the &quot;Block House&quot;, where he warned his friend Capt. Thomas Howard of the impending attacks. Howard and the assembled local militia took a trail toward Round Mountain, where they met and defeated the Cherokee at a gap in the valley, now known as Howard Gap. Settlers honored Skyuka by the naming of Skyuka Creek, Skyuka Road, and the YMCA Camp Skyuka on Mount Tryon.

===Post office===
In 1839 a post office was established at the Top of Howard Gap and Holberts Cove Roads run by the Thompson Family, named the Tryon Post office ,In early Polk what is now the Saluda township was called the Tryon township, present day Tryon was in the Columbus Township ;until Tryon city was established in 1885 both were named after Governor Tryon.

===Rail service and hospitality===
By 1877 the railroad provided regular transportation from South Carolina seaports around Charleston, SC to North Carolina, Tennessee, and the Ohio Valley. The particular spot that became the town of Tryon was the point where construction of the railroad to Asheville stopped for two years. West of Tryon, the railroad ascends the Blue Ridge along the Saluda Grade, which was the steepest railroad grade in the country before it became inactive.

At the peak of railroad expansion in 1885, Tryon was incorporated. By the 1890s, the railway made six daily stops in Tryon. The current depot building, built in 1922, is the third depot built. After expansion of individual automobile use, railroads restructured their offerings and passenger service to Tryon ended in 1968.

Oak Hall, originally built as the Tryon Hotel in 1881, is located on a bluff that looks over Trade Street. It had notable guests into the 20th century, such as Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, British film actor David Niven, Sherlock Holmes actor William Gillette, writer F. Scott Fitzgerald, composer George Gershwin, First Lady Mrs. Calvin Coolidge, Lady Nancy Astor, and Mrs. George C. Marshall, wife of the World War II general. The hotel was redeveloped as a condominium complex in the early 21st century.

Appreciative of the ice cream served at Misseldine&#x27;s drug store (previously located at the bank site on Trade Street), F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote the following ditty,

===Tropical Storm Helene===
On September 27, 2024, Helene caused considerable damage in Tryon.

==Geography==
The town&#x27;s original boundary was established as a circle with a radius of three quarters of a mile. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
Tryon is located near a &quot;thermal belt&quot;, an area generally free of dew and frost, which provides an enjoyable climate year-round.

The mountain climate attracted many of Tryon&#x27;s visitors as it developed as a resort, and residents, some of whom have second homes here. In this region of the Blue Ridge mountains, air may be warmer on the slopes than in the base of a valley, particularly in the spring and fall. It has longer periods of warm weather throughout the year, producing greater crop yields. Tryon has a climate similar to comparable areas of the Piedmont.

More than half of Tryon&#x27;s full-time residents are &quot;transplants&quot; from other areas of the country. Some have helped to create the cultural center that continues to attract writers, educators, artists, and professional people to the Tryon area.

===Religion===
Tryon&#x27;s churches include: Grace Foothills Church (PCA), which meets in the historic Tryon Theatre; Tryon Presbyterian Church (PCUSA), Holy Cross Church &amp; Chapel (Episcopal), Congregational Church, St. John the Baptist Catholic Church, First Baptist Church, Tryon United Methodist Church, Trinity Lutheran Church LCMS. Other churches include Garrison Chapel Baptist Church.

The Good Shepherd Episcopal Church, originally a slave chapel known as St. Andrews, located on the Coxe Plantation, was moved to Tryon in 1955, on Jackson Road. Its African-American congregation has kept its original furnishings and glass.

==Economy==

===Agriculture===
The southern exposure of Tryon&#x27;s hills supports the production of orchards and vineyards. Vineyards were established in the Pacolet Valley, on Old Howard Gap, and other Tryon locations. By the 1950s the industry suffered due to decline in railroad transportation and competition with Californian grapes. However, viticulture is beginning to make a comeback in the area; since the 1990s, several vineyards have been established in and around Tryon.

===Tourism===
Tryon has a long history as a tourism destination, particularly as a retreat for writers and artists.

The Pine Crest Inn was built in 1906 as a sanitarium for those with tuberculosis. Before the discovery of penicillin, rest in mountain air was considered helpful in the treatment of TB, which was often fatal. In 1917 the sanitarium was converted to an inn. Early in the inn&#x27;s history, hunters were attracted by its location, on the edge of hunting country. Swayback cabin, now more than 240 years old, hosted American writers Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald.

The inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Its dining room is ranked by AAA as four diamonds.

Tryon has also long been a center of equestrian-related tourism. Over the years, Tryon has served as a training location for the U.S. Olympic Equestrian team. In 2018, Tryon played host to the FEI World Equestrian Games, the “Horse Olympics,” which drew hundreds of thousands of visitors to the area.

==Culture==

===Arts===
;The Tryon Fine Arts Center
The Tryon Fine Arts Center, located on Melrose Avenue, is a visual and performing arts center that offers music, drama, film and other cultural programs. Founded in 1969, the non-profit organization also offers a number of classes in the arts. The center&#x27;s theater seats 345 individuals and has a system for the hearing impaired.

Located, exhibiting, or performing within the center are:
the Tryon Painters and Sculptors and the Carolina Photo Club. The Photo Club annually exhibits in January and February. The group, affiliated with the Photographic Society of America, meets monthly. It conducts an annual contest, and winning submissions are exhibited in the Tryon Fine Arts Center.

;Tryon Arts and Crafts School
Established in 1960, Tryon Arts and Crafts School provides creative opportunities &quot;through education, instruction, and expression of heritage and contemporary arts and crafts.&quot; In the 1950s local artists offered space in their homes for fine arts and crafts. The blizzard of 1959 was the impetus for creation of a formal organization. Grace Hall, a local resident who had been trapped in her home for three weeks, wrote to the &quot;Tryon Daily Bulletin&quot; with an idea: form a local crafts center so that area residents could learn skills for arts or crafts. If another blizzard hit, they would be better prepared for isolation. Many agreed, including architect Carter Brown and Tryon philanthropist Violet Parish-Watson.

In April 1960, 200 area residents pledged a one-dollar membership fee to support what would be called Tryon Crafts, Inc. &quot;Recapturing Tryon&#x27;s history as an artist&#x27;s colony,&quot; local artisans began selling work and teaching classes. Tryon Arts &amp; Crafts (named since 2004) is now located at 373 Harmon Field Road, adjacent to Harmon Field. The facility offers professional studios for a wide variety of arts, such as fiber arts, pottery, jewelry, lapidary, woodworking, multimedia and blacksmithing.

;Tryon Concert Association
The Tryon Concert Association has brought &quot;world-class artists&quot; to Tryon since its first sponsored concert in January 1955, when baritone Robert McFerrin gave a recital. Soon after this performance, McFerrin was the first African American to join the Metropolitan Opera Company of New York City. The Tryon Concert Association provides a series of four concerts from the fall through spring with high quality talent.

;Tryon Little Theater
Tryon Little Theater has been a vital part of the performing community since 1948. It performs four productions a year, plus classes and workshops at its Workshop on Highway 176. Auditions are always open to the public. The theater is also a partner in producing the Tryon Summer Youth Theater for ages 12–18.

;Tryon Youth Center
Tryon Youth Center, located in a building on US Highway 176, offers artistic, social and recreational programs for area young people. A Youth Center Summer Musical is produced annually at the Tryon Fine Arts Center.

;Children&#x27;s Theatre Festival
Children&#x27;s Theater Festival, organized in 1978, offers &quot;lively arts&quot; for children including: &quot;Eight to ten different performances, encompassing theater, music, storytelling, mime, dance, puppetry, and more are brought to Tryon on a Saturday in late March.&quot;

;Nina Simone Birthplace
Tryon is the birthplace of singer and piano player Nina Simone. Four African-American artists: Adam Pendleton, Ellen Gallagher, Rashid Johnson, and Julie Mehretu jointly bought her childhood home to preserve it. The home has been named a national treasure by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Nina Simone Plaza in downtown Tryon features a bronze sculpture by Zenos Frudakis.

=== Equestrian community ===
Colonel Charles C. Ross, U.S. Army (Retd.) is a local historian and former president of the Tryon Riding and Hunt Club. He said at a Polk County Historical Association meeting in April 2010, 
&quot;The horse is all important in Polk County. Horses provide sport, pleasure, entertainment, business, and the good country living. It can be said that horses are a way of life in our pleasant community here in rural North Carolina.&quot;

When Carter Brown came to Tryon from Michigan in 1917 , he opened the Pine Crest Inn, developing it as a resort for wealthy northerners. They could come here to ride horses or play golf during the winter months. In 1925 Brown founded and was the first president of the Tryon Riding and Hunt Club. Brown also helped organize the Tryon Horse Show and the Block House Steeplechase in 1929 and 1934, respectively.

Ross noted in 2010 that in their heyday, the Tryon Horse Show &quot;was so popular that the schools were let out and most businesses closed for the afternoon.&quot; The Tryon Horse Shows are held at the Foothills Equestrian Nature Center (FENCE). In 1956, the US Equestrian Team prepared and trained for the 1956 Olympics in Tryon. The Tryon Horse Show continues to be held; it is the third oldest horse show and a rated United States Equestrian Federation event.

Smaller shows are held at Harmon Field. Many local organizations, such as the Carolina Carriage Club, the Blue Ridge Hunter Jumper Association, Foothills Riding Club, and River Valley Pony Club also hold shows and events.
Morris, the Tryon Horse, stands at the center of Tryon. A large version of toys made by the Tryon Toymakers and Woodcarvers, the Tryon Horse was commissioned in1928 by the Tryon Riding and Hunt Club. The current Morris is the fifth generation; three of the previous versions succumbed to fire, mischievous kidnapping and age, and the fourth was refurbished with a fiberglass body. Morris serves as a billboard during the Tryon Horse Show and Block House Steeplechase Races. At Christmas, he is decorated with garland and a top hat.

In May 2012, a group of volunteers, together with the Town of Tryon and the &quot;Tryon Daily Bulletin&quot; (The World&#x27;s Smallest Daily Newspaper!), banded together to raise money to restore and maintain Morris, which was deteriorating. The enormous statue was &quot;kidnapped&quot; in the dead of night on June 8, 2012, and held for &quot;ransom&quot;. The refurbished Morris was returned to his rightful spot in November 2012.

;Tryon International Equestrian Center (TIEC)
In June 2014, the $100 million TIEC and Resort opened to host numerous multi-day, international-level equestrian competitions across several disciplines in collaboration with the Tryon Riding and Hunt Club. Located outside Tryon in nearby Mill Spring, the 1400-acre equestrian facility features up to 10 riding arenas (including one with stadium seating for 6,000), 1,000 permanent stalls, elevated and shaded viewing decks, and a large covered riding facility.

In addition, the Tryon Sports Complex on site includes a health club, game room, kids&#x27; camp, sports bar, children&#x27;s playground, tennis courts, mountain bike park, climbing walls, basketball court, and a large pool. A 150-room hotel overlooks the equestrian center. The TIEC hosted the 2018 World Equestrian Games. It was at these games that the horse Barack Obama died.

;Foothills Equestrian Nature Center
The Foothills Equestrian Nature Center (FENCE) is a nature preserve with trails established for hiking, horseback riding, and bird-watching. The center, which also includes picnic areas and a pond, hosts equestrian events and live concerts.
===Library===
The Lanier Library Association is named for poet Sidney Lanier. He was living in &quot;the Wilcox house&quot; on Highway 108 in Lynn, three miles (5 km) north of Tryon. He died there on September 7, 1881, and it has since been known as the &quot;Lanier House&quot;.

In 1889 five women from Tryon developed the idea for a library to provide &quot;intellectual and cultural stimulation for the community&quot;; they opened library membership to local women. Two volumes of Sidney Lanier&#x27;s poems, a gift from his wife Mary, were the first books for the library. Initially the books of the library were located at several places in town before the Lanier Library was constructed in 1905; it has been expanded over the years. In 1930 the library established an endowment fund to support its operations. It extended library membership to men. The Lanier Library Association, Inc., previously called the Lanier club, was organized to provide library services and related cultural programs to the community. Lanier Library remains a membership library supported solely by membership dues, endowments and donations. It is one of a few membership libraries in the country.

===Recreation===
The area is known for its scenic drives featuring well-kept horse farms, hardwood forests, and Carolina foothills overwhelmed by kudzu.

<text>Asheboro is a city in and the county seat of Randolph County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 27,156 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Greensboro-High Point Metropolitan Area of the Piedmont Triad and is home of the state-owned North Carolina Zoo.

==History==
Asheboro was named after Samuel Ashe, the ninth governor of North Carolina (1795–1798), and became the county seat of Randolph County in 1796. It was a small village in the 1800s, with a population of less than 200 through the Civil War; its main function was housing the county courthouse, and the town was most active when court was in session. Asheboro&#x27;s population only began to grow significantly following its connection to railroads: the High Point, Randleman, Asheboro and Southern Railroad first served the city in 1889, followed by the Montgomery Railroad in 1896.

Asheboro emerged as a textile production center in the 20th century with the opening of the Acme Hosiery Mills in 1909. After World War II, the city&#x27;s manufacturing sector grew to include batteries, wires and food products. The city&#x27;s main tourist attraction, the North Carolina Zoo, opened in 1974.

Asheboro suffered from an economic downturn in the 2000s due to a decline in its traditional manufacturing industries amid increasing competition from overseas; the national news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; described it as a &quot;dying town&quot; in 2012. 

In recent years, Asheboro has flourished into a vibrant city. North Carolina&#x27;s largest economic developments are occurring in Asheboro, and future job growth is strong.

Housing rehabilitation projects are ensuring safer, more attractive housing for residents.

In 2015, Sunset Avenue in Downtown Asheboro was named a Great Main Street by the North Carolina Chapter of the American Planning Association. 

In 2016, Asheboro received the All-America City Award, a prestigious award that honors communities developing innovative solutions to pressing problems. Asheboro received the award for its efforts to &quot;ensure that all our children are healthy and successful in school and life.&quot;

<text>Liberty is a town in Randolph County, North Carolina, United States.

==History==
Originally named Liberty Oak, the town was founded in 1809 near the plantation of John Leak. The first church within the town was the Liberty Christian Church (now the United Church of Christ) founded on October 11, 1884. The town&#x27;s first school, the Liberty Academy, was founded on May 6, 1885, as a charter school, and helped to foster the town&#x27;s early reputation as a place of higher learning. Liberty is home to the mother church of the Southern Baptist denomination (Sandy Creek Baptist Church).

The Liberty Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000, largely due to the efforts of Mrs. Francine Swaim, a local writer, teacher, and historian.

==Geography==
Liberty is drained by the Rocky River on the south and southwest and its tributary North Rocky River Prong on the northeast. Sandy Creek, a tributary of the Deep River, drains the town on the west and northwest.

==Events and landmarks==
Liberty is also home to the famous the Liberty Antiques Festival. Also, the Liberty Showcase has had many distinguished Nashville recording stars such as Ronnie McDowell, Lorrie Morgan, Gene Watson, Exile, and many more. The movies &quot;Killers Three&quot; (1968) and &quot;Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice&quot; (1993) were filmed in Liberty and the surrounding areas.

One of Liberty&#x27;s most noticeable landmarks is the Patterson House Museum, near the town hall; it was originally constructed in 1885 by Dr. Armstead Jackson Patterson as a retirement home for his parents. Other local landmarks are the historical Liberty train station (which is not open to the public), and the Vance York house.

<text>Seagrove is a town in Randolph County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 285 at the 2019 census. It was named after a railroad official when the area was connected by rail. In 2020, the center of population of North Carolina was located east of Seagrove.

In this usage, the name &quot;Seagrove&quot; not only refers to the town proper, but also includes several other communities that are part of the pottery tradition along and near the &quot;North Carolina Pottery Highway&quot; (NC 705). Over 100 potteries are located in Seagrove and the neighboring towns of Robbins and Star. This also includes the unincorporated communities of Erect, Happy Hollow, Westmoore and Whynot. Seagrove is also home to the North Carolina Pottery Center, which was established on November 7, 1998, and has since received visitors from across the continent and around the world.

==History==
Seagrove was named for Edwin G. Seagraves, a railroad official who was responsible for routing a railroad through the area. According to local sources, after a unanimous decision to name the station after Seagraves, the town name resulted from a sign painter running out of space and simply dropping the &#x27;s&#x27; from the end of the name. Also, the painter misspelled Seagraves as Seagrove. The railroad served Seagrove until December 31, 1951. The old train depot later was adapted as a pottery museum.

===Plank Road===

Construction of Plank Road began in 1849. Plank Road extended and was made of planks long, wide, and thick. The road carried horseback riders, wagons, and stagecoaches. A toll of one cent per mile (1.6 km) was charged for a wagon and four horses. Toll revenues declined after construction of the railroad, and by 1862 much of Plank Road was abandoned.

Parts of North Carolina Highway 705 follow the Plank Road route.

===Seagrove School===
A school funded by members of the community was established on April 3, 1911. The school moved to a new site in 1918 and again in 1926. The school burned on March 24, 1934, and was subsequently rebuilt. The small Seagrove school accepted students from elementary to high school until the fall of 1970.

In 1970 high school students were reassigned to the new Southwestern Randolph High School. In the fall of 1990, Seagrove students in the 6th through 8th grades began attending Southwestern Randolph Middle School. Today, the building is known as Seagrove Elementary School and serves students only from Kindergarten until the 5th grade.

===Pottery===

Seagrove&#x27;s pottery tradition dates back to the 18th century before the American Revolution. Many of the first Seagrove potters were Scots-Irish immigrants. They primarily produced functional, glazed earthenware. Due to the high quality of the local clay and transportation access for traders, Seagrove became known for its pottery.

The popularity of Seagrove pottery fell off during the Industrial Revolution and the advent of modern food preparation. For a time whisky jugs were a successful source of income, but the beverage was outlawed. The potteries continued their decline in the early 20th century.

In 1915, Jacques and Juliana Busbee of Raleigh made an effort to revive the industry. Over several decades, the Busbees hired Seagrove potters JH Owen, Charlie Teague,  and Ben Owen to make signature wares under the name Jugtown Pottery to sell in the Village Shop, which they opened in Greenwich Village, NYC, and later from the Jugtown shop in Seagrove.
Around 1920, a new market developed as the pottery became popular with tourists driving past on their way to Pinehurst, Southern Pines, or Florida buying inexpensive souvenirs. The new tourist industry marked a general change from utilitarian pottery to more decorative ware. After another decline from the 1950s through 1970s due to the road being replaced with the Interstate, a renewed interest in traditional pottery developed. In 1982 a group of local potters founded the North Carolina Museum of Traditional Pottery and organized the Seagrove Pottery Festival, an annual event held each year the weekend before Thanksgiving in the old bean cannery.

The Cole, Auman, Owen, Teague, and Albright families are eighth- and ninth-generation potters in Seagrove who continue this tradition.

Some of the oldest, historic pottery locations still in operation include the &quot;Original&quot; Owens Pottery founded in 1895 and Jugtown Pottery founded in 1921. Jugtown Pottery was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.

===Pinto Beans===
Seagrove has a tradition in food products, and was home for many years to Luck&#x27;s Incorporated, founded in the 1950s as Mountain View Cannery in the 1950s by Ivey B. Luck, Alfred Spencer &amp; H. Clay Presnell. When Spencer and Presnell sold out to Luck, the establishment became known as Luck&#x27;s. Luck&#x27;s specialized in pinto beans and other canned vegetables and food products, and employed many Seagrove families. Bought out by American Home Products and then later by Conagra Foods and Arizona Canning Company, the Luck&#x27;s plant closed in 2002. Currently, the plant is being used as the towns police station as well as being used for the &quot;Celebration of Seagrove Potters&quot; every November, and other local events.

The family lived on a farm in Southampton, Pennsylvania, Bucks County, and in the late summer of 1758, August 22, Jacob and his wife, Elizabeth Quarter departed for North Carolina, taking the Great Wagon Road into Orange County, now Chatham County and Randolph County, North Carolina. Jacob and his wife raised ten children, eight born in Germany. Their land appears to be in present day Chatham County near the border with Randolph County, east/northeast of the town of Staley, along the Rocky River (1780 Deed of sale).

<text>Dobbins Heights is a town in Richmond County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 866 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

== History ==
Dobbins Heights was originally known as North Yard. It began as a largely black community in an unincorporated part of Richmond County near the city of Hamlet, with fewer than 1,000 residents. A black school, the Pee Dee Institute, was built in North Yard in 1908. Through the 1960s, many of the homes in the community were rented, and existed in poor condition with outdoor plumbing. Many streets remained unpaved through the 1980s. Due to its unincorporated status, North Yard&#x27;s residents received fewer government services than other municipal residents and lacked direct political representation. They usually paid taxes directly to Richmond County government, though occasionally levies were paid to Hamlet. There was little cohesive community identity in the area; collective social life, such as it existed, was centered around several churches.
In the mid-1960s, a local minister founded the North Yard Improvement Association, which raised money to install streetlights along some of the main roads in the community. From 1971 to 1972 United States Army engineers built a recreational area in the community. Lack of adequate coverage from neighboring fire departments led the community to create a volunteer fire department in 1974. Two years later residents appealed for the city of Hamlet to annex the community, but the municipal government rejected the proposal, citing the economically depressed nature of the area. Some locals suspected their lack of success was due to racism. Following the failure of the annexation request, residents began pushing for North Yard to be incorporated in its own right, and began calling the community Dobbins Heights in homage to Jim Dobbins, a minister who had owned a significant amount of the area&#x27;s land in the 1930s. In 1983 Representative Hugh Lee of Rockingham introduced a bill in the North Carolina General Assembly to authorize a local referendum to decide on incorporation. On May 8, 1984, the referendum was held which concluded narrowly in favor of incorporation, leading to the creation of the town of Dobbins Heights. A black mayor and all-black city council were elected, and the officials successfully secured state and federal grants to improve local infrastructure, including the rehabilitation of streets and parks and equipment acquisitions for the fire department.

<text>Ellerbe is a town in Richmond County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 1,054 at the 2010 census.

==History==
In the 1700s Scottish settlers held a fair every May and November in the present location of Ellerbe, leading locals to dub the place &quot;the Fair Grounds&quot;. W. T. Ellerbe later developed a spa nearby called Ellerbe Springs, and thereafter the community took its name. A railroad was built to Ellerbe in 1910 and a depot was constructed. The town was incorporated the following year. At the time it only had a population of 50. By 1923 it had grown to a population of over 500, with several mills, two banks, three churches, a telephone exchange, and a hotel. The rail line remained in service until 1954, and the depot burnt down several years later.

<text>The Macintosh Classic is a personal computer designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer from October 1990 to September 1992. It was the first Macintosh to sell for less than US$1,000.

Production of the Classic was prompted by the success of the original Macintosh 128K, then the Macintosh Plus, and finally the Macintosh SE. The system specifications of the Classic are very similar to those of its predecessors, with the same monochrome CRT display, 512 × 342pixel resolution, and 4megabyte (MB) memory limit of the older Macintosh computers. Apple&#x27;s decision to not update the Classic with newer technology such as a newer CPU, higher RAM capacity or color display resulted in criticism from reviewers, with &quot;Macworld&quot; describing it as having &quot;nothing to gloat about beyond its low price&quot; and &quot;unexceptional&quot;. However, it ensured compatibility with the Mac&#x27;s by-then healthy software base, as well as enabled it to sell for the lower price, as planned. The Classic also featured several improvements over the aging Macintosh Plus, which it replaced as Apple&#x27;s low-end Mac computer. It is up to 25percent faster than the Plus and included an Apple SuperDrive floppy disk drive as standard. Unlike the Macintosh SE/30 and other compact Macs before it, the Classic did not have an internal Processor Direct Slot, making it the first non-expandable desktop Macintosh since the Macintosh Plus. Instead, it had a memory expansion slot.

The Classic is an adaptation of Jerry Manock&#x27;s and Terry Oyama&#x27;s 1984 Macintosh 128K industrial design, as had been the earlier Macintosh SE. Apple released two versions. The price and the availability of education software led to the Classic&#x27;s popularity in education. It was sold alongside the more powerful Macintosh Classic II in 1991 until its discontinuation the next year.

==History==

===Development===
After Apple&#x27;s co-founder Steve Jobs left Apple in 1985, product development was handed to Jean-Louis Gassée, formerly the manager of Apple France. Gassée consistently pushed the Apple product line in two directions, towards more &quot;openness&quot; in terms of expandability and interoperability, and towards higher price. Gassée long argued that Apple should not aim for the low end of the computer market, where profits were thin, but instead concentrate on the high end and higher profit margins. He illustrated the concept using a graph showing the price-performance ratio of computers with low-power, low-cost machines in the lower left and high-power high-cost machines in the upper right. The &quot;high-right&quot; goal became a mantra among the upper management, who said &quot;fifty-five or die&quot;, referring to Gassée&#x27;s goal of a 55 percent profit margin.

The high-right policy led to a series of machines with ever-increasing prices. The original Macintosh plans called for a system around $1,000, but by the time it had morphed from Jef Raskin&#x27;s original vision of an easy-to-use machine for composing text documents to Jobs&#x27;s concept incorporating ideas gleaned during a trip to Xerox PARC, the Mac&#x27;s list price had ballooned to $2,495.

With the &quot;low-left&quot; of the market it had abandoned years earlier booming with Turbo XTs, and being ignored on the high end for UNIX workstations from the likes of Sun Microsystems and SGI, Apple&#x27;s fortunes of the 1980s quickly reversed. The Christmas season of 1989 drove this point home, with the first decrease in sales in years, and an accompanying 20 percent drop in Apple&#x27;s stock price for the quarter.

In January 1990, Gassée resigned and his authority over product development was divided among several successors. Many Apple engineers had long been pressing for lower-cost options in order to build market share and increase demand across the entire price spectrum. With Gassée out, a rush started to quickly introduce a series of low-cost machines. Three market points were identified: a very low-cost machine with a target price of $1,000, a low-cost machine with color graphics, and a more upscale color machine for small business use. In time, these would develop as the Classic, Macintosh LC, and Macintosh IIsi, respectively.

===Release===
&quot;MacWEEK&quot; magazine reported on July 10, 1990, that Apple had paid to Modular Computer Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz AG, for the right to use the &quot;Classic&quot; name as part of a five-year contract. Apple did not renew the contract when it ended. &quot;MacWEEK&quot; speculated the Macintosh Classic would use the same Motorola 68000 microprocessor and display as its predecessors and that the Classic would be priced from .

On October 15, 1990, John Sculley (then Apple CEO) introduced the Classic at a press conference, announcing that pricing would start at and saying, &quot;To reach new customers, we didn&#x27;t just lower the prices of our existing products. We redesigned these computers from the ground up with the features customers have told us they value most.&quot; Apple&#x27;s new pricing strategy caused concern among investors, who thought it would reduce profit margins. Brodie Keast, an Apple product marketing manager, said, &quot;We are prepared to do whatever it takes to reach more people with Macintosh[...] The plan is to get as aggressive on price as we need to be.&quot; After the release of the Classic, Apple&#x27;s share price closed at per share, down from October 12, 1990, and far below its previous 12-month high of .

The Classic was released in Europe and Japan concurrently with the United States release. In Japan, the Classic retailed for (), more than in the US but matching the price of the Toshiba Dynabook laptop computer.

After spending marketing the Classic to first-time buyers, Apple had difficulty meeting the high demand. Apple doubled its manufacturing space in 1990 by expanding its Singapore and Cork, Ireland factories, where the Classic was assembled. Air freight, rather than sea shipping, was used to speed delivery. The shortage caused concern among dealers, who blamed Apple&#x27;s poor business planning.

Macintosh Classics and LCs had been given to Scholastic Software 12 weeks before they were officially announced, and Scholastic planned to release 16 new Macintosh products in 1991. Peter Kelman, Scholastic&#x27;s publisher, predicted that the Macintosh would become &quot;the school machine of the nineties.&quot; The Classic was sold to schools for . This, and the availability of educational software, led to the Classic&#x27;s popularity in the education sector.

==Features==
The low-end model was sold with 1 MB of memory, a 1.44 MB floppy drive, no hard disk, and included a keyboard for $999. The $1,500 model had 2 MB of memory and a 40 MB hard disk. The Classic features several improvements over the Macintosh Plus, which it replaced as Apple&#x27;s low-end Mac computer: it is up to 25 percent faster than the Plus, about as fast as the SE, and includes an Apple SuperDrive 3.5&quot; floppy disk drive as standard. The SuperDrive can read and write to Macintosh, MS-DOS, OS/2, and ProDOS disks. The Classic also has a memory expansion slot (up to 4 MB).

The Classic uses the System 6.0.7 operating system with support for all versions up to System 7.5.5. A hidden Hierarchical File System (HFS) disk volume contained in the read-only memory (ROM) includes System 6.0.3. The Mac Classic can be booted into System 6.0.3 by holding down the keys during boot.

Some dealers included a software bundle called Smartbundle with the Classic. Also sold separately for $349, this includes T/Maker&#x27;s WriteNow word processor, Ashton-Tate&#x27;s Full Impact spreadsheet program, RecordHolderPlus database, and Silicon Beach Software&#x27;s SuperPaint 2.0 paint and draw program.

==Design==

The Macintosh Classic is the final adaptation of Jerry Manock&#x27;s and Terry Oyama&#x27;s Macintosh 128K industrial design, bringing back some elements of the original while retaining little of the Snow White design language used in the Macintosh SE&#x27;s design. The only remnant of the SE is the stripe across the front panel (bezel) for the floppy drive; the distinctive front bezel lines of the SE were not used on the Classic, and the vertical lines around its base are replaced by four horizontal vent lines, more reminiscent of the original design. Also, the curve of the front bezel was increased to the same radial curve as on the front of both the Macintosh LC and Macintosh IIsi. The screen brightness dial on this bezel was also removed in favor of a software control. This broad, curved front bezel became a signature of Apple product design for much of the 1990s.

The logic board, the central circuit board of the computer, is based on the Macintosh SE design. Its size, however, was reduced using surface-mount technology to 9 × 5 inches (23 × 13 cm), half the size of the SE board. This redesign, and the absence of expansion slots, kept manufacturing costs low. This lack of expansion abilities, along with the small screen size and Macintosh&#x27;s popularity in desktop publishing, led to such oddities as video displays that connected through the SCSI port by users seeking to connect a larger full- or dual-page display to their Mac. The Classic design was used once more in 1991 for the Classic II, which succeeded the Classic.

==Reception==
Some reviewers of the Macintosh Classic focused on the processor performance and lack of expansion slots. Liza Schafer of &quot;Home Office Computing&quot; praised the Classic&#x27;s ease of use and price, but criticized the display because a full US letter page () would not fit at full size, and warned those who required high-end graphics and desktop publishing capabilities against buying the Classic. Schafer concluded: &quot;The Classic&#x27;s value is more impressive than its performance, but its performance will get you working on that novel, database, or spreadsheet.&quot; &quot;PC Week&quot; criticized the lack of a faster processor, stating, &quot;The 7.8MHz speed is adequate for text applications and limited graphics work, but it is not suitable for power users. As such, the Classic is appropriate as a home computer or for limited computing on the road.&quot; Similarly, &quot;PC User&quot;&#x27;s review concluded, &quot;The slow processor and lack of expansion slots on the Macintosh Classic offset the low prices&quot;. &quot;MacWEEK&quot; described it as a &quot;fine, inexpensive replacement for the Macintosh Plus that best embodies the original Macintosh vision six and a half years later&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; was more skeptical, doubting that consumers would purchase a black-and-white computer with no hard drive that was only slightly faster than the Mac Plus.

In the February 1991 edition of &quot;Electronic Learning&quot;, Robert McCarthy wrote: &quot;Teachers, educational administrators, and software developers are enthusiastic about the new, lower-cost Apple Macintosh computers&quot;. Steve Taffe, manager of instructional strategy at MECC, a developer and publisher of educational software, explained his excitement about the Classic: &quot;[it] is terrific – both because it&#x27;s a Mac and because of that low price. Everyone can now afford a Macintosh.&quot; Scholastic, an educational software developer, was also confident of Apple&#x27;s ability to compete with MS-DOS machines, stating: &quot;They are just as cost-effective and as powerful as MS-DOS computers, but the Apples will have a superior comfort level.&quot; Sue Talley, Apple&#x27;s manager of strategic planning in education, said of the Classic: &quot;we see it going into applications where you need a fair number of powerful stations, but where color is not a big issue.&quot; Talley mentioned that it was most suited for writing labs and other basic productivity uses. Many schools decided not to buy the Macintosh Classic because of the lack of a color monitor, an option that the higher-priced Macintosh LC had. The popular Apple IIe Card also increased the LC&#x27;s appeal to schools. Although the Classic was more popular at first, by May 1992 the LC (560,000 sold) was outselling the Classic (1.2 million sold).

<text>Hamlet is a city in Richmond County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 6,042 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

The area in Richmond County which presently includes Hamlet was originally known as Sandhills. The Wilmington, Charlotte &amp; Rutherford Railroad was extended through the area in 1866. The first house was constructed there in 1869. In 1872 the land was purchased by John Shortridge, an English immigrant who intended on building a textile mill along a creek. He renamed the locale Hamlet the following year, supposedly in homage to hamlets in the British Isles. He planted a sycamore tree to celebrate the occasion, which stood until 1946. 

A post office was established in 1876, and that year Shortridge sold a parcel of land to Raleigh and Augusta Air Line Railroad, which completed its own line through Hamlet by the following year. Railway shops were built in 1894 and the town was formally incorporated on February 9, 1897. Seaboard Air Line Railroad decided to establish its regional headquarters there, and Hamlet rapidly grew thereafter. By 1910, the locale hosted two five and dimes, five dry goods stores, and a Coca-Cola bottling plant. From a population of 639 in 1900, the town grew to encompass more than 4,000 residents in 1930. The Hamlet Hospital—the first such facility in the county—was opened in 1915, and by 1940 it had expanded to a new facility and was the largest in the region.

Hamlet&#x27;s early growth was sustained by Seaboard, which heavily invested in facilities within the town. By the end of World War I, 30 trains passed through Hamlet daily, and the corporation decided to construct a maintenance shop, a roundhouse, and a shipping yard. After World War II, an $11 million classification yard, the first one in the Southeastern United States, was established about one mile north of town, opening in 1954. The Seaboard Line carried mostly freight traffic, but also brought tourists through Hamlet on the &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot;, the &quot;Boll Weevil&quot;, and the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;. Before sleeping cars became predominant, many rail passengers would stop in Hamlet and board at the Terminal Hotel or Seaboard Hotel. They provided traffic to the businesses on Main Street, which included several banks, a jewelry store, shoe shop, drug store, hardware store, opera house, and a bowling alley. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries Hamlet was visited by prominent persons including Booker T. Washington, William Jennings Bryan, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Buffalo Bill, Jenny Lind, and Enrico Caruso. Seaboard provided thousands of mostly white men with well-paying, secure employment as conductors, engineers, and brakemen. Workers received sick pay, pension plans, and wages negotiated by national unions. As a result, Hamlet developed a large middle class, unlike the nearby city of Rockingham, which was home to many poorer textile mill workers.

Hamlet&#x27;s economic situation came under strain beginning in the 1960s, as the railroad faced increasing competition from growing road networks, trucking, and air travel. Seaboard acquired smaller competitors and consolidated its operations, moving workers out of Hamlet. It also froze wages, terminated some positions, and reduced passenger services, diminishing the number of outside visitors to the town. Seaboard became CSX Transportation in 1986. A K-Mart and Walmart were built in Rockingham in the 1970s, providing that municipality with tax revenue and pulling Hamlet&#x27;s customers away from their own town. Seaboard laid off hundreds of workers while more national business chains with cheaper prices moved into the region, driving down wages and further reducing the viability of Hamlet&#x27;s traditional businesses along Main Street. Coca-Cola closed its bottling plant in 1973. Racially-charged riots broke out in June 1975 after a Hamlet police officer discharged his gun during an altercation with a black woman. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, many businesses along Main Street and Hamlet Avenue were vacant, and the Terminal Hotel had become a flophouse. Seaboard&#x27;s facilities employed less than 600 people, and the Hamlet Depot was only serviced by Amtrak passenger trains twice a day and visited occasionally by railfans. National declines in manufacturing, including textiles, also had a wider stagnating effect on Richmond County.
Between 1980 and 1990, Hamlet annexed several hundred acres of surrounding territory and gained 1,200 new residents. In 1982 Richmond Community College sponsored the creation of the Seaboard Festival, a community gathering including local vendors, running events, and music, designed to celebrate Hamlet&#x27;s historical connections to the railroad. A civic board was chartered to put on the event annually. In 1990 portions of the film &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot; were filmed on Main Street, and in June the city was bestowed with the All-America City Award by the National Civic League, which praised the city&#x27;s library expansion, efforts to preserve the hospital, and the hosting of the Seaboard Festival.

On September 3, 1991, an industrial fire destroyed the Imperial Food Products plant in Hamlet. Many exits at the plant were locked in violation of fire codes. The fire injured 54 and killed 25 (24 workers and 1 visiting delivery driver). Emmett J. Roe, the plant owner, was sentenced to 19 years in prison for the involuntary manslaughter. State authorities imposed a record fine upon the company for the violations and the incident brought negative national attention to the town. The town spent a total of $13 million to clean up plant site and on related efforts aimed at economic revitalization which attempted to highlight Hamlet&#x27;s historic connections to the railroad industry with particular efforts focused on renovating the Hamlet Depot.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (1.75%) is water. The Works Progress Administration built an earthen dam in the city in the 1930s, leading to the creation of a 50-acre shallow body of water, the Hamlet City Lake.

==Education==
Hamlet operated its own school system until 1968, when it was absorbed by the Richmond County School System. The town is home to the Fairview Heights Elementary School, Monroe Avenue Elementary School, Hamlet Middle School, and Richmond County Ninth Grade Academy. High school students are served by the Richmond Senior High School, located west of the city. The Richmond Community College, which serves Richmond and Scotland counties, was established in Hamlet in 1964. It maintains a 160-acre campus adjacent to U.S. Route 74 and offers associate degrees.

==Additional information==
Hamlet is at the junction of three major CSX rail lines, one running north towards Raleigh, North Carolina, as well as south towards Savannah, Georgia, and the second running east towards Wilmington, North Carolina, and west towards Bostic, North Carolina. At Monroe, North Carolina, the line splits northwest to Charlotte and Bostic, and one continues west to Atlanta, Georgia, originally on to Birmingham, Alabama; however, tracks were removed in 1987. The third line splits off from the second just east of Hamlet and continues towards Charleston, South Carolina. It has been cited as the prime spot in North Carolina for train watchers.
The National Railroad Museum and Hall of Fame is also located in Hamlet.

Hamlet was the largest city in Richmond County at one time, but it has been surpassed by neighboring Rockingham. In the early part of the 20th century, more than 30 trains stopped in Hamlet daily, en route to New York City, New Orleans, Suffolk and cities in Florida. Known as &quot;The Hub of the Seaboard,&quot; Hamlet had seven hotels and numerous boarding houses and restaurants catering to transferring rail passengers. &quot;Hamlet was like the Charlotte airport is today,&quot; said Miranda Chavis, manager of the railroad museum.

In addition to the Hamlet Passenger Station, the Main Street Commercial Historic District is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Rockingham is a city in Richmond County, North Carolina, United States, named after the Marquess of Rockingham. The population was 9,243 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Richmond County.

Downtown Rockingham is currently being revitalized as a part of a ten-year plan named &quot;Shaping Our Future: 2023&quot;. The city is currently experiencing an economic boom, with new businesses opening in the downtown area.

==History==
The city was named for Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham, British Prime Minister from 1765 to 1766 and again in 1782. Rockingham&#x27;s administration was dominated by the issue of the Thirteen Colonies. Rockingham wanted to repeal the Stamp Act 1765 and won a Commons vote in 1766 on the repeal resolution by 275 to 167. As a result, he was a popular figure among British colonists in America (who would later become known simply as &quot;Americans&quot;). People in North Carolina were still sympathetic toward him in the years following the United States gaining independence.

During the early 19th century, numerous families from here migrated to Middle Tennessee, settling in what is now Nolensville. They quickly established their new community.

In 1950, the town fielded a professional minor league baseball team in the Class D Tobacco State League, the Rockingham Eagles. The club won the playoff title in their only season before disbanding with the entire league.

Rockingham has a number of historic buildings which have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since the late 1970s: the Bank of Pee Dee Building, Covington Plantation House, Alfred Dockery House, Hannah Pickett Mill No. 1, Manufacturers Building, Richmond County Courthouse, Roberdel Mill No. 1 Company Store, Rockingham Historic District, U.S. Post Office and Federal Building, and H. C. Watson House.

<text>Barker Ten Mile is a census-designated place (CDP) in Robeson County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 937 at the 2020 census. 

==History==
According to local author Christopher Musselwhite, the name &quot;Barker Ten Mile&quot; comes from the location of the community, near Barker United Methodist Church and Ten Mile Swamp, a local waterway.

The land surrounding Barker Ten Mile includes multiple areas of local historic significance, the first being &quot;The Meadows,&quot; which is the familial hunting grounds and horse pastures of the Goode, French, McMillan, Shepherd and Godwin families, all of whom were prominent landholders, tobacco farmers and community members. Margaret McLean, (née French) the wife of Angus Wilton Mclean, grew up in Barker Ten Mile. The collection of family land holdings originally stretched from what is now Meadowbrook Cemetery and north to Bee Gee Road and Meadow Road. From east to west, the property extended along the boundaries of Meadow Road and traversed I-95 near the current location of Robeson County Community College. Berry Godwin French, Margaret French McLean&#x27;s father, was often referred to by the nickname &quot;Bee Gee&quot; and as such Bee Gee Road, which bisected his land, was named after him. Additionally, Barker Ten Mile is within the drainage area and immediately contains portions of Ten Mile Swamp and Saddle Tree Swamp, both of which are of cultural significance to the Lumbee. The Locklear family (Lumbee) and the Goodes (Barker Ten Mile Scot&#x27;s) were known to have hunted quail frequently together at the meadow and is reflective generally of the racial attitudes of the Barker Ten Mile Scots and Saddle Tree/Barker Ten Mile Lumbee.

<text>Fairmont is a town in Robeson County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 2,191 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Fairmont was originally known as Ashpole in homage to the nearby Ashpole Swamp. It was incorporated as Union City in 1899, but the name was changed back to Ashpole in 1901. Six years later the name was changed to Fairmont.
The first settlers to this area received land grants from the Lords Proprietors and worked in the logging and naval stores industries producing lumber, turpentine and pitch for ships. The Bufort County Lumber Company opened in the northern section of town in the late 1890s employing 300 men and becoming one of the largest lumber companies in the south. By the late 19th century, a thriving tobacco market had been established as well. The railroads later followed to rapidly move these goods. By the early 20th century, tobacco became king, and by the late 1940s, Fairmont was considered the &quot;Biggest Little Tobacco Market In the World.&quot; In 1951 Fairmont sold twice as much tobacco as was grown in Robeson County. As health concerns have affected the sales of tobacco, many local farmers have turned to other cash crops, mainly corn, soybeans and wheat. The Border Belt Farmers Museum was established in 1989 by converting an unused former railroad depot into a museum filled with farming, tobacco related, and historical memorabilia. It is open five days a week (M, W, F-11:00-3:00 &amp; T, TH 9-12:00 &amp; 1:00-3:00). The town has recently started promoting itself as &quot;the shortest route to the S.C. beaches&quot; by encouraging motorists traveling south on Interstate 95 to take exit 10. The advertising campaign, utilizing a very prominent billboard on the interstate, has resulted in a higher traffic flow and increased commercial traffic to the community.

Scenes from the movie &quot;Arthur Newman&quot; were filmed here.

<text>Lumberton is a city in Robeson County, North Carolina, United States. As of 2020, its population was 19,025. It is the county seat of Robeson County.

Located in southern North Carolina&#x27;s Inner Banks region, Lumberton is located on the Lumber River. It was founded in 1787 by John Willis, an officer in the American Revolution. This was developed as a shipping point for lumber used by the Navy, and logs were guided downriver to Georgetown, South Carolina. Most of the town&#x27;s growth took place after World War II.

David Lynch&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; was set in Lumberton; however filming took place in Wilmington.

==History==
Robeson County, North Carolina, was formed in 1787. General John Willis, owner of the Red Banks plantation, lobbied to have the county&#x27;s new seat of government located on his land. The site of Lumberton was chosen due to its central location in the county, proximity to a reliable ford of the Lumber River, and as it was where several roads intersected. Willis turned over 170 acres, which were surveyed and disbursed in a lottery held under the auspices of the county court on August 14, 1787. As the site was heavily forested, trees were felled to make way for a courthouse, business and residential lots, streets, a commons, and a public square. The first courthouse was a wooden residence sold by Willis to the county and moved into place after the land was clear. Lumberton was formally created by an act of the North Carolina General Assembly on November 3, 1788, which granted the town a charter and the power to levy taxes. The community was named in homage to the Lumber River.

Aside from the courthouse, the first buildings in Lumberton were a handful of brick structures built near the river, which included a hotel, stores, and warehouses, which were stocked by goods sent up the river from Georgetown, South Carolina. The community&#x27;s first school was established by Willis in 1791. The town had a post office by 1796. It was formally incorporated in 1852 and granted a municipal government with a mayor and a board of commissioners. The town was connected by rail with Wilmington in 1860, which reduced its reliance on river trade from Georgetown. Much of the business district was burnt down in a fire in 1870 and another in 1876.
For four seasons, 1947–50, Lumberton fielded a professional minor-league baseball team in the Tobacco State League. Affiliated with the Chicago Cubs, the team was known as the Lumberton Cubs in 1947 and &#x27;48, and the Lumberton Auctioneers in 1949 and &#x27;50.

In 1970, Lumberton was named an All-America City, presented by the National Civic League. Many businesses left the downtown in the mid-1970s. A 1988 hostage crisis at the offices of &quot;The Robesonian&quot; and the 1993 murder of James R. Jordan Sr. nearby generated a negative national image for the city. In 1995, the city won the All-America City award a second time.

In 2016, Robeson County was impacted by Hurricane Matthew, leading to record flooding in Lumberton. In 2018, the county was struck by Hurricane Florence, which broke the flooding record. As a result of extensive damage to homes, entire streets in south and west Lumberton were left abandoned.

<text>John Michael Hawthorn (10 April 1929 – 22 January 1959) was a British racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Hawthorn won the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Ferrari, and won three Grands Prix across seven seasons. In endurance racing, Hawthorn won both the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1955 with Jaguar.

In 1958, Hawthorn became the first of 10 British Formula One World Champions, beating Stirling Moss to the title by one point. He announced his retirement upon his triumph, having been profoundly affected by the death of his teammate and friend Peter Collins two months earlier during the . Three months after retiring, Hawthorn died in a road accident in Guildford, driving his Jaguar 3.4 Litre. The Hawthorn Memorial Trophy was established in his honour by the RAC in 1959, being awarded to the most successful British, or Commonwealth, driver in Formula One each year.

==Early life==
Mike Hawthorn was born in Mexborough, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Leslie and Winifred (née Symonds) Hawthorn, and educated at Ardingly College, West Sussex, followed by studies at Chelsea technical college and an apprenticeship with a commercial vehicle manufacturer. His father owned the Tourist Trophy Garage in Farnham, franchised to supply and service several high performance brands, including Jaguar and Ferrari. His father raced motorcycles and supported his son&#x27;s racing career; when he died in a road accident in 1954, Mike Hawthorn inherited the business.

==Racing career==
Mike Hawthorn made his competition debut on 2 September 1950 in his 1934 Riley Ulster Imp, KV 9475, winning the 1,100 cc sports car class at the Brighton Speed Trials. In 1951, driving a -litre T.T. Riley, he entered the &quot;Motor Sport&quot; Brooklands Memorial Trophy, a season-long contest run at Goodwood, winning it by one point. He also won the Ulster Trophy Handicap at Dundrod and the Leinster Trophy at Wicklow that year.

===1952===
By 1952, Hawthorn had switched to single-seaters and during that season won his first race in a Formula Two Cooper-Bristol T20 at Goodwood. Further successes followed which brought him to the attention of Enzo Ferrari, who offered him a works drive. He made his Formula One debut at the 1952 Grote Prijs van Belgie on the legendary Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, finishing in fourth place. By the end of the season, he had already secured his first podium, with a third place at the RAC British Grand Prix and a brace of fourths driving a Cooper.

===1953===
At Scuderia Ferrari for the 1953 season, Hawthorn immediately showed his worth with victory, at his ninth attempt, in the French Grand Prix at Reims, outmanoeuvring Juan Manuel Fangio in what became dubbed &#x27;the race of the century&#x27; with the top four drivers finishing within five seconds of each other after 60 laps. This and two other podium finishes helped him end the season fourth overall. He also won the BRDC International Trophy and the Ulster Trophy as well as the 24 Heures de Spa Francorchamps with Ferrari teammate Giuseppe Farina.

===1954===
Hawthorn&#x27;s liability for conscription (National Service) was brought up in the House of Commons. In a crash during the Gran Premio di Siracusa Hawthorn suffered serious burns, but finished the year with three seconds and then victory in the season finale in Spain, placing him third in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Following the death of his father, Hawthorn left Ferrari to race for Tony Vandervell&#x27;s Vanwall team, as he needed to spend more time at the family garage he had inherited, but after two races returned to Ferrari.

===1955===
====24 Hours of Le Mans====
In January 1955, Hawthorn joined the Jaguar racing team, replacing Stirling Moss, who had left for Mercedes. Hawthorn won the 1955 les 24 Heures du Mans following what has been described as an inspired drive in which he set a lap record of 4 minutes and 6.6 seconds during a three-hour duel with Fangio in the early stages. However, the race was marred by the worst disaster in motor racing history, a crash which killed 83 spectators and Mercedes driver Pierre Levegh. After overtaking Lance Macklin&#x27;s Healey, Hawthorn suddenly braked in front of him on noticing an order to enter the pits to refuel, causing Macklin to swerve into the path of Levegh&#x27;s Mercedes. After colliding with the Healey, the Mercedes skipped the earthen embankment separating the spectator area from the track, bounced through spectator enclosures, then hit a concrete stairwell parapet head-on. The impact shattered the front end of the car, which then somersaulted high, pitching debris into the spectator area, before landing atop the earthen embankment. The debris, including bonnet, engine, and front axle, which separated from the frame, flew through the crowd.

Eight hours later, while leading the race 1.5 laps ahead of the Jaguar team, the Mercedes team withdrew from the race, ostensibly as a mark of respect for those who had perished in the accident; the Jaguar team was invited to join them but declined. The French press carried photographs of Hawthorn and Ivor Bueb celebrating their win with the customary champagne but treated them with scorn.

The official inquiry into the accident ruled that Hawthorn was not responsible for the crash, and that it was merely a racing incident. The death of so many spectators was blamed on inadequate safety standards for track design. Aside from two layout changes to make the circuit shorter, the track was largely unaltered since the inception of the race in 1923, when top speeds of cars were typically in the region of . By 1955, top speeds for the leading cars were over . That said, the circuit had been resurfaced and widened post-war. The pits and grandstands had been reconstructed, but there were no barriers between the pit lane and the racing line, and only a earthen bank between the track and the spectators. The Grandstand and pit areas were demolished and rebuilt soon after. The death toll led to a ban on motorsports in France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany and other nations, until the tracks could be brought to a higher safety standard. In Switzerland motorsports were banned with exceptions until the ban was lifted in June 2022.

====Dundrod====
Whilst sharing the Jaguar D-Type with Desmond Titterington during the 1955 RAC Tourist Trophy at Dundrod, Hawthorn passed Fangio twice, and set the lap record for the RAC Tourist Trophy on the Dundrod Circuit, only to lose in the final stages when, running on full tanks, he was passed by Stirling Moss when the D Type&#x27;s engine failed on the last lap.

===1956–1957===

Another change of team for 1956 – this time to BRM - was a failure, and Hawthorn&#x27;s only podium came in Argentina where the non-appearance of his BRM allowed him to guest drive a Maserati 250F. However, when it appeared, usually only in British races, the new 2.5 BRM was very fast while it lasted, and Hawthorn held off Fangio, leading the first 25 laps at Silverstone in the British GP. He retired the car before half distance owing to deteriorating handling and brakes. Deeply unhappy with the BRM team&#x27;s management and car preparation, Hawthorn walked out of the team at this point. Hawthorn had left Ferrari because driving for the British Jaguar sports car team was his first priority. He was favoured to win at Le Mans again, but lost ten laps in the pits early in the race, and while the D type repeatedly set fastest laps, the fuel consumption rules meant he could only finish sixth.

Racing the D type in Italy, Hawthorn crashed and suffered very serious burns, his second bad accident of the year, leaving him disillusioned with racing. However, he believed a return to Ferrari could give him the championship in the superior Lancia Ferrari D50. He had put the original Jano version of the car on the front row at its debut in the final F1 race of 1955 at Oulton Park. However, Ferrari&#x27;s modified version of the design for 1957 was slower than Fangio and Collins&#x27;s all-conquering 1956 Lancia Ferrari. The 1957 version, with the polar centred pannier tanks removed, still handled well, but was not the masterpiece Jano designed; it lacked straight line speed and was not competitive by mid 1957, clearly inferior to the new Vanwalls.

Hawthorn rejoined the Ferrari factory team in 1957, and soon became friends with Peter Collins, a fellow Englishman and Ferrari team driver. During the 1957 and 1958 racing seasons, the two Englishmen became engaged in a fierce rivalry with Luigi Musso, another Ferrari driver, for prize money.

===1958 World Champion===
Hawthorn won the Formula One Championship despite achieving only one win, against four by Moss. Hawthorn won the 1958 French Grand Prix at Reims, in which Musso was fatally injured while in second place. Leading easily in the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix at half distance, his 246 engine blew, while at Monza he was a minute ahead of Tony Brooks when his clutch forced him to slow to second place. Hawthorn benefited greatly from the gentlemanliness of Moss, as demonstrated at the 1958 Portuguese Grand Prix at Porto. Hawthorn was disqualified for bump starting his stalled car downhill in the opposite direction, on the way to a second-place finish. Moss interceded on Hawthorn&#x27;s behalf and the decision was ultimately reversed. After a pit stop midway through that race, Hawthorn accelerated back through the field to gain an extra point for fastest lap. Moss had failed to respond, possibly doubting Hawthorn could lap so fast with damaged drum brakes. This extra world championship point plus the second place points contributed to Hawthorn winning the championship with a season total just one more than that of Moss. In the final race, the 1958 Moroccan Grand Prix, Hawthorn drove a conservative tactical race aiming to stay ahead of Moss&#x27;s Vanwall teammates. Brooks&#x27;s car broke while narrowly leading Hawthorn, and Stuart Lewis-Evans in the third Vanwall crashed after a desperate attempt to move through the field and challenge Hawthorn running third; Evans later died of burns. In the last laps, second-placed Phil Hill slowed and waved Hawthorn through to gain enough points to take the Championship; the first ever to be won by an English driver. Hawthorn&#x27;s total of just one win in his title winning season means that Hawthorn currently jointly holds the Formula One record for the fewest number of Grand Prix wins by an eventual drivers&#x27; champion during a title winning season along with Keke Rosberg (who also scored one win in his subsequent 1982 title winning season) 

After winning the title, Hawthorn immediately announced his retirement from Formula One. He began a series of books for children featuring not only the wholly fictional Carlotti but also himself and other drivers of the day (&#x27;Stirling nipped past me at the hairpin&#x27;, and so on). The first, published in 1958, was &quot;Carlotti Joins the Team&quot;, and a second was published in 1959 called &quot;Carlotti Takes the Wheel&quot;. Due to his death, the series did not continue.

Hawthorn was noted for wearing a bow tie when racing; to the French, he became known as &#x27;Le Papillon&#x27; (The Butterfly).

==Rivalry with Luigi Musso==
Fiamma Breschi, Musso&#x27;s girlfriend at the time of his death, revealed the nature of Musso&#x27;s rivalry with Hawthorn and Collins in a television documentary, &quot;The Secret Life of Enzo Ferrari&quot;, many years after the death of Hawthorn. Breschi recalled that the antagonism between Musso and the two English drivers encouraged all three to take more risks: &quot;The Englishmen (Hawthorn and Collins) had an agreement&quot;, she says. &quot;Whichever of them won, they would share the winnings equally. It was the two of them against Luigi, who was not part of the agreement. Strength comes in numbers, and they were united against him. This antagonism was actually favourable rather than damaging to Ferrari. The faster the drivers went, the more likely it was that a Ferrari would win.&quot; Breschi related that Musso was in debt at the time of his death, and the money for winning the 1958 French Grand Prix (traditionally the largest monetary prize of the season), was all-important to him.

After visiting the mortally injured Musso in hospital, Breschi returned to her hotel, where she and the rest of the Ferrari team were informed by the team manager that afternoon that Musso had died. Within thirty days Collins too was dead, and the following January, Hawthorn. Breschi could not suppress a feeling of release: &quot;I had hated them both&quot;, she said, &quot;first because I was aware of certain facts that were not right, and also because when I came out of the hospital and went back to the hotel, I found them in the square outside the hotel, laughing and playing a game of football with an empty beer can. So when they died, too, it was liberating for me. Otherwise I would have had unpleasant feelings towards them forever. This way I could find a sense of peace.&quot;

==Personal life==
After leaving school in the summer of 1946, Hawthorn started serving his apprenticeship with Dennis Bros of Guildford in Surrey. He used his 1939 250cc OHV Triumph to get there each day regularly racing Jack Kinghorn on his Triumph Thunderbird on the infamous A31 Hog&#x27;s Back between Farnham where his father&#x27;s garage was located and the Guildford A3 factory where they both worked. Hawthorn never married, but fathered a son, Arnaud Michael Delaunay born 1954, with Jacqueline Delaunay, whom he met in Reims after winning the French Grand Prix in 1953. He was engaged at the time of his death to the fashion model Jean Howarth, who later married another racing driver, Innes Ireland, in 1993.

==Death==

On 22 January 1959, only three months into his retirement, Hawthorn died in a car accident on the A3 Guildford bypass near Onslow Village, while driving his comprehensively modified 1958 Jaguar 3.4-litre saloon (now known as the 3.4 Mk 1) VDU 881 to London. While the circumstances of the accident are well documented, the precise cause remains unknown.

The accident occurred on a notoriously dangerous section of the road, the scene of 15 serious accidents (two fatal) in the previous two years; the road was also wet at the time. Driving at speed (one witness estimated 80 m.p.h.), Hawthorn overtook a Mercedes-Benz 300SL &#x27;gull-wing&#x27; sports car driven by an acquaintance, the motor racing team manager Rob Walker. On entering a right-hand bend shortly after passing the Mercedes, Hawthorn clipped a &#x27;Keep Left&#x27; bollard dividing the two carriageways, causing him to lose control. The Jaguar glanced an oncoming Bedford lorry before careering back across the eastbound carriageway sideways into a roadside tree, uprooting it. The impact caused Hawthorn fatal head injuries and propelled him onto the rear seat.

There was inevitable speculation that Hawthorn and Walker had been racing each other, fuelled by Walker&#x27;s persistent refusal at the coroner&#x27;s inquest to estimate the speed of his own car at the time. In an interview with motor racing journalist Eoin Young and writer Eric Dymock in 1988, Walker admitted he had indeed been racing Hawthorn, but had been advised by a police officer investigating the accident to make no further mention of it lest he incriminate himself.

Possible causes of the accident include driver error, a blackout, or mechanical failure, although examination of the wreck revealed no obvious fault. There is evidence that Hawthorn had recently suffered blackouts, perhaps because of kidney failure. By 1955, Hawthorn had already lost one kidney to infection, and had begun suffering problems with the other; he was expected at the time to live only three more years.

At the coroner&#x27;s inquest on 26 January the jury returned a verdict of accidental death. Hawthorn was buried in West Street Cemetery in Farnham.

==Eponymy==
In Farnham, the town where he lived up to the time of his death, there is a street named Mike Hawthorn Drive. It was in this town that Hawthorn ran the Tourist Trophy Garage which sold Jaguars, Rileys, Fiats and Ferraris. The garage still exists and is now named after him. There is a hill and corner named after him at Brands Hatch and a corner at the Croft racing circuit at Croft-on-Tees in North Yorkshire, while in Towcester on the Shires estate, three miles from the Silverstone circuit, Hawthorn Drive is named after him. There is a statue at Goodwood Circuit commemorating Hawthorn as the UK&#x27;s first Formula One World Champion.

===Hawthorn Memorial Trophy===

The Hawthorn Memorial Trophy has been awarded to the most successful British or Commonwealth Formula 1 driver every year since . Lewis Hamilton has won the award the most times, taking the trophy on eleven occasions.

<doc id="128173" wikidata="Q58620" url="?curid=128173" title="Hans Fritzsche">
<text>August Franz Anton Hans Fritzsche (21 April 1900 – 27 September 1953) was the &quot;Ministerialdirektor&quot; at the &quot;Propagandaministerium&quot; (Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda) of Nazi Germany. He was the preeminent German broadcaster of his time, as part of efforts to present a more popular and entertaining side of the Nazi regime, and his voice was recognised by the majority of Germans.

Fritzsche was present in the Berlin &quot;Führerbunker&quot; during the last days of Adolf Hitler. After Hitler&#x27;s death, he went over to the Soviet lines in Berlin to offer the surrender of the city to the Red Army on 1 May 1945. He was taken prisoner.

== Biography ==
Fritzsche was born in Bochum (a city in the Ruhr region) to a Prussian postal clerk. He volunteered in the German Army in 1917 as a private soldier, and served in Flanders. After the war, he studied at the universities of Greifswald and Berlin, but did not pass his examinations. In 1923 he joined the conservative German National People&#x27;s Party headed by Alfred Hugenberg and also became a journalist for the Hugenberg Press, which promoted nationalistic opinions not very different from the Nazis. In September 1932, he began his broadcasting career as head of the &quot;Drahtloser Dienst&quot; (the Wireless News service, a government agency), and started his first broadcast, a daily program called &quot;Hans Fritzsche speaks&quot; (&quot;Es spricht Hans Fritzsche&quot;).

Following the Nazi seizure of power, the Wireless News service with Fritzsche as its head, was incorporated into Joseph Goebbels&#x27; Propaganda Ministry on 1 May 1933. Fritzsche joined the Nazi Party that same day. He later joined the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA). He also was made a member of the Academy for German Law. In 1938, Fritzsche became head of the Press Division. In November 1942, he became head of the Radio Division. Fritzsche had no involvement in creating policy. During the war, Fritzsche was Germany&#x27;s most prominent radio commentator.

In April 1945, he was present in the Berlin &quot;Führerbunker&quot; during the last days of Adolf Hitler and Goebbels. After Hitler&#x27;s suicide on 30 April 1945, Goebbels assumed Hitler&#x27;s role as chancellor. On 1 May, Goebbels completed his sole official act as chancellor. He dictated a letter to Soviet Army General Vasily Chuikov, requesting a temporary ceasefire and ordered German General Hans Krebs to deliver it. Chuikov commanded the Soviet forces in central Berlin. After this was rejected, Goebbels decided that further efforts were futile. Goebbels then launched into a tirade berating the generals, reminding them Hitler forbade them to surrender. Fritzsche left the room to try to take matters into his own hands. He went to his nearby office on Wilhelmplatz and wrote a surrender letter addressed to Soviet Marshall Georgy Zhukov. An angry and drunk General Wilhelm Burgdorf followed Fritzsche to his office. There he asked Fritzsche if he intended to surrender Berlin. Fritzsche replied that he was going to do just that. Burgdorf shouted that Hitler had forbidden surrender and as a civilian he had no authority to do so. Burgdorf then pulled his pistol to shoot Fritzsche, but a radio technician knocked the gun and the bullet fired hit the ceiling. Several men then hustled Burgdorf out of the office and he returned to the bunker. Fritzsche then left his office and went over to the Soviet lines and offered to surrender the city.

=== Military tribunal ===

Fritzsche was taken prisoner by Soviet Red Army soldiers. At first he was held prisoner in a basement and then sent to Moscow for interrogation at Lubyanka Prison where, according to his own account, three gold teeth were yanked from his mouth upon arrival. He was confined to a &quot;standing coffin&quot;, a cell where it was impossible to sleep, and placed on a bread and hot water diet. He eventually signed a confession. Later, he wrote his account of Soviet prison while on trial at Nuremberg, which was published in Switzerland.

Fritzsche was sent to Nuremberg, and tried before the International Military Tribunal. He was charged with conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity. In his positions in the propaganda apparatus of the Nazi State, Fritzsche played a role to further the conspiracy to commit atrocities and to launch the war of aggression. According to journalist and author William L. Shirer, it was unclear to the attendees why he was charged. Shirer remarked that &quot;no-one in the courtroom, including Fritzsche, seemed to know why he was there – he was too small a fry – unless it were as a ghost for Goebbels&quot;. According to the IMT prosecution, he &quot;incited and encouraged the commission of War Crimes by deliberately falsifying news to arouse in the German People those passions which led them to the commission of atrocities&quot;. Fritzsche was acquitted because the court was &quot;not prepared to hold that [his broadcasts] were intended to incite the German people to commit atrocities on conquered peoples&quot;. He was one of only three defendants to be acquitted at Nuremberg (along with Hjalmar Schacht and Franz von Papen).

Nuremberg prosecutor Alexander Hardy later said that evidence not available to the prosecution at the time proved Fritzsche not only knew of the extermination of European Jews but also &quot;played an important part in bringing [Nazi crimes] about,&quot; and would have resulted in his conviction and execution. Fritzsche was later classified as Group I (Major Offenders) by a denazification court, which sentenced him nine years of hard labor in a labor camp. He was released under an amnesty in September 1950. He married his second wife, Hildegard Springer, in 1950. Fritzsche died of cancer in 1953. His wife died by suicide the same year.

Fritzsche, along with Albert Speer and Baldur von Schirach, were eventually communed by Lutheran Pastor Henry F. Gerecke and were administered the Eucharist.

According to British intelligence, Fritzsche was part of the Naumann Circle in the early 1950s, a group of ex-Nazis who aimed to infiltrate the Free Democratic Party and eventually restore the Nazi state.

==History==
In 1860, there existed Campbell&#x27;s Mill in Robeson County. That year the Wilmington, Charlotte and Rutherford Railroad constructed an east–west line through the area, but no strong community developed and no train station was erected, probably due to the proximity of the larger communities of Moss Neck and Pates. In 1892, the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad proposed building a north–south line through Moss Neck, but at the opposition of a prominent citizen the line was moved a few miles west to Campbell&#x27;s Mill. A train station was erected, and the Atlantic Land and Improvement Company plotted one square mile of streets centered around it. Lots were sold to private holders and the community quickly became a center for commerce.

In 1895 the community&#x27;s population stood at approximately 150 residents. It was incorporated that year as the town of Pembroke, named for railway worker Pembroke Jones. In 1909 the Croatan Normal School was moved there. The earliest buildings in the community were made of wood, with awnings built to cover their entrances. The first brick building was erected in 1922. Around that time, Pates Supply Company, a general store, was established and became the largest business in Pembroke. A highway was established in 1923 along the east–west railroad, and the first street was paved in 1932. Pembroke became a center for Lumbee commercial activity, though most kept to the rural areas of the county. Due to their predominance in the community, the town lacked strict adherence to many Jim Crow norms common in the South in early 20th century.

Under the town&#x27;s incorporating act, its citizens elected a mayor and a board of commissioners every year. Politically, the town fell under the control of its white minority, though by 1917 the Lumbee community had grown rapidly and was challenging this state of affairs. A white delegation went to Raleigh and petitioned the North Carolina General Assembly to alter the act. Under the new system, the Governor of North Carolina appointed the mayor and the commissioners. Due to an informal agreement the town usually had two Lumbee commissioners and two white commissioners under a white mayor. In 1945 a group of Lumbees petitioned the governor to support democratic reform in the municipal government. Two years later, the town returned to an elected government and Pembroke chose its first Lumbee mayor.

The Old Main building at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke and Pembroke High School, Former are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Pembroke is the tribal seat of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, the largest state-recognized tribe east of the Mississippi River and the largest without a reservation. Their origin has been disputed historically, as they are multi-tribal. Some tribes migrated from neighboring counties and states. In the 1950s, those who identified as Native American chose the name Lumbee, after what was later renamed the Lumber River.

Pembroke is home to the University of North Carolina at Pembroke, a master&#x27;s level degree-granting university and one of the 17 schools that comprise the University of North Carolina system. It was incorporated within the University of North Carolina system in 1972 and officially became the University of North Carolina at Pembroke in 1996. Its enrollment is 7,667 as of fall 2022. With an 18:1 student-to-faculty ratio, the average class size is 20. It boasts the safest campus of the UNC schools in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; and is among the nation&#x27;s most diverse. Its motto is: &quot;Where learning gets personal.&quot;

==Education==
The only school district in the county is Robeson County Schools.

==Origin==
Many believe the origin of the Prospect community began when Preston Locklear claimed large swaths of land along what is known today as the Long Swamp.

Dr. Peter H. Wood lists Preston Locklear as a Tuscarora in his 1992 report &quot;Tuscarora Roots&quot;. In 1992 there were about 4,000 Tuscaroras in Robeson County, NC. Locklear is listed as a founder of the University of North Carolina at Pembroke in The Museum of the Southeast American Indian.

==Churches in Prospect==
Unlike the majority of Robeson County, the boundary of Prospect Community contains almost exclusively Methodist churches; the Methodist churches included within Prospect are Prospect United Methodist Church, Prospect Methodist Church, New Prospect Church, and New Prospect Methodist Church. Prospect United Methodist Church was itself founded by the Reverend W. L. Moore, the grandfather of Adolph Dial, founder of the American Indian Studies department at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. Notably, Island Grove Baptist Church and Preston Gospel Chapel are the only non-Methodist churches in the community. Island Grove having broken-off from the theology to join the Burnt Swamp Baptist Association in 1955. Preston Gospel Chapel was originally called Doogle Hill and was located about a half mile east of the current location. It was established by the Scottish around 1875 as part of the Assembly Movement. Preston&#x27;s original sanctuary was built in 1948. The present sanctuary was built in the late 1970s with the addition of a fellowship hall and small apartment for visiting preachers in the 1990s.

==Importance of Prospect United Methodist Church==
The pillar of Prospect community is Prospect United Methodist Church, or as it&#x27;s been known since it first appeared in the Wilmington Star in 1871, Prospect Church. The importance of Prospect Church to the community is best told through the vast assembly of its buildings, spanning a distance of 150 yards along W.L. Moore Road; this series of buildings, known as the &quot;Temple&quot; serves the largest congregation of Native Americans in the United States. The construction of the church, which would become the basis for the founding of Prospect Community, was due in large part to the efforts of local farmers in the area, allowing them to come together relative to their shared space. Over the course of the years major construction projects leading to new buildings were completed in 1865, 1876, 1895, 1946, 1961, 1970, 1976, 1987 and 1989. Though no longer standing, the original structure built in 1865 and the second structure built in 1876, were both made of logs and pegs, with the 1865 structure also serving as a single-room schoolhouse. The 1895 assembly, the last structure to be made out of timber, still stands today behind Moore&#x27;s Chainsaw. The church is now the main producer of spokespeople for Lumbee Methodist, with members attending national conferences as representatives and delegates for the American Indian-Methodist community. The church also has had an active role in the community&#x27;s schools and education, with a daily worship service offered by the church to local high school students, and the establishment of the Anderson Scholarship Fund to help benefit those who pursue church vocations as a result of being a part of the youth services.

==Adolph Dial==
A notable member of Prospect Methodist Church, Adolph Dial was the Founding Chairman of the Department of American Indian Studies at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. Born in Prospect in 1922 to Noah and Mary Ellen Dial, Dial would become a leading authority in academia for not only the Lumbee tribe, but also among North Carolinian and national historians in the field of Native American studies. Though Dial gained statewide recognition soon after his employment at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke in 1958, Dial grew to national prominence during his tenure on the American Indian Policy Review Commission. In 1971, the Ford Foundation provided Dial and fellow history professor at UNC-P, David Eliades a great for continued research on the Lumbee Indians—this in turn led to the publication of the 1975 ethnography, &quot;The Only Land I Know: A History of the Lumbee Indians&quot;, an expansive history of the tribe covering its history from colonialism through the modern day. Dial&#x27;s contributions have led to the establishment of scholarly awards in his name at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke, as well the naming of the Dial Humanities Building on the school&#x27;s campus.

Adolph Dial believed he was descended from John White&#x27;s Lost Colonists, specifically Virginia Dare.

<text>St. Pauls is a town in Robeson County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 2,045 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The town of St. Pauls was built up around St. Pauls Presbyterian Church, which was built on land donated in 1799 by William Davis. St. Pauls grew slowly from a town of just the church, Davis&#x27; home, a post office and a livery stable. The livery was built at the 16-mile post on the Fayetteville to Lumberton stage coach road. Growth began in earnest following the construction of the Robeson Institute, a co-educational school that served the children of northern Robeson County.

The construction of the Virginia and Carolina Southern Railway through St. Pauls helped establish the community as a leading producer of textiles. Three cotton mills were constructed in the early part of the 20th century. The mills experienced periods of success and failure before coming under the control of the Burlington Mills Corporation in 1943. The mills provided significant tax revenue to the town, at one point enabling it to supply free water, sewer, and trash services to residents. Nearly all the mills closed in the 1990s as the textile industry moved from the American South to Latin America and Southeast Asia. The closure of two yarn plants in 2001 led to the loss of over 500 jobs. In the 2000s the job market in the town stagnated, experiencing only minimal growth from the commercial sector developed near Interstate 95. In the 2010s the town secured multiple large corporate investments and relocations.

The Gilmore-Patterson Farm and Kenneth McKinnon House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="128187" wikidata="Q1283521" url="?curid=128187" title="Eden, North Carolina">
<text>Eden is a city in Rockingham County in the U.S. state of North Carolina and is part of the Greensboro-High Point Metropolitan Statistical Area of the Piedmont Triad region. As of the 2020 census, the population was 15,405. From the late nineteenth century through much of the 20th, the city was a center of textile mills and manufacturing. The city was incorporated in 1967 through the consolidation of three towns: Leaksville, Spray, and Draper.

==History==
By the mid-eighteenth century, the territory of present-day Eden was within a estate owned by William Byrd II, a planter of Virginia and North Carolina. He originally called his estate &quot;The Land of Eden&quot;.

During the last years of his life, William Byrd II dreamed of bringing large numbers of Swiss Protestants to the &quot;Land of Eden&quot;; he eventually acquired more than in Virginia. He envisioned an industrious, self-sufficient colony that would thrive on the abundance of the frontier. Byrd&#x27;s dream was not to be realized. After years of negotiations, at least one boatload of Swiss did sail for &quot;The Land of Eden&quot; from Europe, but it was shipwrecked in a December gale off the coast of Virginia. None of the few survivors are believed to have reached Eden. Byrd died August 26, 1744. By that time, the &quot;Land of Eden&quot; began to be surrounded by small farms held by a wave of poor Scotch-Irish immigrants, whom Byrd had compared to the &quot;Goths and Vandals.&quot;

&quot;Eden&quot; was inherited by William Byrd III, who shared none of his father&#x27;s dreams of colonization. Young Byrd married Elizabeth Hill Carter in 1748. He sought to dispose of Eden to gain cash to support his grand lifestyle. He was finally successful on November 8, 1755, when he sold in North Carolina to Simon and Francis Farley, two merchant brothers from the island of Antigua. By this time, yeoman settlement in the area was increasing at a considerable pace. The Farley brothers attempted to create plantations on some of the richest acres, but more frequently, settlers squatted on the land and built homesteads. In 1762 James Parke Farley, son of Francis Farley, went to Williamsburg to attend the College of William and Mary. He married Elizabeth Hill Byrd, daughter of William Byrd III and Elizabeth Hill Carter.

Many later settlers migrating to the Dan River Area knew little of William Byrd. They were familiar with an old Indian village in the area near Town Creek and the Farley holdings. This location became the center of settlement, and the came to be called the Sauratown tract. In 1775, James Parke Farley and his new bride moved from cosmopolitan Williamsburg, Virginia, to Sauratown.

In the century that Sauratown was in existence, many families settled in the &quot;Land of Eden&quot;, and their descendants have stayed in the area, including the Brodnax, Dillard, Ruffin, Morehead, Henry, and Winston families. Many Scots also settled in the area, including the Galloway, Scales, Watt, Lenox, Campbell, and Moir families. Other notable residents of the county include General Lighthorse Harry Lee.

===20th century to present===
Following previous unsuccessful referendums, on September 12, 1967, residents of Leaksville, Draper, Spray, and the unincorporated Meadows Greens Sanitary District voted to consolidate their communities, 2,252 to 1,753 with 60 percent of eligible voters participating. Of these, 784 elected to call the new city Eden, a term surveyor William Byrd II had used to describe the region in the 1700s. The consolidation took immediate effect, and Eden became the largest city in Rockingham County.

* In 1970, the city had considerable growth. 
* In 2000, city population grew to 15,908. 
* In 2010, the US Census population was 15,527. 
* In 2014, 39,000 thousand tons of coal ash and 27 million gallons of contaminated water spilled into the Dan River near Eden from a coal-fired power plant owned by Duke Energy.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s the local economy suffered due to the closure of several textile mills- an expected byproduct of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Fieldcrest Cannon laid off hundreds of corporate staff in the 1990s, Pluma closed its plant in 1999, and Spray Cotton Mills closed its yarn mill in 2001, and Pillowtex folded in 2003. Some former workers moved to larger cities in search of jobs. The decline of textiles left the Miller Brewing Company&#x27;s facility the town&#x27;s flagship industry, but it announced its closure in 2015. The loss of the brewery and the textile mills had a knock-off effect on local retail stores, many of which closed due to the loss of customers and competition from national chains such as Walmart.

==Major industry and economy==

Eden has three downtown areas, concentrated in the former towns of Leaksville, Spray, and Draper.

B. Frank Mebane, who had married into the prominent Morehead family, started the first of his six textile mills in the area in 1893. Marshall Field took over the company in 1912 and named it Fieldcrest. The company made textile products that included bedding: sheets and blankets. It employed more than 3000 people. After taking over Cannon Mills in 1986, the company became known as Fieldcrest Cannon; it later moved its headquarters and 110 employees to Kannapolis, North Carolina. Changes and restructuring were affecting the textile industry throughout the South, as companies moved manufacturing operations to areas with cheaper labor, including offshore.

In 1997 Fieldcrest Cannon was sold to Pillowtex. Pillowtex closed its Eden plants in 2003, laying off the last 495 textile workers.

Miller Brewing Company ran a brewery in Eden into the early 21st century. In 2012 it still employed nearly seven hundred people, and produced nine million barrels annually. Miller announced in 2015 that it was shutting down the brewery by September 2016. In September 2020, it was announced Nestle Purina will move into the old MillerCoors facility and will open in 2022.

In February 2017, it was announced that the European-based German grocery store Lidl had broken ground on a store in Eden. It was expected to open in early 2018. As of April, 2019, the store had not opened.

In 1980, the Eden Mall, an approximately 400,000 square feet shopping center, was constructed. The mall began to decline in the late 1990s when its Kmart store closed. More stores began to shut down, culminating in the departures of Peebles in 2008 and Belk in 2015. The mall&#x27;s physical condition deteriorated over the following years. It was sold in 2013 and subsequently leased out to local businesses. In the late 2010s, the mall gained media attention and became an example of a &quot;Dead mall&quot; due to lack of stores in the mall and had no anchors left, the mall closed to the public in early 2020s.

<doc id="128192" wikidata="Q269015" url="?curid=128192" title="Reidsville, North Carolina">
<text>Reidsville is a city in Rockingham County in the U.S. state of North Carolina. At the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 14,583. Reidsville is included in the Greensboro–High Point Metropolitan Statistical Area of the Piedmont Triad.

Reidsville was established in the early 19th century as an outpost and stop on the stage line that ran between Salisbury, North Carolina, and Danville, Virginia, and was originally known as Wright&#x27;s Crossroads. The community grew from a single home and inn owned by the family of Reuben Reid, a local farmer, businessman, justice of the peace and father of David S. Reid), into a thriving farming community primarily supporting tobacco production and cigarette manufacturing. Reidsville was officially incorporated by the North Carolina State Legislature in 1873 and became a key location of the American Tobacco Company which employed large numbers of city and county residents. The American Tobacco Company was the mainstay of Reidsville economics until its sale and closure in 1994. Many textile mills were established in Reidsville as well, with Cone Mills and Burlington Industries, located in Burlington North Carolina, consolidating most of them in the mid-20th century, although most have now closed. Although Reidsville has experienced economic recession in recent years the community has enjoyed a renewal of growth as a sleeper city supplying a source of rural development for the surrounding larger cities.

==History==
The roots of Reidsville date back to the early 19th century when William Wright of the Little Troublesome Creek area owned a tavern and store on the road connecting Danville and Salem. This outpost, called Wright&#x27;s Crossroads, was the earliest settlement in the present-day city and was overseen by Wright&#x27;s son, Nathan, and then Nathan Wright&#x27;s son-in-law, Robert Payne Richardson. Richardson&#x27;s home, built in 1842 on a knoll overlooking Little Troublesome Creek, still remains on Richardson Drive and has the distinction of being the oldest standing house in the city.

Reuben Reid of the Hogan&#x27;s Creek area moved his family, including wife, Elizabeth Williams Settle, and son, David Settle Reid, to a farm on the ridge between Wolf Island and Little Troublesome creeks in May 1814. Reuben Reid became a successful farmer, operated a store and a public inn maintained in a private home and served the county as a constable and justice of the peace. When the family secured a post office, aptly named Reidsville, in 1829, 16-year-old David Reid was appointed its first postmaster. He later became a State Senator (1835–42), a U.S. Congressman (1843–47), Governor of North Carolina (1850) and a U.S. Senator (1854).

On November 26, 1858, William Lindsey of Pittsylvania County, Virginia, was high bidder for a tract of land known as Reidsville. He and his bride, Sarah Holderby, a daughter of Joseph Holderby of the northern part of the county, moved into the frame house Reuben Reid had built across from his store. It is now a landmark in Reidsville, the first frame house built in the village.
Reidsville is located in east-central Rockingham County. The Southern Railroad passes through the center of the city from north to south. However, the town has not had a functional train station since 1988. The town was incorporated in 1873 by the Legislature. Tobacco was a mainstay of the local economy for many years, with the history of the city tightly woven with that of American Tobacco Company. With the sale of American Tobacco in 1994, city leaders have diversified the local economy. The Reidsville Chamber of Commerce, established in 1923 by business leaders in the community, is now located downtown.

The Chinqua-Penn Plantation, First Baptist Church, Jennings-Baker House, Richardson Houses Historic District, Reuben Wallace McCollum House, North Washington Avenue Workers&#x27; House, Penn House, Gov. David S. Reid House, Reidsville High School, Former, and Reidsville Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The total area is 10.14% water.

===Downtown area===
The downtown area of Reidsville was like many of its counterparts across the state in the 1970s, seeing a decline in business opportunities due to the emergence of malls and shopping centers. The Reidsville Downtown Corporation, a non-profit organization financed by monies from the Downtown District Tax, was created in 1976 to lead the charge to revitalize the downtown.

Joint projects of the Downtown Corporation and the City of Reidsville have been participation in the Main Street Program, the Streetscape Program and Façade Incentive Grant program. Each of these programs was initiated to aid in the revitalization of the downtown and improve the area aesthetically.

Lewis Tobacco company was established in the south side of the land that was to become the town of Stoneville. In the late 1850s, brothers Thomas and Pinkney Stone bought land in the area. On March 5, 1877, the town was officially incorporated. A natural stop on the Norfolk-Western rail line, Stoneville became the trade hub for the surrounding localities and profited off of tobacco, cotton and grist-milling industries.

Several buildings in the downtown were completely removed, and most cleanup and repair work was done within a year.

==History==
Wentworth was established as &quot;Rockingham Courthouse&quot; in 1787 making it the oldest settlement in Rockingham County. The post office there was established in November 1794. The settlement was chartered as Wentworth in 1798. Both, Wentworth and Rockingham County were named in homage to the same individual; the Marquis of Rockingham, Charles Watson-Wentworth. Watson-Wentworth served two terms as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and greatly advocated for colonial independence.
Almost two hundred years later, in the 1990s, the Wentworth community was facing the possibility of much of its area being annexed into neighboring Reidsville which had repeatedly but unsuccessfully tried to take the county seat for over a century. County officials, none of whom lived in Wentworth, declined to oppose this possible annexation. Nevertheless, the local community banded together with an initiative which stopped this impending annexation. In 1998, with approval from the state General Assembly, the town of Wentworth amended the lapse within their original 1798 charter and remained as its own municipality. Until its reactivation (which included an area considerably larger than the original courthouse village of approximately one hundred people) Wentworth was the smallest county seat in the state.

The Dead Timber Ford Sluices, Eagle Falls Sluice, Rockingham County Courthouse, Wentworth Methodist Episcopal Church and Cemetery, and Wright Tavern are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Government==
One of the most widely used forms of government by small cities in North Carolina, Wentworth is governed under the mayor-council form of government. The Wentworth Town Council has five members, from which one is elected mayor and one is elected mayor pro tem. Council members are elected in nonpartisan elections and serve four year terms.

==Courthouse==
Originally, the first session of the Rockingham County Court met at Eagle Falls on the Dan River in 1786. In 1787 a courthouse was established near the center of the county and the settlement was known as Rockingham Courthouse. However, in 1798, the General Assembly of North Carolina passed an act which established the county seat to be known as Wentworth at the site of the 1787 Courthouse. This courthouse was replaced by a brick courthouse in 1824 and this building was considerably remodeled in a more Victorian style in the 1880s. On October 2, 1906, a terrific fire destroyed the old courthouse and a new one, designed by famed architect Frank Pierce Milburn, was constructed at a cost of $25,000. The newer courthouse was composed almost entirely of bricks and had two beautiful rounded pillars which quickly became a trademark of the Wentworth community. It was at this courthouse in August 1932 that Broadway torch singer Libby Holman posted bond when she was charged (later acquitted) with the alleged murder of her husband, tobacco heir Z. Smith Reynolds of Winston-Salem. Additions to the courthouse were made in the 1930s, 1960s and 1970s. In 1982 former Vice President Walter Mondale gave a speech at the courthouse prior to his candidacy for president in 1984. A couple of years later the old historic superior courtroom was stripped of its fittings and gutted to make two smaller and inadequate courtrooms. In May 2011, a new 184,516 square foot Rockingham County courthouse, also known as the &quot;Rockingham County Justice Center,&quot; opened its doors at a location one mile east of the historic village area where the courthouses had been since 1787. Construction of this new state-of-the-art building cost $39,059,000, after an originally projected cost of $37,757,000. The three-story Justice Center houses county law enforcement services as well as the county courthouse. 
The 1907 courthouse, on the National Register of Historic Places, now houses the Museum &amp; Archives of Rockingham County (the MARC), Rockingham County&#x27;s historical museum.

<text>Granite Quarry is a town in Rowan County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 2,984 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Granite Quarry was originally named Woodville when it was founded in the late 1800s. However, the first post office in the town was established under the name of Woodsides in 1891, after a prominent family in the area named Woodsides. The name was officially changed to Woodsides when the town was incorporated on March 7, 1901, by the North Carolina General Assembly. Jerry L. Shuping was the first mayor. The first town meetings were held in an upstairs room in the W. S. Brown store building. What is now the Town Hall Municipal Building was originally built in 1963 by Gemgas, and purchased later by the town.

Soon after the town&#x27;s incorporation, however, problems arose with mail delivery, since there was already another town in North Carolina named Woodsides. Because of this, in 1902, the post office changed its name to Granite Quarry, after the stone quarried in the area. The town&#x27;s name was not officially changed until February 5, 1905.

The Michael Braun House and Granite Quarry School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Though town officials have been working to change this since 1990, residents and businesses who get their mail delivered have a Salisbury address because the Granite Quarry post office only has boxes, not delivery. A proposal rejected by the Postal Service would have allowed a Granite Quarry address but a Salisbury zip code. In early November 2015, with the help of U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, the town persuaded the Postal Service make the change.

<doc id="128203" wikidata="Q2028813" url="?curid=128203" title="Salisbury, North Carolina">
<text>Salisbury ( ) is a city in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, United States; it has been the county seat of Rowan County since 1753 when its territory extended to the Mississippi River. Located northeast of Charlotte and within its metropolitan area, the town has attracted a growing population. The 2020 census shows 35,580 residents.

Salisbury is the oldest continually populated colonial town in the western region of North Carolina. It is noted for its historic preservation, with five Local Historic Districts and ten National Register Historic Districts.

Soft drink producer Cheerwine and regional supermarket Food Lion are located in Salisbury and Rack Room Shoes was founded there.

==History==


In 1753 an appointed Anglo-European trustee for Rowan County was directed to enter of land for a County Seat, and public buildings were erected. The deed is dated February 11, 1755, when John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville conveyed for the &quot;Salisbury Township&quot;. The settlement was built at the intersection of longtime Native American trading routes. It became an economic hub along what was improved as the Great Wagon Road in North Carolina. It became the principal city of the Salisbury judicial and militia districts in the years leading up to the American Revolutionary War. On June 12, 1792, Salisbury was granted a US Post Office. Its first postmaster was George Lauman. This post office has been in continuous operation ever since.

During the United States Civil War, Salisbury was home to the first and only Confederate Prison in North Carolina, used to house captured Union prisoners-of-war (POWs), dissident Southerners, and Confederate defectors. On July 9, 1861, six weeks after North Carolina declared secession from the Union, the Confederate government asked Governor Henry T. Clark if the state could provide a place to hold prisoners of war (POWs). The 20-year-old Maxwell Chambers textile mill in Salisbury, then vacant, was retrofitted for that purpose. The prison was only designed to hold up to 2,500 prisoners, but by 1864, more than 10,000 prisoners had arrived due to the fall of Atlanta and the ongoing siege of Richmond, Virginia. By February 1865, prisoners were transferred out of the Salisbury prison, and in April 1865, Union Major George Stoneman destroyed the prison and other Confederate installations collectively known as the Salisbury Arsenal. The next month, Federal troops occupied the town, and in early September 1865 the Union commander turned over civil control of Salisbury to local town officials. The Salisbury National Cemetery was established on a portion of the former prison site, starting because of thousands of Union soldiers who died while imprisoned.

Owing to its Confederate history, Salisbury long retained pride in a deep local culture of Confederate apologism, thanks in part to Rowan County being the home of Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon Bob Jones, whose impact on Salisbury was featured in a PBS documentary film called &quot;Klansville, USA&quot;. Confederate re-enactments are also a popular activity in Salisbury, including annual re-enactments at the Josephus Hall House, an antebellum manse in downtown Salisbury that was home to Dr. Josephus Hall, who was the surgeon at the Confederate prison.

In the antebellum period and after the American Civil War, Salisbury was the trading city of an upland area devoted to cultivation of cotton as a commodity crop. It was also the business and law center of the county. Numerous houses and other structures were built by wealthy planters and merchants in this period. In the late 19th century, the city was served by railroads, becoming a railroad hub as people and freight were transported along the eastern corridor.

After three black men were lynched in Salisbury in 1906, one of the lynchers was prosecuted. This resulted in the first conviction for lynching in North Carolina, and one of the first in the United States.

In the 20th century, Salisbury&#x27;s economy grew into an industrial-based economy. Entrepreneurs developed the textile industry for processing cotton, first, and numerous textile mills operated in the city.

The industry owners moved their jobs and mills offshore in the late 20th century, to areas with cheaper labor costs. This change cost the city and area many jobs, and unemployment rose for a period. Since 2000, the city&#x27;s population has grown rapidly, with people attracted to the city&#x27;s resources and amenities.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, as of 2010, the city has a total area of , all land.

Salisbury is located in the Central Piedmont of North Carolina in the Charlotte metropolitan area. The city is 21 miles north of Concord, 38 miles south of Winston-Salem, and 25 miles northeast of Charlotte.

<text>Spencer is a town in Rowan County, North Carolina, United States, incorporated in 1905. As of the 2010 census, the town population was 3,267.

==History==

The town was named for Samuel Spencer, first president of the Southern Railway, who is credited with establishment of the railroad&#x27;s mechanical shops at the site in 1896. The site was approximately the midpoint of the railroad&#x27;s mainline between Atlanta, GA and Washington, D.C. As the shops were being built the Southern Railway developed a town, also named Spencer, alongside the shops for worker housing. Initially, the Southern partitioned 85 acres into 500 lots. Instead of creating a traditional &quot;company&quot; town in which the workers rented houses Southern sold the lots to workers or businesses for $100 apiece. The deeds did contain restrictive covenants which maintained that a dwelling costing in excess of $400 and approved by a Southern appointed architect be built within a year. The Southern donated lots for religious institutions. Southern also helped establish a YMCA in the town. The community grew quickly and by 1901 had 625 residents. By the 1920s it had 4,000 residents.

The former Spencer Shops were phased out during the 1950s through 1970s and have now become the location of the North Carolina Transportation Museum.

The Alexander Long House, Southern Railway&#x27;s Spencer Shops, and Spencer Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Greifswald (), officially the University and Hanseatic City of Greifswald (, Low German: &quot;Griepswoold&quot;, Kashubian:&quot; Grifiô&quot;) is the fourth-largest city in the German state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania after Rostock, Schwerin and Neubrandenburg. In 2021 it surpassed Stralsund for the first time, and became the largest city in the Pomeranian part of the state. It sits on the River Ryck, at its mouth into the Danish Wiek, a sub-bay of the Bay of Greifswald, which is itself a sub-bay of the Bay of Pomerania of the Baltic Sea.

It is the seat of the district of Western Pomerania-Greifswald, and is located roughly in the middle between the two largest Pomeranian islands of Rugia (&quot;Rügen&quot;) and Usedom. The closest larger cities are Stralsund, Rostock, Szczecin and Schwerin. It lies west of the River Zarow, the historical cultural and linguistic boundary between West (west of the river) and Central Pomerania (east of the river). The city derives its name from the dukes of Pomerania, the House of Griffin, and thus ultimately from the Pomeranian Griffin, and its name hence translates as &quot;Griffin&#x27;s Forest&quot;.

The University of Greifswald, which was founded in 1456, is the second-oldest university in the Baltic Region after the University of Rostock. The city is well-known for the ruins of Eldena Abbey (formerly &quot;Hilda Abbey&quot;), a frequent subject of the paintings of Caspar David Friedrich, who was born in the city when it was part of Swedish Pomerania. Greifswald is the seat of the Pomeranian State Museum (&quot;Pommersches Landesmuseum&quot;). The recently built Ryck Barrier (&quot;Rycksperrwerk&quot;) protects the city from exceptionally high tides and storm surges moving up from the Baltic.

The city&#x27;s population was listed at 59,332 in 2021, including many of the 12,500 students and 5,000 employees of the University of Greifswald. Greifswald draws international attention due to the university, its surrounding BioCon Valley, the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline which ends at nearby Lubmin, and the Wendelstein 7-X nuclear fusion projects.

==Geography==
Greifswald is located in the northeast of Germany, approximately equidistant from Germany&#x27;s two largest islands, Rügen and Usedom. The city is situated at the south end of the Bay of Greifswald, the historic centre being about up the river Ryck that crosses the city. The area around Greifswald is mainly flat, and hardly reaches more than 20 m above sea level. Two islands, Koos and Riems, are also part of Greifswald. Three of Germany&#x27;s fourteen national parks can be reached by car in one hour or less from Greifswald.

Greifswald is also roughly equidistant from Germany&#x27;s two largest cities, Berlin () and Hamburg (). The nearest larger cities are Stralsund and Rostock.

The coastal part of Greifswald at the mouth of the Ryck, named Greifswald-Wieck, evolved from a fishing village. Today it provides a small beach, a marina and the main port for Greifswald.

=== Climate ===
Greifswald features an oceanic climate with some humid continental influence. Summers are pleasantly warm, although chilly at night. Due to its coastal location, heatwaves in Greifswald tend to be less extreme than other nearby locations inland. Winters are mild to cold, with occasional cold fronts coming in from Scandinavia or Siberia. Precipitation is spread throughout the year and comparatively low by German standards, while sunshine hours are above the German average.

==History==

===Early history===

Greifswald was founded in 1199 when Cistercian monks founded the Eldena Abbey. In 1250, Wartislaw III, Duke of Pomerania, granted town privileges to Greifswald according to the Lübeck law.

===Middle Ages and Reformation===


In medieval times, the site of Greifswald was an unsettled woodland which marked the border between the Danish Principality of Rügen and the Pomeranian County of Gützkow, which at that time was also under Danish control. In 1199, the Rugian Prince Jaromar I allowed Danish Cistercian monks to build Hilda Abbey, now Eldena Abbey, at the mouth of the River Ryck. Among the lands granted the monks was a natural salt evaporation pond a short way up the river, a site also crossed by an important south–north &quot;via regia&quot; trade route. This site was named &quot;Gryp(he)swold(e)&quot;, which is the Low German precursor of the city&#x27;s modern name – which means &quot;Griffin&#x27;s Forest.&quot; Legend says the monks were shown the best site for settlement by a mighty griffin living in a tree that supposedly grew on what became Greifswald&#x27;s oldest street, the &quot;Schuhagen&quot;. The town&#x27;s construction followed a scheme of rectangular streets, with church and market sites reserved in central positions. It was settled primarily by Germans in the course of the , but settlers from other nations and Wends from nearby were attracted, too.

The salt trade helped Eldena Abbey to become an influential religious center, and Greifswald became a widely known market. When the Danes had to surrender their Pomeranian lands south of the Ryck, after losing the Battle of Bornhöved in 1227, the town succeeded to the Pomeranian dukes. In 1241, the Rugian prince Wizlaw I and the Pomeranian duke Wartislaw III both granted Greifswald market rights. In 1250, the latter granted the town a charter under Lübeck law, after he had been permitted to acquire the town site as a fief from Eldena Abbey in 1248.

When Jazco of Salzwedel from Gützkow founded a Franciscan friary within the walls of Greifswald, the Cistercians at Eldena lost much of their influence on the city&#x27;s further development. Just beyond Greifswald&#x27;s western limits, a town-like suburb (&quot;Neustadt&quot;) arose, separated from Greifswald by a ditch. In 1264, Neustadt was incorporated and the ditch was filled in.

Eldena Abbey and the major buildings of Greifswald were erected in the North German Brick Gothic (&quot;Backsteingotik&quot;) style, found along the entire southern coast of the Baltic.

Due to a steady population increase, Greifswald became at the end of the 13th century one of the earliest members of the Hanseatic League, which further increased its trade and wealth. After 1296, Greifswald&#x27;s citizens no longer needed to serve in the Pomeranian army, and Pomeranian dukes did not reside in the city.

In 1456, Greifswald&#x27;s mayor Heinrich Rubenow laid the foundations of one of the oldest universities in the world, the University of Greifswald, which was one of the first in Germany, and was, successively, the single oldest in Sweden and Prussia.

In the course of Reformation, Eldena Abbey ceased to function as a monastery. Its possessions fell to the Pomeranian dukes; the bricks of its Gothic buildings were used by the locals for other construction. Eldena lost its separate status and was later absorbed into the town of Greifswald. The religious houses within the town walls, the priories of the Blackfriars (Dominicans) in the northwest and the Greyfriars (Franciscans) in the southeast, were secularized. The buildings of the Dominicans (the &quot;black monastery&quot;) were turned over to the university; the site is still used as part of the medical campus. The Franciscan friary (&quot;the &quot;grey monastery&quot;) and its succeeding buildings are now the Pomeranian State Museum.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Greifswald was occupied by (Catholic) Imperial forces from 1627 to 1631, and thereafter, under the Treaty of Stettin (1630), by (Protestant) Swedish forces.

===1631/48—1815: Sweden===


During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Swedish forces entered the Duchy of Pomerania in 1630. Greifswald was besieged by Swedish troops on 12 June 1631 and surrendered on 16 June. Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden had returned from Brandenburg to supervise the siege, and upon his arrival received the university&#x27;s homage for the liberation from Catholic forces. After the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), Greifswald and the region surrounding it became part of the Kingdom of Sweden. Swedish Pomerania, as it was then called, remained part of the Swedish kingdom until 1815, when it became part of the Kingdom of Prussia as the Province of Pomerania. In 1871, it devolved to Germany.

The Thirty Years&#x27; War had caused starvation throughout Germany, and by 1630 Greifswald&#x27;s population had shrunk by two-thirds. Many buildings were left vacant and fell into decay. Soon, other wars followed: the Swedish-Polish War and the Swedish-Brandenburg War both involved the nominally Swedish town of Greifswald. In 1659 and 1678, Brandenburgian troops bombarded the town. The first bombardment hit mainly the northeast part of town, wrecking 16 houses. The second bombardment leveled 30 houses and damaged hundreds more all over the city. Cannonballs of this second bombardment can still be seen in the walls of St Mary&#x27;s Church.

During the Great Northern War (1700–1721, Greifswald was compelled to house soldiers. While besieging neighboring Stralsund, Russian tsar Peter the Great allied with George I of Great Britain in the Treaty of Greifswald. Large fires in 1713 and 1736 destroyed houses and other buildings, including City Hall. The Swedish government had issued decrees in 1669 and 1689 absolving anyone of taxes who built or rebuilt a house. These decrees remained essentially in force, under Prussian administration, until 1824.

In 1763, Greifswald Botanic Garden was founded.

===1815 – &quot;today&quot;: Germany===

During the 19th century, Greifswald attracted many Polish students. After Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland) and Berlin, Greifswald hosted the third-largest group of Polish students in Germany.

About 1900, the town – for the first time since the Middle Ages – expanded significantly beyond the old town walls. Also, a major railway connected Greifswald to Stralsund and Berlin; a local railway line further connected Greifswald to Wolgast.

The city survived World War II without much destruction, even though it housed a large German Army (&quot;Wehrmacht&quot;) garrison. During the war, in May 1940, the Stalag II-C prisoner-of-war camp was relocated to Greifswald from Dobiegniew, and it housed French, Belgian, Serbian and Soviet POWs with many sent to forced labor detachments in the region. In the spring of 1945, the camp was evacuated to the west. In April 1945, German Army Colonel (&quot;Oberst&quot;) Rudolf Petershagen defied orders and surrendered the city to the Red Army without a fight.

From 1949 to 1990, Greifswald was part of the German Democratic Republic (DDR). During this time, most historical buildings in the medieval parts of the city were neglected and a number of old buildings were pulled down. The population increased significantly, because of the construction of a nominal 1760 MW Soviet-made nuclear power plant in Lubmin, which was closed in the early 1990s. New suburbs were erected in the monolithic industrial socialist style (&quot;see Plattenbau&quot;). They still house most of the city&#x27;s population. These new suburbs were placed east and southeast of central Greifswald, shifting the former town center to the northwestern edge of the modern town.

Reconstruction of the old town began in the late 1980s. Nearly all of it has been restored. Before that almost all of the old northern town adjacent to the port was demolished and subsequently rebuilt. The historic marketplace is considered one of the most beautiful in northern Germany. The town attracts many tourists, due in part to its proximity to the Baltic Sea.

Greifswald&#x27;s greatest population was reached in 1988, with about 68,000 inhabitants, but it decreased afterward to 55,000, where it has now stabilized. Reasons for this included migration to western German cities as well as suburbanisation. However, the number of students quadrupled from 3,000 in 1990 to more than 11,000 in 2007 and the university employs 5,000 people; nearly one in three people in Greifswald are linked in some way to higher education.

Despite its relatively small population, Greifswald retains a supra-regional relevance linked to its intellectual role as a university town and to the taking of the central functions of the former Prussian Province of Pomerania after World War II, such as the seat of the bishop of the Pomeranian Lutheran Church, the state archives (&quot;Landesarchiv&quot;) and the Pomeranian Museum (&quot;Pommersches Landesmuseum&quot;). Three courts of the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also based at Greifswald:
* the Supreme Administrative Court (&quot;Oberverwaltungsgericht&quot;);
* the Supreme Constitutional Court (&quot;Landesverfassungsgericht&quot;); and
* the (&quot;Finanzgericht&quot;)

==Administrative division==

==Economy==
Greifswald and Stralsund are the largest cities in the Vorpommern part of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Of great importance to the city&#x27;s economy is the local university with its 12,000 students and nearly 5,000 employees in addition to many people employed at independent research facilities such as the Friedrich Loeffler Institute and spin-off firms.

Greifswald is also the seat of the diocese of the Pomeranian Evangelical Church as well as the seat of the state&#x27;s chief constitutional court, and chief financial court.

Tourism plays a vital role as Greifswald is situated between the islands of Rügen and Usedom on the popular German Baltic coast, which brings in many tourists.

One of Europe&#x27;s largest producers of photovoltaic modules, Berlin-based Solon SE, has a production site in Greifswald. The world&#x27;s third-largest producer of yachts worldwide, HanseYachts, is based in Greifswald. In the energy sector, an offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, Nord Stream 1, stops in Lubmin (near Greifswald). Riemser Arzneimittel is a pharmaceutical company based on the island of Riems, which is part of the city of Greifswald. Siemens Communications F &amp; E produces goods here as well.

In a 2008 study, Greifswald was declared Germany&#x27;s most dynamic city. According to another 2008 study, Greifswald is the &quot;youngest city&quot; in Germany having the highest percentage of heads of household under 30 years of age.

==Sightseeing==
===Medieval churches===
Among Greifswald&#x27;s brick gothic churches is the Dom St. Nikolai (St. Nicholas collegiate church) in the city center, which, with its tall tower, is the symbol of the city. The exact date of its founding is unknown, but the original church dates from the late 13th century. The tower was built, and an organ installed in the church, in the late 14th century. In the mid-17th century, when Greifswald was part of Swedish Pomerania, severe storm damage was repaired with support from the Swedish Crown. Neglect during the early DDR period necessitated extensive refurbishment, completed in 1989, the last full year of the DDR.

The St.-Marien-Kirche (St. Mary&#x27;s Church), built adjacent to the Old Town marketplace in the mid-13th century, contains ground-level brick walls four and one-half meters (14 ft) thick. Medieval murals depicting scenes from the Passion of Christ were restored in 1977–84. The church organ, known as the &quot;Marienorgel&quot; (St. Mary&#x27;s Organ), was installed by the Stralsund organ builder Friedrich Mehmel in 1866, replacing an earlier instrument. It features 37 registers.

On the west side of the Old Town stands the St.-Jacobi-Kirche (St. James&#x27;s Church), dating from the early 13th century. In 1400 it was rebuilt to contain a nave and two transepts, requiring the addition of four buttresses. The original half-timbered tower, heavily damaged in a 1955 fire, was rebuilt in brick.

===&quot;Stolpersteine&quot;===

&quot;Stolpersteine&quot;, part of the European &quot;Stolperstein&quot; (literally &quot;stumbling stone&quot;) memorial project, are scattered around Greifswald. The brass plaques, engraved with the names of Jewish residents who were murdered in the Holocaust, are embedded in the sidewalk in front of houses where they once lived. Some of the &quot;Stolpersteine&quot; in Greifswald mark the nationwide November 9, 1938, &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; pogroms in which members of the Nazi SA and SS murdered many German Jews, vandalized Jewish property and burned down synagogues – including the Greifswald Synagogue, dating from 1787. In 2012 all the 13 Stolpersteine were stolen, presumably by pro-Nazi extremists. The following year (2013) they were replaced.

A memorial plaque was installed on the site of the synagogue in 2008 in a ceremony attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

===Objects named after Holocaust perpetrators===
* Alfried Krupp Wissenschaftskolleg Greifswald (Alfried Krupp Institute for Advanced Study)
* Ferdinand Sauerbruch Street

==Transport==

According to a 2009 study, 44% of all people in Greifswald use their bicycle for daily transport within the city, which, at the time, was the highest rate in Germany. There are also public local and regional bus operators.
Local buses are run by SWG (Stadtwerke Greifswald).

Greifswald is situated at an equal distance of about to Germany&#x27;s two largest cities, Berlin and Hamburg, which can be reached via the Autobahn 20 by car in about two hours. There are also train connections to and from Hamburg (via Stralsund and Rostock), and Berlin. The popular summer tourist destinations Usedom and Rügen can be reached both by car and train.

Greifswald railway station connects Greifswald with Stralsund, Züssow, Usedom, Angermünde, Eberswalde, Berlin and Szczecin (through Pasewalk). The station is also served by ICE and EuroCity services to cities in Germany and the Czech Republic.

Greifswald has a port on the Baltic Sea as well as several marinas. The historic city centre is about off the shore, and can be reached by yachts and small boats on the river Ryck. The Bay of Greifswald is a popular place for sailing and surfing, with Germany&#x27;s two largest islands, Rügen and Usedom, just off the coast.

<text>Bostic is a town in Rutherford County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 355 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area was originally named Black Oak, before being named Bostick and eventually Bostic. It was named after George T. Bostic, a prominent businessman and member of the community. His son, William Chivous Bostic Sr., became an accomplished doctor and researcher of infectious disease.

In 1904, George W. Jones founded the Valdesian Nurseries in Bostic. The nurseries were originally situated on two acres but had expanded to two hundred acres in less than twenty years. The nursery primarily produced ornamental and rare plants for wholesale. The grounds included space for offices, storage, and greenhouses. It was located adjacent to the railroad.

The Bostic Charge Parsonage, Melton-Davis House, and Washburn Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 328 people, 136 households, and 93 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 153 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 92.99% White, 4.27% African American, 1.22% Asian, 0.30% from other races, and 1.22% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.30% of the population.

There were 136 households, out of which 35.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 52.9% were married couples living together, 11.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.9% were non-families. 27.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.41 and the average family size was 2.95.

In the town, the age distribution of the population shows 27.1% under the age of 18, 9.1% from 18 to 24, 25.0% from 25 to 44, 24.4% from 45 to 64, and 14.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 88.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.7 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $28,125, and the median income for a family was $38,750. Males had a median income of $29,375 versus $20,455 for females. The per capita income for the town was $15,454. None of the families and 4.5% of the population were living below the poverty line, including no under eighteens and 14.0% of those over 64.

==Abraham Lincoln==
Some believe that Abraham Lincoln was born on Puzzle Creek near Bostic. The Bostic Lincoln Center points to historians and Lincoln biographers that put Lincoln&#x27;s birth 5 years earlier than is commonly accepted. These histories have him born to his mother Nancy Hanks and took the name Lincoln only after Hanks moved to Kentucky with the then infant Abraham. Richard Martin and 15 other men have been named as Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s father.

==Rail==

Bostic has long been a stop for the Seaboard Air Line (later Seaboard Coast Line), now CSXT, to exchange crews with the former Clinchfield Railroad. CSXT also operates the former SAL/CRR yard, located just northwest of town. Bostic has only three caution signals and no red lights. There is a Seaboard Coast Line caboose on display at the center of town. The caboose is painted in the 1970s Family Lines System scheme.

Bostic was nearly the terminus for the Clinchfield Railroad before Spartanburg, South Carolina was chosen as the terminus.

== Notable people ==
* William Chivous Bostic Sr. prominent doctor and son of the town&#x27;s namesake
* Merle Davis Umstead served as First Lady of North Carolina
* Phil Prince, 12th president of Clemson University
* Lewis Jolley running back for the Houston Oilers

<text>Chimney Rock is a village in Rutherford County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 140 at the 2020 census. The village took its name from a large gneiss outcrop located on a summit above the village itself in Chimney Rock State Park.

==History==

A U.S. post office for Chimney Rock existed since at least 1843.

On September 27, 2024, the majority of Chimney Rock was substantially damaged by flooding caused by Hurricane Helene, with the Broad River inundating the village. The flooding also heavily damaged the adjoining town of Lake Lure.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land. The town shares a border with the town of Lake Lure. The villages of Chimney Rock and Bat Cave along with parts of Chimney Rock State Park lie within Hickory Nut Gorge. It is an incised, narrow, and relatively linear gorge likely eroded by the Broad River preferentially along either a zone of highly fractured metamorphic rock associated with a regional fault or other linear geologic feature.

==Geology==
Geological mapping by Hadley and Nelson and Robinson and others found that the Henderson Gneiss underlies the mountains, hills, and valley in the region of Chimney Rock and parts of adjacent Chimney Rock State Park. The Henderson Gneiss is a medium- to coarse-grained, generally well-foliated, biotite-microcline augen gneiss. It is finer grained and more foliated adjacent to the Brevard Fault zone and becomes coarser and less foliated towards the southeast. Where radiometrically dated, the Henderson Gneiss yielded an Rb-Sr whole-rock age of 535+27 Ma and U-Pb zircon ages of 592 and 538 Ma. Near Bat Cave, North Carolina, a couple of (Triassic ?) diorite dikes have been mapped cutting through the Henderson Gneiss west of Chimney Rock. The Henderson Gneiss lacks any cross-cutting pegmatite dikes and associated economic mineral deposits in the region of Chimney Rock and Bat Cave. The closest pegematite dikes, which lack any observed, commercial mineral deposits, occur in biotite-muscovite granitic gneiss forming the upper part of Sugarloaf Mountain.

The Chimney Rock - Hickory Nut Gorge area is part of a block of crust known now as the Tugaloo terrane. This piece of crust was a microcontinent that collided and accreted to North America during the Cambrian and early Ordovician periods. It was at this time that massive amounts of granodiorites, including the precursor plutonic rocks to the Henderson Gneiss, intruded into metasedimentary rocks at approximately 448 Ma. During this and later times, the rocks of the Tugaloo terrane experienced multiple periods intense folding, faulting, and metamorphism. Between 390 and 340 Ma, the granodiorites were altered by a period of intense metamorphism and thrust faulting to form the Henderson Gneiss and the gently dipping northeast-southwest trending foliation and folding associated with it.

During the post-Paleozoic, stresses caused by the uplift, erosion, and decompression of the Henderson Gneiss fractured it into orthogonal, sub-vertical joints. The timing of formation of these joints is poorly constrained. They typically occur as west-northwest - east-southeast and north-northeast - south-southwest systematic set of joints. These joint sets lie parallel and perpendicular to the Hickory Nut Gorge and define the rectilinear drainage networks. Because of a regional humid climate and steep gorge walls composed of systematically jointed and fractured bedrock, Hickory Nut Gorge has a long record of historical landslide events. These events include those in 1916, 1994, 1996, 2008, 2012, 2013, and 2018 as documented in the North Carolina Geological Survey&#x27;s &quot;Western North Carolina Landslide Hazard Viewer&quot;. The presence of extensive rock boulder and block deposits at the base the gorge&#x27;s wall show that debris flows and rock falls have been active along the steep gorge walls throughout the Quaternary.

== Government ==
Chimney Rock Village is governed by a five-member council. Council members serve four-year staggered terms. They are elected at large in non-partisan contests determined by plurality, with the person receiving the highest number of votes elected to the open seats. The council selects a mayor from among its members after each of its own elections. The village retains an administrator and a staff responsible to the council to carry out governmental functions.

==History==

Ellenboro is a town in Rutherford County.

In 1880, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad built a line from Wilmington to Rutherfordton. At the highest point on that line, the town of Ellenboro sprang up. In 1884, as the community of 179 people was trying to decide on a name for the town, Seaboard engineer John Robinson proposed that it be named for his daughter, Ellen, who was dying of a fever. In return, Robinson donated a large brass bell to the town. The bell hung for many years in the school, but disappeared some time after a new school building was built.

In those early days, the most important social event of the year was held in early July and was known as &quot;Big Days.&quot; Big Days celebrations drew crowds from miles around (as pictured above in a turn of the century photo, showing a prize-winning wagon load of revelers). The festivities included a steam-powered merry-go-round, sack races, foot races, minstrel shows, side shows, produce sales, and lemonade dipped from zinc tubs.

In 1928, a young agriculture teacher at Ellenboro School, A.B. Bushong, organized the first Colfax Free Fair held in early fall on the school grounds, providing an opportunity for farmers and homemakers to display their best efforts of the year: canned and baked goods, crops, and handicrafts. Students also proudly exhibited their work competing for ribbons. Beauty and baby contests were held. A major part of the fair (especially for the children) was the rides provided every year by Lee Rides. Over the years, the fair, still held every September, has become a time for former students and Ellenboro residents who may have moved away to come home and visit with friends and to catch up on the year&#x27;s news.

<doc id="128212" wikidata="Q303620" url="?curid=128212" title="Lake Lure, North Carolina">
<text>Lake Lure is a town in Rutherford County, North Carolina, United States. In 2020 the town population was 1,365. Lake Lure was incorporated in 1927, and acquired the lake after which it is named in 1965.

==History==
In 1902, Dr. Lucius B. Morse and his brothers Hiram and Asahel purchased around Chimney Rock (within present-day Chimney Rock State Park) for $5,000. They later acquired enough land in the area to bring the total to . Lucius Morse&#x27;s wife Elizabeth is credited with naming the lake (and the town). Included in the area that became the lake, according to a blog entry by Russ Meade, was the town of Buffalo, believed to have been named for a nearby mountain that resembled a buffalo.

In 1925, the Morse family created Carolina Mountain Power Company and funded the construction of a dam on the Broad River (through a mortgage) which produced the lake after which the town is named. The full impoundment of Lake Lure was completed in 1927. At ordinary water levels, Lake Lure covers approximately and has a shoreline of approximately . The dam&#x27;s power plant began operations in 1928 with the sale of electricity under a 10-year contract to Blue Ridge Power Co., a local predecessor of Duke Power. In modern times, the town continues to sell electricity to Duke Energy, although profits from the dam now come second to maintaining a fixed water level year-round.

In 1929, the plans for development came to a halt with the advent of the Great Depression. A mortgage-holder, Stroud &amp; Company of Philadelphia, foreclosed on the lake and the dam. Stroud owned them and the power the dam generated until 1965. In 1963, the North Carolina General Assembly enacted the legislation that authorized the Town of Lake Lure to issue revenue bonds for the purpose of acquiring the assets from Stroud. The dam, power company, and real estate of Lake Lure were acquired by the Town of Lake Lure in 1965.

On September 27, 2024, the town, along with the neighboring village of Chimney Rock, suffered catastrophic damage from flooding caused by Tropical Storm Helene, including the destruction of the historic Lake Lure Flowering Bridge and the attached Rainbow Bridge. The amount of rainfall from the storm prompted the issuance of a flash flood emergency by the National Weather Service and evacuation orders from local authorities due to water overtopping the dam and the risk of the structure failing. However, while the dam&#x27;s structural supports had been damaged, its wall remained stable.

===Tourism===

Recreation and tourism have become crucial to the town&#x27;s economy; challenges to this industry have included the Party Rock wildfire and the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 1999, Pine Gables was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

Lake Lure was a primary filming location for &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;, and hosts an annual festival event honoring the movie.

Located on Memorial Highway, The Right Track Toy Train Museum, opened in 2011, features a large display of toy train memorabilia previously belonging to Larry Keyes. Larry&#x27;s widow, Peggy, opened the museum to honor her late husband, and 100% of the museum&#x27;s proceeds are donated to pancreatic cancer research.

The Rocky Broad River Bridge, built in 1925 and closed to traffic in 2011, re-opened as the Lake Lure Flowering Bridge in 2013, with gardens spanning the span of the bridge and expanding. Prior to the grand opening, the tourist attraction had already been visited by tourists from 36 states and 14 countries. Referred to as &quot;The Gateway to Somewhere Beautiful&quot;, the Flowering Bridge featured garden beds, a mobile phone tour, a Sensory Tour for visually-impaired guests, and the Rainbow Bridge, which served as a memorial for the deceased pets of visitors. It had been recognized by the National Wildlife Federation as a Certified Wildlife Habitat and met the criteria to be designated as a Monarch Waystation by Monarch Watch. The bridge was briefly closed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On September 27, 2024, the bridge was severely damaged and the gardens mostly destroyed due to flooding caused by Tropical Storm Helene; as of December 2024, clean-up and assessment are in progress.
