<text>The Last Emperor () is a 1987 epic biographical drama film about the life of Puyi, the last Emperor of China. It is directed by Bernardo Bertolucci from a screenplay he co-wrote with Mark Peploe, which was adapted from Puyi&#x27;s 1964 autobiography, and independently produced by Jeremy Thomas.

The film depicts Puyi&#x27;s life from his ascent to the throne as an infant to his imprisonment and political rehabilitation by the Chinese Communist Party. It stars John Lone in the eponymous role, with Peter O&#x27;Toole, Joan Chen, Ruocheng Ying, Victor Wong, Dennis Dun, Vivian Wu, Lisa Lu, and Ryuichi Sakamoto (who also composed the film score with David Byrne and Cong Su). It was the first Western feature film authorised by the People&#x27;s Republic of China to film in the Forbidden City in Beijing.

&quot;The Last Emperor&quot; premiered at the 1987 Tokyo International Film Festival, and was released in the United States by Columbia Pictures on November 18. It earned widespread positive reviews from critics and was also a commercial success. At the 60th Academy Awards, it won all nine Oscars it was nominated for, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. It also won several other accolades, including three BAFTA Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, nine David di Donatello Awards, and a Grammy Award for its musical score. The film was converted into 3D and shown in the Cannes Classics section at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.

==Plot==
By 1950, the 44-year-old Puyi, former Emperor of China, has been in custody for five years since his capture by the Red Army during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. In the recently established People&#x27;s Republic of China, Puyi arrives as a political prisoner and war criminal at the Fushun Prison. Soon after his arrival, Puyi attempts suicide, but is quickly rescued and told he must stand trial.

42 years earlier, in 1908, a toddler Puyi is summoned to the Forbidden City by the dying Empress Dowager Cixi. After telling him that the previous emperor had died earlier that day, Cixi tells Puyi that he is to be the next emperor. After his coronation, Puyi, frightened by his new surroundings, repeatedly expresses his wish to go home, but is denied. Despite having scores of palace eunuchs and maids to wait on him, his only real friend is his wet nurse, Ar Mo.

As he grows up, his upbringing is confined entirely to the imperial palace and he is prohibited from leaving. One day, he is visited by his younger brother, Pujie, who tells him he is no longer Emperor and that China has become a republic; that same day, Ar Mo is forced to leave. In 1919, Reginald Johnston is appointed as Puyi&#x27;s tutor and gives him a Western-style education, and Puyi becomes increasingly desirous to leave the Forbidden City. Johnston, wary of the courtiers&#x27; expensive lifestyle, convinces Puyi that the best way of achieving this is through marriage; Puyi subsequently weds Wanrong, with Wenxiu as a secondary consort.

Puyi then sets about reforming the Forbidden City, including expelling the palace eunuchs. However, in 1924, he himself is expelled from the palace and exiled to Tientsin following the Beijing Coup. He leads a decadent life as a playboy and Anglophile, and sides with Japan after the Mukden Incident. During this time, Wenxiu divorces him, but Wanrong remains and eventually succumbs to opium addiction. In 1934, the Japanese crown him &quot;Emperor&quot; of their puppet state of Manchukuo, though his supposed political supremacy is undermined at every turn. Wanrong gives birth to an illegitimate child, but the baby is murdered at birth by the Japanese and proclaimed stillborn. She is then taken to a clinic where her physical and mental state declines even further. Puyi remains the nominal ruler of the region until Japan&#x27;s capitulation. He decides to surrender to the Americans but before he can leave, he is captured by the Soviet Red Army and handed over to the Chinese.

Under the Communist re-education program for political prisoners, Puyi is coerced by his interrogators to formally renounce his forced collaboration with the Japanese invaders during the Second Sino-Japanese War. After heated discussions with Jin Yuan, the warden of the Fushun Prison, and watching a film detailing the wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese, Puyi eventually recants and is considered rehabilitated by the government; he is subsequently released in 1959.

Several years later in 1967, Puyi has become a simple gardener who lives a peasant proletarian existence following the rise of Mao Zedong&#x27;s cult of personality and the Cultural Revolution. On his way home from work, he happens upon a Red Guard parade, celebrating the rejection of landlordism by the communists. He sees Jin Yuan, now one of the political prisoners punished as an anti-revolutionary in the parade, forced to wear a dunce cap and a sandwich board bearing punitive slogans.

Puyi later visits the Forbidden City, now turned into a museum, where he meets an assertive young boy wearing the red scarf of the Pioneer Movement. The boy orders Puyi to step away from the throne, but Puyi proves that he was indeed the Son of Heaven before approaching the throne. Behind it, Puyi finds a 60-year-old pet cricket that he was given by palace official Chen Baochen on his coronation day and gives it to the child. Amazed by the gift, the boy turns to talk to Puyi, but finds that he has disappeared.

In 1987, a tour guide leads a group through the palace. Stopping in front of the throne, the guide sums up Puyi&#x27;s life in a few, brief sentences, before concluding that he died in 1967.

==Cast==
Other cast members include Chen Kaige as the Captain of the Imperial Guard, Hideo Takamatsu as General Takashi Hishikari, Hajime Tachibana as the General&#x27;s translator, Zhang Liangbin as the eunuch Big Foot, Huang Wenjie as the eunuch Hunchback, Chen Shu as Zhang Jinghui, Cheng Shuyan as Hiro Saga, Li Fusheng as Xie Jieshi, and Constantine Gregory as the Emperor&#x27;s oculist.

==Production==
===Development===
Bernardo Bertolucci proposed the film to the Chinese government as one of two possible projects – the other was an adaptation of &quot;La Condition humaine&quot; (&quot;Man&#x27;s Fate&quot;) by André Malraux. The Chinese preferred &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;. Producer Jeremy Thomas managed to raise the $25 million budget for his ambitious independent production single-handedly. At one stage, he scoured the phone book for potential financiers. Bertolucci was given complete freedom by the authorities to shoot in the Forbidden City, which had never before been opened up for use in a Western film. For the first ninety minutes of the film, Bertolucci and Storaro made full use of its visual splendour.

===Filming===
19,000 extras were needed over the course of the film. The People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) was drafted in to accommodate.

In a 2010 interview with Bilge Ebiri for Vulture.com, Bertolucci recounted the shooting of the Cultural Revolution scene:

=== Historical accuracy ===
British historian Alex von Tunzelmann wrote that the movie considerably downplays and misrepresents the Emperor&#x27;s cruelty, especially during his youth. As stated by Tunzelmann and Behr (author of the 1987 book &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;), Puyi engaged in sadistic abuse of palace servants and subordinates during his initial reign well in excess of what Bertolucci&#x27;s movie portrays, frequently having eunuchs beaten for mild transgressions or no reason at all; in a demonstrative example, the young Emperor once conspired to force a eunuch to eat a cake full of iron filings simply to see the eunuch&#x27;s reaction, which he was talked out of by his beloved wet nurse with some difficulty. Tunzelmann states that most people worldwide who have heard of Puyi are likely to have an incorrect understanding of this aspect of the Emperor&#x27;s reign, as the movie is much more popular globally than more accurate biographies. 

The film contains several other historical inaccuracies: in real life, Puyi left the Forbidden City when his mother died; as he recounts in his memoirs, he did not have sex with his wives; Puyi actually stopped the Japanese from killing the Empress&#x27;s lover rather than let him be murdered; although the film mentions the Beijing Coup, it erroneously claims that the president fled the capital instead of being put under house arrest; the testimonies that Puyi gives to his Chinese interrogators were in fact given at the Tokyo Trials.

Jeremy Thomas recalled the approval process for the screenplay with the Chinese government: &quot;It was less difficult than working with the studio system. They made script notes and made references to change some of the names, then the stamp went on and the door opened and we came.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

While not included on the album soundtrack, the following music was played in the film: &quot;Am I Blue?&quot; (1929), &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; (uncredited), and &quot;China Boy&quot; (1922, uncredited). The Northeastern Cradle Song was sung by Ar Mo twice in the film.

==Release==
Hemdale Film Corporation acquired all North American distribution rights to the film on behalf of producer Thomas, who raised a large sum of the budget himself. Hemdale, in turn, licensed theatrical rights to Columbia Pictures, who were initially reluctant to release it, and only after shooting was completed did the head of Columbia agree to distribute &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; in North America. 

&quot;The Last Emperor&quot; opened in 19 theatres in Italy and grossed $265,000 in its first weekend. It expanded to 65 theatres in its second weekend and 93 in its third, increasing its weekend gross to $763,000 and grossing $2 million in its first 16 days. Six days after its Italian opening, it opened in Germany and grossed $473,000 in its first weekend from 50 theatres and $1.1 million in its first 10 days. The film had an unusual run in US theatres. It did not enter the weekend box office top 10 until its twelfth week in which the film reached number 7 after increasing its gross by 168% from the previous week and more than tripling its theatre count (this was the weekend before it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture). Following that week, the film lingered around the top 10 for 8 weeks before peaking at number 4 in its 22nd week (the weekend after winning the Oscar), increasing its weekend gross by 306% and nearly doubling its theatre count from 460 to 877, and spending 6 more weeks in the weekend box office top 10. Were it not for this late push, &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; would have joined &quot;The English Patient&quot;, &quot;Amadeus&quot;, and &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; as the only Best Picture winners to not enter the weekend box office top 5 since these numbers were first recorded in 1982.

The film was converted into 3D and shown in the Cannes Classics section at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 124 reviews, with an average rating of 8.10/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;While Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s decadent epic never quite identifies the dramatic pulse of its protagonist, stupendous visuals and John Lone&#x27;s ability to make passivity riveting give &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; a rarified grandeur.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 76 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A-&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert was notably enthusiastic in his praise of the film, awarding it four out of four: &quot;Bertolucci is able to make Pu Yi&#x27;s imprisonment seem all the more ironic because this entire film was shot on location inside the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and he was even given permission to film inside the Forbidden City — a vast, medieval complex covering some and containing 9,999 rooms (only heaven, the Chinese believed, had 10,000 rooms). It probably is unforgivably bourgeois to admire a film because of its locations, but in the case of &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; the narrative cannot be separated from the awesome presence of the Forbidden City, and from Bertolucci&#x27;s astonishing use of locations, authentic costumes, and thousands of extras to create the everyday reality of this strange little boy.&quot;

Jonathan Rosenbaum compared &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; favorably to Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;: &quot;At best, apart from a few snapshots, &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; teaches us something about the inside of one director&#x27;s brain. &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; incidentally and secondarily does that too; but it also teaches us something about the lives of a billion people with whom we share this planet—and better yet, makes us want to learn still more about them.&quot;

=== Editing out of Rape of Nanking scene for Japan ===
The Shochiku Fuji Company edited out a thirty-second sequence depicting the Rape of Nanjing before distributing it to Japanese theatres. Bertolucci had not given his consent for the cut, and was furious at the interference with his film, which he called &quot;revolting&quot;. The company quickly restored the scene, blaming &quot;confusion and misunderstanding&quot; for the edit while opining that the Rape sequence was &quot;too sensational&quot; for Japanese moviegoers.

===Home media===
Hemdale licensed its video rights to Nelson Entertainment, which released the film on VHS and Laserdisc. The film also received a Laserdisc release in Australia in 1992, through Columbia Tri-Star Video. Years later, Artisan Entertainment acquired the rights to the film and released both the theatrical and extended versions on home video. In February 2008 The Criterion Collection (under license from now-rights-holder Thomas) released a four disc Director-Approved edition, again containing both theatrical and extended versions. Criterion released a Blu-ray version on 6 January 2009.

==Accolades==
==Alternative versions==
The film&#x27;s theatrical release ran 163 minutes. Deemed too long to show in a single three-hour block on television but too short to spread out over two nights, an extended version was created which runs 218 minutes. Cinematographer Vittorio Storaro and director Bernardo Bertolucci have confirmed that this extended version was indeed created as a television miniseries and does not represent a true &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot;.

== Home video ==
The Criterion Collection 2008 version of four DVDs adds commentary by Ian Buruma, composer David Byrne, and the Director&#x27;s interview with Jeremy Isaacs (). It includes a booklet featuring an essay by David Thomson, interviews with production designer Ferdinando Scarfiotti and actor Ying Ruocheng, a reminiscence by Bertolucci, and an essay and production-diary extracts from Fabien S. Gerard.

The film was for quite some time unavailable on DVD or Blu-Ray in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio, as cinematographer Vittorio Storaro had insisted on a cropped 2:1 version that retroactively conforms the film to his Univisium standard. Copies of the film in its original ratio were then rare and sought after by fans of the film.

The film has since been restored in 4K and in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio, and has been released on Blu-ray and UHD in 2023 in several countries using this 4K restoration.

<doc id="129248" wikidata="Q715136" url="?curid=129248" title="Pan-Green Coalition">
<text>The Pan-Green coalition, Pan-Green force or Pan-Green groups is a nationalist political coalition in Taiwan (Republic of China), consisting of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Taiwan Statebuilding Party (TSP), Social Democratic Party (SDP), Green Party Taiwan, Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), and Taiwan Constitution Association (TCA). The platform of the New Power Party is also very closely aligned with all the other Pan-Green parties.

== History ==
The name comes from the colours of the Democratic Progressive Party, which originally adopted green in part because of its association with the anti-nuclear movement. In contrast to the Pan-Blue Coalition, the Pan-Green Coalition favors Taiwanization and Taiwan independence over Chinese unification, although members in both coalitions have moderated their policies to reach voters in the center.

This strategy is helped by the fact that much of the motivation that voters have for voting for one party or the other are for reasons that have nothing to do with relations with China. This is particularly true among swing voters. For much of the 1990s, the parties which later formed the Pan-Green Coalition greatly benefited because they were less corrupt than the ruling Kuomintang (KMT). However, due to the controversies and the alleged corruption cases involving the former DPP nominated President Chen Shui-bian, the public perception of the Coalition is seemed to have been altered somewhat.

The Pan-Green Coalition formed in the aftermath of the 2000 presidential election, after which Lee Teng-hui was expelled from the Kuomintang and created his own party, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, which maintains a pro-independence platform.

Unlike the internal dynamics of the Pan-Blue Coalition, which consist of relatively equal-sized parties with very similar ideologies, the Pan-Green Coalition contains the DPP, which is much larger and more moderate than the TSU. So rather than coordinating electoral strategies, the presence of the TSU keeps the DPP from moving too far away from its Taiwan independence roots. In local elections, competition tends to be fierce between Pan-Green candidates from different parties, and as a rule, joint candidates are not proposed.

The Green Party Taiwan is not considered as part of the Pan-Green Coalition, but the Green Party has similar views with the Democratic Progressive Party, especially on environmental and social issues, and the Green Party is also allied with the Social Democratic Party.

<doc id="129249" wikidata="Q1350503" url="?curid=129249" title="Pan-Blue Coalition">
<text>The Pan-Blue coalition, Pan-Blue force or Pan-Blue groups is a political coalition in the Republic of China (Taiwan) consisting of the Kuomintang (KMT), People First Party (PFP), New Party (CNP), Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU), and Young China Party (YCP). The name comes from the party color of the Kuomintang.

Regarding the political status of Taiwan, the coalition maintains that the Republic of China instead of the People&#x27;s Republic of China is the legitimate government of China. It also favors a Chinese and Taiwanese dual identity over an exclusive Taiwanese identity and backs greater friendly exchange with Mainland China, as opposed to the Pan-Green Coalition.

== Political stance ==
The Pan-Blue Coalition&#x27;s political stance can be characterized as centre-right, conservative and being of Republic of China-centered Chinese nationalism.

Originally, the Pan-Blue Coalition was associated with Chinese unification, but has moved towards a more conservative position supporting the present status quo, while rejecting immediate unification with mainland China. It now argues that reunification is possible only after the communist regime in mainland China collapses or transitions to a democracy either as a new democratic government or with the re-establishment of Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Republic of China government which fled to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War. This would also allow the body of Chiang Kai-shek to be returned to his ancestral home in Xikou.

== History ==

=== Lee Teng-hui presidency: 1988–2000 ===
Throughout the 1990s, the Kuomintang (KMT) consisted of an uneasy relationship between those party members who had mainland China backgrounds (came from mainland China in 1949) and Taiwanese political elites, Taiwanese factions led by President Lee Teng-hui, who supported a stronger Taiwanese identity and distinction from Chinese nationalism. Lee won the party control after the indirect election in 1990. This led to a split in the early 1990s, when the New Party was formed by the anti-Lee dissidents in the KMT. After the dissidents of KMT members left, the KMT remained loyal and with control by President Lee Teng-hui throughout his presidency.

During the 2000 presidential election, Lee Teng-hui arranged for Lien Chan to be nominated as Kuomintang candidate for president rather than the more popular James Soong, who left the party and formed his own People First Party after both he and Lien were defeated by Chen Shui-bian in the presidential elections. Though Chen and the DPP won the presidency, pro-KMT lawmakers held 140 out of 225 seats in the Legislative Yuan. Soong and Lien later formed a coalition in opposition to the DPP minority government.

=== First time in opposition: 2000–2008 ===
In the 2000 presidential election itself, the split in Kuomintang votes between Soong and Lien led in part to the election of Chen Shui-bian. After the election, there was widespread anger within the Kuomintang against Lee Teng-hui, who was expelled for forming his own pro-Taiwan independence party, the Taiwan Solidarity Union. After Lee&#x27;s expulsion, the Kuomintang moved its policies back to a more conservative one and began informal but close cooperation with the People First Party and the New Party. This coalition became informally known as the Pan-Blue Coalition. Although the members of the Pan-Blue Coalition maintain separate party structures, they closely cooperate in large part to ensure that electoral strategies are coordinated, so that votes are not split among them leading to a victory by the Pan-Green Coalition.

The KMT and PFP ran a combined ticket in the 2004 presidential elections with Lien Chan running for president and James Soong running for vice president. The campaign emblem for the Lien-Soong campaign was a two-seat bicycle with a blue (the color of the KMT) figure in the first seat and an orange (the color of the PFP) figure in the second.

There were talks in late 2004 that the KMT and the PFP would merge into one party in 2005, but these talks have been put on hold. In the 2004 legislative election the three parties from the pan-blue coalition organized themselves to properly divide up the votes () to prevent splitting the vote. The New Party ran all but one of its candidates under the KMT banner. The result was that the KMT gained 11 more seats and the PFP lost 12 seats. Right after the election, PFP chairman James Soong began criticizing the KMT for sacrificing the PFP for its own gains and stated that he would not participate in any negotiations regarding to the two parties&#x27; merge. Soong&#x27;s remarks have been strongly criticized by the KMT, a majority of PFP members, and the New Party, whose rank and file were largely absorbed by the PFP following the 2001 elections. Nonetheless, shortly after the legislative election, the PFP legislative caucus agreed to cooperate with the DPP over the investigation into the KMT&#x27;s finances. On 24 February 2005, James Soong met with President Chen for the first time in four years and issued a 10-point declaration supporting the name &quot;Republic of China&quot;, the status quo in cross-strait relations, and the opening of the Three Links. Unlike Soong, Lien did not respond to the offer from Chen to meet.

However, after the 2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China, Soong and Chen stopped their partnership. The popular Taipei mayor Ma Ying-jeou was also elected the new head of the Kuomintang, and was considered the leading contender for the KMT nomination in the 2008 presidential election. However, it was uncertain whether the KMT and PFP could agree to field a common ticket. On the 2005 chairmanship election, Soong had made a televised endorsement of Ma&#x27;s opponent Wang Jin-pyng.

In the December 2005 3-in-1 local elections, the KMT made large gains and held 14 seats, the DPP suffered defeat and held only six, the PFP retained only one, and the TSU was completely shut out. Ma Ying-jeou was now virtually assured of leading the KMT and pan-blues for the 2008 presidential election.

=== Ma Ying-jeou presidency: 2008–2016 ===
In the 2008 legislative election, the coalition won 86 of 113 seats in the Legislative Yuan, giving it the supermajority needed to recall the president and pass constitutional amendments for a referendum. The KMT, PFP, and NP coordinated their candidate lists in the new single-member constituency system. Candidates of the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union, who despite their party&#x27;s official stance of non-affiliation, were deemed sympathetic to the coalition and ran unopposed by other blue candidates in almost all the seats it contested. The PFP ran almost all of their candidates under the KMT banner, with some placed under the KMT party list. While having all its district candidates run under the KMT banner, the New Party ran its own party list but failed to gain the 5% threshold for representation. The Kuomintang controlled the Legislative Yuan during the Ma Ying-jeou presidency from 2008 to 2016.

=== In opposition during Tsai Ing-wen presidency: 2016–2024 ===
In 2016 general election, the KMT lost the presidential election and, for the first time in the history of the Republic of China, the control in the Legislative Yuan. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took control of the legislature for the first time, winning the presidency. The KMT became the largest opposition party. The PFP&#x27;s leader James Soong, despite being a member of the coalition, cooperated with Tsai Ing-wen&#x27;s administration, becoming the representative of Chinese Taipei in the APEC summit.

=== In opposition during Lai Ching-te presidency: 2024–present ===
Although Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) (known as the &quot;white camp&quot;) positions itself as a centrist party, its cooperative relationship with the KMT has prompted belief that it aligns more closely with the Pan-Blue camp. Prior to the 2024 presidential election, prospects for ‘blue-white cooperation’ had been met with optimism from both parties, as they sought to jointly minimise the DPP’s chances of procuring a third consecutive term of presidency. The two opposition parties then engaged in negotiations to form a joint presidential ticket in November 2023, with the proposal that either the KMT’s Hou Yu-ih or the TPP’s Ko Wen-je would be selected as the presidential candidate and the other the vice-presidential candidate.

During this period, polls from Mirror Media indicated that support rates for both Ko-Hou ticket and Hou-Ko ticket would outperform their Lai-Hsiao counterpart, standing at 46.6% and 46.5% respectively. However, the alliance subsequently collapsed on 18 November following the disagreement over the selection method for the presidential and vice-presidential candidates, resulting in both Hou and Ko entering the race as separate presidential candidates. The division among Hou and Ko’s overlapping support bases eventually led to vote-splitting, culminating in their defeat and the victory of DPP’s Lai Ching-te, who holds dissimilar ideology with the other two candidates in major issues such as national defence and the view on the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement. But since Ko and Hou together secured 60% of the votes, Lai would likely not have won had the deal succeeded.

Despite this setback, an opposition coalition has still been established between the two parties in the Legislative Yuan since February 2024, forming a majority against the DPP’s minority government. The two parties have since cooperated in numerous bill amendments, including the Act Governing the Legislative Yuan’s Power, Act Governing the Allocation of Government Revenues and Expenditures, and others.

<text>Garry Marshall Shider (July 24, 1953 – June 16, 2010) was an American musician and guitarist. He was musical director of the P-Funk All-Stars for much of their history. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, with fifteen other members of Parliament-Funkadelic.

==Early life==
Shider was born in Plainfield, New Jersey. At the age of ten and under the guidance of his father Jesse, Garry and his brothers played and sang behind many gospel artists of the time including legends such as Shirley Caesar, The Five Blind Boys, The Mighty Clouds of Joy, and others. As a youth Shider was also a regular customer at the Plainfield barbershop owned by George Clinton, where the future members of Parliament would sing doo-wop for customers and counsel local youngsters. Clinton made note of the young Shider&#x27;s talents on guitar and his ability with gospel singing.

By the time he was sixteen, Shider wished to escape the crime and dead-end prospects of Plainfield, so he and his friend Cordell &quot;Boogie&quot; Mosson left for Canada where Shider married and had a son. Shider and Mosson formed a funk/rock band called United Soul, or &quot;U.S.&quot;. George Clinton was living in Toronto at the time and began hearing about United Soul from people in the local music business, and took the band under his wing upon learning that Shider was a member.

==Career==
In 1971, Clinton produced several tracks by United Soul with input from members of Funkadelic. The songs &quot;I Miss My Baby&quot; and &quot;Baby I Owe You Something Good&quot; were released as a one-off single by Westbound Records in 1971 under the group name U.S. Music with Funkadelic. All the tracks recorded with Clinton in 1971 were released by Westbound in 2009 as the album &quot;U.S. Music With Funkadelic&quot;. After producing United Soul, Clinton then invited Shider and Mosson to join Parliament-Funkadelic. Two United Soul songs were rerecorded on later Funkadelic albums with Shider as a member. Clinton groomed Shider for an important role in the P-Funk roster, which Shider joined full-time in 1972. He was a prominent contributor to albums by both Parliament and Funkadelic until the dissolution of those two bands in the early 1980s, after which he continued to work regularly with Clinton&#x27;s P-Funk All-Stars.

During Parliament-Funkadelic performances, Shider was known for appearing in a diaper, making him instantly recognizable on stage and earning him the nickname &quot;Diaper Man&quot;. Shider is featured prominently in many hit songs like &quot;Cosmic Slop,&quot; &quot;Getting to Know You,&quot; and &quot;One Nation Under a Groove&quot;. He co-wrote many noteworthy Parliament-Funkadelic songs, and he made important contributions to P-Funk spin-off acts including Bootsy Collins and Eddie Hazel.

Shider has been featured in Guitar Player Magazine three times, and once in the Japanese version. He has been featured in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Music&quot; and appeared on a compilation album by Paul Shaffer of the David Letterman band, and also on rock group The Black Crowes&#x27; 1996 album &quot;Three Snakes and One Charm&quot;. Shider has also appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; several times, the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, &quot;New York Undercover&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and others. He appeared in the films &quot;PCU&quot; and &quot;The Night Before&quot;; both of which included songs he wrote and performed. He has also had songs featured in the film &quot;Bad Boys&quot;, with Sean Penn, as well as being the recipient of several Grammy nominations for songs like &quot;Stomp&quot; by Kirk Franklin, which used &quot;One Nation Under a Groove&quot; as its musical inspiration. The song won Song of the Year at the GMA Dove Awards.

Shider released a solo single in 1988 entitled &quot;Beautiful&quot;. The attempt to reconcile P-Funk&#x27;s distinct sound with that of late-80s synthpop yielded no chart success. He released two full albums in 2002, &quot;Diaper Man, The Second Coming&quot; and &quot;Diaperman Goes Starchild&quot;.

Shider was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997 as a prominent member of Parliament-Funkadelic.

==Death==
In 2010, it was announced that Shider was suffering from cancer of the brain and lungs. On June 16, 2010, Shider died from complications of his cancer at his home in Greater Upper Marlboro, Maryland. He is survived by his two sons, as well as his wife, Linda Shider, a singer and songwriter.

<text>Bexley is a city in Franklin County, Ohio, United States. The population was 13,928 at the 2020 census. The city is a suburban enclave of Columbus, situated on the banks of Alum Creek east of Columbus&#x27;s Near East Side. It was founded in 1908 as a merger between the Bullitt Park neighborhood and Pleasant Ridge community, which met at the National Road (Main Street) which bisects the city.

Capital University and Trinity Lutheran Seminary are based in Bexley. The city is home to large estates, including the Ohio Governor&#x27;s Mansion and the Jeffrey Park Mansion ( &quot;Kelveden&quot;), the home of the president of Ohio State University.

==History==

Bexley was named at the suggestion of an early resident, Col. Lincoln Kilbourne, in honor of his family&#x27;s roots in Bexley, in London, England. The village of Bexley was incorporated in 1908 when prominent citizens of Bullitt Park to the north along Alum Creek, including industrialist and 35th mayor of Columbus Robert H. Jeffrey, agreed to merge with the Lutheran community of Pleasant Ridge to the south near the Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio college, Capital University (established 1850) and the Evangelical Lutheran Theological Seminary (now Trinity Lutheran Seminary) founded 1830. Both educational institutions today are affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

Bullitt Park had been founded in 1889, when Logan M. Bullitt of Philadelphia submitted his first plat for the area. Wealthy citizens of Columbus continued to build urban townhouses and country homes to the east along Broad Street and Town Road (now Bryden Road), extending to Franklin Park. By the 1890s, several large homes were erected across Alum Creek in the Bullitt Park area, one of which became the original campus of the Columbus School for Girls, still an exclusive girls&#x27; private school in Bexley.

The onset of the Spanish–American War was also instrumental in Bexley&#x27;s history. In 1898, Ohio Governor Asa Bushnell chose a cluster of unsold lots around Broad and Drexel in Bullitt Park as an assembly site for state volunteers for the war. Camp Bushnell, as it was known, was home for three weeks to 8,000 Ohio recruits headed for Cuba. This led to the development of water and sewer lines for the soldiers, thus preparing the area for later real estate development in subsequent decades.

By 1908, the residents of Bullitt Park, north of Main Street, and Pleasant Ridge, south of Main Street, decided to merge their neighborhoods and incorporated as the Village of Bexley. The village reached the 5,000 population mark required by the state of Ohio to become a city in 1928 and, on January 1, 1932, officially became a city. William A. Schneider was elected the first mayor in 1935. Schneider oversaw construction of the first city hall and led Bexley through a long and profitable growth period. He remained in office for 32 years before retiring.

In March 2013, the city of Bexley was accredited as an arboretum by the Morton Register of Arboreta, making it the first city in the United States to successfully obtain arboretum accreditation.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, the city has a total area of , of which (or 99.18%) is land and (or 0.82%) is water.

==Demographics==
Bexley is informally divided into three sections: North Bexley, consisting of the neighborhoods north of Broad Street; Central Bexley, the area between Main Street and Broad Street; and South Bexley, the area between Main Street and Livingston Avenue. The demographics of these three sections are distinct. North Bexley, particularly the Bullitt Park area comprising roughly the western half of North Bexley, is an area of large, mansion-like homes. Central Bexley consists primarily of large homes of between 2,000 and 4,500 square feet, and many residents are white-collar professionals characteristic of the upper middle class. South Bexley contains smaller homes, many of which have less than 1,500 square feet. Clerical and trades workers, as well as young professionals with small children, are more easily found among South Bexley residents, and the neighborhood would be seen as exhibiting many characteristics of the middle class.

Bexley is a community of primarily white residents with above-average resources. A plurality of Bexley residents are adherents of Mainline Protestant denominations. The city is home to two Lutheran (ELCA) churches, a United Methodist church and an Episcopal church, and not far outside of the city may be found three Presbyterian churches. Bexley contains many Jewish residents and is home to three synagogues (Agudas Achim, Ahavas Sholom and Torat Emet). The city also has a significant number of Roman Catholic residents, and three Roman Catholic churches are located just outside Bexley&#x27;s borders. While still a small minority of residents, African-American and mixed-race families are becoming increasingly prominent in the community.

Bexley has grown increasingly progressive both politically and socially in the 21st century, a trend shared by other inner-ring suburbs in Franklin County.

<text>Gahanna is a city in northeastern Franklin County, Ohio, United States. It is a suburb of Columbus. The population was 35,726 at the 2020 census. It was founded in 1849.

==History==

Gahanna was founded along the Big Walnut Creek in 1849 by John Clark of Ross County from of land that his father, Joseph Clark, had purchased from Governor Worthington in 1814. Clark named his property the Gahanna Plantation, from which the City of Gahanna derives its name. The name Gahanna is derived from a Native American word for three creeks joining into one and is the former name of the Big Walnut Creek. The City of Gahanna&#x27;s Official Seal refers to this confluence of three creeks with the inscription &quot;Three In One&quot;.

Gahanna maintained a considerable rivalry with the adjacent village of Bridgeport. Located directly across Granville Street from Gahanna and also along the banks of the Big Walnut Creek, Bridgeport was founded in 1853 by Jesse Baughman, a former Franklin County Commissioner. The two villages eventually put aside their differences and merged into one. They adopted the name Gahanna as there was already another village in Ohio called Bridgeport. In March 1881, 55 citizens of Gahanna petitioned Franklin County to incorporate the village. The incorporation was granted in June and was recorded on August 8, 1881. The now-incorporated village then held its first mayoral election and on October 6, 1881, swore in its first mayor, L. John Neiswander.

On January 7, 1994, United Express Flight 6291 crashed in Gahanna, killing five of the eight people on board.

==Economy==
In recent years, Gahanna has worked hard at revitalizing the downtown &quot;Olde Gahanna&quot; section of the city. In October 2004, Gahanna&#x27;s new Creekside Gahanna redevelopment and park extension project began, making way for everything from public spaces and restaurants to residences and office space. As of late 2007, the project businesses began to open. The area includes a 389-space public parking garage. The multimillion-dollar project is expected to bring in up to 150 new residents as well as bolster tourism to the area.

Gahanna also has an aggressive brownfields assessment and redevelopment program that includes the development of a community-wide brownfields inventory, the cleanup of a major abandoned landfill, and city-initiated assessments and demolition of abandoned or environmentally suspect properties.

The largest brownfields redevelopment project to date is the closure of the Bedford I Landfill, completed in late 2007. The closure was a result of a 2005 public-private development partnership with private firm Value Recovery Group, of Columbus, Ohio, and non-profit Central Ohio Community Improvement Corporation to remediate and redevelop the abandoned Bedford I Landfill. The site was transformed into Central Park of Gahanna, a major greenfield development campus that features a golf academy known as The Golf Depot. The City of Gahanna and Value Recovery Group, which owns nearly 60 acres of the developable land, have been working to attract recreational, brewing industry, and office development and continue to solicit development opportunities. Funding for this major project included $3,000,000 from the Clean Ohio Redevelopment Fund, $200,000 from the US EPA, $150,000 from the Community Development Block Grant program, significant assistance with assessment, stormwater remediation, and staff time from Gahanna, and other investments by the Central Ohio CIC. 
Gahanna was listed as #96 of the Top 100 Best Places to Live in 2007 by &quot;Money&quot; magazine.

<text>Grove City is a city in Franklin County, Ohio, United States. Founded in 1852, it is a suburb of Columbus. The population was 41,252 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Until the mid-19th century, the area that is now Grove City was a wilderness filled with oak, beech, maple, walnut, dogwood and other trees. The area&#x27;s first European settler, Hugh Grant, operated a gristmill in Pittsburgh and transported excess goods down the Ohio River for sale, returning to Pittsburgh on foot. On one of these trips, he passed through the Scioto Valley region and in 1803, purchased the land that would become Grove City and returned with his wife Catharine to start a new life.

Grove City&#x27;s official founder, William F. Breck, bought 15.25 acres of the farm owned by Hugh Grant Jr., son of the first settler in Jackson Township, then added 300 more acres intended for farming. Breck&#x27;s original plan changed when he realized the potential for growth since Harrisburg Turnpike passed through the area to the state capital, Columbus. Breck envisioned a new village complete with a school, church, stores, blacksmith and carpenter shops. Breck formed a commission with George Weygandt, William Sibray and Jeremiah Smith and platted the village on the east side of Broadway in 1852.

By December 1853, the newly formed (but not yet incorporated) village of Grove City had 50 residents. The town founders named the village for the remaining groves of trees left standing after their initial clearing.

<text>Hilliard is a city in Franklin County, Ohio, United States. The population was 37,114 at the 2020 census. It is a suburb of Columbus and part of Norwich Township.

==History==

In 1852, John Reed Hilliard bought of farmland in western Franklin County, Ohio from Hoseah High and Abraham Wendell. Geographically, the Hilliard area is between Big Darby Creek on the west and the Scioto River on the east. Originally called Hilliard&#x27;s Station, the town grew around the railroad route of the Piqua and Indiana Railroad station, which bisected the former Hilliard farmland. Hilliard&#x27;s Station served as an ideal shipping point for agricultural products going to market and supplies coming to the farmers in the area. The original Hilliard area was platted by John Hilliard on September 1, 1853.

Until the mid 20th century, the railroad station and Main Street were the town center. In 1854, a post office was established in Hilliard&#x27;s Station and the word Station was dropped from the town name. The Village of Hilliard became incorporated on July 13, 1869 with a population of 280 residents. In 1886 the first railroad station was located on the north side of the tracks, west of Main Street, and remained there until 1962 when all railroad services ceased. The original train station has been restored and remains in Hilliard&#x27;s historical Weaver Park. The original platted area contained a mix of residences and businesses of varying ages and architecture.

The construction of three large residential subdivisions in the 1950s brought explosive growth to Hilliard. The connection to the Columbus regional sewer and water systems in the 1960s opened up the area to development. The Village of Hilliard gained city status officially from the Ohio Secretary of State by attaining a population of 5,633 on December 12, 1960.

With the completion of the I-270 outerbelt in the early 1970s, a second wave of explosive growth came to the area. Land uses in Hilliard continue to be a mix of residential and commercial development. A rich heritage of residential structures and architectural styles can be found in the historic district along Norwich Street.

==Geography==
Hilliard is bordered on the east by Columbus and Upper Arlington, on the north by Columbus and Dublin, on the south by Galloway and Columbus, and to the west lies open farmland. Downtown Columbus lies in a distance to the southeast, its skyline visible at times when crossing bridges.

<text>Marble Cliff is a village in Franklin County, Ohio, United States. The population was 634 at the 2020 census.

Marble Cliff was one of the first suburbs of Columbus, Ohio, settled as a community in 1890 and incorporated as the &quot;Hamlet of Marble Cliff&quot; in 1901. It took its name from the Marble Cliff Quarry Co. (still in use today), and at this time stretched all the way from the Scioto River to the Olentangy River. In 1902, it detached all land but its present area, and the area that separated became Grandview Heights in 1906. The village was named &quot;Arlington&quot; for a short time, which led its new neighbor to the north, incorporated in 1918, to name itself Upper Arlington. Marble Cliff is bordered by the cities of Upper Arlington, Grandview Heights, and Columbus.

Most of the village&#x27;s public services are provided by contract with Grandview Heights, including police and fire, and it is included in the Grandview Heights School District and public library system.

W. Bush and George W. Bush respectively. The Bush mansion itself was sold and converted to non-residential use (as a group home for the elderly). As of May 2007, it was renovated into upscale condominiums (Prescott Place).

<text>New Albany is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio, located northeast of the state capital of Columbus. Most of the city is located in Franklin County and a small portion extends into adjacent Licking County. New Albany had a population of 10,825 at the 2020 census. Founded in 1837, it is a growing suburb in the Columbus metropolitan area.

==History==

The land that was to become the city was founded in the center of Plain Township in 1837 by Nobel Landon and William Yantis. Land was split into lots measuring by and sold to new settlers. One theory about the name is that some of the original settlers migrated from the Albany, New York, area. Albany, Ohio was laid out in about 1832, which was prior to the founding of New Albany. During its history, the community has also been known by the name of Hope.

In 1856, New Albany was incorporated with a population of 50, and the first mayor (S. Ogden) was elected. The Wilkins Lumber Mill, later renamed the New Albany Mill, opened in 1881. In 1922, Mrs. Edward Babbitt was elected the first female mayor of New Albany.

In 1970, New Albany was much smaller, only consisting of a small part of Plain Township that did not touch Columbus. The first annual New Albany Founders Day Celebration was held in 1976. As late as 1980, the census only listed 414 residents in the village. Rapid growth in New Albany began in the 1990s, partly due to the expansion of the Les Wexner clothing empire and Wexner&#x27;s construction of his mansion (the second-largest in central Ohio behind the Longaberger mansion in the village). State Route 161 and access to 161 from I-270 was reconfigured around this time, allowing freeway access into and out of town.

In 2008, the New Albany Mill closed 119 years after its downtown opening. The original sawmill had been converted to a hardware store and was a staple in the lives of many of the residents of New Albany.

The 2009 Rifqa Bary controversy occurred in New Albany after teenager Fathima Rifqa Bary ran away to Florida under a claimed threat of an honor killing by her family due to her conversion to Christianity from Islam.

<text>New Rome is an unincorporated community in eastern Prairie Township, Franklin County, Ohio, United States, located on the west side of the Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area. It was originally incorporated as a village in 1947, and was dissolved in 2004. It encompassed an area roughly defined by Lawrence Ave., Norton Rd., Green St., and an unnamed alley paralleling Broad St. to the north. The population was 60 at the 2000 census.

New Rome achieved infamy due to its traffic court and speed trap, which received national media attention, and the internal corruption of its local government. In 2004, the village was ordered legally dissolved by a Franklin County Court of Common Pleas judge, and its residents, land and assets were made part of Prairie Township.

==History==
===New Rome speed trap===

New Rome police had systematically taken advantage of the village&#x27;s sudden drop from in the posted speed limit along the busy thoroughfare of West Broad Street (US 40) to pull over thousands of motorists, raising nearly $400,000 gross annually mainly from speeding tickets. These were supplemented by vehicle citations, including trivial offenses such as dusty taillights and improperly tinted windows. Nearly all of this money was funneled back into the police force, which almost exclusively dealt with traffic violations and so essentially existed to fund itself. The 60-resident village had as many as 15 policemen (all part-time), with the Village Council wanting more.

Many local business owners complained that customers were being driven away by the village&#x27;s reputation, and there were many reports of arbitrary and even abusive conduct at the hands of the New Rome police, who even ventured into surrounding jurisdictions to arrest people over unpaid traffic tickets. According to &quot;Reason&quot; magazine, &quot;Anger toward the tiny village and its police force led to a dedicated website for haters (newromesucks.com); an unflattering 2003 &quot;Car and Driver&quot; profile (&quot;a chickenshit town, a little police state&quot;); and frequent protests outside the double-wide trailer that functioned as the village hall, court, and police station.&quot;

The Ohio Department of Transportation eventually decided that New Rome&#x27;s lower speed limit was inconsistent with state law guidelines. The New Rome police force was suspended by the village in 2003 when its chief resigned, shortly after the village&#x27;s mayor&#x27;s court was abolished by the state, and so the speed trap came to an end.

===Theft and misuse of funds and equipment===
New Rome also had longstanding problems with internal corruption. Several past New Rome officials, including a past clerk, were caught stealing thousands of dollars in public funds; others, including a past mayor, resigned after misuse of village credit cards came to light. Approximately $120,000 was stolen from New Rome over the course of a decade, according to the Ohio State Auditor, who also concluded that the village&#x27;s poor accounting practices made continuing theft likely. Mayor&#x27;s court records were also reported to have been destroyed and falsified. A federal grant to the village in 1996 to fight purportedly rising burglaries, vandalism, and gang activity was instead used for traffic enforcement. In 2003, the New Rome police had their access to a State Highway Patrol driver identification database revoked because of misuse against the political rival of a council member.

===Election misconduct===
New Rome last held elections for the village council in 1979, and did not hold elections for mayor from 1995 to 2002. During that period, the incumbents simply reappointed themselves, taking the line that with so few residents, there were not enough people interested in running.

In 2002, after the state-certified election of a new reformist mayor, Jamie Mueller, the council refused to recognize him and claimed that the old mayor (to whom most of the Council were related) was still in office. The controversy soon broadened into a question of who was even legally on the Council, as none of the council appointments had been registered with the state as required by law. The Franklin County prosecutor eventually invalidated the appointments of all but one member, because they were not legally appointed, but village positions continued to be claimed by those without the legal right to do so.

===Dissolution===
After further investigation of New Rome&#x27;s history of misconduct, Attorney General Jim Petro, on the recommendation of State Auditor Betty Montgomery, concluded that it should be dissolved, though its residents had voted against dissolution in 2003. At the Attorney General&#x27;s urging, the Ohio General Assembly passed a law later that year primarily targeted at New Rome. It allowed the state to seek dissolution of a village that had fewer than 150 people if the State Auditor found it provided few or no public services and had a pattern of wrongdoing or incompetence. On December 1, 2003, Petro filed suit for New Rome&#x27;s dissolution in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. The complaint cited New Rome for violating state election requirements 23 times since 1988, failing to file a tax budget and failing to provide at least two municipal services.

The village officials did not contest these allegations, but instead challenged the dissolution statute as contrary to the home rule provisions of the Ohio Constitution. Judge David Cain upheld the constitutionality of the statute and granted summary judgment to the State of Ohio on July 30, 2004. In his decision, Cain held that as a result of town officials&#x27; malfeasance and nonfeasance, New Rome had effectively dissolved itself. &quot;When the electorate allows key offices to go vacant for unreasonable amounts of time and allows other conditions ... to cause ruin and decay,&quot; Cain wrote, &quot;it can easily be inferred that this small group of local citizens has abandoned any right it had to operate a local government unit. The corporate powers have already been surrendered. The body is already dead. The statute merely provides for a decent burial.&quot; Judge Cain granted the order to formally dissolve New Rome on August 9, 2004, and also ordered the clearing of all unpaid traffic tickets and all drivers licenses suspended by the village. No appeal was filed by the September 9 deadline, and on that date New Rome was irrevocably absorbed into Prairie Township.

The town&#x27;s dissolution became the subject of a 2018 short film, &quot;The Fall of New Rome&quot;.

<text>Upper Arlington (often known by its initials U.A.) is a city in Franklin County, Ohio, United States, on the northwest side of the Columbus metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the population was 36,800. The Old Arlington neighborhood is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 

==History==

The land on which present-day Upper Arlington sits was first known to be inhabited by the Adena people, renowned for building conical mounds for burial sites. Centuries later the Wyandot lived there, eventually being expelled after the U.S. Government gave land grants to Revolutionary War soldiers in lieu of pay. Property originally bestowed in this area to Elijah Backus, Jonathan Dayton and Andrew Marker was sold as farm property to a number of different families in the 1800s.

Brothers and real estate developers King and Ben Thompson founded Upper Arlington. They purchased the original 840 acres of land, south of present-day Lane Avenue, from James T. Miller in 1913. It was directly adjacent to the Marble Cliff Quarry Co. They first referred to the area as the &quot;Country Club District&quot; modeled after the Country Club development in Kansas City, but by 1917 the community had become known as &quot;Upper Arlington&quot; in reference to its southern neighbor of Arlington (now known as Marble Cliff). The Upper Arlington Company was incorporated that year and by 1920 operated out of a field office built in Miller Park; that building also served as a streetcar shelter house and is presently the Miller Park branch of the Upper Arlington Library. Upper Arlington operated as a village under the Ohio Revised Code. 

The development proceeded according to the Garden City–inspired plan by landscape architect William Pitkin, Jr., which called for following the contours of the land to form curving streets copiously lined with trees rather than a gridded street layout. This design style gave the oldest district in Upper Arlington (at its southernmost end) its distinctively pleasant, park-like feel, featuring numerous small green spaces.

In 1916, the development was interrupted when the National Guard used the area as a temporary training camp called Camp Willis after Ohio&#x27;s governor at the time, Frank B. Willis. Thousands of servicemen were trained at Camp Willis and then dispatched against Pancho Villa on the Mexican border. The camp was dismantled by September 1916. Development resumed shortly afterwards, and on March 20, 1918, Upper Arlington incorporated as a village with a population of 200. James T. Miller, the original landowner, served as the first mayor. The Mallway business district, which was constructed in the 1920s, was the first commercial district in Upper Arlington.

Many restrictions existed as Upper Arlington developed. Some of these involved creating open, green spaces, maintenance of parks, generous setbacks ensuring large front and corner lawns, and carefully controlled development of separate areas for businesses and multi-family housing. From 1920 to 1945, the city enforced racially restrictive covenants in property deeds. In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled that racially restrictive covenants were unenforceable, and in 1968, they became illegal.

Upper Arlington became a city on February 8, 1941 and annexed surrounding land as its population grew. Most annexation occurred in the late 1940s through 1960. The two largest annexations occurred in 1954 and 1955, by which the city nearly doubled its surface area. Henderson Road has been Upper Arlington&#x27;s northern border since 1969.

The annexed property was part of Perry Township, which had been home to numerous farm residents and their families in the 1800s. One such resident was Pleasant Litchford, a former slave who migrated north after buying his freedom, and who became a notable citizen in the African-American community. The current high school sits on property owned by Pleasant Litchford until his death in 1879. The property was annexed into Upper Arlington in the 1950s.

Other Perry Township farming family names from the 1800s include Kennedy, Kenny, Legg, and Trapp. The McCoy, Richards, Lakin, Matthews, Delashmutt, Phenegar, Slyh, Zollinger, Bickett, Wills and Walcutt families were connected in some way by marriage and have descendants living in Upper Arlington. Richards and McCoy family reunions were held for decades; their first was in 1895, with 109 in attendance.

The post–World War II housing boom led to the development of many new housing tracts north of Lane Avenue. The newer developments took on a much different character from the older core of the city, being mostly organized along normal street grids and with classic ranch-style houses like those found in the area called River Ridge. By the 1960s, as the city grew north, the houses were larger and the neighborhoods more consistent with the intent, if not style, of the original section south of Lane Avenue. The southern half of the city, designated as the &quot;Upper Arlington Historic District&quot; (or colloquially &quot;Old Arlington&quot; or &quot;South of Lane&quot;), was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

==Geography==
Upper Arlington is bordered on the west by the Scioto River, on the north and east by Columbus, and on the south by Marble Cliff and Grandview Heights. The Olentangy River and the main campus of the Ohio State University are a short distance to the east of Upper Arlington. Downtown Columbus lies to the southeast, its skyline visible across the OSU farmland research facilities extending along Upper Arlington&#x27;s eastern border.

The city is around 800 ft elevation located between the Olentangy and Scioto rivers. Two ravines cut through the city. The Slate Run in the northwest corner flows into the Scioto River. However, the Turkey Run is longer. It originates in the north then runs southwards until it makes an eastward bend around Reed Rd. Then, it flows eastwards through the OSU Golf Course. The run is used as a storm drain at points, has been dammed in the Ohio State course and runs through concrete pipes at two points. The soil is glacial till and is suitable for agriculture, supporting a research farm operated by Ohio State University.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Prior to 1967, the libraries in Upper Arlington were branches of the Grandview Heights Public Library. After circulation at the Upper Arlington branches surpassed their parent library, Mayor John Dunkel spearheaded an effort to challenge a law prohibiting new library systems in Ohio. The Ohio General Assembly passed Ohio House Bill No. 494 in 1967, allowing Upper Arlington to independently establish and govern its own library system.

<text>Worthington is a city in Franklin County, Ohio, United States, and is a northern suburb of Columbus. The population in the 2020 census was 14,786. The city was founded in 1803 by the Scioto Company led by James Kilbourne, who was later elected to the United States House of Representatives, and named in honor of Thomas Worthington, who later became governor of Ohio.

==History==
===First settlement===
On May 5, 1802, a group of prospective settlers founded the Scioto Company at the home of Rev. Eber B. Clark in Granby, Connecticut for the purpose of forming a settlement between the Muskingum River and Great Miami River in the Ohio Country. James Kilbourne was elected president and Josiah Topping secretary (McCormick 1998:7).

On August 30, 1802, James Kilbourne and Nathaniel Little arrived at Colonel Thomas Worthington&#x27;s home in Chillicothe, Ohio. They tentatively reserved land along the Scioto River on the Pickaway Plains for their new settlement (McCormick 1998:17).

On October 5, 1802, the Scioto Company met in Granby, Connecticut and decided not to purchase the lands along the Scioto River on the Pickaway Plains, but rather to buy land farther north from Dr. Jonas Stanbery and his partner, an American Revolutionary War general, Jonathan Dayton. Sixteen thousand acres (65 km) were purchased along the Whetstone River (now known as the Olentangy River) at $1.50 per acre (McCormick 1998:19-27). This land was part of the United States Military District surveyed by Israel Ludlow in 1797 and divided into townships square.

===Organization===
On May 7, 1803, James Kilbourne arrived at what is now Worthington to inspect the Scioto Company&#x27;s purchase. A work party of seven hired laborers, paid $12 per month each, soon began work clearing the forest (McCormick 1998: 29).

On August 10, 1803, the Scioto Company voted to name the village for Thomas Worthington, one of Ohio&#x27;s first two senators, and for each member to contribute $2 (about four days wages) to support a library.

In September 1803 the first settlers departed Connecticut by horse. Ezra Griswold was the lone settler who traveled by ox-cart. With this he is officially the first settler of Worthington, beating his fellow Company men to the site. By December 1803, Worthington was divided into 160, three quarter acre city lots with a public green in the center of the village. Thirty seven persons bid between $53 and $0.25 to select a lot. Those who bid nothing were given a choice of the remaining lots.

Farm lots, ranging from 20 to and averaging , were sold off in the same way. Both the Episcopal Church and Worthington Academy were given an farm lot and wood lot to provide financial support.

===Dissolution of the Company===
By August 11, 1804, the plat maps were completed, payments or notes promising payments collected and deeds prepared for all sixteen thousand acres (65 km) of the Scioto Company&#x27;s purchase (McCormick 1998:71). On January 28, 1805, having completed its work of apportioning land and establishing the church, school and library, the Scioto Company was dissolved (McCormick 1998:76).

===Incorporation===
On February 20, 1808, the Worthington Academy was incorporated by the Ohio legislature and a brick building was constructed facing the northeast quadrant of the public square. Its bell now adorns Kilbourne Middle School. That same year James Kilbourne erected a commercial building for a newspaper. This building still stands at 679-681 High Street as the oldest commercial building in continuous use in the state.

In 1811, Ezra Griswold built a large south-facing brick tavern on the lot north of the northeast quadrant of the public square. That same year, the Orange Johnson house was constructed north of the Village Green.

===War of 1812===
During the War of 1812, several Worthington militia marched north with General William Hull&#x27;s army and were surrendered at Detroit on August 12, 1812. Orders issued by General William Henry Harrison from &quot;Northwest Army Headquarters, Worthington, Ohio&quot; on October 28, 1812, indicate the commander, like his supply wagons, was using the road north from the capital. On September 7, 1814, Zophar Topping died while serving with Indian scouts. He was one of two Worthington casualties during the war along with Luther Palmer.
===Growth===
On May 24, 1813, James Kilbourne took a seat in the United States House of Representatives.

On August 25, 1817, President James Monroe visited Worthington. Also in 1817, Philander Chase moved to Worthington to become the first rector of St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church. He concurrently served as rector of Episcopal churches in Columbus and Delaware and as principal of the Worthington Academy. In June 1818, Rev. Chase was elected Bishop of the newly organized Episcopal Diocese of Ohio. Chase initially founded Kenyon College in Worthington.

The period from the 1820s to the Civil War was a time of slow growth for the sleepy village. In 1820, Aurora Buttles erected a Masonic hall. In 1826 the Columbus and Sandusky Turnpike was incorporated (now U.S. Route 23) to connect the center of the state to Lake Erie, further cementing the importance of High Street.

===Civil War===
In September, 1861 Captain William Pinney and 14 members of the &quot;Olentangy Reserves&quot; mustered into Company E of Thomas Worthington Jr.&#x27;s 46th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, which trained at Camp Lyon on the old Worthington Manufacturing Co. site southwest of the village. This unit suffered forty percent casualties at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862.

On April 29, 1865, at Appx 6:50 AM, President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s funeral train passed through Worthington en route to the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus.

===Post-war growth===
In 1866 the Bishop House was converted to the Union Hotel (Worthington Inn) by the Lewis family. In 1873 the Worthington School located at Evening Street and State Route 161 was completed. The first Worthington High School class graduated in 1880 (including 2 girls).

In 1931, the only Roman Catholic pontifical college outside of Italy, the Pontifical College Josephinum relocated just north of Worthington where it exists today.

==Geography==
Worthington is located at (40.091513, -83.020905).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The cities of Worthington and Riverlea form an enclave of Columbus.

Highways that pass through or adjacent to Worthington include Interstate 270, United States Route 23, Ohio State Route 161, and Ohio State Route 315.

Interstate 71 and Ohio State Route 710 pass just to the east of the city.

Except for a small border with Perry Township (Brookside Estates) on the west, Worthington is completely surrounded by Columbus.

Western Worthington now includes part of what used to be Linworth, and is home to the Linworth Alternative Program school.

<text>Broadcast News is a 1987 American romantic comedy-drama film written, produced and directed by James L. Brooks. The film concerns a virtuoso television news producer (Holly Hunter) who has daily emotional breakdowns, a brilliant yet prickly reporter (Albert Brooks), and the latter&#x27;s charismatic but far less seasoned rival (William Hurt). It also stars Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack, and Jack Nicholson.

The film was acclaimed by critics and at the 60th Academy Awards received seven nominations, including Best Picture. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;.

==Plot==
Jane Craig is a talented, intense news producer who is passionate about reporting and abhors the trend towards soft news in broadcasts. Her best friend and collaborator, Aaron Altman, is a gifted writer and reporter lacking in social skills. The two work in the Washington, D.C. bureau of a national TV network. The bureau hires Tom Grunick, a local news anchor who is handsome, likable, and telegenic but lacks news experience and isn&#x27;t especially bright.

Aaron and Jane go to Nicaragua to report on the Sandinista rebels and get caught up in a shooting battle between them and the contras, bringing home footage that wins the approval of their national anchor. At an office party, news arrives of a Libyan plane having bombed a U.S. military base in Italy. The network chief decides to air a special report, with Tom as anchor and Jane as executive producer. Aaron is devastated at Tom&#x27;s selection. Watching from his home, he calls Jane with pertinent information, which she feeds to Tom through his earpiece. With the combination of Tom&#x27;s on-camera poise and Jane&#x27;s hard-news skills, the report is a great success. Their teamwork also intensifies their mutual attraction.

Wanting to complete a story without outside assistance, Tom creates a piece on date rape that includes an interview with a rape victim, where Tom is shown tearing up in reaction. In the face of potential layoffs, Aaron receives an opportunity to anchor the weekend news due to most of his colleagues going to the White House Correspondents&#x27; Dinner. He seeks advice from Tom, who encourages Aaron to be more salesman-like in his approach. Aaron takes Tom&#x27;s advice but during the broadcast begins sweating uncontrollably, resulting in a disastrous broadcast. Meanwhile, Jane and Tom progress romantically at the White House Correspondents&#x27; Dinner. But before things get more involved, Jane leaves to console Aaron. The two have a heated argument, where Aaron tells Jane that Tom represents everything she hates about the direction of news media. He also tells Jane that he is in love with her.

The layoffs hit the network, resulting in many colleagues losing their jobs. Tom is moved to the London office, indicating that he is being groomed for a national anchor position; Jane is promoted to bureau chief. Tom and Jane agree to take a romantic getaway together before starting their new jobs. Aaron tells Jane he plans to take a job at a television station in Portland, Oregon. Before he leaves, he tells Jane that Tom&#x27;s tears during his date-rape piece were staged; reviewing the footage, Jane realizes that he is correct. She angrily confronts Tom at the airport, saying that his actions were a breach of journalistic ethics and that she cannot in good conscience become involved with him. Tom argues with her but relents, leaving Jane behind.

The three meet again seven years later. Tom has taken over as national anchor, Aaron has a wife and child, and Jane has a new boyfriend. Jane plans to take a managing editor role for the network in New York, working with Tom again. Tom leaves after Jane declines a dinner invitation with him and his fiancée, while she and Aaron catch up on their respective lives.

==Cast==
==Production==
The score was by Bill Conti. Emmy Award-winning composers Glen Roven and Marc Shaiman make cameo appearances as a dorky musician team who have composed a theme for the news program in the film.

The character of Jane Craig was based on journalist and news producer Susan Zirinsky. She served as associate producer and technical advisor for the film. The female lead was originally written for Debra Winger, who worked with James L. Brooks in &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;. However, Winger became pregnant and was replaced by Holly Hunter just two days before filming began. Sigourney Weaver, Dianne Wiest, Jessica Lange, Elizabeth Perkins, and Mary Beth Hurt were also considered for the role. Brooks originally wrote the role of Aaron Altman specifically for his longtime friend Albert Brooks in mind. Principal photography began in Washington, D.C. on February 2, 1987, officially wrapping in April 1987 after filming several scenes in Florida.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Broadcast News&quot; was given a limited release on December 16, 1987, in seven theaters and managed to gross USD $197,542 on its opening weekend. It went into wide release in the United States on December 25, 1987, in 677 theaters, grossing $5.5 million on its opening weekend. The film went on to make $51.3 million in North America and $16.1 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $67.3 million.

===Critical response===
Film critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave &quot;Broadcast News&quot; four out of four stars and praised the film for being as &quot;knowledgeable about the TV news-gathering process as any movie ever made, but it also has insights into the more personal matter of how people use high-pressure jobs as a way of avoiding time alone with themselves&quot;. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby wrote, &quot;As the fast-talking Aaron, Albert Brooks comes very close to stealing &quot;Broadcast News&quot;. Mr. Brooks ... is more or less the conscience of &quot;Broadcast News&quot;&quot;. Jonathan Rosenbaum, in his review for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, praised Holly Hunter&#x27;s performance as &quot;something of a revelation: her short, feisty, socially gauche, aggressive-compulsive character may be the most intricately layered portrait of a career woman that contemporary Hollywood has given us&quot;.

Hal Hinson, in his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, wrote, &quot;[James] Brooks is excellent at taking us inside the world of television, but not terribly good at analyzing it. He has a facile, too-pat approach to dealing with issues; there&#x27;s still too much of the sitcom mentality at work&quot;. In his review for &quot;Time&quot;, Richard Corliss praised William Hurt&#x27;s performance: &quot;Hurt is neat too, never standing safely outside his character, always allowing Tom to find the humor in his too-rapid success, locating a dimness behind his eyes when Tom is asked a tough question -- and for Tom, poor soulless sensation-to-be, all questions are tough ones&quot;. The magazine also ranked &quot;Broadcast News&quot; as one of the best films of the year. The film garnered a 98% rating at Rotten Tomatoes from 52 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Blockbuster dramatist James L. Brooks delivers with &quot;Broadcast News&quot;, fully entertaining with deft, deep characterization.&quot; The film has an 84% average score at Metacritic, based on 16 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

<text>Wauseon ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Fulton County, Ohio, approximately 31 mi (51 km) west of Toledo. The population was 7,568 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Wauseon was platted 1853 when the Michigan Southern Air Railway was extended to that point. Land speculators bought 160 acres of land, which would become the City of Wauseon. The original name for the city was &quot;Litchfield&quot; after Litchfield, New York, where many of the city&#x27;s new settlers had emigrated from. However, Hortensia Hayes, the daughter of an early settler, suggested that the new village be named after an Ottawa Tribe Chief named Wauseon, who was forced by the federal government to forfeit their land, before moving to Oklahoma in 1839. The village was incorporated in 1859. With the commercial success that the railroad brought, Wauseon would grow larger than the original seat of Fulton County (Ottokee), and in 1869 Wauseon was named the county seat. The Fulton County Courthouse was built in 1871.

Between 1901 and 1939, the community was served by the Toledo and Indiana Railway, an interurban between Toledo and Bryan, Ohio. The construction of the Ohio Turnpike in the mid 20th century also helped lead to the commercial growth of Wauseon.

<text>Cheshire is a village in Gallia County, Ohio, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 123 at the 2020 census. It is part of the rural Point Pleasant micropolitan area.

==History==
Cheshire, Ohio, was named for the county of Cheshire in England.

===Town buyout by American Electric Power===
By 2000, the village was plagued by toxic sulfurous gas clouds and acid rain from the nearby coal-fired Gavin Power Plant. Residents hired lawyers requesting a buyout. The plant&#x27;s owner, American Electric Power (AEP), investigated the claims and found that no long-term injuries/illnesses resulted from the cloud but decided it could use the land to expand plant property for future technologies. In 2002, AEP reached a settlement with residents that was effectively a $20 million buyout. Most of the 221 residents agreed to leave the town and absolve the company from future property or health claims, while some remain through either deals with the company or refusal to sell their property. The company announced plans to demolish the existing structures and construct a dock facility for coal barges, but has not yet begun work on constructing them.

In 2004, the remaining villagers of Cheshire and residents of the surrounding area took steps to expand the village limits by annexing properties within about a mile north and west of the previous village limits.

<doc id="129288" wikidata="Q176684" url="?curid=129288" title="Gallipolis, Ohio">
<text>Gallipolis ( ) is a chartered village in and the county seat of Gallia County, Ohio, United States. The municipality is located in Southeast Ohio along the Ohio River about southeast of Chillicothe and northwest of Charleston, West Virginia. The population was 3,313 at the 2020 census. Gallipolis is the second-largest community in the rural Point Pleasant micropolitan area, which includes all of Gallia County, Ohio, and Mason County, West Virginia.

==History==
Gallipolis was first settled by Europeans in 1790: &quot;The French 500&quot; were a group of French aristocrats, merchants, and artisans who were fleeing the violence and disruption of the French Revolution. They were led by Count Jean-Joseph de Barth, an Alsatian member of the French National Assembly. It was the second city to be founded in the newly organized Northwest Territory of the United States. It is known as &quot;The Old French City&quot; because of this beginning.

This was a time of rampant land speculation in the Northwest Territory, recently opened for settlement after it was organized following the Northwest Indian Wars. The French had worked with the Scioto Company, a purported land development company registered in Paris in 1789, paying its agents for land along the Ohio River. They sailed to the United States on several ships, most to Alexandria, Virginia, outside Washington, DC. From there they traveled over land and by the Ohio River to reach Gallipolis. The French were city people and were taken aback by the undeveloped frontier they encountered.

When they arrived at the Gallipolis area, they learned their deeds of land were worthless. The Scioto Company did not own the land, for which the Ohio Company had an option for development. They survived somehow, building cabins close together in what is now City Park, with a defensive palisade and bastions. In 1795, President George Washington&#x27;s administration granted the settlers free land in the French Grant in southwest present-day Scioto County, Ohio. Under the terms of this grant, settlers had to live on the land for 5 years and show cultivation to become owners. Settlers who chose to stay in Gallipolis had to pay again for their plots, this time to the Ohio Company. Most either sold their land in the French Grant or arranged to have tenants farm it.

The name Gallipolis is a construct of the Greek or Latin prefix &quot;Galli-&quot; and the Greek suffix &quot;-polis&quot;, meaning &quot;city of the French&quot;. A US post office called Gallipolis began operating there in 1794.

On November 30, 1893, the state-run Asylum for Epileptics and Epileptic Insane opened. Later it would become the Gallipolis Developmental Center, which is still operational today serving 52 patients with developmental disabilities in the Appalachian Ohio region.

On December 15, 1967, the Silver Bridge, connecting Gallipolis to Point Pleasant, West Virginia, across the Ohio River, collapsed under the weight of rush-hour traffic, resulting in the deaths of 46 people. It had been built in 1928, and analysis showed that the bridge was carrying much heavier loads than it had originally been designed for and had been poorly maintained. It was replaced by the Silver Memorial Bridge, completed in 1969. When the population dropped below 5,000, Gallipolis lost its city status and was classified as a village under state law. It continues to operate its government under its existing city charter.

Sports facilities include Memorial Field and Cliffside Golf Club. The waterworks facility on Chestnut Street also has green space and some ballfields. The park is known for &quot;Gallipolis in Lights,&quot; a Christmas light display that has received national recognition.

Haskins Memorial Park is contiguous with the golf club. The Elizabeth L. Evans Waterfowl and Bird Sanctuary are adjacent to Memorial Field, which also features a skate park. The Texas Road Wildlife Area is located close by.

The village owns and operates the Pine Street and Mound Hill cemeteries. Mound Hill Park has picnic tables and is adjacent to the cemetery; both have a long view over the Ohio River, the village of Gallipolis, and the opposite shore. At least two persons of the founding French 500 are said to have been buried in Mound Hill cemetery. It was officially established in 1880 but had been used for burials before that.

==Transportation==
U.S. Route 35 traverses the community, and provides a link to West Virginia across the Ohio River. State routes include Ohio State Route 7, State Route 141, State Route 160, and State Route 588. Gallipolis is served by the Gallia-Meigs Regional Airport.

==Education==
There are four schools within the village. The public schools in the city limits are Gallia Academy Middle School and Washington Elementary, both of which belong to the Gallipolis City Schools. The public school district also controls Gallia Academy High School, Green Elementary and Rio Grande Elementary, which are located outside the village limits.

The noted scientist Edward Alexander Bouchet, the first African American to earn a doctorate from an American university, served as principal of the village&#x27;s Lincoln High School from 1908 to 1913. Educator and amateur mycologist Miron Elisha Hard served as principal from 1873 to 1875.

On November 8, 2005, a bond issue was passed, allowing for both the construction of a new high school and the renovation of the three public elementary schools. The new Gallia Academy High School, which was completed in the summer of 2009, is located at 2855 Centenary Road, a few miles outside the village limits.

In addition there is a private school: Ohio Valley Christian School, which includes both elementary and secondary grades.

The village is served by the Dr. Samuel L. Bossard Memorial Library, the county&#x27;s only public lending library.

==Name and history==

Named for Commodore William Bainbridge, it is the only Bainbridge Township statewide. The village of Bainbridge, Ohio, is located in Ross County, in Southern Ohio.

The first residents of Bainbridge were the McConougheys, who came from Blandford, Massachusetts. Many other settlers followed. In 1817, Bainbridge Township was established. The first housing subdivision, Lake Lucerne, opened in 1922. It is still one of the largest in Bainbridge.

The Geauga County Public Library opened a branch in Bainbridge in 1965. Initially located in a small storefront, the Bainbridge Library was expanded considerably upon moving to a new building.

==Government==
The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.

==Community fundraising==

Community members have raised funds to support a variety of community activities over the years. Among them are two annual events managed by The Bainbridge Men&#x27;s Civic Club: The Taste of Bainbridge and the Ox Roast. The Taste of Bainbridge began in 1997; the first Ox Roast took place in 2012. For the Taste of Bainbridge, participating local restaurants prepare and serve menu items that are served to diners who donate an entry fee. The Ox Roast features more activities and fewer food vendors. All proceeds from both events go to community programs such as scholarships for students and the nonprofit Bainbridge Area Food for Friends. The Ox Roast is held at Centerville Mills Park, a former YMCA camp now owned by the township.

<doc id="129294" wikidata="Q384464" url="?curid=129294" title="Hattiesburg, Mississippi">
<text>Hattiesburg is the 4th most populous city in the U.S. state of Mississippi, located primarily in Forrest County (where it is the county seat and most populous city) and extending west into Lamar County. The city population was 45,989 at the 2010 census, with the population now being 48,730 in 2020. Hattiesburg is the principal city of the Hattiesburg Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses Covington, Forrest, Lamar, and Perry counties. The city is the anchor of the Pine Belt region.

Development of the interior of Mississippi took place primarily after the American Civil War. Before that time, only properties along the major rivers were developed as plantations. Founded in 1882 by civil engineer William H. Hardy, Hattiesburg was named in honor of Hardy&#x27;s wife Hattie. The town was incorporated two years later with a population of 400. Hattiesburg&#x27;s population first expanded as a center of the lumber and railroad industries, from which was derived the nickname &quot;The Hub City&quot;.

Hattiesburg is a prominent college town, home to the University of Southern Mississippi (founded as Mississippi Normal College, for the training of teachers) and William Carey University (formerly William Carey College). South of Hattiesburg is Camp Shelby, the largest US National Guard training base east of the Mississippi River, which hosts up to 100,000 National Guardsmen and Reservists annually.

==History==

During European colonization, this area was first claimed by the French. Between 1763 and 1783 the area that is currently Hattiesburg fell under the jurisdiction of the colony of British West Florida. After the United States gained its independence, Great Britain ceded this and other areas to it after 1783. The United States gained a cession of lands from the Choctaw and Chickasaw under the terms of the Treaty of Mount Dexter in 1805. After the treaty was ratified, European-American settlers began to move into the area.

In the 1830s, the Choctaw and Chickasaw were relocated by United States authorities by treaties authorized by the Indian Removal Act, which sought to relocate the Five Civilized Tribes from the Southeast to west of the Mississippi River. They and their slaves were moved to Indian Territory in today&#x27;s Kansas and Oklahoma.

Hattiesburg developed at the confluence of the Leaf and Bouie rivers. It was founded in 1882 by Captain William H. Hardy, a civil engineer. The city of Hattiesburg was incorporated in 1884 with a population of approximately 400. Originally called Twin Forks and later Gordonville, the city received its final name of Hattiesburg from Capt. Hardy, in honor of his wife Hattie. Hattiesburg is centrally located less than 100 miles from the state capital of Jackson, as well as from the Mississippi Gulf Coast, New Orleans, Louisiana, and Mobile, Alabama.

In 1884, a railroad—known then as the New Orleans and Northeastern—was built from Meridian, Mississippi, in the center of the state, through Hattiesburg to New Orleans. The completion of the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad (G&amp;SIRR) from Gulfport, to the capital of Jackson, Mississippi, also ran through Hattiesburg. It stimulated a lumber boom in 1897, with interior pine forests being harvested at a rapid pace. Although the railroad took 20 years to be developed, the G&amp;SIRR more than fulfilled its promise. It gave the state access to a deep water harbor at Gulfport, more than doubled the population of towns along its route, stimulated the growth of the City of Gulfport, and made Hattiesburg a railroad center. In 1924, the G&amp;SIRR operated as a subsidiary of the Illinois Central Railroad but lost its independent identity in 1946.

Hattiesburg gained its nickname, the Hub City, in 1912 as a result of a contest in a local newspaper. It was named because it was at the intersection of a number of important rail lines. Later U.S. Highway 49, U.S. Highway 98 and U.S. Highway 11, and later, Interstate 59 also intersected in and near Hattiesburg.

The region around Hattiesburg was involved in testing during the development of weapons in the nuclear arms race of the Cold War. In the 1960s, two nuclear devices were detonated in the salt domes near Lumberton, Mississippi, about 28 miles southwest of Hattiesburg. Extensive follow-up of the area by the EPA has not revealed levels of nuclear contamination in the area that would be harmful to humans.

Throughout the 20th century, Hattiesburg benefited from the founding of Camp Shelby (now a military mobilization center), two major hospitals, and two colleges, The University of Southern Mississippi and William Carey University. The growing metropolitan area that includes Hattiesburg, Forrest and Lamar counties, was designated a Metropolitan Statistical Area in 1994 with a combined population of more than 100,000 residents.

Although about inland, Hattiesburg was hit very hard in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina. Around 10,000 structures in the area received major damage of some type from the heavy winds and rain, as the hurricane tracked inland. Approximately 80 percent of the city&#x27;s roads were blocked by trees, and power was out in the area for up to 14 days. The storm killed 24 people in Hattiesburg and the surrounding areas. The city has struggled to cope with a large influx of temporary evacuees and new permanent residents from coastal Louisiana and Mississippi towns to the south, where damage from Katrina was catastrophic.

The City is known for its police department, as it was the first—and for almost a decade the only—Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies federally accredited law enforcement agency in the State of Mississippi. The department is served by its own training academy. It is considered one of the most difficult basic academies in the country, with a more than 50% attrition rate.

The Hattiesburg Zoo at Kamper Park is a longstanding tourist attraction in the city.

In 2011, the Hattiesburg Historic Neighborhood District was named one of the &quot;Great Places In America,&quot; to live by the American Planning Association. Places are selected annually and represent the gold standard in terms of having a true sense of place, cultural and historical interest. The twenty-five-block neighborhood has one of the best collections of Victorian-era houses in Mississippi, with more than ninety percent of the houses substantially renovated and maintained. The Hattiesburg Historic Neighborhood District [HHND] was Hattiesburg&#x27;s first recognized historic district and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is also part of an Historic Conservation District and protected by Historic Hattiesburg Design Guidelines.

In 2013, the Hattiesburg Historic Neighborhood District celebrated the 38th Annual Victorian Candlelit Christmas and Holiday Tour of Homes. During the two nights of the Victorian Candlelit Christmas, thousands of candles burn in white bags lining the sidewalks. Christmas carolers from the three churches: Sacred Heart, Court Street Methodist, and Bay Street Presbyterian, stroll house to house singing Christmas music. Horse-drawn carriages carry visitors through the neighborhood at a walking pace.
The Miss Hospitality Pageant began in 1949. Hattiesburg was chosen in 1997 to sponsor the state pageant. The purpose of the pageant is the selection and presentation of a young, knowledgeable lady to help promote the state in tourism and economic development. Contestants are judged on the following categories: panel interview, one-on-one interview competition, Mississippi speech competition, commercial/black dress competition, and evening gown competition. The 2011 winner was Ann Claire Reynolds, a junior at University of Southern Mississippi who was majoring in elementary and special education.

Hattiesburg is home to the African American Military History Museum. The building opened as a USO club in 1942 to serve African Americans serving at Camp Shelby, as local facilities were racially segregated. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This building is the only remaining USO club site in the United States. It has been adapted for use as a museum interpreting African-American military history. Exhibits show their participation in all the major wars and the founding of Hattiesburg: exhibits include the Revolutionary War, Buffalo Soldiers, World Wars I and II, Desegregation, Korean War, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Global War on Terrorism, You Can Be A Soldier, Hattiesburg&#x27;s Hall of Honor, and World Map. The museum is dedicated to the many African-American soldiers who have fought for their country.

===Civil rights movement===
Hattiesburg and the unincorporated African-American community of Palmers Crossing played a key role in the civil rights transitions of the 1960s. In 1959, black Korean War veteran Clyde Kennard applied to attend then all-white Mississippi Southern College (today University of Southern Mississippi). He was denied admission because of his race, as state colleges were legally segregated. When he persisted, the newly formed Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, a taxpayer-supported agency ostensibly set up to encourage tourism, conspired to have him framed for a crime. He was sentenced to seven years in Parchman Prison. For years, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People leaders Medgar Evers, Vernon Dahmer, and other Forrest County civil rights activists fought to overturn the conviction. The MSSC conducted outrageous activities against citizens of the state: MSSC agents investigated citizens while the organization created blacklists of activists and black professionals who were suspected of working for civil rights, conducted economic boycotts against black-owned businesses, and arranged for blacks to be fired from state and local jobs. They also worked to have Black activists or suspected activists evicted from rental housing. All of this was conducted in secret, until later allegations of revelations brought the state&#x27;s activities into the open.
Forrest County Registrar Theron Lynd prevented blacks in the area from registering to vote, based on such devices in the state constitution as poll taxes, and literacy and comprehension tests, subjectively administered by whites. In 1960, thirty percent of the population in the county was black, but less than 1% of blacks had been able to register, regardless of their education level. Registration by whites was close to 100%. In 1961, the U.S. Justice Department filed suit against Lynd. He was the first southern registrar to be convicted under the Civil Rights Act of 1957 for systematically violating African-American voting rights.

In 1962, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) began one of its first voter-registration projects in Hattiesburg under the auspices of the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO). By 1964, the Delta Ministry was active in the city. In cooperation with the NAACP and local civil rights leaders, they formed the Forrest County Voters League. In conjunction with the 1963 elections, civil rights leaders organized a statewide Freedom Ballot, a mock election that highlighted both the statewide pattern of voting rights discrimination and the strong desire of Mississippi blacks for the franchise. Despite the serious risk of both physical and economic retaliation, nearly half of Forrest County blacks participated, the highest turnout in the state.

January 22, 1964, was &quot;Freedom Day&quot; in Hattiesburg, a major voter registration effort supported by student demonstrators and 50 northern clergymen. For the first time since Reconstruction, an inter-racial protest successfully picketed the courthouse for voting rights without being arrested. Roughly 100 African Americans attempted to register, though only a few were allowed into the courthouse. Fewer still succeeded in gaining entry on the rolls. Each day thereafter for many months, activists resumed the courthouse protest in what became known as the &quot;Perpetual Picket.&quot;

During Freedom Summer in 1964, the Hattiesburg/Palmers Crossing project was the headquarters for all civil rights activity in Mississippi&#x27;s 5th congressional district. This was the largest and most active site in the state, with more than 90 volunteers and 3,000 local participants. Hundreds of Forrest County blacks tried to register to vote at the courthouse, but blacks once again were prevented from doing so. More than 650 children and adults attended one of the seven Freedom Schools in Hattiesburg and Palmers Crossing, three freedom libraries were set up with donated books, and a community center was established. Many whites opposed civil rights efforts by blacks, and both summer volunteers and local African Americans endured arrests, beatings, firings, and evictions.

Forrest County was also a center of activity for the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP). It sent a slate of delegates to the National Democratic Convention in Atlantic City that year to challenge the seating of the all-white, pro-segregation delegates elected by the regular party in primaries from which African Americans had been largely excluded due to voter registration barriers. Victoria Jackson Gray of Palmers Crossing ran on the MFDP ticket against incumbent Senator John Stennis, and John Cameron of Hattiesburg ran for Representative in the 5th District. With few blacks having successfully been able to register to vote, these candidates did not have a realistic chance of victory. Nonetheless, their campaigns helped to encourage the further enfranchisement and political agency of black citizens.

Even after passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, white resistance continued in Mississippi and Hattiesburg. On the night of January 10, 1966, the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan attacked the Hattiesburg home of NAACP leader Vernon Dahmer with firebombs and gunfire. Dahmer was the most prominent black leader in the county and had been the primary civil rights leader for many years. Just prior to the attack, he had announced that he would help pay a $2 poll tax () for black voters too poor to do so themselves. Dahmer held off the Klan with his rifle to give his wife, their three young children, and elderly aunt time to escape their burning home, but he died of burns and smoke inhalation the next day. His murder sparked large protest marches in Hattiesburg. A number of Klansmen were arrested for the crime, and four were eventually convicted. After four previous trials had ended in deadlocks, KKK Imperial Wizard Samuel Bowers was finally convicted in August 1998 for ordering the assassination of Dahmer. He was sentenced to life in prison.

In 1970, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against trespass convictions of civil rights protesters in &quot;Adickes v. S.H. Kress Co.&quot;. The case involved a sit-in at the lunch counter of the S. H. Kress &amp; Co. downtown.

===Vela Uniform/Project Dribble nuclear tests===
Vela Uniform was an element of Project Vela, conducted jointly in the 1960s by the United States Department of Energy and the Advanced Research Projects Agency. Its purpose was to develop seismic methods for detecting underground nuclear testing. The Project Dribble program involved two underground nuclear detonations. Test SALMON occurred on October 22, 1964, with a 5.3 kiloton yield; test STERLING was detonated December 3, 1966, with a yield of 380 tons. Both detonations took place within Tatum Salt Dome, southwest of the Hattiesburg/Purvis area.

==Geography==
Most of Hattiesburg is in Forrest County. A smaller portion on the west side is in Lamar County, with abundant commercial land gained in a 2008 annexation. This consists of a narrow stretch of land east of I-59 and an irregularly shaped extension into West Hattiesburg. In the 2000 census, 42,475 of the city&#x27;s 44,779 residents (94.9%) lived in Forrest County and 2,304 (5.1%) in Lamar County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and , or 1.63%, is water.

Hattiesburg is north of Biloxi and southeast of Jackson, the state capital.

=== Geology and paleontology ===
Hattiesburg is on an outcrop of the Pascagoula and Hattiesburg formation that is thought to be Miocene in age. Miocene plant and animal fossils discovered in Hattiesburg&#x27;s vicinity indicate the area was once more swamp-like and dominated by low-growing palm trees.

=== Climate ===
Hattiesburg has a humid subtropical climate, with short, mild winters and hot, humid summers. Snowfall is extremely rare, but on December 11, 2008, areas around Hattiesburg received . As is the case throughout the southern United States, severe thunderstorms can pose a threat, particularly during spring. Such storms spawn frequent lightning, heavy rain, occasional large hail, and tornadoes.
An EF4 tornado struck the Hattiesburg area on February 10, 2013, between roughly 5:00 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. CST. It formed in Lamar County just west of Oak Grove and quickly increased in size and intensity. Although the most severe damage occurred in the Oak Grove area, especially near Oak Grove High School, the tornado continued eastward into Hattiesburg, causing widespread EF1-EF3 damage to the southern portion of the University of Southern Mississippi campus and the areas just north of downtown. It then moved into neighboring Petal and rural Forrest County. More than 80 injured were reported but no fatalities. The prevention of deaths was attributed to the nearly 30-minute lead time of the tornado warning.
The most recent tornado struck on January 21, 2017, when an EF3 hit the city early in the morning, killing four and injuring 20. Some 10,000 people were left without power.
==Demographics==

In 2000, there were 44,779 people, 17,295 households, and 9,391 families residing within the city limits. By the publication of the 2020 United States census, there were 48,730 people, 17,778 households, and 9,165 families residing in the city, reflecting the continued positive increase in municipal population since the 1900 census.

===Religion===
In 2010 the Hattiesburg Metropolitan area has an Evangelical Protestant majority with 66,000 members. The Southern Baptist Convention had 85 congregations and 53,000 members. The United Methodist Church had 35 congregations and 9,000 members. The third largest was the Presbyterian Church in America with 5 congregations and 1,518 members.

==Economy==

Hattiesburg is home to several national business branches that hold thousands of jobs across the Pine Belt. It was headquarters to the now defunct International Filing Company and currently hosts branches of Kohler Engines and BAE Systems Inc., as well as Berry Plastics and the Coca-Cola Bottling Company United, Pepsi Cola Bottling Co., and Budweiser Distribution Co. Companies such as Sunbeam (shared with Mr. Coffee, and the Coleman Company) and Kimberly Clark used to manufacture in Hattiesburg.

Regions Financial Corporation operates a large operations center in the city, which employs nearly 500 people. Jones Capital recently celebrated the groundbreaking of their new $50 million corporate headquarters facility in Midtown Hattiesburg across from The University of Southern Mississippi. Jones operates globally with over 1,000 employees in total, 500 of those are employed in the State of MS. The new headquarters facility will serve as the primary office for over 300 MS-based employees.

The main shopping mall is Turtle Creek Mall.

<text>Fatal Attraction is a 1987 American psychological thriller film directed by Adrian Lyne and written by James Dearden, based on his 1980 short film &quot;Diversion&quot;. It follows Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas), an attorney who cheats on his wife Beth (Anne Archer) with a colleague, Alex Forrest (Glenn Close). When Dan decides to end the affair, Alex grows increasingly unstable and begins stalking him and his family.

&quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; was released in the United States on September 18, 1987. It grossed $320 million on a $14 million production budget, becoming the second highest-grossing film of the year in the United States. It received acclaim, with particular praise for its direction, editing, screenplay, and performances. It received six nominations at the 60th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Lyne, Best Actress for Close, and Best Supporting Actress for Archer. Considered a pop culture phenomenon in the years since its release, the film is also credited for triggering the erotic thriller boom of the late 1980s to the mid 1990s.

A play based on the film opened in London&#x27;s West End at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2014. In 2023, a television adaptation was broadcast on Paramount+.

== Plot ==
Dan Gallagher is an attorney from Manhattan. While his wife, Beth, and daughter, Ellen, are out of town visiting Beth&#x27;s family, he has an affair with Alex Forrest, an editor for a publishing company. Alex begins to cling to him. Dan reluctantly spends the following day with Alex. When he tries to leave, she cuts her wrists. Dan helps her and leaves in the morning.

Alex comes to Dan&#x27;s office to apologize. He declines her invitation to a performance of &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;. She continues to call him at his office until he informs his secretary that he will no longer take her calls. Alex insists that Dan meet her and tells him she is pregnant, arguing that he must take responsibility. After Dan changes their phone number, Alex meets Beth, who has advertised selling their apartment, pretending to be interested in buying it. That night, Dan goes to Alex&#x27;s apartment to confront her and they get into a scuffle.

Dan, Beth and Ellen move to Bedford. She has a tape recording of herself delivered to him, which is full of verbal abuse. She stalks him, pours acid onto his car and follows him home later that evening. The sight of his happy family through their window makes her vomit. Dan approaches the police to file a restraining order, claiming it is for a client. The lieutenant informs him that he cannot violate Alex&#x27;s rights without probable cause, and that the client must own up to his adultery.

When Dan, Beth and Ellen return home, they discover Alex has boiled Ellen&#x27;s pet rabbit on their stove. Dan confesses the affair and Alex&#x27;s pregnancy to Beth. Enraged, Beth orders him to leave. Dan calls Alex to say Beth knows about the affair. Beth takes the phone and tells Alex that she will kill her if Alex comes near their family again. Alex picks Ellen up from her school and kidnaps her, taking her to an amusement park. Beth drives around frantically looking for her and gets into an accident, requiring hospitalization. Alex returns Ellen home unharmed.

After visiting Beth in the hospital, Dan forcibly enters Alex&#x27;s apartment and attempts to strangle her, but stops short of killing her. She grabs a kitchen knife and lunges at him, but he disarms her and leaves. The police search for Alex after Dan reports the kidnapping. Beth forgives Dan, and they return home after Beth is discharged from the hospital. While Beth prepares to take a bath, Alex attacks her with a knife. Dan rushes upstairs, subdues Alex and appears to drown her in the bathtub, but she emerges swinging the knife. Beth shoots her dead. Dan completes his statement to the police and joins Beth in the living room.

== Production ==

=== Writing ===
The film was adapted by James Dearden (with assistance from Nicholas Meyer) from Dearden&#x27;s 1980 short film &quot;Diversion&quot;. In Meyer&#x27;s book &quot;The View from the Bridge: Memories of Star Trek and a Life in Hollywood&quot;, he explains that in late 1986 producer Stanley R. Jaffe asked him to look at the script developed by Dearden, and he wrote a four-page memo making suggestions, including a new ending. John Carpenter was approached to direct the film, but turned it down as he felt it was too similar to &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot; (1971). A few weeks later Meyer met with the director Adrian Lyne and gave him some additional suggestions. Meyer was asked to redraft the script to create the shooting script.

=== Casting ===
Producers Sherry Lansing and Stanley R. Jaffe both had serious doubts about casting Glenn Close because they did not think she could be sexual enough. Instead, they had many other actresses in mind. Barbara Hershey was originally considered; she wanted the role but she was unavailable. Several actresses auditioned for the part, but they were almost all turned down. Lyne had French actress Isabelle Adjani in mind for the role. Tracey Ullman was approached for the role, but she declined due to a scene in the script where the character boils a bunny. Miranda Richardson also turned it down as she found it &quot;hideous.&quot; Ellen Barkin, Debra Winger, Susan Sarandon, Jessica Lange, Judy Davis, Melanie Griffith and Michelle Pfeiffer were also considered for the role. Kirstie Alley auditioned for the role. Close was persistent, and after meeting with Jaffe several times in New York, she was asked to fly out to Los Angeles to read with Michael Douglas in front of Adrian Lyne and Lansing. Before the audition, she let her naturally frizzy hair &quot;go wild&quot; because she was impatient at putting it up, and she wore a slimming black dress she thought made her look &quot;fabulous&quot; to the audition. This impressed Lansing, because Close &quot;came in looking completely different... right away she was into the part.&quot; Close and Douglas performed a scene from early in the script, where Alex flirts with Dan in a café, and Close came away &quot;convinced my career was over, that I was finished, I had completely blown my chances&quot;. Lansing and Lyne were both convinced she was right for the role; Lyne stated that &quot;an extraordinary erotic transformation took place. She was this tragic, bewildering mix of sexuality and rage—I watched Alex come to life.&quot;

To prepare for her role, Close consulted several psychologists, hoping to understand Alex&#x27;s psyche and motivations. She was uncomfortable with the bunny boiling scene, which she thought was too extreme, but she was assured on consulting the psychologists that such an action was entirely possible and that Alex&#x27;s behavior corresponded to someone who had experienced incestual sexual abuse as a child. While filming her death scene, Close suffered a concussion and was hospitalized. She later found out that she was pregnant during filming.

=== Alternate ending ===
Alex was originally scripted slashing her throat at the film&#x27;s end with the knife Dan had left on the counter, so as to make it appear that Dan had murdered her. After seeing her husband being taken away by police, Beth finds a revealing cassette tape that Alex sent Dan in which she threatens to kill herself. Beth takes the tape to the police, who clear Dan of the murder. The last scene shows, in flashback, Alex taking her own life by slashing her throat while listening to &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;.

When the film was test-screened for audiences, the ending was poorly received as audiences disliked the idea of Alex triumphing in the end. After doing test screenings, Joseph Farrell (who handled the test screenings) suggested that Paramount shoot a new ending. While Douglas approved of changing the ending as he believed it was &quot;best for the film&quot;, most of the cast and crew disliked the idea. Archer was &quot;appalled&quot; by the change and burst into tears when she heard the news. Close had doubts, believing Alex would &quot;self-destruct and commit suicide&quot;. Lyne initially refused to change the ending until Lansing offered him an additional $1.5 million salary, while Dearden reluctantly agreed to write the new ending believing the film would be a bigger hit if changed.

Close fought against the change for two weeks before eventually giving in on her concerns and filming the new sequence after William Hurt convinced her to do it. Though the ending was not the one she preferred, she acknowledged that the film would not have been as successful without it, because it gave the audience &quot;a sense of catharsis, a hope, that somehow the family unit would survive the nightmare&quot;.

While Lyne has stood by the theatrical ending believing it was a &quot;good idea&quot;, Dearden and Close have continued to express their dismay. In 2010, during a cast reunion interview, Close shared that she &quot;never thought of [her character] as a villain&quot; and said: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t playing a generality. I wasn&#x27;t playing a cliché. I was playing a very specific, deeply disturbed, fragile human being, whom I had grown to love.&quot; Close also stated that she doesn&#x27;t think the film would have been a hit without the &quot;new&quot; ending. In 2014, Dearden penned a piece for &quot;The Guardian&quot; stating that while he does not regret writing the story, he does express his regret for the theatrical ending believing it to be sexist and the way Alex was portrayed in it stating that he didn&#x27;t want to make her a monster but rather &quot;a sad, tragic, lonely woman, holding down a tough job in an unforgiving city.&quot; When adapting his script to the stage, he opted to lean away from making her a villain and more a tragic figure.

The film&#x27;s first Japanese release used the original ending. The original ending also appeared on a special edition VHS and LaserDisc release by Paramount in 1992, and was included on the film&#x27;s DVD release a decade later.

===Home media===
A Special Collector&#x27;s Edition of the film was released on DVD in 2002. Paramount released &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; on Blu-ray Disc on June 9, 2009. The Blu-ray contained several bonus features from the 2002 DVD, including commentary by director Adrian Lyne, cast and crew interviews, a look at the film&#x27;s cultural phenomenon, a behind-the-scenes look, rehearsal footage, the alternative ending, and the original theatrical trailer. In April 2020 a remastered Blu-ray Disc was released by Paramount Home Entertainment under their Paramount Presents series. Included was a new interview with the director titled Filmmaker Focus, previous rehearsal footage but excluding some of the extra features from previous releases. Paramount released the film on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray in the U.S. on September 13, 2022.

==Reception==
===Box office ===
&quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; grossed $156.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $163.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $320.1 million.

The film spent eight weeks at number one in the United States, where it was the second-highest-grossing film of 1987, behind &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot;. In the United Kingdom, it grossed a record £2,048,421 in its opening week and spent ten weeks at number one. In Australia, it was the first non-Australian film to gross A$2 million in its opening week, second to &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot;. &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; eventually became the highest-grossing film worldwide in 1987.

=== Nominations ===
&quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; received 6 nominations at the 60th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (for Lyne), Best Actress (Close) and Best Supporting Actress (Archer), but failed to win any. At the 42nd British Academy Film Awards, the film won Best Editing, while earning nominations for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Douglas) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Archer). It also received four nominations at the 45th Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director (Lyne), Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama (Close) and Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture (Archer).

===Critical response===
 Audiences polled by &quot;CinemaScore&quot; gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an F to A+ scale.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded Lyne&#x27;s direction, writing that he &quot;takes a brilliantly manipulative approach to what might have been a humdrum subject and shapes a soap opera of exceptional power. Most of that power comes directly from visual imagery, for Mr. Lyne is well versed in making anythinga person, a room, a pile of dishes in a kitchen sinkseem tactile, rich and sexy.&quot; Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; stated that Close and Douglas &quot;gives the film some of its fatal attractiveness. So do James Dearden&#x27;s plausible, nicely observant script, Adrian Lyne&#x27;s elegantly unforced direction, and Close&#x27;s beautifully calibrated descent into lunacy. Together they bring horror home to a place where the grownup moviegoer actually lives.&quot;

Author Susan Faludi discussed the film in &quot;&quot;, arguing that major changes had been made to the original plot in order to make Alex wholly negative, while Dan&#x27;s carelessness and the lack of compassion and responsibility raised no discussion, except for a small number of men&#x27;s groups who said that Dan was eventually forced to own up to his irresponsibility in that &quot;everyone pays the piper&quot;. Close was quoted in 2008 as saying, &quot;Men still come up to me and say, &#x27;You scared the shit out of me.&#x27; Sometimes they say, &#x27;You saved my marriage. Critic Barry Norman expressed sympathy for feminists who were frustrated by the film, criticized its &quot;over-the-top&quot; ending and called it inferior to Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot;, which has a similar plot. Nonetheless, he declared it &quot;strong and very well made, excellently played by the three main characters and neatly written.&quot; &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; has been described as a neo-noir film by some authors.

&quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; was the first American film to be distributed by United International Pictures in South Korea. In September 1988, Korean film distributors protested this release by &quot;releasing snakes, setting fire in the theatres, and tearing off the screens.&quot;

Psychiatrists and film experts have analyzed the character of Alex Forrest and used her as an illustration of borderline personality disorder. She exhibits impulsive behavior, emotional instability, a fear of abandonment, frequent episodes of intense anger, self-harming, and shifting between idealization and devaluation of others, all of which are characteristic of the disorder. The degree to which she displays these traits is not necessarily typical, and aggression in people with borderline personality disorder is often directed toward themselves rather than others.

As referenced in Orit Kamir&#x27;s &quot;Every Breath You Take: Stalking Narratives and the Law&quot;, &quot;Glenn Close&#x27;s character Alex is quite deliberately made to be an erotomaniac.&quot; Gelder reports that Close &quot;consulted three separate shrinks for an inner profile of her character, who is meant to be suffering from a form of an obsessive condition known as de Clérambault&#x27;s syndrome&quot; (Gelder 1990, 93–94). The term &quot;&quot; is used to describe an obsessive, spurned woman, deriving from the scene where it is discovered that Alex has boiled the family&#x27;s pet rabbit.

<text>Chardon is a city in and the county seat of Geauga County, Ohio, United States. The population was 5,242 at the 2020 census. It is the only incorporated city in Geauga County, and includes land that was once part of Chardon, Hambden and Munson townships. It is located about 10 miles south of Lake Erie and within the &quot;snow belt&quot; of the Great Lakes and is part of the Cleveland metropolitan area.

==History==

Chardon is named after Peter Chardon Brooks, who donated land to build Chardon Square. Chardon Township celebrates its incorporation in 1812, and thus the City of Chardon does the same.

On July 24–25, 1868, a large fire destroyed the center of uptown, the area now known as Chardon Square. The fire originated in the Parlin Parkin&#x27;s grocery store, and spread rapidly. By the time the fire was contained, the courthouse, post office, and many stores on the square were destroyed. Damage was estimated at around $120,000. Chardon Square was quickly rebuilt following the fire. A new county courthouse, which still stands today, was completed in 1869. Many other buildings that were constructed after the fire also survive and are used today.

===School shooting===

On February 27, 2012, a student from Lake Academy in Willoughby, Ohio opened fire at the Chardon High School cafeteria, killing three and injuring two students. Daniel Parmertor, 16 years old, was killed at the time of the shooting. Two other victims, Demetrius Hewlin and Russell King, Jr., were pronounced dead on February 28. The shooter was taken into custody by police and was charged with three counts of aggravated murder. He was sentenced to three consecutive life terms in prison without parole.

In 1996, from November 9 through November 13, a storm dropped over of lake-effect snow in the city over a period of six days. Governor George Voinovich declared a state of emergency as a result, and the Ohio National Guard was brought in to assist with the cleanup.

Chardon is known for its maple syrup industry. Celebration of the syrup season begins at Tapping Sunday in March, when the sap is at prime thawing temperature. The annual Geauga County Maple Festival is a four-day celebration that takes place on the Chardon Square the last weekend in April. The festival has been rescheduled numerous times because of snowstorms in April due to Chardon&#x27;s location in the “snow belt” of the Great Lakes; it receives a large amount of snowfall every year.

Chardon has an active performance art community. The Geauga Lyric Theater Guild is housed in the renovated Geauga Theater building, which was constructed in 1939 as an Art Deco movie house. The theater is also being used again to show first-run movies.

Greater Chardon features numerous parks and golf courses. Chardon Lakes Golf Course is located in the heart of Chardon, two minutes from the square. Sand Ridge Golf Club in nearby Munson Township is also an excellent course. Chardon has an abundance of park space. Due to the area&#x27;s varying weather conditions, sports activities are available for every season.

<text>Middlefield is a village in Geauga County, Ohio, United States. The population was 2,748 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Cleveland metropolitan area. Middlefield is known for being the center of the world&#x27;s fourth largest Amish settlement, and its significant manufacturing base, which includes Gold Key Processing, Inc., Duncan Toys and KraftMaid. Because of its central location, home of the areas&#x27; public schools and prominent business and retail presence, Middlefield village is considered the hub community for Huntsburg, Parkman, and Middlefield Townships.

==History==

Once named &quot;Batavia,&quot; the village received its current name because it was the midway point between Painesville and Warren. Middlefield was established in 1799 by James Thompson and his father, Isaac Thompson, and incorporated in 1901.

Joseph Johnson settled north of Middlefield on what is now known as Johnson Corners in 1800. In 1818, James Thompson built a hotel. This hotel, later named The Century Inn, is currently the home of the Middlefield Historical Association. The Historical Association operates a small railroad museum in the summers, &quot;The Depot,&quot; focused on the 1873 narrow gauge railway between Painesville and Warren.

Middlefield&#x27;s first manufacturing company was the Johnson Pail Company, founded in 1895.

The Middlefield Library, a branch of the Geauga County Public Library, was opened in 1942.

In 1965, the Ukrainian Scouting Organization, Plast, established its midwestern campground known as &quot;Pysanyj Kamin&quot; occupying over 150 acres at the easternmost end of Shedd Rd in Middlefield Township. Three-week summer camps draw hundreds of Ukrainian American campers from Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., in addition to other North American cities and sometimes Ukraine.

Middlefield realizes more than 80% of its income tax from industrial and commercial business, making this Geauga county&#x27;s industrial capital. 

In 2005, Wal-Mart opened a Supercenter in the village. In order to cater to the local Amish population, the Supercenter has an expanded parking lot that includes 37 hitching posts for Amish buggies, and the store is stocked with blocks of ice and fabrics for clothes to be made at home.

==Geography==

<text>Fairborn is a city in Greene County, Ohio, United States. The population was 34,620 at the 2020 census. It is a suburb of Dayton and part of the Dayton metropolitan area. The city is home to Wright State University, which serves nearly 12,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The city also hosts the disaster training facility known informally as Calamityville.

It is the only city in the world named Fairborn, a portmanteau created from the names Fairfield and Osborn. After the Great Dayton Flood of 1913, the region and state created a conservation district here and, in the 1920s, began building Huffman Dam to control the Mad River. Residents of Osborn were moved with their houses to an area alongside Fairfield. In 1950, the two villages merged into the new city of Fairborn.

==History==

Fairborn was formed from the union in 1950 of the two villages of Fairfield and Osborn. Fairfield was founded by European Americans in 1816 and Osborn in 1850.

The area of the village of Fairfield was settled by European Americans before Ohio was admitted as a state. The first log cabin was built in 1799 by George Greiner. Pioneers migrating northward and westward from Kentucky and Virginia considered this area near the Mad River desirable for settlement. They were encroaching on territory of the native Shawnee, who sometimes raided the village. Settlers retaliated. No massacres were recorded but both sides engaged in taking prisoners.

Two local accounts relate to the origin of the name &quot;Fairfield&quot;. A local Native American chief, possibly a Shawnee, made peace and exchanged prisoners with leaders of the settlement. He said to William Cozad that, when he looked out from Reed&#x27;s Hill over the town, 

The other possible source for the name is after a Fairfield in England.

Nearby Osborn was named after the superintendent of the railroad named E.F. Osborn. The settlement allowed the railroad to be built through it after the nearby town of Fairfield had refused such construction. Many of the original houses of old Osborn can be found in Fairborn&#x27;s Historic Osborn District, where they were moved during the early 1920s.

From 1950 to 1970, the city grew to six times its former population, surpassing Xenia (the county seat) as the most populous city in the county, due largely to development and expansion of the nearby US Air Force Base. Southwestern Portland Cement, another major employer in the region, operated the largest factory in the city during this period, mining the locally exposed Brassfield Formation.

Until the mid-1960s, the city of Fairborn prohibited African Americans from living there and declared it was a sundown town. Officials at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base are credited with working with the city residents to end such policies, especially as the United States military was integrated beginning in 1948.

The development of Interstate 675 began in the 1960s to serve as an eastern bypass of Dayton. In the early 1970s, construction began on the northernmost part of I-675, just east of Fairborn. The first segment terminated at N. Fairfield Road (exit 17). No further construction was done for over a decade. This section was jokingly referred to by some as &quot;Fairborn&#x27;s private Interstate&quot;. Dayton Mayor James H. McGee opposed the highway, contending that it would draw economic development out of the city into the suburbs, a pattern that took place in many other cities. I-675 was eventually completed by 1987.

Fairborn&#x27;s growth slowed in the 1970s. It has resumed at a moderate pace since the late 1980s. It has since been surpassed by neighboring Beavercreek in population.

In 2007, many residents of Fairborn continue to work at nearby Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, the home of the Air Force Materiel Command. It has been described as the largest, most diverse and organizationally complex base in the Air Force.

Many also work at or attend Wright State University, a university that became independent in 1967. From a small cluster of buildings, it has grown into a major campus with almost 20,000 students. Though Wright State has a Dayton address, it is legally within Fairborn jurisdiction. Wright State University has its own Police officers, who are fully sworn through the State of Ohio.

Fairborn is the home of the largest elementary school in Ohio, Fairborn Primary School. Its students included children of military assigned to the Air Force base.

Fairborn hosts an annual Sweet Corn Festival every August and the USAF marathon every September. It also has an annual 4th of July Parade.

<text>Wilberforce is a census-designated place (CDP) in Greene County, Ohio, United States. The population was 2,410 at the 2020 census.

==History==
After Wilberforce College was established in 1856, the community was also named for the English statesman William Wilberforce, who worked for the abolition of slavery and achieved the end of the slave trade in the United Kingdom and its empire. The small community served as an important stop for refugee slaves on the Underground Railroad before the American Civil War, as it had seven stations.

The Ohio Historical Society operates the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center, which provides exhibits and learning opportunities for the regional community. The Association of African American Museums, also located in Wilberforce and supported by the private university, works to build professional capacity among smaller museums.

On April 3, 1974, during the 1974 Super Outbreak, a destructive F5 tornado moved through the area after exiting the nearby city of Xenia, where it destroyed many homes and businesses. The tornado severely damaged several structures in Wilberforce, including multiple campus and residential buildings of Wilberforce University. Central State University also sustained significant damage, and a water tower was toppled. As a result of the tornado, 32 people were killed, and about 1,150 people were injured.

==Geography==
Wilberforce is located in central Greene County and is bordered to the southwest by the city of Xenia, the county seat. Wilberforce is part of the Dayton Metropolitan Statistical Area.

U.S. Route 42 passes through the community, leading southwest to the center of Xenia and northeast to Cedarville. Downtown Dayton is to the west of Wilberforce.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.78%, is water.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,579 people, 189 households, and 133 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 220 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 84.17% African American, 11.21% White, 0.38% Native American, 0.13% Asian, 0.13% from other races, and 3.99% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.27% of the population.

There were 189 households, out of which 26.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.1% were married couples living together, 9.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.6% were non-families. 28.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 17.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.57 and the average family size was 3.14.

In the CDP the population was spread out, with 7.8% under the age of 18, 69.5% from 18 to 24, 9.4% from 25 to 44, 7.4% from 45 to 64, and 5.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 21 years. For every 100 females, there were 93.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.8 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $31,641, and the median income for a family was $39,038. Males had a median income of $4,706 versus $23,906 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $10,483. None of the families and 6.5% of the population were living below the poverty line, including no under eighteens and 16.3% of those over 64.

==Education==

The community has two historically black universities: Wilberforce University, with its associated Payne Theological Seminary, and Central State University.

===Wilberforce University===
Wilberforce University was established privately in 1856 as a joint project by the Methodist Episcopal Church of Cincinnati and African Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1863 the AME Church sold another property in order to buy the college after its temporary closing due to financial problems during the war. It was the first college to be owned and operated by African Americans. Bishop Daniel Payne, who led the founding and later purchase of the college, was its first president and served for many years. Many prominent scholars have taught there.

Among them was Charles Young, a West Point graduate and 19th-century US Army officer who served with the Buffalo Soldiers in the West and later taught at Wilberforce. Born into slavery, Young became the highest-ranking African-American officer in the US Army, a status that lasted until after World War I. His former residence, Youngsholm, has been designated as a National Historic Landmark and the Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers National Monument.

Their most famous graduate is Dorothy Vaughan, who is one of the women featured in Margot Lee Shetterly&#x27;s history Hidden Figures: The Story of the African-American Women Who Helped Win the Space Race (2016). It was adapted as a biographical film of the same name, also released in 2016.

===Central State University===
Central State University was established by the state legislature in 1887 as a commercial, normal and industrial department, which was located at Wilberforce in the late 19th century. In 1947, the department had expanded to four-year programs and it was established as a separate institution. With continued development, it achieved university status in 1965.

<doc id="129310" wikidata="Q1915576" url="?curid=129310" title="Xenia, Ohio">
<text>Xenia ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Greene County, Ohio, United States. Located in southwestern Ohio, it is east of Dayton and is part of the Dayton metropolitan area as well as the Miami Valley region. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 25,441. The city&#x27;s name comes from the Greek word Xenia (ξενία), which means &quot;hospitality&quot;.

==History==

Xenia was founded in 1803, the same year Ohio was admitted to the Union. In that year, Hollander-American pioneer John Paul bought of land from Thomas and Elizabeth Richardson of Hanover County, Virginia, for &quot;1050 pounds current moneys of Virginia.&quot; Paul influenced county commissioners to locate the county seat on this land at the forks of the Shawnee creeks, stimulating development of the settlement here.

Joseph C. Vance was named to survey the site and lay out the town. The following year, he bought the town site of from John Paul for $250. The name of the new village was chosen in typically democratic fashion. Vance called a town meeting to discuss possible names. The committee had considered several suggestions without reaching any decision. Then the Rev. Robert Armstrong proposed the name &quot;Xenia,&quot; meaning &quot;hospitality&quot; in Greek, because of the fine hospitality extended to him in this friendly community. When a tie vote occurred, Laticia Davis, wife of Owen Davis, was invited to cast the deciding ballot. She voted for &quot;Xenia.&quot;

The first session of the Ohio General Assembly created Greene County from the Northwest Territory. It took in the homeland of the Shawnee Indians. Their chief tribal village was north of Xenia at Old Chillicothe, now called Old Town. The Shawnee war chief Tecumseh was born there in 1768. The Catawba also lived in and around Xenia, many of their descendants, such as the Jeffries family, intermarried with the local free Black community and the White community as well.

William Beattie was Xenia&#x27;s first businessman. In 1804, he opened a tavern which became a center of community affairs. In 1804, John Marshall built Xenia&#x27;s first house. The first log school house was constructed in 1805, and, that same year, the Rev. James Towler became the town&#x27;s first postmaster. The growing community soon attracted many pioneer industries - flour mills, sawmills, woolen mills, pork packing plants, oil mills, and tow mills.

A petition for incorporation, dated March 24, 1817, was circulated among the 88 households of Xenia, and on July 21, 1817, that petition, containing 66 signatures, was filed with the Court of Common Pleas of Greene County. On October 27, 1817, the petition for incorporation was granted by the Court and Xenia became a municipal corporation.

The arrival of the Little Miami Railroad (now the site of the Little Miami Scenic Trail, which passed through Xenia Station) in 1843, stimulated the development of additional industries and connected the city to other markets. On March 2, 1850, the Ohio General Assembly rode from Columbus, Ohio to Xenia and back on the newly completed Columbus and Xenia Railroad.

From the summer of 1851, tourists would come from Cincinnati, as well as plantations from the South, to visit the nearby Xenia Springs and Tawawa House, a hotel and health spa about three miles away. It was established as a summer resort to draw on interest in the medicinal properties of the springs. Skin specialist Dr. Samuel Spilsbee from Cincinnati served as Superintendent of the hotel. It was three stories high, and the grounds of the complex also included separate cottages. After it went out of business, the complex was purchased for use as Wilberforce College, a historically black college founded by a collaboration between the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) and the Cincinnati Conference of the Methodist Church. By 1860 most of the 200 students were mixed-race children of wealthy white fathers from the South, planters and businessmen who were prevented from getting them educated there. In the early years of the war, the college closed briefly after Southerners withdrew their children. The AME Church took it over, and continued to operate it.

On Wednesday morning, February 13, 1861, President-Elect Abraham Lincoln made a brief appearance in the city as his inaugural train traveled from Cincinnati east to Columbus. He gave a short speech; the traveling reporter from the &quot;New York Times&quot; did not record it as Lincoln expressed sentiments that he had repeated in previous stops. According to the &quot;Times&quot; writer, &quot;a very large crowd assembled, and amid the firing of a cannon and enthusiasm, Mr. Lincoln addressed them from the rear car, reiterating what he had said before.&quot;.

The town progressed rapidly during the mid-19th century. Artificial gas was provided in the 1840s and continued in use until natural gas was made available in 1905. The first fire engine house was built in 1831; the telephone came to Xenia in 1879; electricity in 1881 and a water works system in 1886. Xenia opened its first free public library in 1899. By 1900, the city was operating its own sewage system.

Following the Civil War, the Ohio Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Orphans&#x27; Home was built in Xenia. Some of its building remains in use by a Christian ministry organization.

Xenia elected Cornelius Clark as its first mayor in 1834. On January 1, 1918, the current city commission-manager plan succeeded the old form of municipal government.

===Tornadoes===
Xenia has a history of severe storm activity. According to local legend, the Shawnee referred to the area as &quot;the place of the devil wind&quot; or &quot;the land of the crazy winds&quot; (depending upon the translation).
On April 3, 1974, a verified F5 rated tornado on the Fujita scale cut a path directly through the middle of Xenia during the 1974 Super Outbreak, the second largest series of tornadoes in recorded history. The disaster killed 34 people (including two Ohio National Guardsmen who died days later in a related fire), injured an additional 1,150, destroyed almost half of the city&#x27;s buildings, and left 10,000 people homeless. Five schools, including Xenia High School, Central Junior High School, McKinley Elementary, Simon Kenton Elementary, and Saint Brigid Catholic School were destroyed, as were nine churches and 180 businesses. Ted Fujita himself rated the tornado an F6 in an essay he wrote, but the rating was never confirmed.

The city&#x27;s plight was featured in the national news, including a 1974 NBC television documentary, &quot;Tornado!&quot;, hosted by Floyd Kalber. President Richard Nixon visited stricken areas of Xenia following the devastation. Comedian Bob Hope organized a benefit to raise funds for Xenia and, in appreciation, the new Xenia High School Auditorium was named the &quot;Bob Hope Auditorium.&quot; In recognition of their coverage of this tornado, the staff of the &quot;Xenia Daily Gazette&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Reporting in 1975.

Xenia was struck by an F2 tornado on April 25, 1989, and again by an F4 tornado on September 20, 2000. The 1989 tornado caused over $2 million (~$ in ) in damage, but no one was killed. The twister of 2000 killed one person, and injured 100 people. This tornado followed a path roughly parallel to that of the 1974 tornado.

Xenia currently has a system of tornado sirens. After the 1974 tornado outbreak, the city purchased a system of five Federal Signal Thunderbolt sirens for warning. During the 2000 tornado strike, the lack of backup power silenced the Thunderbolts during emergency, so the city purchased five Federal Signal 2001-SRNB series sirens with battery backup to reinforce/replace the Thunderbolts.

===Railroads===

Several railroad lines owned by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio (B&amp;O) and Pennsylvania (PRR) railroads once served Xenia, for both freight and passenger service. Since restructuring of the railroad industry in the mid-twentieth century, all lines have since been abandoned, the last being dismantled by 1989.

The lines that previously served Xenia were:
* B&amp;O Wellston subdivision, between Washington Court House and Dayton.
* PRR Little Miami branch, between Cincinnati and Springfield; a portion of the line ran down Detroit Street and was the first section to be dismantled.
* PRR Pittsburgh-St. Louis mainline; Amtrak operated the &quot;National Limited&quot; passenger service over this line until 1979.

The roadbeds of five of Xenia&#x27;s six rail lines were converted for rail trail use. The one exception — the B&amp;O line west of town — was not converted because it closely paralleled the PRR mainline for most of its length.

Xenia was served by two interurban railways until the 1940s:
* Dayton &amp; Xenia Transit Company
* Springfield &amp; Xenia Railway
In the postwar period, automobile ownership increased, and the federal government subsidized the construction of numerous interstate highways. Both changes influenced the decline of regional transit, such as the interurban railways.

==Geography==
Today Xenia is centrally located in the &quot;transportation triangle&quot; formed by three major interstate highways: I-70, I-71, and I-75. These north-south, east–west arteries are within minutes of Xenia via U.S. Routes 35, 42, and 68, tying the community to one of the nation&#x27;s largest 90-minute highway markets. Before the creation of the U.S. Interstate Highway system, U.S. 68 was one of the main southward routes from the major city of Detroit, Michigan. Within Xenia, U.S. 68 is named &quot;Detroit Street&quot;.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

The main newspaper in Xenia is the &quot;Xenia Daily Gazette&quot;, founded in 1868. The &quot;Gazette&quot; is published two days a week.

<text>Yellow Springs is a village in northern Greene County, Ohio, United States. The population was 3,697 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Dayton metropolitan area and is home to Antioch College.

==History==

In 1825, the village was founded by William Mills and approximately 100 families, followers of Robert Owen, who wanted to emulate the utopian community at New Harmony, Indiana. The village was named after nearby natural springs with waters high in iron content. The communitarian efforts dissolved due to internal conflicts.

The completion of the Little Miami Railroad in 1846 brought increased commerce, inhabitants, and tourism to this area of Greene County. Many regular visitors of the 19th century came for the springs, as these were believed to have medicinal benefits. The village of Yellow Springs was incorporated in 1856.

===Antioch College===

Antioch College was founded in 1850 by the Christian Connection, and began operating in 1853 with the distinguished scholar Horace Mann as its first president.

In 1920, Arthur E. Morgan became president of Antioch College; he was known for his innovations and implemented a much-imitated work-study program for students. An engineer by training, Morgan left Antioch to become head of the Tennessee Valley Authority during President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s administration. Upon his return to Yellow Springs, Morgan was a key leader of Quaker intentional community developments in Ohio and North Carolina.

In 1926, the Antioch Company was founded by two then-current Antioch College students as &quot;The Antioch Bookplate Company&quot;. The company expanded to selling children&#x27;s books, gifts, and craft products, In 2008, the company sold off its Antioch Publishing business, and focused the remaining business on the company&#x27;s Creative Memories brand of custom framing and scrapbooking items. The remaining Yellow Spring facility of Creative Memories closed in 2012.

Antioch College expanded beginning in 1964, to include 38 &quot;centers&quot; around the country by the end of 1979. Its by-laws were changed to define Antioch as a &quot;network&quot;, not a college, owned by Antioch University Corporation. In 1986, 32 of its units around the country were closed, leaving six campuses, which included both its original College campus in Yellow Springs and the college&#x27;s School of Adult and Experiential Learning there. It operated separately as Antioch University McGregor. That adult and graduate education school was renamed as Antioch University Midwest in 1988. It closed in late 2020.

In 2008, citing financial exigency, the university closed the college campus in Yellow Springs. College alumni, forming the Antioch College Continuation Corporation, bought back the college&#x27;s name and campus. They reopened in 2011 as the independent Antioch College.

Now, Antioch University and Antioch College are wholly separate institutions.

===Freed slaves===
The Conway Colony, a group of 30 freed slaves who were transported by Moncure D. Conway, the abolitionist son of their former owner, were settled in this village in 1862.

Wheeling Gaunt, a former slave who had purchased his own freedom, came to Yellow Springs in the 1860s. By his death in 1894, he owned a substantial amount of land. Gaunt bequeathed to the village a large piece of land on its western side, requesting that the rent be used to buy flour for the &quot;poor and worthy widows&quot; of Yellow Springs. Although the land was used to create Gaunt Park, and thus does not generate rent, the village expanded the bequest to include sugar. It still delivers flour and sugar to the village&#x27;s widows at Christmas time, a tradition that generates annual media coverage.

===Activism===
During the Red Scare of the 1950s, Yellow Springs and Antioch College came under scrutiny for alleged sympathies of faculty and students to the Communist Party, due to many locals&#x27; support of left-wing politics. After being questioned by the Ohio House Un-American Activities Committee, Antioch president Douglas McGregor released a statement in 1952 that &quot;Antioch upholds the American tradition of academic freedom. This means the right to hear and investigate all sides of any question, including the question of Russia and Communism&quot;.

By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the village became a center of activity for the Civil Rights Movement and anti-war movement in southwestern Ohio. Villagers have retained a progressive cast in their politics, attracting new residents with similar ideas and establishing a unique sociopolitical demographic element in a primarily conservative region of the state.

In 1979, Yellow Springs held the distinction of being the smallest municipality to pass an ordinance prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation. As of 2014, it had the largest LGBT population of all Ohio&#x27;s villages.

==Geography==

The village takes its name from a nearby natural spring whose waters are rich in iron, leaving a yellowish-orange coloring on the rocks. Now included within the nearby Glen Helen Nature Preserve, in the mid-19th century, it became the center of a resort. During this period, many individuals traveled to areas of such springs, believing the waters had medicinal benefits.

<text>Hope and Glory is a 1987 comedy-drama war film written, produced, and directed by John Boorman based on his own experiences growing up in London during World War II. It was distributed by Columbia Pictures. The title is derived from the traditional British patriotic song &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;. The film tells the story of the Rohan family and their experiences, as seen through the eyes of the son, Billy (Sebastian Rice-Edwards).

A critical and commercial success, the film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay (all for Boorman). It also received 13 BAFTA Award nominations, winning for Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Susan Wooldridge).

==Plot==
The film begins on 3 September 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany. It tells the story of the Rohan family (Billy, his sisters Sue and Dawn, and his parents Grace and Clive), who live in a suburb of London. Clive joins the army, leaving Grace alone to watch over the children. She almost sends Billy and Susie away from London, but pulls them back on the train platform when she realizes she cannot bear to be apart from them. Thus, Billy stays in London for the first years of the war.

Seen through the eyes of 10-year-old Billy, the &quot;fireworks&quot; provided by the Blitz (September 1940 – May 1941) every night are as exciting as they are terrifying, and the ruins they leave are a fascinating playground for Billy and other boys his age, who are largely unsupervised. The nightly raids do not provide the only drama, as Billy&#x27;s older sister, Dawn, falls for Canadian soldier Bruce, becomes pregnant, and, finding her life turned upside down, discovers the value of her family.

When the Rohans&#x27; house burns down (due to an ordinary fire), the family moves to the bucolic Thames-side home of Grace&#x27;s parents. This provides an opportunity for Billy to spend more time with his curmudgeonly Grandfather George, who teaches him &quot;the ways of the river&quot;.

In the autumn of 1942, Winston Churchill delivers his famous &quot;end of the beginning&quot; speech. Bruce returns from his secret posting and goes AWOL to find Dawn. Immediately after they are married in the village church, MPs take Bruce away. That afternoon in the living room of her grandparents&#x27; house, Dawn gives birth to a son.

Although Grace has rented a house for the family just down the river, Billy must go back to London until he can get into the local school. George drives the boy to his old school, only to find the block filled with ecstatic children, as a stray bomb has destroyed the building. George drives Billy home. The adult Billy recalls: &quot;In all my life, nothing ever quite matched the perfect joy of that moment. My school lay in ruins, and the river beckoned with the promise of stolen days.&quot; The credits roll over imagery of the river, to the music of &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;.

==Cast==

John Boorman provides the voice of the film&#x27;s narrator. Boorman&#x27;s daughter, Katrine Boorman, appears as Charity (one of Grace&#x27;s sisters), while his son, Charley Boorman, appears as the downed Luftwaffe pilot.

==Production==
===Filming locations===
According to TCM-host Dave Karger&#x27;s afterword to an April 2021 broadcast of the film, Boorman re-created the street on which he lived. The million-dollar, 40-acre set was the largest constructed in England since World War II. The main film set was built on the disused runway at the former Wisley Airfield in Surrey, and the scenes by the river were shot near Shepperton Lock. Filming also took place in Hightown Road, Ringwood, Hampshire, and at Bray Studios in Berkshire.

===Archival footage===
The &quot;newsreel&quot; footage that Bill sees at the local cinema in the film contains scenes from the 1969 film &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;.

==Critical response==
&quot;Hope and Glory&quot; received very positive reviews at the time of its release, and was named one of the best films of 1987 by over 50 critics. Only &quot;Broadcast News&quot; appeared on more top 10 lists in 1987.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 96% &quot;Fresh&quot; score based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 86 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The film was favourably reviewed by critic Pauline Kael in her film reviews collection &quot;Hooked&quot;:
Critic Emanuel Levy&#x27;s review was also positive, writing: &quot;Director John Boorman offers a warmly nostalgic view of his childhood in a London suburb during WWII.&quot;

In 1987, Roger Ebert wrote:
==Box office==
Goldcrest Films invested £1,288,000 in the film and received £1,665,000, making them a profit of £377,000.

The film made £845,927 in the UK.

==Awards and nominations==
==Sequel==
A sequel to the film, titled &quot;Queen and Country&quot;, was made in 2014. The sequel tells the story of an older Bill Rohan as a soldier during the Korean War. It was selected to be screened as part of the Directors&#x27; Fortnight section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, and received a general theatrical release in 2015.

<doc id="129313" wikidata="Q509549" url="?curid=129313" title="Fort Meade">
<text>Fort George G. Meade is a United States Army installation located in Maryland, that includes the Defense Information School, the Defense Media Activity, the United States Army Field Band, and the headquarters of United States Cyber Command, the National Security Agency, the Defense Courier Service, Defense Information Systems Agency headquarters, and the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Cryptologic Warfare Group Six. It is named for George G. Meade, a Union general from the American Civil War, who served as commander of the Army of the Potomac. The fort&#x27;s smaller census-designated place includes support facilities such as schools, housing, and the offices of the Military Intelligence Civilian Excepted Career Program (MICECP).
==History==
===20th century===
Initially called Camp Annapolis Junction, the post was opened as &quot;Camp Admiral&quot; in 1917 on acquired for a training camp. The post was called Camp Meade Cantonment by 1918, Camp Franklin Signal Corps school was located there and in 1919, the Camp Benning tank school—formed from the World War I Camp Colt and Tobyhanna schools—was transferred to the fort before the Tank Corps was disbanded.

Renamed to Fort Leonard Wood (February 1928 – March 5, 1929), the fort&#x27;s Experimental Motorized Forces in the summer and fall of 1928 tested vehicles and tactics in expedition convoys (Camp Meade observers had joined the in-progress 1919 Motor Transport Corps convoy). In 1929, the fort&#x27;s 1st Tank Regiment encamped on the Gettysburg Battlefield.

During World War II, Fort Meade was used as a recruit training post and prisoner of war camp, in addition to a holding center for approximately 384 Japanese, German, and Italian immigrant residents of the U.S. arrested as potential fifth columnists. The Second U.S. Army Headquarters transferred to the post on June 15, 1947; and in 1957, the post became headquarters of the National Security Agency.

====Cold War air defense====
From the 1950s until the 1970s, the Fort Meade radar station had various radar equipment and control systems for air defense, such as the 1st Martin AN/FSG-I Antiaircraft Defense System. Fort Meade also had the first Nike Ajax surface-to-air missiles in December 1953 (operational May 1954) and an accidental firing occurred in 1955 with Battery C, 36th AAA Missile Battalion. In 1962, the Army&#x27;s Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 13th Air Defense Artillery Group, transferred from Meade to Homestead AFB for initial deployment of MIM-23 Hawk missiles, and during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the 6th Battalion (HAWK), 65th Artillery at Fort Meade (a United States Strike Command unit) was deployed to the Miami/Key West area (the 8th Battalion (Hawk) was at the fort in late 1964). Fort Meade bomb disposal experts were dispatched to secure nuclear bombs in the 1964 Savage Mountain B-52 crash.

In 1977, a merger organized the fort&#x27;s U.S. Army Intelligence Agency as part of the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command. On October 1, 1991, a wing of the Air Force Intelligence Command transferred to Fort Meade, and the organization was replaced by the 70th Operations Group on May 1, 2005. In the early 1990s, was transferred from the post to the Patuxent Research Refuge. A planned closure of the post in the 1990s was not implemented, and the Defense Information School moved to the fort in 1995. The 311th Signal Command headquarters was at Fort Meade from 1996 to September 2006. 

===21st century===
The 70th Intelligence Wing headquarters was established at Fort Meade on July 17, 2000, and the Base Realignment and Closure, 2005, designated Fort Meade to gain 5,700 positions. Fort Meade currently has more than 54,000 employees (service members and civilians), and is the largest employer in the state of Maryland and second largest installation by employee population in the Army.

After an August 27, 2007, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency order to assess the contamination at 14 hazardous waste sites on Fort Meade, such as an ordnance disposal area, 1940s waste dump, closed sanitary landfill, a September 2007 environmental impact report identified adding two golf courses would be a &quot;significant threat to the biological and territorial integrity of the Patuxent Research Refuge&quot;. The US Army responded that it is &quot;taking steps to limit the environmental damage.&quot;

===Defense Information Systems Agency===
After United States Cyber Command was established at the post in 2009; on April 15, 2011, the Defense Information Systems Agency ribbon-cutting for the move from Arlington County, Virginia, was at the agency&#x27;s Fort Meade complex of .

===Defense Information School===

The consolidation of the Defense Information School and the Defense Visual Information School in fiscal 1996 and further consolidation with the Defense Photography School in fiscal 1998 created a single focal point in the Department of Defense for these specialties fields. Advancements in information technology and recent base realignment and closure initiatives have contributed to the evolution of the school. The result is a single school proud of its historical roots and dedicated to serving the diverse requirements for public affairs, broadcasting and visual information.

===Security incidents===
Alleged gunman Hong Young was arrested in connection with shootings at five public places in Maryland, including an NSA building, theaters and occupied vehicles in late February 2015. No motive has been established but his estranged wife attributed his behavior to mental issues, and he told police he heard voices telling him to shoot at a random driver.

On March 30, 2015, National Security Agency police officers shot and killed a person who attempted to drive an SUV through a restricted entrance to the NSA campus in Fort Meade, Maryland. A passenger in the SUV was injured, as was an officer, and both were treated at a hospital. President Obama was briefed but the FBI determined &quot;we do not believe it is related to terrorism.&quot;

On February 14, 2018, National Security Agency police officers shot and wounded an individual who rammed an SUV into a barricade near an entry gate outside of the facility. In the immediate aftermath of the event, the NSA announced that there was &quot;no ongoing security or safety threat.&quot;

==Geography==
Fort Meade is bordered by the Baltimore–Washington Parkway on the west and is about east of Interstate 95. It is located between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. It is located in proximity to Odenton, Columbia, Jessup, Hanover, Laurel, and Severn.

==Library of Congress==
Fort Meade is used as a storage facility for the United States Library of Congress.

In 1994, a site located in the U.S. Army Base at Fort Meade, MD was transferred to the U.S. Congress to provide additional storage capacity for the Library of Congress and other legislative bodies. The current master plan includes the land to construct up to 13 Phased Storage Modules for collections, if this number is needed.

In subsequent years, Congress provided construction funds in the Architect of the Capitol budget for Module 1, completed in 2002, for Module 2, completed in 2005 and Modules 3 and 4 and four cold storage rooms, completed in 2009. A full-scale three-year transfer program of the special format collections to Modules 3 and 4 and the four cold storage rooms began in Spring 2010 and was completed in September 2012. Module 5 has been fully funded with occupancy scheduled for September 2017.

The state-of-the art storage modules are being built to store, preserve and protect the library&#x27;s collections. Collections include books and bound periodicals as well as special format collections, such as maps, manuscripts, prints, photographs, sheet music, and microfilm masters. If needed and constructed, the 13 collections storage modules will provide a total of 180,600 gross sq ft of archival storage space for the library&#x27;s collections.

==Museums==

The Fort George G. Meade Museum exhibited the post&#x27;s historical artifacts, including uniforms, insignia, and equipment. The museum also had a small collection of vehicles, including a Renault FT, a MK VIII Liberty Tank, an M3A1 Stuart, an M4A3E8 Sherman, an M41 Walker Bulldog, an M47 Patton, armored personnel carriers such as an M113, M114, M84, a Nike Ajax missile, and a UH-1H helicopter. The Fort George G. Meade Community Council noted in July 2018 that the museum would close, with artifacts relocated to the National Museum of the United States Army under construction in Fort Belvoir, Virginia.

==Transportation==
Since 2005, the NSA operates a shuttle service from the Odenton station of MARC to its Visitor Control Center at Fort Meade. In 2009, the U.S. Army established a similar shuttle service from the Odenton station to the Army section of Fort Meade; the NSA operates this service, allowing garrison employees, persons with Fort Meade visitor passes, and U.S. Department of Defense IDs to board.

==Housing concerns==
In February 2019, Secretary of the Army Mark Esper, Chief of Staff Mark Milley, and Sgt. Maj. of the Army Daniel A. Dailey met with the commander of IMCOM, the Fort Meade garrison commander, and Army families over safety concerns with housing units on the base in which residents were exposed to lead and asbestos. After speaking with the CEO for the company which manages the house maintenance of the installation, the senior leaders of the Army will determine necessary actions. &quot;We are deeply troubled by the recent reports highlighting the deficient conditions in some of our family housing. It is unacceptable for our families who sacrifice so much to have to endure these hardships in their own homes.&quot;—Secretary of the Army, Mark T. Esper and Chief of Staff of the Army, Gen. Mark A. Milley

<text>Cambridge (kaym-brij) is a city in and the county seat of Guernsey County, Ohio, United States. It lies in southeastern Ohio, in the Appalachian Plateau of the Appalachian Mountains about east of Columbus and approximately south of Cleveland. The population was 10,089 at the 2020 census. It is the principal city of the Cambridge micropolitan area and is located adjacent to the intersection of Interstates 70 and 77.

Cambridge is well known among glass collectors as being the location for the Cambridge Glass, Boyd Glass and Mosser Glass plants. The Cambridge area is also noted for its S-shaped bridges, dating back to the building of the National Road in 1828.

==History==

In 1796, Col. Ebenezer Zane received funds to blaze a road suitable for travel by horse through the Ohio wilderness from a point on the Ohio River opposite Wheeling, Virginia (now Wheeling, West Virginia) to another point opposite Maysville, Kentucky. Where this road, known as Zane&#x27;s Trace, crossed Wills Creek, a ferry was established in 1798. This was followed by the first bridge authorized by the legislature of the Northwest Territory, built in 1803. The land on which part of Cambridge stands was granted to Zaccheus Biggs and Zaccheus Beatty by the government in 1801. A settlement grew up at the creek crossing. The town of Cambridge was platted there in 1806. Both Cambridge, Maryland and Cambridge, Massachusetts have been speculated by historians as having inspired the naming of the town. Also in 1806, another group of early settlers from the Isle of Guernsey in the English Channel pitched camp in Cambridge, reportedly because the women in the party refused to move on. The county for which Cambridge serves as the county seat was later named in honor of its many settlers from Guernsey. In 1828, the federally built National Road came through Cambridge. The first railroad arrived in 1854. The Cambridge area experienced massive flooding in late June 1998. In 1973, Buds Pub was built.

==Geography==
Cambridge is located along Wills Creek; its tributary Leatherwood Creek flows into Wills Creek in the southern part of the city.

<text>Addyston is a village in Miami Township, Hamilton County, Ohio, United States. Located along the Ohio River, it is a western suburb of the neighboring city of Cincinnati. The population was 927 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Established in 1891, Addyston was named after Matthew Addy, who had founded the Addyston Pipe and Steel Company in the 1880s. Addyston served as a company town for Addy&#x27;s foundry, with nearly 80% of the village&#x27;s homes rented by Pipe and Steel Company workers by the early 1900s. In 1894, the company entered into a cartel with other pipe manufacturers in which they agreed not to compete with each other in order to increase the price of their products. The cartel was the subject of an 1899 US Supreme Court antitrust case, &quot;Addyston Pipe &amp; Steel Co. v. United States&quot;. Addyston was devastated by the Ohio River flood of 1937. The closure of the Pipe and Steel Company in the 1950s resulted in population loss and the blighting of many of the village&#x27;s buildings, particularly in the Sekitan neighborhood. Monsanto began operating at the site of Addy&#x27;s foundry in 1952, followed by Bayer in 1995, Lanxess in 2005, and Ineos in 2007. In 1991, part of Addyston was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Village of Addyston Historic District. 

Addyston&#x27;s industrial plant has contributed to high levels of pollution in the surrounding area. In addition to dumping many of its chemicals into the Ohio River, the plant has made use of several landfills in the region. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) attempted to designate the plant&#x27;s Bond Road Landfill in Whitewater Township as a superfund site due to its extensive pollution in the 1990s, but this was rejected by the federal EPA. The plant has produced or used numerous carcinogens over its history, including acrylonitrile, butadiene, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Addyston&#x27;s Meredith Hitchens Elementary School ceased operations following a 2005 report by the Ohio EPA that found a significantly heightened risk of cancer at the school due to pollution from the nearby plant. Its students were transferred to the Three Rivers School District, whose closest school was in Cleves. In 2009, Ineos and Lanxess agreed to spend $2 million to address the pollution in a deal with the EPA. The Addyston plant was cited in a 2021 lawsuit by the state of Ohio against Monsanto for PCB pollution. A Monsanto spokesperson confirmed that the Addyston plant made use of PCBs, but stated that they were not produced at the plant.

Many residents in the Cincinnati area regarded Addyston as a speed trap as early as 1948, which village officials repeatedly denied. An article in &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; stated that its reputation as a speed trap was &quot;mostly true&quot;, citing the fact that Addyston&#x27;s mayor&#x27;s court saw more than five times as many traffic cases per 100 residents than the average mayor&#x27;s court in Ohio between 2017 and 2019. Addyston&#x27;s police department issued 604 traffic tickets in 2019, which the &quot;Enquirer&quot; contrasted with the fact that U.S. Route 50 only passes through the village for two miles. In March 2020, Addyston Police Chief Dorian LaCourse resigned after it was revealed that he had sold over 60 submachine guns that he had acquired from gun salesmen in Indiana under the guise of using them for police demonstrations.

In 2021, Addyston&#x27;s financial situation was referred to as a &quot;record-keeping train wreck&quot; by Ohio State Auditor Keith Faber. In October 2024, Ineos announced plans to close its plant in Addyston in the second quarter of 2025, stating that the plant was &quot;no longer economical&quot;. Ineos violated the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act by failing to inform the US Department of Labor of its intention to close. The Ineos plant made up about a fourth of Addyston&#x27;s annual revenue, paying $350,000 in income tax and $21,000 in property tax per year. The announcement of its closure deepened the village&#x27;s financial crisis and raised media speculation about Addyston&#x27;s potential dissolution and reabsorption into Miami Township. On November 12, 2024, the Addyston village council voted 4-3 to disband the village&#x27;s police department and hand over law enforcement responsibility to the Hamilton County Sheriff&#x27;s Office in order to reduce costs. In the wake of the disbandment, Addyston Police Chief Jacob Tenbrink suggested that dissolving into Miami Township may be necessary, though Miami Township Administrator Jim Brett expressed his desire for Addyston to remain independent. 

By January 2025, informal talks had begun between Addyston and Cincinnati to discuss holding a referendum on the village&#x27;s annexation into Cincinnati, with Addyston Mayor Lisa Mear describing herself as &quot;on the fence&quot; about annexation. Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval stated that the city wished to explore the effects annexation would have on Cincinnati&#x27;s finances and public services. The negotiations were arranged by Bill Seitz, who had formerly served as a Republican member of the Ohio House of Representatives. A majority of the village council expressed their opposition to annexation at a February council meeting, but stated that no firm decision had been made regarding the village&#x27;s future and that extensive funding cuts were needed to maintain the village&#x27;s independence.

<doc id="129328" wikidata="Q2395100" url="?curid=129328" title="Arlington Heights, Ohio">
<text>Arlington Heights is a village in Hamilton County, Ohio, United States. It is a northeastern suburb of Cincinnati. The population was 823 at the 2020 census. The village is almost completely contained within the wide median of the Mill Creek Expressway (Interstate 75), one of the few urban splits of freeway lanes in the country.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

==Government==
The current mayor of Arlington Heights is Steven Crase.

In 2011, Arlington Heights issued 4,037 traffic tickets. Arlington Heights uses a Mayor&#x27;s Court, whereby the mayor or his designate presides over traffic ticket cases. Arlington Heights&#x27; mayor&#x27;s court had 5.91 cases per capita, (third highest in Ohio) compared to the state average of 0.2.

===Theft indictment===
In July 2012 two former Arlington Heights employees, Donna Covert and her daughter Laura Jarvis, were indicted by a Hamilton County grand jury on charges relating to the theft of roughly $260,000 from village coffers from 2007 to 2010. The charges were the result of a two-year investigation by the Ohio Attorney General and the Ohio State Auditor after Robert Lawson, the Arlington Heights police chief, reported his concerns in January 2010.

Although the grand jury indictment covers only the 2007 to 2010 time span, some former officials including a former council member Roland M. Heyne Jr. who successfully sued the village for civil rights violations, contend that cash payments of fines had been systematically stolen as long as 10 years prior. Mark Groteke, a former Arlington Heights police chief, stated, &quot;They were stealing money. We knew it — there was discussion among the police officers — we knew that they were stealing money.&quot; In a September 2002 letter to Mayor Joseph Harper, which copied Steve Surber (then the village treasurer), Groteke discussed &quot;... the possibility that citations may have been improperly handled&quot;, and recommended &quot;... an outside independent agency should do a complete audit of all tickets written for at least the last 12 months.&quot; Despite the warning, no action was taken by village officials. Seeing this, the police chief requested an investigation from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation. According to Groteke, the investigation was not launched because approval from either the mayor or the treasurer was required, and each refused to endorse an investigation.

In 2007, the new police chief, Robert Lawson, also voiced concerns about the handling of money within the village. He sent an email to Surber (still the village treasurer), saying &quot;Just a quick review of the MUTT book, your numbers don&#x27;t add up...&quot; (MUTT stands for &quot;Multi-count Uniform Traffic Ticket&quot;.) Again, no investigation followed.

When asked about the prior letters, Surber said his position as clerk treasurer did not give him the power to call for an investigation.

In 2012, Hamilton County prosecutor Joe Deters called for the village to be shut down. He said, &quot;The Village Council needs to seriously consider dissolving the Village of Arlington Heights. The Village seems to be nothing more than a speed trap with no checks and balances… Consolidating with another political subdivision is long overdue.&quot;

On January 1, 2016, the Village&#x27;s police department was disbanded and the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office took over law enforcement functions. In 2018 The Hamilton County Sheriff’s office stopped patrolling the village. Arlington Heights is now patrolled by The City Of Reading Police Department.

<doc id="129329" wikidata="Q885619" url="?curid=129329" title="Blue Ash, Ohio">
<text>Blue Ash is a city in Hamilton County, Ohio. An inner suburb of Cincinnati, the population was 13,394 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
The area that is now Blue Ash was settled around 1791. In 1797, the first settlers built Carpenter&#x27;s Run Baptist Church out of blue ash logs, giving the area its eventual name.

In the late 19th century, the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway provided narrow-gauge commuter rail service to Blue Ash.

Blue Ash was the site of Cincinnati–Blue Ash Airport from 1921 to 2012. Originally a private airfield called Grisard Field, it was sold to the City of Cincinnati in 1946, becoming Ohio&#x27;s first municipal airport. Cincinnati desired to expand the airport for major commercial service through the 1950s, but Blue Ash fought the city by incorporating first as a village in 1955 and then as a city in 1961. Eventually, through Reed Hartman&#x27;s Community Improvement Corporation, Cincinnati developed the surrounding area as an industrial park and golf course. The airport closed on August 29, 2012, and the property was sold to the City of Blue Ash, which opened Summit Park on the property.

In 1998, the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority proposed a MetroMoves light rail system with a Green Line that would initially run from Blue Ash to Covington, Kentucky. A future phase would have extended the line further north to Kings Island and south to the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. However, MetroMoves was rejected by Hamilton County voters.

On April 9, 1999, Blue Ash experienced an F4 tornado that caused four deaths.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, the city has a total area of , of which (or 99.87%) is land and (or 0.13%) is water.

Blue Ash can be reached by Interstate 71 to the east, Interstate 275 to the north, and Ronald Reagan Cross County Highway to the south.

It stars Cher as a widowed Italian American woman who falls in love with her fiancé&#x27;s hot-tempered, estranged younger brother, played by Nicolas Cage. The supporting cast includes Danny Aiello, Olympia Dukakis and Vincent Gardenia.

&quot;Moonstruck&quot; had a limited theatrical release on December 18, 1987, and was released nationally on January 15, 1988 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The film earned critical and commercial success. It received six nominations at the 60th Academy Awards, winning three for Best Actress (Cher), Best Supporting Actress (Dukakis), and Best Original Screenplay (Shanley).

== Plot ==
Thirty-seven year old Loretta Castorini, an Italian-American widow, works as a bookkeeper and lives in Brooklyn Heights with her parents, Cosmo and Rose, and her paternal grandfather. Loretta&#x27;s boyfriend, Johnny Cammareri, proposes to her before leaving for Sicily to tend to his dying mother. Loretta accepts, but she insists on carefully following tradition as she believes failing to do so originally led to her first husband&#x27;s sudden death after two years of marriage.

Johnny asks Loretta to invite his estranged younger brother Ronny to the wedding; Ronny and Johnny have not spoken in five years. Loretta returns home and informs her parents of the engagement. Cosmo, who runs a successful plumbing business, dislikes Johnny and is reluctant to pay for Loretta&#x27;s planned &quot;real&quot; wedding. Hearing that Loretta likes but does not love Johnny, Rose tells her that true love can cause romantic partners to be easily hurt by each other.

Loretta goes to see Ronny at the bakery he owns and learns Ronny has a wooden prosthetic hand caused by absentmindedly putting his hand in a bread slicer while having a conversation with Johnny; Ronny&#x27;s fiancée subsequently left him. Loretta insists that they talk privately. They go to Ronny&#x27;s apartment, where Loretta cooks a meal, and both have several alcoholic beverages. Loretta compares Ronny to a wolf that would gnaw off its paw to escape a trap and claims he deliberately injured his hand to escape a bad relationship. Ronny reacts furiously and passionately, kissing Loretta; to her surprise, Loretta kisses him back. Ronny carries Loretta to his bed, where they make love.

That evening, Rose&#x27;s brother Raymond and his wife Rita join Rose, Cosmo, and Cosmo’s father for dinner and they wonder where Loretta is. Raymond recalls a particularly bright moon that he believes was in the sky when Cosmo was courting Rose, which Loretta and Ronny witness as well. The next morning, Loretta is overcome with guilt, but Ronny promises to never bother her again if she attends a performance of &quot;La bohème&quot; at the Met with him. Loretta goes to church to confess her infidelity and afterwards calls at Raymond and Rita&#x27;s store to close out the cash register. Upon leaving, she impulsively goes to a hair salon and buys a glamorous evening gown and shoes at a boutique.

Loretta is deeply moved by &quot;La bohème&quot;. While leaving the opera, she sees Cosmo, accompanied by his mistress, Mona, and confronts him. As Loretta is with Ronny, Cosmo suggests that Loretta keep their encounter a secret. Loretta attempts to return home, but Ronny desperately persuades her into another tryst. That same night, Rose dines alone at a restaurant and sees a college professor, Perry, being dramatically dumped by a female student.

Taking pity on Perry, Rose invites him to dine with her instead, allowing him to walk her home but refusing to invite him in because she is loyal to her marriage. Later, Johnny unexpectedly returns from Sicily after his mother&#x27;s &quot;miraculous&quot; recovery and meets with Rose at the Castorini house. They agree that men chase after women for fear of death.

Returning home next morning, Loretta is distressed to learn from Rose that Johnny will be there soon. Ronny arrives, and Rose invites him for breakfast over Loretta&#x27;s objections. Cosmo and Grandpa emerge from upstairs; Grandpa insists that Cosmo agree to pay for Loretta&#x27;s wedding. Rose then confronts Cosmo and demands that he end his affair; he is upset but gives in and, at Rose&#x27;s insistence, also agrees to go to confession. Both reaffirm their love for each other.

Raymond and Rita arrive, concerned that Loretta had not deposited the previous day&#x27;s takings at the bank, and are relieved to learn that she merely forgot and still has the money. When Johnny finally arrives, he breaks off the engagement, superstitiously believing that their marriage would cause his mother&#x27;s death. Loretta berates Johnny for breaking his promise and throws the engagement ring at him. Ronny borrows the ring and asks Loretta to marry him, to which she agrees. The family toasts the couple with champagne and Johnny joins in at Grandpa&#x27;s urging, since he will now be part of the family after all.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Moonstruck&quot; received critical acclaim upon release. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 89% based on reviews from 76 critics, with an average score of 7.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus read, &quot;Led by energetic performances from Nicolas Cage and Cher, &quot;Moonstruck&quot; is an exuberantly funny tribute to love and one of the decade&#x27;s most appealing comedies.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 83 out of 100 based on reviews from 18 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Time&quot; wrote, &quot;John Patrick Shanley&#x27;s witty, shapely script puts an octet of New Yorkers under a lunar-tuney spell one romantic night. Cher shines brightest of all.&quot; Roger Ebert, who later added the film among his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list, said: &quot;Reviews of the movie tend to make it sound like a madcap ethnic comedy, and that it is. But there is something more here, a certain bittersweet yearning that comes across as ineffably romantic, and a certain magical quality&quot;. Film historian Leonard Maltin gave the picture 4 out of 4 stars.

Gene Siskel, writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, recommended &quot;&quot;Moonstruck&quot;, which is being sold as a romance but actually is one of the funniest pictures to come out in quite some time. [...] You will not easily forget this incredibly robust family, created by writer John Patrick Shanley and directed by Norman Jewison, who makes a comeback with this uproarious film.&quot;

It appeared on both Siskel&#x27;s and Ebert&#x27;s Top 10 lists for 1987.

==Accolades==
In June 2008, AFI revealed its &quot;Ten top Ten&quot;—the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;Moonstruck&quot; was acknowledged as the eighth best film in the romantic comedy genre. The film is also number 72 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies,&quot; and number 41 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Laughs.
