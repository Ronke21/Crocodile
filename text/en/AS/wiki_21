<text>Besalú () is a town in the &quot;comarca&quot; of Garrotxa, in Girona, Catalonia, Spain.

The town&#x27;s importance was greater in the early Middle Ages, as capital of the county of Besalú, whose territory was roughly the same size as the current &quot;comarca&quot; of Garrotxa but sometime extended as far as Corbières, Aude, in France. Wilfred the Hairy, credited with the unification of Catalonia, was Count of Besalú. The town was also the birthplace of Raimon Vidal, a medieval troubadour.

Besalú was designated as a historical national property (&quot;conjunt històric-artístic&quot;) in 1966. The town&#x27;s most significant feature is its 12th-century Romanesque bridge over the Fluvià river, which features a gateway at its midpoint. The church of Sant Pere was consecrated in 1003. The town features arcaded streets and squares and also a restored mikveh, a ritual Jewish bath dating from the eleventh or twelfth century, as well as the remains of a medieval synagogue, located in the lower town near the river. Besalú also hosts the Museum of miniatures created by jeweler and art collector Lluís Carreras.

==History==

The name Besalú is derived from the Latin Bisuldunum, meaning a fort on a mountain between two rivers. It is also the historical capital of the county of “La Garrotxa”. One key date is the year 894, when Besalú was converted to a county with its own dynasty. The county changed from “L’Empordà” to “El Ripollès”. In the year 1111, Besalú lost its independence, for historical reasons in favor of the county of Barcelona. Centuries later, Besalú started a decadent period, worsened by the redemptions, wars with the French and carlists.

In 1966, Besalú was declared a site of historical and artistic importance.

==Monument==

The monument is circled by the ancient wall from the c. XII-XIV. Unfortunately only parts of the original walls still exist. The urban configuration of the site is almost identical to the original layout. Without a doubt, the Medieval bridge is the emblem of the town, of an angular design with seven uneven arcs and two towers. The part of the town nearest to the bridge there are many narrow streets that belong to the ancient Jewish quarter. It is in this area where you will find the &quot;Miqvé&quot;, the purification bath, which date from c. XII, and demonstrate the presence of an important Jewish community. It is the only Romanesque mikvah still remaining in Spain. The street from the medieval bridge leads to the Town Square “Plaça Major”, a square whose arcades date from c. XVI, and used to be the centre of the medieval town. 

Important buildings are the Local Government “Ajuntament” dating from c. XVII, the Royal Curia “Cúria Reial”, dating from c. XIV, and the &quot;Casa Tallaferro&quot;. The street “Tallaferro” leads to the entrance to the Castle precinct. Inside the precinct there remains one of the towers from the ancient County Castle, and the apse of Saint Mary “Santa Maria” that dates from c. XI. Along with the street “Portalet” these are the remains which best retain the medieval appearance, along with panoramic views of the Roman Bridge. 

Leading up from the main street “Carrer Major”, there are the “Casa Romà” (c. XIV) and the parish church of Saint Vincent “Sant Vicenç” dating from c. XI-XII which has very sculpturesque doors and windows. Near to the main Town Square, there is the “Prat de Sant Pere”, wide and spacious which used to be the Cemetery of the Benedictine monastery of Saint Peter “Sant Pere”. Today there only remains the three-nave church and one apse, dating from the c. XI. Also there is the small chapel of Saint James “Sant Jaume” (c. XII) and the “Casa Cornellà” (Llaudes) dating from c. XII and which has a patio with three galleries. Behind the monastery there is the church of the hospital of Saint Julian “Sant Julià”, with one nave and no apse, dating from c. XII, and an outstanding entrance portal.

<text>Hayesville is a town in Clay County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 311 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Clay County.

==History==
=== Quanassee ===
This was long an area of indigenous settlement along the Hiwassee River. An earthwork platform mound was built here, likely by people of the South Appalachian Mississippian culture about 1000 CE. It would have been the center of their village.

Later, the historic Cherokee developed a town known as &quot;Quanassee&quot; at this site. They built their townhouse on top of the mound, to provide a place for communal discussion and reaching consensus. It was one of the numerous &quot;Valley Towns&quot; located along the Hiwassee River in Western North Carolina. It was also along the Trading Path (also called the &quot;Unicoi Turnpike&quot;). That road led from Quanassee west to another town at present-day Murphy, North Carolina, then over the Unicoi Range at Unicoi Gap and down to the Cherokee town of Great Tellico (today Tellico Plains, Tennessee).

Quanassee had several hundred inhabitants by 1550. In 1716, South Carolina officials met with Cherokee leaders in Quanassee to obtain the Cherokee&#x27;s alliance in the Yamassee War. The next year South Carolina built a trading site in Quanassee to gain Cherokee commodities like deerskins in exchange for manufactured English goods. A Coosa (Creek) war party &quot;cut off&quot; Quanassee in 1725, demolishing the village and enslaving or killing most of its residents. The town was briefly reestablished before the American Revolution; Rutherford expedition forces camped there in 1776. In the 1820s, Baptist missionaries visited Quanassee to preach to families living there.

=== Fort Hembree ===
In October 1837, Tennessee militia established Fort Hembree near Hayesville to prepare for deporting the Cherokee. Approximately 1,000 Cherokee people were held prisoner at the fort and removed from the area. The military abandoned Fort Hembree in June 1838, though it was reactivated in 1860 to train soldiers for the Civil War.

After the Cherokee were forced to cede their land, European Americans settled in this rural area and took over what is now known as the Spikebuck Town Mound and Village Site. They cultivated much of the village site, disturbing the topsoil layers. Some excavations were conducted in the 1960s and 1970s. The town mound and village site was listed in 1982 on the National Register of Historic Places as an archeological site.

Clay County acquired the mound site in 2000 and protects it; the Archeological Conservancy acquired the town/village site and farmsteads in 2011.

=== Hayesville founded ===
The town was named Hayesville after 19th-century politician George Hayes. When running for representative from Cherokee County in the fall election of 1860, he learned that residents in the southeast end wanted to separate from Cherokee County and get their own county seat, because of the difficulty of traveling to the distant location. With the promise to introduce legislation to this effect, Hayes won a seat in the legislature. In February 1861 the legislation to organize a new county was introduced and passed by the North Carolina General Assembly. The county was named in honor of Kentucky statesman Henry Clay, and the county seat Hayesville, for Hayes. Though Hayesville was an active town since 1861 and town limits were set in 1882, it was not incorporated until March 12, 1913. The first mayor was S.E. Hogsed.

Hayesville High School was founded in 1870 as Hicksville Academy. In the 1890s it was bought by Duke University and offered college courses. After the first wood-frame county courthouse in Hayesville was destroyed by arson in 1870, the brick courthouse currently standing on the town square was constructed in 1888. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In mid-2007, courthouse operations moved to a new justice center built west of downtown.

Hayesville&#x27;s Methodist and Presbyterian churches were the earliest churches in Clay County; both congregations date to 1838. Their present buildings opened in 1943 and 1960 respectively. Truett Memorial, the town&#x27;s first Baptist church, dates to 1850; its extant stone building opened in 1949.

Hayesville’s post office opened May 7, 1868. The county&#x27;s first official bank opened in Hayesville on May 18, 1910. In October 1920 the railroad came to Hayesville. The Peavine line was completed to Andrews, North Carolina, where it connected with the Southern Railway. The line hauled mainly lumber and was dismantled in 1951.

Tiger’s Store downtown is thought to be the oldest continuously operating business in Clay County. It was established around 1899 in Shooting Creek and moved to Hayesville around 1908. Hotels began appearing in Hayesville in the 1920s. Clay County had a silent film theater in the 1920s. Later, the Hayesville Theater operated from the 1940s to the 1960s and live music was performed after film showings. Traveling music groups including Lester Flat and Earl Scruggs, Carl Story, Minnie Pearl, and Hank Williams performed at Hayesville High School in the 1940s and 50s. In 1945, Paul Westmoreland debuted his song “Detour (There&#x27;s a Muddy Road Ahead)&quot; in Hayesville. He wrote the song while on his way to Murphy. As of 2024, there are no movie theaters in Clay County.

On January 22, 1922, a midnight fire destroyed nearly all of downtown Hayesville, including several stores, the highway commission office and records, and the U.S. Post Office. The fire started at DeWease’s Hardware Store and was reportedly set intentionally to collect insurance money. The town’s current post office building was constructed in 1965.

===Late 20th century to present===
Clay County is featuring Cherokee heritage sites as part of its community redevelopment to emphasize its unique character. In addition to the Spikebuck Town Mound, it supports other Cherokee resources in Hayesville: the Quanassee Path, which highlights five Cherokee features on a walking path around Hayesville; the Cherokee Homestead Exhibit, with reconstructions of traditional summer and winter houses and a corn crib; and the Cherokee Botanical Sanctuary. In addition the CCCRA sponsors an annual Cherokee Heritage Festival.

Clay County&#x27;s public library started in a small room on the second floor of a building on Hayesville&#x27;s town square. At some point it moved to a small room in the county courthouse. In 1940 it became part of the Nantahala Regional Library system and hired its first librarian, Ellen Scroggs, in 1943. A new $80,000 library building opened on Sanderson St. downtown on June 25, 1967. It was named in honor of local-born Dr. Fred A. Moss, who contributed $10,000 towards its construction and donated books. Today Moss Memorial Library is the only public library in Clay County.

In the early 1940s Chatuge Dam was constructed near Hayesville by the Tennessee Valley Authority, creating Chatuge Lake. It was the tallest earthen dam in the world until the Aswan Dam was built in Egypt in 1964. In 2017, the dam was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Hayesville&#x27;s annual Festival on the Square began in 1980. The town&#x27;s annual Christmas parade began in 1987. Despite being a small town, in the 1980s Hayesville gained the only community theatre in far-west North Carolina. The Peacock Playhouse was constructed on Church Street by Lillith Lidseen. Born in Sweden in 1904, Lidseen moved with her parents to Chicago and studied fine arts at Wellesley College. After her brother Edwin established a pipe manufacturing business in Warne, she moved nearby. Nonprofit volunteer organization the Licklog Players (named after the local Licklog Creek) began performing shows at Hayesville High School&#x27;s auditorium in 1978 and Lidseen was asked to direct &quot;Brigadoon&quot;. Due to the community&#x27;s enthusiastic response, she decided that the area needed a professional theatre venue and built a three-story, 250-seat playhouse near downtown. Plans were drawn up in March 1981 and construction began in 1983. The first show performed at the theatre was &quot;The Curious Savage&quot; by the Licklog Players on June 6, 1986. Lidseen died in January 1987 before she was able to see a production in her theatre. The Lilith Lidseen Performing Arts Association was formed in 2007. It raised $800,000 to buy the building in 2009 and renovate it. After performing more than 100 plays at the venue, the Licklog Players moved to a strip mall and shut down after their 2014 season. Today the Peacock Performing Arts Center offers dozens of events per year, ranging from comedies to concerts.

In 2003 the US 64 bypass through Hayesville was expanded into a four-lane highway. NC 69 from Hayesville to Georgia was widened to four lanes in 2024. The Clay County Recreation Center was built in 2007 in Hayesville and it was expanded in 2013. In 2017, Reader&#x27;s Digest named Hayesville one of the top ten nicest places in America.

<doc id="127795" wikidata="Q2012320" url="?curid=127795" title="Boiling Springs, North Carolina">
<text>Boiling Springs is a town in Cleveland County, North Carolina, United States and is located in the westernmost part of the Charlotte metropolitan area, located approximately 50 miles away from the city. As of the 2010 census, the town&#x27;s population was 4,647. It is home to Gardner–Webb University. The town is named after the natural spring found on the university&#x27;s property, which feeds a small lake.

==History ==

People began settling the area around the namesake boiling springs in 1843. The first families to settle were the Hamricks, the Greenes and the McSwains. It was only appropriate that the settlement be named Boiling Springs. One of the first buildings was Boiling Springs Baptist Church, built in 1847 about 100 yards from the springs. Boiling Springs was known as a sleepy community, with no railroads, no industries, few stores and no paved streets. At the turn of the 20th century, Kings Mountain Baptist and Sandy Run Associations began looking for a place to build their denominational high school and chose Boiling Springs because it was geographically situated between the two associations and because the Boiling Springs community made concerted efforts to attract the school. The Boiling Springs High School boarding institution opened for business in 1905. School authorities felt that neither intoxicating drinks nor cigarettes should be sold near the school, so in 1911 the town was incorporated in order to ban the sale of such items. Town limits were decided by drawing a mile and a half radius from the school&#x27;s original bell tower.

Incorporation of the town proved to be a major step forward because it provided a government that could function and enable the town not only to grow but to furnish water, police and fire protection, paved streets and garbage collection for the town and the school. As time progressed the growth of the town was largely tied to the growth of the Boiling Springs High School which became the Boiling Springs Junior College in 1928, Gardner Webb Junior College in 1942, and finally after achieving status as a senior college and developing several graduate programs, Gardner–Webb University in 1993.

Voters approved ordinances to allow for the sale of beer, unfortified wine, and malt beverages within town limits in 2018.

E. B. Hamrick Hall and the Irvin-Hamrick Log House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Grover is a town in Cleveland County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 708 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Grover is classified as a small town where railway and highway routes Interstate 85 and U.S. Route 29 cross the state line between North Carolina and South Carolina. It was previously named Whitaker and legally was in South Carolina. The name change to Grover in 1885 was in honor of President Grover Cleveland. Gingerbread Row, (Cleveland Avenue - NC Highway 226) has an antique look with many restored homes in beautiful colors.

A railroad-dominated town started when the Atlanta Charlotte Airline Railway placed a turntable for engines to be spun. They operated from the 1880s to the 1920s and Southern Railway (U.S.) continues to carry passengers to this day (now known as Norfolk Southern). Mail drops and pickups by train occurred several times per day in Grover often with the mail bag put on a hook while the train came through at speed. Amtrak also operates on the line (under permission) and carries passengers from Atlanta to Charlotte, Richmond, Boston, and New York City. George W. Bush made a rail stop in Grover during his U.S. Presidential campaign.

Grover is also home to international companies like Eaton, Commercial Vehicle Group, Southern Power, 84 Lumber, Uniquetex, and the US Presidential Culinary Museum and Library. Hatcher Hughes previously lived in Grover and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1924 for his Broadway play, &quot;Hell-Bent Fer Heaven&quot;, a show about his own people from the area of the foothills - where Grover is located. He was a professor at the Ivy League college Columbia University. The Hambright (Hambrecht) family of Philadelphia and Prussia lives in Grover and built the tallest and largest mansion there in 1879 under the guidance of Doctor Alfred Frederick Hambright (Hambrecht). Grover also hosts a former White House Chef and manager of the Presidential resort and conference center Camp David, Martin CJ Mongiello, who lives there.

Grover is a part of Cleveland County, North Carolina. The county is named after Colonel Benjamin Cleveland (Cleaveland - Thorkil de Cleveland of Cleveland County York, England in the year 1066) - of the King&#x27;s Mountain battle - a companion of Colonel Frederick Hambright (with his son John by his side) during the Revolutionary War. Grover holds as many North Carolina Official Historical Markers as the county seat of Shelby. It was the town of entry by The Marquess, Lord Charles Cornwallis when he invaded North Carolina with his cavalry, artillery, and army. The butcher of New Jersey, Major Patrick Ferguson, also camped near parts of present-day Grover, prior to battle on King&#x27;s Mountain, a local mountain range named after the King Family that lived there. In 1887, the legislature voted to change the name of Grover&#x27;s County - to the more utilized English word version of, &quot;Cleveland&quot;, from its previous version of Cleaveland. President Grover Cleveland had been in office since 1885 (the first Democrat elected after the American Civil War).


This portion of history affected local matters. A German bachelor, Grover Cleveland, was ill at ease at first with all the comforts of the White House. &quot;I must go to dinner,&quot; he wrote to a friend, &quot;but I wish it was to eat a pickled herring, a Swiss cheese, and a chop at Louis&#x27; instead of the French stuff I shall find.&quot; He gained advance publicity and coverage as did the town of Grover. A portion of the original plan encompassed renaming the town after the President&#x27;s first name to attain notice. In June 1886, this predicament would be fixed for Grover. President Cleveland married 21-year-old Frances Folsom; he was the only President ever married in the White House. This historic event and the ensuing honeymoon took on news attention. The name change of Grover&#x27;s county took on epic proportions shortly after this event. The town, White House and county historically affected each other in an unpredicted manner. In 1887, Cleaveland County held a referendum and vote to change its name to the more popular spelling of, &quot;Cleveland&quot;. The latest, mistaken report of this (verified July 2008) with a letter delivered by the US Postal Service, from the White House Historical Society to The Inn of the Patriots, 301 Cleveland Avenue, Grover Cleveland, NC 28073. No such town exists in America.

Cleveland Avenue (Route 226) runs through Grover - parallel to Main Street. Many Hambright&#x27;s (Hambrecht&#x27;s), Hamrick&#x27;s and Herndon&#x27;s lived on Cleveland Avenue. Today, the Shiloh Presbyterian Church (built in 1905) remains next to Doctor Alfred Hambright&#x27;s (Hambrecht) home that was built after the Civil War. A statue was dedicated to Colonel Frederick Hambright (Hambrecht Prussian family) and US Marine Corporal, Clyde Furman Horton on July 1, 2008. The Shiloh Presbyterian Church Cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

Many other prominent names dominate the makeup of Grover and are listed repeatedly in reference level books of the Cleveland County Library System, families like Herndon, Hambright (Hambrecht), Hamrick, Rountree, Keeter, Graham, Cleaveland, Cleveland, Scruggs, and Goforth. Within the history of Grover - it is often confused with President Grover Cleveland versus Benjamin Cleveland and where the names came from. Although, each Cleveland are related - going back to Amos Cleveland, of Massachusetts and Cleveland, Ohio.

Grover is in the process of restoring itself to a town with a &#x27;turn-of-the-century look and feel&#x27;. Its train and spinning engine turntable with history applied for such in a 2010 North Carolina Main Street program. The current mayor is Bill Willis. The town historian for a long period was Doctor Cobia Goforth who died in late 2017.

<text>Patterson Springs is a town in Cleveland County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 622 at the 2010 census.

==History==

Patterson Springs was originally a small farming community called &quot;Swangs&quot;, with only a train depot and a post office. William George Patterson bought the land that held three springs from the &quot;Epps&quot; family. Patterson hoped that the supposed healing powers of these springs would help heal his son, Billy, who had poor health. Eventually, news of the supposed healing powers of these springs spread, and Patterson created a thirty to forty room resort to house travelers and merchants. The resort, which was one of several in the area, mainly attracted people from North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. When the attendees of the resort were not at the springs, Patterson offered lawn bowling and a dance every Saturday night. In 1885, the name &quot;Swangs confused the railroad people so they convinced the post office to change it to Patterson Springs and the government officials agreed. In 1915, a school building was created, housing all eleven(not 12) grades. Another was built in 1923, which housed grades one through eight, while the High School students attended No. 3 High School. In the 1960s, the post office closed, then in the 1970s, both schools closed. The train depot no longer exists. Most students now attend Township No. 3 Elementary School, Crest High School, or Pinnacle Classical Academy.

<text>Empúries ( ) was an ancient Greek city on the Mediterranean coast of Catalonia, Spain. The city Ἐμπόριον (, Emporion, meaning &quot;trading place&quot;, &quot;cf.&quot; emporion) was founded in 575 BC by Greeks from Phocaea. After the invasion of Gaul from Iberia by Hannibal the Carthaginian general in 218 BC, the city was occupied by the Romans (Latin: ). In the Early Middle Ages, the city&#x27;s exposed coastal position left it open to marauders and it was abandoned.

Empúries is located within the Catalan comarca of Alt Empordà on the Costa Brava. The ruins are midway between the town of L&#x27;Escala and the tiny village of Sant Martí d&#x27;Empúries.

== History ==

Empúries was founded on a small island at the mouth of the river Fluvià, in a region inhabited by the Indigetes (at the present time, the mouth of the Fluvià is about 6 km to the north). This city came to be known as the &quot;Palaiapolis&quot;, the &quot;old city&quot; when, towards 550 BC, the inhabitants moved to the mainland, creating the &quot;Neapolis&quot;, the &quot;new city&quot;.

After the conquest of Phocaea by the Persian king Cyrus II in 530 BC, the new city&#x27;s population increased considerably through the influx of refugees. In the face of strong pressure from Carthage, the city managed to retain its independent Greek character. Political and commercial agreements were concluded with the indigenous population long settled in the nearby city of Indika. Situated as it was on the coastal commercial route between Greek Massalia (Marseille) and Tartessos in the far south of Hispania, the city developed into a large economic and commercial centre as well as being the largest Greek colony in the Iberian Peninsula.

During the Punic Wars, Empúries allied itself with Rome, and Publius Cornelius Scipio initiated the conquest of Hispania from this city in 218 BC by sending his brother Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus there with Roman troops.

After the conquest of Hispania by the Romans, Empúries remained an independent city-state. However, in the civil war between Pompey and Julius Caesar, it opted for Pompey, and after his defeat it was stripped of its autonomy. A &quot;colonia&quot; of Roman veterans, named Emporiae, was established near Indika to control the region.

From that time onwards, Empúries began to decline, obscured by the power of Tarraco (Tarragona) and Barcino (Barcelona). At the end of the 3rd century it became one of the first cities in Spain to admit Christian evangelists. In that century, too, the Greek town was abandoned while the Roman town survived as a mint and the largely ceremonial seat of a coastal county, Castelló d&#x27;Empúries, until the Viking raids of the mid-9th century. Coinage began again under count Hugh II of Empúries (1078–1117).

==Archaeological remains==
Although the precise location of the town was known since the 15th century, it was only in the 20th century that systematic excavations were carried out. The site is known as Ampurias. The first official excavations started in 1908 and were held by the Junta de Museus de Barcelona and directed by Emili Gandia i Ortega under the instructions of Josep Puig i Cadafalch and Pere Bosch-Gimpera. These excavations are still going on.

===&quot;Palaiapolis&quot;===
The island on which the &quot;Palaiopolis&quot; was situated is now part of the mainland and is the site of the mediaeval village of Sant Martí d&#x27;Empúries. The former harbour has silted up as well. Hardly any excavation has been done here.

After the founding of the &quot;Neapolis&quot;, the old city seems to have functioned as an acropolis (fortress and temple). Strabo mentions a temple dedicated to Artemis at this site.

===&quot;Neapolis&quot;===

The Neapolis consisted of a walled precinct with an irregular ground plan of 200 by 130 m. The walls were built, and repeatedly modified in the period from the 5th to the 2nd century BC. To the west the wall separated the &quot;Neapolis&quot; from the Iberian town of Indika.

In the south-west part of the city were various temples, replacing an older one to Artemis, such as a temple to Asclepius, of whom a marble statue was found. In the south-east part was a temple to Zeus-Serapis. The majority of the excavated buildings belong to the Hellenistic period. In addition to houses, some of which are decorated with mosaics and wallpaintings, a number of public buildings have come to light, such as those in the agora and the harbour mole. In the Roman period, thermae and a palaeochristian basilica were built.

To the south and east of the new city was an area that served as a necropolis.

===Roman city===
Only about 20% of the Roman city (municipium) has been excavated. The city has the typical orthogonal layout of Roman military camps, with two principal roads meeting at the forum. The Roman city is considerably larger than the Greek one. During the Republican period a temple was built dedicated to the Capitoline Triad: Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva. During the reign of the emperor Augustus a basilica and curia were added.

In the eastern part of the town a number of large houses have been excavated, with an inner courtyard, numerous annexes, floor mosaics, and paintings. In the 2nd century the town was surrounded by a wall without towers. An amphitheatre and palaestra were built outside the wall.

== Necropolis ==
The necropolis of Empúries remained in use for a very long period, from the 7th century BC up to the Middle Ages, but many tombs were looted. Martín Almagro Basch wrote two books collecting all data on the majority of cemeteries in the area. There are four types: early Greek and Iberian, late Republican, early Roman Empire and late Roman Empire.

===Early Greeks and Iberians (6th–3rd century BC)===

Burials were located in the southern and western sides of &quot;Neapolis&quot;. The western sector was occupied by the so-called &quot;necropolis of the wall northeast&quot;. Inhumation (Greeks) predominated while a third of burials were cremations (Iberians).

=== Late Republican (2nd–1st century BC) ===
The ancient necropolis remained in use with inhumations and cremations, possibly Greek and indigenous from the &quot;Neapolis&quot;. Cremations predominated in another group, possibly of Roman origin, whose cemetery is located on the north side of the neighboring hill of Les Corts, located southwest of the city. This necropolis was in use particularly during the 2nd and 1st centuries BC. Archaeologists found small mounds built with square blocks of stone with the remains of cremation in the middle.

=== Early Roman Empire (1st century BC – 2nd century AD) ===
No burials have been found clearly from the second quarter of the 1st century BC until the reign of Augustus (about 35 years). Cremation burials then predominated until the reign of Emperor Flavian (at the end of the 1st century AD) around a hillside where the Roman city is located.

Burial rituals changed in the 2nd century AD, with only inhumations found.

=== Late Roman empire (3rd – 6th century) ===
Precise chronologies are hampered by the lack of grave goods in tombs. The whole area of the ancient Greek city was filled with inhumation burials, perhaps related to the worship of the early Christian basilica or Cella Memoria, situated there. Burials are also in many of the ancient necropolis of earlier times (as Bonjoan, in use for a thousand years) and in new ones. It is possible they were related to the Roman villae located near them. There is a monument of El Castellet and nearby tombs.

== The Archaeology Museum of Catalonia ==
The branch of the Archaeology Museum of Catalonia in Empúries (MAC-Empúries) offers visitors an experience in direct contact with the archaeological remains there. A visit to the Greek city and the Roman city are complemented by a tour through the museum, which showcases representative objects from the history of the site that have been uncovered in the years of excavations in Empúries. The museum has parking facilities and the site may be reached by a traffic-free coastal walk from L&#x27;Escala.

<doc id="127810" wikidata="Q670974" url="?curid=127810" title="Bollandist">
<text>The Bollandist Society (; ) is an association of scholars, philologists, and historians (originally all Jesuits, but now including non-Jesuits) who since the early seventeenth century have studied hagiography and the cult of the saints in Christianity. Their most important publication has been the &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot; (The Acts of the Saints). They are named after the Flemish Jesuit Jean Bollandus (1596–1665).

==&quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot;==

The idea of the &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot; was first conceived by the Dutch Jesuit Heribert Rosweyde (1569–1629), who was a lecturer at the Jesuit college of Douai. Rosweyde used his leisure time to collect information about the lives of the saints. His principal work, the 1615 &quot;Vitae Patrum&quot;, became the foundation of the &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot;. Rosweyde contracted a contagious disease while ministering to a dying man, and died himself on October 5, 1629, at the age of sixty.

Father Jean Bollandus was prefect of studies in the Jesuit college of Mechelen. Upon the death of Rosweyde, Bollandus was asked to review Rosweyde&#x27;s papers. Bollandus then continued the work from Antwerp.

The task was to search out and classify materials, to print what seemed to be the most reliable sources of information concerning the saints venerated by the Church and to illustrate points of difficulty. Underestimating the magnitude of the undertaking, Bollandus initially thought he could finish the work on his own, but after a few years he had to admit that the undertaking was beyond his individual strength. He was then assigned an assistant, Godfrey Henschenius (1601–81). The first two volumes of the &quot;Acta&quot;, by Bollandus and Henschenius, were published in Antwerp in 1643.

Unlike Rosweyde and Bollandus, Henschenius was allowed to devote himself exclusively to the writing of the &quot;Acta&quot;. He solved many problems relating to chronology, geography and the philological interpretation of the sources. February, March, and April (that is, the collected hagiographies of saints whose feast days occur in each month) took up three volumes each, May covered eight, and June seven volumes. By the time of his death, 24 volumes had appeared; moreover, Henschenius left many notes and commentaries for the following volumes. It can therefore be said that the &quot;Acta&quot; owe their final form to Henschenius.

In 1659, Bollandus and Henschenius were joined by Daniel Papebrochius (1628–1714), who devoted fifty-five years of his life to the &quot;Acta&quot;. From July 1660 until December 1662, Henschenius and Papebrochius travelled through Germany, Italy and France in order to collect copies of hagiographic manuscripts. Another Bollandist of this period was Jean Gamans.

===Carmelite controversy===
With publication in 1675 of the first volume of April, the Bollandists became embroiled in a lengthy controversy with the Carmelites. In writing of St. Albert, Patriarch of Jerusalem and author of the Carmelite rule, Papebrochius had stated in his preliminary commentary that the tradition universally received by the Carmelites that the origin of the order dated back to the prophet Elijah, who was regarded as its founder, was insufficiently grounded. But learning that the attacks could jeopardize the work of the group, he and his companions decided that the time for silence had passed. From 1681 to 1698 a series of letters, pamphlets and other documents was issued by each side. The Carmelites were supported by a Spanish tribunal, while the Bollandists had the support of Jean de Launoy and the Sorbonne. In November 1698, Pope Innocent XII ordered an end to the controversy.

By the time of the death of Father Papebrochius in 1714, the first six months of the year were practically completed. Work continued in the following years, led by Conrad Janninck among others.

==Suppression and relocation (18th century)==
By the time the Society of Jesus was suppressed by Pope Clement XIV in 1773, the Bollandists had produced 50 volumes in 130 years. They had also moved from Antwerp to Brussels, where they continued their work in the monastery of the Coudenberg until 1788, when the Bollandist Society was suppressed by the Austrian government of the Low Countries. Their library was acquired by the Premonstratensians of Tongerlo Abbey, who endeavored to carry on the work. The fifty-third volume was published by the abbot of Tongerloo in 1794. The 53 volumes of the first series covered the saints from January 1 to October 14. Four former Bollandists supervised the work.

==Refoundation==
After the re-establishment of the Society of Jesus in Belgium, a new Society of Bollandists was formed in the second quarter of the nineteenth century under the patronage of the Belgian government. The first volume of the new series appeared in 1845. A collection of 61 volumes was published in Paris between 1863 and 1867. By the end of the 19th century the work was re-oriented, bringing it more in line with the new philological methods. In 1882, a quarterly review on critical hagiography was established under the title of &quot;Analecta Bollandiana&quot;, which still exists today and publishes supplements to the &quot;Acta&quot;.

The Bollandists&#x27; studies led to the texts of the &quot;Missale Romanum&quot;, the &quot;Liturgia Horarum&quot; and the &quot;Martyrologium&quot; referring to Mary of Magdala. These studies were positively cited in Pope Francis&#x27; elevation of the saint&#x27;s feast day to the status of a liturgical Feast.

The Bollandist Society is the only institution dedicated exclusively to the critical study of hagiography. &quot;There is a lot of ‘fake news’&quot; about saints, said Bollandist Marc Lindeijer, S.J. &quot;We can spend a lifetime correcting Wikipedia.&quot; Nonetheless, legends of the saints provide important information for historians and linguistic scholars. Patrick J. Geary says that the tales serve as &quot;a window into the world of people of that time and place&quot;.

==In fiction==
The Bollandist Society has an important role in &quot;The Deptford Trilogy&quot; by Canadian novelist Robertson Davies. The series&#x27; protagonist, though not a Catholic, takes a deep interest in saints and their lives, and his scholarly efforts are welcomed by the Bollandists.

<text>Shelby is a city in and the county seat of Cleveland County, North Carolina. It lies near the western edge of the Charlotte-Concord, NC-SC Combined Statistical Area. The population was 21,918 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area was originally inhabited by Catawba and Cherokee peoples and was later settled around 1760. The city was chartered in 1843 and named after Colonel Isaac Shelby, a hero of the battle of Kings Mountain (1780) during the American Revolution. Shelby was agricultural until the railways in the 1870s stimulated Shelby&#x27;s development. 

In 1916, Thomas Dixon, Jr., the author of &quot;The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan&quot;, planned to erect a statue of his uncle Leroy McAfee on the courthouse square. The project was initially met with enthusiasm, until it was announced that Dixon wanted the statue to be wearing a Ku Klux Klan mask. A Confederate monument is located on the west side of the courthouse square, while foreign war monuments stand on the north and south sides.

Nevertheless, the Ku Klux Klan did have a significant presence in Shelby in the 1870s and its crimes were the subject of depositions and affidavits collected by Captain Albion Howe (1841–1873) of the 4th Regiment Artillery.
Textiles later became its chief industry during the 1920s, when production of cotton in Cleveland County rose from 8,000 to 80,000 bales a year. Cotton production peaked in 1948 with Cleveland County producing 83,549 bales, making it North Carolina&#x27;s premier cotton county. In the 1930s, Shelby was known as &quot;The Leading Shopping Center between Charlotte and Asheville&quot;. People from surrounding counties came to Shelby to shop, since there were numerous types of local and chain stores. By 1947, Shelby was a true thriving town with the mills paying among the highest wages in the South. In the 1950s, droughts, insect infestations, and government acreage controls resulted in the decline of cotton as Cleveland County&#x27;s primary crop.

Shelby was home to a group of political leaders in the first half of the 20th century, that have become known as the &quot;Shelby Dynasty.&quot; These political leaders wielded power through the local, State and Federal governments. The most notable of Shelby&#x27;s political leadership were brothers James L. Webb and Edwin Yates Webb and brothers-in-law O. Max Gardner and Clyde R. Hoey. As governors, NC representatives, and US congressman, the group impacted Shelby life and Shelby&#x27;s reputation throughout the state.

The architecture of Shelby is noteworthy in that despite being in a rural area, there are magnificent homes and buildings with unique character. Some buildings are county landmarks, such as the Historic Campbell Building and others are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Banker&#x27;s House, Joshua Beam House, Central Shelby Historic District, Cleveland County Courthouse, East Marion-Belvedere Park Historic District, James Heyward Hull House, Masonic Temple Building, Dr. Victor McBrayer House, George Sperling House and Outbuildings, Joseph Suttle House, Webbley, and West Warren Street Historic District.

==Community==
Shelby&#x27;s community of art, music, and government all take place in Uptown Shelby historic district. Uptown Shelby is home to a large square, local businesses, and a variety of restaurants surrounding The Courthouse Square. Re-branded as &quot;uptown&quot; in the 70s to bring town-people back off the highway and away from the mall, this area has been named a &quot;Main Street&quot; by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

The local pavilion hosts a twice-a-week Farmers Market on Wednesdays and Saturdays, as well as local concerts. Monthly summer festivals like Shelby Alive and Seventh Inning Stretch, hosted by the American Legion World Series, brings regional music acts to perform in the city. With a low cost of living and a vibrant small town environment, Uptown Shelby has experienced a 10% growth in street level occupancy from 78% to 88%. Uptown Shelby hosts opportunities for active living with groups that engage in cycling, running, crossfit, and yoga. Multiple restaurants and other local businesses are attracting day trippers and shoppers from across the region. Part of the city brand, live music is a part of community with the Earl Scruggs Center and the Don Gibson Theatre.

Other public attractions include walking trails like the thread trail and the Broad River Trail as well as public events. Reoccurring events include the Fall Livermush festival, The Cleveland County fair which is the largest county agricultural fair in North Carolina, The 7thinning Stretch, The Art of Sound, Arts on the Square, and various fundraisers.

Shelby is known throughout the state for its collaborative methods between private, non-profit, and public sector organizations with groups like Leadership Cleveland County.

In 2011, Shelby was named the permanent home of the American Legion Baseball World Series after decades of rotating venues for the event.

Upon completion of the project, Charlotte and Asheville will be connected by virtually uninterrupted freeway via Interstate 85, US Highway 74, and Interstate 26.

Shelby is also served by four North Carolina State Highways.
*North Carolina Highway 18

==Education==
Cleveland County Schools is the school district for all of Cleveland County, including Shelby.

Prior to January 2004, the city was in Shelby City Schools, a separate school district.

Secondary and intermediate schools include:
* Shelby High School

Elementary schools include:
* Elizabeth Elementary School
* Jefferson Elementary School
* James Love Elementary School
Springmore, Township Three, and Union elementary schools have Shelby postal addresses but are outside of the Shelby corporate limits.

Graham and Marion elementary schools closed in 2022, and the former Shelby Intermediate School was to be converted into an elementary school including the former Graham and Marion zones; in other words, it became Elizabeth Elementary School. The building had been Elizabeth Elementary prior to being converted into an intermediate school. The conversion returned it to its former name.

==In popular culture==
The 2004 film adaptation of &quot;Blood Done Sign My Name&quot; was filmed in Shelby – as well as the reaping scene in the 2012 film adaptation of &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;, and the 1982 slasher film &quot;Death Screams&quot;.

A fictionalized version of the city is the setting of HBO comedy show &quot;Eastbound &amp; Down&quot;. Filmed in Wilmington, North Carolina, it bears little geographic or cultural resemblance to the real place. Actor and writer Danny McBride chose the location as an inspiration because of its size, attitude, and name.

The TV show &quot;Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern&quot; visited the 2009 Livermush festival in Shelby.

On November 11, 2007, the Oxygen Network&#x27;s &quot;Captured&quot; aired a profile of The Brenda Sue Brown murder mystery that took place in Shelby in 1966.

<text>Bolton is a town in Columbus County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 519 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Bolton was established in 1899 and named for the Bolton Lumber Company. It became an incorporated community in 1915.

In 1981 undercover agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation were investigating corruption in Columbus County as part of the Colcor investigation. As part of their inquiry into election fraud, the agents pretended to be interest in opening a bar in Bolton. They pushed for a referendum to legalize liquor-by-the-drink in the town and paid local politician Herbert Riggins to buy votes in their favor, the first time the FBI had ever attempted to manipulate a public election. The referendum was held on April 30, 1982, with a majority of local residents in favor of legalizing liquor-by-the-drink, though Riggins mostly avoided involving himself in the vote. The North Carolina State Board of Elections later nullified the referendum.

The Colcor affair was followed by a series of other scandals which embroiled the town, beginning with the shooting of the town&#x27;s first black mayor in 1990 by a white State Highway Patrolman. Civil rights groups responded by launching the &quot;Bolton Movement&quot;, a series of protests across the county, which led to the Ku Klux Klan hosting counterprotests in the town. A few years later the mayor and an alderman pled no contest to charges of mismanaging the town&#x27;s finances. In 2002 the Bolton police chief was placed on administrative leave after allegedly attacking a couple in the town hall who were complaining about police brutality.

Before the two events, the population was 951 at the 2010 census but is believed to be lower following the two disasters, some estimates going as low as 450 people. The shrinking of town&#x27;s size, and damage from the storms has led to a rapid decline in tax base.

==History==
Fair Bluff was the name originally given to a bluff overlooking the Lumber River. In 1807 plans were made to build a town upon the lands of John Wooton at the bluff to be known as Wootonton. The town was established but the name was never changed. The community was reincorporated in 1873.

The Powell House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

Agriculture has always been a mainstay of the economy in the town. Tobacco was a major commodity grown in the area. By the eighties, tobacco growing subsided. This caused a shift for the town and its citizens. The downtown continued to thrive until the late 1980s when a car dealership moved from the business district to another location. Haphazard town planning saw a mixture of residential, business, and industry all over town. Tens of millions in US government grants poured into the city beginning in the mid-1980s until present day. But the town continued to decline and people left for better opportunities elsewhere. The decline in Fair Bluff was similar to neighboring towns of Tabor City, Boardman, Brunswick, Cerro Gordo, and Chadbourn. A town manager was hired to handle administrative duties of the town,

In 1999, Fair Bluff experienced a devastating flood event.
In 2012, the Police Chief of Fair Bluff Marty Lewis was arrested, tried and convicted for selling and delivering oxycodone and possession with the intent to sell and conspiracy to traffic while acting as police chief. He was sentenced to a minimum of seven years in prison and fined $100,000. On April 9, 2015, Marty Lewis filled an appeal of his case. On November 3, 2015, the verdict was unanimously affirmed by the North Carolina Court of Appeals, leaving in place the 90 to 117-month prison sentence originally imposed. Lewis will not be eligible for parole before November 2022.

In 2016, the town was devastated by flooding on the Lumber River caused by Hurricane Matthew, prompting the evacuation of hundreds of residents. Floodwaters reached the town hall, police department, fire department, a grocery store, and a school. As of June 2018, the rebuilding effort was still underway but several hundred residents who had fled rising floodwaters never returned and a number of businesses remained shuttered.

In September 2018 Fair Bluff was flooded again by the impact of Hurricane Florence, again forcing evacuations and leaving the downtown area under water again, and destroying 72 homes. After Florence, many buildings in the downtown area of the town lay abandoned, with no plans to reoccupy or fix them. The town&#x27;s only factory closed several months later, and hundreds of residents moved away. The federal government bought out some residents&#x27; properties, straining the municipal government&#x27;s tax base. The town government drew up plans to level the historic business district and turn it into a park, and build a new business district further away from the river.

==Government==

Fair Bluff has a part-time town manager, assisted by the elected town mayor and town council. The town manager also works for five other deteriorating towns in Columbus County.

Fair Bluff is in the 13th District for the North Carolina Senate, represented by Michael Walters as of September 2014, and in the 46th district for the North Carolina House of Representatives, where, as of September 2021, they are represented by Tabor City native and used car dealer Brenden Jones.

<text>Lake Waccamaw is a town in Columbus County, North Carolina, United States. The 2010 census population was 1,480. Originally home to Native Americans, Europeans later colonized Lake Waccamaw in the 18th century. The Europeans built naval stores and the discovery of turpentine oil led to the Wilmington-Manchester railroad track being created. A shingle company was later converted to a lumber company. In 1910, a group of townspeople created the Waccamaw Club.

The town surrounds Lake Waccamaw, which features 9,000 acres of diverse wildlife and is a major source of revenue for the town. The lake is bustling with many endemic species of fish, birds, mollusks, and other animals. In 2018, a forty-year ban on hunting alligators was lifted. The town of Lake Waccamaw provides many recreational activities, such as birdwatching and hiking, due to the large population of wildlife and mild terrain.

==History==
The town of Lake Waccamaw was first inhabited by Native Americans before the Europeans came and colonized the area. Charles the Second of England granted proprietors individual grants to allow them to sail to the new world to bring him back riches and news. By the mid-eighteenth century, Lake Waccamaw had a good number of settlers. People like John Powell, from Virginia, brought cattle. John Powell&#x27;s son Absalom Powell started to buy land near Lake Waccamaw. John Powell&#x27;s other son Issac Powell was made the first major of the Brandon, County Durham militia in 1804 and justice of peace in 1806. Issac owned most of Lake Waccamaw.

Lake Waccamaw and nearby city Flemington grew slowly with the help of the Wilmington-Manchester railroad being built. The railroad brought the rural town access to the world. The addition of the railroad also made the settlement grow when the actual freshwater lake was then discovered. However, this growth increased rapidly when the naval stores and turpentine business began to grow.

On January 26, 1869, Charles Oscar Beers started his shingle industry along the southern shore of Lake Waccamaw. Another company also started south of the lake by Henry Bascom Short after Beers started his company. These two companies came together and formed a new company named Short and Beers, which brought more business to the town and created more jobs. Over time, the company went from producing shingles to becoming the North Carolina Lumber Company.

Around 1910, a local group formed the Waccamaw Club. The club served as a gathering place for hunting parties and house parties. The club later disbanded, and the building then became the Waccamaw Hotel. The Lake Waccamaw Depot was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

The Waccamaw Dam was built in 1926 by the state to prevent the lake from shrinking in dry weather. In 2018, a new bridge that goes over the Waccamaw Dam was finally finished and open for locals.

== Ecology ==
Lake Waccamaw, North Carolina is home Lake Waccamaw, a state park and wildlife refuge. The majority of Lake Waccamaw&#x27;s revenue comes from tourism and tours around the park, as well as research projects conducted on the Lake&#x27;s endemic species. A wide range of animal species resides in the town of Lake Waccamaw, due to the town being right next to the lake. For having a high pH and alkalinity, Lake Waccamaw is one of the few lakes that can harbor endemic species, which are species only native to one graphic region.

Red-Cockaded Woodpeckers, Swallow-Tailed Kites, and Black Bears are animal species that take refuge on land in Lake Waccamaw State Park. The Red-Cockaded Woodpeckers population has shrunk a measurable amount due to timber harvesting and the maturing of the pine forest that neighbor the lake. The Swallow-Tailed Kite population is the most dense in the town of Lake Waccamaw than in the entire state of North Carolina. Black bears roam the town area and the forest of Lake Waccamaw. The forest are a perfect environment for them because of the opportunity for den sites, food, and coverage from the weather. Brown-headed nuthatches, parula warblers, and white-eyed vireos are also other bird species that inhabit the town and its surroundings.

Aquatic life is very diverse in Lake Waccamaw. There are many fish species the Waccamaw Darter, the Waccamaw Killfish, and the Waccamaw Silverside. Alligators are part of the ecosystem of Lake Waccamaw. There was an uplift on a ban on alligator hunting in March 2018. The ban was removed after being enforced for over 40 years. The reason for the ban was that the alligators were getting over hunted, but now the population is back to normal. Bullfrogs, leopard frogs, and cricket frogs roam the damp environments around Lake Waccamaw. The Waccamaw fatmucket and Waccamaw Spike, which are mollusks, is a prominent in the filtration of the water in the lake. The Venus-hair fern, green-fly orchid, seven-angled pipewort, Narrowleaf yellow pond lily, and water arrowhead are native plants of town Lake Waccamaw. These are considered rare. In 2012, residents reported, and researchers at N.C. State University confirmed, that the invasive aquatic weed hydrilla had infested of Lake Waccamaw. There are two known endemic snail species, the Waccamaw amnicola and the Waccamaw Siltsnail.

The terrain of the town is also very diverse with forested wetlands, tidal marshes, and longleaf pine forests. The tidal marshes filter pollution of the water and in the 18th and 19th, was used for rice farming. The longleaf pine forest are home to the birds, bears, deer, and other animals the reside in the area of Lake Waccamaw. Prescribed burning is used to keep the growth of the forest under control. Forested wetlands are critical in reducing the risk of flooding and shelter for all organisms. They provide opportunities for feeding on these organisms when the water rises.

== Lake Waccamaw ==
 Lake Waccamaw is home to North Carolina&#x27;s largest natural freshwater lake, and the largest of the North Carolina Bay Lakes at 8,938 acres. Lake Waccamaw is called a Bay Lake not because it is a body of water, but because of the abundance of Sweet Bay, and Red Bay trees growing beside the shore. The lake is roughly 5.2 miles by 3.5 miles in length and is estimated to be between 10,000 and 15,000 years old. Numerous other bodies of water feed into Lake Waccamaw including the Waccamaw River, and four smaller creeks, the largest of which is called Big Creek. Lake Waccamaw also has an unusually high PH level is due to an abundance of calcareous formations that underline the bottom of the lake, and have dissolved into Lake Waccamaw over time. These formations have caused steep bluffs on the north shore of the lake where the calcareous mixture is deposited. These calcareous formations do underlie most North Carolinian Lakes, but Lake Waccamaw is the only Bay Lake with these formations.

Lake Waccamaw has many recreation activities available as visitors can camp, fish, hunt, go boating, or picnic. With seven miles of trails to explore, and fifty-two species of game and non-game fish, there is plenty for visitors to do and experience. One of the most popular places to visit and fish at is the Bohemian Girl Scenic Bridge, named in honor of John A McNeil, a celebrated citizen. The bridge completes a 14-mile path around the lake, and has numerous fishing platforms as well as a panoramic view of the lake.

== Development of the lake ==
Many scientists worry about possible contamination of the lake. Lake Waccamaw&#x27;s water is within the acceptable, pre-established, heath guidelines and legal limits established by the Safe Drinking Water Act. However, there is a high level of chloroform present in the Lake, at 4.43 ppb (parts per billion) out of an allowed 14 ppb. Chloroform is a Trihalomethane that is often used as a fumigant for wheat products, a coolant, and as a cleaning spot remover. Chloroform is a naturally occurring substance, but its presence in water is almost always man-made. The lake itself is not man made, as it is a part of the Bladen Lake group, a group of lakes created by receding ocean waters.

== Waccamaw Siouans ==
The Waccamaw Sioux or Waccamaw Siouan are one of eight Indian tribes recognized by the North Carolinian government. The Waccamaw Siouan Indians are not affiliated with the Waccamaw People of North Carolina or the Waccamaw Siouan of Farmers Union South Carolina. The Lake Waccamaw Indians are known as the &quot;People of the Falling Star&quot; because of the humongous meteorite that crashed to earth years ago and created the crater that is now Lake Waccamaw. The Waccamaw Siouan live on the edge of the Green Swamp in a closed, protected swampland refuge. The Waccamaw Indians were originally called the Waccon and then the Waccammassus Indians, but their name was changed to Waccamaw by white settlers as it was more convenient and easy for English settlers to pronounce.

<text>Tabor City ( ) is a town in Columbus County, North Carolina, United States. It is the southernmost town in the county. It is located just north of the North Carolina/South Carolina line, about north of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and is just north of Loris, South Carolina. The population was 2,511 as of the 2010 census.

== History ==

=== Pre-European ===
According to Swanton (1952), before the arrival of the Europeans, the area was home to the Cape Fear Indians, the Waccamaw Indians, and the Saponas.

=== 1670s–1830s ===
During the Revolutionary War, men from the area joined with the rebels in the Battle of Brown Marsh. The Loyalists won, marking the high point of their efforts to defeat the revolution in the southern theater. Men from the area may have also aided the American forces in the Battle of Moore&#x27;s Creek Bridge, which had a much more favorable outcome for the Americans. The Siege of Charleston saw troops from the coastal Carolinas unsuccessfully defend the city from the British.

Early settlers in the area farmed, raised cattle &amp; pigs, and manufactured naval stores. From the longleaf pine trees come products used in shipbuilding. These products or &quot;stores&quot; are turpentine, rosin, tar and pitch. Pitch was needed to coat the hulls of ships to protect them in tropical waters.

Camp meetings filled an ecclesiastical and spiritual need in the unchurched settlements. The Honey Camp meeting site (which became the Green Sea Baptist Church) was one of the first large camp meetings in the region at nearby Green Sea, South Carolina. Population increased and settlement moved inland, which led to the founding of a congregation in the area just north of the state border. Around 1837, the congregation of Mt. Tabor Baptist Church erected their first building, constructed of logs.

=== 1830s–1930s ===
The original community took its name from the first prominent church in the area, the Mount Tabor Baptist Church(now the Tabor City Baptist Church), which itself is named after the biblical Mount Tabor, and was founded in 1838. A village coalesced around the area of the church which was organized as a town shortly after 1840. The town officially incorporated in 1904. The church was originally located near the intersection of what is now Stake Road and East 5th Street.

Business activity started in Tabor City by the mid-1850s, with the development of a saw mill, turpentine still, grocery store and dry goods store. The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad located a station in the town in 1886. The turpentine industry was huge in the area throughout the 19th Century. Many wagonloads of turpentine, rosin and pitch were carried to the rail station in Grist, NC, for shipment to Wilmington, North Carolina and other environs. The town was officially incorporated in 1905. In 1906, William Fowler donated land for the Tabor City Baptist Church, at the site which has been in continuous use since the completion of the construction and is still currently in use, as of April 2023. The new church and sanctuary was completed in 1908.

Mt. Tabor residents were greatly affected by the American Civil War. Many volunteered when the war began and many more were conscripted to fill the ranks as the war decimated the combatants. Men from the area were mainly in two different groups. At war&#x27;s beginning, eager young men joined Capt. John B. Stanly&#x27;s Co.(Columbus Guards # 4), 10th Regt NC Infantry (Volunteers), which became Co D, 20th North Carolina Infantry Regiment, NC State Troops, which participated in most of the major battles in the Virginia theater. At Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, more than sixty-five percent of the regiment were casualties, either from wounds or death. Older men were later conscripted into Co. G, 51st NC Infantry Regiment, which performed garrison duty at forts in the Charleston, South Carolina area and Fort Fisher. It also saw limited action in several of the campaigns in eastern Virginia. Townsmen participated in most of the large battles of the Eastern Theater of the war, fighting in the Carolinas and Virginia. 
In 1865, William T. Sherman&#x27;s army passed through the area, with outriders foraging for foodstuffs and supplies. The blue columns crossed the Pee Dee River, the Lumber River, and the Cape Fear River, with the cavalry scouting ahead. Mt. Tabor was not spared by Sherman&#x27;s foragers. Dozens of men never returned home. Widow&#x27;s weeds were a common sight in this area. Census records in 1870 and 1880 show many households run by widows in South Williams Township.

Strawberries became an important crop in the 1880s when the development of the railroad enabled them to be shipped to markets in the big cities. The Anderson Shingle Company made shipping containers for strawberries. In 1910, Bishop Anderson sold out to W.B. Roberts and David James (Dave) Hughes, three years later Dave Hughes bought out Mr. Robert&#x27;s interest and it became D.J. Hughes &amp; Company &quot;Manufacturers of Anderson Make Strawberry, Cantaloupe, Peach and Grape Crates, Boxes Made to Order, and Lumber,&quot; with a yearly output of 150,000 crates.

Cotton fell out of favor when boll weevils negatively impacted crop production. Tobacco became the golden crop and the Border Belt produced prime flue-cured leaf for tobacco companies around the world. The first tobacco warehouse was built in 1909, which became a major industry for both the town and the surrounding area. By 1925, the town had several tobacco auction warehouses, two tobacco re-drying warehouses, and a tobacco prizery(a packing plant where tobacco was packed into hogsheads for shipment to tobacco companies in Virginia), all within a block of the railroad tracks. The dominance of tobacco in the community continued until the 1990s. By 2022, only a few largescale farmers still grow tobacco in the area.

The First World War took men from the town and deposited them in the trenches of France where they helped the Allied Forces achieve victory against the Central Powers.

Originally named &#x27;Mt. Tabor&#x27;, many would shorten the name to &#x27;Tabor&#x27; when writing correspondence. With mail delivery by the USPS, Tabor would be confused with Tarboro, North Carolina due to the similarities in spelling. By 1935, US Postal authorities demanded a name change and since Tarboro was much larger, Mt Tabor was told to pick another name. The town denizens picked Tabor City as they expected phenomenal growth for the future of this tiny village.

In May 1925, there were no paved streets, no fire department, nor a municipal water supply. Businesses included: a crate factory, several tobacco industries, a power plant, churches, train station, US Post Office, a hotel, a telephone exchange, many businesses, a prizery(tobacco packing house), agricultural, commercial, and industrial warehouses, a grist mill, a concert hall, and schools. Tobacco was the main industry.

During the later 1920s, a boarding house opened, often the choice of traveling businessmen, tobacco buyers, and hunters. The owner of the business, would cook for her guests, leaving the pots on the stove for the boarders to serve themselves. A night&#x27;s stay, including supper and breakfast was $2.00 per day. The business was operated by the family for three generations. The original buildings burned in 1971 and were rebuilt, operating with monthly rental units and a restaurant until 2018. It is now an event venue under new owners.

By February 1934, the face of downtown was formed. A modern-day person would recognize many familiar buildings that appear on the Sanborn Fire Insurance Co. maps of the town for that year. There was a municipal-owned water source from a deep well. A 75,000 gal elevated water tank on a 75 ft steel tower rose above the town. There was one mile of 6&quot; &amp; 8&quot; water lines, giving 45 lbs of domestic &amp; fire water pressure. Businesses noted on those maps included: factories, commercial, and agricultural warehouses, churches, many commercial enterprises, schools, movie theatre, US Post Office, a town hall, a waterworks plant &amp; water tower. Tobacco was the main industry.

=== 1940s–1970s ===
The Second World War saw many young men of the town face combat in both the European and Pacific Theaters of war. The war economy brought prosperity to the town and saw an expansion of new businesses began by war veterans taking advantage of GI Bill loan provisions. During the 1940s and 1950s, the area had at least two movie theaters. There were also several drive-in movie businesses. Gas stations appeared at the town&#x27;s major intersections. The first supermarkets also opened replacing the smaller general stores that had previously served the public. Several car dealerships came to the town. The first Yam Festival was organized and held in 1948.

The &quot;Tabor City Tribune&quot; is a weekly newspaper established by W. Horace Carter (a Stanly County native) in 1946. In 1950, after witnessing a Ku Klux Klan motorcade going through town, Carter began writing a series of editorials and reports critical of Klan activity. The Klan began a recruiting campaign in 1950, and were later convicted of flogging people and other offenses, based largely on Carter&#x27;s work. Along with the &quot;Whiteville News Reporter&quot;, the &quot;Tribune&quot; was awarded the 1953 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for its editorials against the Ku Klux Klan. The Pulitzer Prize citation stated that the newspapers were awarded the prize &quot;for their successful campaign against the Ku Klux Klan, waged on their own doorstep at the risk of economic loss and personal danger, culminating in the conviction of over one hundred Klansmen and an end to terrorism in their communities.&quot; The newspapers were the first weeklies to win a Pulitzer Prize. The name of the &quot;Tabor City Tribune&quot; was changed to the &quot;Tabor-Loris Tribune&quot; in 1996. The small W. Horace Carter Newspaper Museum in Tabor City at the &quot;Tabor-Loris Tribune&quot; offices has exhibits on Carter&#x27;s life and work. A documentary of the struggles between Carter and the Klan, titled &quot;The Editor and the Dragon: Horace Carter Fights the Klan&quot;, was shown on the North Carolina Public Broadcasting System in 2013, on the 50th anniversary of the struggle. In addition, part of Carter&#x27;s story was entered into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; in 2007. Carter&#x27;s death in 2009 was noted in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Even with the Tribune&#x27;s crusade against racism and the Klan, now in 2022, there is a business covered with Confederate flags which sells Klan and other racist merchandise on the main road coming into town. Thus, the battle against racism is at a stalemate in light of Carter&#x27;s crusade in the 1950s.

The Tabor City Methodist Church began services in 1953.

Due to crimes in the area in the late 1950s and 1960s, especially fights at local bars, Tabor City earned the nickname &quot;Razor City&quot;. Even though many of the crimes occurred just across the border in South Carolina, the Razor/Tabor near-rhyme stuck.

An economic downturn and severe recession, plus skyrocketing fuel costs, in the early/mid-1970s resulted in business closures and poverty becoming the norm for many families.

=== 1980s–2010 ===

By the eighties, tobacco use began declining. Along with global recession, the town and its people took another severe hit. More businesses closed and parts of downtown looked deserted as empty buildings fell into disrepair. Tens of millions in US government grants poured into the city beginning in the mid-1980s until present day. The decline in Tabor City was similar to neighboring towns of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, Broadman, North Carolina, Brunswick, North Carolina, Cerro Gordo, North Carolina, and Chadbourn, North Carolina. A town manager was hired to handle administrative duties of the town,

The year 1984, saw a group of townspeople come together to promote economic development in the town. An investment fund was accumulated through donations. Several projects were completed over the following decades. Most projects have seen the group acquire properties which end up receiving multimillion-dollar government grants.

The dismissal of Police Chief Willie Gore in 1993 sparked a period of weekly protest marches since many felt the chief&#x27;s dismissal was racist in nature. The marches were peaceful, though overreaction by the all white police force led to the mostly African American crowd being met with pepper spray on multiple occasions.

In late 1997, a massive facelift was performed on two blocks of S. Main Street in the downtown area. Southern Living magazine made contact with town leaders about an article they were doing about Christmas celebrations in small southern towns. For many decades, the town traditionally held an annual daytime Christmas parade. Storefronts were painted, new retro lampposts installed, and other aesthetic improvements costing tens of thousands of dollars were made in order to have a nighttime Christmas parade. A photo of the parade and short write-up were included in an article in the December 1997 issue of Southern Living magazine.

Today, the town focuses on agriculture, light manufacturing, retail and tourism. In addition, a large state prison provides many jobs for the area. Being so close to the coastal areas of Myrtle Beach and the Brunswick County beaches has led to a growth in the area housing industry.

The Centennial Clock celebrating the town&#x27;s 100th anniversary was installed on Main Street. It was donated by a local business leader. 
The Freedom Flag Trilogy, which is located at the entrance to town on Hwy 701N, was first flown July 4, 2007.

=== 2011–present ===

A local citizen donated the lot containing the ruined front brick wall of the former Ritz theater to the town. Millions in government grants resulted in a complete rebuild effort that was completed in 2014. The former theater is now the Ritz Center, a community center for the arts. The mayor of the town has a comedy act that is a frequent performer. The building sits empty for much of the year.

In 2014, the Chapel Hill, North Carolina band, Campfires and Constellations, memorialized the town in their song about drug smuggling, &quot;Fast Burn to Tabor City&quot;.

On October 25, 2018, it was announced the Todd House would close after 100 years of operation.

Town welcome signs were amended in 2019 to recognize country music legend Stonewall Jackson, a Tabor City native.

In 2019, town leaders continued to develop a plan for a light rail link from the town to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina tourists via Conway. A matter to be addressed is how to get beach tourists to Conway in order to use the rail service. The Town Depot project, renamed the Community Center, is being built adjacent to the railroad tracks behind the town library. Community Center construction began in 2021 and is scheduled to be completed in April 2022. Myrtle Beach city leaders are busy converting their railroad corridor to a 2.5 mile public trail for pedestrians and bikes

==Climate==
Tabor City has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), with the following characteristics:

Winters are generally mild with January highs in the mid 50s °F (11–14 °C) and lows in the mid 30s °F (1–3 °C). Snowfall does not occur in most years, and when it does, is generally light.

Spring is reasonably lengthy, beginning in late February and lasting to early May. The presence of abundant dense vegetation in the area causes significant pollen dusting in the springtime that tends to turn rooftops and cars yellow.

Summer brings high humidity with temperatures usually in the upper 80s to lower 90s °F (31–34 °C). Heat indices can easily break the mark, though the actual temperature does not in most years. Due to the proximity of warm Atlantic Ocean waters, the area may be hit by a hurricane during the summer, at an average of once every seven years- although most are of a low level. About 40% of the annual rainfall is delivered from July to September.

Autumn is also generally humid at the beginning, with the same tropical threats from hurricanes as in the summer. Some of the deciduous trees may lose their leaves; however most trees in the area are evergreens and therefore remain green year-round.

==Culture==
The North Carolina Visitors Center in the middle of town, on business highway 701, assists tourist and locals with these and other activities. The visitor center underwent a series of improvements, funded partially by a $100,000 North Carolina Department of Transportation allocation. As of 2022, the volume of visitors to the center is minuscule.

The North Carolina Yam Festival takes place on the fourth Saturday in October. The festival celebrates with crafts, train rides, classic cars and trucks, arts and vendors. Also during the Yam festival, an annual art show is held, and a &quot;Miss Yam Festival&quot; pageant is held for various age groups. The annual parade is considered a highlight of the festival.

Based somewhat on the success of the fall Yam Festival, an annual spring festival, the Spring Fling, began in 2013, celebrating the Town and people of the area. This week-long festival offers several activities.

Lake Tabor is a one-star rated, 2 acre lake where boating events are often held. Lake Tabor went dry in 1998 after hurricane floods destroyed the retention dam. The dam was rebuilt and the lake restored. It was closed for a part of the 2013, and 2014 summer due to algae infestations. The Lake Tabor dam is still in danger during hurricane flooding events.

The area boasts several restaurants and shops, and Tabor City has several parks and athletic fields as part of the Columbus County Parks and Recreation Department. A business in town offers access to batting cages. Hunting and fishing are popular activities, as well as the over 100 golf courses within of the town. A local campground has a small waterpark. A Fourth of July festival celebrating both past and current military personnel is held annually, with fireworks, food, and other activities. There is normally no charge for this event.

An old train depot today serves as a small museum that operates primarily during the Yam Festival. A retired caboose is one of the displays available for exploration.

<text>Peter IV (Catalan: &quot;Pere IV d&#x27;Aragó;&quot; Aragonese; &quot;Pero IV d&#x27;Aragón;&quot; 5 September 1319 – 6 January 1387), called the Ceremonious (Catalan: &quot;El Cerimoniós&quot;; Aragonese: &quot;el Ceremonioso&quot;), was from 1336 until his death the king of Aragon, Sardinia-Corsica, and Valencia, and count of Barcelona. In 1344, he deposed James III of Majorca and made himself King of Majorca.

His reign was occupied with attempts to strengthen the crown against the Union of Aragon and other such devices of the nobility, with their near constant revolts, and with foreign wars, in Sardinia, Sicily, the Mezzogiorno, Greece, and the Balearics. His wars in Greece made him Duke of Athens and Neopatria in 1381.

==Succession conflicts==

Peter was born at Balaguer, the eldest son and heir of Alfons IV, then Count of Urgell, and his first wife, Teresa d&#x27;Entença. Peter was designated to inherit all of his father&#x27;s title save that of Urgell, which went to his younger brother James.

Upon succeeding his father he called a &quot;corts&quot; in Zaragoza for his coronation. He crowned himself, disappointing the Archbishop of Zaragoza and thus rejecting the surrender Peter II had made to the Papacy, in an otherwise traditional ceremony. According to his own later reports, this act caused him some &quot;distress&quot;. He did, however, affirm the liberties and privileges of Aragon. Also while he was at Zaragoza an embassy from Castile had met him and asked that he promise to uphold the donations of land his father had made to his stepmother Eleanor, but he refused to give a clear answer as to the legitimacy of the donations.

After the festivities in Zaragoza, Peter began on his way to Valencia to receive coronation there. En route he stopped at Lleida to affirm the Usatges and Constitutions of the Principality of Catalonia and receive the homage of his Catalan subjects. This offended Barcelona, at which the ceremony had usually been performed, and the citizens of that city complained to the king, who claimed that Lleida was on his way to Valencia. While in Valencia he decided on the case of his stepmother&#x27;s inheritance, depriving her of income and outlawing her Castilian protector, Peter Ponce of León and Jérica. However, Jérica had enough supporters within Peter&#x27;s domains that Peter was unable to maintain his position and in 1338, through papal mediation, Jérica was reconciled to the king and Eleanor received her land and jurisdictional rights. Peter was largely forced to capitulate by a new invasion from Morocco aimed at Castile and Valencia.

In 1338 he married Maria, second daughter of Philip III and Joan II of Navarre. In May 1339 he allied with Alfonso XI of Castile against Morocco, but his contribution of a fleet had no effect at the pivotal Battle of Río Salado (October 1340).

==Conquest of Majorca==
Early on in his reign, a thorn in Peter&#x27;s side had been James III of Majorca, his brother-in-law, the husband of his sister Constance. James had twice postponed performing the ceremony of homage to Peter, his feudal overlord, and when he finally performed it in 1339 it was on his terms. The rising economic star of Majorca, whose merchants were establishing independent markets and gaining trading privileges in the western Mediterranean, threatened the supremacy of Barcelona. The gold coinage of Majorca and the diplomatic equality granted it by the powers of France and Italy irked Peter further, while James also allied with Abu Al-Hassan, the king of Morocco and Peter&#x27;s enemy. Peter&#x27;s outrage, however, was given no outlet until 1341, when James, threatened with invasion by the French over disputed rights to the Lordship of Montpellier, called on his suzerain Aragon for aid. In order not to offend France nor to support James, Peter summoned the king of Majorca to a &quot;cort&quot; at Barcelona, to which he knew he would not come, and when James or a representative of his failed to appear, Peter declared himself free from the obligations of an overlord to James.

Peter then opened a legal process against James, with the intent of dispossessing him of his kingdom. He alleged that the circulation of James&#x27; coinage in the Counties of Roussillon and Cerdagne to be an infringement on the royal right of monopoly of coinage. This was open to question, considering the ancient customs of Roussillon and Cerdagne, but Peter was prepared to move forward anyway. The interference of Pope Clement VI, however, granted James a hearing in Barcelona in front of papal delegates. Peter, for his part, spread rumours that James was seeking to capture him. James, fearing that Peter would stoop to invading Majorca and seizing it by force, returned to the island to prepare its defence. In February 1343 Peter declared James a contumacious vassal and his kingdom and lands forfeit.

The legal process being terminated, Peter went to war, on the advice that the islanders were burdened by taxes and would readily rise in his support. In May a fleet which had been blockading Algeciras landed at Majorca and quickly defeated James&#x27; army at the Battle of Santa Ponça. Peter received the submission of all the Balearics and confirmed the privileges of the islands as they had been under James I. Though James sued for peace and Pope Clement attempted to mediate it, Peter returned to Barcelona prepared to invade Roussillon and Cerdagne. After these were finally conquered in 1344 James surrendered on a safe conduct, only to find himself ignominiously reduced to the status of a petty lord. In March Peter had declared his realm incorporated into the Crown of Aragon in perpetuity and ceremoniously had himself crowned its king.

==Military career==

By the Pact of Madrid, Peter was constrained to aid Alfonso XI of Castile in his successful attack on Algeciras (1344) and his failed attempt on Gibraltar (1349) by defending against a Moroccan counterattack.

As Peter had no male issue, his brother Count James of Urgell was the presumptive heir to the Aragonese throne. Peter grew to mistrust the intentions of James over time. Peter decided that he would instead name his daughter Constance as his heir presumptive notwithstanding the precedents established by James I and Alfonso IV to exclude females from the throne. To this end, he demanded that James cede his post as procurator general, a position which, by tradition, was reserved for the second in line to the Aragonese throne. James fled to Zaragoza where he gained the favor of certain nobles who wished to reassert their powers via the monarch. Peter eventually succumbed to the pressure to hold a cortes in Zaragoza where he made numerous concessions of royal authority to quell a rebellion he was not yet in a position to crush. One of such concessions was to revoke his attempt to name Constance as heir, and to restore James as procurator general. To avert additional damage, Peter dissolved the corts on the premise that he had to address a crisis developing in Sardinia. Not long thereafter, while Peter was in Catalonia, James suddenly died. Many suspected Peter of having arranged to have James poisoned. Deprived of their leader, the Union of Aragon was greatly weakened.

Venturing next to Valencia, Peter encountered the nascent Valencian Union which had taken its cue from its counterpart in Aragon. At Murviedro (Sagunt), Peter was forced to name his stepbrother Ferran as the new procurator general. Additional concessions of royal authority were made to appease the Unionists. This time when he attempted to leave a bad situation, Peter was held under guard in Valencia as a prisoner of the Union. Suffering perhaps his greatest humility, he and his queen were forced to dance with the common folk to show his subservience. Ironically, his salvation was the Black Death. Valencia was felled by this plague in May 1348, enabling Peter to escape amid the confusion. Assembling an army of increasingly powerful royalists in Aragon, Peter attacked the unionist forces at the Battle of Epila on 21 July 1348. Peter won a complete victory. Proceeding to Saragossa, Peter executed only thirteen Union leaders. By fourteenth century standards, this was a great display of magnanimity. Not the same can be said for the fate of Valencia. After being persuaded not to burn the entire city and sow it with salt, many were executed. Of particular note, he had the bell that the Valencian Union rang to summon its meetings melted down. The molten metal from the bell was then poured down the throats of the Union leaders so that they &quot;should taste its liquor.&quot;

In 1356, he engaged with Peter I of Castile in what was called the &quot;War of the Two Peters&quot;. It ended in 1375 with the Treaty of Almazan, without a winner due to the Black Death and several natural disasters.

He conquered Sicily in 1377 but the possession was given to his son Martin.

Throughout his reign, Peter IV had frequent conflicts with the inquisitor general of Aragon, Nicolas Eymerich.

In 1349, James invaded Majorca, but was soundly defeated by Peter&#x27;s troops at the Battle of Llucmajor, in which he died. After James&#x27; death, Peter allowed James IV, his successor, to retain his royal title on purely formal terms until his death in 1375. After that date, Peter assumed the title. Majorca remained one of the component crowns of the Crown of Aragon until the Nova Planta decrees.

Peter died in Barcelona, aged 67.

==Generalitat==

At the Catalan Courts celebrated at Barcelona, Vilafranca del Penedès and Cervera in 1358–1359, Peter instituted the Deputation of the General or Generalitat. Castile had recently invaded Aragon and Valencia and the cortes decided to streamline the government by designating a dozen deputies to oversee the fiscal and material policies of the Crown. The first &quot;President of the Generalitat&quot; was Berenguer de Cruïlles, Bishop of Girona (1359).

Toward the end of his reign (c. 1370) Peter ordered the compilation of the &quot;Chronicle of Sant Joan de la Penya&quot; to record the historical basis for the authority of the crown.

==Relationship with Jews==
According to historical record, Peter IV of Aragon and his Jewish physician had a friendly disputation regarding the question of why the Jews were not allowed to drink kosher wine touched by a Christian. Thereupon the physician had water brought to wash the king&#x27;s feet, of which he then drank to demonstrate that the fear of impurity was not the reason of the prohibition.

In 1350, in response to the black plague, Peter IV ordered the mayor of Lleida to construct a new Jewish cemetery, as the existing one became overwhelmed by the number of new corpses.

==Marriage and children==
His first marriage, on 23 July 1338 in Alagón, was to Maria (1329 – 29 April 1347), daughter of Philip III of Navarre and Joan II of Navarre. They had four children:
* Constance (1343 – July 1363), who married King Frederick III of Sicily.
* Joanna (7 November 1344 – 1385), who married Count John of Ampurias.
* Maria (1345/6 – 3 June 1348).
* Peter (born and died 28 April 1347).

His second marriage, on 15 November 1347 in Barcelona, was to Eleanor (1328 – 29 October 1348), daughter of Afonso IV of Portugal. She died one year later of the Black Death.

His third marriage, on 27 August 1349 in Valencia, was to Eleanor (1325 – 20 April 1375), daughter of Peter II of Sicily. They had four children:

* John I (27 December 1350 – 19 May 1396).
* Martin I (1356 – 31 May 1410).
* Eleanor (20 February 1358 – 13 September 1382), who married John I of Castile and was the mother of Ferdinand I of Aragon.
* Alfonso (May or June 1362 – 1364).

His last marriage, on 11 October 1377 in Barcelona, was to Sibila (? – 4 or 24 November 1406), daughter of Bernat of Fortià and widow of Artal of Foces, who was previously his mistress. They had three children:

* Alfonso (1376 – 1377). Legitimized in 1377, Count of Morella.
* Peter (born and died April 1379).
*Isabella (1380 – 1424), married Count James II of Urgell and was mother of Isabella of Urgell, Duchess of Coimbra. Through Isabella, Peter and Sibila are ancestors to Joana, Princess of Portugal and John II of Portugal.

<text>Havelock is a city in Craven County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 20,735 at the 2010 census. The city is home to Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, the world&#x27;s largest Marine Corps air station, and home to the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing.

Havelock is part of the New Bern, NC Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Havelock is one of eight cities in the world named after Sir Henry Havelock, a British officer in India, who distinguished himself in 1857 during what was known as the Indian Mutiny. The area was originally named &quot;Havelock Station&quot; in the late 1850s, when the Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad built a depot where its right-of-way crossed what is now Miller Boulevard.

The town was the initial landing point for a Civil War battle known as the Battle of New Bern. On March 11, 1862, Brigadier General Ambrose Burnside&#x27;s command embarked from Roanoke Island to rendezvous with Union gunboats at Hatteras Inlet for an expedition against New Bern. On March 13, the fleet sailed up the Neuse River, anchored at Slocum Creek, and disembarked infantry on the river&#x27;s south bank. Elements of the Rhode Island Heavy Artillery came ashore near the present-day location of the Officers&#x27; Club on Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station and also near the Carolina Pines Golf and Country Club. After the capture of New Bern, the Federals transited Havelock on their way to the Battle of Fort Macon. Despite several Confederate attempts to reclaim New Bern and the surrounding area, the Federals did not withdraw until after the end of the war. During one of the attempts, however, the Union-built blockhouse fort on Havelock&#x27;s Slocom Creek was burned in 1864. A diorama model of the Civil War fort is on exhibit at the Havelock Tourist &amp; Events Center along with other displays of Havelock and Cherry Point history.

Existing records indicate that the production of naval supplies including turpentine and tar were very important in the local economy during the 19th century. With the invention of the steam engine, the demand for tar and turpentine slowly evaporated as fewer wooden ships were constructed. Many distillers of turpentine turned to the production of moonshine to make ends meet.

In 1940, Havelock became the home of Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point. MCAS Cherry Point&#x27;s Fleet Readiness Center East employs many residents of the town. In 1959 the town was officially established.

Jimmy Sanders Sr.served as the mayor of the city from 1987 until the election of former city commissioner William L. Lewis, Jr. in 2013 by a vote of 624–319.

A park in Havelock is named after Rep. Walter B. Jones, Jr.

<doc id="127839" wikidata="Q1002490" url="?curid=127839" title="New Bern, North Carolina">
<text>New Bern (formerly Newbern) is a city in and the county seat of Craven County, North Carolina, United States. At the 2020 census, it had a population of 31,291. It is located at the confluence of the Neuse and the Trent rivers, near the headwaters of Pamlico Sound on the North Carolina coast. It lies east of Raleigh, north of Wilmington, and south of Norfolk.

New Bern was founded in October 1710 by the Palatines and Swiss under the leadership of Christoph von Graffenried. The new colonists named their settlement after Bern, the Swiss region from which many of the colonists and their patron had emigrated. New Bern is the second-oldest European-settled colonial town in North Carolina, after Bath. It served as the capital of North Carolina from 1770 to 1792. After the American Revolution (1775–1783), New Bern became wealthy and quickly developed a rich cultural life. At one time New Bern was called &quot;the Athens of the South,&quot; renowned for its Masonic Temple and Athens Theater. These are both still very active today.

New Bern has four historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places; their numerous contributing buildings include residences, stores and churches dating back to the early eighteenth century. Within walking distance of the waterfront are more than 164 homes and buildings listed on the National Register. Also nearby are several bed and breakfasts, hotels, restaurants, banks, antiques stores and specialty shops. The historic districts contain many of the city&#x27;s 2,000 crape myrtles—its official flower—and developed gardens. New Bern has two &quot;Local Historic Districts&quot;, a municipal zoning overlay that affords legal protection to the exteriors of New Bern&#x27;s historic structures.

==History==
New Bern was settled in October 1710 by the Palatines and Swiss under the leadership of Christoph von Graffenried. The new colonists named their settlement after the Canton of Bern, home state of their patron. Von Graffenried had the original plat of the town laid out in the shape of a cross, though later development and additional streets have obscured this pattern within the regular street grid. The British governor&#x27;s palace (present-day Tryon Palace) served as the capitol of North Carolina from 1770 until the state government relocated to Raleigh in 1792, after a fire had destroyed much of the capitol. This became the first permanent capital city of North Carolina.

There was no printer in North Carolina until 1749, when the North Carolina Assembly commissioned James Davis from Williamsburg, Virginia to act as their official printer. Before this time the laws and legal journals of North Carolina were handwritten and were largely kept in a disorganized manner, prompting them to hire Davis. Davis settled in New Bern and was appointed by Colonial postmaster general Benjamin Franklin as North Carolina&#x27;s first postmaster, who also became active in North Carolina&#x27;s politics, as a member of the Assembly and later as the Sheriff. Davis also founded and printed the &quot;North-Carolina Gazette&quot; in New Bern, North Carolina&#x27;s first newspaper.

During the 19th-century Federal period, New Bern became the largest city in North Carolina, developed on the trade of goods and slaves associated with plantation agriculture. After Raleigh was named the state capital in 1792, New Bern rebuilt its economy by expanding on trade via shipping routes to the Caribbean and New England. It was part of the Triangle Trade in sugar, slaves, and desired goods. It reached a population of 3,600 in 1815.

In 1862 during the early stages of the American Civil War, the area was the site of the Battle of New Bern. Federal forces captured and occupied the town until the end of the war in 1865. Nearly 10,000 enslaved blacks escaped during this period in the region and went to the Union Army camps for protection and freedom. The Union Army set up the Trent River contraband camp at New Bern to house the refugees. It organized the adults for work. Missionaries came to teach literacy to both adults and children.

Due to the continuous occupation by the Union Army, New Bern avoided some of the destruction of the war years. There was much social disruption because of the occupation and the thousands of freedmen camped near the city. Whereas the 1860 Census had shown a population of 5,432 (of which 3,072, or 57%, were black), the population had swollen by the end of the war to more than 20,000, mostly because of the influx of freedmen. Still, New Bern recovered more quickly than many cities after the war. By the 1870s the lumber industry was developing as the chief part of New Bern&#x27;s economy. Timber harvested could be sent downriver by the two nearby rivers. The city continued to be a center for freedmen, who created communities independent of white supervision: thriving churches, fraternal associations, and their own businesses. By 1877 the city had a majority-black population.

The state legislature defined the city and county as part of North Carolina&#x27;s 2nd congressional district which, as former plantation territory, held a concentration of the state&#x27;s black residents. They elected four blacks to the US Congress in the late 19th century. The state&#x27;s passage of a constitutional suffrage amendment in 1900 used various devices to disenfranchise black citizens. As a result, they were totally closed out of the political process, including participation on juries and in local offices; white Democrats maintained this suppression mostly, until after passage of federal civil rights legislation, including the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which provided for federal enforcement of constitutional rights.

By 1890 New Bern had become the largest lumber center in North Carolina and one of the largest in all of the South. During this time, as many as 16 lumber mills were running and employing hundreds of men from New Bern and the area. The competitive nature of the lumber barons, the abundance of lumber and craftsmen, led to the construction in New Bern of some of the finest homes in the South, many of which have survived. The lumber boom lasted until the 1920s. One by one the lumber mills went out of business. Today only Weyerhaeuser manufactures lumber in the area.

The city has four National Historic Districts and two local ones, which have helped preserve the character of the architecture. The Downtown Local Historic District is or ; the Riverside Local Historic District covers or . Union Point Park borders the Neuse and Trent rivers.

===Hurricanes===
New Bern&#x27;s location near the Atlantic coast renders it subject to the effects of Atlantic hurricane seasons. For example, in the 18th century the town suffered severe damage in the Great Chesapeake Bay Hurricane of 1769. Other hurricanes such as Hurricane Ione in 1955 and Hurricane Floyd in 1999 have also caused significant flooding and damage.

In September 2018, Hurricane Florence made landfall in the United States just south of Wrightsville Beach, 88.4 miles southwest of New Bern. A storm surge of up to 13.5 feet, in addition to days of heavy rains, severely flooded various parts of the town. [National Hurricane Center Storm Surge Inundation Map, Sept 13, 2018]

<text>Fayetteville ( , ) is a city in and the county seat of Cumberland County, North Carolina, United States. It is best known as the home of Fort Bragg, a major U.S. Army installation northwest of the city.

Fayetteville has received the All-America City Award from the National Civic League four times. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 208,501, It is the 6th-most populous city in North Carolina. Fayetteville is in the Sandhills in the western part of the Coastal Plain region, on the Cape Fear River.

With an estimated population of 392,336 in 2023, the Fayetteville metropolitan area is the second-most populous in southeastern North Carolina and 142nd-most populous in the United States. Suburban areas of metro Fayetteville include Fort Bragg, Hope Mills, Spring Lake, Raeford, Pope Field, Rockfish, Stedman, and Eastover.

==History==
===Early settlement===
The area of present-day Fayetteville was historically inhabited by various Siouan Native American peoples, such as the Eno, Shakori, Waccamaw, Keyauwee, and Cape Fear people. They followed successive cultures of other indigenous peoples in the area for more than 12,000 years.

After the violent upheavals of the Yamasee War and Tuscarora Wars during the second decade of the 18th century, the colonial government of North Carolina encouraged colonial settlement along the upper Cape Fear River, the only navigable waterway entirely within the colony. Two inland settlements, Cross Creek and Campbellton, were established by Scots from Campbeltown, Argyll and Bute, Scotland.

Merchants in Wilmington wanted a town on the Cape Fear River to secure trade with the frontier country. They were afraid people would use the Pee Dee River and transport their goods to Charleston, South Carolina. The merchants bought land from Newberry in Cross Creek. Campbellton became a place where poor whites and free blacks lived and gained a reputation for lawlessness.

In 1783, Cross Creek and Campbellton united, and the new town was incorporated as Fayetteville in honor of Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, a French military hero who significantly aided the American forces during the war. Fayetteville was the first city to be named in his honor in the United States. Lafayette visited the city on March 4 and 5, 1825, during his grand tour of the United States.

===American Revolution===

The local region was heavily settled by Scots in the mid/late 1700s, and most of these were Gaelic-speaking Highlanders. The vast majority of Highland Scots, recent immigrants, remained loyal to the British government and rallied to the call to arms from the Royal Governor. Despite this, they were eventually defeated by a larger Revolutionary force at the Battle of Moore&#x27;s Creek Bridge. The area also included several active Revolutionaries.

In late June 1775, residents drew up the &quot;Liberty Point Resolves,&quot; which preceded the Declaration of Independence by a little more than a year. It said,
&quot;This obligation to continue in full force until a reconciliation shall take place between Great Britain and America, upon constitutional principles, an event we most ardently desire; and we will hold all those persons inimical to the liberty of the colonies, who shall refuse to subscribe to this Association; and we will in all things follow the advice of our General Committee respecting the purposes aforesaid, the preservation of peace and good order, and the safety of individual and private property.&quot; Robert Rowan, who apparently organized the group, signed first.

Robert Rowan (circa 1738–1798) was one of the area&#x27;s leading public figures of the 18th century. A merchant and entrepreneur, he settled in Cross Creek in the 1760s. He served as an officer in the French and Indian War, as sheriff, justice and legislator, and as a leader of the Patriot cause in the Revolutionary War. Rowan Street and Rowan Park in Fayetteville and a local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution are named for him, though Rowan County (founded in 1753) was named for his uncle, Matthew Rowan.

Flora MacDonald (1722–1790), a Scots Highland woman known for aiding Bonnie Prince Charlie after his Highlander army&#x27;s defeat at Culloden in 1746, lived in North Carolina for about five years. She was a staunch Loyalist and aided her husband in raising the local Scots to fight for the King against the Revolution.

Seventy-First Township in western Cumberland County (now a part of Fayetteville) is named for a British regiment during the American Revolution – the 71st Regiment of Foot or &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Highlanders&quot;, as they were first called.

===Post-revolution===

Fayetteville had what is sometimes called its &quot;golden decade&quot; during the 1780s. It was the site in 1789 for the state convention that ratified the U.S. Constitution, and for the General Assembly session that chartered the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Fayetteville lost out to the future city of Raleigh in the bid to become the permanent state capital.

In 1793, the Fayetteville Independent Light Infantry formed and is still active as a ceremonial unit. It is the second-oldest militia unit in the country.

Henry Evans (circa 1760–1810), a free black preacher, is locally known as the &quot;Father of Methodism&quot; in the area. Evans was a shoemaker by trade and a licensed Methodist preacher. He met opposition from whites when he began preaching to enslaved people in Fayetteville, but he later attracted whites to his services. He is credited with building the first church in town, the African Meeting House, in 1796. Evans Metropolitan AME Zion Church is named in his honor.

On March 4–5, 1825, General Lafayette visited his namesake town - the first one named for him and the only one he personally visited as part of his 1824-1825 tour of all the states as &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Guest.&quot; Admirers stood in mud and pouring rain to welcome him. He was feted with a formal dinner, a ball, and multiple military displays.

===Antebellum===
Fayetteville had 3,500 residents in 1820, but Cumberland County&#x27;s population still ranked as the second most urban in the state, behind New Hanover County (Wilmington). Its &quot;Great Fire&quot; of 1831 was believed to be one of the worst in the nation&#x27;s history, despite no deaths associated with the incident. Hundreds of homes, businesses, and most of the best-known public buildings were lost, including the old &quot;State House&quot;. Fayetteville leaders moved quickly to help the victims and rebuild the town.

There was no point in rebuilding the State House since the state government was firmly installed in Raleigh. On its site, the city built a Market House, recreating the city around it just as it had previously surrounded the State House. The new building had a covered area under which business could be conducted since every store in Fayetteville had been destroyed in the fire. Completed in 1832, it became the town&#x27;s and county&#x27;s administrative building. It was a town market until 1906 and served as Fayetteville Town Hall until 1907. Currently (2020), it is a local history museum.

===The Civil War era through late 19th century===
In March 1865, Gen. William T. Sherman and his 60,000-man army attacked Fayetteville and destroyed the Confederate arsenal (designed by the Scottish architect William Bell). Sherman&#x27;s troops also destroyed foundries and cotton factories, and the offices of &quot;The Fayetteville Observer&quot;. Not far from Fayetteville, Confederate and Union troops engaged in the last cavalry battle of the Civil War, the Battle of Monroe&#x27;s Crossroads.

Downtown Fayetteville was the site of a skirmish, as Confederate Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton and his men surprised a cavalry patrol, killing 11 Union soldiers and capturing a dozen on March 11, 1865.

During the late nineteenth century, North Carolina adopted Jim Crow laws that imposed racial segregation.

===20th century to present===

Cumberland County&#x27;s population increased in the post-World War II years, with its 43% increase in the 1960s the largest in any of North Carolina&#x27;s 100 counties. Construction was fast-paced as shopping developments, and suburban subdivisions began to spread outside the Fayetteville city limits toward Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base. The Fayetteville and Cumberland County school systems moved toward integration gradually, beginning in the early 1960s; busing brought about wider-scale student integration in the 1970s.

Segregation of public facilities continued. Marches and sit-ins during the Civil Rights Movement, with students from Fayetteville State Teachers College (Fayetteville State University) at the forefront, led to the end of whites-only service at restaurants and segregated seating in theaters. Blacks and women gained office in significant numbers from the late 1960s to the early 1980s.

The Vietnam Era was a time of change in the Fayetteville area. From 1966 to 1970, more than 200,000 soldiers trained at Fort Bragg before leaving for Vietnam. This buildup stimulated area businesses. Anti-war protests in Fayetteville drew national attention because of Fort Bragg, a city that generally supported the war. Anti-war groups invited the actress and activist Jane Fonda to Fayetteville to participate in three anti-war events. The era also saw an increase in crime and drug addiction, especially along Hay Street, with media giving the city the nickname &quot;Fayettenam&quot;. At this time, Fayetteville also made headlines after Army doctor Jeffrey R. MacDonald murdered his pregnant wife and two daughters in their Ft. Bragg home in 1970; the book and movie &quot;Fatal Vision&quot; were based on these events.

To combat the dispersal of suburbanization, Fayetteville has worked to redevelop its downtown through various revitalization projects; it has attracted large commercial and defense companies such as Purolator, General Dynamics and Wal-Mart Stores and Distribution Center. Development of the Airborne &amp; Special Operations Museum, Fayetteville Area Transportation Museum, Fayetteville Linear Park, and Fayetteville Festival Park, which opened in late 2006, have added regional attractions to the center.

In the first decade of the 21st century, the towns and rural areas surrounding Fayetteville had rapid growth. Suburbs such as Hope Mills, Raeford, and Spring Lake had population increases.

In 2005, Congress passed the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Act, resulting in several new commands relocating to Fort Bragg. These include the U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) and U.S. Army Reserve Command, both of which relocated from Fort McPherson in Atlanta. More than 30,000 people were expected to relocate to the area with associated businesses and families. FORSCOM awards over $300 billion in contracts annually.

In the November/December 2009 issue of &quot;Where to Retire&quot;, the magazine named Fayetteville as one of the best places to retire in the United States for military retirements.

In April 2019, a report by GoBankingRates (which analyzed data from 175 American cities) listed Fayetteville as one of the top ten American cities at risk of a severe housing crash. 26.8% of home mortgages in Fayetteville were listed as being &quot;under water&quot;, while the median home value was listed as $108,000.

In December 2015, Fayetteville unveiled the Guinness World Record for the biggest Christmas stocking, weighing approximately , and measuring 74.5 x 139 feet.

===Fort Bragg and Pope Army Airfield===
Fort Bragg and Pope Army Airfield Field are in the northern part of the city of Fayetteville.

Several U.S. Army airborne units are stationed at Fort Bragg, most prominently the XVIII Airborne Corps HQ, the 82nd Airborne Division, the United States Army Special Operations Command, the 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne), and the United States Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School.

Fort Bragg was the home of the Field Artillery at the onset of World War II. All the Army&#x27;s artillery units east of the Mississippi River were based at the post, about 5,000 troops. Soldiers tested the Army&#x27;s new bantam car, soon known as the Jeep, although most of the power to move artillery still came from horses and burros. On September 12, 1940, the Army contracted to expand the post, bringing the 9th Infantry Division to Fort Bragg.

The mission of Pope Field is to provide airlift to American armed forces and humanitarian missions flown worldwide. Pope Field mainly includes air transportation for the 82nd Airborne, among other airborne units on Fort Bragg.

All of Pope&#x27;s fighter jet squadrons have been relocated to Moody AFB, Georgia. The central entity at Pope is now the Air Force Reserve, although they still have a small number of active personnel.

In September 2008, Fayetteville annexed 85% of Fort Bragg, bringing the city&#x27;s population to 206,000. Fort Bragg retains its police, fire, and EMS services. Fayetteville hopes to attract large retail businesses to the area using the new population figures.

===Sanctuary community for military families===
On September 5, 2008, Cumberland County announced it was the &quot;World&#x27;s First Sanctuary for Soldiers and Their Families&quot;; it marked major roads with blue and white &quot;Sanctuary&quot; signage. Within the county, soldiers were to be provided with local services, ranging from free childcare to job placement for soldiers&#x27; spouses.

Five hundred volunteers have signed up to watch over military families. They were recruited to offer one-to-one services; member businesses will also offer discounts and preferential treatment. &quot;Time&quot; magazine recognized Fayetteville for its support of military families and identified it as &quot;America&#x27;s Most Pro-Military Town&quot;.

<text>Fort Bragg (formerly Fort Liberty from 2023 to 2025), is a U.S. Army military installation located in North Carolina. It ranks among the largest military bases in the world by population, with more than 52,000 military personnel. On February 10, 2025, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth signed a memorandum directing the Army to begin the process of renaming the base in honor of U.S. Army paratrooper Private First Class Roland L. Bragg.

Covering more than , Fort Bragg is home to the Army&#x27;s XVIII Airborne Corps and serves as the headquarters of the U.S. Army Special Operations Command, which oversees the 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) and the 75th Ranger Regiment. Additionally, it hosts the 82nd Airborne Division, U.S. Army Forces Command, U.S. Army Reserve Command, and Womack Army Medical Center. Fort Bragg also operates two airfields: Pope Field, where the U.S. Air Force stations global airlift and special operations units, as well as the Air Force Combat Control School, and Simmons Army Airfield, which supports Army aviation units for airborne and special operations missions.

==History==
===World War I===
Camp Bragg was established in 1918 as an artillery training ground. The Chief of Field Artillery, General William J. Snow, was seeking an area having suitable terrain, adequate water, rail facilities, and a climate suitable for year-round training, and he decided that the area met all of the desired criteria. Camp Bragg was originally named after Braxton Bragg, a former U.S. Army artillery commander and West Point graduate who later became a general for the Confederacy during the American Civil War.

The aim was for six artillery brigades to be stationed there and $6,000,000 was spent on the land and cantonments. There was an airfield on the camp used by aircraft and balloons for artillery spotters. The airfield was named Pope Field on 1 April 1919, in honor of First Lieutenant Harley H. Pope, an airman who was killed while flying nearby. The work on the camp was finished on 1 November 1919.

The original plan for six brigades was abandoned after World War I ended and once demobilization had started. The artillerymen, and their equipment and material from Camp McClellan, Alabama, were moved to Camp Bragg and testing began on long-range weapons that were a product of the war. The six artillery brigades were reduced to two cantonments and a garrison was to be built for Army troops as well as a National Guard training center. In early 1921 two field artillery units, the 13th and 17th Field Artillery Brigades, began training at Camp Bragg. The same year, the Long Street Church and six acres of property were acquired for the reservation. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

Due to the post-war cutbacks, the camp was nearly closed for good when the War Department issued orders to close the camp on 7 August 1921. Brig. Gen. Albert J. Bowley was commander at the camp and after much campaigning, and getting the Secretary of War to visit the camp, the closing order was canceled on 16 September 1921. The Field Artillery Board was transferred to Camp Bragg on 1 February 1922.

Camp Bragg was renamed Fort Bragg, to signify becoming a permanent Army post, on 30 September 1922. From 1923 to 1924 permanent structures were constructed on Fort Bragg, including four barracks.

===World War II===
By 1940, the year after World War II started, the population of Fort Bragg was 5,400 and by the following year had reached 67,000. Various units trained at Fort Bragg during World War II, including the 9th Infantry Division, 2nd Armored Division, 82nd Airborne Division, 100th Infantry Division, and various field artillery groups. The population reached a peak of 159,000 during the war years.

===Cold War===

Following World War II, the 82nd Airborne Division was permanently stationed at Fort Bragg, the only large unit there for some time. In July 1951, the XVIII Airborne Corps was reactivated at Fort Bragg. Fort Bragg became a center for unconventional warfare, with the creation of the Psychological Warfare Center in April 1952, followed by the 10th Special Forces Group.

In 1961, the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was activated at Fort Bragg, with the mission of training counter-insurgency forces in Southeast Asia. Also in 1961, the &quot;Iron Mike&quot; statue, a tribute to all Airborne soldiers, past, present, and future was dedicated. In early 1962 the 326 Army Security Agency Company, de-activated after the Korean War, was reactivated at Fort Bragg under XVIIIth Corps. In August of that year, an operational contingent of that Company was relocated to Homestead AFB Florida, due to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Circa 1963, that contingent was reassigned to the newly created USASA 6th Field Station. More than 200,000 young men underwent basic combat training here during the period 1966–70. At the peak of the Vietnam War in 1968, Fort Bragg&#x27;s military population rose to 57,840. In June 1972, the 1st Corps Support Command arrived at Fort Bragg.

In the 1980s, there was a series of deployments of tenant units to the Caribbean, first to Grenada in 1983, Honduras in 1988, and to Panama in 1989. The 5th Special Forces Group departed Fort Bragg in the late 1980s.

===Middle East wars===

In 1990, the XVIII Airborne Corps and the 82nd Airborne Division deployed to Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. In the mid- and late 1990s, there was increased modernization of the facilities in Fort Bragg. The World War II wooden barracks were largely removed, a new main post exchange was built, and Devers Elementary School was opened, along with several other projects.

As a result of campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, the units on Fort Bragg have seen a sizeable increase to their operations tempo (OPTEMPO), with units conducting two, three, or even four or more deployments to combat zones. As directed by law, and in accordance with the recommendations of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission, Fort McPherson, Georgia, closed and U.S. Army Forces Command and U.S. Army Reserve Command relocated to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. A new FORSCOM/U.S. Army Reserve Command Headquarters facility completed construction at Fort Bragg in June 2011. Forces Command hosted 24 June 2011, an Army &quot;Casing of the Colors&quot; ceremony on Fort McPherson and an &quot;uncasing of colors ceremony&quot; on 1 August 2011, at Fort Bragg. On 1 March 2011, Pope Field, the former Pope Air Force Base, was absorbed into Fort Bragg.

=== Name changes ===
On 1 January 2021, the United States Senate passed a veto override of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. This new law established a commission which would select new names for Department of Defense properties named in honor of Confederate leaders. In the law, Congress determined that those who chose to side with the Confederate Army during the American Civil War were unworthy of being namesakes. In March 2022, the commission published a list of 87 potential names for nine Army installations, including Fort Bragg.

In May 2022, the commission officially recommended that Bragg be renamed Fort Liberty. The commission gave the Pentagon until October to accept the name change; Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin did so on 6 October 2022. According to a memorandum published by the Pentagon at the time, the new name changes cost the Department of Defense $62.5 million. In particular, the change to Fort Liberty was calculated to cost the Department of Defense $6,374,230, making it the most expensive name change. In accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act, the local garrison had until early 2024 to complete the name change. On 2 June 2023, Fort Liberty officially adopted its new name in a public ceremony.

On 10 February 2025, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued a memorandum directing the Army to rename Fort Liberty back to Fort Bragg, but this time in honor of Private First Class Roland L. Bragg, a person other than the original namesake. Bragg was stationed at Fort Bragg during World War II and later fought with distinction in the European theater. He received the Silver Star for gallantry and the Purple Heart for wounds sustained, during the Battle of the Bulge. He was recognized for having saved a fellow soldier&#x27;s life by commandeering an enemy ambulance. Bragg&#x27;s name was one of thousands submitted by the public before officials decided to name the base Fort Liberty instead of naming it after an individual. The renaming took effect on 14 February 2025.

==Tenant units==
The major commands at the installation are the United States Army Forces Command, the United States Army Reserve Command, and the United States Army Special Operations Command. Several airborne and special operations units of the United States Army are stationed at Fort Bragg, notably the 82nd Airborne Division, the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne), and the Delta Force. The latter is controlled by the Joint Special Operations Command, based at Pope Field within Fort Bragg.

==Geography==
Fort Bragg is at 35°8&#x27;21&quot; north, 78°59&#x27;57&quot; west (35.139064, −78.999143).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the post has a total area of , of which of it is land and of it is water. The total area is 0.32% water.

Kiest, Simmons, Boundary Line, McFayden, Hurley and Holland lakes are intensively managed to maintain fish populations. Croatan, Quail, Deer Pen, Overhills, Big Muddy, Little Muddy, Texas, MacArthur, Smith, Mott, and Lindsay lakes are managed, but are not normally treated or restocked since their fish populations are respectable and are maintained naturally. A 1.1 MW floating solar plant with a 2 MW battery was installed on Big Muddy lake for $36 million.


Fort Bragg is the only locality where the endangered Saint Francis&#x27; satyr butterfly (&quot;Neonympha mitchellii francisci&quot;) is known to occur. St. Francis&#x27; satyr is found in wetland habitats dominated by graminoids and sedges, such as abandoned beaver dams or along streams with beavers.

Fort Bragg fever, a bacterial zoonotic disease, has been named after it, in reference to an outbreak in 1942.

In 1990, the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker came under the protection of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This caused a tremendous problem for Fort Bragg, where many of these birds lived. Training stopped, ranges were closed, and troops were temporarily moved to other installations for training.

The Army and the conservationists eventually came to an agreement, which put in place training restrictions around the woodpeckers&#x27; habitat. White stripes were painted on trees to indicate the location of the habitats, and restrictions limited the scope and duration of training that could take place within of these locations.

Today, the clusters of woodpeckers has more than doubled in size (200 to 493), and many of the training restrictions have been lifted.

<text>Hope Mills is a town in Cumberland County, North Carolina, United States. Its population was 15,176 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Chartered in 1891, Hope Mills can trace its beginning back to 1766, when due to the wealth of natural water power and the abundance of timber, a lumber camp, saw mill, grist mill, and pottery business were established. In 1839, construction of the first cotton mill powered by the Hope Mills Dam was completed and was the beginning of a new era for the town. Much of the heritage and the town&#x27;s name itself can be attributed to the cotton-milling industry that followed.

Before it was known as Hope Mills, the area was known as Little Rockfish Village and as Hope Mills Number One.

The local cotton mill and many other buildings were burned by General Sherman&#x27;s troops during the Civil War.

The Big Rockfish Presbyterian Church and Hope Mills Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Spring Lake is a town in Cumberland County, North Carolina, United States. The 2010 census recorded the population at 11,964 people, with an estimated population in 2019 of 12,005.

== History ==
The current name of the town first appeared around 1923 for a spring fed lake, which probably formed when the railroad was built about 1860. The community grew slowly until World War II. At its incorporation, the town selected the post office on Main Street as the center of town. The town limits extended only eight-tenths of a mile from its center, but increased rapidly as nearby Fort Bragg was built up. Today, Spring Lake remains a quaint town with its close ties to nearby Fort Bragg. 

Previously, the area was called &quot;Clayton Cut&quot;, due to the pathway cut that ran through the area where the railroad later resided, and also &quot;Prince&#x27;s Siding&quot;, after a man named Prince who owned a sawmill on this land.

Spring Lake was officially incorporated on April 9, 1951. Grady Howard was named interim mayor on this date, and was officially elected the first mayor of Spring Lake on June 5, 1951.

The modern growth spurt beginning in World War II is attributed to the proximity of Fort Bragg.

Long Valley Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.

==Law and government==
In May 2009, Spring Lake&#x27;s police department was stripped of its authority, with the Cumberland County Sheriff&#x27;s Office assuming command in the town. This happened after two of its senior officers were arrested on an array of charges including embezzlement, larceny, obstruction of justice, second-degree kidnapping, and breaking and entering. The District Attorney dropped the majority of misdemeanor cases the department had investigated, saying &quot;We can no longer rely upon the basic presumed integrity of the work product of this department.&quot; Chief of Police A.C. Brown resigned in the aftermath of the scandal. The town has since revamped the department with the hiring of new officers and a new police chief, Dysoaneik Spellman. The power to investigate misdemeanors was restored in 2010.

Spring Lake is served by a mayor and town board. Members are elected for two year renewable terms. The current board consists of mayor Kia Anthony and aldermen Marvin Lackman, Raul Palacios as well as alderwomen Adrian Jones Thompson, Sona Cooper and mayor pro-tem Robyn Chadwick.

The next municipal election in Spring Lake will be in November 2023.

<text>Manteo ( ) is a town in Dare County, North Carolina, United States, located on Roanoke Island. The population was 1,602 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Dare County.

==Geography==
Manteo is located at (35.904595, -75.669385), on the north central area of Roanoke Island. It is located off the exit at the South 16 mile post on US Hwy 158 at Whalebone Junction, the junction of NC Highways 158, 64, and 12, known as the Beach Road.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.09%, is water.

==History==
The town is named for an American Indian named Manteo, a Croatan. Manteo traveled with the English to London in 1584 where he and another Indian, Wanchese, learned to become the liaisons between the Roanoke Colony settlers and the Indians. He also had favorable interaction with British colonist John White. In fact, Manteo was christened and given the name Lord of Roanoke, making him the first American Indian to receive a title of nobility. Eventually, John White&#x27;s daughter Eleanor married Ananias Dare, and they had the first American-born English child, Virginia Dare. In 1587, Manteo was friendly to White when he returned to find what the final stage of the Roanoke Colony became. When the colonists disappeared after supplies from England were delayed for three years, the ongoing mystery of &quot;The Lost Colony&quot; began.

Manteo was named the seat of government for Dare County in 1870, and was incorporated in 1899.

Dare County is named for Virginia Dare.

In 1999, North Carolina public radio (NPR), WUNC, began broadcasting in Manteo as part of an effort to bring public radio to one of the largest areas on the East Coast of the United States without such service.

In 2005, Manteo restored its coastal warning display tower, and it is now operated by the Manteo branch of the North Carolina Maritime Museum.

The George Washington Creef House, John T. Daniels House, Fort Raleigh National Historic Site, and Theodore S. Meekins House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>The County of Ribagorza or Ribagorça (; ; ) was a medieval county on the southern side of the Pyrenees, including the northeast of modern Aragón and part of the northwest of modern Catalonia, both in Spain. It was originally the independent creation of a local dynasty, later absorbed into the Kingdom of Navarre and then into the Crown of Aragon. It had a strong historical connection with the neighboring counties of Sobrarbe (to the west) and Pallars (to the east). Its territory consisted of the valleys of the rivers Ésera, Isábena, and Noguera Ribagorzana. The seat of its counts was at Benabarre. Other notable towns include Benasque, Graus and Pont de Suert. Today the western portion of the county roughly corresponds to the Aragonese &quot;comarca&quot; of Ribagorza, with its administrative centre in Graus; the eastern portion roughly corresponds to the Catalan &quot;comarca&quot; of Alta Ribagorça.

The first history of the region was written in the early fifteenth century and preserved in a &quot;fragmentum historicum ex cartulario Alaonis&quot; (historical fragment from a cartulary of Alaon), though a genealogy of the ruling dynasty of counts perhaps dating from the early 11th century appears in the &quot;Códice de Roda&quot;.

==List of counts==
*Raymond I of Pallars and Ribagorza (872–920), son of Lupe, count of Bigorre. After his death his lands were divided among his four sons, two ruling jointly in Pallars, two in Ribagorza
*Miro (920–?), son of Raymond I, jointly with brother Bernard I
*Bernard I Humfred (I) (920 – 950/955), son of Raymond I, jointly with brother Miro. Through his marriage to Toda Galíndez of Aragon he and his successors were (sometimes only nominally) also counts of Sobrarbe.
*Raymond II (950/955 – 970), son of Bernard I
*Humfred (II) (970–979), son of Raymond II
*Arnold (979–990), son of Raymond II
*Isarn (990–1003), son of Raymond II
*Tota (1003–1010), daughter of Raymond II
*&quot;Partitioned following intervention by Sancho García of Castile&quot;
**William Isarn (1010–1018), illegitimate son of Isarn
**Mayor García (1010–1025), granddaughter of Raymond II and sister of Sancho García of Castile, until 1019/20 she claimed the county jointly with her husband
**Raymond III of Pallars, (1010–1025), distant cousin (both descended from Raymond I) and husband of Mayor García, he was co-claimant until their 1019/20 divorce, then counter-claimant
*Sancho III of Pamplona (1018–1035), ruler first of William Isarn&#x27;s portion, then of the entire county by conquest and submission, he married Muniadona of Castile, niece and eventual heiress of Mayor García and great-granddaughter of Raymond II
*Gonzalo (1035–1045), son of Sancho III, ruled as &quot;regulus&quot; (petty king) or &quot;rex&quot; (king) of Ribagorza and Sobrarbe
*&quot;Absorbed into the territories of his brother Ramiro I of Aragon on Gonzalo&#x27;s death, on occasion created as an appanage.&quot;
**Sancho Ramírez, illegitimate son of Ramiro I and half-brother of king Sancho Ramírez.
**Peter I of Aragon and Navarre appeared as King of Ribagorza and Sobrarbe during the reign of his father, king Sancho Ramírez.
**Peter (1322–1381), a younger son of James II of Aragon.
**Alfonso of Aragon and Foix (1381–1412), son of Peter
**Alfonso of Aragon and Eiximenis (1412–1425), son of Alfonso, following his death the county reverted to the crown of Aragon

<text>Integrity is the quality of being honest and showing a consistent and uncompromising adherence to strong moral and ethical principles and values.
In ethics, integrity is regarded as the honesty and truthfulness or of one&#x27;s actions. Integrity can stand in opposition to hypocrisy. It regards internal consistency as a virtue, and suggests that people who hold apparently conflicting values should account for the discrepancy or alter those values.

The word &quot;integrity&quot; evolved from the Latin adjective , meaning &quot;whole&quot; or &quot;complete&quot;. In this context, integrity is the inner sense of &quot;wholeness&quot; deriving from qualities such as honesty and consistency of character.

== In ethics ==
In ethics, a person is said to possess the virtue of integrity if the person&#x27;s actions are based upon an internally consistent framework of principles. These principles should uniformly adhere to sound logical axioms or postulates. A person has ethical integrity to the extent that the person&#x27;s actions, beliefs, methods, measures, and principles align with a well-integrated core group of values. A person must, therefore, be flexible and willing to adjust these values to maintain consistency when these values are challenged—such as when observed results are incongruous with expected outcomes. Because such flexibility is a form of accountability, it is regarded as a moral responsibility as well as a virtue.

A person&#x27;s value system provides a framework within which the person acts in ways that are consistent and expected. Integrity can be seen as the state of having such a framework and acting congruently within it.

One essential aspect of a consistent framework is its avoidance of any unwarranted (arbitrary) exceptions for a particular person or group—especially the person or group that holds the framework. In law, this principle of universal application requires that even those in positions of official power can be subjected to the same laws as pertain to their fellow citizens. In personal ethics, this principle requires that one should not act according to any rule that one would not wish to see universally followed. For example, one should not steal unless one would want to live in a world in which everyone was a thief. The philosopher Immanuel Kant formally described the principle of universality of application for one&#x27;s motives in his categorical imperative.

The concept of integrity implies a wholeness—a comprehensive corpus of beliefs often referred to as a worldview. This concept of wholeness emphasizes honesty and authenticity, requiring that one act at all times in accordance with one&#x27;s worldview.

Ethical integrity is not synonymous with the good, as Zuckert and Zuckert show about Ted Bundy:

== In politics ==
Politicians are given power to make, execute, or control policy, which can have important consequences. They typically promise to exercise this power in a way that serves society, but may not do so, which opposes the notion of integrity. Aristotle said that because rulers have power they will be tempted to use it for personal gain.

In the book &quot;The Servant of the People&quot;, Muel Kaptein says integrity should start with politicians knowing what their position entails, because the consistency required by integrity applies also to the consequences of one&#x27;s position. Integrity also demands knowledge and compliance with both the letter and the spirit of the written and unwritten rules. Integrity is also acting consistently not only with what is generally accepted as moral, what others think, but primarily with what is ethical, what politicians should do based on reasonable arguments.

Important virtues of politicians are faithfulness, humility, and accountability. Furthermore, they should be authentic and a role model. Aristotle identified dignity (, variously translated as proper pride, greatness of soul, and magnanimity) as the crown of the virtues, distinguishing it from vanity, temperance, and humility.

== In psychological/work-selection tests ==

&quot;Integrity tests&quot; or (more confrontationally) &quot;honesty tests&quot; aim to identify prospective employees who may hide perceived negative or derogatory aspects of their past, such as a criminal conviction or drug abuse. Identifying unsuitable candidates can save the employer from problems that might otherwise arise during their term of employment. Integrity tests make certain assumptions, specifically:
* that persons who have &quot;low integrity&quot; report more dishonest behaviour
* that persons who have &quot;low integrity&quot; try to find reasons to justify such behaviour
* that persons who have &quot;low integrity&quot; think others more likely to commit crimes—like theft, for example. (Since people seldom sincerely declare to prospective employers their past deviance, the &quot;integrity&quot; testers adopted an indirect approach: letting the work-candidates talk about what they think of the deviance of other people, considered in general, as a written answer demanded by the questions of the &quot;integrity test&quot;.)
* that persons who have &quot;low integrity&quot; exhibit impulsive behaviour
* that persons who have &quot;low integrity&quot; tend to think that society should severely punish deviant behaviour (specifically, &quot;integrity tests&quot; assume that people who have a history of deviance report within such tests that they support harsher measures applied to the deviance exhibited by other people.)

The claim that such tests can detect &quot;fake&quot; answers plays a crucial role in detecting people who have low integrity. Naive respondents really believe this pretense and behave accordingly, reporting some of their past deviance and their thoughts about the deviance of others, fearing that if they do not answer truthfully their untrue answers will reveal their &quot;low integrity&quot;. These respondents believe that the more candid they are in their answers, the higher their &quot;integrity score&quot; will be.

== In other disciplines ==

Disciplines and fields with an interest in integrity include philosophy of action, philosophy of medicine, mathematics, the mind, cognition, consciousness, materials science, structural engineering, and politics. Popular psychology identifies personal integrity, professional integrity, artistic integrity, and intellectual integrity.

For example, to behave with scientific integrity, a scientific investigation shouldn&#x27;t determine the outcome in advance of the actual results. As an example of a breach of this principle, Public Health England, a UK Government agency, stated that they upheld a line of government policy in advance of the outcome of a study that they had commissioned.

The concept of integrity may also feature in business contexts that go beyond the issues of employee/employer honesty and ethical behavior, notably in marketing or branding contexts. Brand &quot;integrity&quot; gives a company&#x27;s brand a consistent, unambiguous position in the mind of their audience. This is established for example via consistent messaging and a set of graphics standards to maintain visual integrity in marketing communications. Kaptein and Wempe developed a theory of corporate integrity that includes criteria for businesses dealing with moral dilemmas.

Another use of the term &quot;integrity&quot; appears in Michael Jensen&#x27;s and Werner Erhard&#x27;s paper, &quot;Integrity: A Positive Model that Incorporates the Normative Phenomenon of Morality, Ethics, and Legality&quot;. The authors model integrity as the state of being whole and complete, unbroken, unimpaired, sound, and in perfect condition. They posit a model of integrity that provides access to increased performance for individuals, groups, organizations, and societies. Their model &quot;reveals the causal link between integrity and increased performance, quality of life, and value-creation for all entities, and provides access to that causal link.&quot;
According to Muel Kaptein, integrity is not a one-dimensional concept. In his book he presents a multifaceted perspective of integrity. Integrity relates, for example, to compliance to the rules as well as to social expectations, to morality as well as to ethics, and to actions as well as to attitude.

Electronic signals are said to have integrity when there is no corruption of information between one domain and another, such as from a disk drive to a computer display. Such integrity is a fundamental principle of information assurance. Corrupted information is untrustworthy; uncorrupted information is of value.

<text>Framlingham Castle is a castle in the market town of Framlingham, Suffolk, England. An early motte and bailey or ringwork Norman castle was built on the Framlingham site by 1148, but this was destroyed (slighted) by Henry II of England in the aftermath of the Revolt of 1173–1174. Its replacement, constructed by Roger Bigod, the Earl of Norfolk, was unusual for the time in having no central keep, but instead using a curtain wall with thirteen mural towers to defend the centre of the castle. Despite this, the castle was successfully taken by King John in 1216 after a short siege. By the end of the 13th century, Framlingham had become a luxurious home, surrounded by extensive parkland used for hunting.

During the 15th and 16th centuries Framlingham was at the heart of the estates of the powerful Mowbray and Howard families. Two artificial meres were built around the castle, which was expanded in fashionable brick. With a large, wealthy household to maintain, the castle purchased supplies from across England and brought in luxury goods from international markets. Extensive pleasure gardens were built within the castle and older parts redesigned to allow visitors to enjoy the resulting views. By the end of the 16th century, however, the castle fell into disrepair and after the final Howard owner, Theophilus, entered into financial difficulties the castle and the surrounding estates were sold off.

In 1636, Framlingham Castle was given to Pembroke College, Cambridge, as a philanthropic gesture, and remained in its ownership for some three hundred years. In the 17th century, the internal buildings were taken down to make way for the construction of a poor law workhouse within the castle; it was used in this way until 1839, when the facility was closed; the castle was then used as a drill hall and as a county court. In 1913, Pembroke College placed Framlingham into the guardianship of the Commissioner of Works. During the Second World War, Framlingham Castle was used by the British Army as part of the regional defences against a potential German invasion. Today, the Castle is managed by English Heritage and run as a tourist attraction. It is protected under British law as a Grade I listed building and as a scheduled monument.

==History==
===11th–12th centuries===
The population of Framlingham in Suffolk rose sharply after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, as the village turned into a small town of at least 600 inhabitants, surrounded by valuable lands in one of the most prosperous parts of the country. The region was owned by the powerful Hugh d&#x27;Avranches, the Earl of Chester, who granted it in turn to Roger Bigod, the Sheriff of Suffolk. A ringwork or motte and bailey castle was first built in either the 11th or early 12th century in the northern half of the Inner Court of the current castle.

Although the first documentary reference to a castle at Framlingham occurs in 1148, the actual date of its construction is uncertain and three possible options have been suggested by academics. The first possibility is that the castle was built by Roger Bigod in either the late 11th century or around 1100, similar to the founding of Bigod&#x27;s caput at nearby Eye. A second possibility is that Roger&#x27;s son, Hugh Bigod, built it during the years of the Anarchy in the 1140s on the site of an existing manor house; the castle would then be similar to the Bigod fortification at Bungay. A third possibility is that there were in fact two castles: the first being built in the late 11th century and then demolished by Hugh Bigod in the 1160s in order to make way for a newer, larger castle. Historian Magnus Alexander hypothesizes the castle might have been built on top of a set of pre-existing Anglo-Saxon, high prestige buildings, a practice common elsewhere in East Anglia, possibly echoing the arrangement at Castle Acre; this would be most likely if the castle was built in the 11th century.
By the late 12th century the Bigod family had come to dominate Suffolk, holding the title of the Earl of Norfolk and owning Framlingham and three other major castles at Bungay, Walton and Thetford. The first set of stone buildings, including the first hall, were built within the castle during the 1160s. Tensions persisted throughout the period, however, between the Crown and the Bigods. Hugh Bigod was one of a group of dissenting barons during the Anarchy in the reign of King Stephen, and after coming to power Henry II attempted to re-establish royal influence across the region. As part of this effort, Henry confiscated the four Bigod castles from Hugh in 1157, but returned both Framlingham and Bungay in 1165, on payment of a large fine of £666.

Hugh then joined the revolt by Henry&#x27;s sons in 1173. The attempt to overthrow Henry was unsuccessful, and in punishment the King ordered several Bigod castles, including Framlingham, to be destroyed (slighted). The King&#x27;s engineer, Alnoth, destroyed the fortifications and filled in the moat at Framlingham between 1174 and 1176 at a total cost of £16 11s 12d, although he probably shored up, rather than destroyed, the internal stone buildings. It was one of at least twenty castles belonging to the rebels to be slighted in the aftermath of the war.

Hugh&#x27;s son, Roger Bigod, was out of favour with Henry, who initially denied him the family earldom and estates such as Framlingham. Roger finally regained royal favour when Richard I succeeded to the throne in 1189. Roger then set about building a new castle on the Framlingham site – the work was conducted relatively quickly and the castle was certainly complete by 1213. The new castle comprised the Inner Court, defended with 13 mural towers; an adjacent Lower Court with smaller stone walls and towers, and a larger Bailey with timber defences. By this time, a castle-guard system was in place at Framlingham, in which lands were granted to local lords in return for their providing knights or soldiers to guard the castle.

===13th century===

The First Barons&#x27; War began in 1215 between King John and a faction of rebel barons opposed to his rule. Roger Bigod became one of the key opponents to John, having argued over John&#x27;s requirements for military levies. Royal troops plundered the surrounding lands and John&#x27;s army arrived on 12 March 1216, followed by John the next day. With John&#x27;s permission, messages were sent on the 14th from the castle to Roger, who, influenced by the fate of Rochester Castle the previous year, agreed that the garrison of 26 knights, 20 sergeants, 7 crossbowmen and a priest could surrender without a fight. John&#x27;s forces moved on into Essex, and Roger appears to have later regained his castle, and his grandson, another Roger, inherited Framlingham in 1225.

A large park, called the Great Park, was created around the castle; this park is first noted in 1270, although it may have been constructed somewhat earlier. The Great Park enclosed stretching to the north of the castle, and was characterised by possessing bank-and-ditch boundaries, common elsewhere in England but very unusual in Suffolk. The park had a lodge built in it, which later had a recreational garden built around it. Like other parks of the period, the Great Park was not just used for hunting but was exploited for its wider resources: there are records of charcoal-burning being conducted in the park in 1385, for example. Four other smaller parks were also located near the castle, extending the potential for hunting across a long east–west belt of emparked land.

In 1270 Roger Bigod, the 5th Earl, inherited the castle and undertook extensive renovations there whilst living in considerable luxury and style. Although still extremely wealthy, the Bigods were now having to borrow increasing sums from first the Jewish community at Bungay and then, after the expulsion of the Jews, Italian merchants; by the end of the century, Roger was heavily in debt to Edward I as well. As a result, Roger led the baronial opposition to Edward&#x27;s request for additional taxes and support for his French wars. Edward responded by seizing Roger&#x27;s lands and only releasing them on the condition that Roger granted them to the Crown after his death. Roger agreed and Framlingham Castle passed to the Crown on his death in 1306.

By the end of the 13th century a large prison had been built in the castle; this was probably constructed in the north-west corner of the Lower Court, overlooked by the Prison Tower. The prisoners kept there in the medieval period included local poachers and, in the 15th century, religious dissidents, including Lollard supporters.

===14th century===

Edward II gave the castle to his half-brother, Thomas of Brotherton, the Earl of Norfolk. Records show that Framlingham was only partially furnished around this time, although it is unclear if this was because it was in limited use, or because fittings and furnishings were moved from castle to castle with the owner as he traveled, or if the castle was simply being refurnished. The castle complex continued to thrive, however, on Thomas&#x27; death in 1338, the castle passed first to his widow, Mary de Brewes, and then in 1362, into the Ufford family. William de Ufford, 2nd Earl of Suffolk held the castle during the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381, with much of the revolt occurring close to Framlingham. From the Uffords, the castle passed first to Margaret of Brotherton, the self-styled &quot;Countess-Marshall&quot;, and then to Thomas de Mowbray, the Duke of Norfolk. The Mowbrays seem to have used Framlingham Castle as their main seat of power for most of the 15th century.

With as many as 83 people living in the castle at any one time, the castle played a major role in the surrounding economy during the period. Large amounts of food and drink were purchased to support the household – over twelve months in 1385–6, for example, over £1,000 was spent, including the purchase of of ale and 70,321 loaves of bread. By the 14th century the castle was purchasing goods from across western Europe, with wine being imported from France, venison from parks as far away as Northamptonshire and spices from the Far East through London-based merchants. The castle purchased some goods, such as salt, through the annual Stourbridge Fair at nearby Cambridge, then one of the biggest economic events in Europe. Some of this expenditure was supported by the demesne manor attached to the castle, which comprised of land and 5,000 days of serf labour under feudal law. A vineyard was created at the castle in the late 12th century, and a bakery and a horse mill were built in the castle by the 14th century. Surrounding manors also fed in resources to the castle; in twelve months between 1275 and 1276, £434 was received by the castle from the wider region.

Two large lakes, called meres, were formed alongside the castle by damming a local stream. The southern mere, still visible today, had its origins in a smaller, natural lake; once dammed, it covered and had an island with a dovecote built on it. The meres were used for fishing as well as for boating, and would have had extensive aesthetic appeal. It is uncertain exactly when the meres were first built. One theory suggests that the meres were built in the early 13th century, although there is no documentary record of them at least until the 1380s. Another theory is that they were formed in the first half of the 14th century, at around the same time as the Lower Court was constructed. A third possibility is that it was the Howard family who introduced the meres in the late 15th century as part of their modernisation of the castle.

===15th–16th centuries===

In 1476 the castle passed to John Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, who probably began the sequence of improvements to the castle during the Tudor period. Under the Howards the castle was extensively modernised; fashionable brick was used to improve parts of the castle; ornamental chimneys were added; the battlements were reduced in size to exaggerate the apparent height of the walls, and the Howard coat of arms was added to the gatehouse. The Great Chamber was probably built across the Inner Court at this time, linking the Great Hall with the chapel and chambers on the east side of the castle, and by 1524 there were at least 29 different rooms in the castle. Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk commissioned a hanging or tapestry depicting Hercules for the Great Chamber.

The drawbridge outside the gatehouse was replaced with the current permanent bridge between 1524 and 1547; by this time a half-moon defensive structure had been built in stone to defend it. A pleasure garden had been built in the Lower Court by the 16th century, with several ornamental ponds and terraced walkways – the garden would probably have also had fruit trees, herb gardens and fountains. Another pleasure garden was built in the Bailey, and a second bridge built across the moat to allow access to it directly from the Inner Court. The Prison Tower was redesigned to become a viewing gallery for the new formal gardens below.

The Wars of the Roses during the 15th century saw prolonged fighting between the Yorkists and Lancastrians for the control of the English throne. John Howard, a Yorkist supporter, was killed at Bosworth Field in 1485 and in the aftermath his son Thomas, the 2nd Duke, was attainted, forfeiting his and his heirs&#x27; rights to his properties and titles, and placed in the Tower of London. The Lancastrian victor at Bosworth, Henry VII, granted Framlingham Castle to John de Vere, but Thomas finally regained the favour of Henry VIII after fighting at the victory of Flodden in 1513. Framlingham was returned to Thomas and the Duke spent his retirement there; he decorated his table at the castle with gold and silver plate that he had seized from the Scots at Flodden. The castle was expensively decorated in a lavish style during this period, including tapestries, velvet and silver chapel fittings and luxury bedlinen. A hundred suits of armour were stored in the castle and over thirty horses kept in the stables.

The 3rd Duke of Norfolk, also called Thomas, made far less use of the castle, using first Stoke-by-Nayland and then Kenninghall as his principal residence. Thomas was attainted in 1547 out of fears, misplaced but promoted by his rivals led by Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford, that the Howards aspired to the throne; Henry VIII died the day before Thomas was due to be executed at the Tower, and his successor, Mary&#x27;s half-brother Edward VI kept him in the Tower, giving Framlingham to Mary. When Mary contested for the throne against Lady Jane Grey in 1553, she collected her forces at Framlingham Castle before successfully marching on London. Mary, the daughter of Henry VIII and his first wife Catherine of Aragon, was proclaimed the Queen of England here on 19 July 1553. Thomas was released from the Tower by Mary as a reward for his loyalty, but retired to Kenninghall rather than Framlingham. The castle was leased out but when the 4th Duke, another Thomas, was executed for treason by Elizabeth I in 1572 the castle passed back to the Crown.

Repairs to the castle appear to have been minimal from the 1540s onwards, and after Mary left Framlingham the castle went into a fast decline. A survey in 1589 noted that the stonework, timber and brickwork all needed urgent maintenance, at a potential cost of £100. The Great Park was disparked and turned into fields in 1580. As religious laws against Catholics increased, the castle became used as a prison from 1580 onwards; by 1600 the castle prison contained 40 prisoners, Roman Catholic priests and recusants.

===17th–21st centuries===

In 1613 James I returned the castle to Thomas Howard, the Earl of Suffolk, but the castle was now derelict and he chose to live at Audley End House instead. Thomas&#x27;s son, Theophilus Howard, fell heavily into debt and sold the castle, the estate and the former Great Park to Sir Robert Hitcham in 1635 for £14,000; as with several other established parks, such as Eye, Kelsale and Hundon, the Great Park was broken up and turned into separate estates. Hitcham died the following year, leaving the castle and the manor to Pembroke College in Cambridge, with the proviso that the college destroy the internal castle buildings and construct a workhouse on the site instead, operating under the terms of the recently passed Poor Law.

After the collapse of the power of the Howards, the county of Suffolk was controlled by an oligarchy of Protestant gentry by the 17th century and did not play a prominent part in the English Civil War that occurred between 1642 and 1646. Framlingham Castle escaped the slighting that occurred to many other English castles around this time. Hitcham&#x27;s bequest had meanwhile become entangled in the law courts and work did not begin on the workhouse until the late 1650s, by which time the internal buildings of castle were being broken up for the value of their stone; the chapel had been destroyed in this way by 1657.

The workhouse at Framlingham, the Red House, was finally built in the Inner Court and the poor would work there so they were eligible for relief; it proved unsatisfactory and, following the mismanagement of the workhouse funds, the Red House was closed and used as a public house instead. The maintenance of the meres ceased around this time and much of the area returned to meadow. In 1699 another attempt was made to open a poorhouse on the site, resulting in the destruction of the Great Chamber around 1700. This poorhouse failed too, and in 1729 a third attempt was made – the Great Hall was pulled down and the current poorhouse built on its site instead. Opposition to the Poor Law grew, and in 1834 the law was changed to reform the system; the poorhouse on the castle site was closed by 1839, the inhabitants being moved to the workhouse at Wickham Market.
The castle continued to fulfil several other local functions. During the outbreak of plague in 1666, the castle was used as an isolation ward for infected patients, and during the Napoleonic Wars the castle was used to hold the equipment and stores of the local Framlingham Volunteer regiment. Following the closure of the poorhouse, the castle was then used as a drill hall and as a county court, as well as containing the local parish jail and stocks.

In 1913 the Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act was passed by Parliament and Pembroke College took the opportunity to place Framlingham into the guardianship of the Commissioner of Works. The undulating Inner Court was levelled up to its present form as part of the Commissioner&#x27;s maintenance works. During the Second World War, Framlingham was an important defensive location for British forces; at least one concrete pill box was built near to the castle as part of the plans to counter any German invasion, and Nissen huts were erected and a lorry park created in the Bailey.

Today, Framlingham Castle is a scheduled monument and a grade I listed building, managed by English Heritage and run as a tourist attraction, incorporating the Lanman Museum of local history. The castle mere is owned by Framlingham College and run by the Suffolk Wildlife Trust.

==Architecture==
===Design===
Framlingham Castle is located on a bluff overlooking the River Ore, and today is made up of three distinct parts, the Inner Court, the Bailey and the Lower Court, surrounded by the remaining mere and farmland.

The Bailey lies to the south of the walled Inner Court and was originally topped by a wooden palisade and earthworks, of which only the latter survive. The Bailey would have entered from an eastern gate and contained a range of buildings, probably including a Sergeant&#x27;s Chamber, a Knights&#x27; Chamber, the Great Stable, barns and a granary. Modern visitors to the castle enter the complex through the Bailey from the south, which also contains the modern car park for the castle.

The Inner Court, or the Castle, lies beyond the Bailey across the 15th-century bridge that replaced the earlier drawbridge on the site. The gate tower that forms the entrance is a relatively simple design from the 12th century: the fashion for much grander gatehouse designs began shortly afterwards. The 2nd Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Howard, however, had it remodelled in the 16th century, adding his coat of arms and additional ornamentation to the walls. The Inner Court is formed around a stone curtain wall of local flint and septaria stone, high and thick, protected by thirteen square mural towers with open backs, each around high, with corners made of sandstone. A wall-walk runs around the top of the towers and wall.

Originally various buildings were built around the curtain wall. Moving clockwise from the entrance to the Inner Court, the shape of the 12th-century castle chapel can still be made out on the curtain wall. Convention at the time required a chapel to point along a north-east/south-east axis; in order to achieve this, the chapel had to extend out considerably into the bailey, similar to the design at White Castle. The chapel is adjacent to the site of the first stone hall in the castle, built around 1160; in the 16th and 17th centuries the chapel tower was probably also used as a cannon emplacement.

On the far side of the Inner Court is the poorhouse, built on the site of the 12th-century Great Hall. The poorhouse forms three wings: the 17th century Red House to the south, the 18th-century middle wing, and the northern end which incorporates part of the original Great Hall; all of the building was subject to 19th-century renovation work. Five carved, medieval stone heads are set into the poorhouse, taken from the older medieval castle buildings. Next to the poorhouse is the Postern Gate, which leads to the Prison Tower. The Prison Tower, also called the Western Tower, is a significant defensive work, redesigned in the 16th century to feature much larger windows. In the middle of the Inner Court is the castle well, deep.

A number of carved brick chimneys dating from the Tudor period can be seen around the Inner Court, each with a unique design; all but three of these were purely ornamental, however, and historian R. Allen Brown describes them as a &quot;regrettable&quot; addition to the castle from an architectural perspective. Two of the functional Tudor chimneys make use of original mid-12th century flues; these two chimneys are circular in design and are the earliest such surviving structures in England.

One of the castle meres can still be seen to the west of the castle, although in the 16th century there were two lakes, much larger than today, complete with a wharf. This dramatic use of water to reflect the image of the castle is similar to that used at several other castles of the period, including Bredwardine in Herefordshire and Ravensworth Castle in North Yorkshire. Water castles such as Framlingham made greater use of water than was necessary for defence and enhanced the appearance of the castle. The view from the Great Hall in the Inner Court would originally have included the gardens of the Lower Court, and these would have then been framed by the mere and the Great Park beyond. The area around the castle today remains a designed and managed landscape; although the Great Park is now covered by fields, the view still gives a sense of how the castle and landscape was meant to appear to its late medieval owners.

===Interpretation===

The late 12th-century defences at Framlingham Castle have evoked much debate by scholars. One interpretation, put forward for example by historian R. Allen Brown, is that they were relatively advanced for their time and represented a change in contemporary thinking about military defence. Framlingham has no keep, for example – this had been a very popular feature in previous Anglo-Norman castles, but this castle breaks with the tradition, relying on the curtain wall and mural towers instead. The pattern of ground-level arrowslits at Framlingham were similarly innovative for their time, enabling interlocking and flanking fire against attackers. The design of Framlingham&#x27;s defences is similar in many ways to Henry II&#x27;s innovative work at Dover and Orford.

The defensive architecture of the castle also contains various weaknesses. The Inner Court is overlooked by the Bailey, for example; the north of the Inner Court is largely exposed, while the positioning of arrow-slits in the curtain wall ignores much of the castle. The open-backed mural towers, whilst cheaper to build than closed towers, could not have been easily defended once the wall had been penetrated, and because they projected only a little way from the wall, they provided very little options for enfilading fire against attackers close to the walls. These weaknesses have been used by historians such as Robert Liddiard to argue that the architecture of castles such as Framlingham were influenced by cultural and political requirements as well as purely military intent.

Focusing on the cultural and political use of the architecture at Framlingham, historian D. Plowman has put forward a revisionist interpretation of the castle&#x27;s architecture in the late medieval period. Plowman suggests that the castle was intended to be entered from the north end of the Lower Court, passing through the ornamental gardens, with travellers then entering through the gate by the Prison Tower – in this interpretation, more of a barbican than a tower – and then up into the Inner Court. This would have provided high status visitors with dramatic views of the castle, reinforcing the political prestige of the owners. Historian Magnus Alexander disputes the practicality of this arrangement, although agrees that the route would have been more practical for hunting parties proceeding to the local parklands.

<doc id="127861" wikidata="Q2028067" url="?curid=127861" title="Nags Head, North Carolina">
<text>Nags Head is a town in Dare County, North Carolina, United States. It is a busy vacation spot because of its beaches and sand dunes of Jockey&#x27;s Ridge. The population was 3,146 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Early maps of the area show Nags Head as a promontory of land characterized by high sand dunes visible from miles at sea. The origin of the town&#x27;s name is obscure but it is likely to have been named after any one of the places called Nag&#x27;s Head on the English coast.

A folkloric explanation claims that mules or horses () would have lights hung on their heads by nefarious wreckers in order to trick ships into running aground and then loot the ships of their valuables. The town&#x27;s emblem depicts one such equine accomplice from the tale.

Around 1830, Nags Head became known as a resort area. This direction was accelerated in 1855 when Dr. W. G. Pool bought 50 acres of oceanfront land which he separated into plots and sold to friends, increasing the number of homes in the area.

Jockey&#x27;s Ridge is the last vestige of the sand dunes seen by the first explorers, as the area is now highly developed. The town incorporated in 1961.

=== Energy and design improvements ===
In May 2021, Nags Head was one of 11 communities (along with nearby Ocracoke, North Carolina) chosen by the United States Department of Energy to participate in the Energy Transitions Initiative Partnership Project, a program to provide federal aid for remote communities to modernize their electric infrastructure and resiliency through natural disasters and outages. Nags Head&#x27;s grant is used to secure 48–72 hours of backup energy for emergency services due to the community&#x27;s vulnerability to severe weather and rising sea levels and to investigate renewable and energy efficiency options. According to Nag&#x27;s Head&#x27;s Director of Planning and Development Michael Zehner, the project will take 12–18 months to complete and the town will receive assistance from National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Sandia National Laboratories.

Nags Head received a separate grant from the North Carolina Chapter of the American Institute of Architects to receive technical assistance in developing better building design practices for energy and water efficiency, a project with an expected completion in early 2022.

==Geography==
Nags Head is located at (35.932004, -75.615085).

==Landmarks and attractions==
Located in Nags Head is the largest sand dune on the East Coast at Jockey&#x27;s Ridge State Park. The sand dune has migrated over the years from the energy of coastal winds and has buried a miniature golf course along the way. Jockey&#x27;s Ridge has been popular with hang-gliders since the advent of the sport, and is home to the world&#x27;s largest hang gliding school. Kite flyers are also frequent visitors. The park&#x27;s visitor center includes an informative museum with exhibits on sand, weather, and local fauna. The diversity of wildlife may change with seasonal migrations and includes bird species, foxes, mice, squirrels, occasional deer and rabbits.

One of the most exciting features of the Ridge is its capriciousness. Annual visitors find that ephemeral pools can spring up, and the sand can shift, making for a fresh experience every time. From the top of the Ridge, the ocean as well as the sound can be seen. Jockey&#x27;s Ridge has a sound beach on the Roanoke Sound side where visitors may swim.

The Nags Head Woods Ecological Preserve is and lies North of Jockey&#x27;s Ridge and east of Roanoke Sound. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1974.

As in any other beach town, the ocean and shoreline are the major attractions, providing beaches for swimming, sunbathing, and a variety of water sports. A series of historic cottages overlook the beach in sections. There are three piers popular for fishing: Nags Head Pier, Jennette&#x27;s Pier (severely damaged by Hurricane Isabel in 2003, bought and renovated by the North Carolina Aquariums, reopened in May 2011), and Outer Banks Pier. The town also features miniature golf courses and small amusement centers with go-karts and bumper cars for family entertainment.

<doc id="127863" wikidata="Q2025239" url="?curid=127863" title="Wanchese, North Carolina">
<text>Wanchese ( ) is a census-designated place (CDP) on Roanoke Island in Dare County, North Carolina, United States. It was named after Wanchese, the last known ruler of the Roanoke Native American tribe encountered by English colonists in the sixteenth century. The population was 1,642 at the 2010 census. Today, Wanchese is the center of commercial fishing and boatbuilding on the Outer Banks.

The residents of Wanchese are governed by the Dare County Board of Commissioners. Wanchese is part of District 1, along with Manteo, Roanoke Island and Manns Harbor.

==Geography==
Wanchese is located at , and on the southern end of Roanoke Island.

According to the United States, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and (14.26%) is water.

==History==
&quot;Also see: History of Roanoke Island&quot;

Archeological evidence shows that Wanchese was the site of the first fishing village on Roanoke Island. Indigenous people inhabited the area 1500 years ago, and their various cultures used this site for fishing for 1100 years. They also collected oysters and shellfish from nearby beds in the Sound.

What is called the Tillett Site (after the last owners) had been occupied originally when it was still part of the mainland, during the entire Archaic Period (8000-1000 BC). After the sea levels rose and it became an island, the saline conditions of the Sound became established, giving rise to the later indigenous fishing culture, including that of the historic Roanoke tribe.

Three later periods of occupation were identified: 
* Mount Pleasant component, beginning around 400 and ending around 800;
* Colington component, the prehistoric manifestation of the Carolina Algonkian culture, from 800 to 1650; and
* Historic period component, related mostly to the Green family use of the site as a farmstead from c. 1884 to 1910/20. There was also fishing in this area.

During the first two periods, the Tillett site was a seasonal settlement. The Roanoke came to it from the mainland to fish and collect shellfish. At the time of English exploration, the Algonquian-speaking Roanoke tribe used the site for seasonal fishing. Their main town was on the western shore of Croatan Sound.

After permanent English colonization in the 1650s, the site continued to be used for fishing by the Anglo-Americans. During the 19th century Wanchese had the only light-house on Roanoke Island, called Marshes Light, which has since been reconstructed in Manteo. In the 1980s, it was to be redeveloped for a major commercial fishing port and seafood processing facility.

<doc id="127865" wikidata="Q181370" url="?curid=127865" title="Lexington, North Carolina">
<text>Lexington is the county seat of Davidson County, North Carolina, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town had a population of 19,632. It is located in central North Carolina, south of Winston-Salem. Major highways include I-85, I-85B, U.S. Route 29, U.S. Route 70, U.S. Route 52 / I-285 and U.S. Route 64. Lexington is part of the Piedmont Triad region of the state.

Lexington has been noted as one of America&#x27;s top four best cities for barbecue by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. The City calls itself the &quot;Barbecue Capital of the World&quot;.

Lexington, Thomasville, and the rural areas surrounding them are slowly developing as residential bedroom communities for nearby cities such as Winston-Salem, Greensboro, High Point and, to a lesser extent, Charlotte and its northeastern suburbs.

==History==
The Lexington area was at least sparsely settled by Europeans in 1775. The settlers named their community in honor of Lexington, Massachusetts, the site of the first skirmish of the American Revolutionary War. Lexington was incorporated as a city in 1828. Silver Hill Mine, located a few miles south of Lexington, opened in 1838, and was the first operating silver mine in the country.

The oldest surviving house in Lexington is The Homestead, built by Dr. William Rainey Holt (1798–1868), a physician born in what is today Alamance County. &quot;The Homestead&quot; has windows, sidelights and other Palladian details characteristic of the pattern books of architect Asher Benjamin.

In addition to The Homestead, the Erlanger Mill Village Historic District, First Reformed Church, Grace Episcopal Church, Grimes Brothers Mill, Grimes School, Hedrick&#x27;s Grove Reformed Church, Junior Order United American Mechanics National Orphans Home, Lexington Memorial Hospital, Lexington Residential Historic District, Old Davidson County Courthouse, Pilgrim Reformed Church Cemetery, Henry Shoaf Farm, Uptown Lexington Historic District, and John Henry Welborn House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Business and industry==
In the twentieth century until the late 1990s, Lexington&#x27;s economy was mainly based on textile and furniture manufacturing. Since then, most local manufacturers have moved their production facilities to Asia and Mexico as a way to reduce costs and remain competitive in a global market. This caused the closure of most textile and furniture factories and contributed to economic difficulties for a community that was heavily dependent on these two industries for employment. The Lexington industrial portfolio has since diversified.

In 2023, Siemens Mobility announced that Lexington will be the home of their new railcar manufacturing facility. Siemens Mobility broke ground on the 220 acre facility in August, 2023 with construction estimated to be completed in Fall, 2024 with manufacturing to begin by October, 2024. This facility is going to manufacture railcar&#x27;s as well as provide railcar and locomotive overhauling services on the east coast.

Other large employers include:
*Halyard Health
*Jeld-Wen
*PPG Industries
*Vitacost
*Siemens Mobility

==Culture==
===Barbecue===
Lexington calls itself the &quot;Barbecue Capital of the World&quot;. Since 1984, the city has hosted the Lexington Barbecue Festival, one of the largest street festivals in North Carolina. As of 2003, the city has over twenty barbecue restaurants, an average of more than one per thousand residents. In 2012, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Lexington #4 on its list of the best cities for barbecue.

Lexington-style barbecue is made with pork shoulder cooked slowly over a hardwood fire, usually hickory. It is basted in a sauce (called &quot;dip&quot; locally) made with vinegar, ketchup, water, salt, pepper and other spices. The ingredients vary from restaurant to restaurant, with each restaurant&#x27;s recipe being a closely guarded secret. While each is vinegar-based, the taste varies widely from tangy to slightly sweet or spicy.

The most distinguishing feature of the &quot;Lexington Barbecue Sandwich&quot; is the inclusion of red slaw (sometimes called &quot;barbecue slaw&quot;). Red slaw is a combination of cabbage, vinegar, ketchup and crushed/ground black pepper; it is distinguishable from coleslaw because it contains no mayonnaise. Many Lexingtonians (and visitors) consider red slaw a staple for a quality barbecue experience. Red slaw is commonly served as a side dish with barbecue, grilled poultry and other meats, and on hot dogs as a relish.

===Pigs in the City===

&quot;Pigs in the City&quot; is a public art initiative coordinated by Uptown Lexington, Inc., a non-profit organization created to revitalize the downtown (locally called &quot;uptown&quot;) area of Lexington. People paid commissions to artists to decorate life-sized sculptures of pigs, which were installed throughout the city. Pigs in the City began in 2003, and the event drew more than 40,000 visitors from all over the state in its first year. The cost to &quot;sponsor&quot; one of the 20 pigs on display was $1,000 during the first exhibition, which paid for the initiative. The event ran from 2003–2005, and 2008–2009. In 2019, it was announced that Pigs in the City will return in 2020.

===High Rock Lake===
The second largest lake in North Carolina, High Rock Lake is located a few miles south of Lexington. Its water surface covers , and it has of shoreline. It begins at the confluence of the Yadkin and South Yadkin rivers.

High Rock Lake has long been considered one of the best fishing lakes of North Carolina. It is the site of the Bassmaster Tournaments, including the Bassmaster Classic in 1994, 1995, 1997 and 2007 and frequently is used for other angling competitions. The lake is stocked with channel, blue, and flathead catfish, plus crappie and several different sunfish, such as bluegill, shellcracker and others. Striper and their hybrids, as well as white bass, are also abundant.

The lake is best known for its quantity and quality of largemouth bass, which attract anglers from all over the United States. This is likely due to the relatively shallow nature of the lake and the favorable habitat for the bass.

==Geography==

Lexington is located in the Piedmont Triad region. Lexington is northeast of High Rock Lake, part of the Yadkin-Pee Dee chain of lakes in central North Carolina.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Interstate 85 Business passes north and west of the center of Lexington, and Interstate 85 passes to the south. The highways merge at the southwest end of the city. Additionally, four U.S. highways, U.S. Route 29, 64, 52, Interstate 285 (co-signed with US 52) and 70, and state highways 8 and 47 intersect in the city.

===Climate===
Thunderstorms are common during the spring and summer months, including some severe storms. Located in central North Carolina, between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mid-Atlantic coast, Lexington has a humid subtropical climate, with moderate temperatures during spring and autumn and warm to hot summers. Winters are relatively mild and wet with highs typically in the 40s to 50s and overnight lows averaging just below freezing.

<text>Beulaville is a town located in Duplin County, North Carolina, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 1,116. The community lies within the Limestone Creek Township.

==History==

===Native American Presence===

The earliest Native Americans thought to have lived in the area were the Joara (whose settlements date back to AD 1000), based out of present-day Burke County. The Joara were the chiefdom of the Mississippian culture. Immediately prior to European colonization in the early 18th century, the coastal plain of North Carolina was home to many distinct Native American tribes: the Coree, Coharie, several small Neusiok communities, and the Tuscarora. This latter tribe gradually became the most dominant in the region as smaller tribes were either exterminated by Europeans or peacefully assimilated into the Tuscarora for collective security. By the time of permanent European settlement, the Tuscarora were utilizing the heavily forested areas of eastern Duplin County as a hunting ground.

Native American burial mounds are numerous in Duplin County, in the rural areas surrounding Beulaville especially. There are four sizable mounds within a ten-mile radius of the town, the two largest being in the vicinity of Hallsville and Sarecta. Combined, these mounds contain roughly one hundred bodies.

===European Settlement===

The arrival of the Palatines at New Bern and the ensuing wave of English and Welsh settlers sparked a conflict known as the Tuscarora War (1710–1715). With the elimination of the last Tuscarora stronghold at Fort Neoheroka and subsequent exodus of the remainder of the tribe to New York (they became the sixth nation of the Iroquois Confederacy), the interior of the coastal plain was made available for European settlement. Many of the original European settlers of what is now Beulaville arrived from Beaufort, Craven, Jones, and Onslow counties.

In 1736, Duplin County (then upper New Hanover County) was the destination of several hundred Ulster Scots (Scotch-Irish) and a handful of Swiss Protestants. They settled on a plot of land, between the Northeast Cape Fear River and Black River, obtained from the Crown by Henry McCulloh of London. Their first settlements were Soracta (Sarecta) on the Northeast Cape Fear, an area at the lower end of Goshen Swamp (then called Woodward&#x27;s Chase), and the grove where the Duplin County Courthouse now stands. According to census records, several families of Sarecta and the settlement at the south end of Goshen Swamp had gravitated to the crossroads of what would become Beulaville by the middle of the nineteenth century.

Beulaville proper was founded as &quot;Snatchet&quot; in 1873 out of necessity for a trading center for nearby farmers and those in the business of logging and turpentine production. Also colloquially referred to as &quot;Tearshirt&quot; by locals, the town was once notorious for alcoholism and frequent street brawls. Indeed, the manufacture and distribution of corn liquor remained a steady source of income for many families well into the 20th century. Upon demolition of a prominent downtown building (which had formerly served as a soda shop in the 1950s) to make way for a McDonald&#x27;s, a moonshine still and several barrels of the drink were uncovered in the basement.

The constructed a railway from Kinston to Pink Hill around 1900. In response, residents of Limestone Creek Township spent $15,000 to lobby for the creation of the &quot;Duplin County Railroad&quot; in 1916, extending the Kinston line through Beulaville and Chinquapin. The rail, which ran alongside present-day Railroad Street, has since been destroyed. The post office of Snatchet was officially re-designated &quot;Beulaville&quot; in 1910, and the town was incorporated five years later. The town&#x27;s name is derived from the Beulah Baptist Church (now the Beulaville Baptist Church). Beulaville is the most recent town to be incorporated in Duplin County.
==Education==
In 1839, the county passed a tax for the creation of a public school system. Several decades later (sometime around 1870) the first public school in what would become Beulaville was constructed. The facility - which was no more than a small wood cabin - employed only one teacher. By 1901, however, four teachers were working out of the schoolhouse. In 1906, property was purchased for a new school. A new two-story wooden building was erected and first used in the school year of 1917–1918; the enrollment for that year was nearly 200. Three additions – the auditorium, gym, and band building – were added in 1923, and additional tracts of land were purchased for the school between 1933 and 1950. On November 6, 1945, the school&#x27;s main building burned to the ground. Only the John Hargett Gymnasium and auditorium were spared. School continued in these buildings and the teacherage located next door until the fall of 1947, when the elementary school building was rebuilt and a new high school building had been constructed. Potter&#x27;s Hill Elementary merged with Beulaville in 1960, and integration was implemented shortly after.

Beulaville is home to one elementary/middle school (Beulaville Elementary) and one secondary school (East Duplin High School). The mascot for both schools, as well as nearby B. F. Grady, is the panther, referring to the eastern cougar which once roamed the swamps and forests of eastern North Carolina. East Duplin High School was built in 1963 and consolidates the elementary schools of Beulaville, B. F. Grady, and Chinquapin.

==Geography==
Beulaville is located on the coastal plain of North Carolina in Duplin County. It is situated at above sea level, with only minimal changes in topography. Limestone Creek, a small body of water that runs into the Northeast Cape Fear River at Hallsville, borders the western boundary of town. Beulaville is southeast of Raleigh and south of Washington, D.C.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.81% of the population.

There were 442 households, out of which 26.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 43.7% were married couples living together, 15.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 38.0% were non-families. 35.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 16.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.24 and the average family size was 2.89.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 23.1% under the age of 18, 6.2% from 18 to 24, 21.3% from 25 to 44, 25.7% from 45 to 64, and 23.7% who were 65 years of age or older.

About 15.4% of families and 18.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 24.0% of those under age 18 and 11.7% of those age 65 or over.

==Recreation==
Situated east of the meandering Northeast Cape Fear River, Beulaville offers much in the way of outdoor recreation. There are two boat landings on the Northeast Cape Fear River within a radius of town. The communal landing at Hallsville, which had, for centuries, been used by locals for activities ranging from baptisms to bonfires, has been closed off to the public. The other landing is located west of Beulaville, off Highway 24, halfway to Kenansville. Several golf courses can also be found near Beulaville and in the greater Duplin area.

Within the town limits there are three public parks providing a variety of recreational needs, to include the William Ray Humphrey Athletic Park, a ballpark converted from the former elementary school&#x27;s recreational fields. The park, located behind the Beulaville Municipal Complex, boasts three baseball fields, two tennis courts, two outdoor basketball courts, and the John Hargett indoor gymnasium.

 north of Beulaville on Highway 111, the 167-acre Cabin Lake County Park attracts many locals and visitors for year-round camping, canoeing, and hiking. Additionally, the Tarkil Branch Farm Museum at Cedar Fork, southeast of Beulaville, features a genuine 1830s homestead complete with over 850 artifacts; the operation is situated on a 375-acre working farm.

==Economy==
The manufacture of naval stores and lumbering were the first marketable enterprises for the families inhabiting what is now Limestone Creek Township. These commodities were ferried down the Northeast Cape Fear River (which, in the early nineteenth century, had been made navigable) to Wilmington. As demand for naval stores fell, however, the cultivation of corn and, most importantly, tobacco moved to the forefront. As many of the small-scale tobacco growers dropped out of the market due to tobacco buyouts, an economic stimulus was needed; it came in the form of hogs. Agriculture is still the economic lifeline of Beulaville (Duplin now boasts the second highest hog-to-human ratio in the country), though service industries and manufacturing jobs are gradually supplanting this tradition. Viticulture has noticeably increased throughout the area over the past decade as well. The North Carolina Global TransPark, a multi-modal industrial air terminal, is located to the north in Kinston and is a perk for industry to locate to the area. Beulaville has also benefited from its proximity to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune to the southeast in both traffic volume on NC 24 en route to Interstate 40 and in job opportunities for citizens.

<text>Princeville is a town in Edgecombe County, North Carolina, United States established by freed slaves after the Civil War. It was established in 1865 and known as Freedom Hill. It was incorporated in 1885 as Princeville, the first independently governed African American community chartered in the United States.

Princeville is part of the Rocky Mount, North Carolina Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 1,254 residents. The town is on the opposite bank of the Tar River from Tarboro. The city of Rocky Mount is to the west.

==History==
As the American Civil War reached its conclusion, formerly enslaved African Americans sought refuge at a temporary Union encampment south of Tarboro, North Carolina along the Tar River. With the assistance of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, these inhabitants developed their own makeshift settlement at the site and chose the name Freedom Hill in recognition of a small raised area where a Union soldier first announced the Emancipation Proclamation. The land on which they stayed was owned by two white planters, John Lloyd and Lafayette Dancy. There is no evidence that the two ever attempted to remove the freedmen from their properties, probably owing to the initial presence of federal troops and the poor quality of the land, which frequently flooded. The community suffered heavily from poverty during its early years, receiving limited federal aid until the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau withdrew from North Carolina in 1869. During the Reconstruction era, inheritors of Lloyd&#x27;s parcel sold their property to planter Henry W. Shaw. Shaw began selling plots to the freedmen for low prices, though some residents continued to live as squatters. Black holdings grew near the Tar River bridge and more homes were built.

Unlike most freedmen&#x27;s towns in the Southern United States and in spite of its location in an agricultural region, Freedom Hill developed as a community with a workforce dominated by nonagricultural labor. The 1880 U.S. census recorded 379 inhabitants of whom only 12 were farmers and 43 were farmhands, with the remainder working in various trades including day laboring, laundering, seamstressing, carpentry, and blacksmithing. By that point community had also several white residents, most of whom were sharecroppers. Little is known about the white population of the town, though evidence indicates whites and blacks lived in separate areas. In 1883 a school was established in the community. Several churches were also established, though available dates on their creation are not exact. Local black residents were also, like their black contemporaries elsewhere in the state, politically active throughout the remainder of the 19th century, with local Robert S. Taylor serving as an Edgecombe County justice of the peace and William P. Mabson serving as a state legislator.

Gradually both local blacks and the white population in Edgecombe County came to support the notion of incorporating the community. The black residents of Freedom Hill sought the advantages of local political involvement and self-governance, while whites in the county preferred having blacks available nearby as a labor force but socially segregated from their communities. After several petitions from Edgecombe County residents, in February 1885 the North Carolina General Assembly incorporated the community as the town of Princeville, named in honor of local carpenter Turner Prince. The incorporating act provided for the town to elect its own government and scheduled their election in May 1886. In the years following incorporation the town experienced increased commercial development as more locals established their own businesses. Most of the town&#x27;s political leaders emerged from the mercantile class.

Princeville faced challenges throughout the Jim Crow era. In the opening years of the 20th century, white business owners launched unsuccessful attempts to either dissolve or seize control of the town. By the end of World War I, more than half of the town&#x27;s inhabitants moved to northern cities as part of the Great Migration seeking economic opportunities and an escape from white supremacy. In 1967 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built a levee in the town to protect it from flooding. In February 1997 the North Carolina Local Government Commission assumed control over the town&#x27;s finances, the first time it had ever taken over the finances of a municipality.

The town also suffered continuing difficulties due to its low elevation and adjacency to the Tar River. Princeville experienced severe flooding in September 1999 when Cape Verde-type Hurricane Floyd pulled coffins from the cemetery and raised water levels to just below the height of rooftops and church steeples. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency offered to buy out all residences in the town, but municipal officials rejected the offer. In October 2016, Category 5 Atlantic Hurricane Matthew struck the town with similarly devastating results leaving residents with a decision between rebuilding and moving elsewhere. As the town&#x27;s population declined in wake of the natural disasters, its tax base shrunk and the county government assumed various responsibilities from the municipality, including authority over tax collection, policing, and water and sewer services. In 2020, the Army Corps of Engineers announced $39.6 million in funding for a levee project to protect Princeville from future storms.

== Tourism ==
As the first town chartered by blacks in the United States, Princeville is home to several locations of historical interest. In 1999, students from North Carolina State University created a mobile museum for exhibits showcasing the town&#x27;s unique heritage. Historic buildings include the Abraham Wooten House, the Mount Zion Primitive Baptist Church, and the Princeville School, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

== Financial difficulties ==
In a rare move, the State Treasurer&#x27;s Office took control of the books for financially strapped Princeville in 1997 and July 2012. In September 2021, a comprehensive town plan was adopted with emphases on resiliency, self-sufficiency, and economic growth.

<text>Tarboro is a town located in Edgecombe County, North Carolina, United States. It is part of the Rocky Mount Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2020 census, the town had a population of 10,721. It is the county seat of Edgecombe County. The town is on the opposite bank of the Tar River from Princeville. It is also part of the Rocky Mount-Wilson-Roanoke Rapids CSA. Tarboro is located near the western edge of North Carolina&#x27;s coastal plain. It has many historical churches, some dating from as early as 1742.

Tarboro was chartered by British colonists in 1760. Located in a bend of the Tar River, it was an important river port, the head of navigation on the Tar River just east of the fall line of the Piedmont. As early as the 1730s, a small community developed around this natural asset. With different businesses, a church, a jail, two warehouses, a courthouse, a few well built private houses, together with a score of &quot;plain and cheap&quot; houses, made a bustling village by the late 1700s.

== History ==
Created in 1760, Tarboro is the ninth-oldest incorporated town in North Carolina. Situated on the Tar River at the fall line in the Piedmont, the town served the area as an important colonial river port. It was a thriving trade center until the Civil War.

Scholars believe that the area around Tarboro was settled by 1733, but Edward Moseley&#x27;s map of that year indicates only Tuscarora Native Americans, an Iroquoian-language speaking group. By 1750, the area was widely known as &quot;Tawboro&quot;, a name attributed to &quot;Taw&quot;, the Tuscaroran word for &quot;river of health&quot;.

&quot;Tarrburg&quot;, as the town was called on maps of 1770–75, was chartered November 30, 1760, as &quot;Tarborough&quot; by the General Assembly. In September of the same year, Joseph and Ester Howell deeded of their property to the Reverend James Moir, Lawrence Toole (a merchant), Captains Aquilla Sugg and Elisha Battle, and Benjamin Hart, Esquire, for five shillings and one peppercorn. As commissioners, these men laid out a town with lots not exceeding and streets not wider than , with 12 lots and a &quot;common&quot; set aside for public use. Lots were to be sold for two pounds, with the proceeds to be turned over to the Howells; however, full payment was not received for all of the 109 lots sold, and some were not sold for the 40 shillings price.

After Halifax County was separated from Edgecombe County in 1758–59, the original county seat of Enfield was within Halifax.

Tarboro officially was designated as the county seat of Edgecombe in 1764. For four years the county government had met in Redman&#x27;s Field. The North Carolina State Legislature met here once in 1787 and again in 1987. President George Washington is known to have slept in Tarboro during a visit on his 1791 Southern tour. He is noted to have said of the town that it was &quot;as good a salute as could be given with one piece of artillery.&quot;

According to the book, &quot;Edgecombe County: Twelve North Carolina Counties in 1810–11&quot;, by Jeremiah Battle, the following is an 1810 account of the town:

&quot;Tarboro, the only town in the county, is handsomely situated on the south-west bank of Tar River, just above the mouth of Hendrick&#x27;s Creek, in lat. 35 deg. 45 min. It is forty-eight miles west by north from Washington, thirty-six south of Halifax, eighty-three northwest of Newbern, and sixty-eight east of Raleigh. It was laid off into lots in the year 1760. The streets are seventy-two feet wide, and cross each other at right angles, leaving squares of each. These squares being divided into lots of , makes every lot front or face two streets.

&quot;There are about fifty private houses in it; and generally from fifteen to twenty stores, a church, a jail, two warehouses, and a large Court House, which in the year 1785 was used for the sitting of the State Legislature. There are several good springs adjacent to the town, but for culinary purposes almost every person or family has a well; and some of these wells afford good water the greater part of the year. This place affords good encouragement to all industrious persons, particularly merchants of almost every description. Sixty or seventy merchants have had full employment here at one time. But such of them as have emigrated to this place have too soon found themselves in prosperous situations, and have betaken themselves to idleness and dissipation.&quot;

Due to the development of cotton plantations in the uplands, which were worked by slave labor in the antebellum years, by the 1870s Halifax and Edgecombe counties were among several in northeast North Carolina with majority-black populations. Local plantations include Adelphia Plantation. Before being disfranchised by the passage in 1899 of a new state constitutions, black citizens elected four African Americans to the U.S. Congress from North Carolina&#x27;s 2nd congressional district in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. They also elected many blacks to local offices. Congressman George Henry White, a successful attorney, lived in Tarboro. After passage of the disfranchising constitution, he left the state, stating it was impossible for a black to be a man there. He became a successful banker in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 provided for oversight and enforcement of the constitutional rights of African Americans to vote. They have since been able to participate again in political life in North Carolina.

=== Hurricane Floyd ===
Hurricane Floyd was a very powerful Cape Verde-type hurricane that struck the east coast of the United States in 1999. It was the sixth named storm, fourth hurricane, and third major hurricane in the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. With its approach, officials ordered the third largest evacuation in US history (behind Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Rita, respectively), and 2.6 million coastal residents of five states were ordered from their homes. The hurricane formed off the coast of Africa and lasted from September 7 to 19, peaking in strength as a very strong Category 4 hurricane—just 2 mph short of the highest possible rating on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.

Flooding in Tarboro occurred mostly in areas around the Tar River, which exceeded 500-year flood levels along its lower stretches; it crested above flood stage. The Tar River surrounds about half of Tarboro as both the North end and Southern ends of the city have developed along it. Flooding began upstream in Rocky Mount, where up to 30% of the city was underwater for several days. In Tarboro, much of the downtown became flooded by several feet of water. Nearby, the town of Princeville was largely destroyed when the waters of the Tar poured over the town&#x27;s levee, covering the town with more than of floodwater for ten days. Part of the Tarboro and Princeville city limits are defined by the Tar River.

== Tarboro Historic District ==
Recognized by the National Park Service in 1977, the 45-block Tarboro Historic District has more than 300 contributing structures, from residences to historic churches to original 19th-century storefronts along Tarboro&#x27;s Main Street. The gateway to the Tarboro Historic District is the Tarboro Town Common, a park that has a canopy of tall oaks. War memorials are installed here. The Town Common originally surrounded the town and is the second-oldest legislated town common in the country. Initially the location for common grazing of livestock, community gatherings and military drills, the Town Common is the only remaining original common on the East Coast outside of Boston.
Within the historic district is the Blount-Bridgers House, an 1808 Federal-style mansion that is operated as a museum: it holds several important document collections and works by Hobson Pittman, a nationally recognized artist and Tarboro native. Opened to the public in 1982, the Blount-Bridgers House serves as the town&#x27;s art and civic center. A self-guided Historic District National Recreation Trail, beginning at the Blount-Bridgers House, leads visitors through the scenic older neighborhoods of the town. The district includes five 18th-century homes, with the oldest being the Archibald White house (ca. 1785) located on the corner of Church and Trade streets. The district has more than two dozen antebellum homes built from 1800 to 1860. The largest section is late 19th-and early 20th-century and includes Victorian, Second Empire, Neo-classical revival, and Arts and Crafts-style homes. The town&#x27;s walkable downtown is recognized by the National Trust for Historic Preservation&#x27;s Main Street Program.

Also within the historic district, at the cross of North Church Street and Albemarle Avenue, is the Tarboro-Edgecombe Farmers&#x27; Market. The market operates on Tuesdays and Fridays from 7 am to 10 am, and Saturdays from 8 am to 11 am. A variety of events, including the Tarboro Common Arts Festival and the Blueberry Day, are celebrated in downtown.

<doc id="127886" wikidata="Q831168" url="?curid=127886" title="Bethania, North Carolina">
<text>Bethania is the oldest municipality in Forsyth County, North Carolina, United States, and was most recently incorporated in 1995, upon the reactivation of the original 1838/1839 town charter. In 2009, Bethania celebrated the 250th anniversary of its establishment in 1759. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 341.

==History==
The first planned Moravian settlement in North Carolina, Bethania exists as the only remaining independent, continuously active Moravian village in the southern United States, and is the only known existing Germanic-type linear agricultural village in the South. The Bethania National Historic Landmark district is the largest such district in Forsyth County. Bethania and its 18th- and 19th-century properties are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Bethania was founded June 12, 1759, by the Moravian Brethren of Wachovia as a congregational, agricultural, and trades community. Bethania was the first planned Moravian settlement in Wachovia, and members of a &quot;Society&quot;, under the care of the Bethania congregation, were permitted to reside in the village after July 1759. Today, Bethania&#x27;s eighteenth-century German-type linear agricultural village design remains visible and intact, and most town lots and roadways have remained in continuous use since 1759. The name &quot;Bethania&quot; is the German form of &quot;Bethany&quot;, the name of a village near Jerusalem recorded in the New Testament as the home of Mary, Martha and Lazarus, as well as that of Simon the Leper.

During the Revolutionary War, this town was for a time considered by locals not as &quot;Bethania&quot; but as &quot;HauserTown&quot; (pronounced Hooz-er) because of the significance of families with the last name Hauser that resided there. Mary Hauser was one of the first people buried in Bethania&#x27;s God&#x27;s Acre cemetery.

In March 2007, the town of Bethania opened a visitor center and museum, Historic Bethania, to welcome friends and guests, and to promote education and cultural resource preservation in the community. The center&#x27;s facilities include a relocated and restored Moravian farmstead home, the Wolff-Moser House, dating to ca. 1792, one of the earliest known surviving rural Moravian farmstead homes in North America. The Wolff-Moser House can be visited by the public during the center&#x27;s open hours. The visitor center, located at 5393 Ham Horton Lane, at the intersection of Main Street and Bethania Road, also serves as an orientation center for those wishing to explore the Bethania National Historic Landmark District.

<text>Bungay Castle is a Grade I listed building in the town of Bungay, Suffolk.

==History==
The site was originally a Norman castle built by Roger Bigod in about 1100 to take advantage of the natural protection provided by a curve in the River Waveney. Roger&#x27;s son Hugh was a prominent player in the civil war period known as the Anarchy (1138–1154), and his loyalty was called into question during the early years of the reign of Henry II. Henry confiscated Bungay but in 1164 he returned it to Bigod, who built a large square Norman keep on the site in 1165. It is not recorded how much it cost to build the keep, but the archaeologist Hugh Braun, who led the excavations at the castle in the 1930s, estimated that it would have cost around £1,400 (). Bigod was on the losing side in the revolt of 1173–1174, and Bungay was besieged, mined and ultimately slighted by royal forces. According to the historian Sidney Painter, it was one of at least 21 castles demolished on Henry II&#x27;s instructions.

The site was subsequently restored yet again to the Bigod family and was further developed in 1294 by Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk, who probably built the massive gate towers on the site. He fell out with Edward I and after his death the castle reverted to the Crown, falling into disrepair and ruin. In 1483 it was re-acquired by the Dukes of Norfolk, who retained ownership until the 20th century, except for a short period in the late 18th century. In 1766 the site was sold to Robert Mickleborough, who quarried the keep and curtain walls for road-building materials. Later, in the early 1790s, it was purchased by Daniel Bonhôte, a local solicitor, but was sold back to the Dukes of Norfolk in about 1800.

Other than the removal in 1841 of dwellings that had been built on the site, little or no repairs were undertaken for several centuries.

==Restoration and preservation==
The castle&#x27;s curtain walls and the twin towers of the gatehouse remain today, as well as a fragment of the keep. Restoration work under the supervision of Hugh Braun began in 1934, following excavations by the amateur archaeologist Leonard Cane. In 1987 the castle was given to the town of Bungay by the 17th Duke of Norfolk and is now owned by the Bungay Castle Trust. It was scheduled in 1915, one of the first sites to be protected under the Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act of 1913, and was subsequently listed as a Grade I monument in 1949.

The castle is currently closed (Summer 2024) until further notice and is covered in scaffolding as repairs are made. It does not have a reopening time.

==The castle in fiction==
Bungay Castle was the setting for the eponymous novel by Elizabeth Bonhôte, &quot;Bungay Castle&quot;, a Gothic romance published in 1796, a few years after her husband Daniel had acquired the site.

He supplied material to the Continental Army and may have participated in the battle of Guilford Court House. His descendants still live in the county. His grandson, Benjamin Lewis Bitting (1832-1922), built the house that gave Rural Hall its name.

Another early settler was Johann Adam Geiger (Kiger) who donated to the Nazareth Evangelical Lutheran Church, which still serves the community today. The town developed after the Cape Fear &amp; Yadkin Valley Railroad erected a station in 1887.

Rural Hall now is the operational center of the Yadkin Valley Railroad, and many of the Yadkin Valley locomotives can be found idling there when not working.

The Rural Hall Depot was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

<doc id="127892" wikidata="Q616587" url="?curid=127892" title="Framlingham">
<text>Framlingham is a market town and civil parish in Suffolk, England. 
Of Anglo-Saxon origin, it appears in the 1086 Domesday Book and was part of Loes Hundred. The parish had a population of 3,342 at the 2011 census and an estimated 4,016 in 2019. Nearby villages include Earl Soham, Kettleburgh, Parham, Saxtead and Sweffling.

==Governance==
An electoral ward of the same name exists. The parish stretches north-east to Brundish with a total ward population taken at the 2011 census of 4,744.

==Features==

Framlingham&#x27;s history can be traced to an entry in the Domesday Book (1086) when it consisted of several manors.

The medieval Framlingham Castle is a major feature and tourist attraction for the area and is managed by English Heritage. This Norman castle was first referenced in 1148, although some academics believe it could be as old as the 11th century. Mary Tudor (daughter of Henry VIII and his first wife Catherine of Aragon) was proclaimed the first Queen of England here in 1553. The castle is referenced in the 2017 single &quot;Castle on the Hill&quot; by Ed Sheeran, who grew up in Framlingham. Adjacent to the castle is a large lake, or mere, which used to supply the castle with fish. It is managed by the Suffolk Wildlife Trust. A nature walk in woodland can be made around the mere. There is also a large meadow adjacent to the castle that holds various outdoor events and productions in the summer and where people can picnic.

The Church of St Michael the Archangel is a prominent feature of the town. It dates from the 12th century (the main rebuilding dates from the late 15th and 16th centuries) and has a ring of eight bells dating from the 15th to 20th centuries. It also contains a very rare Thamar organ and a number of tombs of nobles. The church and other parts of the town feature as locations in the Anthony Horowitz novel &quot;Magpie Murders&quot;.

Framlingham has a football team, located in Badingham Road. The town has the two oldest-functioning Post Office pillar boxes in the UK, dating from 1856, located on Double Street and on College Road. The pillar boxes are marked V. R. Victoria Regina, after Queen Victoria.

Framlingham is also home to one of the smallest houses in Britain, the &quot;Check House&quot;. Converted into a two-storey residence of under , the former bookmaker&#x27;s office is in the Mauldens Mill Estate in the town centre. The ground floor measures by .

There is a traditional English market in the town square, Market Hill, every Tuesday and Saturday mornings offering fruit and vegetables, artisan bread and cakes, fresh fish, coffee, cheese and pies and other occasional stalls. A small museum is located within the castle.

Framlingham is surrounded by agricultural land. It lies some from the coastal town of Aldeburgh and from Southwold. It is also from the renowned music centre of Snape Maltings and from Woodbridge and the world-famous Anglo-Saxon burial site at Sutton Hoo. It is approximately from the A12, one of the main arteries into and out of Suffolk and approximately northeast of Ipswich.

In 2006, &quot;Country Life&quot; magazine voted Framlingham the best place to live in the country.

Framlingham is a Fairtrade Town and has a conservation area. An oak tree planted in 1911 in honour of the Coronation of King George V survives outside the old railway station, now a pub named &quot;The Station&quot; on Station Road. The town was the main location for the BBC television comedy series &quot;Detectorists&quot;. It has also appeared in numerous other TV programmes.

A famous family-orientated sausage festival is held in October. This event has butchers from Framlingham and the surrounding villages competing for the trophy of best sausage in the area. The town is closed to traffic on the day and people follow a map around the town sampling the different flavoured sausages and voting for their favourite. There are also market stalls and entertainment held on Market Hill on the day. Other festivals and events are held in the town and around the castle throughout the year.

==Education==
Framlingham College is an independent, co-educational secondary school for boarders and day students, opened as Albert Memorial College in 1865 in memory of Albert, Prince Consort. Its associated preparatory school is at Brandeston Hall.

Thomas Mills High School, dating from 1751, is considerably older than Framlingham College. It is a mixed secondary state school for pupils aged 11–18, which gained academy status in 2011. The singer Ed Sheeran attended this school.

Framlingham&#x27;s primary school is Sir Robert Hitcham&#x27;s Church of England Voluntary Primary School, dating back to at least 1654. It now has circa 350 pupils and another 26 in its nursery.

==Transport==
The Framlingham Branch connected Framlingham by rail with the main Ipswich to Lowestoft East Suffolk line at Wickham Market. The railway station building stands adjacent to the &quot;Station Hotel&quot;. The branch closed to passenger traffic in November 1952 and to goods in April 1965. The nearest stations today are Wickham Market () at Campsea Ashe and Saxmundham (), both on the East Suffolk Line.

The town is at the junction of the B1116, B1119 and B1120 roads, west of the A12. The local bus services are detailed on the Suffolk on Board site.

==Sport and leisure==
Framlingham has a non-League football club, Framlingham Town F.C., which plays at Badingham Road, where there is also a sports club offering tennis, archery, badminton, hockey and croquet, and where the cycling club meets. The town has a rambling club and an active Scout and Cubs group. The modern St John Ambulance Centre is in Fairfield Road.

Framlingham College, an independent school, has a swimming pool and gymnasium open to the public in pre-booked slots. Membership fees are required.

There are four pubs in the town: &quot;The Castle Inn&quot; (which was portrayed as the &quot;Two Brewers&quot; in the &quot;Detectorists&quot; TV series), &quot;The Railway&quot;, &quot;The Station&quot; and &quot;The Crown&quot; (which is also a restaurant and hotel). There is a library, a post office, a pharmacy, a small supermarket and a selection of specialised shops and coffee shops.

The town attracts a number of tourists, particularly in the summer months, drawn to the town itself, the castle, St Michael&#x27;s Church, the locations for the &quot;Detectorists&quot; TV series, and walks that are available in and around the town and in the local countryside.

<text>Winston-Salem is a city in and the county seat of Forsyth County, North Carolina, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 249,545, making it the fifth-most populous city in North Carolina and the 91st-most populous city in the United States. The population of the Winston-Salem metropolitan area was estimated to be 695,630 in 2023. It is the second-most populous city in North Carolina&#x27;s Piedmont Triad region, home to about 1.7 million residents.

Winston-Salem is called the &quot;Twin City&quot; for its dual heritage, and the &quot;Camel City&quot; as a reference to the city&#x27;s historic involvement in the tobacco industry related to locally based R. J. Reynolds&#x27; Camel cigarettes. Many North Carolinians refer to the city as &quot;Winston&quot; in informal speech. Winston-Salem is also home to six colleges and institutions, most notably Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem State University, and the University of North Carolina School of the Arts.

==History==

Siouan-speaking tribes such as the Cheraw and the Keyauwee Indians inhabited the area. Followers of the Moravian Church had interacted with Cherokees. The city of Winston-Salem is a product of the merging of the two neighboring towns of Winston and Salem in 1913.

===History of Salem===

The origin of the town of Salem dates to 1753, when Bishop August Gottlieb Spangenberg, on behalf of the Moravian Church, selected a settlement site in the three forks of Muddy Creek. He called this area &quot;die Wachau&quot; (Latin form &quot;Wachovia&quot;) after the ancestral estate of Count Nicolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf.
The land, just short of , was subsequently purchased from John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville.

On November 17, 1753, the first settlers arrived at what would later become the town of Bethabara. This town, despite its rapid growth, was not designed to be the primary settlement on the tract. Some residents expanded to a nearby settlement, called Bethania, in 1759. Finally, lots were drawn to select among suitable sites for the location of a new town.

The town established on the chosen site was given the name of Salem (from &quot;Shalom&quot;, Hebrew meaning &quot;Peace&quot;, after the Canaanite city mentioned in the Book of Genesis) chosen for it by the Moravians&#x27; late patron Count Zinzendorf. On January 6, 1766, the first tree was felled for the building of Salem. Salem was a typical Moravian settlement congregation, with the public buildings of the congregation grouped around a central square (today Salem Square). These included the church, a Brethren&#x27;s House, and a Sisters&#x27; House for the unmarried members of the congregation, which owned all the property in town. For many years, only members of the Moravian Church were permitted to live in the settlement. This practice had ended by the American Civil War. Many of the original buildings in the settlement have been restored or rebuilt and are now part of Old Salem Museums &amp; Gardens.

Salem was incorporated as a town in December 1856. Salem Square and God&#x27;s Acre Cemetery, the Moravian graveyard, have been the site of the Moravian sunrise service each Easter morning since 1772. This service, sponsored by all the Moravian church parishes in the city, attracts thousands of worshipers each year, some from overseas.

===History of Winston===
In 1849, the Salem Congregation sold land north of Salem to the newly formed Forsyth County for a county seat. The new town was called &quot;the county town&quot; or Salem until 1851, when it was renamed Winston for a local hero of the Revolutionary War, Joseph Winston. For its first two decades, Winston was a sleepy community. In 1868, work began by Salem and Winston business leaders to connect the town to the North Carolina Railroad. By the 1880s, there were many different tobacco factories in the town, with notable ones owned by Pleasant Hanes and R.J. Reynolds. Pleasant Hanes would later go on to found Hanes (formerly called Shamrock Knitting Mills) in 1900.

===Merger of Winston-Salem===

Robert Gray, as a featured speaker at the 1876 centennial celebration, was the first to mention the two towns as one. In the 1880s, the US Post Office began referring to the two towns together as Winston-Salem. In 1899, after nearly a decade of contention, the United States Post Office Department established the Winston-Salem post office in Winston, with the former Salem office serving as a branch. After a referendum the towns were officially incorporated as &quot;Winston-Salem&quot; in 1913.

The Reynolds family, namesake of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, played a large role in the history and public life of Winston-Salem. By the 1940s, 60% of Winston-Salem workers worked either for Reynolds or in the Hanes textile factories. The Reynolds company imported so much French cigarette paper and Turkish tobacco for Camel cigarettes that Winston-Salem was designated by the United States federal government as an official port of entry for the United States, despite the city being inland. Winston-Salem was the eighth-largest port of entry in the United States by 1916. In 1917, the Reynolds company bought of property in Winston-Salem and built 180 houses that it sold at cost to workers, to form a development called &quot;Reynoldstown&quot;. By the time R.J. Reynolds died in 1918, his company owned 121 buildings in Winston-Salem.

In 1920, with a population of 48,395, Winston-Salem was the largest city in North Carolina.

In 1929, the Reynolds Building was completed in Winston-Salem. Designed by William F. Lamb from the architectural firm Shreve, Lamb and Harmon, the Reynolds Building is a skyscraper that has 21 floors. When completed as the headquarters of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, it was the tallest building in the United States south of Baltimore, Maryland, and it was named the best building of the year by the American Institute of Architects. The building is well known for being the predecessor and prototype for the much larger Empire State Building, which was built in 1931 in New York City.

In 1892, Simon Green Atkins founded Slater Industrial Academy, which later became Winston-Salem State University, a public HBCU. In 1956, Wake Forest College, now known as Wake Forest University, moved to Winston-Salem from its original location in Wake Forest, North Carolina.

Winston-Salem was officially dubbed the &quot;City of Arts and Innovation&quot; in 2014.

===Notable early businesses===
* In 1799, the C. Winkler Bakery, noted for its Moravian cookies, was commissioned, and in 1807, the congregation brought in Christian Winkler of Pennsylvania to operate the bakery; his family owned and operated the business until 1929. It continues to operate today as part of Old Salem.
* In 1875, R. J. Reynolds founded R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, later famous for branded products such as Prince Albert pipe tobacco (1907) and Camel cigarettes (1913). Other brands that it made famous are Winston, Salem, Doral, and Eclipse cigarettes. The Winston-Salem area is still the primary international manufacturing center for Reynolds brands of cigarettes, although employment is down from its peak of nearly 30,000 to under 3,000.
* In 1901, J. Wesley Hanes&#x27; Shamrock Hosiery Mills in Winston-Salem began making men&#x27;s socks. Shortly afterward, his brother Pleasant Henderson Hanes founded the P.H. Hanes Knitting Company, which manufactured men&#x27;s underwear. The two firms eventually merged to become the Hanes Corporation, now known as Hanesbrands, manufacturing textiles.
* In 1906, the Bennett Bottling Company produced Bennett&#x27;s Cola, a &quot;Fine Carbonic Drink&quot;. The name was changed to Winston-Salem Bottling Works in 1915.
* In 1911, Wachovia Bank and Trust was formed by the merger of Wachovia National Bank (founded in 1879 by James Alexander Gray and William Lemly) and Wachovia Loan and Trust (founded 1893). The company was purchased by First Union in 2001, which changed its name to Wachovia. Wachovia was purchased by Wells Fargo in 2009, and the Wachovia name was retired in 2011.
* In 1928, Miller&#x27;s Clothing Store was opened by Mrs. Henry Miller. Miller&#x27;s Variety Store operated at the same location at 622 North Trade Street until closing at the end of 2016. Miller&#x27;s was the first store in Winston-Salem to offer bell-bottoms in the area in the 1960s. Miller&#x27;s was listed by &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in 1968 as a popular place to shop.
* In 1929, the local T.W. Garner Foods introduced Texas Pete, a popular hot sauce.
* In 1929, Quality Oil Company was organized in December 1929, initially to launch a distributorship for the then-little-known Shell Oil Company.
* In 1934, Malcolm Purcell McLean formed McLean Trucking Co. The firm benefited from the tobacco and textile industry headquartered in Winston-Salem, and became the second-largest trucking firm in the nation.
* In 1937, Krispy Kreme opened its first doughnut shop on South Main Street.
* In 1945, Piedmont Bible College opened (now Carolina University). 
* In 1948, Piedmont Airlines was formed out of the old Camel City Flying Service. The airline was based at Smith Reynolds Airport in Winston-Salem but marked its first commercial flight out of Wilmington, North Carolina, on February 20, 1948. Piedmont grew to become one of the top airlines in the country before its purchase by USAir (later US Airways, merged with American Airlines in 2015) in 1987. American Airlines maintains a reservation center in the old Piedmont reservations office.
