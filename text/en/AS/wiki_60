<text>Örebro County () is a county or &quot;län&quot; in central Sweden. It borders the counties of Västra Götaland, Värmland, Dalarna, Västmanland, Södermanland and Östergötland. It is frequently culturally divided into the hilly northern region of Bergslagen, where mining and metallurgic industry have been important since the Middle Ages, and the southern Mälardalen of lakes and farms.

== Province ==
Sweden&#x27;s counties are primarily administrative units, whereas the provinces of Sweden usually fit cultural and historical boundaries. Örebro County consists of the province of Närke, the western half of Västmanland and minor parts of eastern Värmland and northeastern Västergötland. Örebro County is named after its capital city, Örebro, which in 2010 was the sixth largest city of Sweden. Official 2010 numbers sourced in the localities section indicate that 38% of the county population is living in the city of Örebro alone. Örebro itself contains just as many inhabitants as the 23 other largest localities put together, and has grown significantly ever since the official statistics began in the late 1960s.

== Administration ==
The county was named Närke and Värmland County until 1779 when Värmland County seceded.

The main aim of the County Administrative Board is to fulfil the goals set in national politics by the Riksdag and the Government, to coordinate the interests of the county, to promote the development of the county, to establish regional goals and safeguard the due process of law in the handling of each case. The County Administrative Board is a Government Agency headed by a Governor. See List of Örebro Governors.

== Politics ==

The County Council of Örebro or &quot;Örebro läns landsting&quot;, which is appointed by the electorate of the county, is primarily responsible for health care and public transportation.

==Riksdag elections==
The table details all Riksdag election results of Örebro County since the unicameral era began in 1970. The blocs denote which party would support the Prime Minister or the lead opposition party towards the end of the elected parliament.

==Geography and climate ==

The southern Närke plain, the forested north and the highland to the west makes for a varying landscape. Örebro County is located between the four major lakes of Sweden and has coastlines on two of them. Capital Örebro is alongside Hjälmaren, located slightly inland along Svartån. The southern area of the county has a transitional climate between oceanic and continental, with warm summers and cold, variable winters. Örebro has a July high of around and winter highs around with frosts being frequent from November to April. The proximity to the major lakes moderates winter temperatures somewhat, undermining the continental effects of its inland position. The northern areas of the county are slightly cooler year-round. The summer temperatures on the Närke Plain are some of the warmest in all of Scandinavia and by extension Northern Europe.

== Municipalities ==

Örebro County is divided into 12 municipalities.

<text>A helmet is a form of protective gear worn to protect the head. More specifically, a helmet complements the skull in protecting the human brain. Ceremonial or symbolic helmets (e.g., a policeman&#x27;s helmet in the United Kingdom) without protective function are sometimes worn. Soldiers wear combat helmets, often made from Kevlar or other lightweight synthetic fibers.

The word &quot;helmet&quot; is derived from &quot;helm&quot;, an Old English word for a protective head covering.

Helmets are used for most sports (e.g., jockeys, American football, ice hockey, cricket, baseball, skiing, hurling and rock climbing); dangerous work activities such as construction, mining, riot police, military aviation, and in transportation (e.g. motorcycle helmets and bicycle helmets). Since the 1990s, most helmets are made from resin or plastic, which may be reinforced with fibers such as aramids.

==Designs==
Some British gamekeepers during the 18th and 19th centuries wore helmets made of straw bound together with cut bramble. Europeans in the tropics often wore the pith helmet, developed in the mid-19th century and made of pith or cork.

Military applications in the 19th–20th centuries saw a number of leather helmets, particularly among aviators and tank crews in the early 20th century. In the early days of the automobile, some motorists also adopted this style of headgear, and early football helmets were also made of leather. In World War II, American, Soviet, German, Italian and French flight crews wore leather helmets, the German pilots disguising theirs under a beret before disposing of both and switching to cloth caps. The era of the First and Second World Wars also saw a resurgence of metal military helmets, most notably the Brodie helmet and the Stahlhelm.

Modern helmets have a much wider range of applications, including helmets adapted to the specific needs of many athletic pursuits and work environments, and these helmets very often incorporate plastics and other synthetic materials for their light weight and shock absorption capabilities. Some types of synthetic fibers used to make helmets in the 21st century include aramid fibers, such as Kevlar and Twaron. Race car helmets include a head and neck support system that keeps the helmet (and head) attached to the body in severe collisions.

==Helmet types==
Helmets of many different types have developed over time. Most early helmets had military uses, though some may have had more ceremonial than combat applications.

Two important helmet types to develop in antiquity were the Corinthian helmet and the Roman galea.

During the Middle Ages, many different military helmets and some ceremonial helmets were developed, almost all being metal. Some of the more important medieval developments included the great helm, the bascinet, the frog-mouth helm, and the armet.

The great seal of Owain Glyndŵr (c. 1359 – c. 1415) depicts the prince of Wales and his stallion wearing full armour, they both wear protective headgear with Owain&#x27;s gold dragon mounted on top. This would have been impractical in battle, so therefore these would have been ceremonial.

In the 19th century, more materials were incorporated, namely leather, felt and pith. The pith helmet and the leather pickelhaube were important 19th century developments. The greatest expansion in the variety of forms and composition of helmets, however, took place in the 20th century, with the development of highly specialized helmets for a multitude of athletic and professional applications, as well as the advent of modern plastics. During World War I, the French army developed the Adrian helmet, the British developed the Brodie helmet, and the Germans produced the Stahlhelm.

The development of hard hats for workplace safety may have been inspired by the helmets of WWI, and they have become a standard type of safety equipment on many construction job sites and industrial locations.

Flight helmets were also developed throughout the 20th century. A multitude of athletic helmets, including football helmets, batting helmets, hockey helmets, cricket helmets, bicycle helmets, ski helmets, motorcycle helmets and racing helmets, were also developed in the 20th century.

Helmets since the mid-20th century have often incorporated lightweight plastics and other synthetic materials, and their use has become highly specialized. Some important recent developments include the French SPECTRA helmet, Spanish MARTE helmet or the American PASGT (commonly called &quot;Kevlar&quot; by U.S. troops) and Advanced Combat Helmet, or ACH.

==Heraldry==
As the coat of arms was originally designed to distinguish noble combatants on the battlefield or in a tournament, even while covered in armour, it is not surprising that heraldic elements constantly incorporated the shield and the helmet, these often being the most visible parts of a knight&#x27;s military equipment.

The practice of indicating peerage through the display of barred or grilled helmets first appeared around 1587-1615, and the heraldic convention of displaying helmets of rank in the United Kingdom, which came into vogue around Stuart times, is as follows:
* Sovereign: a gold barred-face (tournament) helm placed affronté
* Peer&#x27;s helmet: silver barred-face (tournament) helm placed in profile
* Knight&#x27;s or baronet&#x27;s helmet: steel helm (earlier jousting helm, later close helm) placed affronté with visor open
* Esquire&#x27;s helmet: steel helm placed in profile with visor closed

Earlier rolls of arms reveal, however, that early heraldic helmets were depicted in a manner faithful to the styles in actual military or tournament use at the time.

<doc id="132152" wikidata="Q508180" url="?curid=132152" title="Hallsberg Municipality">
<text>Hallsberg Municipality (&quot;Hallsbergs kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Örebro County in central Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Hallsberg, which is the main railway hub for the central Swedish interior.

The present municipality was created in 1971 when the market town (&quot;köping&quot;) of Hallsberg was amalgamated with adjacent municipalities. A series of amalgamations had taken place in the area in 1952, 1963 and 1967.

==Localities==
*Hallsberg (seat)
*Hjortkvarn
*Pålsboda
*Sköllersta
*Vretstorp
*Östansjö

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Hallsberg Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 16,166 residents, including 11,930 Swedish citizens of voting age resident in the municipality. 49.3% voted for the left coalition and 49.4% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Elections==
These are the results of the elections in the municipality since the first election after the municipal reform, being held in 1973. The exact results of Sweden Democrats were not listed at a municipal level by SCB from 1988 to 1998 due to the party&#x27;s small size at the time. &quot;Turnout&quot; denotes the percentage of eligible people casting any ballots, whereas &quot;Votes&quot; denotes the number of valid votes only.

===Riksdag===
Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party.

==Twin towns==
Hallsberg&#x27;s three twin towns with the year of its establishing:

* Toijala, Finland (since 1946)
* Valga, Estonia (since 1991)
* Gifhorn, Germany (since 1996)

Hällefors used to be the seat of Hellefors Bruks AB, which in the early 20th century was one of the largest manufacturing companies in central Sweden. It produced iron and steel, mechanical wood pulp, sulfite and sulfate pulp, sawn timber, joinery and box boards. It mined, for its own requirements and for sale, ore from its own iron ore fields. At a large number of its own power stations, situated on Svartälven and its tributaries, the company produced electrical energy which was widely distributed to its own works and outside customers. The company also grew timber on a large scale, and an extensive private railway system runs right through the company&#x27;s forests which cover several hundred thousand acres in Hällefors and surrounding municipalities. The general management of the company was at Hällefors, where the company operated ironworks, a wood-grinding mill, a sawmill, a box factory and joinery works.

The small town Loka is located in Hällefors Municipality. They are bottling mineral water from their well, that once housed a thermal bath. The water is sold in almost any store in Sweden, including Systembolaget.

Its history stretches back to the 12th century, when the convent Ramundeboda was founded about 4 km west of the town.

The Tiveden National Park is partly situated within the municipality.

<text>Ljusnarsberg Municipality (&quot;Ljusnarsbergs kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Örebro County in central Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Kopparberg.

In 1908 Kopparberg was detached from the rural municipality Ljusnarsberg to form a market town (&quot;köping&quot;). In 1962 they were reunited.

It was the birthplace of Hjalmar Andersson, A cross country runner

== Geography ==
Kopparberg is located by the outlet of the Arboga River, about 80 km north of Örebro. The municipality borders the province or &quot;landskap&quot; Dalarna to the north. One of the highest points is the mountain Gillersklack which is a popular winter resort with both downhill and cross country skiing.
Ljusnarsberg lies in a mountainous mid-lower-central district of Sweden named Bergslagen (Berg = mountain, lag = law). While Swedish municipalities typically are named after their seat, Ljusnarsberg got a different name due to Dalarna County to its north being known as Kopparberg County after a Falun copper mine until 1997.

The area has historically been a mining district.

=== Localities ===
Town with over 50 inhabitants:
* Kopparberg, including Bångbro 3,300 (seat)
* Ställdalen 736
* Stjärnfors
* Ställberg
* Högfors
* Mossgruvan
* Hörken
* Bastkärn
* Silverhöjden
* Yxsjöberg

== Economy ==
One of the largest industries is the Kopparbergs Brewery, making beer and cider distributed both nation- and worldwide, and is arguably one of the best known brands of that kind in Sweden.

The municipality is part of a regional &quot;KNÖL&quot;-group (acronym for &quot;Kommuner i Norra Örebro Län&quot;), consisting of Ljusnarsberg Municipality, Nora Municipality, Lindesberg Municipality and Hällefors Municipality.

==Demographics==

Ljusnarsberg is a low-income municipality with high levels of unemployment and relatively few college graduates. There is a relatively high proportion of people with foreign background at about 23%, quite evenly spread throughout the districts. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

<text>Cambridge Springs is a borough with home rule status in Crawford County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,583 at the 2020 census, down from 2,595 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
The village of Cambridge was settled in 1822 and named for the town of Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was incorporated into the borough of Cambridgeboro on April 3, 1866.

In the late 19th century, Cambridgeboro was known for its mineral springs. The discovery of the springs eventually led to the borough being renamed to Cambridge Springs on April 1, 1897. It was a resort town featuring a variety of hotels including the Rider Hotel, which burned down in 1931. The last of these hotels, the Riverside Inn, burned down on May 2, 2017, and had been listed in the National Register of Historic Places since 1978. Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places are the Cambridge Springs Bridge and Amos Kelly House.

In 1904, the Rider Hotel in Cambridge Springs was the site of a famous chess tournament won by Frank Marshall ahead of World Champion Emanuel Lasker and fourteen other players. A variation of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined opening played several times there is today known as the Cambridge Springs Defense (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Nbd7 5.e3 c6 6.Nf3 Qa5 in algebraic notation).

From 1912 to 1987, it was home to Alliance College. In 1912, United States President William Howard Taft traveled to Cambridge Springs for the dedication. The site of the college is now occupied by the State Correctional Institution – Cambridge Springs, a minimum-security prison.

In the early 20th century, the town became a &quot;veritable &#x27;Mecca&#x27; to chronic hoboes&quot; who were interested in meeting Leon Ray Livingston, the famed hobo and author who had established Cambridge Springs as his home base while not traveling.

The borough adopted a home rule charter on May 21, 1974, that took effect on January 5, 1976. While the community&#x27;s official name remains the &quot;Borough of Cambridge Springs&quot;, it is no longer subject to the Pennsylvania Borough Code.

<text>Conneaut Lake is a borough in Crawford County, Pennsylvania, located at the southern end of the lake of the same name. The population was 625 at the 2020 census, down from 653 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The town was founded in 1799 as &quot;Evansburg&quot;, named for local farmer Abner Evans, who had opened a successful mill, of which several more followed. The town’s population would continue to grow as soon it would be connected to other towns by a canal and later by railroad.

By the 1880’s the town’s economy boomed with the foundation of several important businesses, most notably, the famous tool company Channellock and The Conneaut Lake Ice Company (which was a major supplier of fresh ice for cities and towns around the northeast).

As locals around the area were colloquially referring to the town as the name of the neighboring lake, the town was officially renamed Conneaut in 1892. The same year the famous local park was also opened, and the town became become a major tourist destination in Western Pennsylvania.
In 1907 trolley lines were installed that connected the town and park with several other local towns, but by the 1920s these were mostly removed due to the automobile rendering it obsolete.

By the 1930’s the rise of refrigeration meant that most towns no longer needed fresh ice to preserve food, and thus saw the closure of the town’s Ice Company. This along and the closure/moving of other companies caused town’s local population to decline (although the population rose once again in the mid 20th century). Today the town serves mainly as a resourt town, home to many shops, restaurants and other amenities.

<text>Boxholm Municipality () is a municipality in Östergötland County in southeast Sweden. Its seat is located in the industrial town of Boxholm.

The present municipality was formed in 1971, when the market town (&quot;köping&quot;) Boxholm (itself instituted in 1947) was amalgamated with &quot;Södra Göstring&quot; and a parish (&quot;Rinna&quot;) from the dissolved municipality of &quot;Folkunga&quot;.

*Boxholm (seat)
*Strålsnäs

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Boxholm Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 5,511 residents, including 4,307 Swedish citizens of voting age. 48.6% voted for the left coalition and 50.0% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==History==
The earliest human traces are from the Stone Age, circa 8000 BC. From some later times, the Nordic Bronze Age, are several remains such as cists and gravefields. And from the Viking Age, ca 800–1,000 AD, are seven kept runestones.

After the christianisation of Sweden, churches were built in the 12th and 13th century, and several churches have their foundation from that time.

The name &quot;Boxholm&quot; is first to be found in the 16th century, as the name of a manor by Arvid Stenbock. Boxholm thus comes from &quot;Bock&#x27;s holm&quot; (&quot;holm&quot; a modern Swedish and Old Norse word for islet).

An iron works was constructed in 1754, and a community grew up around it. The major expansion were however made in the 1850–1900.

==Elections==

===Riksdag===
These are the results of the Riksdag elections of Finspång Municipality since the 1972 municipality reform. The results of the Sweden Democrats were not published by SCB between 1988 and 1998 at a municipal level to the party&#x27;s small nationwide size at the time. &quot;Votes&quot; denotes valid votes, whereas &quot;Turnout&quot; denotes also blank and invalid votes.

Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party. &quot;Elected&quot; is the total number of percentage points from the municipality that went to parties who were elected to the Riksdag.

<text>Linköping ( , ) is a city in southern Sweden, with around 167,000 inhabitants as of 2024. It is the seat of Linköping Municipality and the capital of Östergötland County. Linköping is also the episcopal see of the Diocese of Linköping (Church of Sweden) and is well known for its cathedral. Linköping is the center of an old cultural region and celebrated its 700th anniversary in 1987. Dominating the city&#x27;s skyline from afar is the steeple of the cathedral ().

Nowadays, Linköping is known for its university and its high-technology industry. Linköping wants to create a sustainable development of the city and therefore plans to become a carbon-neutral community by 2025. Located on the Östergötland Plain, Linköping is closely linked to Norrköping, roughly to the east, near the sea.

==History==


The city is possibly named after the &quot;Lionga ting&quot; assembly which according to Medieval Scandinavian laws was the most important thing in Östergötland. Exact location of the Lionga ting is not known, but it was along the Eriksgata. The term &quot;-köping&quot; means there was a market there.

Historically, Linköping is famed for being an early diocese, 1082, second in Sweden (within its pre-1658 boundaries) only to Skara. The diocese is first mentioned in 1104 in the so-called &quot;List of Florence&quot; (&quot;Lionga. Kaupinga&quot;). The monastery of Vreta Kloster near Roxen north of Linköping was established in 1128, and the oldest parts of the cathedral are also from the 12th century (although it has been changed many times since then, the eye-catching tower with copper roofing being a 19th-century product). On several occasions attempts to achieve a separate Swedish archdiocese were based in Linköping, although, when they finally were successful in 1164, Uppsala was chosen instead.

The coronation of Valdemar Birgersson took place in the cathedral in 1251. In the reign of Gustavus Vasa several important diets were held in the town.

Religious centers tend to become educational centers, and Linköping was no exception. A cathedral school can be traced from 1266. In 1627 the current Linköping cathedral school was established, making it the third oldest gymnasium in Sweden.

Also, Linköping was the site for the final settlement of the dispute between king Sigismund III Vasa and his uncle Duke Charles, the latter prevailing in the battle of Stångebro (the main bridge in Linköping) on 25 September 1598. This ultimately led to the rise to the throne of Charles (&quot;de facto&quot; at the 1600 Riksdag of the Estates meeting in Linköping and formally four years later) and the end of the short-lived Swedish-Polish personal union, as well as the execution of five of Charles&#x27;s political opponents on the main square of Linköping on 20 March 1600.

Linköping was a small town until 1937, when the Saab aircraft industry was formed, starting a period of rapid expansion. Linköping University was established in the 1960s. Today the city is a center of high-technology and software industry.

== Climate ==
Linköping has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;), though with maritime influences, retaining the large differences between seasons but being comparatively mild when measured against other areas of the world on similar latitudes. Linköping tends to be slightly cooler in summer than nearby areas in the Mälar valley, but still was the weather station in Sweden among the officially listed for monthly statistics, that until 2018 had come the closest to a subtropical month, with July 1914 having a mean temperature of , with the subtropical border being at for the warmest month. Normally summer highs average in the low 20s and winter temperatures commonly hover just above the freezing point during the day, then falls below it at night.

== Demography ==

In 2000, 10.9 per cent of the population in Linköping municipality had a foreign background. Since then, the share has gradually increased and in 2019 its share amounted to 23.1 percent. Top 5 largest immigrant communities are:

1. Iraq – 3850

2. Somalia - 2345

3. Eritrea - 1129

4. Iran - 988

5. Bosnia and Herzegovina - 667

==Culture==

Linköping offers a wealth of leisure activities to people of all ages. Residents and visitors are able to enjoy art, theatre, history, concerts, markets, festivals and sporting events.

Special sights of interests are: the locks of Berg on the Göta Canal, the locks of the Kinda Canal, &quot;Gamla&quot; Linköping, Valla &quot;skogen&quot; and Valla &quot;fritidsområde&quot; (Old Linköping, Valla Wood, and the Valla recreational area), &quot;Flygvapen&quot; museum (the Air Force Museum), Linköping&#x27;s &quot;domkyrka&quot; (the cathedral), &quot;Slotts- och domkyrkomuseet&quot; (the Castle and Cathedral Museum) and &quot;Östergötlands Länsmuseum&quot; (the Östergötland County Museum). &quot;Konsthallen Passagen&quot; is an art gallery located in the main square.

Tornby, to the north of the city centre, is a shopping area with retail outlets.

The city and its environs offer all sorts of green landscapes to see and experience. Two examples are a park named after the group responsible for it, &quot;Trädgårdsföreningen&quot; (The Garden Society), and the Tinnerö area with its oak woodland. Local bodies of water include the lakes Roxen, Rängen and Järnlunden, the River Stångån/Kinda Canal and the Göta Canal with the Berg locks. These areas can be accessed by foot, bicycle, or boat.

Linköping is the home of the Linköping Symphony Orchestra. The city is one of the sites of the &quot;Östergötland Music Days&quot; each summer, and the host of the &quot;Student Orchestra Festival&quot; in May every other year. One of the most notable choirs in Linköping is the Linköping University Male Voice Choir.

Linköping is also the home of theatrical heavy metal band Ghost and rock band the Pusjkins (sv).

The area around the main square was re-planned in the 1960s, and many old houses were destroyed. Some, however, were moved to &quot;Gamla Linköping&quot; (Old Linköping), in the city&#x27;s western part, neighbouring the university&#x27;s main campus. It is a living museum environment and a popular site with both residents and tourists.

NärCon, the largest anime and gaming convention in the Nordic countries, is held in Linköping.

==Sport==
Teams from Linköping are prominent in floorball, volleyball (Linköpings VC) and ice hockey (Linköpings HC; see above, or &quot;Cluben&quot; as some fans refer to it). The hockey team allied itself with Linköping&#x27;s women&#x27;s football team and created Linköpings FC, which plays in the highest division. The team won the Swedish Cup in 2006 and 2014. The world&#x27;s largest floorball club Linköping Innebandy resides in the indoor sports arena in the city centre.

The first venue was at the old Linköping Motorstadion or Gamla Motorstadion in Ryd (the site where Linköpings Rugbyklubb play). When this speedway track was demolished in 1972, the team moved to the Sviestad Motorstadion in 1973 until their closure in 2010. The stadium continues to host events and held the World Championship round called the Speedway Grand Prix of Sweden from 1995 to 2000 and the 2022 Swedish Individual Speedway Championship.

<text>Vadstena Municipality (&quot;Vadstena kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Östergötland County in southeast Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Vadstena.

The old &quot;City of Vadstena&quot; was during the nationwide local government reform of the 1970s merged into Motala Municipality in 1974. This &quot;marriage&quot; was unsuccessful and a &quot;divorce&quot; was soon agreed upon and in 1980 the present municipality was created. It contains, however, 12 original units.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Vadstena Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 7,517 residents, including 6,185 Swedish citizens of voting age. 48.1% voted for the left coalition and 51.2% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Nature==
Vadstena is situated by lake Vättern, Sweden&#x27;s second largest lake. Fishing was an important source of food when the town was first founded around the year 1000 AD, and it continued to be dependent on fish and ship merchandise.

There are two nature reserves in the municipality:
*The &quot;Ombergsliden&quot;, 230,000 m2 large, a lime-rich marsh. It has several notable plants, such as the uncommon orchid Tuber geophyte (&quot;Gymnadenia odoratissima&quot;), and the carnivorous Butterwort plant .
*The &quot;Kastad kulle torräng&quot; is a drumlin rich on lime, and hosts several plants otherwise not found in the area, such as the Oxytropis pilosa, otherwise very sparsely outside of Gotland .

==Sights==
*Vadstena Castle
*Vadstena Abbey
*The Vadstena Hospital area and museum with buildings from the 16th century to the 20th century.
*&quot;Herrestad Church&quot;, inaugurated in 1112, which makes it one of the oldest dated stone churches in Sweden (the Holy Cross Church in Dalby, Skåne, Sweden was built &quot;around&quot; 1060). The church tower was constructed around a century later, and is largely unmodified throughout the centuries.
*&quot;Rogslösa Church&quot;, from the 13th century, which is especially notable for its ornaments of Celtic influences.
*There are also other interesting medieval churches in the municipality, such as &quot;Hagebyhöga Church&quot;, &quot;Väversunda Church&quot;, &quot;Hov Church&quot;, &quot;Örberga Church&quot; and &quot;Nässja Church&quot;. Most of these were begun on in the 12th century.

Relative to other areas of southern Sweden Ydre stands out for its low precipitation and low humidity. The rainiest months of the years are September followed by July and August. Each of these months had a precipitation of c. 70 mm. The driest months are February and March, with 35 mm each. The hottest months are July, Juni and August averaging 14–15 °C. The coldest months are January and February with about -4 °C. The climate is expected to become warmer and drier in future.

The growing season around Sommen is of about 216 days with 2614 degree days. The vegetation in Ydre is mostly dominated by pine and spruce forest. Broad-leaf forest and open agricultural fields can also be found at some locations. In particular the southern shores of lake Sommen contain more lush vegetation and broad-leaf forest than the northern side, which has more cliffs and contiguous pine forests. The rare and endangered flower &quot;Anthericum liliago&quot; can be found along the lake&#x27;s rocky shores. This is one of the northernmost locales where it grows.

In Torpön island grows Sweden&#x27;s largest wych elm and at Asby, a few kilometers from the southern shores grows Sweden&#x27;s thickest spruce. The name Ydre, which was formerly applied to most of the area around Sommen, is interpreted to mean &quot;place of yews&quot;. One locality in particular appears to be further associated with yews. This is Idebo along Norra Vifjärden.

Some plants usually associated to carbonate rock areas appears as rarities near Sommen, since there are no known carbonate rock outcrops in the area. The plants are &quot;Vicia pisiformis&quot; and the orchids &quot;Ophrys myoides&quot;, &quot;Malaxis monophyllos&quot;, &quot;Herminium monorchis&quot;.

==History==
===Trolls, jättar and Christianization===
There are various tales of jättar and trolls opposing the spread of Christianity in Ydre. Likely church building followed a tradition that &quot;the king&quot; should begin the building, and then the local populace finish it. This was later codified in Östgötalagen. It is not known when the first churches around the lake were built. For comparison, the church in nearby Tidersrum was built in 1300, and Leonhard Fredrik Rääf asserts that the church in Sund was built in the 12th century.

===Reformation and wars===

As Nils Dacke&#x27;s and his army advanced north through Ydre in 1542, local priests from Sund and Asby, and the populace in general, welcomed the rebellion as they were rejected church reforms imposed on them by Gustav Vasa. In particular, the priest of Sund and Norra Vi preached uprising. However local aristocrat Måns Johansson Natt och Dag who owned the manor of Ringshult sided with the king despite having a troublesome relation to him. He was put in charge of an army to suppress the rebellion. As Dacke&#x27;s troops continued their advance north reaching as far as Mjölby the area around lake Sommen was spared from war. Skirmishes did occur near Kisa, tens of kilometers northeast of Sommen. Unrest in Ydre continued well after the death of Dacke and ended only after Gustav Vasa sent a force of 400 men to pacify the hundred.

Despite earlier defense of Catholicism at the Uppsala Synod in 1593 church representatives from Ydre voted to adopt the Lutheran creed.

==Sights==

At least two churches have medieval foundation: The &quot;Church of Asby&quot; in Asby, and the &quot;Church of Torpa&quot; on the countryside. There is also an attractive church from the 18th century, &quot;Church of Norra Vi&quot;, located just by the lake Sommen.

Another tourist attraction is Naturum Sommen in Torpön Island, a visitor center and natural history museum.

<text>Åtvidaberg Municipality (&quot;Åtvidabergs kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Östergötland County in southeastern Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Åtvidaberg, with some 7,000 inhabitants.

The present municipality was established in 1971 when the market town (&quot;köping&quot;) of &quot;Åtvidaberg&quot; (instituted in 1947) was amalgamated with its surrounding rural municipalities. A part of the present territory was transferred from Kalmar County.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Åtvidaberg Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 11,454 residents, including 9,075 Swedish citizens of voting age. 47.7% voted for the left coalition and 51.3% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Notability==
The &quot;Åtvidabergs Vagnfabrik&quot; (Wagon Factory), was founded in 1910 and constructed early cars. A total of 12 cars were made. They resembled the American carriage with large wheels.

The Åtvidaberg church &quot;Stora Kyrkan&quot; (&quot;the Big Church&quot;) was built in the 1870s in neo-Gothic style. The remains of a 17th-century church were also of interest. It was rebuilt and is now functioning as a church again, &quot;Gamla Kyrkan&quot; (&quot;the Old Church&quot;).

At the end of the 19th century almost one third of the population of Åtvidaberg Municipality in Sweden emigrated to Ishpeming, Michigan in the United States as copper mines in the Åtvidaberg area closed down. In 1994 this was commemorated by a plaquette at the Mormorsgruvan mine of Åtvidaberg.

At Eksäter, north of the railway, there is a statue representing David Drummond (1593-1638). He was for a time an officer at the Östgöta foot with residence in Slevringe outside Åtvidaberg. He later became colonel of Kalmar Regiment. David Drummond is the first known tobacco smoker in Sweden.

==Nature==
A large part of the municipality borders lake Vättern. There is a small harbour.

There are two nature reserves within the municipal borders: &quot;Isberga&quot; with a distinguished steppe meadow flora , and &quot;Kråkeryd&quot; located on rocks above Vättern at 60 meters altitude. Kråkeryd has a geology rich in lime, and the uncultivated rocky terrain is the location for several unusual flowers and plants .

==Localities==
There are two urban areas (also called a Tätort or locality) in Ödeshög Municipality.

In the table the localities are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2005. The municipal seat is in bold characters.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Ödeshög Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

<text>Linesville is a borough in Crawford County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 961 at the 2020 census, down from 987 at the 2019 census. The town derives its name from its founders, who included William Line (the grandson of a Swiss immigrant), who migrated from Carlisle, Pennsylvania, &quot;circa&quot; the early 1820s, and his relative, Amos Line, who was the town&#x27;s surveyor and main proprietor. Amos Line &quot;penetrated the western Pennsylvania wilderness as a member of the Pennsylvania Population Company in the early 1800s.&quot;

==History==

According to the town&#x27;s history, Linesville was settled by Amos Line, who was born in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. &quot;Line established a mill at the site in 1820. The village was laid out in 1825. It was first known as Line&#x27;s Mills, but the name was changed to Linesville Station in 1864. It was not known as Linesville until 1883. It was incorporated from Pine Township on March 22, 1862.

==Points of interest==
There are several points of interest throughout the town, chiefly Pymatuning Lake and the Linesville Spillway. In warm weather, the spillway on the sanctuary (eastern) side is home to thousands of oversized carp, attracted by the bread thrown into the water by visitors; this is known as &quot;The Place Where the Ducks Walk on the Fish&quot;, coined by local businessman Alpine Maclaine. The spillway is locally billed as &quot;Pennsylvania&#x27;s second most popular tourist attraction, after the Liberty Bell&quot;, and the logo of the Linesville Volunteer Fire Department used to be a duck standing on the back of a fish.

Pymatuning Lake is one of the largest man-made lakes in Pennsylvania. It was created in the 1930s as a Depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) project. Linesville is also home to the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology.

Linesville is the birthplace of noteworthy traveler Winfield Line (Amos Line&#x27;s great-great-grandson) who, in 1922-23 with his brother Francis, hiked/hitchhiked through every state in the Union. This pair of brothers later wrote a book entitled &quot;Foot by Foot Through the USA, A High Adventure Odyssey to Every State in the Union&quot;, which chronicled their journey.

Another minor point of interest is at the main intersection of the town (at its sole traffic light). On the Maclaine Building at the northwest corner is a sign reading &quot;CHICAGO: 500 miles NEW YORK: 500 miles&quot; (the true midpoint between the two is actually about a mile west).

At one time, Linesville was the onion capital of the United States, distributing its fragrant produce via the Erie &amp; Pittsburgh Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad.

Linesville made national news in November 2005 when 18-year-old Christopher Seeley was elected mayor, one of the youngest mayors to serve in a U.S. city to date.

<text>Meadville is a city in and the county seat of Crawford County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 13,050 at the 2020 census. The first permanent settlement in Northwestern Pennsylvania, Meadville is within of Erie and within of Pittsburgh. It is the principal city of the Meadville micropolitan area, as well as part of the larger Erie–Meadville combined statistical area.

==History==
===Settlement and establishment===
The Meadville area was the ancestral land of the Eriechronon people until the Iroquois Confederacy forced them out. Having been displaced from their ancestral lands in what is now Eastern Pennsylvania, the Lenape moved into the now unoccupied region. They formed an alliance with the neighboring Seneca, one of the five tribes that made up the Iroquois Confederacy, and other displaced Lenape. Under the leadership of Chief Custaloga, they founded the settlement of Cussewago. Custaloga&#x27;s name first appeared in western Pennsylvania&#x27;s history in George Washington&#x27;s journal of 1754. When Washington arrived in the village of Venango (Fort Machault), Custaloga was in charge of the wampum of his nation. This wampum was a message that was sent to the Six Nations if the French refused to leave the land. Custaloga was the chief of the Munsee or Wolf Clan of Delawares and he also ruled over the Delawares at the town of Cussewago, at the present site of Meadville.

After Cussewago was abandoned, Meadville was laid out by William McArthur Sr. and settled on May 12, 1788, by a party of settlers led by David Mead. Its location at the confluence of Cussewago Creek and French Creek was only a day&#x27;s travel by boat to the safety of Fort Franklin. The neighboring Iroquois and Lenape befriended the isolated settlement, but their enemies, including the Wyandots, were not so amiable. The threat of their attacks caused the settlement to be evacuated for a time in 1791. Around 1800, many of the settlers to the Meadville area came after receiving land bounties for service in the American Revolutionary War. Allegheny College was founded in April 1815 by Timothy Alden. Meadville became an important transportation center after the construction of the French Creek Feeder Canal in 1837 and of the Beaver and Erie Canal it connected to at Conneaut Lake and subsequent railroad development.

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Meadville played a small part in the Underground Railroad helping escaping slaves to freedom. An event in September 1880 led to the end of segregation by race in the state&#x27;s public schools. At the South Ward schools, Elias Allen tried unsuccessfully to enroll his two children. He appealed to the Crawford County Court of Common Pleas, and Judge Pearson Church declared unconstitutional the 1854 state law mandating separate schools for Negro children. This law was amended, effective July 4, 1881, to prohibit such segregation.

===Industrial growth===

The League of Friendship, Mechanical Order of the Sun, a fraternal beneficiary labor organization was formed at Meadville in April 1868, and dissolved in October, with the establishment of the Ancient Order of United Workmen as the succeeding organization. 

By the late 19th century, Meadville&#x27;s economy was also driven by logging, agriculture, and iron production. The Talon Corporation, headquartered in Meadville, played a major role in the development of the zipper. Since the clothing industry was largely unaffected by the Great Depression, the community saw a population boom at that time. During World War II, the nearby Keystone Ordnance plant brought additional jobs to the area. 

The high demand for zippers created favorable conditions for the Talon Company, and so became Meadville&#x27;s most crucial industry. The company encountered significant difficulties after it was absorbed by Textron industries in 1968, eventually ending up bankrupt. However, as a result of the need for close tolerances and tool and die makers, a cottage industry of tool and die shops was established which resulted in Meadville, earning the city the nickname Tool City with more tool shops per capita than any place else in the United States.

In 1886, a blacksmith from Evansburg, Pennsylvania, George B. DeArment, began hand-forging farrier&#x27;s tools and selling them from town to town out of the back of a wagon. The business eventually became known as the Champion Bolt and Clipper Company. In 1904, now named Channellock, the company moved to a facility in Meadville and added nippers, pinchers, and open-end wrenches to its product line. George B. DeArment&#x27;s two sons, Almon W. and J. Howard DeArment became partners in the company in 1911 and expanded the product line again to include hammers. In 1923, the company moved again to a facility at its current location. Four years later, the name of the company was changed to the Champion–DeArment Tool Company.

Talon remained a major employer, along with the Erie Railroad, American Viscose Corporation (later known as Avtex Fibers), Channellock tools, and Dad&#x27;s Pet Food. The area actually saw an increase in population during the Great Depression and the economy continued to grow past World War II. By the early 1990s, Channellock and Dad&#x27;s were the only large companies operating in Meadville. This blow to the local economy was softened by a subsequent surge in light industry, mainly tool and die machine shops. The song &quot;Bittersweet Motel&quot; by Vermont jam band, Phish, was inspired when keyboardist Page McConnell left a wedding in Meadville and drove to the Pittsburgh Airport.

In addition to the Meadville Downtown Historic District, several buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Baldwin-Reynolds House, Bentley Hall (Allegheny College), Independent Congregational Church, Dr. J. R. Mosier Office, Roueche House, Ruter Hall (Allegheny College), and Judge Henry Shippen House.

==Arts and culture==
A replica of founder David Mead&#x27;s log cabin, the first permanent settlement in northwestern Pennsylvania, is located at Bicentennial Park along the banks of French Creek. The replica was built as a part of Meadville&#x27;s Bicentennial celebration in 1988. The cabin is used as an educational resource for school tours and the general public.

The Market House is a prominent historical building located in downtown Meadville. It is the oldest continuously run market structure in the state of Pennsylvania, and still serves as a hub for local farmers. Farmers markets are still held on Saturdays.

The Baldwin-Reynolds House, managed by the Crawford County Historical Society, is a house museum in town. The building was constructed in 1843 by Heney Baldwin, an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, a few months before his death in 1844.

==Parks and recreation==
Diamond Park is Meadville&#x27;s central park and has been used for a variety of different purposes for over two centuries. In the 19th century, the park was used as militia drill grounds leading up to and during the Civil War. After the Civil War was over, Diamond Park became more open to the public with grass, statues, monuments and a gazebo. It is now used as a recreational park for the community.

==Education==

===Colleges===
Meadville is the home of Allegheny College, a liberal arts college with approximately 1,700 students. Allegheny was founded in April 1815 by the Reverend Timothy Alden, a graduate of Harvard&#x27;s School of Divinity. The college was historically affiliated with the United Methodist Church after 1833, although it is currently non-sectarian. The first class, consisting of four male students, began their studies on July 4, 1816, without any formal academic buildings. Within six years, Alden accumulated sufficient funds to begin building a campus. The first building erected, the library, was designed by Alden himself, and is a notable example of early American architecture. Bentley Hall is named in honor of Dr. William Bentley, who donated his private library to the college, a collection of considerable value and significance. In 1824, Thomas Jefferson wrote to Alden, expressing the hope that his University of Virginia could someday possess the richness of Allegheny&#x27;s library. Alden served as president of the college until 1831, when financial and enrollment difficulties forced his resignation. Ruter Hall was built in 1853.

Meadville Theological School was established in 1844 by a wealthy businessman and Unitarian named Harm Jan Huidekoper. It moved to Chicago in 1926.

<doc id="132221" wikidata="Q106915" url="?curid=132221" title="Södermanland County">
<text>Södermanland County (, ) is a county or &quot;län&quot; on the southeast coast of Sweden. In the local Sörmlandic dialects it is virtually universally shortened and pronounced as Sörmlands län, or simply Sörmland, which is the dominant pronunciation and spelling inside the county. For example, the name of the local regional council is &quot;Region Sörmland&quot;. Södermanland&#x27;s capital is Nyköping and the largest settlement is Eskilstuna. In the sparsely populated interior, Katrineholm is the largest locality. In total, Södermanland has nine municipalities and about 300,000 inhabitants. 

Södermanland borders the counties of Östergötland, Örebro, Västmanland, Uppsala, Stockholm and to the Baltic Sea. It holds the popular camping route called &quot;Sörmlandsleden&quot; which is a system of trails covering a total of approximately 100 mil (1000 km) of walking paths in Södermanland. The county has shorelines on Sweden&#x27;s third and fourth largest lakes of Mälaren and Hjälmaren. There are also numerous large lakes in the Nyköpingsån river system through the west and centre of the county.

The Region Sörmland is an administrative unit, covering most of the province Södermanland. The eastern parts of the Södermanland province, largely corresponding to the Södertörn area, belong to Stockholm County. As a result of this long-standing divide, only areas inside the county are usually considered as Sörmlandic as opposed to a part of the extended Stockholm metropolitan area.

== Geography and climate ==
Södermanland runs between the lake Mälaren to the north and the Baltic Sea to its east and south. There is a large distance between the two main urban areas Eskilstuna and Nyköping of roughly , and vast forested areas in between. The centre of Södermanland is spread out between four municipality seats namely Vingåker, Katrineholm, Flen and Gnesta that separate the southern and northern areas of the county. Most parts are low-lying being part of the Mälar valley, but some higher areas can be found. The interior of Södermanland has many small rolling hills, courtesy of glacial rebound that has shaped the landscape of the area. The coastline on the Baltic Sea has many bays connected to it, with Nyköping being well-shielded from the open sea by a peninsula with plenty of inlets. Offshore there are also plenty of islets making up the Sörmlandic archipelago. The county has lake tripoints with Stockholm and Uppsala in Mälaren, with Västmanland and Örebro in Hjälmaren and a land tri-point with Örebro and Östergötland just south of Högsjö. The southwest of the county marks the southernmost points of the greater regions of Svealand and the Mälar valley.

The climate much like other parts of southern Sweden is a mix between oceanic and moderated continental. Summers highs are most often around , with lows around inland and either near or above on the coast due to the warm July sea surface temperatures. Winter highs differ between and between inland and coastal parts with lows around on the coast to inland and in the lakeside north. It can heavily fluctuate between different years with influences from different weather systems. Most often winters are still pronounced enough for the climate to be a clear four-season climate although the open sea most often remains ice-free year round.

== Politics ==
&quot;Region Sörmland&quot; is the name of the regional council of Södermanland, the county&#x27;s self-governing local authority.

As of 2019, the local government constellation consists of the Social Democrats, Vård för Pengarna and the Centre Party. The coalition holds a majority in the regional council with 42 seats out of 71 total.

<text>Flen Municipality (&quot;Flens kommun&quot;) is a municipality in central Södermanland County in southeast Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Flen.

The present municipality was formed in 1971 through the amalgamation of the &quot;City of Flen&quot; (instituted in 1949), the market town (&quot;köping&quot;) Malmköping and the surrounding countryside, including a southeastern portion of the former Oppunda hundred that was split between Flen and Nyköping municipalities. It also includes all of the former Villåttinge hundred.

==Geography==
Flen Municipality is a lowland inland municipality that falls to above sea level on the lakes of Långhalsen and Torpfjärden in the southeastern area. The highest peak is at on the tripoint between Flen, Gnesta and Strängnäs municipalities.

==Localities== 
Figures from Statistics Sweden, 2004.

*Flen 6,107
*Malmköping 2,006
*Hälleforsnäs 1,737
*Sparreholm 799
*Skebokvarn 225
*Mellösa 549
*Bettna 410
*Vadsbro 118

Of these places, Malmköping, located about 15 km north of Flen, surpasses Flen as a tourism attraction due to its two annual markets. The traditions of markets in Malmköping goes back centuries, as Malmköping got market town rights (became a &quot;köping&quot;) already in 1785.

==Elections==
The following results are since the 1972 municipal reform onwards.

===Riksdag===
==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Flen Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

Flen is a poor municipality by lower Svealand standards. As of 2022 it was a rather segregated municipality with very high levels of ethnic minority populations concentrated south of the railway, while people of Swedish background are in a sizeable majority in the outer parts of town and in the countryside. Every district was beneath the median income of its southern neighbour Nyköping. In total there were 16,271 inhabitants with 11,959 Swedish citizen adults eligible to vote. The political demographics were 50.4 % for the left bloc and 48.4 % for the right bloc, with the left dominating the town and the right sizeably winning the villages and countryside. No district reached 35% college graduates and unemployment was high throughout much of the municipality. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

<text>Gnesta Municipality (&quot;Gnesta kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Södermanland County in southeast Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Gnesta, with some 5,000 inhabitants.

It is in the middle of the cultural Södermanland province. Although it only has around 10,000 permanent inhabitants, the population increases substantially in the summer due to the many summer houses.

Industry-wise, Gnesta mostly has small companies with few employed. There are about 800 registered companies in the municipality, and a &quot;large&quot; company would have 25-50 employees.

<doc id="132225" wikidata="Q500267" url="?curid=132225" title="Nyköping Municipality">
<text>Nyköping Municipality () is a municipality in Södermanland County in southeast Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Nyköping, which is containing a majority of the residents. Its southern tip in the district of Tunaberg is the southernmost point of mainland Svealand, one of the three original crowns forming Sweden. Nyköping is the administrative capital of Södermanland and hosts both the governors&#x27; residence and the regional council.

The municipality was created in 1971 with the amalgamation of the &quot;City of Nyköping&quot; and a great number of other municipalities. It was split up in three parts in 1992, when Gnesta Municipality and Trosa Municipality were created. The rural areas of the modern municipality is a merger between the historical rural districts of Jönåker in the west and Rönö in the east, with a portion of the Jönåker hundred being replaced by the southeastern part of Oppunda. The village of Jönåker itself became part of the municipality as a result of the mergers. Politically, Nyköping is historically dominated by the Social Democrats, although margins between the coalitions have been closer in some recent elections. Employment has transformed from industry to more of a commuter and service town in recent decades.

Nyköping itself sits on an inlet and has a seasonal tourist port that often freezes in winter. The rural and rugged coastline is a distinct feature of the municipality. The local climate has four distinct seasons. Snow cover in winter is variable and by contrast, especially seaside summer nights are warm by Nordic standards. Nyköpingsån is the largest river running through the municipality, with its basin forming a lake district around the village of Vrena in the north with the lakes of Yngaren and Långhalsen dominating the landscape. The largest lake of the drainage basin is Båven somewhat further east. Kilaån and Svärtaån are the other sizeable river systems draining into the Baltic Sea within the municipality.

In the rural part of the municipality, the majority live in the many inland villages where Stigtomta is the largest. The largest population concentration outside of Nyköping proper is in the villages of the Kila river valley to the west of town, with a total of about 4,400 people in the three districts following the lowest course of the river. Elsewhere, the municipality is sparsely populated. Tystberga is the main village of the rural eastern parts and Nävekvarn the main settlement of the southern coast, with both being in relative isolation.

==Geography==

The following localities are large enough as in having more than 200 inhabitants to qualify under the Swedish definition of a locality. Many of these localities are former seats of rural municipalities.

* Nyköping (seat)
* Arnö (part of the Nyköping urban area)
* Bergshammar
* Buskhyttan
* Enstaberga
* Jönåker
* Nävekvarn
* Runtuna
* Sjösa
* Stavsjö
* Stigtomta
* Svalsta
* Vrena
* Tystberga
* Ålberga

Of those, only Buskhyttan, Nävekvarn and Sjösa are either onshore or near-coastal settlements, the rest being in the municipality&#x27;s interior. Nävekvarn is the only other settlement than Nyköping to maintain a harbour and a seaside environment.

In addition there are numerous smaller settlements not large enough to meet the classification. The most significant of those are Aspa, Bränn-Ekeby, Koppartorp, Lappetorp, Lid, Lästringe, Ripsa, Råby and Svärta. Seaside mixed residence/holiday home areas also include Hummelvik, Horn, Skeppsvik, Svärdsklova, Uttervik, and Örstig.

The western area of the rural part of the municipality is more densely populated than the eastern side, with Stigtomta and the tri-village conurbation of Bergshammar, Svalsta and Enstaberga being located on that side. Skavsta Airport is also located in this section of the municipality. In 2018, there were 8,699 Swedish citizens of voting age registered in rural electoral wards set west of National Road 53 that goes roughly through the centre of the municipality compared to only 4,362 east of the road. This meant that 2/3 of the rural populace was in the western portion of the municipality.

The majority of residents, however, are living in Nyköping&#x27;s urban area.

===Bodies of water===
Nyköping Municipality has a vast coastline on the Baltic Sea and several freshwater bodies. The two largest lakes are Yngaren and Båven, both connected to the sea through Nyköpingsån, a narrow river passing through Nyköping, entering through the lake of Långhalsen some north of town.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Nyköping Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total 57,507 people were residents, including 43,569 Swedish citizens of voting age. 50.6% voted for the left coalition and 48.1% for the right coalition. Of the 37 electoral districts, the median values were 82% employment, 85% Swedish background with 15% foreign background, a median income of 25,988 kronor and a college degree rate of 36%. With some of the largest districts having on average lower income, less employment, fewer college degree recipients and more people of foreign background, the averages would vary from said means. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Industry==
The municipality has 3,000 companies but more than 50% are sole traders. Only 80 have more than 25 employees; of those 33 have more than 50 employees.

A former military airfield in the municipality serves now as a civilian airport called Stockholm-Skavsta Airport.

==Education==
Nyköping is the site of the Nyköpings Gymnasium, formerly consisting of two schools: Gripen and Tessin as well as a smaller one located within the Stockholm-Skavsta Airport. Tessin was a high school noted for the strength of its curricula in humanities, arts, and social studies. Gripen was instead noted for the science and technical programs. The merger between the two organizations eventually led to an expanded Gripen being the sole public high school in the municipality.

==Tourist attraction==
Nyköpingshus, a medieval castle, draws many thousands of tourists yearly, especially for its summer outdoor play, &quot;Nyköpings gästabud&quot;, dramatizing 14th-century events in which king Birger Magnusson and Queen Märta invited his two brothers Valdemar and Erik to the castle, ostensibly for a banquet of reconciliation after a civil war in which Valdemar and Erik had once imprisoned Birger. During the banquet at Nyköpingshus, Birger arrested Valdemar and Erik and committed them to the dungeon, where, according to legend, they starved to death. Shortly thereafter supporters of Valdemar and Erik forced Birger and Märta to flee to Denmark.

===Riksdag elections===

Only parties that have won representation during this timeframe are listed in results.

Sweden Democrats have their results from 1988 to 1998 listed as &quot;0.0&quot; even though those were decimals higher, since the SCB did not publish those results in detail at a municipal level since the party was not in realistic contention to enter the Riksdag. From 1991 Trosa Municipality and Gnesta Municipality had separate elections rending significant boundary changes.

<text>Oxelösund Municipality (&quot;Oxelösunds kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Södermanland County in southeast Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Oxelösund.

In 1950 the &quot;Nikolai Rural municipality&quot; was dissolved. One part formed the then &quot;City of Oxelösund&quot;, one of the last newly created cities of Sweden. The rest of Nikolai was incorporated into the neighbouring &quot;City of Nyköping&quot;. In 1971 the city became a unitary municipality without addition of territory.

Still marked by its industrial past, the politics was historically dominated by the Social Democratic Party, and the industry by the harbour and iron works.

==Geography==
It covers a peninsula in the Baltic Sea, and borders by land only on Nyköping Municipality. With an area of , it is one of Sweden&#x27;s smallest municipalities.

==Elections since the 1972 municipal reform==

===Riksdag===
No boundary changes. The Sweden Democrats&#x27; numbers were not listed by the SCB agency from 1988 to 1998 due to the party being out of contention for Riksdag entry.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Oxelösund Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

There is a strong income disparity between the four districts on the southern shore and the other three downtown districts. In comparison, the wealthier districts would all be among the upper-half earners in the more affluent Nyköping Municipality, while the lower three would be right near the bottom. In total there were 12,125 inhabitants with 9,072 Swedish citizens of voting age. The political demographics were 52.5% for the left bloc and 45.4% for the right bloc. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==International relations==
===Twin towns - Sister cities===

Oxelösund is a member of the Douzelage, a unique town twinning association of 24 towns across the European Union. This active town twinning began in 1991 and there are regular events, such as a produce market from each of the other countries and festivals. Discussions regarding membership are also in hand with three further towns (Agros in Cyprus, Škofja Loka in Slovenia, and Tryavna in Bulgaria).

<text>Trosa Municipality (&quot;Trosa kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Södermanland County in southeast Sweden. The municipality consists of the localities of Vagnhärad, Västerljung, Stensund, Sund and the town of Trosa. The seat of the municipality is located in the town of Trosa.

The present municipality was created as recently as 1992, when Nyköping Municipality, which Trosa had been a part of since 1974, was split in three parts.

The municipality borders to Nyköping Municipality, Gnesta Municipality, and in the north to Södertälje Municipality in Stockholm County.

==Tourism==
During the summer, the municipality sees its population of 14´000 (2021) increase fourfold. This is mostly due to people living in the Stockholm area that, during the summer, move to their holiday cottages in the municipality. Being close to Stockholm, the municipality is a favourite amongst tourists from abroad. The well-equipped harbour and Trosa&#x27;s archipelago also attract many pleasure boats from both Sweden and the other countries bordering the Baltic Sea.  

==Elections==

The table below shows the results of the parliamentary (Riksdag) elections for Trosa municipality since the inaugural election under its current entity in 1991. For the period 1991 to 1998, the exact numbers of the Sweden Democrats were not published by the SCB due to the party&#x27;s small size nationally.

===Riksdag===
Political blocks

The table below lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocks since 1991. Parties not elected to the Riksdag are included in &quot;others&quot; such as the Sweden Democrats (results from 1988 to 2006) and the Greens (1991). The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. The New Democracy party got elected in 1991 but are still listed under &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party.

<text>James Robert Davis (born July 28, 1945) is an American cartoonist, screenwriter, and producer. He is best known as the creator of the comic strips &quot;Garfield&quot; and &quot;U.S. Acres&quot;. Published since 1978, &quot;Garfield&quot; is one of the world&#x27;s most widely syndicated comic strips. Davis&#x27;s other comics work includes &quot;Tumbleweeds&quot;, &quot;Gnorm Gnat&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Potato Head&quot;.

Davis wrote or co-wrote all of the &quot;Garfield&quot; TV specials for CBS, originally broadcast between 1982 and 1991. He also produced &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;, a series which also aired on CBS from 1988 to 1994. Davis was the writer and executive producer for a series of CGI direct-to-video feature films about Garfield, as well as an executive producer for the CGI animated TV series &quot;The Garfield Show&quot; and &quot;Garfield Originals&quot;.

==Early and personal life==

James Robert Davis was born in Marion, Indiana, on July 28, 1945. He grew up on a small Black Angus cow farm in Fairmount, Indiana, with his father James William Davis, mother Anna Catherine &quot;Betty&quot; Davis (née Carter), and his brother Dave. Davis&#x27;s childhood on a farm parallels the life of Garfield&#x27;s owner, Jon Arbuckle, who was also raised on a farm with his parents and a brother, Doc Boy, and is also a cartoonist whose birthday is on July 28. Davis attended Ball State University where he studied art and business; one of his fellow students was David Letterman. At Ball State he became a member of the Theta Xi fraternity.

At Fairmount High School in 1959, Davis joined the staff of his school&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The Breeze&quot;, where he became Art Editor. Here his first comic was featured, apparently inspired by school life. Davis also drew the majority of the illustrations for his 1963 senior yearbook, using the same characters.

Davis has been married twice. He was married to Carolyn Altekruse, who was allergic to cats; the couple owned a dog named Molly. They have a son. On July 16, 2000, Davis married Jill, who had two children from a previous marriage.

Davis joined the faculty of Ball State University in Muncie as an adjunct professor in fall 2006, lecturing on the creative and business aspects of the comics industry.

Davis resides in Albany, Indiana, where he and his staff produce &quot;Garfield&quot; under his company Paws, Inc., which he founded in 1981. Paws, Inc. employs nearly 50 artists and licensing administrators, who manage &quot;Garfield&quot;&#x27;s worldwide licensing, syndication, and entertainment empire.

Davis is a former president of the Fairmount, Indiana chapter of the FFA.

In December 2019, Davis announced that he would hold weekly auctions for all hand-painted &quot;Garfield&quot; comics made from 1978 to 2011. He explained that he started drawing comics digitally using a graphics tablet in 2011. Older comics remained sealed in a climate-controlled safe, and Davis had to figure out what to do with them.

==Career==
Before creating Garfield, Davis worked for an advertising agency. In 1969, he began assisting Tom Ryan on &quot;Tumbleweeds&quot;. He then created his own comic strip, &quot;Gnorm Gnat&quot;, that ran weekly from 1973 to 1975 in &quot;The Pendleton Times&quot;. When Davis tried to sell it to a national comic strip syndicate, an editor told him: &quot;Your art is good, your &#x27;gags&#x27; are &#x27;great&#x27;, but bugs—nobody can relate to bugs!&quot; He then began studying the comic strips; still believing that animals were funny, he noticed in &quot;Peanuts&quot; that Snoopy was not only a scene stealer but was a far greater marketing success Charlie Brown. Believing that the comic market was oversaturated with dogs, he decided instead to create a cat as a main character for his next strip.

From January 1976 to February 1978, Davis published a weekly strip titled &quot;Jon&quot; in &quot;The Pendleton Times&quot;, starring the young bachelor Jon Arbuckle and his lethargic, cynical housecat Garfield; the latter&#x27;s increasing popularity among both editors and readers led Davis to rename the strip &quot;Garfield&quot; on September 1, 1977. &quot;Garfield&quot; began syndication in 41 newspapers on June 19, 1978. As of 2008, it appeared in 2,580 newspapers and was read by 300 million readers every day.

In March 1986, Davis launched the barnyard comic strip &quot;U.S. Acres&quot;, known outside the U.S. as &quot;Orson&#x27;s Farm&quot;. It failed to match the success of &quot;Garfield&quot;, and was concluded on May 1, 1989; Davis&#x27; assistant Brett Koth was credited as a co-artist during its final year. From 2000 to 2003, Davis and Koth created a strip based on the Mr. Potato Head toy.

Davis founded the Professor Garfield Foundation to support children&#x27;s literacy.

His influences include Mort Walker&#x27;s &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; and &quot;Hi and Lois&quot;, Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot;, Milton Caniff&#x27;s &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; and Johnny Hart&#x27;s &quot;B.C&quot;.

From 1984 to 2001, Davis owned a fine-dining restaurant in Muncie called Foxfires. He closed it after its head chef was hired elsewhere.

In 2019, Davis sold Paws, Inc. to the mass media conglomerate Viacom, which months later merged with CBS Corporation to form ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global).

In 2019, Davis offered more than 11,000 hand-drawn &quot;Garfield&quot; comic strips from 1978 to 2011 for auction by Heritage Auctions, at the rate of two daily strips a week.

<text>Titusville is a city in the far eastern corner of Crawford County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 5,262 at the 2020 census. Titusville is known as the birthplace of the American oil industry and for a number of years was the leading oil-producing region in the world. It was also notable for its lumber industry, including 17 sawmills, as well as its plastic and toolmaking industries. It is part of the Meadville micropolitan area.

== History ==

The area was first settled in 1796 by Jonathan Titus. Within 14 years, others bought and improved land lying near his, along the banks of what is now Oil Creek. Titus named the village Edinburg(h), but as it grew, the settlers began to call the hamlet Titusville. The village was incorporated as a borough in 1849. It was a slow-growing community until the 1850s, when petroleum was discovered in the region.

Oil was known to exist there, but there was no practical way to extract it. Its main use at that time had been as a medicine for both animals and humans. In the late 1850s, the Seneca Oil Company (formerly the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company) sent Col. Edwin L. Drake to start drilling on a piece of leased land just south of Titusville, near what is now Oil Creek State Park. In the summer of 1859, Drake hired a salt well driller, William A. Smith. They had many difficulties, but on August 27, at the site of an oil spring just south of Titusville, they finally drilled a well that could be commercially successful.

Teamsters were needed immediately to transport the oil to markets. In 1862, the Oil Creek &amp; Titusville Railroad was built between Titusville and Corry, where the product was transferred to larger east-west railroad lines. In 1865, pipelines were laid directly to the line and the demand for teamsters practically ended. The next year the railroad line was extended south to Petroleum Centre and Oil City. The Union &amp; Titusville Railroad was built in 1865. That line became part of the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad in 1871. That fall, President Ulysses S. Grant visited Titusville to view the important region.

Other oil-related businesses were quickly established. Eight refineries were built between 1862 and 1868. Drilling tools were needed and several iron works were built. Titusville grew from 250 residents to 10,000 almost overnight and in 1866, it incorporated as a city. In 1871, the first oil exchange in the United States was established there. The exchange moved from the city, but returned in 1881 in a new, brick building, before being dissolved in 1897.

The first oil millionaire was Jonathan Watson, a resident of Titusville. He owned the land where Drake&#x27;s well was drilled. He had been a partner in a lumber business prior to the success of the well. At one time it was said that Titusville had more millionaires per capita than anywhere else in the world.

One resident of note was Franklin S. Tarbell, whose large Italianate home still stands. He first moved a few miles south in Venango County and established a wooden stock tank business. About south-east of Titusville was another oil boom city, Pithole. Oil was discovered in a rolling meadow there in January 1865 and, by September 1865, the population was 15,000. But the oil soon ran dry and within four years the city was nearly deserted. Tarbell moved to Titusville in 1870. His daughter, Ida Minerva Tarbell, grew up amidst the sounds and smells of the oil industry. She became an accomplished writer and published a series of articles about the business practices of the Standard Oil Company and its president, John D. Rockefeller, which sparked legislative action in Congress concerning monopolies.

Fire was always a significant concern around oil and one of the worst blazes was on June 11, 1880. It came to be known as &quot;Black Friday&quot;, when almost of oil burned after an oil tank was hit by lightning. The fire raged for three days until it finally was brought under control. The destroyed oil was valued at $2 million, but there was no loss of life. Another fire occurred on June 5, 1892, when Oil Creek flooded and a tank of petroleum ether overturned. The petroleum ether ignited and, in the ensuing explosions, 60 men, women and children died. Another lightning strike in 1894 resulted in of oil being lost in a fire.

Oil production in Pennsylvania peaked in 1891, after which other industries became established in Titusville. The iron and steel industries dominated the town in the early twentieth century, with lumber eventually reclaiming its former pre-eminence. Oil still has some relevance, however. Charter Plastics, now located in a building that once manufactured pressure vessels, stationary engines and boilers for the oil industry, uses oil in its production processes.

<text>Värmland County () is a county or &quot;län&quot; in west central Sweden. It borders the Swedish counties of Dalarna, Örebro and Västra Götaland, as well as the Norwegian counties of Østfold, Akershus and Innlandet to the west. The title of Duke of Värmland is claimed by His Royal Highness Prince Carl Philip.

== Province ==
The county has more or less the same boundaries as Värmland Province, except that the municipalities of Karlskoga and Degerfors are part of Örebro County.

== Administration ==

Värmland County was formed in 1779, when it was separated from Närke and Värmland County.

The main aim of the County Administrative Board is to fulfil the goals set in national politics by the Riksdag and the Government, to coordinate the interests of the county, to promote the development of the county, to establish regional goals and safeguard the due process of law in the handling of each case. The County Administrative Board is a Government Agency headed by a Governor. See List of Värmland Governors.

== Politics ==

The County Council of Värmland is called &quot;Region Värmland&quot;.

== Riksdag elections ==
The table details all Riksdag election results of Värmland County since the unicameral era began in 1970. The blocs denote which party would support the Prime Minister or the lead opposition party towards the end of the elected parliament.

== Municipalities ==

*Arvika
*Eda
*Filipstad
*Forshaga
*Grums
*Hagfors
*Hammarö
*Karlstad
*Kil
*Kristinehamn
*Munkfors
*Storfors
*Sunne
*Säffle
*Torsby
*Årjäng

== Demographics ==

=== Foreign background ===
SCB have collected statistics on backgrounds of residents since 2002. These tables consist of all who have two foreign-born parents or are born abroad themselves. The chart lists election years and the last year on record alone.


==Climate==
Värmland being a landlocked county results in greater temperature differences than at the nearby west coast of Sweden and south coast of Norway. As a result, the southern areas of the county has a humid continental climate with strong oceanic influences. The latter climate type is prevalent in a small area at the shores of Lake Vänern due to recent warming. More northerly areas see a subarctic climate with relatively mild winters for the climate type. The subarctic classification of areas such as Hagfors and Torsby is more due to the cool summer nights that renders September below in mean temperatures.



== Heraldry ==
The county of Värmland inherited its coat of arms from the province of the same name. When it is shown with a royal crown it represents the County Administrative Board. Blazon: &quot;Argent, an Eagle displayed Azure beaked, langued and membered Gules.&quot;

<text>Grums Municipality (&quot;Grums kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Värmland County in west central Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Grums, with about 5,200 inhabitants.

As so many of the municipalities of Sweden the present entity was created in 1971. The market town (&quot;köping&quot;) Grums (instituted as such in 1948) was amalgamated with Ed and the parish Värmskog from the dissolved Stavnäs Municipality, thus forming Grums Municipality.

Geographically it is situated on the north-west shore of Lake Vänern in the province of Värmland. Transportations are reliable with the European route E18 intersecting the town.

Historically the town was the center of the historical jurisdiction Grums Hundred, with its oldest seal stemming from 1617. The seal showed an accurate image of the local church.

The coat of arms is derived from that of the hundred. It also depicts three saw-blades, symbolizing the forest industry.

The local political party is known as Grums medborgarparti, abbreviated &quot;gm&quot;. It was founded in 1994, in the wake of the short-lived unconventional party Ny Demokrati. The party was the municipality&#x27;s third largest in the election of 1994 and 1998.

<text>Karlstad Municipality () is a municipality in Värmland County in west central Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Karlstad.

The present municipality was established in 1971 when the former City of Karlstad was amalgamated with a number of surrounding rural municipalities.

==Localities==
*Alster
*Blombacka
*Karlstad (seat)
*Killstad
*Molkom
*Skattkärr
*Skåre
*Slängserud
*Vallargärdet
*Väse

==Politics==
Municipalities are responsible for government-mandated duties, and elections for the Municipal council are held every four years, parallel to the general elections.

Until the 2010s inhabitants of Karlstad had a tendency to vote close to the national results at the general elections, making it the generally accepted bellwether town of Sweden. In 2022 this had decisively changed, with the winning right coalition performing seven points better overall than it did in Karlstad, with the bellwether municipalities instead being previous Social Democrats-dominated post-industrial towns in Bergslagen a bit northeast of Karlstad.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Karlstad Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 95,290 residents, including 74,827 Swedish citizens of voting age. 52.5% voted for the left coalition and 46.4% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Elections==

===Riksdag===
These are the local results of the Riksdag elections since the 1972 municipality reform. The results of the Sweden Democrats were not published by SCB between 1988 and 1998 at a municipal level to the party&#x27;s small nationwide size at the time. &quot;Votes&quot; denotes valid votes, whereas &quot;Turnout&quot; denotes also blank and invalid votes.

Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party. &quot;Elected&quot; is the total number of percentage points from the municipality that went to parties who were elected to the Riksdag.

==Notable natives==
*Bengt Alsterlind, TV host (&quot;Hajk&quot;)
*Zarah Leander, singer
*Sven-Erik Magnusson, singer/dance band artist (Sven-Ingvars)
*Christer Sjögren, rock/dansband singer (Vikingarna)
*Ulf Sterner, ice hockey player (first Swede to play in the National Hockey League)
*Fabian Zetterlund, ice hockey forward for the San Jose Sharks
*Elgen Helge, local hero (Most handsome moose around)

<text>Boiling Springs is a census-designated place (CDP) in South Middleton Township, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, and is part of the Harrisburg–Carlisle metropolitan statistical area. The population was 3,225 at the 2010 census, up from 2,769 at the 2000 census.

==Hydrogeology==
Boiling Springs is located on the eastern side of South Middleton Township at , on the north side of Yellow Breeches Creek. Pennsylvania Route 174 passes through the town as 1st Street and leads northeast to Mechanicsburg and west to Shippensburg. Carlisle, the Cumberland County seat, is to the northwest via Front Street/Forge Road.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Boiling Springs has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.49%, is water.

Boiling Springs gets its name from the natural artesian well springs located in and around the town. Boiling Springs ranks seventh in size of springs in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The largest of these springs named &quot;the Bubble&quot; is a 2nd magnitude spring based on its average discharge of around 0.7 cubic meters per second. About of water flows per day from a total of 30 springs dotted across approximately .

The impression of &quot;boiling&quot; does not result from the temperature of the water, which stays at year-round, but rather from a unique hydrogeological feature. Two vertical diabase dikes, made up of highly impermeable igneous basalt parent rock, cut through the limestone bedrock in the area and form a subterranean &quot;V&quot;, with Boiling Springs located at the interior tip of the V.

The dikes were formed around 200 million years ago, during the late Triassic and early Jurassic periods, when Pangaea broke apart: the same period of geological activity that formed the Palisades Sill. What is now eastern North America began to separate from what is now north-western Africa. Deep faults formed in the Earth&#x27;s crust as the continental sections pulled apart. Magma was generated through decompression melting, and this molten rock pushed up to fill the faults. The cooler temperatures of the upper crust quickly solidified the hot rock, preventing it from reaching the surface. This geological process created large, thin, subvertical sheets of impermeable basalt, or diabase dikes.

When precipitation flows down South Mountain, a large amount of groundwater is produced. Much of the water, which has an acidic pH, is able to erode the valley&#x27;s limestone bedrock and continue flowing at about below the soil. However, some of the water is trapped by the impermeable diabase dikes, which act as a hydrologic barrier. The water becomes progressively confined by the dikes as it nears the tip of the &quot;V&quot;. Due to the positive pressure created by this confinement, water is pushed up to the surface and out of the artesian aquifer, giving the impression of &quot;boiling&quot; springs. The springs have a median flow of per minute. These springs, collectively known as a &quot;spring swarm&quot; discharge 5 to 7 times the expected infiltration given its topographic watershed. Data collected via the use of highly precise and accurate data loggers have revealed the springs hydrograph to display discharge surges, while temperature, conductivity, and turbidity remain constant. Water temperature varies seasonally by 0.3 °C but is 6 months out of phase with air temperature. A new model that has been proposed to account for these findings suggests that the excess water emanating from the springs originates from an area 60 km to the southeast on the southern side of South Mountain near the West Conewago Creek, Lat 40`04&#x27;56&quot;, long 76`43&#x27;13&quot;.

One of the most prominent springs in this area is called the &quot;Bubble&quot;. It is located directly behind the Boiling Springs Tavern, at the intersection of 1st Street and Front Street. The name of the Boiling Springs High School mascot, &quot;The Bubblers&quot;, was inspired by this spring.

==Children&#x27;s Lake==

This body of water was formed by partially damming the brook fed from 30 natural springs, including the &quot;Bubble&quot;. Children&#x27;s Lake is home to many ducks, swans, and geese throughout the year. The lake dates to the 1750s when the dam was used to provide water power for iron production. In the mid-18th century, a grist mill was built by Michael Ege on the southeast shore of the lake, to provide flour and grain for the iron works. This building has been converted into apartments. On January 29, 2022, a fire occurred and caused significant damage to the mill building. The building is slated to be converted 
On the east shore, remaining from the pre-revolutionary iron forge complex, are the original forge and the iron master&#x27;s mansion with the remnants of its terraced gardens. This 1795 Georgian structure is the most outstanding example of architecture in the Boiling Springs Historic District and of major historical significance as the home of the Ege family.

The lake feeds into Yellow Breeches Creek. A picturesque, natural stone three-arch bridge, built in 1854, stands behind the mill, spanning the creek. This limestone trout stream has developed a national reputation for fly fishing. Where Children&#x27;s Lake runs into the Yellow Breeches, a one-mile stretch of water known as &quot;The Junction&quot; provides quality catch-and-release fishing year round. This is arguably the most intensely fished section of water in Pennsylvania when the White Mayfly hatches. Limestone bedrock streams are rich in minerals, which serve as the basis for the trout&#x27;s food chain and contribute to healthy growth rates for trout.

==Appalachian Trail==

Boiling Springs and South Middleton Township, which are near the halfway point of the Appalachian Trail, were designated Pennsylvania&#x27;s first Appalachian Trail Community. In 2010, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy started recognizing towns near the trail that are assets to hikers and the trail. As of 2012, Boiling Springs is one of 23 designated Appalachian Trail Communities. The Mid-Atlantic Regional Office of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy is located at 4 East First Street in Boiling Springs, sharing space with the Boiling Springs Appalachian Trail Information Center. As one of only four regional offices along the trail, the staff covers New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia south through Shenandoah National Park. It is the only Appalachian Trail Conservancy office that is located on the famous footpath itself.

Several hundred hikers pass through every week during the busy seasons. Hikers often mail themselves packages to pick up at the Boiling Springs Post Office, which is just feet from the trail. The Boiling Springs Pool offers hikers a shower for $1, and there are several bed and breakfasts, a nearby campground and even a resident who lets hikers sleep in the backyard. Nearby Allenberry Resort Inn and Playhouse rents rooms to hikers for a reasonable rate.

==History==

Boiling Springs was settled by Europeans prior to 1737.

The springs were partially dammed in the 1750s to provide water power for iron production, with raw materials of iron ore, timber and limestone plentiful in the neighboring mountains. The Carlisle Iron Works was in full production by the 1760s, and a grist mill was built at the end of the lake in 1762. While the foundry&#x27;s iron was probably used to make ammunition and weapons for the Continental Army, no cannons were made.

Daniel Kaufman, who laid out the village of Boiling Springs in 1845, purchased from his father, Abraham, in 1843. He built his 301 Front Street home in 1880.

Kaufman and Boiling Springs played a role in the Underground Railroad. Kaufman was an Underground Railroad agent from 1835 to 1847. The Underground Railroad asked him to set up a necessary stopover between Shippensburg and Harrisburg. Kaufman provided food and transportation to fugitive slaves passing through the area; his barn and a densely wooded area nearby served as shelter. Kaufman was sued by a Maryland slave owner in 1847 and convicted in Cumberland County, but the verdict was overturned by the state Supreme Court. He was then charged in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia and convicted. He was ultimately fined $4,000 (~$ in ) in 1852, in a case that drew wide attention.

Boiling Springs is now part of the Network to Freedom, a series of noteworthy sites along the Underground Railroad.

The area around the lake was a recreation spot as early as 1875 when a steam launch began to operate to carry picnickers down the mill race to Island Grove, on Yellow Breeches Creek. In 1895, trolley car lines were added running from Carlisle and Harrisburg. The Valley Traction Company leased the lake in 1900 and built a park as a destination for passengers on their trolleys. Boiling Springs became a resort community, with travelers coming to picnic and boat on the lake, with such park attractions as a dance pavilion, picnic pavilion, miniature steam railway and a merry-go-round. The trolley was operated until around 1930.

The Boiling Springs Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

Episode #13 of the second season of the classic TV series &quot;Route 66&quot; was set in and filmed in Boiling Springs. The episode was titled &quot;Burning for Burning&quot; and was first aired on December 29, 1961.

==Entertainment==
Recreation continues to bring people to Boiling Springs, ranging from fly-fishing on Yellow Breeches Creek to theater, dining and lodging at Allenberry Resort, which opened in the summer of 1946. Allenberry Playhouse, whose season runs more than 40 weeks - from March to December - produced its first stage performance in 1949. The Boiling Springs Tavern, previously a restaurant in downtown Boiling Springs, was a popular dining destination. Parts of the tavern, which is located along an old stagecoach route, date to 1832. In 2020, during the pandemic, the Tavern was closed, and remains in that state.

Boiling Springs has an annual juried arts and crafts show, called &quot;Foundry Day&quot;, on the first Saturday in June. The booths and food vendors stretch down Front Street, next to Children&#x27;s Lake. 
The annual Carlisle Summerfair Festival&#x27;s &quot;Anything Floats&quot; event is held on the 4th of July. Teams create their own vessel and then paddle the boat from one end of Children&#x27;s Lake (near the Boiling Springs Tavern) to the other end (near the Grist Mill and the Boiling Springs Pool).

The Boiling Springs Pool was built in 1927 by Gilbert Malcolm, husband of Helen Bucher. It was the first public swimming facility in Cumberland County and remains open to the public. The facility offers four pools and three waterslides as well as a full-service snackbar.

<text>Kil Municipality (&quot;Kils kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Värmland County in west central Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Kil.

The local government reform of 1971 amalgamated Stora Kil, Järnskog and a part of Brunskog, thus forming Kil Municipality.

Kil means wedge, crack or similar in Swedish, in this case referring to a bay (old Swedish). The name is at least from the fifteenth century, referring to a bay by the small lake Hyn, where the church was constructed. The town later became the seat of the juridical Kil Hundred, which is known to have existed in 1426. The wedge is noted in the coat of arms.

The town is notable as the location of Sweden&#x27;s first railroad in 1849.

<text>Kristinehamn Municipality (&quot;Kristinehamns kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Värmland County in west central Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Kristinehamn.

The present municipality was created in 1971 when the former City of Kristinehamn was merged with parts of the two dissolved rural municipalities Visnum and Väse.

==Localities==
*Kristinehamn (seat)
*Björneborg
*Bäckhammar
*Ölme

==Sites of interest==
*The medieval island of Saxholmen, situated in the beautiful archipelago of Kristinehamn. There have been several archaeological excavations on the island during the past few years. There is a myth that once the cruel and hateful Saxe av Sachsen lived on the island with his wife and servants. His wife took off with her lover.
*Östervik chapel is a unique small church which has a fascinating history and architecture.
*Folk museum, the red-painted houses made of wood, the rushing of the water, and the bleating of the sheep make altogether a wonderful atmosphere and give you a memorable visit. Lundbomsgården is a middle-class home from the 19th century, the mill from the early 17th century.
*Värmlands Säby manor house has typical 18th century qualities with beautiful tiled stoves and painted tapestries. There is also a unique hedge maze consisting of 1,747 bushes.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Kristinehamn Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 24,083 residents, including 18,945 Swedish citizens of voting age. 51.2% voted for the left coalition and 47.7% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Elections==
These are the results of the elections in the municipality since the first election after the municipal reform, being held in 1973. The exact results of Sweden Democrats were not listed at a municipal level by SCB from 1988 to 1998 due to the party&#x27;s small size at the time. &quot;Turnout&quot; denotes the percentage of eligible people casting any ballots, whereas &quot;Votes&quot; denotes the number of valid votes only.

===Riksdag===
Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party.

==International relations==

===Twin towns — Sister cities===

The municipality is twinned with:

* Brodnica, Poland (since 2003)
* Elva, Estonia (since 1992)
* Farsund, Norway (since 1945)
* Rautavaara, Finland (since 1971)

== History ==
The name &quot;Camp Hill&quot; is believed to stem from a split in the congregation of a Peace Church, located west of the current borough. One faction of the church began meeting outdoors, on a hill. Prior to the Civil War, the area was known locally as White Hill, and was a stop along the Cumberland Valley Railroad between Harrisburg and Carlisle. During the Civil War, the Battle of Sporting Hill became the northernmost engagement of the Gettysburg Campaign, which took place at Camp Hill in late June 1863. Camp Hill was incorporated as a borough on November 10, 1885, from East Pennsboro Township. The Peace Church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

<text>Munkfors Municipality (&quot;Munkfors kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Värmland County in west central Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Munkfors.

In 1952 the rural municipality Ransäter got the title of a market town (&quot;köping&quot;) and the name Munkfors after its only built-up locality. With the local government reform of 1971 it became a municipality of unitary type without addition of territory. The municipality is today the 9th smallest by population in Sweden.

In Ransäter lies the Geijer School, in honour of author Erik Gustaf Geijer (1783-1843), who was born at the Ransäter farm. A second notable Ransäter native was Tage Erlander (1901-1985), who was Prime Minister of Sweden 1946-1969.

The municipality has one sister city: Lindsborg, Kansas, U.S.A.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Munkfors Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 3,679 residents, including 2,714 Swedish citizens of voting age. 56.8% voted for the left coalition and 42.0% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Elections==

===Riksdag===
These are the local results of the Riksdag elections since the 1972 municipality reform. The results of the Sweden Democrats were not published by SCB between 1988 and 1998 at a municipal level to the party&#x27;s small nationwide size at the time. &quot;Votes&quot; denotes valid votes, whereas &quot;Turnout&quot; denotes also blank and invalid votes.

Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party. &quot;Elected&quot; is the total number of percentage points from the municipality that went to parties who were elected to the Riksdag.

<text>Säffle Municipality (&quot;Säffle kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Värmland County in west central Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Säffle.

Säffle was the last local government unit in Sweden to get the title of a city, in 1951. In 1952 the system with different types of municipalities was made obsolete, but it formally existed until 1971. The present municipality was created in that year, when the city was amalgamated with the surrounding rural municipalities.

The municipality covers a peninsula in Lake Vänern (Värmlandsnäs), and has a large fresh water archipelago.

==Värmlandsnäs==
Värmlandsnäs, also called Näset, is a big and important part of the municipality. The area which reaches out into the middle of Lake Vänern as a big peninsula is very significant to the economy by the produce of pork. The area supplies more than 200,000 people with pork.

Näset also has an archipelago on the east side. The boat people talk very well of Millesvik Archipelago (&quot;Millesviks skärgård&quot;), which also has a lot of old runestones and other ancient monuments.

From Ekenäs harbor you can take the tourist boat to Lurö, a small island in Lake Vänern. At Lurö you can dine and stay over night.

Many people who visit Värmlandsnäs in the summer wants to take a swim in Lake Vänern. The opportunities are plenty and good. At Ekenäs you will find a very nice bathing place. From this place you can almost walk all the way out to Lurö. Other popular bathing places are Ekôrn and the bathing place at Örud near Örö harbor (&quot;Örö hamn&quot;).

<text>Torsby Municipality (&quot;Torsby kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Värmland County in west central Sweden, bordering Norway. Its seat is located in the town of Torsby.

The name &quot;Torsby&quot; means Thor&#x27;s village.

The present municipality consists of eight original local government entities (as of 1863): Dalby, Fryksände, Lekvattnet, Norra Finnskoga, Norra Ny, Nyskoga, Södra Finnskoga, Vitsand and Östmark. In 1952 they were grouped into four larger units and in 1974 they were all united.

There is much Finnish heritage in Torsby Municipality.

==Localities==

Population centers in the municipality include:
* Ambjörby
* Oleby
* Östmark
* Stöllet
* Sysslebäck
* Torsby (seat)

==Transportation==
Torsby is the end station on the Fryksdal branchline from Karlstad via Kil. There is a small airport with scheduled flights to Stockholm, whilst the nearest international airport is Gardermoen in Norway. The road, &quot;E45&quot;, passes through the municipality.

==Sport==
Sven-Göran Eriksson and Marcus Berg have their roots in Torsby.

The municipality has a number of skiing centres for both alpine skiing (Hovfjället and Branäs) and cross-country skiing (Mattila and Långberget). A cross-country ski tunnel, which is also the world&#x27;s longest, opened on June 16, 2006.

Stjerneskolan, a senior high school, specializes in cross-country skiing and biathlon. The most famous former pupil is Gunde Svan. Carl Johan Bergman, who was born in Ekshärad, also studied there for a year.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Torsby Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 11,448 inhabitants, with 8,766 Swedish citizens of voting age. 44.9% voted for the left coalition and 53.9% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Elections==

===Riksdag===
These are the local results of the Riksdag elections since the 1972 municipality reform. The results of the Sweden Democrats were not published by SCB between 1988 and 1998 at a municipal level to the party&#x27;s small nationwide size at the time. &quot;Votes&quot; denotes valid votes, whereas &quot;Turnout&quot; denotes also blank and invalid votes.

Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party.

<text>Bjurholm Municipality () is a municipality in Västerbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Bjurholm.

The present municipality has the same territory as the one instituted in 1863, when the municipal system was implemented in Sweden. Between 1974 and 1983 it was, however, part of Vännäs Municipality. The split in 1983 made Bjurholm the least populated of all Swedish municipalities, and the population is still decreasing.

<text>Lycksele Municipality (; ; ) is a municipality in Västerbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Lycksele and the municipality is located in the southern parts of Swedish Lapland.

The municipality traces its history to Lycksele parish, which was in effect during the 19th century with very similar borders and size (5,000-5,500 km²). The whole rural municipality Lycksele became a market town (&quot;köping&quot;) in 1929 and city in 1946. In 1971 it was amalgamated with Örträsk Municipality.

Generally the northern municipalities, already sparsely populated, have population decreases, but various supporting projects also exist. For instance, a campus of Umeå University is situated here.

==Localities==
There are two localities (or urban areas) in Lycksele Municipality:

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Lycksele Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 12,255 residents, including 9,233 Swedish citizens of voting age. 53.2% voted for the left coalition and 46.0% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Transport==
There is an airport just south of Lycksele, from which one can reach Stockholm in about 80 minutes.

Previously, the railroad between Umeå and Storuman was the main means of transportation, but its significance has diminished and passenger traffic was discontinued. There are now daily buses to towns like Umeå, Storuman and Tärnaby. In August 2011, passenger train services between Lycksele and Umeå were re-established.

The European route E12, also known as &quot;Blå vägen&quot; (&quot;The Blue Road&quot;) winds along the Ume River and passes through Lycksele.

==Sister cities==
Lycksele Municipality has three sister cities:

* Mosjøen, Norway
* Ähtäri, Finland
* Lovozero, Russia

Norsjö has traditionally been a major industrial municipality. The vast forests in the area have been the basis for many wood-based industrial sectors, including forest management, forest harvesting and replanting, timber transport, saw mills, manufactured products from wood, and wood as a renewable fuel for electrical and heat energy production.

A significant amount of renewable energy is produced in Norsjö Municipality, including electrical energy from hydropower stations and wood-based heat energy for industrial and household heating applications.

Metallic ore mining has also been a very prominent industrial factor over the years, with a number of mines operating in and around Norsjö Municipality which is in the Skellefteå Field mining district. Norsjö Municipality is only 50 km from the large regional mineral processing plant in nearby Boliden.

<text>Skellefteå Municipality () is a municipality in Västerbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Skellefteå.

==History==
Most of the amalgamations leading to the present municipality took place in 1967 when the then &quot;City of Skellefteå&quot; was merged with the rural municipality by the same name and also with the municipalities Jörn, Bureå and Byske. The enlarged city became a municipality of unitary type with the new local government act in 1971, and in 1974 the municipalities Burträsk and Lövånger were added.

==Geography==
The municipality borders in the south to Robertsfors Municipality, and clockwise to Umeå, Vindeln, Norsjö, Arvidsjaur and Piteå municipalities. Skellefteå is the largest coastline municipality by area, being roughly 15 percent larger than the second largest, Örnsköldsvik Municipality.

Skellefteå is situated around Skellefte River, a river that runs through the city. There is also a very central mountain, Vitberget, which is popular for skiing in the wintertime, and hiking in the summer.

===Localities===
There are 20 localities (or urban areas) in Skellefteå Municipality:

==Economy==
The largest employer in Skellefteå Municipality is the mining company Boliden AB, with about 1,200 employees.

==Elections==

===Riksdag===
These are the results of the elections to the Riksdag for Skellefteå Municipality since the 1972 municipal reform. SCB did not publish the party&#x27;s results for the Sweden Democrats between 1988 and 1998 because of the party&#x27;s small size nationally.

Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Skellefteå Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

There were 73,333 residents, including 56,888 Swedish citizens of voting age. 63.1% voted for the left coalition and 35.7% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

This refers to the protected Vindel River (Swedish: &quot;Vindelälven&quot;), which flows through the town and municipality of Sorsele.

<text>Vilhelmina Municipality (; ) is a municipality in Västerbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Vilhelmina.

==History==
In 1804 the parish of Volgsjö was renamed Vilhelmina in honour of Queen Frederica Dorothea Wilhelmina of Sweden.

In 1947 the locality Vilhelmina was detached from the rural municipality with the same name, forming the market town (&quot;köping&quot;) of Vilhelmina. The two entities were reunited in 1965.

==Geography==
Like the rest of northern Sweden (&quot;Norrland&quot;), it is scarcely populated due to its inhospitable conditions and cold climate, but is superb for those who like wildlife and untouched nature.

===Localities===
There is only one locality (or urban area) in Vilhelmina Municipality:

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Vilhelmina Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 6,473 residents, including 5,093 Swedish citizens of voting age. 51.6% voted for the left coalition and 46.7% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Culture==
Every July the town of Vilhelmina holds a festival called &quot;Hembygdsdagarna Vilhelmina&quot;. In addition to popular and folk music performances, tradition holds that a local engaged couple is selected each year to get married during the festival. The bride and groom lead a parade of fiddlers and other traditionally dressed Swedes through town to the church where the marriage is performed in front of all who wish to attend. They are not always able to find a couple willing to get married, however, so some years they hold the parade without an engaged couple, and hold a public church service instead of a wedding.

<text>Vindeln Municipality () is a municipality in Västerbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Vindeln.

==History==
In 1971 a local government reform was implemented in Sweden. This municipality was, however, not amalgamated with any other. But in preparation for the reform the name was changed in 1969 from Degerfors Municipality to Vindeln Municipality. The reason was that there is another Degerfors Municipality (in Örebro County), and every municipality in Sweden should have a unique name.

==Geography==
The Vindel River, which is the main tributary of the Ume River, runs through the municipality and has given it its name. The municipality&#x27;s coat of arms depicts a salmon, of which there are plenty in the river.

In 1928 the locality Vännäs was detached from the rural municipality with the same name, forming the market town (&quot;köping&quot;) of Vännäs. The two entities were reunited in 1971. In 1974 Bjurholm Municipality was added. A split took place in 1980 when Bjurholm Municipality was re-established.

==Geography==
The municipality is located just west of Umeå Municipality, where Umeå is the seat, with about 110,000 inhabitants, and it is part of the Umeå region. This is evident considering that the municipality has 1,500 people commuting &quot;to&quot; Umeå Municipality and about 400 commuters &quot;from&quot; Umeå Municipality. Its neighbouring municipalities Vindeln Municipality, Bjurholm Municipality and Nordmaling Municipality only receive a total of about 100 commuters from Vännäs Municipality and Vännäs Municipality receives a total of 200 commuters from them.

<text>Åsele Municipality () is a municipality in Västerbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Åsele. It is located in the southernmost fringe of Lapland.

==History==
The first Swedish settlement in Åsele Municipality (it was already inhabited by the native Sami people) was in Gafsele south of Åsele. The settlers were Nils Andersson and his wife Brita. They came from Finland in 1674, trying to avoid the war with Russia.

Fredrika is a parish in the municipality. It was created in 1799 and named in honour of Queen Frederica Dorothea Wilhelmina of Sweden. Other nearby parishes were named Dorotea and Vilhelmina, but Åsele refused to take any of these names, as they were proud of themselves and the town.

In 1974 the former market town (&quot;köping&quot;) Åsele (1959-1970) was amalgamated with Dorotea and Fredrika. In 1980 the Dorotea part was detached, forming a new Dorotea Municipality.

==Geography==

Geographically, the Ångerman River flows from Vilhelmina through Åsele Municipality, and many electric power stations are built around it.

The town Åsele is located in the middle of the municipality. It has a wooden church, a small historical (open-air) museum, and a nine-hole golf course.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Åsele Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 2,803 residents, including 2,126 Swedish citizens of voting age. 54.9% voted for the left coalition and 43.8% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Elections==

===Riksdag===
These are the results of the elections to the Riksdag for Åsele Municipality since the 1972 municipal reform. SCB did not publish the party&#x27;s results for the Sweden Democrats between 1988 and 1998 because of the party&#x27;s small size nationally.

Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party.

==Other==
The municipality has recently received some recognition as the future site of Europe&#x27;s largest Thai Buddhist temple.

<text>Carlisle is a borough in and the county seat of Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, United States. Carlisle is located within the Cumberland Valley, a highly productive agricultural region. As of the 2020 census, the borough population was 20,118; including suburbs in the neighboring townships, 37,695 live in the Carlisle urban cluster. Carlisle is the smaller principal city of the Harrisburg–Carlisle metropolitan statistical area, which includes Cumberland and Dauphin and Perry counties in South Central Pennsylvania. 

The U.S. Army War College, located at Carlisle Barracks, prepares high-level military personnel and civilians for strategic leadership responsibilities. The Carlisle Barracks ranks among the oldest U.S. Army installations and the most senior military educational institution in the United States Army. Carlisle Barracks is home of the United States Army Heritage and Education Center, an archives and museum complex open to the public. Carlisle is also home to Penn State Dickinson School of Law and Dickinson College. Dickinson College is also noted as it was the first college or university chartered after the United States was founded.

==History==
The French-born fur trader James Le Tort may have built a cabin in the area as early as 1720. During the colonial era, Scots-Irish settlers began to settle in the Cumberland Valley beginning in the early 1730s. The settlement of Carlisle, at the intersection of several Indigenous trails, was designated by the Pennsylvania assembly and the Penn family in 1751 as the seat of Cumberland County (named for the county of the same name in England). American engineer John Armstrong Sr., a surveyor for the Penn family, laid the plan for the settlement of Carlisle in 1751. Armstrong Sr. settled there and fathered John Armstrong Jr. in 1758. They named the settlement after its sister town of the same name in Cumberland, England, and even designed its former jailhouse (which now serve as general government offices in the county) to resemble the Carlisle Citadel.

As a result of conflicts on the frontier with Native American tribes, a stockade was constructed in the settlement to protect against potential attacks in 1753. In 1755, the stockade was transformed into a fort, known as Carlisle Fort or Fort Lowther. In 1757, colonel-commandant John Stanwix, for whom Fort Stanwix in Upstate New York was named, established his headquarters in Carlisle, and was promoted to brigadier general on December 27. During the French and Indian War, the North American theater of the Seven Years&#x27; War, the largely successful Forbes Expedition was organized in Carlisle in 1758; Henry Bouquet also organized a military expedition from the settlement in 1763 during Pontiac&#x27;s War.

The Pennsylvania guide, compiled by the Writers&#x27; Program of the WPA in 1940, described the early history of Carlisle&#x27;s public square and the physical changes that had occurred by the first half of the 20th century, noting that the square, located at the

The settlement of Carlisle was largely supportive of the Patriot cause during the American Revolution, and numerous individuals from the settlement served in the Revolutionary War. Carlisle contains the home of lawyer James Wilson, who served as a representative to the Continental Congress; Wilson was a signer of the Declaration of Independence in addition to being one of the framers of the U.S. Constitution.
The First Presbyterian Church, begun in 1757 and completed in 1770, is the oldest building in Carlisle, and was where the Rev. John Steel (known as &quot;The Fighting Parson&quot;) gave sermons in support of the Patriot cause during the American Revolution. The church was also where Pennsylvania settlers met on July 12, 1774, to sign a document protesting the Boston Port Act. A year later Carlisle supplied a contingent for a line infantry regiment of the Continental Army. Steel was named commander of the leading company of this group when they marched from Carlisle. No longer standing but marked by a historical marker is the home of Ephraim Blaine, Commissary General of Revolutionary Army. Also, no longer standing but commemorated, is the home of Gen. John Armstrong Sr., &quot;Hero of Kittanning,&quot; Revolutionary officer, and member of the Continental Congress. 
Still standing is the gun shop of Thomas Butler Sr., an Irish immigrant, who manufactured long rifles during the French and Indian War. He later became Chief Armorer for The First Continental Congress. He and his five sons served in the Revolutionary War and were known as &quot;The Fighting Butlers. His eldest son was Richard Butler (general).

Carlisle also served as a munitions depot during the American Revolutionary War. The depot was later developed into the United States Army War College at Carlisle Barracks. Revolutionary War legend Molly Pitcher died in the borough in 1832, and her body lies buried in the Old Public Graveyard. A hotel was built in her honor, called the Molly Pitcher Hotel; it has since been renovated to house apartments for senior citizens.

Carlisle was incorporated as a borough a few years after the war on April 13, 1782. Carlisle continued to play a part in the early development in the United States through the end of the century: In response to a planned march in favor of the United States Constitution in 1787, Anti-Federalists instigated a riot in Carlisle. A decade later, during the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794, the troops of Pennsylvania and New Jersey assembled in Carlisle under the leadership of President George Washington. While in Carlisle, the president worshiped in the First Presbyterian Church at the corner of Hanover Street and High Street.

Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, developed Carlisle Grammar School in 1773 and chartered it as Dickinson College—the first new college founded in the newly recognized United States. One of the college&#x27;s more famous alumni, the 15th U.S. president, James Buchanan, graduated in 1809. The Dickinson School of Law, founded in 1834 and affiliated then with Dickinson College, ranks as the fifth-oldest law school in the United States and the oldest law school in Pennsylvania.

On June 2, 1847, Carlisle was the site of the McClintock Slave Riot, which that broke out after a fugitive slave hearing at the courthouse; several of the fugitive slaves were able to escape during the fray with the help of Carlisle&#x27;s black residents, while one of the slave catchers later died of his wounds. A Dickinson College professor, John McClintock, was tried and acquitted for his role in the riot.

A general borough law of 1851 (amended in 1852) authorized a burgess and a borough council to administer the government of the borough of Carlisle.
Leading up to the American Civil War, Carlisle served as a stop on the Underground Railroad. During the war, an army of the Confederate States of America, under General Fitzhugh Lee, attacked and shelled the borough during the Battle of Carlisle on July 1, 1863, as part of the Gettysburg Campaign. A cannonball dent can still be seen on one of the columns of the historic county courthouse.

United States Army Lieutenant Richard Henry Pratt founded Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1879 as the first federally supported school for American Indians off a reservation. The United States government maintained the school, housed at Carlisle Barracks as an experiment in educating Native Americans and teaching them to reject tribal culture and to adapt to white society. Pratt retired from the Army in 1903 and from supervising the school as its superintendent in 1904. Athletic hero Jim Thorpe entered the school in 1907 and joined its football team under coach Glenn &quot;Pop&quot; Warner in 1908. Playing halfback, Jim Thorpe led the team to startling upset victories over powerhouses Harvard, Army, and the University of Pennsylvania in 1911–12, bringing nationwide attention to the school. Marianne Moore taught there from 1911 to 1914. Carlisle Indian School closed in 1918.

Dickinson School of Law was chartered as an independent institution in 1890. Dickinson School of Law merged into the Pennsylvania State University in 1997 as Penn State Dickinson School of Law.

Carlisle was the original eastern terminus of the Pennsylvania Turnpike when it opened in October 1940.

The Carlisle Historic District, Carlisle Indian Industrial School, Hessian Powder Magazine, Carlisle Armory, and Old West, Dickinson College are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Carlisle is located slightly northeast of the center of Cumberland County at (40.202553, −77.195016) at an elevation of .

==History==
Jay Cooke was among the investors who in 1864 purchased the South Mountain Iron Company at Pine Grove Furnace, a charcoal-fired iron operation dating to 1764. The specific reason that Cooke Township was created in 1872 out of previously existing Penn Township (established 1860) is unclear. Jay Cooke lost the company in the Panic of 1873, but bought back a major portion of it four years later with a group of investors as the South Mountain Mining and Iron Company. He was still a co-owner at the time of his death. According to the biography by Oberholtzer (who Cooke and his family assisted), Jay Cooke visited Pine Grove Furnace repeatedly. Cooke fished for trout there—he was an avid outdoorsman throughout his life—and he annually brought gifts such as pocket knives and scissors to the small school established there for the workers&#x27; children. Cooke Township continues to this day as a very lightly populated but heavily forested area, while the former center of the iron industry within it is now Pine Grove Furnace State Park.

The Pine Grove Furnace was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

<text>Enola is a census-designated place (CDP) located along the Susquehanna River in East Pennsboro Township, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 6,111 at the 2010 census. Norfolk Southern operates Enola Yard, a large rail yard and locomotive shop in Enola. It is situated in Cumberland County, directly across the Susquehanna River from Harrisburg and is part of the Harrisburg–Carlisle metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
The town came into existence due to the building of rail lines through the area. Local farmers Francis and Wesley Miller sold 
 to the Pennsylvania Railroad to be used as a flag station. Mr. Miller was given the honor of naming the train station. He named the station &quot;Enola&quot;, after his daughter. Miller at the time was the only resident living in the area. Eventually, when more people moved to the area the local post office and surrounding town adopted the name as well.

In the fall of 1902, the Pennsylvania Railroad made the decision to build a classification yard &quot;between Marysville, Pennsylvania and West Fairview, Pennsylvania, Enola Yard.&quot; In 1903, their agent, the Manor Realty Co. purchasing , officially opened the yards in January 1905. Of the 743 acres, the Enola Realty Co. bought for $26,500. This would officially become known as Enola (or current North Enola).

Starting in 1909, the Realty Company went on to build more than 220 homes which it rented or sold to families coming to the village looking for employment.

South Enola grew almost as rapidly as North Enola. Some of the landowners were Mann, Bretz, Darr, Ruplay, Pyne, and Addams.

West Enola also grew with the boom of the Enola Yards. The largest landowner of that time was Britton. Other large landowners were Lantz and Renninger.

Enola is served by a single high school, East Pennsboro High School. Originally named Enola High School, it was built on farmland which had been owned by the Gutshall family from the late 1800s until the 1940s. It is located at 425 West Shady Lane, parallel to Gutshall Road. The original Enola High School is located on 98 South Enola Drive. It is the home of the East Pennsboro Branch Library, township offices and the East Pennsboro Township Police department. An early elementary school is located at 126 N. Enola Drive. That property was sold and now houses several businesses.

==Geography==
Enola is located near the eastern edge of Cumberland County at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.04%, is water.

It is on the west shore of the Susquehanna River facing the city of Harrisburg. U.S. Route 11/15 runs north-to-south through Enola.

==Demographics==
==Education==
East Pennsboro Area School District serves as the public education center for Enola. The district consists of four schools: East Pennsboro Area High School, East Pennsboro Area Middle School, East Pennsboro Elementary School, and West Creek Hills Elementary School with a total enrollment of about 2,900 students.

==Notable people==

* Lynn Myers, Major League Baseball player, brother of Billy Myers
* Betty Warfel, pitcher and infielder, played for Rockford Peaches
* George W. Fisher, first Yard Master of the newly built Enola Yard, then the largest freight yard in the world. He was an employee of the Pennsylvania Railroad when he, his wife, and eight children moved from Philadelphia to Enola in 1906 for him to assume his new position.

==Historical Context==
Mifflin Township, which comprised the current area of Upper Mifflin and Lower Mifflin Townships, was established in 1797 from Newton Township, Cumberland County. In 1892 Mifflin Township separated and became Lower Mifflin Township and Upper Mifflin Township. Early settlers of Cumberland County were mostly of Scots-Irish descent. By the end of the 1700s the majority of settlers had shifted from Scots-Irish to German.
During the French and Indian War in the 1750s it was feared that Indian tribes in Western Pennsylvania would raid settlements in Cumberland County. Between 1755 and 1758 several forts were established in the County to protect the residents. These included Mitchel’s Fort at Three Square Hollow in Upper Mifflin Township, and McComb’s Blockhouse near Doubling Gap in Lower Mifflin Township.
In 1865, prospectors drilling for oil in Lower Mifflin Township struck a large high quality aquifer. Due to the water’s purity, it was bottled and used for medicinal purposes in 1885. Later, the Cloverdale Spring Company was formed and used the water for its soft drink business. A bottling plant was built near Newville in 1919 which became the Allegheny Pepsi Cola Bottling Company in 1961.
The State acquired the area of Colonel Denning State Park in Doubling Gap as a recreation area in 1930. The Civilian Conservation Corps developed it as a park in 1936. The park is named for William Denning who lived near Newville and manufactured cannons for the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. Tuscarora State Forest is also administered by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) and was named for the Iroquois-nation tribe that once inhabited the area.
