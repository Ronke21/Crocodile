<text>Borås ( , , ) is a city (officially, a locality) and the seat of Borås Municipality, Västra Götaland County, Sweden. It had 114,556 inhabitants in 2024. It is widely known for being a textile city, home to worldwide brands and companies as well as the prestigious Swedish School of Textiles, which is part of the University of Borås.

== Geography ==
Borås is located at the point of two crossing railways, among them the railway between Gothenburg and Kalmar, and is often considered the Swedish city gaining the most from the nationwide railway system laid between 1870 and 1910.

== History ==
The city of Borås received its privileges in 1621 by King Gustav II Adolf. The reason was to give local pedlars a legal place for vending their merchandise (and for the government the ability to collect taxes on this trade). The city developed soon after it was founded. After a century it had increased to over 2,000 inhabitants. Borås has been ravaged by fires four times: in 1681, 1727, 1822 and 1827. The Caroli church is the oldest of Borås&#x27;s buildings, and has withstood all fires.

In its 2017 report, Police in Sweden placed the Norrby, Hässleholmen and Hulta districts in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates.

In 2021, Borås marked its 400th anniversary.

==Industry==
The city arms depicts two pairs of sheep shears, a tribute to the vast number of smiths in the town in early history. It currently holds the Swedish record in the number of established mail-order firms.

The company Swedac is based in the city, as well as Ericsson, which has a large manufacturing plant where Mini-Link microwave radios are manufactured. Worldwide clothing retailer H&amp;M have their worldwide Online office based in the city as well.

Outside the city in the industrial park of Viared, there are many companies specializing in logistics. Industries in Borås have close collaboration with the University College of Borås as well as the SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden, the largest technical research institute of Sweden, both located in Borås. Besides being the home of the official Swedish Kilogram-weight and the atomic clock that sets the national time, SP conducts various testing and research to promote consumer safety.

==Transport==
===Railway===
Borås is a railway junction. The Coast-to-Coast Line from Gothenburg to Kalmar runs through the city centre. At the Borås Railway Station it meets the Älvsborg Line (heading north to Herrljunga and Uddevalla) and the Viskadal Line (going south to Varberg). Continuous passenger trains often run through the city along the two latter lines.

As of 2019 SJ runs 3–4 daily trains in each direction between Gothenburg and Kalmar. The regional traffic agency Västtrafik runs frequent trains between Borås and Gothenburg, Herrljunga, and Varberg. All passenger trains stop at Borås railway station. Trains on the northern line to and from Herrljunga also stop at Knalleland halt within the city.

During the holiday All Saints&#x27; Day, there is an annual gaming convention called Borås Spelkonvent, where people, mostly youths, meet to play various board games, Warhammer 40k and among other games.

== Climate ==
Borås has a humid continental climate, or cold oceanic climate using the −3 °C isotherm, influenced by Atlantic trade winds travelling without major obstacles over the land, with low mean temperatures, compared to coastal areas and the more urban metropolis, Gothenburg, near to the west. Considering it being inland and quite far south, summer temperatures are rather subdued by Swedish standards, whilst winter average highs hover just above freezing. Being inland still enables severe extremes to sometimes occur, such as a reading from July 1901, the warmest July temperature on record in Götaland until 2022, although not a national record ( set on two different June dates and years on other stations). The coldest extreme was set in February 1966 with , a severely cold temperature for southern Sweden.

By Swedish standards, the climate of Borås is very wet, with a precipitation average of above . This is also due to maritime airflows coming from the Atlantic and easily being transported over lowland areas, where the precipitation eventually falls with a slight orographic lift. This renders heavy solid or wet snowfall in winter and the freeze-thaw cycle is normally dominant, with irregular snow cover.

<text>Dals-Ed Municipality (&quot;Dals-Eds kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Västra Götaland County in western Sweden, on the border to Norway. Its seat is located in the town of Ed.

The present municipality was formed during the local government reform of 1952 through the amalgamation of six former units. Its territory was not affected by the 1971 reform.

==Locality==
There is only one locality with more than 200 inhabitants in the municipality, and that is the seat Ed.

== Demographics ==
This is a demographic table based on Dals-Ed Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 4,745 residents, including 3,504 Swedish citizens of voting age. 36.4% voted for the left coalition and 61.8% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Tourism==
Dals-Ed Municipality, located in the historical province of Dalsland, has a united tourism motto for Dalsland, saying that Dalsland, with its population of 50,000, is a place where one will not feel crowded. This is perhaps most fitting for Dals-Ed, as it is the sparsest populated municipality in Västra Götaland County, with 6.7 inhabitants per km2.

The municipality promises a quiet environment. The nature hosts some 400 lakes for bathing, canoeing, fishing or boat tours. There are also several nature reserves, and the northernmost oak woods of Sweden grow in the municipality. In addition, the large Tresticklan National Park is contained within the municipality.

Historically Dals-Ed is rewarding for those interested in the ancient. Some 60 grave fields and burial places are situated here.

==Tourism==
The scarcely populated municipalities in the historical province of Dalsland, with a total of 50,000 inhabitants, have a unified tourism information. Färgelanda with its low population is preferring to boast its nature. There are several opportunities for fishing, and Ellenösjön is a popular lake for pikeperch fishing. The nature reserve in Kroppefjäll offers walking lines and a mountainous nature. There is canoeing and swimming in the many lakes and streams.

Färgelanda also has an old and well-preserved ancient history. Rock carvings in Ödeborg are located by Brötegården Museum; furthermore there are some 140 grave fields from the Iron Age scattered in the municipality. Something in between a museum and a folk museum is Ödeborg&#x27;s Fornsal, with more than 6,000 objects gathered from Dalsland in the last millennia.

<text>Grästorp Municipality (&quot;Grästorps kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Västra Götaland County in western Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Grästorp.

Grästorp Municipality is located right in the middle of Västra Götaland County, by the shores of Lake Vänern.

==History==

In the year 1900 the village Grästorp was detached from Tengene and made a market town (&quot;köping&quot;). The local government reform of 1952 amalgamated it with twelve surrounding municipalities (among them Tengene). The 1971 reform made the term &quot;köping&quot; obsolete, thus forming Grästorps kommun without amendment of territory.

The area has been inhabited at least since the Viking Age as it contains several runestones. The runestone at the church at Sal has an inscription that reads &quot;Torgård satte denna sten efter Toke, sin frände&quot;, meaning &quot;Torgård raised this stone for Toke, his kinsman&quot;.
==Localities==
The seat Grästorp (pop. 3,000) is the only built-up locality with more than 200 inhabitants in this predominantly rural area.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Grästorp Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 5,727 residents, including 4,530 Swedish citizens of voting age. 39.2% voted for the left coalition and 59.5% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

The municipal reform of 1952 grouped them into three, new, larger units. These were amalgamated in 1967 to form the present municipality.

The two most notable sights in the municipality are the mountain/ridge Kinnekulle (with 306 meters the highest point in the county) and the village Husaby, with an old church and church well, where the first Christian king of Sweden, Olof Skötkonung, is believed to have been baptized.

<text>Hjo Municipality (&quot;Hjo kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Västra Götaland County in western Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Hjo.

The municipality was created in 1971, when the &quot;City of Hjo&quot; was amalgamated with a part of the rural municipality Värsås. In 1974 parts of Fröjered and Fågelås were added.

==Geography==
Geographically it is situated by the western shore of Lake Vättern. The large and fish-rich waters have been the main influence on the industry. The largest rivulet intersecting the municipality from Vättern is the Hjo River. Parts of it have been made a nature reserve. Partly this is due to the salmon (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot;) and the grayling (&quot;Thymallus thymallus&quot;) that occur natural in the rivulet, but have had hard times due to dams.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Hjo Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 9,227 residents, including 7,214 Swedish citizens of voting age. 44.6% voted for the left coalition and 54.2% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

<text>Lysekil Municipality (&quot;Lysekils kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Västra Götaland County in western Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Lysekil.

The present municipality was formed in 1971, when the &quot;City of Lysekil&quot; (instituted as such in 1903) was amalgamated with Stångenäs and the island of Skaftö.

==Geography==

Lysekil Municipality borders to the municipalities of Sotenäs (in the north-west), Munkedal (north) and Uddevalla (east). The city of Lysekil is located on the southern tip of the municipality, by the Kattegatt strait.

The bay to the east, marking the border to Uddevalla, is called Gullmarsfjorden, or Gullmarn. It is Sweden&#x27;s only true fjord. It is 25 km long, between 1–3 km wide, with a maximum depth of 118.5 meters. The depth at the mouth is only 20–40 meters on average, leading to a distinctive marine life in the fjord. Gullmaren is currently Sweden&#x27;s only marine nature preservation area, and is home to several marine research institutes due to it being an easily studied microclimate.

Some of the municipal islets are considered part of the Gothenburg archipelago. Many islets are like small communities by themselves, with interesting histories of trading, fishing and stone quarrying in addition to their scenic nature.

===Localities===
*Lysekil (seat), 7,300 inhabitants
*Brastad, 1,800
*Lyse, 1,700
*Brodalen, 1,050
*Grundsund, 627
*Fiskebäckskil, 438
*Rixö, 357

==History==
In Lysekil, humans have long left a mark on water, wood, soil, and stone.
With protected harbor surrounded by water and jutting out toward the fisheries of Kattegatt, The North Sea, and beyond, Lysekil has deep ties to the fishing and canning industry. Mirrored fish on the current municipal coat of arms and a jumping dolphin on that of 1895 show the absolute dominance of the sea on the area. 

To many outsiders, especially those coming from Stockholm and the East coast whose ocean access was only the salty waters of the Baltic Sea, The granite beach and sweet water of Gullmarsfjorden made Lysekil a famous bathing location in 19th century. Kallbadhuset (the cold bathing house), a somewhat exclusive, and very popular wooden bathing house dating from 1847 still stands in operation. Local rumor has it that once upon a time the King of Sweden would visit the Lysekil bathing house and specifically ask that the commoners of the town be allowed enter the wooden walls of Kallbadhuset because he &#x27;liked&#x27; the everyday people of Lysekil (whom otherwise were not welcome inside the Bathing house compound.

Traditionally fishing, sailing, farming, stone-cutting, and forestry formed the largest chunk of the local economy and continue today; however, petroleum products refining (Preemraff in Lyse,) light industry (Husqvarna in Brastad,) and local and international tourism (especially during the summertime,) all form a large part in the economy of the municipality.

==Herring fishing==
Herring fishing has played a big role in the history of Lysekil. For some reason the herring always returned close to the coastline in Bohuslän for longer periods of time and therefore made it easier for large amounts of fish to be caught. Herring fishing was popular already during the middle ages but most known is the periods of 1556-1589, 1747-1809 and 1877-1906. During these years, sales of salted herring resulted in hundreds of thousands of exports all over the world.

In Lysekil there are traces of old herring fisheries in several places, most of them on Härnäset, stora skeppsholmen and Saltö, as well as several factory buildings left where the herring was prepared and packaged.

==Listed buildings==
The municipality of Lysekil has three listed buildings. A listed building (byggnadsminne) is a building that is legally protected and preserved because of its cultural and historical significance. The county administrative board (Länsstyrelsen) and the Swedish national heritage board (Riksantikvarieämbetet) decides which buildings become listed buildings. The three buildings are:

* Curmanska villorna 
* Wilhelmsons villa 
* Härnäsets folkets hus 

Other buildings and areas of cultural and historical heritage in Lysekil are protected through detailed development plans under control of the municipality. Some of those places can for example be found in the old town area (Gamlestan), Fiskebäckskil and Östersidan.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Lysekil Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 14,245 residents, including 11,346 Swedish citizens of voting age. 47.5% voted for the left coalition and 51.1% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

<text>Munkedal Municipality (&quot;Munkedals kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Västra Götaland County in western Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Munkedal.

The nationwide municipal reform of 1952 saw the creation of Munkedal, Svarteborg, Sörbygden and Ödeborg as larger rural municipalities. As early as 1967 Ödeborg was dissolved and parts of it added to Munkedal. Finally, in 1974 Svarteborg and Sörbygden were merged into Munkedal forming the present unit.

==Etymology==
The municipality is named after the old farm Munkedal. This farm was owned by the monks at Dragsmark Abbey. The last element is &quot;dal&quot; &#x27;dale, valley&#x27;.

==Geography==
Munkedal is located 110 km north of Gothenburg. The geography is a varied terrain, covered with part forests, part mountains, part plains and part lakes and streams.

==History==
This area in western Sweden, by the Norwegian border, has been inhabited perhaps longer than any other in Sweden. Distinctives for Munkedal are some tools that have been dated to 8000 BC, found around 1900 at a farm named Herregårda. There is also a petroglyph area called Lökeberg på Tungenäset, dated to the Nordic Bronze Age.

In the medieval age, a monastery of Dragsmark was located within the current municipal borders. It subsequently led to the name Munkedal, and the names chosen for the municipality when it was established in 1974 with the reform. The coat of arms also portrait a medieval scroll and writing pen, characteristics for monks.

==Demographics==

<text>Partille Municipality (&quot;Partille kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Västra Götaland County in western Sweden. Its seat is located in Partille, which constitutes a part of the contiguously built-up Gothenburg urban area.

The municipality is by area one of the smallest in Sweden with only 59.35 km2.

The parish Partille was made a rural municipality, when the first local government acts came into force in 1863. Territorially it has not been affected by the nationwide municipal reforms carried out during the 20th century. It has retained its area, but it has developed into a suburb of Gothenburg.

==Geography==
The municipality is subdivided into four geographical areas: Partille, Sävedalen, Jonsered and Öjersjö.

The area is a traditional Swedish woodland. Much of its industries has therefore a connection to the forest industry.

===Localities===
The western part of the municipality is part of the contiguous Gothenburg urban area. This then leads into Partille Centrum, which is the seat and the central part of the municipality.

Other localities are:
*Jonsered
*Kåhög
*Öjersjö
*Furulund, Partille

== Demographics ==
This is a demographic table based on Partille Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 39,420 residents, including 28,286 Swedish citizens of voting age. 48.1% voted for the left coalition and 50.7% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==History==
The area has been inhabited for more than a thousand years. Fifteen ancient monuments from that time remain.

Partille is located in a valley, between some mountains in a rocky terrain. Its name is believed to be derived from something similar to &quot;Part haella&quot; meaning &quot;split rock&quot;. Another possible meaning could be &quot;Port haella&quot;, the door in the mountain. The small river Säveån flows through the valley and intersects Partille. The name Säveån stems from the words &quot;säve&quot;, as in &quot;sävligt&quot; (leisurely, slow) and &quot;ån&quot; (the stream/creek), as it is a very slowly flowing little river. The river has been of great importance for Partille throughout its history. The fertile soil around it was used for agriculture and during the medieval ages a lot of farms were located there.

The oldest existing building in Partille is Partille Kyrka &quot;(Partille Church)&quot; which was built in the 13th century. The church, being placed in the current centre of Partille, indicates that the present centre has been the natural rendezvous and centre of the municipality ever since it was built. Being a Swedish, very old-fashioned, Partille Kyrka has no bell tower, as a complement a separate belfry was built in 1652.

It is also an excellent place for fishing. Records from the 16th century show that government officials fished here at the time. As is still the case today, the most popular fish were salmon and trout.

Apart from agriculture and forestry transportations has been a very important field of business. The manager of the East India Company, David af Sanderberg, built Partille Herrgård &quot;(manor)&quot; between 1770 and 1780, today this manor serves a landmark for everyone who passes through the municipality. Later, during the 19th century, Sweden&#x27;s first industrial society developed in Jonsered. The Scotsmen William Gibson and Alexander Keiller opened a factory for production of sail- and tent cloth. Sweden&#x27;s first terrace-houses in classical English style was also built there. Nowadays Jonsered is still classified as a national interest due to its well preserved cultural environment.

==Economy==
Industries which are based in Partille include: Soft Touch AB (Personal Protective Equipment), Triumfglass (ice cream), Swisslog, Ragn Sells.

Apart from Partille Manor, the main key feature of Partille is the shopping mall Allum. In 1999 Partille municipality initiated a cooperation with the construction company Sten &amp; Ström Sverige. The aim of this co-operation was to unify the two parts of the municipality, each on the north/south of the highway E20. The construction of Allum began on 3 February 2004 and was completed on 9 April 2006. The name &quot;Allum&quot; comes from the old Swedish word for &quot;alla&quot; (everyone), the name thus mean &quot;åt alla&quot; (for everyone) or &quot;till alla&quot; (to everyone). The mall has created roughly 650 new jobs and includes around 100 stores.

==Sports==

The following sports clubs are located in Partille:

* Partille IF
* IK Sävehof
* Jonsereds IF
* Partille Badminton

===Partille Cup===
The handball tournament Partille Cup was first launched in Partille in 1963, it was then played at Vallhamra Idrottsplats &quot;Vallhamra sports field&quot;. As the tournament grew in size it was partially, and later entirely moved to Gothenburg, where it is now played. Partille Cup is the world&#x27;s greatest handball tournament for youths, in 2010 the tournament featured 1035 teams from 46 countries.

<text>Skövde () is a locality and urban centre in Skövde Municipality and Västra Götaland County, in the Västergötland (Western Gothland region) in central southern Sweden.

Skövde is situated around 150 km northeast of Gothenburg, between Sweden&#x27;s two largest lakes, Vänern and Vättern. It lies on the eastern slope of a low mountain ridge, Billingen (304 m), which cuts through the plain between the lakes. The Western Main Railway (Västra Stambanan) was built through Skövde in the 1850s, which gave the town a dramatic industrial and population boost.

Today, Skövde is home to the headquarters for Skaraborg&#x27;s District Court and is the Västra Götaland&#x27;s fourth-largest urban area as well as Sweden&#x27;s 32nd biggest locality (by population) with 39,580 inhabitants in 2020.

==History==


Skövde traces its history back to the Medieval Age. In Skövde&#x27;s city coat of arms is the image of Saint Elin (also known as Saint Helena), who was considered a pious woman from Skövde. She was born about 1101, and was canonized in 1164.

Of the medieval houses that once existed virtually nothing remains, as a fire in 1759 burned down the entire city except for some houses called Helensgården. After the fire, the city was rebuilt according to a grid pattern. The city only had a small population until the railway between Stockholm and Gothenburg was laid through the city, leading to an industrial and population boost.

===Pre-16th century===
Skövde&#x27;s patron saint, Saint Elin (also known as Saint Helena), lived in the 12th century. According to legend, she was murdered on the way to a church consecration. She was canonized on 30 July 1164 by Pope Alexander III and Archbishop Stefan of Sweden. During the Middle Ages, people made pilgrimages to Elin&#x27;s grave, and this contributed to the city&#x27;s development and growth.

During the Middle Ages Skövde was a successful city, the economy thriving and Skövde eventually developed into a city of significant importance. Adjacent to the city were three churches: The City Church, The Elin Chapel directly south of the city, and Holy Birgitta&#x27;s Chapel in the north. The city was at this time probably not especially great in area or population, rather its greatness lay in that it was once home to the Patron Saint of the Diocese, St. Elin. The pilgrims travelled here to visit the Saint&#x27;s origin and burial place, and the commerce around the pilgrims came to be an important prerequisite for Skövde&#x27;s development in the ensuing century.

The exact year when Skövde got its town charter is unknown, but it can be assumed to be sometime around the year 1400 when the city was mentioned in a tax roll. At the beginning of the 16th century, King Gustav Vasa confirmed the town&#x27;s charter in a letter.

===The 16th century until the Fire of 1759===
If the 15th century was marked by success, then the 16th century saw an emergent decline for the city. The main reason for this was the Reformation and the transition to the Lutheran faith. They wanted to cleanse out all forms of idol worship in the form of saintly cults from the churches; these churches were emptied of treasures and relics, and Skövde itself did not escape.

Pilgrims ceased to travel here and a large part of the city&#x27;s revenue disappeared practically overnight. King Gustav Vasa also had plans to move the city together with some other cities of the West Göta region to Hornborgasjön (&#x27;Lake Hornborg&#x27;) in order to build a great city.

In 1520 the first documented setback took place for Skövde. The Danish King, Kristian II, undertook his third military campaign against Sweden. One of the Danish armies swept through Västergötland (Western Götland) and burned down Skövde, Falköping, Skara and Bogesund (now Ulricehamn).

It was only in the 17th century that figures of how many people lived in Skövde could be estimated with any fair degree of certainty. For the year 1655, the city presented a census of 134 people, 34 farmers, 38 housewives, 12 sons, 3 daughters, 2 farmhands, 8 maids, 10 boarders, 14 boatmen, and 13 described as &#x27;63 years old&#x27;, i.e. contemporary retirees. During the 1660s there was some growth, and in 1669 the city had a population of 168 people.

At the beginning of the 18th century, Skövde was one of the county&#x27;s smallest towns. In 1700, the town has just 154 inhabitants, but only 50 years later had the population risen to 381. In 1770 the population had risen up to 500 people. At the beginning of the 18th century, the Swedish towns and country districts had to take care of prisoners of war captured by Karl XII&#x27;s armies. It was the Saxons, Germans, Danes, Norwegians, Poles and Cossacks who lived in enforced internship in Skövde.

In 1708, there were up to 56 prisoners of war in Skövde. In the town hall&#x27;s civil rules one can read that the number of prisoners was now so great that every citizen had to now take care of a prisoner. In 1718, there were up to 90 Danish prisoners, in other words, the number of prisoners of war came to dominate the small Skövde.

In 1746, Carl von Linné was out on his journey through Västra Götaland, where he also visited tracts of Skövde. He talks in detail about the pollarded meadows in Berg, beeches on Ingasäter and Mölltorp&#x27;s alum works. When on 27 June he reached Skövde, he did not have much positive to say, &#x27;Skövde town, quarter before six from Berg, was a very small spot, located on the east side of Billingen, without any lake or particular feature, the houses were small, streets irregular and Cemetery on set with lovely boxes. This city has once been the seat of St. Helena.&#x27; His journey continued southerly, the next stop being Skultorp. Once again Linnaeus was compelled to share his experiences, describing women&#x27;s hats, farmhands&#x27; courtship and the magnificent view from Skultorp&#x27;s Nabbe.

The year 1759 saw the destruction of central Skövde in a large fire. A block of old wooden houses are preserved, and together with a botanical garden, form the cultural reserve Helénsparken. The oldest house in the park, Helénsstugan (&#x27;Heléns cottage&#x27;) is from the early 18th century. Next to Hertig Johan&#x27;s Torg (&#x27;Duke Johan&#x27;s Square&#x27;) is Saint Helena&#x27;s Church and church park.

===Town after the fire===
Skövde recovered after the fire. The social life began to flourish, balls and theatrical performances followed one another. The inhabitants of the city lived a safe and hopefully pleasant small-town life. However, new winds would blow that would change the city&#x27;s development for a long time.

At the start of the 1860s, the city&#x27;s area was limited to what is now called the old city. Some major industries did not exist yet; handicrafts, trade and agriculture were the only industries that were practiced. Agriculture and animal husbandry were the primary industries for the inhabitants right up to the 1850s, while the actual town&#x27;s urban bourgeoisie industries were developed.

The policemen in Skövde, or &#x27;the magistrate&#x27;s henchmen&#x27; as they were known in formal terms of the time, were few in number during the first part of the 19th century. The city&#x27;s police force consisted of one permanent employee. The uniform cap showed his power and authority, while his armament consisted of a truncheon. His task was to carry out the punishment when someone was convicted to be flogged.

In the early 19th century, the town was dominated by one-storey houses. The roofs were usually covered with straw, reeds, peat or boards. Only in 1850 did it become common to use brick.

During the 19th century, the first half of the year had six or seven markets in Skövde. 1847 saw the introduction of market square days, which soon came to have the character of regular market days. The market came to be limited to two times a year, one in spring and one in autumn. An important market was the remounting market (&quot;remonterinsmarknaden&quot;), or horse market, that occurred annually on 19 September. It was widely known, even beyond the country&#x27;s borders. Buyers came from the cavalry and artillery regiments, but also individual buyers from Norway, Denmark and Germany, to buy young horses. The trade was so great that several thousand horses could change hands in a single day.

On 2 April 1832, it was decided that the streets would be named. Previously, all the plots of land were only numbered. But it was not long before street addresses completely broke through, though even in the 1930s plot numbers were sufficient to use as post addresses.

In 1858, the population of the city increased and soon the railway stood finished. In 1859, the Västra stambanan (&#x27;Western Main Line&#x27;) was inaugurated. Discussions on a newspaper began to take off. They got in touch with the editor of &quot;Göteborgs Handels- och Sjöfartstidning&quot; (&quot;Gothenburg Trade and Maritime News Journal&quot;), S.A. Hedlund, who promised to provide news content and editorials. The newspaper was called &quot;Sköfde Tidning&quot; (&quot;Skövde Newspaper&quot;) and was published every Saturday. The first issue came out on 13 November 1858. In 1960, the paper, then known as &quot;Västgöta Korrespondenten Skövde Tidning&quot; (VK – &quot;The West Göta Correspondent&quot;), joined with Skaraborgs Läns Annonsblad (SLA – &quot;Skaraborg County Advertiser&quot;, founded in 1884).

On 18 June 1870, a hydrotherapy spa opened nearby the railway station, which had the effect of Skövde experiencing a short period as a spa resort. The spa, founded by Dr. Lars G Dovertie, was busily frequented by during the 1870s and 1880s. Since 1992, the spa has been a student union building.

In 1884, a company was formed to meet the need of an indoor riding arena. The city voluntarily donated a spot just north of the city. The riding school was later to become a key player in future discussions about placing regiments in Skövde. 1889 brought the issue of trying to get Life Regiment Hussars&#x27;s recruit school to Skövde. It was suggested that this would see a shift from a &#x27;tenement soldier&#x27; regiment (soldiers from Sweden&#x27;s allotment system) to an enlisted troupe. In 1891, it was decided that Skövde would get the regiment in two years, but at the end of 1894 Örebro emerged as a competitor to Skövde. Örebro had certain advantages, for example a large indoor riding arena, but after new bids from Skövde, the town emerged victorious. Since 1896 the Husarernas rekrytskola (&#x27;Hussars Recruit School&#x27;) has been located in Skövde.

The latter half of the 20th century was characterised by furious redevelopment. This brought parking lots and the creation of monumental buildings, some arguably more beautiful than others. Centuries-old features of the cityscape were erased, in particular all the old wooden housing settlements in the old town&#x27;s western part. Otherwise the 20th century in Skövde was characterised greatly by the presence of the military. Military-dressed men have been a marked feature of Skövde&#x27;s streets, even if drastically less so at the end of the 20th century and into the new millennium.

==Climate==
Skövde has a maritime-continental hybrid climate. The town is influenced by being in the slope of a hill, which leads to warmer overnight lows than in Skara on the western side of the same higher area. In July 2018, Skövde recorded a mean during the 2018 European heat wave. This makes it one of the very few stations in Sweden to have met the Köppen definition of a hot summer at any point in recorded weather history. Even so, Skövde is not frequently warm during an average year. On average, summers are cooler than on the east coast of the country. This is due to strong low pressure systems from the North Atlantic bringing plenty of rainy days along with an elevation of . Skövde does still have a lower precipitation total than areas to its south such as Borås and areas in Halland that are affected even more by the maritime patterns.

==Economy==

===Volvo and Aurobay===
Aurobay (formerly part of Volvo Cars) and Volvo Group Truck Operations (a company within the Volvo Group) jointly operate one of the world&#x27;s largest automotive foundries in Skövde, and are Skövde&#x27;s two largest employers. The Volvo Group Truck Operations plant is AB Volvo&#x27;s largest producer of industrial diesel engines worldwide (producing engine blocks, cylinder heads and flywheels as well as engine mounts and disk brakes). Aurobay produces sustainable, efficient, hybrid engines for Volvo Cars and will eventually do so other customers. Aurobay has capacity for 600,000 powertrain solutions a year. In 2021, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency approved a grant of SEK 144 million for the conversion of part of the Skövde plant to produce powertrains for electric vehicles. In 2011, the two plants combined had over 4,000 permanent employees (2,100 employees at Volvo Group Truck Operations ).

===Diversified industries===
Skövde is a diversified industrial centre, and includes companies such as CEJN AB (pneumatic, hydraulic and high pressure hydraulic quick connect couplings), Furhoffs Rostfria (&#x27;Furhoff&#x27;s Stainless Steel&#x27; – sinks and drainage), Cementa (cement) and Grahns Konfektyr (&#x27;Grahn&#x27;s Confectionery&#x27; – sweets).

Skövde has many public service employers and the largest of them in Skövde Municipality. Other public service employers include the Swedish Armed Forces, Skaraborg Hospital, Kärnsjukhuset (also known as KSS – The Central Hospital), The university, Skaraborgs District Court (&quot;Skaraborgs Tingsrätt&quot;), Swedish Police and Västtrafik.

Few places can match Skövde&#x27;s development in recent years as a commercial centre. Retail sales in the city have increased by 40% over the past 10 years. This contributes to the relatively large trade sector bringing many jobs in small and medium enterprises.

Skövde is a centre for game development and games for training. In the business park Gothia Science Park, there are dozens of game companies that have both developed and produced games in Skövde, such as Coffee Stain Studios and Stunlock Studios. The proximity to the relatively large gaming development program at the University of Skövde is a major contributing factor to Skövde having become a game development centre.

The many varied employment opportunities in Skövde have meant an increase in daily commuting to the city from neighboring municipalities.

===Commerce, retail and trade===
Skövde is a shopping town with a large selection. The city centre is Skaraborg&#x27;s largest shopping centre with over 40 shops and restaurants. It is located directly adjacent to Hertig Johans Torg and Sandtorget (&#x27;Sand Square&#x27;) and has its own car park. In the centre are several major brands and a variety of smaller shops. In October 2008, the newly renovated shopping mall Vasaporten was finished (formerly Göfab Huset) with a dozen shops, a new entrance to Willys grocery store and 500 parking spaces in the adjoining car park.

Norrmalm&#x27;s commerce precinct contains about twenty shops along Gustavus Adolphusgatan. Here lies a big, new shopping centre, Elins Esplanad (formerly Maxi-house), with 30 shops, an Ica Maxi Supermarket and a restaurant and cafe. There are thousands of free parking spaces including 200 in the garage. Elin&#x27;s Esplanade was opened on 28 November 2008.

Stallsikens commerce precinct is an entirely new bulk retail area built for big new stores to open in Skövde. Tenants include auto parts store Biltema, garden store Plantagen, furniture retailer Mio, discount retailer Ö&amp;B, furniture and home decor store Chili, home and leisure department store Rusta and electronics store Media Markt. The inauguration took place in stages, starting in the spring of 2008.

Skövde has three trading areas: The centre, Norrmalm and Stallsiken, which are all within easy reach of the city. In addition, there are more specific traders in several other areas of Skövde: Aspelund, Hasslum, Mariesjö, Hallenbergrondellen (&#x27;Hallenberg&#x27;ss roundabout&#x27;), Karstorpsrondellen (&#x27;Karstorp&#x27;s roundabout&#x27;) and Billingesluttningen (&#x27;The Billinge Hillside&#x27;).

==Culture and entertainment==

Skövde Kulturhus (&#x27;Skovde&#x27;s Civic Cultural Centre&#x27;) was built in 1964 and is Sweden&#x27;s first cultural centre to bring together diverse cultural disciplines under the one roof. The cultural centre was designed by architect Hans-Erland Heineman, and houses the art gallery, art museum, library, theatre and cinema.

===Museums===

Skövde&#x27;s City Museum was previously situated in Gamla Rådhuset (&#x27;The Old Town Hall&#x27;) at Hertig Johan&#x27;s Torg. After 2005 the museum was moved to Norrmalm. In the museum, there are letters, legal documents, maps, theatre posters and newspaper clippings. In the archive, there are even tens of thousands of photographs from Skövde and numerous portrait photos from the 19th century. In storage, there are nearly 40,000 objects, though nobody really knows how many as not all are yet catalogued.

There is also an external exhibition in the city centre: Helénsgården (&#x27;Helén&#x27;s farm&#x27; or also Helénsstugan – &#x27;Heléns cottage&#x27; or Petter Heléns stuga – &#x27;Petter Heléns cottage&#x27;). It is the only remaining building from the great fire affecting the city in 1759, which essentially destroyed the whole town. Helénsgården was probably built in the beginning of the 18th century and is today protected as a cultural preservation. Its park is used widely as a meeting place and for events such as Sweden&#x27;s National Day celebration.

At the Skövde garrison there is the Garnisonsmuseet (&#x27;Garrison Museum&#x27;), which has military and soldier exhibits from throughout the ages. Additionally, the central soldier register proves an invaluable tool for genealogy.
Skövde Sport History Museum, the newest museum in Skovde, from 2001, is located in the basement of Billingehus. Here you will find the city&#x27;s sports history in sounds, images, old trophies and sports equipment.

The Volvo Museum tells of the start of Sköfde Gjuteri och Mekaniska Verkstad (&#x27;Skövde Foundry and Mechanical Workshop&#x27;) in 1868 and its transformation to today&#x27;s automotive industry. Ryttmästarbostället (&#x27;The Stablemaster&#x27;s Residence&#x27;) is located at Simsjön outside Skövde and is operated by a non-profit organisation. Its purpose is to preserve the buildings, furniture and appliances from the allotment system time and make the collections accessible to the public.

===Music===
Musical events are often organised in the city, such as Loke, a local initiative organising amateur nights when amateurs can play and even borrow instruments. Valhall is a local initiative right beside Loke in the Kulturhus (Skövdes Civic Culture Centre), which sees established bands play, such as Mustasch and Hardcore Superstar.

In wintertime, Arena Skövde is usually used for major artists that attract large audiences. In summer, Karstorp recreation area or Boulognerskogen (&#x27;Boulogner Forrest&#x27;) are often used.

===Theatre===
Theatre productions can be seen at the City Theatre, located in the Kulturhus (Skövdes Civic Culture Centre). There you can see everything from revues to children&#x27;s theatre. Eric Ugglas Theatre is another, in Eric Ugglas plats (&#x27;Eric Uggla&#x27;s Place&#x27;), slightly south of Skövde&#x27;s city centre.

===The Food Festival===
The Food Festival is a festival of Skövde which started in 1990 and is always the last weekend in August. The festival&#x27;s focus is on food that is served in small portions from different restaurants in the city. The restaurants also compete to see who makes the best cuisine as decided by the festival&#x27;s visitors.
The Food Festival also has an amusement park that is located on Sandtorget and a market hall that is located on Hertig Johans Torg.
==Military==

The armoured corps regiment Skaraborg Regiment (P 4) and the logistics corps regiment Göta Logistic Regiment (T 2) are both located in Skövde, as is the Army Combat school.

===History===
Around the year 1900, several Swedish Army units became stationed in Skövde. In 1913 the Skaraborg Regiment also moved there, costing the city a lot of money but also contributing to increased consumption and business. Today the garrison is one of the largest in Sweden.

===Active military units===

There are several military units in Skövde, Skaraborg Regiment (P 4) and the Göta Logistic Regiment (T 2) with the Swedish Armed Forces Logistics and Motor School (&quot;Försvarsmaktens logistik och motorskola&quot;, LogS) and the Land Warfare Centre (MSS). P 4 trains primarily mechanized shooting units and tank units while TrängR trains logistics units of various types. The Land Warfare Centre is for the training of officers in land combat as well as development methods and evaluation practice. The Logistics School is a joint armed school that develops the skills of students and staff from the Army, Navy and Air Force within disciplines of military science, military technology, leadership and individual combat fighting. The Logistics School is located at the Göta Logistic Regiment in Skövde and works together with the Armed Forces Logistics Regiment Centre of Excellence in Logistics. After the recent decision by Defence, Skövde&#x27;s garrison&#x27;s role in the Armed Forces has increased, with smaller units being moved to Skövde, including the Armed Forces Engine School and Logistics School.

New duties for the troops in the city include erecting and manning positions for the Nordic Battle Group, a task force within the European Union&#x27;s battlegroup concept. In essence, Skövde garrison has commitments of approximately 230 soldiers and officers in a logistics battalion, nearly one hundred in an infantry battalion staff and also a couple of independent platoons. Additionally, further troops are assigned to the separate mechanized operation company IA07.

==Education==

===University of Skövde===
The University of Skövde is a university with over 9,000 students that conducts research and has a number of courses focusing across several areas. Currently, the main areas of focus are information technology and systems biology, but a few more courses are under development. The university trains, amongst others, biologists, computer scientists, economists, engineers, cognitive scientists, nurses, linguists and teachers. The University of Skövde profiles itself as having strengths across interdisciplinary courses where technology, natural science and the humanities are united. At the university, there is an ongoing project within the teaching faculty in collaboration with KK-stiftelsen called KompLIT (Competence Development Teacher Education and IT).

===Other education providers===
On the outskirts of the city is also Skövde Garrison, which is one of Sweden&#x27;s largest, with two regiments, Skaraborg Regiment (P 4), Göta Logistic Regiment (T 2), with the Logistics School (&quot;Logistikskolan&quot;) and the Land Warfare Centre (MSS).

The Rescue and Survival College () is a competency-enhancing education and training provider, providing education and certification in rescue, fire safety and international humanitarian work areas. It also provides hotel accommodation and conference facilities for hire.

The Swedish Rescue Training Centre (SRTC, formerly known by its Swedish moniker, Räddningverkets övningsfält) is located in Hasslum, also providing education and training in risk and safety areas.

There are two municipal highschools in Skövde, Västerhöjdsgymnasiet and Kavelbrogymnasiet, which now operates under the name of Gymnasium Skövde. There is also a municipal adult education school (&quot;vuxenutbildning&quot; or Komvux).

==Sports==
Skövde&#x27;s sports scene has long been focused around handball, however the town boasts other sports played at the elite level, albeit with relatively lower profiles. Such sports include baseball, softball and taekwondo.

===Handball===
Skövde&#x27;s handball team play at the highest level for both males and females. IFK Skövde has more recently competed in handball&#x27;s elite series (Elitserie) and 2005 saw the men compete in the final against Sävehof. This was a final that, despite great success during the season, IFK Skövde lost by the narrowest of margins. In 2007 the team was once again in the final, this time against Hammarby IF, who went on to win the match. Skövde HF&#x27;s (Handbollsflickor – handball girls) women&#x27;s team is also in Sweden&#x27;s highest division. Amongst other achievements, the team played five finals over the course of several years and became Swedish champions in 2008 after they beat IK Sävehof 31−24.

==Other==
The North&#x27;s largest gold treasure, &quot;Timboholmsskatten&quot; (&#x27;Timboholm&#x27;s Treasure&#x27;), was found in Skövde in 1904 by two farmhands by the names of Carl Wernlund and Per Rythén, better known as Sjôle-Lotta and Bly-Per. The treasure, which contains 24 carat gold, weighs over 7 kilograms and consists of 16 rings and two ingots. Today, the treasure is in the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm (Historiska museet) and a copy can be found in Skövde City Museum (Skövde stadsmuseum). The treasure dates back to the later Migration Period (around the fifth to the sixth centuries.)

==History==

Västra Götaland County has been inhabited for several thousands of years. The province, Bohuslän, is among the internationally most known because of its pre-historical remains. The oldest remains in Sotenäs Municipality are from around 6000 BC. From the younger Stone Age are several burial monuments (dolmens). From the Bronze Age and Iron Age are many rock carvings, which the province also otherwise is noted for (especially the northern Tanum Municipality).

The name Sotenäs is believed to have originated from around 1000 AD, when also the first steps from the historical hundred, Sotenäs Hundred (or &quot;Härad&quot; in Swedish), can be traced.

With the Christianization of Sweden several churches were erected, starting in the 11th century. The first ones were the churches in Askum and Tossene.

Later, in the 16th century, the industry became dominated by fishing of herring. It dominated the industry for centuries; herring was used in large amounts in Bohuslän - as a basic food but also in the making of oil, wax candles, etc.

In the 19th century the island Malmön was started as a quarry. (Note that &quot;Malm&quot; means &quot;rock&quot; in Swedish). The quarry was kept alive and was of industrial significance until the 1930s.

The coat of arms was granted in 1977 and depicts a halibut. It is built on the insignia for Sotenäs Hundred and has been used for centuries.

<text>Tranemo Municipality (&quot;Tranemo kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Västra Götaland County in western Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Tranemo.

There are twelve original municipal units (as of 1863) in the area. The municipal reform of 1952 created four larger entities. The next reform was implemented in two steps with amalgamations taking place in 1967 and 1974, leading to the present municipality.

The name comes from the bird &quot;Trana&quot;, which means crane.

The coat of arms, granted in 1975, show a crane with a glass blowing belge. Glass blowing is an old industry in the municipality, with the first glass blower established in 1741.

==Controversies==
In 2021, Tranemo Municipality hired a poet to create one poem a week about Tranemo Municipality for 1 year. The project drew heavy criticism because of its cost – nearly 1 million Swedish crowns (SEK). This happened at the same time when municipality demanded 17 million SEK in cost savings from the municipal schools.
This incident resulted in a major crisis in Tranemo municipality.

<text>Trollhättan Municipality (&quot;Trollhättans kommun&quot; or &quot;Trollhättans stad&quot;) is a municipality in Västra Götaland County in western Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Trollhättan.

The municipality was created gradually in 1967, 1971 and 1974 during the last local government reform when the &quot;City of Trollhättan&quot; (itself instituted in 1916) was amalgamated with surrounding municipalities.

The municipality itself prefers to use the denomination &quot;Trollhättans stad&quot; (&quot;City of Trollhättan&quot;) for the entire territory, including rural areas. This is purely nominal and has no effect on its status as a unitary municipality. Until 2012 it was the home of the now defunct Saab Automobile.

<text>Vårgårda Municipality () is a municipality in Västra Götaland County in western Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Vårgårda. It borders Alingsås Municipality to the west, Herrljunga Municipality to the east, Essunga Municipality to the north, Bollebygd and Borås Municipalities to the south.

The local government reform of 1952 formed this municipality through the amalgamation of many small municipalities. It got its name from the only larger built-up locality in the area, Vårgårda. Its territory was not affected by the reform of 1971.

The Swedish religious revival in the 19th century was strong in Vårgårda Municipality, and the Christian climate is today dispersed in many denominations.

Several nationwide-recognized companies, such as Autoliv, are located in the municipality.

==Localities==
The seat Vårgårda, situated between Alingsås and Herrljunga, is the largest locality in this predominantly rural area. Horla and Östadkulle are two other localities, both with fewer than 500 inhabitants in 2018.

<text>Åmål Municipality (&quot;Åmåls kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Västra Götaland County in western Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Åmål.

The present municipality was created in 1971 through the amalgamation of the former &quot;City of Åmål&quot; and the former rural municipality of Tössbo (the latter created in 1952).

==Geography and natural resources==
The city of Åmål is located in a scenic bay of Lake Vänern, the largest lake in Sweden. The municipality has a small archipelago with some 30 islands, called &quot;Tösse skärgård&quot;, to the south of the city. The islands are protected as a nature preserve; many of the islands are wooded, but a few are used for farming. They provide habitat for a number of bird species, including grey heron, osprey, mallard, goldeneye, goosander, the black-throated diver and hobby in the bays; on the cobs are colonies of herring gull, and the common tern; while on the fir-covered islands are capercaillie, woodpeckers and other birds.

Population centers in the municipality include Åmål, Fengersfors, and Tösse.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Åmål Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 12,302 residents, including 9,585 Swedish citizens of voting age. 46.3% voted for the left coalition and 52.5% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Economy==
Fishing was once a major industry, as indicated by the fish appearing on the bottom of the coat of arms. Logging was also of importance. In recent years tourism, especially activities connected to the use of the lake, have increased.

==Sister cities==
Åmål has seven twin towns:

<text>Öckerö Municipality (&quot;Öckerö kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Västra Götaland County in western Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Öckerö on the main island, which is also called Öckerö.

The municipality consists of islands in the Northern Gothenburg Archipelago just outside Gothenburg. With a total area of 26.03 km2 it is one of the smallest municipalities of Sweden.

The municipality is one of very few in Sweden which has not been amalgamated and thus still has the same area as the unit formed out of a parish (&quot;socken&quot;) by the first local government acts of 1862. In the period 1915–1959 there were a number of &quot;municipalsamhällen&quot; (a sort of boroughs within a rural municipality handling matters of urban character) in the municipality.

==Geography==

The municipality consists of ten year-round inhabited islands. They are considered to stretch from the Vinga Lighthouse up to the coastal town of Marstrand in the municipality of Kungälv. The ten islands are named:
#Björkö
#Fotö
#Grötö
#Hyppeln
#Hälsö
#Hönö
#Kalvsund
#Källö-Knippla
#Rörö
#Öckerö

N.B. that &quot;ö&quot; means &quot;island&quot; in Swedish, hence there are many names ending with &quot;ö&quot;. E.g. &quot;Björkö&quot; means &quot;Birch Island&quot;.

Of these, Hönö is the largest with some 4,800 inhabitants, and Öckerö is also fairly large with 3,100. However, all ten are inhabited by people all year around. Most islands have bridge connection between each other. However, there is no road connection to the mainland, just car ferries from western Gothenburg. The ferry connections are good with a dense schedule. A local referendum in 2003 in Öckerö Municipality rejected the plans for a future bridge to the mainland.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Öckerö Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 12,895 residents, including 10,173 Swedish citizens of voting age. 38.3% voted for the left coalition and 60.6% for the right coalition.

==History==
During the Viking Age the islands of Öckerö belonged to the Norwegian kings, and the part of the coast was known as &quot;Älvsyssel&quot;. In the 13th century the King Hakon Hakonarson built himself a house on Öckerö, because he was often around there with his navy.

In 1658 or thereabout, the area became Swedish together with Bohuslän.

In the middle of the 18th century, the fishing of herring blossomed into a full scaled industry, and the islands fishing communities flourished for some 50 years.

In the 1950s the coat of arms were designed. As the main industry has always been fishing, a boat and herring became symbols. The ten herrings correspond to the ten islands.

Ömål, also called öbo, is a Swedish Götamål dialect spoken on the islands of the Öckerö municipality. It has some features of the Gothenburg Swedish dialect (Göteborgska), but also features from English.

Marie railroad, simply known as the &quot;Soo&quot; or &quot;Soo Line&quot;, for the phonetic spelling of &quot;Sault&quot; in Sault Ste. Marie, came through Mylo. On November 18, 1905, crews working from the east and those working from the west met about one mile west of Mylo to complete this agricultural branch of the Soo Line. A Post Office was established in Mylo in 1905 and was in operation until its closing in 2011. The Mylo Post Office also provided the rural route service for the Towner County city of Perth, N.D. in the later years. Mylo was incorporated as a village in 1907. Some notable items from the Mylo City Council Meetings are as follows:

On April 8, 1908, with all members voting yes, that sidewalks be constructed of planks at least 1 3/4 inch in thickness, or shall be of cement construction, and shall be eight feet in width, and properly supported, and be constructed at such grades as shall be approved by the street commissioner.
On September 7, 1910, the clerk was authorized to order five Oliver street lamps for the village. Ole Peterson got paid 10 dollars for lighting the street lamps for the years 1910 and 1911.
On January 3, 1912, Wm. Hazlett was paid one dollar for board of prisoners.
On October 10, 1918, a special meeting was called to prohibit the holding of any public meetings until further notice to prevent the spread of influenza.
On April 12, 1921, motion was made and carried to have hitching posts put up to tie horses to.
On September 23, 1927, a special meeting was held to canvas the votes of a special election on whether or not to construct an electrical distribution system to be used in connection with the hi-line of the Otter Tail Power Co. This would give Otter Tail Power Co. permission to install and operate an electric light, power system and transmission line in the village for the purpose of furnishing electric lights, heat and power to the village and its inhabitants. There were 45 votes cast with all in favor of the construction. 
On January 15, 1937, the village board met and felt that as a result of the legalizing the sale of intoxicating liquor in the State of North Dakota and the adoption of the liquor control ordinance permitting the sale of intoxicating liquor in the village of Mylo, that additional police protection will be needed and to appoint a special officer to maintain order in the village.
In 1954, Mylo signed an agreement with Northwest Bell Telephone Co. so they could put up poles and string wire so the residents could have telephones. Some of the businesses had phones prior to this.

It is not known for certain how Mylo got its name. It is said that it was possibly named after Melvin Small, who owned the land where Mylo was built, or it is named after Father Malo, the first Rolette County priest, or possibly named after the Soo Line agent who was involved in the location of the town site.

At its peak in 1920, Mylo had a peak population of 140. In the 2010 Census, the population of Mylo was shown to be 20, with no businesses in operation. The school in Mylo closed in the spring of 1973 and the last business in Mylo closed its doors in 1986.

<doc id="128770" wikidata="Q158591" url="?curid=128770" title="Flag of Guernsey">
<text>The flag of Guernsey was adopted in 1985 and consists of the red Saint George&#x27;s Cross with an additional gold Norman cross within it. The creation was prompted by confusion at international sporting events over competitors from Guernsey and England using the same flag. It was designed by the Guernsey Flag Investigation Committee led by Deputy Bailiff Sir Graham Dorey. The flag was first unveiled on the island on 15 February 1985. The gold cross represents William the Bastard, Duke of Normandy (who became, after the conquest, William I of England). William purportedly was given such a cross by Pope Alexander II and flew it on his standard in the Battle of Hastings. Since 2000, a red ensign with the cross in the fly has been used as the government&#x27;s civil ensign and as a blue ensign.

==History==
Prior to 1985, Guernsey had no official unique flag and instead used the St George&#x27;s Cross (the flag of England) as its flag when one was officially required. This came about after King Edward VIII granted consent for Guernsey to use the flag of England in 1936. During the German occupation of the Channel Islands, the residents were prevented from displaying official British symbols, but the flag of England was permitted for civilian use. The Government of Guernsey carried out official studies in 1906 and 1935 to determine any unique and identifiable historical flags that Guernsey could use to represent it. In 1983, the Bailiff of Guernsey argued the need for a new flag for Guernsey because of the confusion caused by using the flag of England. The impetus for the flag&#x27;s creation was confusion at the 1982 Commonwealth Games, where Guernsey competed under the flag of England some other nations&#x27; competitors erroneously believed England was entering two teams into the Games.

Research was carried out by Deputy Bailiff Sir Graham Dorey, of Guernsey&#x27;s Flag Investigation Committee. The committee considered a number of designs. It was initially considered that the new flag for Guernsey should contain green, but it was ruled that the colour green has no historical basis in Guernsey aside of being used as a sporting colour by the Guernsey national football team in Muratti matches. Consideration was given to using the coat of arms of Guernsey on a St George&#x27;s Cross but this was rejected on the grounds that the arms would be unidentifiable at a distance. It was also decided that to do so would be to focus on English symbols, not recognising Guernsey&#x27;s independence or Norman history. The committee eventually settled on including a gold cross on top of the St George&#x27;s Cross. The gold cross was chosen as it was a symbol of King William the Conqueror, seen on a banner at the Battle of Hastings, as portrayed on the Bayeux Tapestry. That banner was purportedly given to William by Pope Alexander II as a symbol of his blessing for the Norman Conquest of England along with a request for the clergy of the Church of England to give way to William. The new flag&#x27;s design was to symbolise that the islanders were of Norman descent but loyal to the English (and later British) Crown. In 1985 Queen Elizabeth II, Duke of Normandy, granted a Royal Warrant for the flag to become the official flag of Guernsey. Unveiled on 15 February 1985, the flag was flown for the first time on Liberation Day on 9 May, the 40th anniversary of the Channel Islands&#x27; liberation from German occupation during the Second World War.

Thereafter, the Guernsey flag was used in the Grosse Rocque ceremony, replacing the Union Jack, which had traditionally been raised on Grosse Rocque every August bank holiday. The flag would then fly on the rock continuously for a year before being replaced with a new one. The flag of Guernsey is flown from all of the States of Guernsey buildings except on designated flag-flying days, when the Union Jack is used instead. These days mostly relate to birthdays and anniversaries of senior members of the Royal Family as well as Commonwealth Day and Remembrance Sunday. The flag is also flown on the anniversary of the Battle of Hastings on all public buildings.

The flag provided inspiration for the flag of Alderney in 1993. It has also inspired other symbols. In 2011, the Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue Service adopted a new logo comprising the Cross of St George and gold Norman cross, but defaced by the Maltese Cross of the Venerable Order of Saint John based on the Guernsey flag. In November 2012 the Bailiwick of Guernsey&#x27;s St John Ambulance was elevated to a Commandery within the Order dependent on the Priory of England and the Islands in a church service which included granting a new flag from the British College of Arms including elements of the flag of Guernsey.

The flag is not universally supported. Some Guernsey sports fans complain that the flag lacks Guernsey&#x27;s sporting colour of green or the crest of Guernsey. In the 2000s, a green and white tribar with the coat of arms of Guernsey in the centre was created by Guernsey sports fans to be used as Guernsey&#x27;s unofficial sporting flag.

== Guernsey ensign ==
At the same time as the flag of Guernsey was adopted, the Royal Warrant also provided for creation of a Guernsey civil ensign. This was created as a British red ensign incorporating the Guernsey gold cross. That was created for Guernsey residents and British subjects as an alternative flag of Guernsey as well as to be used as Guernsey&#x27;s merchant ensign. In 2000, the States of Guernsey adopted a blue ensign version of the Guernsey ensign for maritime usage on government vessels.

==Gallery of historical flags==
The previous flag of Guernsey was the St George&#x27;s Cross, which Guernsey was permitted to use in 1936 for its state flag. However, there is evidence to suggest the existence of an even earlier Guernsey flag, used in the mid-19th century. This was a St George&#x27;s cross on a blue-and-white chequered field, with the Union Flag in canton. Further details of its use and official status remain doubtful, however.

<text>Fort Yates is a city in Sioux County, North Dakota, United States. It is the tribal headquarters of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and county seat of Sioux County. Since 1970 the population has declined markedly from more than 1,100 residents, as people have left for other locations for work. The population was 176 at the 2020 census.

==History==
A primarily Native American settlement developed here after a US Army post at this site was established in 1863 as the Standing Rock Cantonment, intended for the US Army garrison to oversee the Hunkpapa and Blackfeet bands, and the Inhunktonwan and Cuthead of the Upper Yanktonai, of the Lakota Oyate. In 1878 the US Army renamed the fort to honor Captain George Yates, who was killed by the Lakota Oyate at the Battle of Little Big Horn in 1876. The town that developed was also known as Fort Yates. The Army post and fort were decommissioned in 1903.

Fort Yates also served as the headquarters of the US Standing Rock Indian Agency, which in the late 19th century was headed by US Indian Service Agent James McLaughlin. Worried about the Hunkpapa Lakota chief Sitting Bull possibly taking part in the Ghost Dance movement, he ordered the arrest of the chief on December 14, 1890. During the bungled event the chief was shot and killed at dawn in his log cabin by agency non-Hunkpapa Dakota police.

Sitting Bull was buried at Fort Yates. In 1953, his family authorized his remains to be exhumed and transferred to a gravesite overlooking the Missouri River near his birthplace at Mobridge, South Dakota. A monument dedicated to Sitting Bull was installed at his burial site at Fort Yates. Another monument, with his bust on a pedestal, overlooks the Missouri River at the Mobridge burial site.

This city has become the tribal headquarters of the federally recognized Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation encompasses it. They founded Sitting Bull College in Fort Yates, a tribal college now named for their noted 19th-century leader. Known also as &quot;Long Soldier&quot;, it is the most populous electoral district of the reservation.

==Geography and climate==
Fort Yates is located on the western bank of Lake Oahe.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the hamlet has a total area of , all land. Fort Yates has a semiarid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;), with hot summers, cold and very dry winters (though sometimes moderated by chinook winds) and substantial diurnal temperature ranges.

<doc id="128778" wikidata="Q2443044" url="?curid=128778" title="Selfridge, North Dakota">
<text>Selfridge is a city in Sioux County, North Dakota, United States and on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. Selfridge was founded in 1911. The population was 127 at the 2020 census. Other settlements near this town include Fort Yates and Porcupine. Previous settlements that have since dissolved are Maple Leaf and Chadwick.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==School System==
The Selfridge Public School District system consists of two main school buildings. Selfridge Elementary serves grades K-6. The high school serves grades 7-12. The school system enrolls around 100 students.

The schools were built in the 1950s to replace the old main school building. The elementary school was once a private school for the St. Philomena Catholic Church.

==Organizations==
The town is now served by the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture), Cedar Soil Conservation District, the senior center, the United States Postal Service, and numerous churches.

==History==
Selfridge was settled in 1911 along a Milwaukee Road branch line that diverged from the railroad&#x27;s Pacific Extension transcontinental route in McLaughlin, South Dakota and ran to New England, North Dakota. The first depot was a stationary boxcar moved into Selfridge in 1917 by the railroad on a flatcar; G.E. Langbein became the first depot agent. The boxcar-depot was in pretty deplorable condition upon arrival; it took quite a bit of work to fix it up. In the early days, trains were used extensively, for long distance travel by Selfridge residents and continued until the later 1940s. Selfridge was dependent on the railroad in the early years. Everything came in by train: groceries, lumber, fruit, coal, meat, machinery, mail and even ice. The city shipped all its produce out by train also. Again, the mail, livestock, grain dairy products etc. The trains were a vital part of Selfridge as a growing community.

The first business, a general store, was started in 1911, followed shortly by the Sioux Lumber Company later in 1911. This made for access to building supplies for other businesses and homes which followed. Some of the first homes were crude shanties until the residents could later build their homes, such as the J.K. Wead home and the B.L. Smestad home. These are still being lived in by families today.

Farmers came to the Selfridge area hoping to make their fortune in flax. The area was open range and cattle had to be herded day and night. The area had good farming ground and excellent ranching hills. Horses were used for pulling wagons and for farming and most of the prairie was broken up with walking plows.
Travel was slow and difficult due to crude prairie trails and lack of roads. Good roads weren&#x27;t really built until the 1930s when W.P.A. was put into effect. The roads were then built with horses and crude machinery.

For the first eight years after it was founded, Selfridge existed as an unorganized community without the benefit of municipal ordinances and local supervision—a real &quot;wild west&quot; sort of environment. Before they incorporated to become a village, the residents of Selfridge fought a losing struggle to have Selfridge designated as the county seat before Sioux County became separated from Morton County. History repeated itself, when again in the 1950s the residents tried to have the county seat relocated from Fort Yates to Selfridge because it is more centrally located. Both times were disappointing defeats.

In 1925, the City of Selfridge had 51 homes and 63 business places.
It contained 2 churches, 4 schools, 3 elevators, 2 garages, 3 implement
dealers, 4 filling stations, 2 welding shops, 1 long distance phone, 1 lawyer,
1 pool hall, 2 banks, 1 public hall, 1 picture show, 4 general stores, 3
grocery and meat stores, 1 blacksmith shop, 1 feed barn, 1 rooming house, 2
restaurants, 4 real estate offices, 2 oil stations, 1 hotel, 1 hardware, 1
newspaper, 1 drug store, 1 barber shop, 2 cream stations, 3 contractors, 1
painter, 2 lumber yards, 2 confectioneries, 1 millinery shop, 1 footlocker, and 1 electric, and
power &amp; light company.

By 1930 the city had more than doubled its population.

During the depression years of the thirties, many local men and area farmers
supported their families by working on W.P.A. (Works Progress Administration). The pay was anywhere from $25 to $42 per month depending on the type of work and job and whether the men furnished their own teams of horses. The city park was started and planted with grass and trees. The City Auditorium was built and sidewalks installed. National Youth Association (NYA) gave many of our young people jobs. They earned $6.00 a month.

A volunteer fire department
has always been in existence in Selfridge, but never formally organized until
1973. Balls and fundraisers were held often to raise money for equipment. Many
of the Selfridge business places and homes have been lost to major fires
through the years.

Farming practices in the Selfridge area have changed drastically over the past 100 years—trash cover on summer fallow, a faster coverage of all stages of farming including seeding, summer fallow, harvesting, etc., as well as chemicals used on weed and insect control, seed variety and treatment. The Cedar Soil Conservation Office should be given credit here as they assisted in dam, dugouts, dike building, planning, surveying and financially. Modern farming practices have cut down on farm labor costs but increased in farm management costs. Farmers and ranchers now spend long hours with the calculators and computers figuring out how to get the best production for the least cost.

In the late &#x27;50s and early &#x27;60s, Selfridge hit its peak population. Much
construction and building was going on in this area. By the 1970s the Selfridge population started going down as did the population of most small towns. People were better able to purchase away from home at a cheaper price.

And the young people started leaving the community. During the later years of 1970 it was even feared by the community that it might have to close the doors on its school. This was the trend across the whole country—people moving from rural to urban settings.

On September 16, 2024, the post office caught fire. The former bank, then grocery store, then post office was a total loss. 
==Transportation==
The main access to the town is using North Dakota Highway 6. The Milwaukee Road line that ran through the town was abandoned in 1983, leaving Selfridge without railway access.

<text>Amidon ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Slope County, North Dakota, United States.

Amidon was the smallest incorporated county seat at the 2000 census.

The original county courthouse was built in 1915. It was also the last county seat in the state to get electricity when Slope Electric Cooperative extended their distribution lines into Amidon in 1950.

Amidon is named after Charles F. Amidon, a federal judge for the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota.

<doc id="128781" wikidata="Q1893073" url="?curid=128781" title="Marmarth, North Dakota">
<text>Marmarth ( ) is the largest city in Slope County in the U.S. State of North Dakota with a population of 101 as of 2020 census. It is situated in the southwestern part of Slope County, along the Bowman County line in the southwestern part of North Dakota, just seven miles east of the Montana border. Marmarth was founded as a railroad town along the Milwaukee Road from Seattle, WA to Chicago, IL. By 1920, Marmarth had over 1,300 residents. The town&#x27;s population declined during most of the 20th century and was only 101 in 2021. There is one restaurant and one bar still located in Marmarth in 2013.

The town is recognized for various historical events, including Native-American Lakota history, the discovery of the Dakota fossil and various other dinosaur skeletons, the attack on James L. Fisk by Sitting Bull, and several visits by former president Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt visited Marmarth on several occasions and killed both his first buffalo and his first grizzly bear by the Little Missouri River in Marmarth. The old ranch house on Hay Creek in which Roosevelt stayed during his visits is still standing. Another visited attraction in town is the “Woman in Stone”, which is a 50-foot rock depicting the face and hairline of a woman.

The town is located 50 air miles and nearly 100 road miles from Theodore Roosevelt National Park. Marmarth is adjacent to the Little Missouri National Grassland, and is also the closest city to Big Gumbo, a 20,000 acre federally owned public wilderness area administrated by the Bureau of Land Management.

Several movies and TV shows have been filmed in the Theodore Roosevelt National Park, including the &quot;Wooly Boys&quot;, &quot;History Hogs&quot; and &quot;The Indomitable Teddy Roosevelt&quot;, all which were filmed in neighboring Billings County.

==Etymology==

The name comes from a combination of letters in the first and middle names of Margaret Martha Finch, granddaughter of Albert J. Earling, president of the railroad at the time. It is nicknamed the “city of trees”, as a result of being one of few forested areas in the Badlands region of Southern North Dakota.

==Geography==
It is located between Bucklin township and Hughes township in the badlands region of North Dakota. It is situated adjacent to the Little Missouri River at the confluence of Little Missouri River, Hay Creek, and Little Beaver Creek. It has an elevation of and is nicknamed “the city of trees” for being an oasis of trees in the treeless Badlands region, and is the only place in the State of North Dakota where limber pines grow.

Marmarth is located at (46.294693, −103.923037). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Marmarth has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

==History==

===Native American history===
The area was originally inhabited by the Lakota- and Crow peoples, which may have been part of the 9th–12th centuries BCE Mound Builders civilization.

On September 2, 1864, Captain James L. Fisk of the Union Army was leading 200 gold-seekers in eighty-eight wagons from North Dakota to Montana. By the Deep Creek, approximately twelve miles east of today&#x27;s Marmarth, the group was attacked by over a hundred Hunkpapa Sioux Indians led by the chief Sitting Bull. Sitting Bull was wounded, but saved by Jumping Bull and White Bull, while six Hunkpapas, ten soldiers, and two civilians were killed in the battle. The Site of Fort Dilts has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1980.

===Theodore Roosevelt===
Theodore Roosevelt was frequently in Marmarth and it is credited as the place where the future president shot his first grizzly bear and also his first buffalo. The old squat ranch house by Hay Creek where the president guested is still standing.

===Homesteading===

Marmarth was a hugely popular place for homesteading during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and was founded in the fall of 1907 as a result of the new Milwaukee Road transcontinental rail line known as the Pacific Extension, as well as other factors such as agriculture, and cheap land. The town was originally laid out on the east side of the Little Missouri River, near where a post office known as Neva and a hotel had already been established. However, due to problems with securing additional land on the east side of the river for a reasonable price, the city was moved to the opposite side in 1908. Later, many pioneers came here as a result of the Dust Bowl and in search of a new life in the American Midwest. Marmarth grew quickly to serve the hundreds of homesteaders who flooded into the area. Because the first two decades of the 20th century were unusually wet, the new settlers reaped harvests of wheat on a scale &quot;that promised to turn even owners of modest farms into wealthy men.&quot; By 1920, Marmarth had 1,318 inhabitants. An auditorium, a theater, a large train station, a newspaper, and paved sidewalks were all established during this time.

During a spring thaw in April 1920, rural Marmarth rancher Jack Miller fled his home on horseback to escape the flooding Beaver Creek. When his horse slipped Miller, who had just one arm, found himself swimming in icy waters until he was able to climb aboard an iceberg. Miller managed to anchor the iceberg against a tree, and he danced on the berg all night in order to stay awake and avoid freezing. In the morning, he found safety at a neighbor&#x27;s house.

The population here once reached 1,300 in the early 20th century, but is now at 140. The town was the largest town on the Milwaukee railroad line in North Dakota by 1911, and was also the fifth largest town west of the Missouri River. Another one of the first pioneers, Michael Zeis (born 1885) of Holdingford, Minnesota described the town: “I also started one main cigar shop, made cigars all by hand in my spare time and sold them at Bowman, Rhame”. Zeis lived in the town from 1908 to 1918, working for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, but left the town when he was drafted for World War I in 1918. The town had its own doctor, pioneer Dr. Frederick A. Bordwell and the town soon opened its own Opera House, Barber Building, the Mystic Theatre in 1914, a car dealership and Canadian Frank Gibbs’ hardware store. The town was also known to jail the notorious Jesse James’ gang, consisting of the Old West outlaws Cole, Bob, and Jim. Gibbs later wrote about the town: “There were two banks, the post office, two hotels, a jewelry store, a gas station, a hospital, the train station, a meat store, a theatre, a car dealership, a laundry, and a hardware store”. By the 1920s, a combination of the end of the agricultural boom occasioned by World War I and a return to more normal (i.e., drier) climatic conditions drove many of the settlers from their farms. At the 1930 census, the town&#x27;s population had declined nearly 50% from a decade earlier. This population decline has continued every census thereafter, with the number of residents in 2010 nearly 10% of the number recorded in 1920.

===Fossil findings===

Marmarth is the location of numerous dinosaur fossil findings, including the Dakota fossil. The Marmarth Historical Society and the Marmarth Research Foundation offer summer courses on archeological areas where triceratops and hadrosaurs have been excavated, including courses on fossil preparation, field techniques, dinosaur fossil preservation, and more. Dakota, a fossilized &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot;, a type of duckbill dinosaur, was discovered near Marmarth in 1999 by Tyler Lyson. The fossil is unique in that soft tissue, skin, and muscle were fossilized as well as bone.

==Politics==
In 2014, it was estimated that 78 percent of the people of Marmarth were Republicans, 19 percent were Democrats, and 3 percent were independents. North Dakota is the only one of the 50 states which does not have voter registration, so exact figures are unavailable.

<doc id="128793" wikidata="Q500153" url="?curid=128793" title="Mark Municipality">
<text>Mark Municipality (&quot;Marks kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Västra Götaland County in southwest Sweden.

The municipal seat is located in the center of Kinna town.

The municipality was created through the Municipal Reform Act of 1971 by the amalgamation of eight smaller municipal entities.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms was created and granted with the municipality in 1974. The colours of Gold and Black on the shield represent power and solidity.

The &quot;grain&quot; represents the history of agriculture in the region.

The &quot;circles&quot; symbolise four cannonballs, representing the wars fought between Denmark and Sweden in the greater Mark region.

The &quot;weaver&#x27;s shuttle-tool&quot; represents the historical tradition of textile workmanship in the region, which the region is famous for nationwide.

== History ==

=== Medieval times ===
The word &quot;Mark&quot; comes from an old documented district called &quot;Mark Härad &quot;that existed in the southern parts of the region sometime during the 13th century.

The word &quot;Mark&quot; is believed to be an old Swedish name for &quot;border&quot; or &quot;edge&quot;. During the medieval times the district of &quot;Mark Härad&quot; (now Mark municipality) was situated right at the border region between the Kingdom of Denmark and Kingdom of Sweden.

Several wars were fought in the region during medieval times, and it is not uncommon that farmers accidentally unearth old remains and weapons when plowing the fields.

The fields close to &quot;Öresten Fortress&quot; have been the place for most of the relic findings. Öresten Fortress was originally built by the Danes, and the first documented nobleman to rule and inhabit the fortress was Tyge Puder (1364-1384/86). The fortress was conquered by the Swedish army during the battle of Öresten in 1470 when the Danish king Kristian the First lost the battle against Sten Sture the Elder

The fortress was later destroyed in early 1500 and is now a protected historical sight open to the public year-round.

In 1682, as a sign of the times, the local governance established a place of execution outside Skene village called Galgbacken (eng: &quot;The hill of hanging&quot;). Thieves were executed there as well as those judged as witches were burned on the stake. In 1934 archeologists found the buried remains of those that were executed.

=== The Industrial Revolution ===
The Mark region was the cradle of Sweden&#x27;s textile industry and has since the late 18th century been known as the Fabric Kingdom due to the widespread textile workmanship that comes from the region. It was from Mark that several of the nationwide travelling salesmen were based, spreading high-quality fabric manufacturing throughout the county. The region later evolved into a national industrial center for sewing, dyeing and textile manufacturing after the industrial revolution.

The biggest textile factories of the time was &quot;Kungsfors Textilfabrik &quot;in central Skene, &quot;Fritsla Textilfabrik&quot; in Fritsla, &quot;Rydal Textilfabrik&quot; in Rydal. As of 2014 none of those factories remain in use but the old factory in &quot;Rydal &quot;has been converted into a museum for the regions textile and entrepreneur heritage.

=== Modern era ===
In 1971 Mark Municipality was created out of a consolidation of eight smaller municipalities. The common name given to the municipality was Mark, signifying the historical events taken place which is also manifested in its shield.

During the early 1980s most of the textile factories had disappeared and only a few remained.

Today there are only three major textile and dyeing factories remaining: &quot;Almedahls&quot; (central Kinna), &quot;Ekelund&quot; (central Horred), &quot;Ludvig Svensson&quot; (outskirts of Kinna).

Throughout Mark municipality the textile heritage has been preserved and the region is famous for its textile &quot;know-how&quot; and specialist production. The region is home to Sweden&#x27;s largest manufacturer of fire hoses, bulletproof materials and filtering equipment.

== Roads and communications ==
Mark Municipality has excellent roads, rail and public transport links to the major cities in the country.

<doc id="128805" wikidata="Q309605" url="?curid=128805" title="Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany">
<text>Ferdinand III (6 May 1769 – 18 June 1824) was Grand Duke of Tuscany from 1790 to 1801 and, after a period of disenfranchisement, again from 1814 to 1824. He was also the Prince-elector and Grand Duke of Salzburg (1803–1805) and Duke and Elector (to 1806, Grand Duke from 1806) of Würzburg (1805–1814).

==Biography==


Ferdinand was born in Florence, Tuscany, into the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. He was the second son of Leopold, then Grand-Duke of Tuscany, and his wife, Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain. Being the Grand Duchy a secundogeniture, when his father was elected Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, Ferdinand succeeded him as Grand Duke of Tuscany, officially taking the office on 22 July 1790.

In 1792, during the French Revolution, Ferdinand became the first monarch to recognize the new French First Republic formally, and he attempted to work peacefully with it. As the French Revolutionary Wars commenced, however, the rulers of Britain and Russia persuaded him to join their side in the War of the First Coalition. Ferdinand provided his allies with passive support but no enthusiasm, and after he witnessed a year of resounding victories by the French, he became the first member of the coalition to give up. In a proclamation dated 1 March 1795, he abandoned the alliance and declared Tuscany&#x27;s neutrality in the war.

His normalization of relations with France helped stabilize his rule for several years but by 1799 he was compelled to flee to Vienna for protection when republicans established a new government in Florence. He was forced to renounce his throne by the Treaty of Aranjuez (1801): Napoleon brushed him aside to make way for the Kingdom of Etruria, created as compensation for the Bourbon Dukes of Parma, dispossessed by the Peace of Lunéville in that same year.

Ferdinand was compensated with the Electorate of Salzburg, the secularized former territory of the Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg. He was also made a Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire (a role which expired with the empire&#x27;s dissolution in 1806), receiving the title and land on 26 December 1802.

On 25 December 1805, Ferdinand had to give up Salzburg as well, which by the Treaty of Pressburg was annexed by his older brother, Emperor Francis II. Ferdinand was then made duke of Würzburg, a new state created for him from the old Prince-Bishopric of Würzburg, while remaining an elector. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, he took the new title of Grand Duke of Würzburg.

On 30 May 1814, after Napoleon&#x27;s fall, Ferdinand was restored as grand duke of Tuscany.

Ferdinand died in 1824 in Florence and was succeeded by his son Leopold.

==Family and children==
In Naples on 15 August 1790 by proxy and in Vienna on 19 September 1790 in person, Ferdinand married firstly his double first cousin, Princess Luisa of Naples and Sicily (1773–1802), daughter of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Maria Carolina of Austria.

Their children were:

* Archduchess Carolina Ferdinanda of Austria (2 August 1793 – 5 January 1802) died in childhood.
* Francis Leopold, Grand Prince of Tuscany (15 December 1794 – 18 May 1800) died in childhood.
* Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany (3 October 1797 – 29 January 1870)
* Archduchess Maria Luisa of Austria (30 August 1798 – 15 June 1857)
* Archduchess Maria Teresa of Austria (21 March 1801 – 12 January 1855)

Their first two children, Carolina and Francis, died at very young ages (eight and five respectively) but the later three prospered under their father&#x27;s care. Luisa died when they were all quite young, on 19 September 1802, together with a stillborn son who was unnamed. Two decades later, in Florence on 6 May 1821, Ferdinand married again, this time to the much younger Princess Maria Ferdinanda of Saxony (1796–1865). She was the daughter of Maximilian, Prince of Saxony, and his wife, Caroline of Parma; she was also his first cousin once removed, as well as the first cousin once removed of the dead Luisa, and the sister of his daughter-in-law Princess Maria Anna of Saxony. Though Ferdinand was likely hoping to produce another male heir, there were no children born of this second marriage.

<text>Streeter is a city in Stutsman County, North Dakota, United States. The population was 149 at the 2020 census. Founded in 1905, Streeter celebrated its centennial in July 2005 with a weekend festival.

The city is at one end of what is considered the straightest road in America, with the other end being Hickson. The road consists of Highway 30 in the west to Highway 46 in the east.

==History==

The post office at present-day Streeter was established as &quot;Bloomenfield&quot; on February 28, 1893, and the town was founded and named Streeter in the spring of 1905, when the homestead owned by Alex Anderson was plotted and sold to the public. The first streets in the city were named after Anderson&#x27;s two daughters, Frances and Florence. Streeter was named in honor of Darwin Reed Streeter, a pioneer newspaper editor and legislator from Emmons County, who was very well known throughout the state.

The town experienced a severe fire on January 12, 1911, which destroyed the city&#x27;s bank, two general stores, and a drug store.

Streeter officially became a city in 1950, and its first mayor was Oscar Seher. The city reached a peak population of 602 that year, a number which has since fallen considerably. In 1955, the community&#x27;s business infrastructure consisted of five churches, three general stores, a drug store, bank, locker plant, two hardware stores, two cream stations, two electric stores, three service stations, two implement dealers, three bulk stations, two cafes, one hotel, one movie theater, a recreation hall, two blacksmith shops, a plumbing supply shop, barber shop, four grain elevators, a lumber yard, a poultry egg and feed store, and two taverns.

The Streeter Centennial was held over the weekend of July 1–3 in 2005. The festivities included class reunions, a parade, flea markets, and antique galleries. It concluded with a golf tournament, and a church service. An estimated 4,000 people attended the three-day event, including 700 Streeter alumni.

<doc id="128819" wikidata="Q929902" url="?curid=128819" title="Avon (county)">
<text>Avon ( ) was a non-metropolitan and ceremonial county in the west of England that existed between 1974 and 1996. The county was named after the River Avon, which flows through the area. It was formed from the county boroughs of Bristol and Bath, together with parts of the administrative counties of Gloucestershire and Somerset.

In 1996, the county was abolished and the area split between four new unitary authorities: Bath and North East Somerset, Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire. The Avon name is still used for some purposes. The area had a population of approximately 1.08 million people in 2009.

== Background ==
The port of Bristol lies close to the mouth of the River Avon which formed the historic boundary between Gloucestershire and Somerset. In 1373, a charter constituted the area as the County of the Town of Bristol, although it continued to fall within the jurisdiction of the two counties for some purposes.

The appointment of a boundaries commission in 1887 led to a campaign for the creation of a county of Greater Bristol. The commissioners, while recommending that Bristol should be &quot;neither in the county of Gloucester nor of Somerset for any purpose whatsoever&quot;, did not extend the city&#x27;s boundaries. The commission&#x27;s timidity was attacked by the &quot;Bristol Mercury and Daily Post&quot;, who accused them of using the &quot;crude method of the Procrustean bed&quot;. The newspaper went on to attack Charles Ritchie, the President of the Local Government Board, and the Conservative government:
Everyone who considered the question on its merits was convinced of the justice of the demand for a Greater Bristol, but... the interests of the Tory party were put before every other consideration and we do not think there is any endeavour to conceal the fact.

Under the Local Government Act 1888 Bristol was constituted a county borough, exercising the powers of both a county and city council. The city was extended to take in some Gloucestershire suburbs in 1898 and 1904.

The Local Government Boundary Commission appointed in 1945 recommended the creation of a &quot;one-tier county&quot; of Bristol based on the existing county borough, but the report was not acted upon.

The next proposals for local government reform in the area were made in 1968, when the Redcliffe-Maud Commission made its report. The commission recommended dividing England into unitary areas. One of these was a new Bristol and Bath Area which would have included a wide swathe of countryside surrounding the two cities, extending into Wiltshire and as far as Frome in Somerset. Following a change of government at the 1970 general election, a two-tier system of counties and districts was proposed instead of unitary authorities. In a white paper published in 1971, one of these counties, &quot;Area 26&quot; or &quot;Bristol County&quot;, was based on the commission&#x27;s Bristol and Bath area, but lacked the areas of Wiltshire. The proposals were opposed by Somerset County Council, and this led to the setting up of a &quot;Save Our Somerset&quot; campaign.

By the time the Local Government Bill was introduced to Parliament, the county had been named &quot;Avon&quot;. The boundaries of the new county were cut back during the passage of Local Government Bill through Parliament. The Local Government Act 1972 received Royal Assent on 26 October 1972.

== Creation ==
The county came into formal existence on 1 April 1974 when the Local Government Act 1972 came into effect. The new county consisted of the areas of:

* The county boroughs of Bristol and Bath,
* Part of the Administrative County of Gloucestershire:
** Kingswood Urban District, Mangotsfield Urban District
** Warmley Rural District, most of Sodbury Rural District and most of Thornbury Rural District
* Part of the Administrative County of Somerset:
** Municipal Borough of Weston-super-Mare
** Clevedon Urban District, Keynsham Urban District, Norton-Radstock Urban District, Portishead Urban District,
** Bathavon Rural District, Long Ashton Rural District, part of Axbridge Rural District and part of Clutton Rural District.

The county was divided into six districts:
*Bristol and Bath had identical boundaries to the former county boroughs.
*In the north, two districts were created:
**the urban districts of Kingswood and Mangotsfield, and the rural district of Warmley formed a single District of Kingswood,
**the rest of the areas transferred from Gloucestershire (the rural districts of mostly Sodbury and mostly Thornbury) became the District of Northavon.
*In the south, there were two districts:
**on the coast: Woodspring (merger of the municipal borough of Weston-super-Mare, the urban districts of Clevedon and Portishead, and the rural districts of Long Ashton and part of Axbridge),
**and in the interior: Wansdyke (merger of the urban districts of Keynsham and Norton-Radstock, and the rural districts of Bathavon and part of Clutton).

To the north the county bordered Gloucestershire, to the east Wiltshire and to the south Somerset. In the west it had a coast on the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel.

The area of Avon was 520 square miles (1,347 km2) and its population in 1991 was 919,800. Cities and towns in Avon included (in approximate order of population) Bristol, Bath, Weston-super-Mare, Yate, Clevedon, Portishead, Midsomer Norton &amp; Radstock, Bradley Stoke, Nailsea, Yatton, Keynsham, Kingswood, Thornbury, Filton and Patchway.

The coat of arms created for the county featured six blue and white waves representing the river Avon and parts of the coats of arms of the incorporated areas. The shield featured a dragon from the arms of Somerset divided into gold and red by a chevron from the arms of Gloucestershire.

The crest combined the unicorn of Bristol with the sword of St. Paul (one of the patron saints of Bath Abbey) and the crown of King Edgar, who was crowned King of England by St. Dunstan in Bath Abbey.

The sea-stags were created for Avon to represent the historic importance of the Avon ports and the Royal Forest which covered a large part of the County. As a heraldic badge, a sea-stag continued to be used by some organisations in the geographical area.

== Demise ==

Avon was one of the counties in the &quot;first tranche&quot; of reviews conducted by the Banham Commission in the 1990s. The Commission recommended that it and its districts be abolished and replaced with four unitary authorities. The Avon (Structural Change) Order 1995 was debated in the House of Commons on 22 February 1995. The Order came into effect on 1 April 1996. The four authorities that replaced Avon are:

# The City and County of Bristol
# South Gloucestershire – formed from the Kingswood and Northavon districts.
# North Somerset – formed from the Woodspring district.
# Bath and North East Somerset – formed from the Bath and Wansdyke districts.

For ceremonial purposes, the post of Lord Lieutenant of Avon was abolished and Bristol regained its own Lord Lieutenant and High Sheriff, while the other authorities were returned to their traditional counties. Suggestions to alter Bristol&#x27;s boundaries (either by drawing new boundaries or by merely incorporating the mostly urbanised borough of Kingswood into it) were rejected.

== Legacy ==

The demise of the County of Avon was the focus of a BBC documentary called &quot;The End of Avon&quot;, produced by Linda Orr and Michael Lund and broadcast in 1996. In 2006, the BBC Somerset presenter Adam Thomas, in a BBC One regional programme &quot;Inside Out West&quot;, investigated why Avon refuses to die. Systems inertia means that the county continues to be included in the databases of large corporations as part of addresses in the area. Some private organisations such as the Avon Wildlife Trust choose to retain their name. The Royal Mail indicated that it is not necessary to include Avon (or any other postal county) as part of any address as it had abandoned their use in 1996.

Some public bodies still cover the area of the former county of Avon: for example, Avon Fire and Rescue Service, the Avon Coroner&#x27;s District, Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust, the West of England Strategic Partnership, Intelligence West, and until 2006 the Avon Ambulance Service, when it merged with the Gloucestershire and Wiltshire ambulance services to form the Great Western Ambulance Service, which subsequently merged with South Western Ambulance Service. The former county and its southern neighbour form the area covered by Avon and Somerset Constabulary (governed by the Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner). Though there is no longer a single council, the four unitary authorities still co-operate on many aspects of policy, such as the Joint Local Transport Plan. Currently, the term &quot;West of England&quot; is used by some organisations to refer to the former Avon area, such as the West of England Local Enterprise Partnership. Avon continued to be used unofficially in boundary reviews for parliamentary constituencies.

The term &quot;CUBA&quot;, the &quot;County (or Councils) that Used to Be Avon&quot;, was coined to refer to the Avon area after abolition of the county. The term Severnside is sometimes used as a substitute for &quot;Avon&quot;, although the term can also be used to refer to the stretch of shoreline from Avonmouth north to Aust, or from Newport to Chepstow. &quot;Greater Bristol&quot; is also used.

The Forest of Avon is a community forest covering part of the area of the four local authorities. Other relics of Avon&#x27;s existence include the Avon Cycleway (first designed and promoted by Cyclebag), an 85-mile (137 km) circular route on quiet roads and cycle paths, which was a precursor of the National Cycle Network. Also, Avon County Council helped fund Sustrans&#x27; first cycleway, the Bristol and Bath Railway Path. The Avon Green Belt has continued in place as a jointly agreed policy in the development plans of the successor local authorities.

In 2016 the government proposed that the four local authorities that replaced Avon come together in a West of England Combined Authority with a &quot;metro mayor&quot; who would oversee a new combined authority, to create a &quot;Western Powerhouse&quot; analogous to the government&#x27;s Northern Powerhouse concept. North Somerset council rejected the proposal but the other three authorities accepted the deal; the combined authority was subsequently established in 2017, with the inaugural mayoral election taking place in the May of that year.

As of 2024, a multi-operator unlimited travel daily or weekly bus ticket called AvonRider covering the former county area was still available, supported by local councils.

<doc id="128824" wikidata="Q1075622" url="?curid=128824" title="Hillsboro, North Dakota">
<text>Hillsboro is a small city in Traill County, North Dakota. It is the county seat of Traill County. The population was 1,649 at the 2020 census. Hillsboro was founded in 1881.

Hillsboro sits in the fertile Red River Valley. Local agriculture has dominated the area&#x27;s economy from the beginning. With its location on Interstate 29, halfway between the two metropolitan centers of Greater Grand Forks and Fargo–Moorhead, Hillsboro has seen steady population growth in recent years and has become somewhat of a bedroom community.

==History==
The area along the Goose River that is now Hillsboro was first settled by German and Norwegian settlers around 1870. In 1880, the present day site of Hillsboro was founded under the name &quot;Comstock&quot;. Local folklore tells of the residents of nearby Caledonia, North Dakota turning away a shabby surveyor because of his appearance. This man was then offered hospitality by residents in the tiny settlement of Comstock. The man turned out to be railroad baron James J. Hill.

Hill was so impressed by the kindness showed to him by the residents of this small community that he decided to place his Great Northern Railway there instead of in Caledonia. The name of Comstock was platted as &quot;Hill City&quot; in September 1880 in honor of Mr. Hill. The city was then renamed &quot;Hillsboro&quot; in 1883 after it was discovered that there was already a &quot;Hill City&quot; elsewhere in Dakota Territory, now a part of South Dakota.

The routing of the railroad through Hillsboro gave the young city the motivation to attempt to have the county seat moved there from Caledonia, which had been the seat of Traill County since its organization in 1875. The ensuing contest grew bitter and heated, with Caledonians arming themselves, posting guards in the town, and organizing a committee for defense. Hillsboro residents took to calling the defense committee Tigers of the Jungle and Irreconcilables.

Caledonia went as far as to bring in a professional campaign speaker, Col. W. C. Plummer, to campaign on behalf of the town. His speeches were well-attended but, despite these efforts, Caledonia lost the county seat to Hillsboro in a 1,291 to 218 vote. The Traill County Courthouse was built in Hillsboro in 1905.

In 2001 Hillsboro experienced sustained 100-mph winds that blew down 2,400 trees and 23 miles of powerline and damaged a quarter of the homes in Hillsboro.

In 2006, Hillsboro celebrated its 125th birthday.

==Economy==
The economy of Hillsboro, like so many other small, rural towns in North Dakota, is heavily dependent on agriculture. When local farmers have a bad harvest, the Hillsboro economy can also suffer. In turn, when the harvest is good, Hillsboro usually prospers. One of the more obvious effects the agricultural community has had on Hillsboro is found at the American Crystal Sugar sugar beet plant directly north of town. The large plant, located on U.S. Highway 81, has been responsible for both an increase in population and a steady stream of available jobs during the last few decades that it has been open. In addition, the local agriculture-based factories of Degelman Industries and Total Ag Industries has spurred a recent demand for a local workforce.

In recent years, Hillsboro has become a bedroom community for the Greater Grand Forks and Fargo-Moorhead metropolitan areas. This has led to an increase in both population and home construction. The local business community has also been growing with the recent addition of new businesses including 3R Floral, Sundae Brew, and Goose River Brewing. Although not the once bustling downtown area (centered at the intersection of Caledonia Avenue and Main Street) it once was, Hillsboro&#x27;s downtown has become a new area of development.

===Economic development===
Local organizations, including the Hillsboro Economic Development Corporation and the Traill County Economic Development Commission work help with the economic development in the area. A portion of local sales tax revenues is set aside to bolster business development. New businesses and entrepreneurs can request grants or low-interest loans to help promote development in the city.

==Education ==
It is within the Hillsboro Public School District 9. The Hillsboro Public Schools system provides residents with an elementary school and a high school.

The high school offers Advanced Placement classes either as Online Classes, dual credit classes in school, or through Lake Region State College, depending on the class. These classes are worth college credit at most in-state colleges and universities.

In 2003, 40% of students met or exceeded grade-level standards in Math, and 76% of students met or exceeded grade-level standards in English, above-average when compared to the state average of 39% and 61%, respectively.

In 2012, Hillsboro joined a cooperative agreement in all sports with Central Valley School in rural Buxton. The schools remain separate for fine arts competitions.

==History==
The post office was established on January 12, 1885 and incorporated in 1895. The peak population was 228 in 1890. The other names it had were Eden and Kelner.

It was originally EDEN, a pioneer settlement founded in 1882 in the NE 1/4 sec. 23-155-55, Eden Twp. It failed to develop, but in 1884 a Great Northern Railroad Station was built there, and a farm post office called KELNER was established at the site. The following year, on January 12, 1885, it was renamed CONWAY when postmaster Norman Kelner adopted the new name. A farm post office named Conway, about two miles to the north, had operated for twenty-seven days in late 1884, and may have had some influence in the naming of the station. The village incorporated in 1895 and reached a peak population of 228 in 1890, with a decline to just 33 in 1980. The elevation is 993, and the Zip Code is 58232. Since October 27, 1961, the post office has been a rural branch of Fordville. Lloyd Bennett Omdahl, a former Tax Commissioner and ND Lt. Governor (1987) was born here in 1931. Kilner is an erroneous spelling.

<text>Burlington is a city in Ward County, North Dakota, United States. It was founded in 1883, the third in a series that included two earlier settlements. Despite this, Burlington is still the oldest city in Ward County, as well as north-western and north central North Dakota. On February 28, 1884, as it was the only city in the then-newly formed Imperial Ward County (now split into Ward, Renville, Mountrail, and Burke counties), it was made the county seat, a position it held until 1888. The population was 1,291 at the 2020 census. Burlington is part of the Minot Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Burlington and its former settlements were founded by James Johnson and James Colton (the men who also settled Larimore, North Dakota) in Dakota Territory in the late 1870s. Earlier settlements were The Forks, and later Colton (named after James Colton), which are considered forerunners of the city. Its current name was given to it by James Johnson during the creation of the post office, and was the name of his hometown of Burlington, Iowa. &quot;The Forks&quot; was used as a name for Burlington, alluding to its geographic location at the confluence of the Des Lacs and Mouse Rivers.

In the early 1890s, the &quot;Burlington Reporter&quot; became the first newspaper in western North Dakota. It would in the future be renamed to the &quot;Minot Daily News&quot;.

In 1997, Raymond Kuntz from Burlington testified before the United States Senate that he believed his son, Richard, committed suicide due to the influence of the band Marilyn Manson.

On January 18, 2002, a severe train derailment east of the city sent a gigantic cloud of anhydrous ammonia toward Minot and Burlington. Power to Burlington, Des Lacs, and Berthold was knocked out due to damage to poles near the derailment site. The power company serving these towns built a temporary connection to a neighboring electric cooperative&#x27;s system to provide limited power until the site was sufficiently cleaned up to permit permanent repairs to be completed. Residents were unable to access radios or televisions due to this, although messages went out advising people to stay inside. One man died and many of the area&#x27;s citizens were sickened by the noxious gas. The incident was one of the more major chemical spills in the country. In early 2006, court cases were heard in Minneapolis, Minnesota, against Canadian Pacific Railway, the owner and operator of the derailed train. The anhydrous ammonia spill was the largest such spill in U.S. history. This incident was used by Eric Klinenberg in his book &quot;Fighting for Air: The Battle to Control America&#x27;s Media&quot; as an example of the failure of mass media, specifically local radio stations, to disseminate information to the public in an emergency.

On June 24, 2011, 80% of the city was evacuated when floodwaters swept through the town during the flooding of the Mouse River, in flooding which also greatly affected Minot. In some cases, many homes were not accessible for months afterward, and some damage to homes and infrastructure still wasn&#x27;t fully repaired as of 2016. Post-flood, most of the homes that were directly next to the Mouse River (and some next to the Des Lacs) were demolished as part of a new flood control plan.

==Geography==
Burlington is located on the Drift Prairie of north central North Dakota directly next to the confluence of the Des Lacs and the Mouse Rivers, in Burlington Township, North Dakota, and Kirkelie Township, North Dakota. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===

==Education==
Burlington&#x27;s school district merged with Des Lacs&#x27; school district in the late 1960s to form United Public School District 7, thus Des Lacs-Burlington High School now serves students living in Burlington. This means that it has since shared a school system with nearby Des Lacs. Children in grades kindergarten through sixth attend school in Burlington, while those in seventh through twelve attend high school in Des Lacs. 
Before 2000, there was a lack of room for the possibility of the seventh and eighth grades being located in Burlington, as the room needed for those grades was not completed until that year in the form of a new junior high wing. Des Lacs-Burlington Elementary School had approximately 500 enrolled students as of the 2008 school year.

<text>Minot ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Ward County, North Dakota, United States, in the state&#x27;s north-central region. It is most widely known for the Air Force base approximately north of the city. With a population of 48,377 at the 2020 census, Minot is the state&#x27;s fourth-most populous city and a trading center for a large part of northern North Dakota, southwestern Manitoba, and southeastern Saskatchewan. Founded in 1886 during the construction of James J. Hill&#x27;s Great Northern Railway, Minot is also known as &quot;Magic City&quot;, commemorating its remarkable growth in size over a short time.

Minot is the principal city of the Minot metropolitan area, a metropolitan area that covers McHenry, Renville, and Ward counties and had a combined population of 77,546 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Minot came into existence in 1886, after the Great Northern Railway laid track through the area. A tent town sprang up overnight, as if by &quot;magic&quot;, giving Minot its first nickname, the Magic City; in the next five months, the population increased to over 5,000, further bolstering the nickname. The town site was chosen by the railroad to be placed on the land of homesteader Erik Ramstad, who was convinced to relinquish his claim and became one of the city leaders. The town was named after Henry Minot, a Great Northern investor, ornithologist, and friend of Hill. Its Arikara name is &quot;niwaharít sahaáhkat&quot;, and its Hidatsa name is &quot;maagada&#x27;ashish&quot; (&quot;Plum Coulee&quot;).

The city was incorporated on July 16, 1887. The Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad (Soo Line) later built a line from Valley City to Canada. While initially their plan was to cross the Souris River at Burlington, local interests and arguments convinced them otherwise; landholders along the new route donated the right-of-way, and the Soo Line reached Minot in 1893.

In 1898, a tornado destroyed the timber Gassman Coulee Bridge near Minot. A passenger train, just three minutes away from crossing the bridge when it collapsed, was able to stop just in time to avoid disaster. Until a new trestle, this time made of steel, was built in 1899, the railroad ferried passengers across the coulee using wagons and buggies that transported them to another train parked on the other side of the coulee.

On July 22, 1920, a tornado passed over Minot and bore down in a coulee southeast of town. The tornado picked up Andy Botz&#x27;s home and hurled it to the ground, killing his wife, breaking Botz&#x27;s shoulder, and slightly injuring the two Botz children who were in the house.

Minot and its surrounding area were wide open from 1905 to 1920. The population grew rapidly due to railroad construction and availability of unclaimed land. Nearly complete court records of Ward County and Minot document the prevalence and different types of criminal activity, and offer strong support for the epithet &quot;crime capitol of North Dakota&quot;. State attorney general William Langer helped clean up the town in 1917–1920, but by the time Prohibition arrived in the 1920s, Minot had become a center of illegal activities associated with the High Third district, exacerbated because the city was a supply hub of Al Capone&#x27;s liquor smuggling operations. The hotbed of alcohol bootlegging, prostitution, and opium dens that sprang up in the downtown area soon led people to nickname Minot &quot;Little Chicago&quot;. Smugglers used a network of tunnels (some previously built for heating or deliveries) to transport and conceal illicit cargo entering from Canada.

The 1950s saw a large influx of federal funding into the region, with the construction of Minot Air Force Base (1956–1957) north of the city, and Garrison Dam (1947–1953) on the Missouri River, about south. In 1969, a severe flood on the Souris River devastated Minot in April. Afterward, the Army Corps of Engineers straightened the river&#x27;s path through the city and built several flood control structures.

On January 18, 2002, a severe train derailment west of the city sent a gigantic cloud of anhydrous ammonia toward Minot and Burlington. One man died and many of Minot&#x27;s citizens were sickened and severely injured by the gas, causing one of the worst major chemical accidents of the country. In early 2006, court cases were heard in Minneapolis, Minnesota, against Canadian Pacific Railway, the owner of the derailed train. The anhydrous ammonia spill was the largest such spill in U.S. history. Eric Klinenberg used the incident in his book &quot;Fighting for Air: The Battle to Control America&#x27;s Media&quot; as an example of the failure of mass media, specifically local radio stations, to disseminate information in an emergency.

The 2011 Souris River flood caused extensive damage throughout the Souris River Valley. On June 21, 2011, KXMC-TV reported that a flood of historic proportions was imminent in the valley, largely due to large dam releases upstream. Around 12,000 people were evacuated. On June 26, flooding exceeded previous records when the river crested at above sea level, above the previous record set in 1881. It is estimated that 20% of Minot sustained damage from the flood; this figure includes over 4,100 homes that were in some way affected, 2,376 extensively damaged, and 805 damaged beyond repair. Burlington was also severely damaged during this time.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

===Neighborhoods===
Minot is commonly divided into three major sections: North Hill, the Mouse River Valley and South Hill. North Hill is the area roughly north of Eleventh Avenue North and Northwest Avenue. South Hill is a broad area south and west of Valley Street and Fifth Avenue South. West of Sixth Street West, South Hill dips sharply to the southwest. South Hill&#x27;s limits are less clearly defined than North Hill&#x27;s. Though the neighborhood levels out past 16th Street South, the name South Hill is generally applied to all areas south up to the city limits. Neighborhoods in the Mouse River Valley include Bel Air, Downtown, Eastwood Park, Oak Park and West Minot.

===Region===
Minot is on the Drift Prairie of northwestern North Dakota. It is at (48.2376127, -101.2790043), about north of Bismarck. The Mouse River, or Souris River, runs through the city west to east.

Important cities in the region for which Minot is the trading center include Burlington, Velva, Garrison, Stanley, Bottineau, Rugby, and New Town.

Minot is almost entirely land; the Mouse River, its oxbow lakes, and a few creeks take up just 0.14% of the city&#x27;s area.

The elevation of the river at the city center is above sea level. The valley sits below the surrounding plains; the elevation at the Minot International Airport on North Hill is . The city has several small horseshoe-shaped oxbow lakes within its limits near the river, created by the Mouse&#x27;s meandering course.

===Grid and address system===
The city is laid out on a grid-based street system. Streets run north–south and avenues run east–west. Streets are numbered by their block distance east or west of Main Street. Avenues are numbered north and south of Central Avenue. There are four city quadrants (NW, SW, SE, NE) to designate the location of any address. Main Street addresses are designated North and South. Central Avenue addresses are designated East and West. The grid system carries over into the rural areas of Ward County, making the county one of only three that do not follow the statewide grid system (the others are Burleigh County and Grand Forks County).

===Mouse River===
The Mouse River divides the city approximately in half, north and south. The valley rises to the plains both north and south of the river. Although there are names for certain features of these hills, such as Anthony Hill on South Hill, there are no general names for these topographical features. The northern rise and the plateau north of it are called North Hill and the southern rise and plateau south of it are called South Hill.

===Climate===

Minot experiences a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;). Like Central Asia, it exhibits great temperature variation. Summers range from warm to moderately hot, with frequent thunderstorm activity. Winters are typically bitterly cold and snowy, with high winds and below-freezing temperatures for weeks at a time.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Railroads====
The railroads that built Minot remain, though Great Northern is now part of the BNSF Railway and the Soo Line is run by the Canadian Pacific Kansas City.

Passenger rail transportation is provided on Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Empire Builder&quot; line, connecting Chicago with Portland and Seattle, which stops at the Minot Amtrak station. Trains make a 20-minute refueling and crew change stop in Minot. Westbound trains are scheduled to arrive daily at 9:06 am local time; eastbound trains are scheduled to arrive daily at 10:53 pm.

====Highways====
Three major U.S. highways run through the city, connecting it to Canada, Montana, and two interstates: US 2, US 52, and US 83.

US 2 runs east–west and is a four-lane divided highway from Minot east to Grand Forks and beyond as well as west to Williston and into Montana. Minot is midpoint along the North Dakota segment of US 2.

US 83 runs north–south through central Minot as Broadway. It is a four-lane divided highway from Minot south to Bismarck and north to Minot Air Force Base. Just north of the main gate at the base, the road reduces to two lanes and crosses the Canada–US border at Westhope, ND, where it becomes Manitoba Highway 83.

US 52 is a two-lane highway that runs southeast–northwest. Southeast from Minot, it follows a slightly circuitous route to Jamestown. US 52 then merges with Interstate 94 (I-94) after Jamestown, heading due east to Fargo. Northwest from Minot, US 52 crosses the Canada–US border at Portal, ND/North Portal, SK, where it becomes Saskatchewan Highway 39.

The Minot Bypass follows alternate alignments of these roads around the city in its northwest and northeast quadrants, with southwest and southeast bypasses in preliminary planning stages.

====Airport====
Minot International Airport is served by three airlines as well as charters and air taxi service around North Dakota.

====Transit====
Local transit is provided by Minot City Transit.

<text>Minot Air Force Base ( ; ) is a United States Air Force (USAF) installation in Ward County, North Dakota, north of the city of Minot via U.S. Route 83. In the 2020 census, the base was counted as a CDP with a total population of 5,017, down from 5,521 in 2010. Minot AFB is the home of two major wings: the 5th Bomb Wing and 91st Missile Wing, both of the Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC).

Originally opened in 1957 as an Air Defense Command (ADC) base, Minot AFB became a major Strategic Air Command (SAC) base in the early 1960s, with both nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missiles and manned bombers and aerial refueling aircraft.

When SAC was inactivated in 1992, the nuclear mission of the base was divided between two commands, with missiles going to the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) and manned bombers to the Air Combat Command (ACC). With the establishment of AFGSC in 2009, missiles and manned bombers (excluding the B-1 Lancer) were transferred from AFSPC and ACC to AFGSC in late 2009 and early 2010.

==History==
Construction of Minot AFB began in May 1956 and it officially opened on January 10, 1957, named for the nearby city of Minot.

===Air Defense Command===
The initial USAF host unit was the Air Defense Command (ADC) 32d Air Base Group, activating on 8 February 1957.

The ADC 32d Fighter Group was the first operational unit at Minot, with its 433d Fighter-Interceptor squadron. However, no aircraft were assigned to the unit, and January 1958 the 433d FIS was inactivated. It was replaced in February 1960 by the 5th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron &quot;(The Spittin&#x27; Kittens)&quot;, transferred to Minot from Suffolk County AFB on Long Island, New York. The 5th FIS flew the F-106 Delta Dart and later the F-15A Eagle.

A Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) facility was built and activated in June 1961. The DC-19 SAGE Data Center was housed in a huge, windowless blast-resistant concrete building with a pair of 275-ton AN/FSQ-7 computers which displayed the live air picture to the many scopes of the weapons and air surveillance operations in the various units on the 2nd floor. The computers processed air surveillance information and sent the data to Air Defense Command units. It was the only two-story SAGE blockhouse in ADC. The Minot SAGE facility was deactivated after less than two years of operation, in May 1963, The facility was then renamed the PRIDE Building (&quot;Professional Results in Daily Effort&quot;) after ADC&#x27;s and SAC&#x27;s alternate motto of the 1960s and 1970s, and became a large office building housing many different organizations.

Renamed Aerospace Defense Command in 1968, ADC F-106 operations continued at Minot until ADC was inactivated in 1979 and replaced by Air Defense Tactical Air Command, a part of Tactical Air Command.

===Strategic Air Command===
Strategic Air Command (SAC) initially had units assigned to Minot AFB in 1958 for air refueling support. The 4136th Strategic Wing was formed 1 September 1958, consisting of the 906th Air Refueling Squadron, followed by the 4136th Combat Defense Squadron that was activated on 1 June 1959. The first SAC KC-135A Stratotanker assigned, nicknamed &quot;Miss Minot,&quot; arrived on 23 September 1959 and remained on base until the 906th Air Refueling Squadron was relocated to Grand Forks AFB in northeast North Dakota in January 1994. This aircraft was notable for its tail flash – &quot;The Sun Never Sets on the 906th&quot;.

The scope of operations grew as the Air Force transferred the 525th Bombardment Squadron from the 19th Bombardment Wing at Homestead AFB, Florida, on March 8, 1961, followed by the first B-52H Stratofortress on 10 July 1961, nicknamed &quot;Peace Persuader&quot;. This was preceded by the activation of the 60th Munitions Maintenance Squadron on 1 December 1960, followed by 4136th Armament &amp; Electronics Maintenance Squadron, 4136th Field Maintenance Squadron, and 4136th Organizational Maintenance Squadron 1 March 1961, with the 4136th Airborne Missile Maintenance Squadron being added in November 1962. Demonstrating the capabilities of the B-52, on 10–11 January 1962 a B-52H from the 4136th Strategic Wing at Minot set a new world distance record, flying unrelieved from Kadena AB, Okinawa to Torrejon AB, Spain.

On 1 February 1963, SAC, as part of a conversion to unit designations with historical significance, activated the 450th Bombardment Wing at Minot and the 720th Bombardment Squadron, along with the formation of the 450th Airborne Missile Maintenance Squadron, 450th Armament &amp; Electronics Maintenance Squadron, 450th Field Maintenance Squadron, and the 450th Organizational Maintenance Squadron simultaneously.
In 1961, the Air Force selected the land around Minot for a new Minuteman I ICBM complex. The 455th Strategic Missile Wing was activated in December 1962 along with the 455th Missile Maintenance Squadron. The 740th and 741st Strategic Missile Squadrons operationally controlled the ICBMs and in January 1963, the 742d Strategic Missile Squadron was activated with a third squadron of Minuteman ICBMS. During the 1970s, the 150 missile sites around the region, from the base, were converted to Minuteman IIIs; a model of the older Minuteman I stands at the Minot AFB main gate.

Command of Minot AFB passed from Air Defense Command to SAC in July 1962 as the base&#x27;s primary mission changed from air defense to strategic deterrence. The new command unit, the 810th Air Division was organized along with the 862d Combat Support Group as the host unit for the base. Units assigned to the 862d Combat Support Group were the 862d Civil Engineering Squadron, the 862d Combat Defense Squadron (later redesignated 862d Security Police Squadron), the 862d Food Service Squadron (later redesignated 862d Services Squadron), 862d Operations Squadron (later redesignated 862d Communications Squadron), 862d Supply Squadron and 862d Transportation Squadron, The 862d Medical Group was also formed and reported to the Commander, 810th Air Division.

In July 1968, the 450th Bombardment Wing and 455th Strategic Missile Wing were inactivated, being from Travis AFB, California, when jurisdiction of Travis was assumed by the Military Airlift Command and the 91st Strategic Missile Wing from Glasgow AFB, Montana, when it closed. These changes were in line with the Air Force policy of keeping active those units with the most illustrious histories. The 23d Bombardment Squadron assumed operational control of all B-52 aircraft for the 5th Bombardment Wing. Unit Designations Assigned at Minot on June 25, 1968 were the 5th Bombardment Wing and 23rd Bombardment Squadron, 5th Airborne Missile Maintenance Squadron, 5th Armament &amp; Electronics Maintenance Squadron (later redesignated as the 5th Avionics Maintenance Squadron), 5th Field Maintenance Squadron, 5th Organizational Maintenance Squadron &amp; the 5th Munitions Maintenance Squadron. 91st Strategic Missile Wing [Minuteman], 91st Missile Maintenance Squadron.

On July 2, 1969 the 862d Medical Group was renamed the USAF Hospital. Minot, and the 862d Services Squadron was inactivated; its functions were assumed by the 862d Combat Support Group.

The 810th Strategic Aerospace Division was inactivated 30 June 1971, and was replaced by the 5th Bombardment Wing.
The 862d Combat Support Group was inactivated on July 31, 1972, with host unit duties being taken over by the 91st Combat Support Group (SAC). Under SAC policy, missile wings were fixed in locations, where aircraft units were considered a mobile and the host units were assigned to the missile wings. Units assigned to the 91st Combat Support Group were the 91st Civil Engineering Squadron, the 91st Security Police Squadron, 91st Communications Squadron, 91st Supply Squadron and 91st Transportation Squadron, The USAF Hospital, MINOT.

The 4th Airborne Command &amp; Control Squadron (ACCS) at Ellsworth AFB, SD maintained two EC-135 Airborne Launch Control Center (ALCC) aircraft on forward deployed alert at MAFB for Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) coverage of Minuteman ICBM Wings at Malmstrom AFB, MT; Minot AFB, ND; and Grand Forks AFB, ND. The ALCS provided a survivable launch capability for Minuteman ICBMs if their ground-based Launch Control Centers were incapacitated or destroyed.

Late in 1973 a second Alert Parking Ramp (&quot;Christmas Tree&quot;) was added across runway 29, to the south. The 416th Bombardment Wing, from Griffiss AFB in central New York, maintained two B-52G aircraft with AGM-28B Hound Dog Missiles and two KC-135A aircraft along with two KC-135 Aircraft from the 380th Bombardment Wing at Plattsburgh AFB in northeast New York. On 2 January 1975, the 57th Air Division was activated at MAFB, and on 30 September 1975, the 91st Missile Maintenance Squadron was replaced by the 91st Field Missile Maintenance Squadron, and the 91st Organizational Missile Maintenance Squadron.

Following the Iran hostage crisis of 1979–81, SAC tasked the former 57th Air Division to organize the Strategic Projection Force. The 57th AD became the host unit, providing logistical, security, administrative and other support services to the 5th BMW, 91st SMW and tenant organizations.

In the early 1990s, the base prepared for change as the Air Force directed reorganization, and the 5th Bomb Wing assumed host base responsibilities.

====Cold War aircraft incidents====
*A KC-135A tanker (AF Ser. No. 58-0026) from March AFB crashed shortly after takeoff from Minot AFB on 17 January 1968, killing 12 of the 13 on board. Major General Charles M. Eisenhart, vice commander of the Fifteenth Air Force, was at the controls and over-rotated at takeoff in low visibility, inducing a stall. The survivor, a steward, was badly burned and later succumbed. On a staff visit from March AFB, the aircraft was departing for Glasgow AFB, Montana.
*In the early hours of October 4, 1968, a Minot B-52H (AF Ser. No. 60-0027) was on approach, completing an overnight training mission with six aboard. It lost power to four engines and crashed in a field east, with four fatalities and two survivors. Among the dead was a lieutenant colonel just days from retirement, and the squadron clerk, on his first B-52 orientation ride.
*A B-52H (AF Ser. No. 61-0037) crashed shortly after a midday takeoff on 21 January 1969 and burst into flames on a farm about west of the runway, killing all six crew members. An incorrect preflight fuel load distribution caused a stall on takeoff after a climb to and it made several pitch gyrations prior to the crash.
*During a training flight on March 10, 1969, a Minot F-106A (AF Ser. No. 59-0014) crashed into the western portion of Lake Sakakawea, about southwest of the base. The pilot ejected safely to land and the plane sank below the frozen surface. It was not located until over 35 years later, in September 2004, after an extended search by a local surveyors&#x27; group.
*While being refueled on the ramp early on 14 November 1975, a B-52H (61-0033) caught fire and exploded. Two refueling personnel were killed and the aircraft was destroyed.

===Post-Cold War===

On June 1, 1992, Air Combat Command (ACC) was formed, following the inactivation of the Strategic Air Command. ACC absorbed the former assets of SAC, along with command responsibilities for the Eighth Air Force, and through it, the 5th Bomb Wing and host command of Minot AFB.

In 1993 control of the ICBM force was transferred by ACC to Air Force Space Command; the 91st Missile Wing was assigned to AFSPC on July 1, 1993.

====Global Strike Command====
The 91st Missile Wing was transferred to the new Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) on December 1, 2009, and the 5th Bomb Wing officially transferred to AFGSC on February 1, 2010.

====Nuclear weapons incident====

On August 30, 2007, a B-52 took off from Minot AFB carrying six cruise missiles with W-80 nuclear warheads to Barksdale AFB in northwest Louisiana. No base personnel nor the crew knew the nuclear weapons were aboard. This incident received international attention. An investigation found that this was an isolated incident and that only a few people had information on the whereabouts of the missiles.

While U.S. policy is to neither confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons, Air Force officials acknowledged the presence of nuclear weapons on the base, including the W80-1 warhead.

====Nuclear inspection and consequences====
On July 12, 2008, three Air Force officers fell asleep while in control of an electronic component that contained old launch codes for nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles, a violation of procedure, Air Force officials said. The Air Force said the launch codes were outdated and had been deactivated before the incident, but it was still a violation of protocol, prompting an investigation. It was the fourth incident within a year involving problems with secure handling of components of America&#x27;s nuclear weapons. The incident occurred during the changing out of components used to facilitate secure communications between an underground missile-control facility and missile silos near Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, according to Col. Dewey Ford, a spokesman for the Air Force Space Command in Colorado. One of the parts, a code component, is for storage and processing. It is considered classified by the Air Force. A code component was removed from the equipment at the remote missile-control facility and replaced with a new code component. That made the old component inoperable, but an Air Force source said old launch codes were still contained in the part.

Under standard procedure, the four-officer crew of the facility is supposed to keep the component secure until it is returned to the base. Ford said the crew took the component to a building above the facility and locked the component in a lockbox. Then, three of the four crew members fell asleep. This violated Air Force procedure, which calls for at least two of the crew members to remain awake while in control of the component. At the time they were asleep, the crew and the component were in a locked building that is guarded by at least one armed airman at all times. The airmen were asleep for two to three hours, Ford said. The component was later returned to the Minot base, and the investigations of procedural violations were started by Air Force Space Command, the 20th Air Force and the National Security Agency. The investigation revealed the codes were not compromised, according to the Air Force. The codes had remained secured, and the crew was inside an area protected by Air Force security at all times, the investigation concluded. The incident, which was first made public by the Project on Government Oversight, was the fourth misstep involving the handling of America&#x27;s nuclear weapons in one year. The three officers were given non-judicial punishment and subsequently discharged from the Air Force.

In fall 2009, Minot suffered another embarrassment when the newly formed 69th Bomb Squadron failed its Initial Nuclear Surety Inspection (INSI). As a result, both the 5th Bomb Wing and 5th Operations Support Squadron Commanders were relieved of command by the 8th Air Force Commander under the later discredited &quot;perfection is the standard&quot; philosophy. Subsequently, it was determined the 8th Air Force Commander had acted vindictively, outside his authority and used the firings to deflect attention away from institutional, organizational and leadership failings at both 8th Air Force and Air Combat Command.

Another incident first reported in May 2013 by the Associated Press revealed that 17 officers in charge of maintaining the base&#x27;s Minuteman III nuclear missiles were &quot;sidelined&quot; for numerous violations of safety procedures. The deputy commander of the base complained of &quot;rot&quot; in the staff&#x27;s discipline and command structure. The Associated Press obtained an internal email from the deputy commander and the news of the incident had garnered the attention of then Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who &quot;demanded details&quot; of the incident. The unit in charge of maintaining the nuclear missiles performed poorly during an inspection that took place in March 2013. Following the release of the Deputy Commander&#x27;s strongly worded internal email, the Air Force began investigating the incident further.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the Minot AFB CDP has a total area of , of which, is land and (4.17%) is water.

Due to the winter conditions, a phrase spread within the USAF regarding why people would not wish to be stationed there: &quot;Why not Minot? Freezin&#x27;s the reason!&quot; In response, people who loved Minot AFB, and the surrounding area, came up with the comeback &quot;-41 Keeps the RIF-Raf out.&quot;

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 7,599 people, 2,112 households, and 1,943 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 1,053.9 people per square mile (406.9/km). There were 2,441 housing units at an average density of 338.5/sq mi (130.7/km). The racial makeup of the CDP was 79.1% White, 10.2% African American, 0.7% Native American, 2.8% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 2.8% from other races, and 4.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino people of any race were 6.2% of the population.

There were 2,112 households, out of which 68.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 86.5% were married couples living together, 3.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 8.0% were non-families. 6.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.25 and the average family size was 3.40.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 36.3% under the age of 18, 24.0% from 18 to 24, 38.1% from 25 to 44, 1.5% from 45 to 64, and 0.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22 years. For every 100 females, there were 120.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 126.6 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $32,255, and the median income for a family was $32,306. Males had a median income of $22,458 versus $16,659 for females. The per capita income for the town was $11,629. About 5.0% of families and 5.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.2% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

==Public schools==
For its dependents, the base has three schools operated by Minot Public Schools: two elementary (Dakota and North Plains) and a middle school (Memorial), built in the 1960s. High school students (grades 9–12) attend Minot North High School in the city of Minot, south. MNHS recently opened in August 2024; base students previously attended Minot High School, which was split between two campuses: Central (1918, downtown) for freshmen and sophomores, and Magic City (1974, on the southwest side of the city) for juniors and seniors. Magic City is now Minot High School (9–12) and Central is the district&#x27;s fourth middle school.
