<doc id="125892" wikidata="Q4844923" url="?curid=125892" title="Paul Drake (character)">
<text>Paul Drake is a fictional private detective in the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; series of murder mystery novels by Erle Stanley Gardner. Drake is described as tall and slouching, nondescript (as suits his profession), and frequently wearing an expression of droll humor. He often smoked cigarettes especially when he had a subject of interest under surveillance. He is friend and right-hand man to Mason, a highly successful criminal defense lawyer in Los Angeles.

==Novels==
Drake is frequently described as &quot;lanky&quot; and slightly &quot;fish-faced&quot; or &quot;pop-eyed&quot;. In talking with Mason, he generally likes to slouch in an armchair with his back over one arm and his legs over the other. The conversations often include complaints about his indigestion from living on cheap hamburgers and bad coffee when working for Mason. His appearance and attitude are deceptive, however: he is personally dedicated, and physically tough in a fight.

==Films==
Allen Jenkins played a variation on the Paul Drake character, referred to as Spudsy Drake, in two 1935 films based on Gardner novels, &quot;The Case of the Curious Bride&quot; and &quot;The Case of the Lucky Legs&quot;.

Eddie Acuff took over the Spudsy role in the 1936 film &quot;The Case of the Velvet Claws&quot;.

Garry Owen played the investigator, now known simply as Paul Drake, in 1936&#x27;s &quot;The Case of the Black Cat&quot;, and Joseph Crehan took over in 1937&#x27;s &quot;The Case of the Stuttering Bishop&quot;.

==Television==
In 1957, the CBS television network launched a &quot;Perry Mason&quot; series based on Gardner&#x27;s characters, which ran until 1966. William Hopper auditioned for both the Mason and Drake roles. &quot;He was perfect as Drake, and we got him,&quot; recalled executive producer Gail Patrick Jackson.

&quot;Paul Drake in the Erle Stanley Gardner books was an entirely different character,&quot; Hopper said in 1962. &quot;I play him my way. Now I&#x27;m amused to read Gardner&#x27;s new books. Paul Drake now comes out like me!&quot;

&quot;Just as Raymond Burr will &quot;always&quot; be Perry Mason, Bill Hopper will &quot;always&quot; be Paul Drake,&quot; wrote Brian Kelleher and Diana Merrill in their chronicle of the TV series. &quot;He defined the role.&quot;

A running gag on the series is that although Paul Drake is a &quot;wolf&quot; who dates every woman he can, the only woman he does not date is Della Street whom he always respectfully refers to as &quot;Hi Beautiful&quot; - in deference to the romantic chemistry displayed between Perry and Della.

In the short-lived 1973–74 revival, &quot;The New Perry Mason&quot;, Paul Drake was played by Albert Stratton.

In the successful series of Perry Mason television films that began in 1985, the Paul Drake character was part of the back story: his son Paul Jr. served as Mason&#x27;s private investigator in the first nine films. Drake&#x27;s son was played by William Katt, the real-life son of Barbara Hale, who played Della Street both in the TV series and the TV movies.

In HBO&#x27;s 2020 &quot;Perry Mason&quot; reimagining, Paul Drake is African-American, starting the series as an LAPD uniformed police officer. He is portrayed by actor Chris Chalk.

<text>Silver City is a town in Grant County, New Mexico, United States. It is the county seat and the home of Western New Mexico University. As of the 2010 census the population was 10,315. As of the 2020 census, the population was 9,704.

==History==


The valley that is now the site of Silver City once served as an Apache campsite. With the arrival of the Spaniards, the area became known for its copper mining. After the American Civil War, a settlement developed and became known as &quot;La Ciénega de San Vicente&quot; (the Oasis of St. Vincent). With a wave of American prospectors, the pace of change increased, and Silver City was founded in the summer of 1870. The founding of the town occurred shortly after the discovery of silver ore deposits at Chloride Flat, on the hill just west of the farm of Captain John M. Bullard and his brother James. Following the silver strike, Captain Bullard laid out the streets of Silver City, and a bustling tent city quickly sprang to life. Although the trajectory of Silver City&#x27;s development was to be different from the hundreds of other mining boom towns established during the same period, Captain Bullard himself never lived to see even the beginnings of permanence, as he was killed in a confrontation with Apache less than a year later, on February 23, 1871.

The town&#x27;s violent crime rate was substantial during the 1870s. However, Grant County Sheriff Harvey Whitehill was elected in 1874, and gained a sizable reputation for his abilities at controlling trouble. In 1875, Whitehill became the first lawman to arrest Billy the Kid, known at the time under the alias of Henry Antrim. Whitehill arrested him twice, both times for theft in Silver City (Sheriff Whitehill testified to the Justice of the Peace that he believed Henry Antrim did not do the actual stealing the second time arrested, but assisted in the hiding of the property stolen by Sombrero Jack. Whitehill would later claim that the young man was a likeable kid, whose stealing was a result more of necessity than criminal. His mother is buried in the town cemetery. In 1878, the town hired its first town marshal, &quot;Dangerous Dan&quot; Tucker, who had been working as a deputy for Whitehill since 1875. Butch Cassidy and his Wild Bunch were also reported to frequent the Silver City saloons in the late 1800s.

Mrs. Lettie B. Morrill, in a talk given to the Daughters of the American Revolution chapter in Silver City on September 19, 1908, stated, &quot;John Bullard was placed in the first grave dug in Silver City, having been killed while punishing the Indians for an attack upon the new town; the brothers were prospectors about the country for many years. The last one left for the old home about 1885, saying, &#x27;It is only a matter of time until the Indians get me if I stay here.&#x27;&quot; Silver City was also the starting point for many expeditions hunting treasures, such as the Lost Adams Diggings.

The communities of Silver City and Pinos Altos developed as 19th century miners recovered easily extracted copper, gold and silver from ore deposits of the area. Standard-gauge Santa Fe Railroad reached Silver City in 1886, and Silver City, Pinos Altos and Mogollon Railroad was incorporated in 1889 to build a railway north to Mogollon. Construction was limited to of grading until Wisconsin-based Comanche Mining and Smelting purchased the railroad in 1903 after horse-drawn ore transport became uneconomical. The Silver City smelter burned shortly after purchase, but was rebuilt with three blast furnaces and a reverberatory furnace to handle 225 tons of ore per day. Regular SC, PA&amp;M steam service was briefly running from 1907 to 1913.

In 1893, New Mexico Normal School was established. It was later known as New Mexico Western State Teachers College. In 1963, it was renamed Western New Mexico University. Today, WNMU offers eight graduate degrees, 41 baccalaureate degrees, and 18 associate degree and certificate programs. The WNMU&#x27;s mascot is referred to as the Mustangs. Recognition for the university includes the 2003 Zia Award, the 2005 Best Practice Award (for the School of Education), the 2006 Chamber of Commerce Large Business of the Year Award, the 2008 Piñon Award, and the 2008 Compañero Award.

The town had originally been designed with the streets running north to south. It was also built without adequate planning for storm water runoff. Businesses sprang up, and people learned to deal with the inconveniences of the summer rain. Silver City was built with high sidewalks in the downtown area to accommodate high flood waters. However, uncontrolled grazing and deforestation over time in the surrounding area contributed to higher levels of runoff. During the night of July 21, 1895, a heavy wall of water rushed through the downtown business district, leaving a trail of destruction. A ditch lower than the original street level was created in what was once known as Main Street. Businesses on Main Street began using their back doors on Bullard Street as main entrances and eventually, were permanently used as the new front entrances. To this day, the incorrect odd/even addressing conventions on the east side of Bullard Street are a reminder that the buildings were addressed on Main Street originally, not Bullard Street. Main Street now ends near the back of the Silver City Police Station, where the Big Ditch Park begins.

The Mimbres Mogollon Indians (A.D. 200–A.D. 1140/50) once lived in the area, along with other prehistoric groups, including the Salado. Mimbres archaeological sites are located throughout Silver City and surrounding communities on federal, state, municipal, and private property. Collecting of Mimbres pottery by landowners and others is documented as far back as the late 1870s. Collecting was something that occurred during a Sunday picnic in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Some individuals maintained collections that can now be seen in the Smithsonian, and other museums, who sent individuals out to acquire collections in the nearby Mimbres Valley during the early 1900s. Others dug into the ancient sites and used the pottery they found for target practice—something that occurred into the 1930s according to oral histories. Collecting, and the looting, of Mimbres Mogollon sites did not stop with archaeological research conducted on private lands during the 1920s, 1930s, and 1970s, nor with the passage of the New Mexico &quot;Burial Law&quot; in 1989. Sadly, unlawful looting continues to this day, and many prehistoric sites have been badly damaged or obliterated.

The Apaches occupied areas in the vicinity of Silver City beginning in the late 1500s to early 1600s, based on archaeological evidence.

==Geography==
Silver City is located near the center of Grant County, at the southern foot of the Pinos Altos Range of the Mogollon Mountains. The town is east of the Continental Divide, in the valley of San Vicente Arroyo, a south-flowing tributary of the Mimbres River.

U.S. Route 180 passes through the northern part of the town, leading east to Bayard and northwest to Cliff. New Mexico State Road 90 (Hudson Street) leads southwest to Lordsburg and Interstate 10, and State Road 15 leads north to Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Silver City has a total area of , of which , or 0.17%, is water.

==Geology==
The local geology of the Silver City area is complex. Sedimentary gravels are found in the form of the alluvial Mangas Valley gravels. Metamorphic schist and gneiss are also found. The downtown area is mostly made of granite outcrops.

==Climate==
The climate of Silver City is classified as Csa (Mediterranean with hot summers and cool winters) in the Köppen system. A Mediterranean climate is unusual in New Mexico, occurring only in a small upland area in the southwestern part of the state. Silver City&#x27;s climate is characterized by moderate rainfall in fall and winter (October to February, a dry spring (March to June), and rains from (July to September) in what is called the North American Monsoon. The monsoon, which is irregular from year to year, impacts mostly southern New Mexico and south-eastern Arizona in the United States. 

During the period from 1901 to 1964, when readings were taken at the city center (which is cooler and wetter than outlying and lower-elevation districts nearby), the coldest temperature recorded was on January 11, 1962, and the hottest on July 5, 1901.

Silver City was founded as a mining town. George Hearst built a smelter after the Silver City, Deming and Pacific narrow-gauge railway reached Silver City in 1883. The Santa Fe Railroad provided standard gauge rail service in 1886, and Commanche Mining and Smelting extended the two-foot narrow-gauge Silver City, Pinos Altos and Mogollon Railroad to Pinos Altos in 1906 (none of which are still in existence).

The nearby mining operations, formerly Phelps Dodge, are still the basis for the local economy. In 2006, the Chino and Tyrone mines produced of copper. Mine employment was 1,250, with wages and salaries totaling $73 million. However, a Phelps-Dodge spokesman remarked in 2007 that &quot;based on current economic projections, our properties in New Mexico will not be operating in 25 years&quot;. Phelps Dodge was acquired by international mining firm Freeport-McMoRan in March 2007, and operations at the Chino and Tyrone operations are continuing under the Freeport name.

Tourism, retirement and trade are the other major components of Silver City&#x27;s economy. In 2006, an average three-bedroom, house sold for about $160,000.

==Points of interest==
The Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument is about north of Silver City, via the winding NM 15. At the monument, the remains of Indigenous inhabitants within five caves in a cliff can be found. They were built sometime between 1275 and 1300 AD by the Mogollon culture. In addition to ancient ruins, there are plenty of places to camp, hike and fish within the Gila Wilderness.

The Catwalk is a trail enclosed by a metal walkway that suspends above the Whitewater Canyon hugging the canyon walls. It follows water-pipe routes built by miners in 1893. When the pipes needed repair, the miners walked on them. Visitors can explore the walkway and trail, picnic, and enjoy the river. It is located north of Silver City on U.S. Route 180 near Glenwood.

There are several lakes in the area. Lake Roberts covers about north of Silver City on NM 15 near the NM 35 junction. Other lakes in the Silver City area include Bill Evans Lake, Snow Lake, Wall Lake, Bear Canyon Dam. Anglers have a choice of brown and rainbow trout, catfish, and bass. In addition, several mountainous rivers can be found nearby. Some of note are the Gila River, Negrito Creek, San Francisco River, and Willow Creek.

The Kneeling Nun is a natural rock formation located about to the east of Silver City along NM 152. Several legends have developed explaining its origin.

Nearby is Fort Bayard Historic District, about eight miles east of Silver City, off of US Highway 180. The District was the location of Fort Bayard, which was established in 1866 to station soldiers of the US Army in proximity to mining camps in the region. In later years the fort was converted to an Army hospital, specializing in the treatment of tuberculosis. In the early 1920s it became a US Veterans Hospital under the Veterans Administration. The property was sold to the State of New Mexico in 1965, which used the facility as a State Hospital. With the construction of a newer hospital in 2010, the property was vacated. Fort Bayard then became home to a museum, maintained by the Fort Bayard Historic Preservation Society. The museum personnel offer tours of both the building and the grounds on a regular schedule.

Silver City was the finish line in the 2001 movie &quot;Rat Race&quot;, in which several people race from Las Vegas to a locker containing $2 million in Silver City&#x27;s train station. In reality, there is no longer a train station in Silver City and the movie was not filmed in Silver City.

Silver City is mentioned in the 2007 film &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot;, whose screenplay was written by Paul Thomas Anderson and was based on the 1927 novel &quot;Oil!&quot; by Upton Sinclair. Upton Sinclair based his novel on the experiences of Edward L. Doheny, a prospector and oil tycoon living in the Silver City area (near Kingston). In the movie, Henry, the man claiming to be Daniel&#x27;s half-brother, says that he had been in Silver City for two years drilling on his own.

In the 1956 film &quot;Backlash&quot;, Jim Slater, played by Richard Widmark, goes to Silver City with the body of the deputy sheriff he killed. Slater is advised to leave quickly for Tucson by the sheriff, who advises him, &quot;We don&#x27;t like gunfights here in Silver City.&quot;

In the 2010 road trip movie &quot;Friendship!&quot;, the two friends Veit and Tom are stopped and arrested by Silver City police because of driving naked. Since their car was damaged, they need to rest and raise some money in Silver City for getting their car repaired before being able to continue their trip.

The film &quot;A Boy Called Sailboat&quot; was filmed in and near Silver City in 2016.

In 1954 the film &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;, one of the first pictures to advance the feminist social and political point of view, centers on a long and difficult strike, based on the 1951 strike against the Empire Zinc Company in Grant County. The movie featured many local non-actors, the movie was not filmed in Silver City but in a small town 17 miles east.

Silver City is also mentioned in several episodes in the highly rated ABC series &quot;The Rifleman&quot; (1958–1963) starring Chuck Connors in the title role. Silver City is located some distance from the fictional North Fork town where the program is situated.

<text>Santa Rosa is a city in and the county seat of Guadalupe County, New Mexico, United States. The population was 2,848 at the 2010 census. It lies between Albuquerque and Tucumcari, situated on the Pecos River at the intersection of Interstate 40 and U.S. Route 54 and 84. The city is located on the western edge of the Llano Estacado or &quot;staked plains&quot; of eastern New Mexico and west Texas.

==History==
The first Euro-American settlement in the area was Agua Negra Chiquita, &quot;Little Black Water&quot; in Spanish, in 1865. The name was changed in 1890 to Santa Rosa (Spanish for &quot;Saint Rose&quot;), referring to a chapel that Don Celso Baca (the founder of the city) built and named after both his mother Rosa and Saint Rose of Lima. The &quot;Rosa&quot; may also refer to the roses in the story of Our Lady of Guadalupe and is indicative of the Catholicism of the Spanish colonizers who settled in the area.

At the turn of the twentieth century, Santa Rosa was not the largest settlement within the region. Puerto de Luna, approximately ten miles south, held the county seat for Guadalupe County. Santa Rosa was smaller than Puerto de Luna until 1901 when the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad was extended into Santa Rosa from the east, quickly followed by arrival of the El Paso and Northeastern Railway in February 1902, from the southwest, thereby creating a transcontinental connection. As the terminus and interchange point of the two railroads, a thriving community quickly developed (The interchange was moved to Tucumcari after 1907). The county seat was moved to Santa Rosa from PDL in 1903.

The east–west highway through the town was designated as U.S. Route 66 in 1926, and the increase in traffic made the community a popular rest stop with motels and cafes. Santa Rosa&#x27;s stretch of Route 66 is part of film history. When John Steinbeck&#x27;s epic novel, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, was made into a movie, director John Ford used Santa Rosa for the memorable train scene. Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) watches a freight train steam over the Pecos River railroad bridge, into the sunset. It was also one of the shooting scenes for &quot;Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw&quot; starring Lynda Carter in the role of Bobbi Jo.

Santa Rosa was the childhood home of author Rudolfo Anaya, and is the basis for the fictional town of Guadalupe in his autobiographical novel &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot;.
==Geography==
Santa Rosa has many natural lakes, an anomaly in the dry desert climate surrounding it. These are sinkholes that form in the limestone bedrock of the area and fill with water, and thus the lakes are connected by a network of underground, water-filled tunnels. The most famous of these is Blue Hole, a popular spot for diving, where cool water forms a lake over deep.

Santa Rosa is located near the center of Guadalupe County at (34.942166, -104.683981).

&quot;Route 66&quot; remains the name of the main east–west thoroughfare through the city, referring to former U.S. Route 66, which lost its official designation in 1985.

New Mexico State Road 91 runs south to Puerto de Luna.

<text>Lordsburg is a city in and the county seat of Hidalgo County, New Mexico, United States. Hidalgo County includes the southern &quot;bootheel&quot; of New Mexico, along the Arizona border. The population was 2,335 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Lordsburg was founded in 1880 on the route of the Southern Pacific Railroad. The Continental Divide Trail starts at the Crazy Cook Monument and travels through Lordsburg. 
Local lore is that Billy the Kid washed dishes in Lordsburg hotel kitchens such as the Stratford Hotel, and La Fonda, the historic &quot;inn at the end of the Santa Fe Trail&quot; during his teenage years.

===New Mexico state song===
Lordsburg is the birthplace of the official New Mexico state song, &quot;O Fair New Mexico&quot;. It was written by Lordsburg resident Elizabeth Garrett, the blind daughter of famed sheriff Pat Garrett. In 1917, Governor Washington Ellsworth Lindsey signed the legislation making it the official state song. In 1928, John Philip Sousa presented Governor Arthur T. Hannett and the people of New Mexico an arrangement of the state song embracing a musical story of the Indian, the cavalry, the Spanish and the Mexican.

===Lordsburg Municipal Airport===
The Lordsburg Municipal Airport (KLSB) began operations in the mid-1920&#x27;s and was the first airport in New Mexico. Initially the airfield was a cleared parcel of land where pilots could takeoff and land in any direction. Dirt runways were later constructed. In 1927, Lordsburg was one of the stops on Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s transcontinental &quot;Spirit of Saint Louis&quot; air tour. In the early 1950s the airport was served by the original Frontier Airlines (1950–1986) which flew DC-3s on a route from El Paso to Phoenix that included stops at Las Cruces, Deming, and Lordsburg, as well as Clifton, Safford, and Tucson, Arizona. In the mid-1970&#x27;s one runway had to be relocated to permit the construction of Interstate 10 around Lordsburg and a new paved runway was then constructed. The airport is owned by the City of Lordsburg and is southeast, about one mile outside the city limits.

===World War II===
Lordsburg held as many as 1,500 Japanese Americans in a Japanese American internment camp operated by the U.S. Army during World War II. On July 27, 1942, shortly after the Lordsburg Internment Camp was opened, Private First Class Clarence Burleson, a sentry at the facility, allegedly shot two Japanese American internees under questionable circumstances. One of the victims, Hirota Isomura, apparently died instantly. The other, Toshiro Kobata, died before dawn. After a military investigation and court-martial, Burleson was found to have lawfully killed the two men. The camp operated until July 1943. The incident inspired an episode of the new &quot;Hawaii 5-0&quot; series, &quot;Ho&#x27;oani Makuakane&quot;, Episode 4/9 (original air date December 13, 2013).

The camp at Lordsburg also held captured German and Italian soldiers.

<text>Hobbs is a city in Lea County, New Mexico, United States. Its population was 40,508 at the 2020 census, increasing from 34,122 in 2010.

Hobbs is the principal city of the Hobbs, New Mexico micropolitan statistical area, which includes all of Lea County.

==History==
Hobbs was founded in 1907 when James Isaac Hobbs established a homestead and named the settlement. In 1910, the Hobbs post office opened, with James Hobbs as the first postmaster. By 1911, about 25 landowners lived in Hobbs.

The small, isolated settlement expanded rapidly following the discovery of oil by the Midwest Oil Company in 1927. A refinery was built the following year, and in 1929, the town of Hobbs was officially incorporated. At the peak of this oil boom, over 12,000 people lived in Hobbs. When the Great Depression hit, oil prices dropped and the population fell to only about 3,000 in 1931. A few years later, though, activity picked up in the oilfields and the population climbed to about 14,000 in 1940.

On June 23, 1938, seven local men were killed and five more injured when an explosive charge used in oil drilling detonated prematurely.

Following the outbreak of World War II, Hobbs Army Airfield was built north of town in 1942. In 1948, the city bought the air base and converted it into the Hobbs Industrial Air Park, which is still used for soaring competitions.

The first college in Hobbs opened in 1956. It was initially the First Baptist College, and in 1962, it became the College of the Southwest. The name was changed again to University of the Southwest in 2008. A second college, New Mexico Junior College, opened in 1966.

An ordinance was passed in Hobbs in November 2022 to prevent abortion clinics from operating. This ordinance was overwritten by a 2023 state law prohibiting local abortion bans.

==Geography==

<text>A nocturne is a musical composition that is inspired by, or evocative of, the night.

==History==
The term &quot;nocturne&quot; (from French &quot;nocturne&quot; &quot;of the night&quot;) was first applied to musical pieces in the 18th century, when it indicated an ensemble piece in several movements, normally played for an evening party and then laid aside. Sometimes it carried the Italian equivalent, &quot;notturno&quot;, such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s Notturno in D, K.286, written for four lightly echoing separated ensembles of paired horns with strings, and his &quot;Serenata Notturna&quot;, K. 239. At this time, the piece was not necessarily evocative of the night, but might merely be intended for performance at night, much like a serenade. The chief difference between the serenade and the notturno was the time of the evening at which they would typically be performed: the former around 9:00 pm, the latter closer to 11:00 pm.

In its form as a single-movement character piece usually written for solo piano, the nocturne was cultivated primarily in the 19th century. The first nocturnes to be written under the specific title were by the Irish composer John Field, generally viewed as the father of the Romantic nocturne that characteristically features a cantabile melody over an arpeggiated, even guitar-like accompaniment. However, the most famous exponent of the form was Frédéric Chopin, who wrote 21 of them. Later composers to write nocturnes for the piano include Gabriel Fauré, Alexander Scriabin, Erik Satie (1919), Francis Poulenc (1929), as well as Peter Sculthorpe. In the movement entitled &#x27;The Night&#x27;s Music&#x27; (&#x27;Musiques nocturnes&#x27; in French) of &quot;Out of Doors&quot; for solo piano (1926), Béla Bartók imitated the sounds of nature. It contains quiet, eerie, blurred cluster-chords and imitations of the twittering of birds and croaking of nocturnal creatures, with lonely melodies in contrasting sections. American composer Lowell Liebermann has written eleven Nocturnes for piano, of which No.6 was arranged by the composer as Nocturne for Orchestra. Other notable nocturnes from the 20th century include those from Michael Glenn Williams, Samuel Barber and Robert Helps.

Other examples of nocturnes include the one for orchestra from Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s incidental music for &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1848), the set of three for orchestra and female choir by Claude Debussy (who also wrote one for solo piano) and the first movement of the Violin Concerto No. 1 (1948) by Dmitri Shostakovich. French composer Erik Satie composed a series of five small nocturnes. These were, however, far different from those of Field and Chopin. In 1958, Benjamin Britten wrote a Nocturne for tenor, seven obbligato instruments and strings, and the third movement of his Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings (1943) is also titled &quot;Nocturne&quot;.

Nocturnes are generally thought of as being tranquil, often expressive and lyrical, and sometimes rather gloomy, but in practice pieces with the name &quot;nocturne&quot; have conveyed a variety of moods: the second of Debussy&#x27;s orchestral &quot;Nocturnes&quot;, &quot;Fêtes&quot;, for example, is very lively, as are parts of Karol Szymanowski&#x27;s &quot;Nocturne and Tarantella&quot; (1915) and Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji&#x27;s &quot;Symphonic Nocturne for Piano Alone&quot; (1977–78).

<text>Distributive justice concerns the socially just allocation of resources, goods, opportunity in a society. It is concerned with how to allocate resources fairly among members of a society, taking into account factors such as wealth, income, and social status. Often contrasted with just process and formal equal opportunity, distributive justice concentrates on outcomes (substantive equality). This subject has been given considerable attention in philosophy and the social sciences. Theorists have developed widely different conceptions of distributive justice. These have contributed to debates around the arrangement of social, political and economic institutions to promote the just distribution of benefits and burdens within a society. Most contemporary theories of distributive justice rest on the precondition of material scarcity. From that precondition arises the need for principles to resolve competing interest and claims concerning a just or at least morally preferable distribution of scarce resources.

In social psychology, distributive justice is defined as perceived fairness of how rewards and costs are shared by (distributed across) group members. For example, when some workers work more hours but receive the same pay, group members may feel that distributive justice has not occurred. To determine whether distributive justice has taken place, individuals often turn to the behavioral expectations of their group. If rewards and costs are allocated according to the designated distributive norms of the group, distributive justice has occurred.

==Types of distributive norms==
Five types of distributive norm are defined by Donelson R. Forsyth:

# Equality: Regardless of their inputs, all group members should be given an equal share of the rewards/costs. Equality supports that someone who contributes 20% of the group&#x27;s resources should receive as much as someone who contributes 60%.
# Equity: Members&#x27; outcomes should be based upon their inputs. Therefore, an individual who has invested a large amount of input (e.g. time, money, energy) should receive more from the group than someone who has contributed very little. Members of large groups prefer to base allocations of rewards and costs on equity.
# Power: Those with more authority, status, or control over the group should receive more than those in lower level positions.
# Need: Those in greatest needs should be provided with resources needed to meet those needs. These individuals should be given more resources than those who already possess them, regardless of their input.
# Responsibility: Group members who have the most should share their resources with those who have less.

==Theories of distributive justice==
The listed theories below are some of the most prominent theories within the field. With this in mind, the list is in no way to be considered exhaustive for distributive justice theory.

=== Justice as fairness ===
In his book &quot;A Theory of Justice,&quot; John Rawls outlines his famous theory about justice as fairness. The theory consists of three core components:

# the equality of people in rights and liberties;
# the equality of opportunities for all; and
# an arrangement of economic inequalities focused on benefit maximisation for those who are least advantaged.

==== The just &#x27;basic structure&#x27; ====
Building a modern view on social contract theory, Rawls bases his work on an idea of justice being rooted in the &quot;basic structure&quot;, constituting the fundamental rules in society, which shape the social and economic institutions, as well as the governance. This basic structure is what shapes the citizens’ life opportunities. According to Rawls, the structure is based on principles about basic rights and duties that any self-interested, rational individual would accept in order to further his/her own interests in a context of social cooperation.

==== The original position ====

Rawls presents the concept of an &quot;original position&quot; as a hypothetical idea of how to establish &quot;a fair procedure so that any principles agreed on will be just.&quot; In his envisioning of the original position, it is created from a judgement made through negotiations between a group of people who will decide on what a just distribution of primary goods is (according to Rawls, the primary goods include freedoms, opportunities, and control over resources). These people are assumed to be guided by self-interest, while also having a basic idea of morality and justice, and thus capable of understanding and evaluating a moral argument. Rawls then argues that procedural justice in the process of negotiation will be possible via a nullification of temptations for these people to exploit circumstances so as to favor their own position in society.

==== Veil of ignorance ====

This nullification of temptations is realised through a &quot;veil of ignorance&quot;, which these people will be behind. The veil prevents the people from knowing what particular preferences they will have by concealing their talents, objectives, and, most importantly, where in society they themselves will end up. The veil, on the other hand, does not conceal general information about the society, and the people are assumed to possess societal and economic knowledge beyond the personal level. Thereby, such veil creates an environment for negotiations where the evaluation of the distribution of goods is based on general considerations, regardless of place in society, rather than biased considerations based on personal gains for specific citizen positions. By this logic, the negotiations will be sensitive to both those who are worst off, given that a risk of being in that category yourself will incentivize protection of these people, but also the rest of society, as one would not wish to hinder maximal utilisation for these in case you would end up in higher classes.

==== Basic principles of a just distribution ====
In this original position, the main concern will be to secure the goods that are most essential for pursuing the goals of each individual, regardless of what this specific goal might be. With this in mind, Rawls theorizes two basic principles of just distribution.

The first principle, the liberty principle, is the equal access to basic rights and liberties for all. With this, each person should be able to access the most extensive set of liberties that is compatible with similar schemes of access by other citizens. Thereby, it is not only a question of positive individual access but also of negative restrictions so as to respect others’ basic rights and liberties.

The second principle, the difference principle, addresses how the arrangement of social and economic inequalities, and thus the just distribution should look. Firstly, Rawls argues that such distribution should be based on a reasonable expectation of advantage for all, but also to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged in society. Secondly, the offices and positions attached to this arrangement should be open to all.

These principles of justice are then prioritised according to two additional principles:

=== Utilitarianism ===

In 1789, Jeremy Bentham published his book &quot;An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation.&quot; Centred on individual utility and welfare, utilitarianism builds on the notion that any action which increases the overall welfare in society is good, and any action that decreases welfare is bad. By this notion, utilitarianism&#x27;s focus lies with its outcomes and pays little attention to how these outcomes are shaped. This idea of utilisation maximisation, while being a much broader philosophical consideration, also translates into a theory of justice.

==== Conceptualising welfare ====
While the basic notion that utilitarianism builds on seems simple, one major dispute within the school of utilitarianism revolved around the conceptualisation and measurement of welfare. With disputes over this fundamental aspect, utilitarianism is evidently a broad term embracing many different sub-theories under its umbrella, and while much of the theoretical framework transects across these conceptualisations, using the different conceptualisation have clear implications for how we understand the more practical side of utilitarianism in distributive justice.

Bentham originally conceptualised this according to the hedonistic calculus, which also became the foundation for John Stuart Mill&#x27;s focus on intellectual pleasures as the most beneficial contribution to societal welfare. Another path has been painted by Aristotle, based on an attempt to create a more universal list of conditions required for human prosperity. Opposite this, another path focuses on a subjective evaluation of happiness and satisfaction in human lives.

=== Egalitarianism ===

Based on a fundamental notion of equal worth and moral status of human beings, egalitarianism is concerned with equal treatment of all citizens in both respect and in concern, and in relation to the state as well as one another. Egalitarianism focuses more on the process through which distribution takes place, egalitarianism evaluates the justification for a certain distribution based on how the society and its institutions have been shaped, rather than what the outcome is. Attention is mainly given to ways in which unchosen person circumstances affect and hinder individuals and their life opportunities. As Elizabeth Anderson defines it, &quot;the positive aim of egalitarian justice is...to create a community in which people stand in relation of equality to others.&quot;

The main issue with egalitarian conceptions of distributive justice is the question concerning what kind of equality should be pursued. This is because one kind of equality might imply or require inequality of another kind. Strict egalitarianism, for instance, requires the equal allocation of material resources to every person of a given society. The principle of strict equality therefore holds that even if an unequal distribution would make everyone better off, or if an unequal distribution would make some better off but no one worse off, the strictly egalitarian distribution should be upheld. This notion of distributive justice can be critiqued because it can result in Pareto suboptimal distributions. Thus, the Pareto norm suggests that principles of distributive justice should result in allocations in which it is no longer possible to make anyone better off without making anyone else worse off. This illustrates a concern for the equality of welfare, which is an ex post conception of equality as it is concerned with the equality in outcomes. This conception has been critiqued by those in favour of ex ante equality, that is equality in people´s prospects, which is captured by alternative conceptions of equality such as those that demand equality of opportunity.

While much academic work distinguishes between luck egalitarianism and social egalitarianism, Roland Pierik presents a synthesis combining the two branches. In his synthesis, he argues that instead of focusing on compensations for unjust inequalities in society via redistribution of primary goods, egalitarianism scholars should instead, given the fundamental notion upon which the theory is built, strive to create institutions that creates and promotes meaningful equal opportunities from the get-go. Pierik thus moves egalitarianism&#x27;s otherwise reactive nature by emphasising a need for attention to the development of fundamentally different institutions that would eradicate the need for redistribution and instead focus on the initial equal distribution of opportunities from which people then themselves be able to shape their lives.

===Marxism===
The slogan &quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs&quot; refers to distributive justice in Marxism according to Karl Marx. In Marxism-Leninism according to Vladimir Lenin the slogan &quot;He who does not work, neither shall he eat&quot; is a necessary approach to distributive justice on the path towards a communist society.

== Application and outcomes ==

===Outcomes===
Distributive justice affects performance when efficiency and productivity are involved. Improving perceptions of justice increases performance. Organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) are employee actions in support of the organization that are outside the scope of their job description. Such behaviors depend on the degree to which an organization is perceived to be distributively just. As organizational actions and decisions are perceived as more just, employees are more likely to engage in OCBs. Perceptions of distributive justice are also strongly related to the withdrawal of employees from the organization.

=== Wealth ===

Distributive justice considers whether the distribution of goods among the members of society at a given time is subjectively acceptable.

Not all advocates of consequentialist theories are concerned with an equitable society. What unites them is the mutual interest in achieving the best possible results or, in terms of the example above, the best possible distribution of wealth.

===Environmental justice===

Distributive justice in an environmental context is the equitable distribution of a society&#x27;s technological and environmental risks, impacts, and benefits. These burdens include exposure to hazardous waste, land appropriation, armed violence, and murder. Distributive justice is an essential principle of environmental justice because there is evidence that shows that these burdens cause health problems, negatively affect quality of life, and drive down property value.

The potential negative social impacts of environmental degradation and regulatory policies have been at the center environmental discussions since the rise of environmental justice. Environmental burdens fall disproportionately upon the Global South, while benefits are primarily accrued to the Global North.

===In politics===
Distributive justice theory argues that societies have a duty to individuals in need and that all individuals have a duty to help others in need. Proponents of distributive justice link it to human rights. Many governments are known for dealing with issues of distributive justice, especially in countries with ethnic tensions and geographically distinctive minorities. Post-apartheid South Africa is an example of a country that deals with issues of re-allocating resources with respect to the distributive justice framework.

=== Catholic Church ===
Distributive justice is also fundamental to the Catholic Church&#x27;s social teaching, inspiring such figures as Dorothy Day and Pope John Paul II.

==Criticism==

=== Friedrich von Hayek ===

Within the context of Western liberal democracies in the post-WWII decades, Friedrich von Hayek was one of the most famous opposers of the idea of distributive justice. For him, social and distributive justice were meaningless and impossible to attain, on the grounds of being within a system where the outcomes are not determined deliberately by the people but contrarily spontaneity is the norm. Therefore, distributive justice, redistribution of wealth, and the demands for social justice in a society ruled by an impersonal process such as the market are in this sense incompatible with that system.

In his book &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;, there can be found considerations about social assistance from the state. There, in talking about the importance of a restrictive kind of security (the one against physical privation) in front of one that necessarily needs to control or abolish the market, Hayek poses that &quot;there can be no doubt that some minimum of food, shelter, and clothing, sufficient to preserve health and the capacity to work, can be assured to everybody&quot;. Providing this type of security is for Hayek compatible with individual freedom as it does not involve planning. But already in this early work, he acknowledges the fact that this provision must keep the incentives and the external pressure going and not select which group enjoys security and which does not, for under these conditions &quot;the striving for security tends to become higher than the love of freedom&quot;. Therefore, fostering a certain kind of security (the one that for him socialist economic policies follow) can entail growing insecurity as the privilege increases social differences. Notwithstanding, he concludes that &quot;adequate security against severe privation, and the reduction of the avoidable causes of misdirected effort and consequent disappointment, will have to be one of the main goals of policy&quot;.

Hayek dismisses an organizational view that ascribes certain outcomes to an intentional design, which would be contrary to his proposed spontaneous order. For this, Hayek famously firstly regards the term social (or distributive) justice as meaningless when it is applied to the results of a liberal market system that should yield spontaneous outcomes. Justice has an individual component for Hayek, is only understood in the aggregation of individual actions which follow common rules, social and distributive justice are the negative opposite as they need a command economy. Secondly, following Tebble&#x27;s (2009) view, the concept of social justice is for Hayek a reminiscence of an atavistic view towards society, that has been overcome by the survival capacity of the catallactic order and its values.

The third Hayekian critique is about the unfeasibility of attaining distributive justice in a free market order and this is defended on the basis of the determinate goal that all distributive justice aims to. In a catallactic order, the individual morality should freely determine what are distributive fairness and the values that govern economic activity, and the fact that it is impossible to gather all the individual information in a single pursuit for social and distributive justice results in realizing the fact that it cannot be pursued. Lastly, Hayek claims for the incompatibility between the free market and social justice, for, in essence, they are different kinds of inequalities. The former is one determined by the interaction of free individuals and the latter by the decision of an authority. Hayek will, on ethical grounds, choose the former.

=== Robert Nozick ===

One of the major exponents of the libertarian outlook toward distributive justice is Robert Nozick. In his book Anarchy, State, and Utopia he stresses how the term distributive justice is not a neutral one. In fact, there is no central distributor that can be regarded as such. What each person gets, he or she gets from the outcomes of Lockean self-ownership (a condition that implies one&#x27;s labor mixed with the world), or others who give to him in exchange for something, or as a gift. For him, &quot;there is no more a distributing or distribution of shares than there is a distribution of mates in a society in which persons choose whom they shall marry&quot;. This means that there can be no pattern to which to conform or aim. The market and the result of individual actions provided the conditions for libertarian principles of just acquisition and exchange (contained in his Entitlement Theory) will have as a result a distribution that will be just, without the need for considerations about the specific model or standard it should follow.

<doc id="125909" wikidata="Q442100" url="?curid=125909" title="Procedural justice">
<text>Procedural justice is the idea of fairness in the processes that resolve disputes and allocate resources. One aspect of procedural justice is related to discussions of the administration of justice and legal proceedings. This sense of procedural justice is connected to due process (U.S.), fundamental justice (Canada), procedural fairness (Australia), and natural justice (other Common law jurisdictions), but the idea of procedural justice can also be applied to nonlegal contexts in which some process is employed to resolve conflict or divide benefits or burdens. Aspects of procedural justice are an area of study in social psychology, sociology, and organizational psychology.

Procedural justice concerns the fairness (formal equal opportunity) and the transparency of the processes by which decisions are made, and may be contrasted with distributive justice (fairness in the distribution of rights and outcomes), and retributive justice (fairness in the punishment of wrongs). Hearing all parties before a decision is made is one step which would be considered appropriate to be taken in order that a process may then be characterised as procedurally fair. Some theories of procedural justice hold that fair procedure leads to equitable outcomes, even if the requirements of distributive or restorative justice are not met. It has been suggested that this is the outcome of the higher quality interpersonal interactions often found in the procedural justice process, which has shown to be stronger in affecting the perception of fairness during conflict resolution.

== Giving group members a voice ==
Procedural justice deals with the perceptions of fairness regarding outcomes. It reflects the extent in which an individual perceives that outcome allocation decisions have been fairly made. The use of fair procedures helps communicate that employees are valued members of the group. Procedural Justice can be examined by focusing on the formal procedures used to make decisions. Procedural justice, a subcomponent of organizational justice, is important in communication and in the workplace because it involves fair procedures, it allows the employees to have a say in the decision process, it gives employees fair treatment, and allows them to have more input in the appraisal process. Additionally, research by Tom R. Tyler and colleagues found that giving disgruntled group members a voice regardless of whether it is instrumental (i.e., a voice that affects the decision-making process) or non-instrumental (i.e., a voice that will not have any weighting on the decision-making process) is sometimes enough for a process to be viewed as fair.

The ability and right to a voice is linked with feelings of respect and value, which emphasizes the importance of the interpersonal factors of procedural justice. This is important in the workplace because employees will feel more satisfied and respected, which can help to increase job task and contextual performance. There is an emphasis on the interpersonal and social aspects of the procedure, which result in employees feeling more satisfied when their voices are able to be heard. This was argued by Greenberg and Folger. Procedural justice also is a major factor that contributes to the expression of employee dissent. It correlates positively with managers&#x27; upward dissent. With procedural justice there is a greater deal of fairness in the workplace.

== Leventhal&#x27;s Rules ==
In 1976, Gerald S. Leventhal attempted to articulate how individuals create their own cognitive maps about the procedures for allocating rewards, punishment, or resources in a given interaction setting or social system (be it a courtroom, classroom, workplace, or other context). He postulated seven categories of structural components to these procedures, and six justice rules by which the &quot;fairness&quot; of each component is evaluated. The seven types of structural components are: selection of agents, setting ground rules, gathering information, decision structure, appeals, safeguards, and change mechanisms. The six justice rules are: consistency, bias suppression, accuracy, correctability, representativeness, and ethicality. These became widely used and referenced, and known as &quot;Leventhal&#x27;s Rules.&quot;

== Rawls on procedural justice ==
In &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;, philosopher John Rawls distinguished three ideas of procedural justice:
#&quot;Perfect procedural justice&quot; has two characteristics: (1) an independent criterion for what constitutes a fair or just outcome of the procedure, and (2) a procedure that guarantees that the fair outcome will be achieved.
#&quot;Imperfect procedural justice&quot; shares the first characteristic of perfect procedural justice—there is an independent criterion for a fair outcome—but no method that guarantees that the fair outcome will be achieved.
#&quot;Pure procedural justice&quot; describes situations in which there is no criterion for what constitutes a just outcome other than the procedure itself.

== Evaluating the fairness of different procedural systems ==
There are three main approaches to evaluating whether a particular system of justice is fair: the outcomes model, the balancing model, and the participation model.

=== Outcomes model ===
The idea of the outcomes model of procedural justice is that the fairness of process depends on the procedure producing correct outcomes. For example, if the procedure is a criminal trial, then the correct outcome would be conviction of the guilty and exonerating the innocent. If the procedure were a legislative process, then the procedure would be fair to the extent that it produced good legislation and unfair to the extent that it produced bad legislation. This has many limitations. Principally, if two procedures produced equivalent outcomes, then they are equally just according to this model. However, as the next two sections explain, there are other features about a procedure that make it just or unjust. For example, many would argue that a benevolent dictatorship is not (as) just as a democratic state (even if they have similar outcomes).

=== Balancing model ===
Some procedures are costly. The idea of the balancing model is that a fair procedure is one which reflects a fair balance between the costs of the procedure and the benefits that it produces. Thus, the balancing approach to procedural fairness might in some circumstances be prepared to tolerate or accept false positive verdicts in order to avoid unwanted costs (political) associated with the administration of criminal process. Ronald Dworkin argued that a properly balanced procedure is one that values peoples&#x27; rights and treats persons equally.

=== The participation model ===
The idea of the participation model is that a fair procedure is one that affords those who are affected by an opportunity to participate in the making of the decision. In the context of a trial, for example, the participation model would require that the defendant be afforded an opportunity to be present at the trial, to put on evidence, cross examination witnesses, and so forth.

=== Group engagement model ===
Models have also been proposed to understand the psychological basis of justice. One of the more recent of these models is the group engagement model. The group engagement model (GEM), devised by Tom R. Tyler and Steven L. Blader, incorporates past psychological theories to explain the underlying psychological processes of procedural justice. Based on social identity theory and relational models of procedural justice, this model suggests that a group&#x27;s procedural justice process influences members&#x27; identification with the group, which in turn influences their type of engagement within the group.

According to the model, group engagement is seen as either mandatory or discretionary behavior. Mandatory behavior is defined by Tyler and Blader as behavior that is required by the group and thus is motivated by incentives and sanctions. Conversely, discretionary behavior is motivated by internal values and is seen as more cooperative and therefore ideal within a group. Depending on the procedural justice processes of the group, the social identity of the members will be influenced accordingly and different values will be emphasised. The more a member agrees with the type of procedural justice employed, the more they will identify with their group. This increased identification results in the internalization of the group&#x27;s values and attitudes for the group member. This creates a circular relationship as the group&#x27;s procedural justice processes will affect group members&#x27; levels of identification and, as a consequence, this level and type of identification will affect their own values of what is fair and unfair. This, in turn, will then affect how the individuals will engage with their group, with higher identification leading to discretionary and more desirable behavior.

== Due process and natural justice ==

The idea of procedural justice is especially influential in the law. In the United States, for example, a concern for procedural justice is reflected in the Due Process clauses of the United States Constitution. In other common law countries, this same idea is sometimes called natural justice.

Natural justice generally binds &quot;both&quot; public and private entities, while the U.S. concept of due process has a &quot;state action&quot; requirement which means it applies only to state actors. But in the U.S., there are analogous concepts like fair procedure which can bind private parties in their relations with others.

<text>Jal () is a small city located in Lea County, New Mexico, United States. It is New Mexico&#x27;s south-easternmost city, and shares a border with Texas to the east and south. The population was 2,047 at the 2010 census. Jal is historically important in the natural gas industry, from the early 1900s to the present day.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2010, there were 2,047 people, with 788 occupied houses. The population density was . There were 1009 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 84.81% White, 0.83% African American, 0.73% Native American, 11.82% from other races, and 1.66% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 48.12% of the population.

The average household size was 2.60 and the average family size was 3.04.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 29.5% under the age of 19, 12.2% in their 20s, 10.1% in their 30s, 12.6% in their 40s, 13.2% in their 50s, and 22.4% who were 60 years of age or older. The median age was 38.2 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.1 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $39,813, and the median income for a family was $51,538. Males had a median income of $46,250 versus $30,147 for females. The per capita income for the city was $20,597. About 12.0% of families and 14.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 23.6% of those under age 18 and 18.5% of those age 65 or over.

==History==
During the early 1900s, the Cowden boys of Midland, Texas moved the entire John A. Lynch herd to the Monument draw, about 6 miles northeast of present-day Jal. All the cattle were branded with the JAL brand from shoulder to hip. In the process of trying to rebrand the Cowdens, they found it too big a task so they registered the brand under their name in Silver City, New Mexico Territory.

In 1913, Charles Justis (a merchant) applied for a post office under the name &quot;Jal&quot; to open six miles east of the city of Jal. However, in 1916, Jal became drought-stricken and the store and post office were relocated to Muleshoe Wells and the city of Jal was established in its present location.

On November 1, 1927, Texas Co. brought in the first well, the Rhodes #1. Then on June 2, 1928, a second well, serving up more than 90 million cubic feet of gas a day, was brought online 6 miles west of Jal. This created a “boom town,” with all the prosperity and problems that go with it. The Great Depression and low crude prices caused a sharp slump in drilling and people left in droves. Jal almost became a ghost town overnight.

In the summer of 1934, the Cooper #1 brought the “Big Boom” back to Jal. By then Jal had a passenger train and its population rose to around 500. Housing was in short supply and ranchers opened their homes to “roughnecks”. New businesses sprang up, and with the gas gathering system by El Paso Natural Gas, prosperity continued.

==Government==
In 1950, a city hall was built. In 1966, it received a renovation, and in 1987, it received another one. By 2019, the municipal authorities considered the 1950 building out of date, so that year they authorized a renovation of the former Burke Junior High School, with city hall in a eastern portion. This was under construction in 2021.

==Education==
It is within Jal Public Schools.

<doc id="125914" wikidata="Q1045140" url="?curid=125914" title="Carrizozo, New Mexico">
<text>Carrizozo is a town in Lincoln County, New Mexico, United States. It is the county seat, with a population of 996 at the 2010 census. Founded in 1899, the town provided the main railroad access for Lincoln County, and the town experienced significant population growth in the early decades of the 1900s. However, with declining relevance of the railroad, the population of the town has gradually declined. The town is located at the intersection of U.S. Routes 54 and 380.

==Name==
The name of the town is derived from the Spanish vernacular for reed grass (&quot;Carrizo&quot;), which grew significantly in the area and provided excellent feed for ranch cattle. The additional &quot;zo&quot; at the end of the town name was added to indicate abundance of Carrizo grass. The town is now often referred to colloquially as &quot;Zozo&quot;.

==History==
Prior to 1899, the area was primarily a few ranches and a stagecoach crossing with limited permanent settlement. Lawrence Murphy, a merchant active in the Lincoln County War (1878), owned a major ranch in the area. The location of Carrizozo was selected as the site for a station on the El Paso and Northeastern Railway (EP&amp;NE) main line in 1899. Carrizozo was chosen over the nearby booming mine town of White Oaks, resulting in large-scale migration from White Oaks to Carrizozo.

The railroad brought businesses, growing population, and increased importance to the town of Carrizozo. As a result, a county referendum in 1909 moved the seat of Lincoln County from the town of Lincoln to Carrizozo. This decision resulted in a four-year legal battle that was eventually resolved in favor of Carrizozo by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of &quot;Gray v. Taylor&quot;. The result was a boom in which railroad access and political importance combined to lead to significant population growth in Carrizozo. The population reached around 2,000 by 1920.

During this time, Albert B. Fall, a U.S. Senator from New Mexico and later Secretary of the Interior, owned the Three Rivers Ranch just south of Carrizozo, but had to sell it to settle legal debts as a result of his involvement in the Teapot Dome scandal (1922–1923). During the same time, journalist Quentin Reynolds visited the town and wrote a piece on it for &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;. Later, he wrote in &quot;The Wounded Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; that &quot;I used to agree with Bugs that once you left New York, you were strictly on the horse and buggy circuit. But of late years I&#x27;ve had to modify that. Since then I&#x27;ve discovered New Orleans, San Francisco and a little place called Carrizozo, New Mexico, where I want to go when I die. I want to go there and gang around the drug store and sneak behind the prescription counter with Art Rolland and have a nip of what he calls Old Granddaddy then type out his prescriptions for him.&quot;

Carrizozo is about east of the Trinity Site, where the first nuclear bomb was detonated on July 16, 1945. Residents reported tremors like an earthquake and, as the first major downwind settlement, the town received a significant part of the remnants of the mushroom cloud resulting in nuclear fallout of the area, which caused radioactive contamination. Bonito Lake which also lies within the estimated radioactive fallout zone of the 1945 Trinity test, was a water source for Carrizozo.

With the rise of the automobile, Carrizozo&#x27;s proximity to the railroad became less important starting in the 1950s, and the last passenger train passed through in 1968. The result was a decrease in economic opportunity in Carrizozo, and the population fell back to about 1,200 people for much of the end of the 20th century. Recently, the town has seen increasing focus on tourism, and cherry cider produced in the town was known nationally. The Carrizozo Orchard has since been permanently closed.

==Geography==
Carrizozo is located at the northern end of the Tularosa Basin, which extends southward to the New Mexico–Texas border. The town itself is located in a flat area known prior to the founding of the town as the Corrizo flats, with typical Chihuahuan desert scrub and desert grasslands.

To the west of the town is the Carrizozo Malpais, a lava flow that is about 1,500 years old and accessible through the Valley of Fires Recreation Area. To the northeast is Carrizo Mountain, a peak within the Sacramento Mountains, and to the southeast are the Sierra Blanca mountain range.

==Demographics==
As of the 2010 census, there were 996 people living in the town. The racial makeup of the town was 78.71% White, 0.70% African American, 2.61% American Indian, 14.16% Other, and 3.82% identified as two or more. Hispanics of any race were 43.57% of the population. Of the population, 54.72% were men and 45.28% were women. Of these, 15.96% were under the age of 18, 24.50% were over 65, and 59.54% were between 18 and 65.

<doc id="125916" wikidata="Q2380585" url="?curid=125916" title="Ruidoso, New Mexico">
<text>Ruidoso (Spanish for &quot;noisy&quot;) is a village in Lincoln County, New Mexico, United States, adjacent to the Lincoln National Forest. The population was 7,679 at the 2020 census. The city of Ruidoso Downs and the unincorporated area of Alto are suburbs of Ruidoso, and contribute to the Ruidoso Micropolitan Statistical Area&#x27;s population of 21,223.

A mountain resort town, Ruidoso lies in the Sierra Blanca mountain range of south-central New Mexico, where it merges with the Sacramento Mountains to the south. Ruidoso is a resort community close to the slopes of Ski Apache, the Mescalero Apache Tribe-owned ski resort on Sierra Blanca, an almost mountain. The tribe also operates the Inn of the Mountain Gods resort in the area, which includes a casino, hotel, arcade room and golf course. Ruidoso is the largest community in Lincoln County, and serves as the regional economic hub.

In recent years the village is contending with serious questions about the adequacy of the local water supply and zoning enforcement. As in many small communities that have been recently &quot;discovered&quot;, there is an ongoing debate about how best to plan for additional growth.

The village received its name from the Rio Ruidoso (Spanish for &quot;Noisy River&quot;), a small stream that weaves through the city.

==History==

Along the eastern foothills of White Mountain, retired army Captain Paul Dowlin built Dowlin’s Mill where the Carrizo Creek and Rio Ruidoso merge. He had served at nearby Fort Stanton. The Mill was also a general store, dance hall, and moonshine supply.

San Patricio, NM (in the Hondo Valley) was originally known as Ruidoso. In 1875, its name was changed in honor of a Catholic priest’s patron saint. Early Hispanos used the term “Ruidoso” to describe a noisy creek. Today’s Ruidoso grew up around Dowlin’s Mill. Will Dowlin survived his brother, after an employee shot Captain Paul dead.

By 1885, with a general store, blacksmith, post office, cabins along the Rio Ruidoso, and proximity to the Chisholm Trail Ruidoso, NM was born.

The Wingfield family operated a dairy and early post office. By 1914, cabins were being built in Upper Canyon. At Cedar Creek in 1935, a ski area opened on a sloping meadow. 

On July 16, 1945, the Trinity (test) could be felt by local people like an explosion.

By 1947, a race track was opened at Hollywood Park. Visitors played golf in the Gateway area. Finally, in 1963 the Mescalero Apaches purchased the ski area now known as Ski Apache.

===21st century===

In December 2006, seven percent of eligible voters approved a $12.6 million bond issue to finance the expansion and modernization of the local wastewater treatment plant which was built in 1982. In 2011, construction was completed on a $36 million wastewater treatment plant. This state-of-the-art facility utilizes membrane technology to achieve discharge standards within regulatory guidelines. The plant was designed to accommodate future growth. The average daily volume is 1.6 million gallons. The plant can currently process up to 2.7 million gallons per day.

Late at night on July 26, 2008, through July 27, 2008, the town and the river were hit by devastating flash flooding. The remnant circulation of Hurricane Dolly passed over the area and brought as much as of rainfall. Hundreds of tourists, campers and residents were evacuated and the storm caused damage at the Ruidoso Downs Race Track. One person was killed in the flooding, approximately 900 persons required rescue, approximately 500 structures were damaged, and initial damage estimates for Ruidoso were in the range of $15– 20 million.

In March 2016, the village of Ruidoso entered into a Sister City relationship with Puerto Peñasco, Sonora, Mexico.

In April 2022, large parts of Ruidoso were threatened by the McBride Fire; over 200 structures were destroyed and 2 people were killed by the blaze, fueled by intense dryness and strong winds.

&quot;The Christmas Classic&quot; (2023), with Malin Akerman and Ryan Hansen, was filmed at &quot;Ski Apache&quot;, Alto, and Rio Ruidoso.

In June 2024, following the rapid spread of the South Fork Fire and Salt Fire, all 7,000 residents were ordered by officials to evacuate the village. Two people have been confirmed dead. As of July 3, 2024, the fires are at 87% and 84% containment respectively.

Shortly after, the library was moved into a building that was once a school and Old City Hall. The library was only two rooms which the librarian Pat Ward oversaw its maintenance. In 1966, under the director Ruth McGuire Spiegel the library was moved to an old airport terminal and now had the bonus of local and state funding. The first library building was built in 1975 at 501 Sudderth Dr. and the library remained in this location for around twenty years.

The collection consists of books, CDs, DVDs, and an e-branch with access to e-books, audio books and magazines. Some of the programs offered at the Ruidoso Public Library are children’s section, adult game night, teen scene, Ruidoso writers publishing group and a bereavement support group.

<doc id="125918" wikidata="Q2738861" url="?curid=125918" title="White Rock, New Mexico">
<text>White Rock is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Los Alamos County, New Mexico. It is one of two major population centers in the county; the other is Los Alamos (the county seat). The population was 5,725 at the 2010 census. It is largely a bedroom community for employees of Los Alamos National Laboratory and their families. Access to White Rock from the town of Los Alamos and other cities and towns in New Mexico is via New Mexico State Road 4, which forms the northwestern boundary of the community. Administratively, White Rock is a neighborhood of Los Alamos; locals refer to Los Alamos (meaning not White Rock) as &quot;the Townsite,&quot; or &quot;the Hill&quot;.

== History ==
In 1947 the United States Atomic Energy Commission acquired about 100 acres from the United States Forest Service to build a company town to house construction and other contractors’ workers who did not qualify to reside within the secured city of Los Alamos. The town was erected quickly from early 1949, with the intent to provide accommodation for up to 1800 residents by mid-September of that year. This was accomplished with standard building designs, many prefabricated, and included dormitories for 912 men and 32 women, 64 single-, 297 double- and 48 three-bedroom houses, all as rental properties, as well as provision for 217 mobile homes. A school, shopping center, post office and administration building were also included.

By June 1950 the population was estimated 1000 to 1200 persons, including 325 families, but from 1952 steadily dropped with the decline in major construction projects. By 1953, 251 of the prefab dwelling units had been declared surplus and disposed of, and by 1957 only 9 houses and 20 mobile home spaces were rented. The town was officially closed on September 30, and the remaining structures disposed of by the end of that year.

In early 1960 the site was offered as a housing development site to interested developers, for up to 200 houses, with purchase priority being given to people connected to LASL. Work on the second and present White Rock was begun in 1962.

==Geography==

White Rock is located in southeastern Los Alamos County and is bordered to the north and east by Santa Fe; the eastern border follows the Rio Grande through White Rock Canyon. The elevation of the White Rock townsite is , above the river elevation in the canyon. The CDP includes the neighborhood of Pajarito Acres, directly south of and at the same elevation as the White Rock townsite.

The center of the town of Los Alamos is northwest of White Rock, via New Mexico State Roads 4 and 502. A gated entrance to Los Alamos National Laboratory is on Pajarito Road, accessed directly from White Rock.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the White Rock CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.59%, are water.

===White Rock Canyon===

Largely undeveloped White Rock Canyon, on the eastern edge of the community, provides a wilderness recreation area heavily used by residents of White Rock and Santa Fe. The canyon was carved through basalt and tuff by the south-flowing Rio Grande. The canyon runs from the Otowi Suspension Bridge in the north and to Cochiti Dam in the south, with many smaller tributary canyons such Los Alamos, Mortandad, Water, Ancho, Frijoles, and Capulin Canyon. White Rock is situated on a portion of the west side of the canyon along with Bandelier National Monument, a section of Los Alamos National Laboratory, San Ildefonso Pueblo, Cochiti Pueblo, and Santa Fe National Forest. Across the river to the east rises the Caja del Rio.

For a few decades the Chili Line, a narrow gauge railroad, ran on the east bank of the river as far south as the mouth of Diablo Canyon; some day the Rio Grande Trail may occupy the abandoned right of way.

Averaging deep, the canyon provides spectacular vistas, rugged terrain and home to rare plant species as well as endangered animal species. Along the rim of the canyon are many basalt cliffs that are used by rock climbers.

* Hazards: Cliffs, rattlesnakes

==== Blue Dot Trail ====

The trailhead begins about 100 yards southwest of the overlook viewing platform, and is accessible from a small parking lot at the end of the last side road branching east off Overlook Road. Partway to the river a meadow lies on top of a large Toreva block bench (a large piece of terrain which has moved downhill as a unit). At the midway point, the material underfoot changes from dark sharp basaltic rocks to light rounded granitic stones. The trail passes a large spring seeping from scree as the trail nears the Rio Grande. This water and water from the river are not safe to drink.

==== Red Dot Trail ====

This trail, also known as &quot;Pajarito Springs Trail&quot;, is accessible from Piedra Loop in La Senda. Numerous petroglyphs appear along the way, unseen by many hikers concentrating on their footing on this very steep and challenging trail. The rock drawings are varied in style, from Kokopelli to abstract and geometric designs. The local Tewa may have imported some designs from Native Americans of the Great Plains. The &quot;Pajarito Springs&quot; are several in number and combine to form a small creek flowing into a pool via a small waterfall. The trail continues to the Rio Grande.

==White Rock Master Plan==
The commercial center of White Rock has been in decline since approximately 2008, due in part to loss of retail revenues to the Internet and to &quot;big box&quot; stores in nearby communities. Los Alamos County recently began a major effort to revitalize the White Rock commercial center by improving infrastructure and seeking to attract new businesses. Part of the motivation for this effort is the transfer to Los Alamos County of Department of Energy lands just north of State Road 4. The revitalization effort has emphasized community input and is presently being driven by the White Rock Master Plan Implementation Committee, with the support of the County Council.

<doc id="125919" wikidata="Q1112742" url="?curid=125919" title="Columbus, New Mexico">
<text>Columbus is an incorporated village in Luna County, New Mexico, United States, about north of the Mexican border. It is considered a place of historical interest, as the scene of a 1916 attack by Mexican general Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa that caused the United States to send 10,000 troops there in the Mexican Expedition (originally referred to as the &quot;punitive Mexican Expedition&quot;). Columbus&#x27;s population was 1,664 at the 2010 census.

==History==
===Early history (1891–1910s)===
Columbus was established in 1891 just across the Mexican border from Palomas, Chihuahua, and named after 15th-century explorer Christopher Columbus. In 1902, the village was moved north when the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad built its Columbus station. This station is now converted into a museum run by the Columbus Historical Society.

About 1905, it was a very small town with a population of about 100, two of those early settlers being Colonel Andrew O. Bailey and Louis Heller. By this time, Columbus had only one general store, a saloon, and a society inspector. In time, a high school was built, and Perrow G. Mosely established the &quot;Columbus News&quot;, which later was renamed the &quot;Columbus Courier&quot;. By 1915, the town had 700 residents, the Columbus State Bank was built, four hotels were constructed, and several stores and a Baptist church were also established. At that time, the area around Columbus also had rich silver, copper, lead, and zinc deposits.

===1916 Pancho Villa raid===
On March 9, 1916, on the orders of Mexican revolutionary leader Pancho Villa, Colonel Francisco Beltrán, Colonel Candelario Cervantes, General Nicolás Fernández, General Pablo López, and others led 500 men in an attack against the town, which was garrisoned by a detachment of the 13th Cavalry Regiment. Villa&#x27;s army burned a part of the town and killed seven or eight soldiers and 10 residents before retreating back into Mexico.

United States President Woodrow Wilson responded to the Columbus raid by sending 10,000 troops under Brigadier General John J. Pershing to Mexico to pursue Villa. This was known as the Punitive Mexican Expedition or Pancho Villa Expedition. The expedition was eventually called off after failing to find Villa, who had escaped. The Pershing expedition brought prosperity and international attention to Columbus and a realization that war had come to the border of the United States.

===From 1926 to the 1990s===
In 1926 after the Punitive Expedition ended, Columbus started to change and decay over the decades. Camp Furlong activity was greatly reduced. The army decided to close their camp, and the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad stopped service in Columbus. After all these events, the economy naturally faded over time. 

In the 1990s, Columbus started to revitalize, with the development of city and state parks, museums, RV parks, and history involving the city.

===2011 gun-smuggling scandal===
In July 2011, Columbus dissolved its police force after a gun-smuggling scandal that involved its village officials and others. The mayor, a village trustee, a former police chief, and nine other people were indicted in the scandal. The case was prosecuted by the United States Attorney from El Paso, Texas, before United States District Court Judge Robert Brack in Las Cruces, New Mexico. Of the 11 people charged, 10 pleaded guilty, with one person still at large. Sentences ranged from five years in federal prison to two years&#x27; probation.

==Geography==

About 90% of the students come from homes where Spanish is the dominant language. The staff at Columbus Elementary is required to be bilingually endorsed or working toward bilingual endorsement. The mission of Columbus Elementary School is to build on the students&#x27; bicultural and bilingual environment; they work in partnership with the parents and the community to enable students to reach their full potential.

Students from Columbus and Puerto Palomas attend Columbus Elementary from preschool up to fifth grade. Students then move on to attend Deming Intermediate School (6) in Deming, Red Mountain Middle School (7–8), and Deming High School (9–12).

Deming Public Schools buses U.S. citizen students residing in Mexico (including the city of Palomas) from the United States-Mexico border to Columbus Elementary and to upper grades in Deming.

==In popular culture==
Pancho Villa&#x27;s raid on Columbus is depicted in the novel &quot;The Friends of Pancho Villa&quot; (1996) by James Carlos Blake. In &quot;Spring Break Adventure&quot;, the sixth film in The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones series, Indiana Jones and his cousin are in town during Pancho Villa&#x27;s raid, and he ends up joining Pancho Villa&#x27;s army.

Columbus features in the 2008 film &quot;The Shepherd: Border Patrol&quot; starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. The 1989 cult classic &quot;Sonny Boy&quot; has Columbus-based locations.

<doc id="125925" wikidata="Q2381943" url="?curid=125925" title="Church Rock, New Mexico">
<text>Church Rock () is a census-designated place (CDP) in McKinley County, New Mexico, United States. The population was 1,542 at the 2020 census, up from 1,128 in 2010. The community is named for Church Rock, a prominent natural landmark.

==Geography==

The community is located in western McKinley County at (35.534961, -108.611593). It is bordered to the west by Gallup, the county seat, to the southwest by Sundance, and to the east by Iyanbito.

New Mexico State Road 566 has its southern terminus in Church Rock and runs north through the center of the community and leads northeast to its terminus. U.S. Route 66 runs along the southern edge of the community, leading west into Gallup and east the same distance to Exit 36 on Interstate 40.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Church Rock CDP has a total area of , all of it recorded as land. The South Fork of the Puerco River runs through the community, leading west to the Little Colorado River in Arizona.

==Uranium mining==

On July 16, 1979, the dam at a United Nuclear Corporation (based in Virginia) Church Rock uranium mill was breached and spilled 1,100 tons of milled uranium ore and of heavy metal effluent into the Puerco River. This was the largest release of radioactive waste in U.S. history, but until recently, no epidemiological studies were undertaken on the effects on the population. With the declining uranium market, two of the mines closed in 1983 and the third closed in February 1986.

In 2003 the Church Rock Uranium Monitoring Project was initiated by the Churchrock Chapter of the
Navajo Nation to assess environmental impacts of abandoned uranium mines and build capacity to conduct community-based research with policy implications. Its May 2007 report found that significant radiation from both natural and mining sources remains in the area. The community is dedicated to remedy the problem as much as possible.

In 2005 the Navajo Nation prohibited any further uranium mining in the nation. In 2008 the US EPA and the Navajo EPA began a five-year plan to identify and ameliorate areas contaminated by uranium mining; their priority has been water sources and structures.

In 2013 the Churchrock Chapter passed a resolution supporting a demonstration in-situ mining at Section 8 and 17. The resolution passed with 68 in support 26 opposed and 16 abstained. A minority of community members continue to oppose mining operations, as do some outside residents who reside in other chapters and non-Navajos.

<doc id="125927" wikidata="Q577981" url="?curid=125927" title="Gallup, New Mexico">
<text>Gallup is a city in McKinley County, New Mexico, United States, with a population of 21,899 as of the 2020 census. A substantial percentage of its population is Native American, with residents from the Navajo, Hopi, and Zuni tribes. Gallup is the county seat of McKinley County and the most populous city between Flagstaff and Albuquerque, along historic U.S. Route 66.

Gallup is known as the &quot;Heart of Indian Country&quot; because it is on the edge of the Navajo reservation and is home to members of many other tribes, as well.

The city is on the Trails of the Ancients Byway, one of the designated New Mexico Scenic Byways. 

Because of the nearby rugged terrain, it was a popular location in the 1940s and 1950s for Hollywood Westerns.

==History==
Gallup was founded in 1881 as a railhead for the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. The city was named after David Gallup, a paymaster for the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad.
There is widespread belief that during World War II, the city fought successfully to prevent 800 Japanese American residents from being placed in wartime internment, 
the only New Mexico city to do so. But this is not true. Executive Order 9066 was never used to intern people living in Gallup, and the city complied with all federal orders and policies during the war.

On August 4, 2022, an SUV, driven by an intoxicated individual, drove through a parade crowd during the city&#x27;s 100th annual Intertribal Celebration, leaving 15 injured, including two police officers and several children.

==Geography==
Gallup is in western McKinley County, east of the Arizona border. Interstate 40 passes through the north side of the city, with access from Exits 16, 20, and 22. The highway leads east to Albuquerque and west to Holbrook, Arizona. Historic U.S. Route 66 passes through the center of town. U.S. Route 491 has its southern terminus at I-40 in Gallup and leads north to Shiprock and then into Colorado.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are water. The city is in the valley of the Puerco River, which runs southwest to join the Little Colorado River in Holbrook.

=== Climate ===
Gallup, like most of the interior Mountain West, has a cool semiarid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;). The summers are hot during the day, but the high altitude and low humidity mean that nights remain distinctly cool; as late as July 2, 1997, the temperature fell to . Despite the large diurnal temperature range, most rain falls in the summer from afternoon thunderstorms. Snow is common and sometimes heavy; the maximum in a month is in December 1992 and the most in a year between July 1990 and June 1991. Actual snow &quot;cover&quot;, with the hot sun at Gallup&#x27;s altitude, however, has never exceeded , and for no day averages over .

== Demographics ==
As of the 2000 census, 20,209 people, 6,810 households, and 4,869 families were residing in the city. The population density was . There were 7,349 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 43.8% Native American, 35.2% White, 2.0% Asian, 1.2% African American, 12.1% from other races, and 5.8% from two or more races. About 31.7% of the population was Hispanic or Latino of any race.

Of the 6,810 households, 41.1% had children under 18 living with them, 45.3% were married couples living together, 19.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.5% were not families. About 23.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.8% had someone living alone who was 65 or older. The average household size was 2.85, and the average family size was 3.39.

In the city, the age distribution was 32.7% under 18, 9.3% from 18 to 24, 28.8% from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 8.9% who were 65 or older. The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.0 males. For every 100 females 18 and over, there were 86.2 males.

It has close proximity to Native American reservations, and historic lack of economic development in addition to many mine closures in the last century. As a result of these closures, a large proportion of Gallup&#x27;s households is low-income. The median income for a household in the city was $34,868, and the median income for a family was $39,197. Males had a median income of $33,380 versus $24,441 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,789. About 16.6% of families and 20.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 26.8% of those under age 18 and 16.8% of those age 65 or over.

Gallup has a significant Palestinian-American population, unusual for a city its size.

===Crime===
Crime is a serious problem in Gallup. In 2012, violent crime was nearly five times the national average. As a result, the city has the highest violent crime rate in New Mexico. According to an article published in November 2014, &quot;Gallup saw 463 violent crimes last year including murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. That’s an 11% increase from the year before and two times the rate of Albuquerque, the state’s largest city.&quot;

==Arts and culture ==


U.S. Route 66 passed through Gallup, and the town&#x27;s name is mentioned in the lyrics of the song &quot;(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;ll see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico&quot;). In 2003, the U.S. and New Mexico Departments of Transportation renumbered US Highway 666, the city&#x27;s other major highway, as Route 491. Former Governor Bill Richardson pushed for (and got) the number changed because &quot;666&quot; is associated with Satan and Devil worship, thus it was considered &quot;cursed&quot; or a &quot;Beast&quot; to some locals. The situation was exacerbated by the high death toll on the highway, which was largely a result of high rates of drivers under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and budget shortfalls among both the New Mexico Department of Transportation and state and local law-enforcement agencies.

Gallup has a modestly lively nighttime culture downtown, Indian dances during summertime nights, art crawls, and small museums, including a Navajo code talk museum.
Gallup commissioned a number of murals highlighting local culture, and contributions dot downtown.

Being the largest city between Flagstaff and Albuquerque, Gallup claims many notable buildings, places, events, and people.
The historic El Rancho Hotel &amp; Motel has hosted a numerous array of movie stars, including John Wayne, Ronald Reagan, Humphrey Bogart, Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn, Joan Crawford, Kirk Douglas, Doris Day, Gregory Peck, and Burt Lancaster. The rugged terrain surrounding Gallup was popular with Hollywood filmmakers during the 1940s and &#x27;50s for the on-location shooting of Westerns. Actors and film crews would stay at that hotel during filming. Films made in Gallup include &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; (1930), &quot;Pursued&quot; (1947), &quot;The Sea of Grass&quot; (1947), &quot;Four Faces West&quot; (1948), &quot;Only the Valiant&quot; (1951), &quot;Ace in the Hole&quot; (1951), &quot;Escape from Fort Bravo&quot; (1953), &quot;A Distant Trumpet&quot; (1964), and &quot;The Hallelujah Trail&quot; (1965). Other movies shot here are &quot;Redskin&quot; (1928), and &quot;Superman&quot; (1978).

Gallup is sometimes called the &quot;Indian Capital of the World&quot;, for its location in the heart of Native American lands, and the presence of Navajo, Zuni, Hopi, and other tribes. Well over a third of the city&#x27;s population has Native American roots. Gallup&#x27;s nickname references the huge impact of the Native American cultures found in and around the city.

==Education==
Gallup-McKinley County Public Schools is the local school district.

Previously, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) operated Manuelito Hall in Gallup, a dormitory that housed Native American students attending Gallup-McKinley schools. In 1973, it had about 300 students. That year, the BIA closed Manuelito Hall, planning to move students to various boarding schools.

<text>Ramah ( – &quot;place of wild onions&quot;) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in McKinley County, New Mexico. The population was 461 as of the 2020 United States census.

==History==
Established in 1876, Ramah was one of fifty locations in the New Mexico Territory settled, under the direction of Brigham Young, by Mormon pioneers, and is one of only three that remain today. Ramah was originally settled for the purpose of missionary work to be carried out within the Zuni and Navajo communities. Many of the original stone houses are still standing and are a testament to the hard work and skill of Ramah&#x27;s early founders. One such building has been restored and preserved as a museum to display the heritage of the valley&#x27;s past.

Ramah Lake was built by these same pioneers in order to farm the surrounding area, which receives moderate rainfall on a yearly basis. The lake relies on snowfall and spring runoff to sustain its water levels. This trait is shared by many areas in the state of New Mexico. In recent years, due to drought, the lake has dried up; the town irrigation committee used this low water level to make improvements including dredging a large amount of silt buildup and reinforcing the dam, allowing water to be used more efficiently. Modernization in irrigation has allowed water to be used more effectively.

==Geography==
Ramah is in southwestern McKinley County and is bordered to the east by Cibola County. New Mexico State Road 53 passes through Ramah, leading to El Morro National Monument and west to Zuni Pueblo. Gallup, the McKinley county seat, is northwest of Ramah by road.

Lying at above sea level, Ramah is considered by some as a high desert, but at higher elevations it includes tall pines, sandstone cliffs, and timber-covered mountains. Much of the lower landscape in the surrounding area is covered with lava flows from the chain of volcanos to the south.

Ramah lies between the Zuni Indian Reservation to the west, the Ramah Navajo Indian Reservation, and the Cibola National Forest to the north.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Ramah CDP has a total area of , all land. The town center lies in the valley of Cebolla Creek, a west-flowing tributary of the Rio Pescado, part of the Zuni River watershed leading southwest to the Little Colorado River in Arizona. Ramah Reservoir, built on Cebolla Creek, sits just outside the community to the north.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 407 people, 121 households, and 98 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 175 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 64.86% White, 25.80% Native American, 0.98% Pacific Islander, 0.74% from other races, and 7.62% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.63% of the population.

There were 121 households, out of which 50.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.9% were married couples living together, 10.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 18.2% were non-families. 17.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.36 and the average family size was 3.81.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 37.6% under the age of 18, 8.8% from 18 to 24, 24.6% from 25 to 44, 18.4% from 45 to 64, and 10.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 28 years. For every 100 females, there were 115.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.9 males.

The per capita income for the CDP was $10,419. About 23.0% of families and 31.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 46.8% of those under age 18 and 11.9% of those age 65 or over.

==Religion==
In 1968 the community was mostly made up of Mormons.

==Education==
Gallup-McKinley County Schools, the local school district, operates Ramah Elementary School and Ramah Middle/High School in Ramah. Due to an agreement between McKinley County and Cibola County, residents of the Ramah Navajo Indian Reservation are bussed to these schools even though they are physically in Cibola County due to the long distance of the nearest Cibola County schools away from the reservation.

In 1954, a dormitory opened at Ramah Schools, which allowed the majority of residents of the Ramah Navajo Indian Reservation to attend public schools close to their residences. The Ramah Village public high school closed in 1968, due to being condemned. The district also stated that the enrollment was too low. Area secondary students were reassigned to Zuni High School, then in the Gallup-McKinley district. Accordingly the dormitory became restricted only to elementary school students. Ramah Navajo High School opened in the former Ramah High School in 1970; in 1975 it moved to Pinehill, where it became Pine Hill Schools. In 1983 the Ramah Village public high school reopened. In 1995 the combined enrollment of this school and the elementary school in Ramah was fewer than 400.

==Religion==
The majority-Native American population is primarily Navajo. Many practice the Navajo traditional beliefs: medicine men and Native American Church; in addition, some are also members of several Christian congregations, such as the Saint Bonaventure Catholic mission, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and several Protestant denominations including Baptists, Church of Christ, Church of God, and some independent evangelical congregations.

=== Gallup-McKinley County Schools ===
The three local public schools in Tohatchi are operated by Gallup McKinley County Schools. They include Tohatchi Elementary School, Tohatchi Middle School, and Tohatchi High School. The public schools are located west of Highway 491.

The Tohatchi mascot for the Gallup-McKinley County Schools is a cougar, with the school colors being maroon and gold. The Tohatchi High School Lady Cougars notably won the 2017 New Mexico high school girls 3-A basketball championship.

Before Tohatchi High School was built in the 1980s, the mascot had previously been a bobcat, but the mascot was changed to a cougar sometime in the 1970s. The school colors were different, as well.

=== BIE/BIA schools ===

Formerly Chuska Boarding School, Ch&#x27;ooshgai Community School is a grant school boarding facility of the Bureau of Indian Education that offers kindergarten through eighth grade.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs previously had a bureau-operated boarding school, Tohatchi Boarding School, but it was shut down after the addition of public schools to Tohatchi. Cindy Yurth of the &quot;Navajo Times&quot; described it as one of the first such schools on the Navajo Indian Reservation. Its students included children from Tuba City, Arizona. According to Tohatchi Chapter President Edwin Begay, his father told him that the townsite was formerly an area maintained by the school to have swine. In 1979, the school had Navajo-language classes and one of the few Navajo school principals on the Navajo Nation at the time, Phillip Belone.

=== Private school ===
A private, non-profit facility for students with special needs began in 1976 at Chuska Boarding School. The program aimed to provide opportunities for engaging in life skills, academics, and vocational education, as an effort to develop and maintain special education services for the local indigenous community. Called &quot;A School for Me, Inc.&quot;, it served 76 students in 1977 and only 58 in 1982.

== Local tribal government ==
Tohatchi has a chapter house, a local administrative office that governs a part of the Fort Defiance Agency of the Navajo Nation. It was built in 1952 and renovated in 1989.

== Notable people ==
* Jennifer Nez Denetdale, educator
* Juanita, Navajo weaver, wife of Chief Manuelito
* Chief Manuelito, Navajo tribal leader
* Cassandra Manuelito-Kerkvliet, Navajo academic administrator
* Shannon Pinto, politician

==In film==
The 1965 film &quot;The Hallelujah Trail&quot;, directed by John Sturges and starring Burt Lancaster, was shot in nearby locations with the Chuska Mountains serving as a backdrop to some of the movie&#x27;s most iconic scenes.

<text>Tones on Tail were a British post-punk band formed in 1982, originally as a musical side project of Daniel Ash of the gothic rock group Bauhaus. Their music was described by one critic as &quot;doom-and-dance-pop.&quot;

==History==
While still a member of Bauhaus, Ash formed Tones on Tail early in 1982, originally as a duo with Glenn Campling, an art school friend and flatmate who had also been a roadie for Bauhaus. The band&#x27;s name was a reference to the way calibration tones were recorded on the &quot;tail&quot; of reel-to-reel tape.

The pair issued their debut eponymous EP on 4AD in March 1982, followed by the single &quot;There&#x27;s Only One!&quot;, released by Beggars Banquet Records on 24 September. Ash sang and played guitar, Campling played bass, and both played percussion and keyboards. After the break-up of Bauhaus in 1983, Ash and Campling were joined by Bauhaus&#x27;s drummer Kevin Haskins and the band became a full-time concern for all three members. Their first release as a trio was the &quot;Burning Skies&quot; EP, issued by Situation Two on 6 May 1983.

Their sole studio album, &quot;Pop&quot;, was released by Beggars Banquet on 6 April 1984 in the UK, featuring the singles &quot;Performance&quot; (released 9 March) and &quot;Lions&quot; (released 11 May). The album was also issued in North America in altered form as &quot;The Album Pop&quot;. &quot;Go!&quot;, the popular B-side of &quot;Lions&quot;, was issued on its own as a single in Canada, licensed by Vertigo Records. Throughout October of that year, the group embarked on a short 12-date tour of the US; in concert, the band sported all white outfits. The final Tones on Tail single, &quot;Christian Says&quot;, was issued on 9 November. They disbanded later that year, and Ash and Haskins quickly formed Love and Rockets with former Bauhaus bassist David J.

The 1998 compilation &quot;Everything!&quot; compiled every Tones on Tail track in remastered form, plus a radio interview with Ash and Haskins.

In 2017, Ash and Haskins, along with Haskins&#x27; daughter Diva Dompé on bass, formed the band Poptone, performing songs by Bauhaus, Love and Rockets and Tones on Tail in concert. On 11 May 2024, Tones on Tail performed their first official set since 1984 at the Cruel World Festival, with Dompé filling in for Campling.

==Reception==
Richard Williams of &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot; said, &quot;Tones on Tail carries on with the traditional Bauhaus taste for the macabre, but charts new courses of twisting the pop thing.&quot; James Muretich of &quot;The Calgary Herald&quot; wrote, &quot;From the ashes of Bauhaus has arisen a British trio that is turning into one of the most impressive and macabre dance bands around.&quot; Writing retrospectively for AllMusic, critic Ned Raggett said, &quot;With their former band&#x27;s generally gloomier shadows left behind, what Ash and Haskins draw from their time with Bauhaus is that group&#x27;s melange of styles—their most underappreciated strength&quot;.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Alamogordo was an unofficial center for research on pilot safety and the developing United States&#x27; space program.

Alamogordo is a charter city with a council-manager form of government. City government provides a large number of recreational and leisure facilities for its citizens, including a large park in the center of the city, many smaller parks scattered through the city, a golf course, Alameda Park Zoo, a network of walking paths, Alamogordo Public Library, and a senior citizens&#x27; center. Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center is a nonprofit shared military/civilian facility that is also the hospital for Holloman Air Force Base.

== History ==
Tularosa Basin has been inhabited for at least 11,000 years. There are signs of previous inhabitants in the area such as the Clovis culture, the Folsom culture, the peoples of the Archaic period, and the Formative stage. The Mescalero Apache were already living in the Tularosa Basin when the Spanish came in 1534, and Mescalero oral history says they have always lived there. In 1719, the Spanish built a chapel at La Luz (about from the future site of Alamogordo), although La Luz was not settled until about 1860.

The city of Alamogordo was founded in June 1898, when the El Paso and Northeastern Railroad, headed by Charles Bishop Eddy, extended the railway to the town. Eddy influenced the design of the community, which included large, wide thoroughfares and tree-lined irrigation canals. Charles Eddy&#x27;s brother, John Arthur Eddy, named the new city. He created a neologism adapted from the Spanish words for &quot;large/fat cottonwood&quot; after a grove of stout cottonwoods he remembered from the Pecos River area. However, the word &quot;Almagordo&quot; was not used in the Spanish language. When Alamogordo was laid out in 1898, the east–west streets were given numerical designations, while north–south streets were named after states. The present-day White Sands Boulevard was then called Pennsylvania Avenue.

With the creation of White Sands National Monument in 1934, tourism began.

The Works Progress Administration, a government program created in 1935 in response to the Great Depression, was responsible for the construction of several government buildings in Alamogordo. These include the Otero County Administration Building at 1101 New York Avenue, a Pueblo style building originally constructed as the main U.S. Post Office in 1938. The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The main entrance portico features frescoes by Peter Hurd, which were completed in 1942. 

In July 1941, the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range was established. 

The Post Office moved out in 1961, and the building was used by a succession of Federal agencies and was known as the Federal Building. The last Federal agency to occupy it was the United States Forest Service who used it as the headquarters of the Lincoln National Forest until October 2008, when that agency moved to a newly constructed building. In February 2009, ownership of the building was transferred to Otero County government and many government offices were moved from the Courthouse to its new Administration Building .

In 1983, Atari, Inc. buried more than 700,000 unsold Atari 2600 video game cartridges in Alamogordo&#x27;s landfill. Most notably, Atari discarded many copies of the unpopular &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. This event was often believed to be an urban legend, until it was confirmed by Atari and excavations at the landfill.

Alamogordo briefly made international news in late 2001 when Christ Community Church held a public book burning of books in the Harry Potter series, and several other series, on December 30.

== Geography ==
As of 2010, Alamogordo had a total area of , all land. The city is located on the western flank of the Sacramento Mountains and on the eastern edge of the Tularosa Basin. It lies within the Rio Grande rift and in the northernmost part of the Chihuahuan Desert. Tectonic activity is low in the Tularosa Basin. Plants native to the area are typical of the southern New Mexico foothills and include creosote bush, mesquite, saltbush, cottonwood, desert willow, and many species of cactus and yucca.

The Tularosa Basin is an endorheic, or closed, basin; that is, no water flows out of it. Because of this and because of the geology of the region, water in the basin is hard: it has very high total dissolved solids concentrations, in excess of 3,000 mg/L. The Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility, a Bureau of Reclamation laboratory doing research and development on desalination of brackish water, is located in Alamogordo. The gypsum crystals of White Sands National Park are formed in Lake Lucero. Water drains from the mountains carrying dissolved gypsum and collects in Lake Lucero. After the water dries, the winds pick up the gypsum crystals and distribute them over the basin.

===Climate===
Alamogordo has a semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;), bordering a desert climate (&quot;BWk&quot;), with hot summers and mild winters. Rainfall is low and usually confined to the monsoon from July to September, when half a typical year&#x27;s rainfall of will occur – although December 1991 did see . The wettest calendar year has been 1941 with and the driest 1952 with , while the wettest month on record has been September 1941 when fell. September 1941 also saw the largest daily rainfall at Alamogordo with falling on the 22nd of that month.

Temperatures outside of monsoonal storms are very hot during the summer: 89.1 days exceed and temperatures as high as occurred on June 22, 1981, and July 8, 1951. During the winter, days are very mild and sunny, but nights are cold, with reached on 55.1 mornings during an average winter, although only ten mornings have ever fallen to or below , with the coldest temperature recorded at Alamogordo being during a major cold wave on February 3, 2011. Snow is very rare, with a mean of no more than and a median very close to zero. The most snowfall in one month was in December 1960.

===German community, 1992–2019===
Previously Alamogordo had a German community due to the presence of the German Air Force at Holloman Air Force Base; in 1992 that air force made Holloman its main pilot training center in the United States. Holloman was chosen due to its weather conditions. There was a subdivision called &quot;Little Germany&quot; with houses that had German-style electrical outlets. The Deutsche Schule Alamogordo educated German children, as did the local schools. Additionally area supermarkets had German cuisine.

By 1999, there were about 1,110 German dependents and 900 German military personnel in Alamogordo. By 2003 there were about 2,000 Germans in Alamogordo. That year there were tensions between Americans and Germans since Germany chose not to join the U.S. in the Iraq War.

In 2019, the German military withdrew from the base.

Until the German Air Force left, Oktoberfest was celebrated annually in late September, hosted by the German Air Force at Holloman Air Force Base. The public was invited, and shuttle buses ran between Alamogordo and the base.

== Economy ==
Alamogordo is the economic center of Otero County, with nearly half the Otero County population living within the city limits. Alamogordo today has very little manufacturing and has a primarily service and retail economy, driven by tourism, a large nearby military installation and a concentration of military retirees. In 2006 the per capita income in Otero County was $22,377 versus per capita income in New Mexico of $29,346.

=== Economic history ===

Alamogordo was founded as a company town to support the building of the El Paso and Northeastern Railroad, a portion of the transcontinental railway that was being constructed in the late 19th century. Initially its main industry was timbering for railroad ties. The railroad founders were also eager to found a major town that would persist after the railroad was completed; they formed the Alamogordo Improvement Company to develop the area, making Alamogordo an early example of a planned community. The Alamogordo Improvement Company owned all the land, platted the streets, built the first houses and commercial buildings, donated land for a college, and placed a restrictive covenant on each deed prohibiting the manufacture, distribution, or sale of intoxicating liquor.

Tourism became an important part of the local economy from the creation of White Sands National Monument in 1934. Construction began on the Alamogordo Army Air Field (the present-day Holloman Air Force Base) in 1942, and the Federal government has been a strong presence in Alamogordo ever since. Education has also been an important part of the local economy. In addition to the local school system, Alamogordo is home to the New Mexico School for the Blind and Visually Impaired, founded in 1903, and a branch of New Mexico State University founded in 1958. The largest non-government employer in the city is the Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center with 650 employees in 2008.

=== Military impact ===
Holloman Air Force Base, located approximately west of the city limits, is the largest employer of Alamogordo residents, and has a major effect on the local economy. According to some estimates, Holloman accounts for half of the Alamogordo economy. According to the 49th Fighter Wing Public Affairs office, as of January 2008 Holloman directly employs 6,111 personnel with a gross payroll of $266 million. It indirectly creates another 2,047 jobs with a payroll of $77 million. The estimated amount spent in the community, including payroll, construction projects, supplies, services, health care, and education, is $482 million.

An estimated 6,700 military retirees live in the area. Counting both USAF and German Air Force personnel there are 1,383 active military and 1,641 military dependents living on base and 2,765 active military and 2,942 military dependents living off base. After 27 years of training at Holloman, the German Air Force left in 2019. They relocated their pilot training to Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas.

Future Combat Systems is a wide-ranging modernization project of the US Army. Much of the work will be done at Fort Bliss, with some at White Sands Missile Range and some at Holloman Air Force Base. Alamogordo is expected to get some economic benefit due to its proximity to these three bases.

===Economic development===
Otero County Economic Development Council is a nonprofit organization founded in 1984. Its focus has generally been on job creation and recruiting and expanding businesses in Otero County, including helping them satisfy business regulations in New Mexico and lining up funding. Its role expanded in 2000, when Alamogordo passed an Economic Development Gross Receipts Tax. OCEDC continues to work to attract businesses, but now it also helps develop the incentive packages that will be paid by the new tax, and a portion of the tax receipts go to fund OCEDC&#x27;s operating expenses. Formal economic development plans have been adopted by Alamogordo and by Otero County.

OCEDC has recruited several new employers by using financial incentives. A 1-800-Flowers call center opened in November 2001 and received $1.25 million in city rent abatements, a 50% reduction in property taxes from Otero County, and $940,000 in plant training funds from the State of New Mexico.
A Sunbaked Biscuits cookie factory opened in 2006 and received $800,000 in job-training incentives from the state.
When the company went out of business in 2007, Marietta Baking took over the cookie factory and received interest-free loans, job-training incentives, and partial forgiveness of indebtedness for job creation.
A branch office of PreCheck Inc., a company performing background checks of health-care workers, opened in 2006. PreCheck received $2.4 million in high-wage job creation tax credits, $1.5 million in job-training subsidies, $1.5 million in capital outlay money for roads and infrastructure, a $625,000 allocation from City of Alamogordo for upgrading sewer lines in the area, and 20.8 acres of land from Heritage Group, a developer.

<text>Cloudcroft is a village in Otero County, New Mexico, United States, and is located within the Lincoln National Forest. The population was 750 at the 2020 census.

Its high elevation of allows for a mild summer, and the forested mountains make it a tourist attraction for the surrounding deserts. Tourism is the primary economy of the village.

==History==

In the 1890s, the El Paso and Northeastern Railroad, organized by brothers Charles Bishop Eddy and John Arthur Eddy, arrived in the newly founded town of Alamogordo intending to continue the rail line north to the mining town of White Oaks and beyond. This required a steady supply of timber. In 1898 the Eddy brothers sent a survey crew into the Sacramento Mountains to determine the feasibility of extending a line up the summit to harvest the forests. The crew reported that not only was it possible, but the area could attract visitors. The name of &quot;Cloudcroft&quot; – a pasture for the clouds – was suggested and work on the line soon began.

By the end of the year, the rail line had been extended as far as Toboggan Canyon, and construction was started on a pavilion at the summit to provide accommodations for the anticipated tourists. It consisted of a dining room, kitchen, parlor, entertainment hall, and 40 tents set on wooden platforms. In May 1899 the railroad reached Cox Canyon and in June 1899, &quot;The Pavilion&quot; was formally opened by John Eddy. The first visitors rode the train as far as Toboggan and finished the journey by stagecoach. Favorable reports in newspapers quickly made Cloudcroft a popular destination. An additional resort, The Lodge, was built as a more upscale alternative to The Pavilion. The rail line arrived in Cloudcroft in early 1900, and in June 1900 the train depot was finished, located just west of The Pavilion. Meeting the trains became a daily activity in the village, with three arriving each day, bringing lumber, mail, and passengers.

In 1909, The Lodge burned down; it was rebuilt at its present location in 1911. The Pavilion also burned twice in the 1920s, but was rebuilt each time to conform to the original plans. The Lodge at Cloudcroft hosted numerous notable guests, and in the 1930s, was managed by Conrad Hilton.

As automobiles grew in popularity, the rail line began to lose money. Passenger service ended in 1938, and the last freight train ran in 1947. The extant Mexican Canyon Trestle of the now defunct rail line is located near Cloudcroft.

In 2010, fire destroyed two downtown buildings and caused smoke damage to other businesses in downtown Cloudcroft.

<doc id="125948" wikidata="Q3301868" url="?curid=125948" title="La Luz, New Mexico">
<text>La Luz is a census-designated place (CDP) in Otero County, New Mexico, United States. The population was 1,615 at the 2000 census. It is located immediately north of Alamogordo and lies in the eastern edge of the Tularosa Basin and on the western flank of the Sacramento Mountains. Until 1848, La Luz was a part of Mexico. The CDP gets its name from the Spanish word for &quot;light&quot;.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

La Luz sits at the opening of La Luz Canyon Creek, whose headwaters are high in the Sacramento Mountains. The waters of La Luz and Fresnal creeks are used by both the much larger city of Alamogordo, just to the south of La Luz and by La Luz in a ditch or acequia system. The City of Alamogordo has constructed a large reservoir to the south of La Luz to impound these waters.

==History==

Native Americans lived in the area for thousands of years prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the late 16th Century. The Mescalero Apache homelands covered an area of south-central New Mexico including the Sacramento Mountains and the Tularosa Basin. Today, the ancestral homelands of the Apache have been reduced to those lands contained in the Mescalero Apache Reservation, approximately 30 miles northeast of La Luz. There is some dispute over the founding of La Luz. By some accounts, it was founded by Franciscan friars as early as the 18th Century and called Nuestra Señora De La Luz (Our Lady of the Light). Early maps of the area include this notation and La Luz Canyon may have served as an early pass over the Sacramento Mountains connecting with the Peñasco river, which eventually flows into the Pecos River near present-day Artesia, New Mexico. The Sacramento Mountains reach a height of 9,000 feet.

It is well documented that a large group of Hispanic settlers came to the area around 1864 leaving villages along the Rio Grande in the vicinity of present-day Socorro, New Mexico, after devastating floods had occurred. These settlers founded the Village of Tularosa along the banks of Tularosa Creek and established a large acequia system and agricultural area.

Anglo settlers arrived in increasing numbers in the area especially after the Civil War with some establishing large ranches in the Tularosa Basin and nearby areas to supply beef to nearby Fort Stanton. Increasing rivalries between various competing factions would result in the Lincoln County War. The arrival of the railroad in the area brought rapid change to the area. The railroad reached El Paso, ninety miles to the south, in 1882. Charles B. Eddy and partners constructed a branch line from El Paso northward to exploit the timber resources of the Sacramento Mountains and coal deposits further north near present-day White Oaks, New Mexico. The establishment of the railroad resulted in the founding of Alamogordo in 1898 just a few miles south of La Luz. Eddy then constructed a branch into the Sacramento Mountains that went through La Luz and climbed to approximately 9,000 feet within the span of a few miles. Often referred to as the &quot;Cloud Climbing Railroad&quot; it was an engineering marvel. The mountain section of the railroad was dismantled in the early 1940s. The Village of Cloudcroft was established in the Sacramento Mountains and offered residents of El Paso an escape from the heat during the summer. Eddy&#x27;s partner and lawyer for the railroad, William Ashton Hawkins, established a farm and large home which still stands in La Luz.

In the early Twentieth Century, Rowland Hazard III (1882–1945), the heir of an industrial fortune from Rhode Island, came to the area and established a large ranch and farm in the canyon areas above La Luz. He had the Coronado Lodge constructed as a hunting lodge in Cottonwood Canyon out of native stone in the early 1920s. Hazzard also established the La Luz Pottery Works after discovery of rich clay deposits in La Luz Canyon. The pottery works were well known for the manufacture of clay roof tiles and other architectural components such as chimney pots as well as extremely large pottery vessels. The pottery works supplied contractors nationwide at a time when the Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style was at its height. Both the Coronado Lodge and the pottery works remain as fine examples of this type of architecture.

==Economy==

The largest employer in the surrounding area is Holloman Air Force Base. La Luz itself is largely residential and agricultural in land use but a small market is located on the state maintained road that connects the village to Highway 70. La Luz has long been known for the many fruits that are grown in the area including figs, apricots, plums and peaches. Apples, cherries, and pears are grown in the higher elevations in the canyon areas to the east of the village. The surrounding area also has a number of vineyards and pistachio groves. A number of artists also reside in the area.

<doc id="125950" wikidata="Q2344600" url="?curid=125950" title="Timberon, New Mexico">
<text>Timberon is a census-designated place (CDP) in Otero County, New Mexico, United States, and is within the Sacramento Mountains at the southern edge of the Lincoln National Forest. The population was 345 at the 2020 census.

Timberon has a nine-hole golf course, as well as a lodge, a pool, a church, an airstrip and a volunteer fire department. The residents consider it a retirement and resort community. Children are bussed into Cloudcroft for public school.

==Geography==
Timberon is located in a forested valley, known as Sacramento Canyon, on the southern slopes of the Sacramento Mountains. The Sacramento Creek, an intermittent creek, flows southeast through the valley. The community extends up several crosscutting canyons including Arkansas Canyon, Graveyard Canyon and Carrisa Canyon. The elevation in Timberon varies from 6,900 to 7,200 feet. Jefferies Peak at is located directly to the east of the valley, and Culp Peak at lies to the west.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

==History==
The land that now constitutes the community of Timberon was purchased from the State of New Mexico in 1933 by Judge Paul Moss. Moss had a hunting lodge there and cut some timber. In the 1960s the land was owned by Willie Farah, of El Paso, Texas who built an airstrip there. Development of the community really began when the property was sold to the North American Land Development Corporation in March 1969. The volunteer fire department was begun in 1974, the firehouse was completed in 1981 and the post office opened that same year. In 1976 a missile from White Sands Missile Range went awry and landed in the middle of the community. The road into Timberon was paved in 2005.

In July 2016 a fire destroyed almost eighty structures, including forty-four homes in Timberon.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 309 people, 145 households, and 98 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 15.3 people per square mile (5.9/km).

==Education==
It is within Cloudcroft Municipal Schools.

In the 1970s children were bussed to the elementary school in Weed, New Mexico, but because of the difficulties of winter travel, an elementary school was established in December 1980 that operated just during the three winter months. The school building, known as the Little Red School House, offered Kindergarten through Sixth Grade instruction under the Alamogordo School District. By 1992 it became a year-round school. The projected enrollment for the 1992-1993 school year was around 9, but because multiple Weed parents decided to send their children to Timberon instead, the actual enrolled student count that year was 18. Weed Elementary School closed in August 1992 as the enrollment count was zero despite a projected enrollment of 18.

In November 1992 the Cloudcroft district&#x27;s board passed a resolution to annex portions of the Alamogordo district, including Timberon. In a separate motion the district drew new electoral boundaries with the annexed area effective the approval of said annexation.

The Little Red Schoolhouse continued under the administration of the Cloudcroft School District until May 2002, after which students were bussed to Cloudcroft.

<text>Tularosa is a village in Otero County, New Mexico, United States. It shares its name with the Tularosa Basin, in which the town is located. To the east, Tularosa is flanked by the western edge of the Sacramento Mountains. The population was 2,553 at the 2020 census. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the town, north of the much larger Alamogordo, experienced moderate growth and construction as a bedroom community, especially in the housing industry. Tularosa is noted for its abundance of cottonwood shade trees and its efforts to preserve the adobe-style architecture of its past.

==History==
Tularosa gets its name from the Spanish description for the red or rose colored reeds growing along the banks of the Rio Tularosa. The Rio Tularosa, which still exists along the north side of the village, attracted the original settlers as a water source in the desert. Settlers attempted to establish a settlement in 1860 but were unsuccessful due to Mescalero Apache raids. Two years later, after a battle at nearby Round Mountain, Mexican farmers from the Rio Grande valley succeeded in settling the area. The Mission Church, St Francis de Paula was built to honor a promise made to St Francis that if no one was killed in the battle at Round Mountain, the townspeople would build a church dedicated to him. In 1863, the Town of Tularosa was formally established and was mapped with 49 blocks and water rights distributed and recorded.

The original acequia (ditch irrigation system) remains virtually unchanged and provides the water for the trees lining the streets, private gardens, and landscaping that give Tularosa its unique character.

In 1979, the Tularosa Original Townsite District, consisting of the original 49 blocks on including 182 buildings, was declared a historic district and recorded in the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2008 Tularosa became an affiliate of Keep America Beautiful. The local branch of the program, Keep Tularosa Beautiful, received a grant in 2008 of $10,000 for beautification projects from Waste Management.

Luminarias line the church plaza and the highway on Christmas Eve, giving a soft glow of welcome to those driving through on U. S. Highways 70 and 54.
The luminaria display on Christmas Eve is perhaps Tularosa, New Mexico’s best-known treasure. This one-night-only display of light, love and tradition is one of the best parts of the holiday season in the Tularosa Basin.

Thousands of luminarias are displayed throughout the Village on Christmas Eve. A luminaria is a candle carefully set in sand inside of a paper bag and lit to create a warm glow at night.

There are sometimes conflicting opinions about the correct use of the term “luminaria”. Most of us refer to the paper bag lantern in this way, but traditionalists insist the correct term is &#x27;farolitos&#x27;. Historically, a true luminaria is a series of small bonfires lining the road. According to tripsavvy.com, luminarias have their roots in the 1800s. Originally, small bonfires were used to guide people to Christmas mass. Often, they are associated with the final night of Las Posadas, which is the symbolic representation of when Mary and Joseph were seeking shelter in Bethlehem, walking from home to home for a place to rest.

For about 20 years, most of the luminarias displayed in Tularosa were supplied through a cooperative effort between the Tularosa Chamber of Commerce and the Village of Tularosa.

<text>Tucumcari (; ) is a city in and the county seat of Quay County, New Mexico, United States. The population was 5,278 at the 2020 census. Tucumcari was founded in 1901, two years before Quay County was established.

==History==

In 1901, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad built a construction camp in the western portion of modern-day Quay County. Originally called Ragtown, the camp became known as &quot;Six Shooter Siding&quot;, due to numerous gunfights. Its first formal name, Douglas, was used only for a short time. After it grew into a permanent settlement, it was renamed Tucumcari in 1908. The name was taken from Tucumcari Mountain, which is situated near the community. The origin of the mountain&#x27;s name is uncertain; it may have been derived from the Comanche word &quot;tʉkamʉkarʉ&quot;, which means &#x27;ambush&#x27;. A 1777 burial record mentions a Comanche woman and her child captured in a battle at Cuchuncari, which is believed to be an early version of the name Tucumcari. A folk etymology for the town name claims that a Comanche saw a brakeman carrying a lantern and exclaimed &quot;&quot;tukaʔ manoori!&quot;, carry the light!&quot;, which the brakeman heard as &quot;&quot;tukama&quot; carry&quot;.

In December 1951, a water storage tank collapsed in the city. Four were killed and numerous buildings were destroyed.

In 2014, a series of suspicious fires destroyed abandoned buildings, including the Tucumcari Motel, Payless Motel, and a house in the 500 block of North Fourth Street. A former Tucumcari Police Department officer and several others have been charged with arson.

The town formerly hosted an air show each year. The show held on October 4, 2006, was canceled after one hour when a single-engine plane crashed, resulting in the pilot&#x27;s death.
===Former railroad transit point===
Tucumcari until the mid-twentieth century was a junction for transcontinental train service. The Rock Island Railroad ran pool train operations with the Southern Pacific (originally the El Paso and Northeastern Railway), with transfers at the station (for the Tucumcari-Los Angeles leg of the trip). The &quot;Choctaw Rocket&quot; (Memphis-Little Rock-Tucumcari-El Paso-Los Angeles) made the switch there (for the coach cars). The &quot;Golden State&quot; (Chicago-Kansas City-Topeka-Tucumcari-El Paso-Los Angeles) ran continuously through the town.

===Cattle ranches===

Owing to deterioration, Metropolitan Park was named to the New Mexico Heritage Preservation Alliance&#x27;s list of Most Endangered for 2003. In 2010, the park&#x27;s main building caught fire and burnt to the ground. The city of Tucumcari razed the site weeks after the fire.

===Tucumcari Tonite, Route 66, and tourism===

For many years, Tucumcari has been a popular stop for cross-country travelers on Interstate 40 (formerly U.S. Route 66 in the area). It is the largest city on the highway between Amarillo, Texas and Albuquerque, New Mexico. Billboards reading &quot;TUCUMCARI TONITE!&quot; placed along I-40 for many miles to the east and west of the town invite motorists to stay the night in one of Tucumcari&#x27;s &quot;2000&quot; (later changed to &quot;1200&quot;) motel rooms. The &quot;TUCUMCARI TONITE!&quot; campaign was abandoned in favor of a campaign which declared Tucumcari, &quot;Gateway to the West&quot;. However, on June 24, 2008, Tucumcari&#x27;s Lodgers Tax Advisory Board, the group responsible for the billboards, voted to return to the previous slogan.

Old U.S. Route 66 runs through the heart of Tucumcari via Route 66 Boulevard, which was previously known as Tucumcari Boulevard from 1970 to 2003 and as Gaynell Avenue before that time. Numerous businesses, including gasoline service stations, restaurants, and motels, were constructed to accommodate tourists as they traveled through on the Mother Road. A large number of the vintage motels and restaurants built in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s are still in business despite intense competition from newer chain motels and restaurants in the vicinity of Interstate 40, which passes through the city&#x27;s outskirts on the south.

Tucumcari is the home of over 50 murals. Most were painted by artists Doug and Sharon Quarles and serve as a tourist attraction.

* Crescent Creamery (vacant)
* Masonic Temple (still operating)
* Princess Theater (under renovation)

Also located in the downtown area are the concrete arches that once surrounded the Hotel Vorenburg, which was demolished in the 1970s after being damaged by fire. The Federal Building, commonly known as Sands-Dorsey Drug, was damaged by two fires before finally being demolished in 2015. The location is now a park.

<doc id="125956" wikidata="Q2349468" url="?curid=125956" title="Alcalde, New Mexico">
<text>Alcalde (Spanish for &quot;mayor&quot;) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, United States. In 2022, the Census Bureau lists the population at 235.

== Places to Visit ==
* The Oñate Monument Center located in Alcalde on New Mexico Highway 68.
* Historic site of Los Luceros Hacienda, an 18th century Spanish complex consisting of 5 buildings. Los Luceros was built in 1703 on the side of a land grant owned by Capitan Sebastian Martin Serrano. 
* El Alamo Winery has several Gold and Silver placing wines from the NM State Fair Wine Competitions in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.

== History ==
Each year on December 27, the city of Alcalde celebrates a feast day. One prominent focus of the celebration is when villagers enact Los Comanches, a poetic drama written 1780. The performance, based on true events, depicts the Spanish army&#x27;s defeat of Comanche leader, Green Horn.

=== Juan De Oñate ===
Juan de Oñate, nicknamed The Last Conquistador, lead the final Spanish funded colonization venture of nearly 500 people to colonize the area of northern New Mexico in 1598.

In the summer of 2020, two statues of Juan de Oñate were taken down amid longstanding tensions between Native Americans and Hispanics over Spain’s conquest of New Mexico. Gunfire erupted during a protest in Albuquerque, where demonstrators called for the removal of a statue of Oñate, the tyrannical conquistador whose legacy has become a focal point in the wider national movement to confront racial injustice. While protests across the country have targeted various symbols of oppression, including statues of Christopher Columbus, the focus in New Mexico is shifting toward challenging symbols of colonial violence.

Earlier that day, authorities in the northern town of Alcalde removed another statue of Oñate, whose harsh rule as governor played a pivotal role in establishing centuries of Spanish control in the region.

=== Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe ===
Renowned artist Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe created the oil painting titled &quot;Near Alcalde, New Mexico, 1931&quot; as a depiction of the Spanish Mission Church just outside of Alcalde. The painting is now housed in the Yale University Art Gallery.

<text>Chama is a village in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, United States. The population was 917 at the 2020 census. The village is located in the Rocky Mountains about south of the Colorado-New Mexico border.

==Geography==
Chama is located on the Rio Chama, south of the Colorado border. According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it land.

==History==
Chama was originally part of the Tierra Amarilla Land Grant. In 1880 the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad began construction of its San Juan Extension from Antonito, Colorado westward toward a mining district in the northern San Juan Basin of Colorado. The railroad needed an engine terminal for helper locomotives, near to the western foot of the steep gradient toward Cumbres Pass. It chose a site on the western bank of the Rio Chama where the railroad crossed it, for the terminal and its supporting townsite, naming the village for the river crossing. Train service began on February 1, 1881 and a post office was established that year. 

The northern valley of the Rio Chama had extensive coniferous forest, with dense stands of Ponderosa pine. Timber harvesting and sawmilling rapidly developed from the early 1880&#x27;s, and was a major industry into the 1930&#x27;s.
Chama is now the western terminus of the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad, a steam-driven, narrow gauge heritage railway which carries visitors to and from Osier, Colorado, and Antonito, Colorado, during the summer months. This is the remaining 64 mile portion of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande&#x27;s San Juan Extension between Alamosa, and Durango, Colorado. The tracks from Chama westward to Durango were abandoned in September 1967 and torn up soon afterwards.

==History==
Dulce was founded by the Gomez family as a ranching operation. The original name was &quot;Agua Dulce,&quot; Spanish for sweet water because of the presence of natural springs that provided good drinking water for the people and their animals. The original homestead was founded in 1877 by Jose Eugenio Gomez. The Jicarilla Apache reservation was established in 1887 when the Apache people were forced into a reservation. The Gomez Ranch is currently kept under Manuel Gomez ownership, though surrounded by reservation land.

The Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad constructed its San Juan Extension through Dulce in 1882, and a post office was established in 1892. A sawmill was established here, and a logging railroad running southwest as far as Mills Lake from about 1914, both of which closed around 1930. 

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and (0.8%) is water.

<doc id="125960" wikidata="Q1554220" url="?curid=125960" title="Santa Clara Pueblo, New Mexico">
<text>Santa Clara Pueblo (in Tewa: Khaʼpʼoe Ówîngeh [xɑ̀ʔp’òː ʔówîŋgè]) &quot;Singing Water Village&quot;, also known as &quot;Village of Wild Roses&quot; is a census-designated place (CDP) in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, United States and a federally recognized tribe of Native American Pueblo people.

The pueblo is a member of the Eight Northern Pueblos, and the people are from the Tewa ethnic group of Native Americans who speak the Rio Grande Tewa language. The pueblo is on the Rio Grande, between Ohkay Owingeh (formerly San Juan Pueblo) to the north and San Ildefonso Pueblo (P&#x27;ohwhóge Owingeh) to the south.

Santa Clara Pueblo is famous for producing hand-crafted pottery, specifically blackware and redware with deep engravings. The pueblo is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Santa Clara Pueblo is located approximately 1.5 miles south of Española on NM 30.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 2.1 square miles (5.4 km), all land.

==Demographics==
The 2010 census found that 1,018 people lived in the CDP, while 1,182 people in the United States reported being exclusively Santa Claran and 1,425 people reported being Santa Claran exclusively or in combination with another group.
==History==

Tewa people lived in the Pueblo area for millennia before they met Spanish conquistador Juan de Oñate and his exploration party on July 11, 1598. Pueblo archaeology shows that Ancestral Puebloans lived in the general region as far back as 1200 BC.

First visited in 1541, a segment of Francisco Coronado&#x27;s expeditionary force met with the residents of the nearby Caypa Pueblo. After annexation of the region into the Spanish Kingdom, and as part of the 1601 expansion of Oñate&#x27;s colonial capital, a chapel was built there by 1617. Fray Alonso de Benavides established a mission in 1628. The mission was abandoned on the lead up to the Great Pueblo Revolt of 1680.

This Pueblo joined forces with others nearby and fought against the Spanish Royal Government in 1680 in the revolt. The original and unoccupied chapel was destroyed. Two other chapel buildings would be constructed there. The current church replaced the former in 1918.

In 1782, a smallpox outbreak decimated the population. The eighth section of the Act of July 22, 1854, mandated a census of the newly acquired possessions of the US government. In review of the land&#x27;s title, the pueblo presented a Spanish Royal decree dated October 15, 1713, that the title to land and various pueblos could be expected. Though lost, the decree on the title papers assured protection of the pueblos&#x27; right to protection of their homelands from encroachment. The result of the title research led this Pueblo community to be of the first recognized by United States Congress.

==Education==
It is in the Española Public Schools district. The comprehensive public high school is Española Valley High School.

There is a Bureau of Indian Education (BIE)-affiliated tribal elementary school, Kha&#x27;p&#x27;o Community School, in Santa Clara Pueblo.

==Arts ==
Among the arts practiced at Santa Clara Pueblo, pottery is one of the most well-known. Traditionally, pottery was made primarily by girls and women, and while many potters today are women, there are many men who make pottery as well. Santa Clara Pueblo potters are known for their black polished and red polished pottery in a distinctive style, especially the use of incised work. &quot;Knife-wing&quot; or eagle feather designs are common on Santa Clara pottery There are a number of well-known ceramic artists from Santa Clara. Four approaches are used in the decoration of the majority of Santa Clara Pueblo ceramics: painted designs, impressed patterns, incised designs, and resist-firing with incised or sgraffito designs.

<text>Portales () is a city in and the county seat of Roosevelt County, New Mexico, United States. Its population was 12,280 at the 2010 census. Portales is located near the larger city of Clovis, and Cannon Air Force Base, a major contributor to the economy of the region.

Eastern New Mexico University opened in Portales in 1934 as Eastern New Mexico Junior College, and has since grown to become the third-largest university in the state. The area is one of the largest producers of Valencia peanuts in the United States and is the nation&#x27;s top producer of certified organic peanut butter. Portales is home to about 40 dairies and a major US dairy solids plant, together producing and exporting hundreds of millions of dollars of local milk products each year. It is the principal city of the Portales micropolitan statistical area, which is part of the larger Clovis-Portales combined statistical area, including Clovis, away and Cannon Air Force Base, away.

==History==
The US territorial settlement of Portales occurred in the late 19th century as cattle herders discovered a water source emanating from a rocky ledge resembling a Spanish porch. The local watering hole took on the name &quot;Portales&quot;, and a few settlers began ranching nearby. The Pecos Valley and Northeastern Railroad arrived in 1899. The City of Portales was formally established in 1909. The first mayor of Portales was Washington Ellsworth Lindsey, who later became a governor of New Mexico.

The town developed in an orderly fashion through the early 20th century.
In particular, given its access to the Ogallala Aquifer, improved surface irrigation techniques supported steady growth in agriculture.

Eastern New Mexico University was established in 1934 as a teacher&#x27;s college. Originally a junior college, it became a four-year institution in the mid-20th century. The Great Depression brought several important Works Progress Administration construction projects, including the ENMU Administration Building, the downtown Portales Post Office, and the Roosevelt County Courthouse. All three buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== &quot;Felix v. City of Bloomfield&quot; ==

In April 2007, Bloomfield attracted attention and some controversy when the city council voted unanimously to erect a stone monument of the Ten Commandments at the city hall. Two residents sued the city in 2012 &quot;alleging it violated their constitutional rights and represented a government endorsement of religion&quot;. In August 2014, a federal judge ruled the monument must be removed. The city&#x27;s response to the lawsuit was that it was a local group that paid for the memorial and they had added a disclaimer. A district judge decided that a &quot;reasonable observer would interpret the monument as the government endorsing a religion&quot;. The ACLU became involved and the city asked the Supreme Court to hear the case, but was refused. The city owed court fees of $700,000 to the ACLU and the monument was moved to &quot;property owned by a Baptist church. The city has been looking for outside funds to pay the fee, but in June 2018, it released its 2019 budget which calls for &quot;paying $233,000 toward the money it owes from the ... lawsuit&quot;. The city has until 2021 to pay the amount in full. Hemant Mehta stated that the &quot;city officials were goaded by the Christian Right into fighting back. &quot;

<doc id="125969" wikidata="Q1012695" url="?curid=125969" title="Farmington, New Mexico">
<text>Farmington (Navajo: Tóta&#x27;) is a city in San Juan County in the U.S. state of New Mexico. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 46,624 people. Farmington (and surrounding San Juan County) makes up one of the four metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in New Mexico.

Farmington is located at the junction of the San Juan River, the Animas River, and the La Plata River, and is located on the Colorado Plateau. Farmington is the largest city of San Juan County, one of the geographically largest counties in the United States covering . Farmington serves as the commercial hub for most of northwestern New Mexico and the Four Corners region of four states. Farmington lies at or near the junction of several highways: U.S. Highway 64, New Mexico Highway 170, New Mexico Highway 371, and New Mexico Highway 516.

It is on the Trails of the Ancients Byway, one of the designated New Mexico Scenic Byways.

The primary non-government industries of Farmington are the production of petroleum, natural gas, and coal and its function as a major retail hub. Outside of Farmington, the Navajo Mine (coal), operated by the Navajo Transitional Energy Company (NTEC), is used entirely for fuel for the nearby Four Corners Generating Station to produce electric power.

==History==
The area that is now Farmington was settled by Ancestral Pueblo people in the 7th Century. Ruins can be visited at nearby Salmon Ruins and at the Aztec Ruins. When the Ancestral Puebloans left the area, the Navajos, Jicarilla Apaches, and Utes moved into the area. A key part of the region was known in Navajo as &quot;Tóta&quot;&#x27; which means &quot;where three rivers meet&quot;.

Although Spanish and American mineral prospecting happened in the area, there were few permanent settlements. In 1868, the Navajo Nation was created, taking up the western half of San Juan County. Six years later, the U.S. government offered territory in the rest of San Juan County to the Jicarilla Apache but they refused. As a result, the area was opened for settlement and a number of settlers moved into the region from Southern Colorado. The area was originally known as &quot;Junction City&quot; because of the access to the three rivers.

In 1901 the town was incorporated and named Farmington with a population of 548. By September 19, 1905, the railroad was finished connecting Farmington to Durango, Colorado, expanding economic and settlement opportunities. It was unusual in that it was a standard-gauge railway that connected to the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad narrow-gauge lines of southwestern Colorado. The railroad converted the line to narrow gauge in 1923. The line was abandoned in 1968 and dismantled to Durango in 1969. In addition, in the 1920s there was significant investment in natural gas and oil in the area, although actual production remained low until the 1950s. 

On March 18, 1950, Farmington was the site of a mass UFO sighting in which over half the town&#x27;s population was reported to have seen large saucers in the sky flying at rapid speeds. The population was expanding rapidly after the 1940s construction of a developed road connecting Farmington to U.S. Route 66 and Albuquerque and the San Juan Basin Natural Gas Pipeline in 1953, led by Tom Bolack. However, the significant connection to the energy industry made the economics of the town largely vulnerable to international market fluctuations during the 1970s energy crisis and resulted in some economic diversification.

In 1967, as part of a joint U.S. Government-El Paso Electric operation, an underground nuclear detonation occurred east of Farmington and about south of Dulce, New Mexico in present-day Carson National Forest. This pilot project of Operation Plowshare, code-named Project Gasbuggy, was an attempt to fracture a large volume of underground bedrock to make more natural gas available for extraction by gas wells.

The people of Farmington have been the subject of several civil rights investigations, including the 2005 report, &quot;The Farmington Report: Civil Rights for Native Americans 30 Years Later&quot;.

<doc id="125981" wikidata="Q2006486" url="?curid=125981" title="Shiprock, New Mexico">
<text>Shiprock () is an unincorporated community on the Navajo reservation in San Juan County, New Mexico, United States. The population was 7,718 people in the 2020 census. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Shiprock as a census-designated place (CDP). It is part of the Farmington Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Shiprock is named after the nearby Shiprock rock formation. Since 1903, the town has been called &quot;Naat’áanii Nééz&quot; (meaning “tall leader” in the Navajo language) after the San Juan Indian Agency superintendent William T. Shelton who settled Shiprock for the United States government.

Diné College is a local four-year college (formerly Navajo Community College), a tribally controlled community college with seven other campuses across the Navajo Nation. It is the site of a Chapter House for the Navajo, a Bureau of Indian Affairs agency and the Northern Navajo Medical Center (an Indian Health Service hospital).

The town is a key road junction for truck traffic and tourists visiting the Four Corners, Mesa Verde, Shiprock and the Grand Canyon. It lies at the intersection of U.S. Route 64 and U.S. Route 491 (formerly U.S. Route 666). The annual Northern Navajo Fair is held every October. Since 1984, the community has hosted the Shiprock Marathon and Relay.

==History ==
Shiprock was founded on September 11, 1903, by San Juan Agency superintendent William Taylor Shelton after being assigned to the northern Navajo by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. A former U.S. government instructor in agriculture at the Cherokee School in Yellow Hill, North Carolina (now Cherokee, NC), Shelton had moved up through BIA ranks to be given the appointment to open an Indian agency and boarding school. He founded Shiprock Indian School and administrative agency with a staff of three white and three Navajo employees. Shiprock Indian Boarding School remained until the American Indian boarding school system was phased out in the early 1980s.

The settlement encompassed land originally belonging to Tséheya Begay. According to one of Shelton&#x27;s early reports, Navajo had been irrigating the land for many years, with 275 farms drawing water from approximately 25 ditches between the Shiprock area and Farmington. Under Shelton, the agency expanded the irrigation system and developed a dairy herd as part of its agricultural program; a sawmill near Sanostee and coal mine in the Hogback area were also developed. Early buildings in Shiprock were constructed of log and adobe, but brick replaced these materials after the disastrous flood of 1912. The superintendent was known as a disciplinarian who was ruthless in his prosecution of “moral lapses,” but is said to have been generally respected throughout the region, particularly for his efforts in adding the Utah-Colorado extension to the main Navajo Reservation.

Navajo Corrections operated the Shiprock District Department of Corrections jail facility in Shiprock. It had a capacity of twelve, and after being cited for mold complaints, closed in 2021.

<text>Las Vegas, often known simply as Vegas, is a city in and the county seat of San Miguel County, New Mexico, United States. Once two separate municipalities (one a city and the other a town), both were named Las Vegas: West Las Vegas (&quot;Old Town&quot;) and East Las Vegas (&quot;New Town&quot;). They are separated by the Gallinas River and retain distinct characters and separate, rival school districts.

The population was 13,166 at the 2020 census. Las Vegas is located south of Raton, east of Santa Fe, northeast of Albuquerque, south of Colorado Springs, Colorado, and south of Denver.

==History==
Las Vegas was established in 1835 after a group of settlers received a land grant from the Mexican government. (The land had previously been granted to Luis María Cabeza de Baca, whose family later received a settlement.) The town was laid out in the traditional Spanish Colonial style, with a central plaza surrounded by buildings which could serve as fortifications in case of attack. Las Vegas soon prospered as a stop on the Santa Fe Trail. During the Mexican–American War in 1846, Stephen W. Kearny delivered an address at the Plaza of Las Vegas claiming New Mexico for the United States. In 1847, the town was the site of the Battle of Las Vegas, which was a part of the broader Taos Revolt by local Hispanos and Pueblo peoples against United States occupation. In 1860, the United States Congress passed a law allowing the Cabeza de Baca heirs to choose other grants in lieu of their Las Vegas grant.

In 1877 Las Vegas College, the precursor to Regis University, was founded in Las Vegas by a group of exiled Italian Jesuits. In 1887, Las Vegas College moved to Denver whereupon the name was changed.

The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad arrived at Las Vegas from the north on July 4, 1879. To maintain control of development rights, it established a station and related development one mile (1.6 km) east of the Plaza, creating a separate, rival New Town, as occurred elsewhere in the Old West. The same competing development occurred in Albuquerque, for instance. During the railroad era Las Vegas boomed, quickly becoming one of the largest cities in the American Southwest. Turn-of-the-century Las Vegas featured all the modern amenities, including an electric street railway, the &quot;Duncan Opera House&quot; at the northeast corner of 6th Street and Douglas Avenue, a Carnegie library, the Castañeda Hotel (a major Harvey House), and the New Mexico Normal School (now New Mexico Highlands University). Since the decline and restructuring of the railroad industry began in the 1950s, the city&#x27;s population has remained relatively constant. Although the two towns have been combined, separate school districts have been maintained (Las Vegas City Schools and West Las Vegas School District).

The anti-colonist organization Las Gorras Blancas was active in the area in the 1890s.

===Cowboy Reunions===
Beginning in 1915, the Las Vegas Cowboys&#x27; Reunions were held annually until 1931; then in 1939, the Cowboys&#x27; Reunions were re-established. Their slogan was, &quot;Git Fer Vegas, Cowboy!&quot; These reunions were organized by a group of ranching families and cowboys which soon became the Las Vegas Cowboys&#x27; Reunion Association. The Reunions celebrated ranching life, which began in northern New Mexico in the early 1800s and continues into the 21st century. The annual affair included pie eating contests, barbecues, parades, banquets, balls, and &quot;ranch rodeos.&quot; In the early years, celebrities—cowhands as well as big-name bands, movie stars like Tom Mix, and artists such as Randall Davey—came to Las Vegas for this event. In later years, famous cowhands participated in the Cowboys&#x27; Reunion Rodeos. The Cowboys&#x27; Reunions reflected the occupations of the area and attracted huge crowds for their four days of events. In 1952, the Cowboys&#x27; Reunion Association invited the Rough Riders Association to join them at the annual rodeo.

===Outlaws===
The arrival of the railroad in 1879 brought with it businesses, development and new residents, both respectable and dubious. Murderers, robbers, thieves, gamblers, gunmen, swindlers, vagrants, and tramps poured in, transforming the eastern side of the settlement into a virtually lawless brawl. Among the notorious characters were such legends of the Old West as: dentist Doc Holliday and his girlfriend Big Nose Kate, Dave Rudabaugh, Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp, Mysterious Dave Mather, Hoodoo Brown, and Handsome Harry the Dancehall Rustler.

Historian Ralph Emerson Twitchell once claimed regarding the Old West, &quot;Without exception there was no town which harbored a more disreputable gang of desperadoes and outlaws than did Las Vegas.&quot;

==Libraries and museums==

New Mexico Highlands University, founded 1893, is home to the Thomas C. Donnelly Library. It supports the teaching, research and community activities of New Mexico Highlands University. It acquires, organizes, preserves and provides access to pertinent information and scholarly materials for curricular needs, intellectual pursuits and personal enrichment of its clientele. It promotes programs and services that emphasize the diversity of the university&#x27;s multicultural community and heritage. An addition increased the square footage from 23,700 to 53,500 and now holds a book collection of almost 200,000 volumes.

Las Vegas&#x27; Carnegie Library, established in 1904, is the only surviving Carnegie Library in New Mexico. Built from a $10,000 donation from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, its Neo-Classical Revival architecture resembles Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Monticello. The library sits in the middle of a park that occupies an entire city block, bordered by Victorian-style homes and buildings.

The City of Las Vegas Museum &amp; Rough Rider Memorial on Grand Avenue, dedicated in 1940, was first established by the decision of Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Rough Riders regiment (the first Volunteer Cavalry Regiment of the Spanish–American War), who named Las Vegas its official reunion home. Their first reunion was held in Las Vegas, June 1899.

The museum, free and open to the public, houses a memorial collection of artifacts, archives and photographs from the Rough Riders and mementos in relation to the 1898 Cuban Campaign of the Spanish–American War, with information on over 200 members of the original regiment, RRR Association documents, etc. The museum illuminates the history of Las Vegas, its connection to the Rough Riders, the Santa Fe Trail and the development of New Mexico. It features collections of local Native American pottery, household items, costumes, ranching and farming equipment, agricultural and mercantile operations, and home life.

Housed in a 1940 Works Progress Administration-funded building, the museum is built of stone, with Pueblo Revival nuances.

== Cochiti pueblo and Cochiti people ==
The Cochiti pueblo people are a federally recognized tribe of Native Americans. According to the Keres Online Dictionary the Keresan-name for the People of Cochiti Pueblo is K’úutìim’é (&quot;People from the Mountains, i.e. Cochiti people&quot;).

The Cochiti speak Eastern Keres, a dialect of the Keresan language, a language isolate. In the early 21st century, the Keres Children&#x27;s Learning Center, an independent Keres immersion school, was founded to aid with preservation of their language and culture. It has added grades since its founding.

The pueblo administers of reservation land and works closely with the Bureau of Land Management who has jurisdiction over Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument.

The pueblo celebrates the annual feast day for its patron saint, San Buenaventura, on July 14.

== History ==
The Cochiti people are thought to be descended from the Ancestral Puebloans (formerly known as the Anasazi). The ancestors of the Cochiti people, living in cliff dwellings at Rito de los Frijoles in present-day Bandelier National Monument, divided into two groups. One was located in the pueblo of Katishtya (later called San Felipe pueblo) in the south and the other was located in Potrero Viejo, one of the finger mesas of the Pajarito Plateau in northern central New Mexico. Approximately 12 miles northwest of the present-day Cochiti Pueblo, a temporary pueblo known as Hanut Cochiti had been established.

In 1598, Spanish conquistador, Juan de Oñate came to Cochiti Pueblo. At first, the Spaniards admired and respected the Pueblo Peoples for their Spanish-like farming techniques and villages, viewing them as equals, and opening trade. As time went on, the Spaniards attempted to assimilate Cochiti people (and other tribes) into New Spanish society. They were forced to pay taxes in crops, cotton, and work. The Spanish Catholic missionaries attacked their religion and renamed the Pueblos with Catholic saints’ names and began a program of church construction, such as the San Buenaventura Mission at Cochiti, routinely torturing the tribes for practicing their traditional religion, and forcing them into labor and/or slavery.

The Cochiti pueblo people took part in the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, an uprising of the Native Americans against the Spaniards. When Spanish Governor Antonio de Otermin reconquered New Mexico, the tribe retreated with the other Keresan tribes of San Felipe and Santo Domingo (now called Kewa) to the Potrero Viejo. The Cochiti people remained at Potrero Viejo until 1693 when they were forced to flee Spanish Governor Don Diego de Vargas and his troops.

== Art ==

Potters of Cochiti and Kewa Pueblo (formerly Santo Domingo Pueblo) have made traditional pots for centuries, developing styles for different purposes and expressing deep beliefs in their designs. Since the early decades of the 20th century, these pots have been appreciated by a wider audience outside the pueblos. Continuing to use traditional techniques, in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, potters have also expanded their designs and repertoire in pottery, which has an international market.

==Education==
It is in the Bernalillo Public Schools district, which operates Cochiti Elementary &amp; Middle Schools in nearby Peña Blanca, and Bernalillo High School.

<text>Jemez Springs (pronounced HEH-mes) is a village in Sandoval County, New Mexico, United States. The population was 250 at the 2010 census. Named for the nearby Pueblo of Jemez, the village is the site of Jemez State Monument and the headquarters of the Jemez Ranger District. The village and nearby locations in the Jemez Valley are the site of hot springs and several religious retreats.

==Geography==
Situated in the Jemez Mountains, Jemez Springs is located entirely within the Santa Fe National Forest. The village is sited on the Jemez River in the red rock San Diego Canyon. State Highway 4 passes through the settlement on the east bank of the Rio Grande tributary. Geothermal springs in and near the village feed the Jemez River. The village has a total area of , all land.

==History==

The Jemez Valley is thought to have been inhabited for the last 4500 years. The Spaniards who visited the area beginning in 1540 reported multiple Native American pueblos (villages), in the valley. The Franciscan mission church San José de los Jemez was built just to the north of the current village in 1621 but was abandoned around the 1640s. Today the ruins are the site of Jemez State Monument. Following the Pueblo Revolt the Jemez people began converging at the current Pueblo of Jemez. In the nineteenth century the valley was given over to mostly agrarian and pastoral uses.

Jemez Springs&#x27; post office opened in 1907. The village is named for the Pueblo of Jemez twelve miles to the south. The 1907 post office was preceded by one established in 1884 named &quot;Archuleta&quot;. The village&#x27;s current main bathhouse originates from this period.

In 1942, Jemez Springs was the second choice (after Oak City, Utah) for the location of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the proposed Manhattan Project research laboratory, but Los Alamos was chosen instead.

In 1947 two Roman Catholic retreats were founded nearby, the Congregation of the Servants of the Paraclete and the Handmaids of the Precious Blood. The village was incorporated on December 5, 1955. Following enthusiasm from supporters of Kyozan Joshu Sasaki, the Bodhi Manda Zen Center was founded in 1972.

In 2022, Tesla leased Santa Ana tribal land to build a new service and delivery center, something that they cannot do on non-Federal-jurisdiction land in the state due to New Mexico legislation requiring the use of automobile dealers as intermediaries in selling cars to consumers, something Tesla has been unwilling to do. The store opened in 2023 and is five times larger than the first New Mexico Tesla facility on tribal land, a service center built the previous year in Nambe.

==Education==
Most of Santa Ana Pueblo is in the Bernalillo Public Schools district. Some is in the Jemez Valley Public Schools district. The former operates Bernalillo Middle School (the zoned middle school of the Bernalillo portion of this community), and Bernalillo High School.

<text>Santo Domingo Pueblo, also known Kewa Pueblo (also spelled Kiua, Eastern Keres , Keres: Díiwʾi, Navajo: Tó Hájiiloh) is a federally recognized tribe of Native American Pueblo people in northern New Mexico. A population of 2,456 (as of 2010) live in structures some of which date from circa 1700; in Sandoval County (~35 miles (56 km) northeast of Albuquerque, New Mexico, off Interstate 25 southwest of Santa Fe) described by the U.S. Census Bureau as a census-designated place.

A area of the pueblo was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The listing included 80 contributing buildings.

== Culture ==

The population of the pueblo is composed of Native Americans who speak Keres, an eastern dialect of the Keresan languages. Like several other Pueblo peoples, they have a matrilineal kinship system, in which children are considered born into the mother&#x27;s family and clan, and inheritance and property pass through the maternal line. The pueblo celebrates an annual feast day on August 4 to honor their patron saint, Saint Dominic. More than 2,000 Pueblo people participate in the traditional corn dances held at this time.

== Name ==

On the Catholic saint&#x27;s day of Santo Domingo in August 1598, conquistador Juan de Oñate had his first encounter with Kewa Pueblo. The Pueblo was subsequently named &quot;Santo Domingo&quot;. Its earliest recorded name was &quot;Gipuy&quot;. According to Pueblo Council members, the local name in their Keres language has always been Kewa. In 2009, the pueblo officially changed its name to Kewa Pueblo, altering its seal, signs and letterhead.

According to the Pueblo of Acoma&#x27;s Keres Online Dictionary, the Western Keresan-name for the pueblo was &quot;Díiwʾi&quot; and for its people therefore &quot;Dîiwʾamʾé&quot;.

== Geography ==

Kewa Pueblo is located at (35.514483, -106.363429). The pueblo is located approximately southwest of Santa Fe. Interstate 25 runs to the east of the community. The pueblo is part of the Albuquerque Metropolitan Statistical Area.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Santo Domingo CDP that overlays the pueblo has a total area of , all land.

== Demographics ==

The 2010 census found that 2,456 people lived in the CDP, while 3,519 people in the U.S. reported being exclusively Santo Domingo Puebloan and 4,430 people reported being Santo Domingo Puebloan exclusively or in combination with another group.

The state of New Mexico has reported the population as 3,100.

== History ==

The pueblo plays a supporting role in Spanish colonial history. Francisco Vázquez de Coronado made first contact with Kewa in 1540. When the Spanish first came to the Rio Grande Valley, they found over 70 villages that manufactured goods and had a strong trade network. Kewa was one of these villages. After first contact, Spanish expeditions into the area continued, one of them being Juan de Oñate&#x27;s expedition in 1598. Oñate arrived in Kewa Pueblo with the intention of bringing Kewa and pueblos in its vicinity under Spanish rule. Soon after his visit, a mission was established and a church was built. In 1680, Kewa and other nearby pueblos rose in revolt against their Spanish colonizers, killing four priests and Spanish settlers nearby. Similar strife occurred again during the tail end of Spanish colonization in the area in 1696. In both cases, the revolts were eventually quelled by the Spanish. A century later, in 1807, Lieutenant Zebulon Pike visited Kewa. In his journal, he described the church as adorned with elegantly ornamented paintings, one of which being Saint Domingo.

Gaspar Castaño de Sosa, a fugitive from the Crown, was arrested at the pueblo in March 1591. Castaño, a notorious slaver, had fled capture. He pursued an illegal claims expedition up the Pecos River, which had not yet been seen by Europeans. He made it as far as Pecos Pueblo, and raided it for slaves. He turned west and traveled toward modern-day Santa Fe, which had been established by the Spanish. He followed the Rio Grande river valley south. On orders of the Viceroy at Mexico City, Captain Juan Morlette found Castaño at Kewa Pueblo and arrested him. He returned him to authorities to face trial for his crimes, including his attack on Pecos Pueblo.

Castaño abandoned two interpreters at Kewa Pueblo; he had kidnapped them earlier and brought them with him. Governor Juan de Oñate&#x27;s expedition recorded encountering Tomas and Cristobal at Kewa Pueblo, as it traveled north.

===20th century to present===

Potters of Kewa and Cochiti Pueblos have made stylized pottery for centuries, developing styles for different purposes and expressing deep beliefs in their designs. Since the early decades of the 20th century, these pots have been appreciated by a wider audience outside the pueblos. Continuing to use traditional techniques, in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, potters have also expanded their designs and repertoire in pottery, which has an international market.

== Belief system ==

Kewa Indians, similar to other Indian populations in the Rio Grande region, believe their people emerged from the inner earth from a place in the north called Shipap. As the legend goes, from Shipap they migrated southwards, breaking off into smaller groups along the way. These breakaway groups would go on to found other pueblos.

== Government ==

The highest official in the pueblo is called the Cacique. Although he is the highest ranking official, he does not serve as ruler. Rather, he serves as a priest, and conducts a multitude of religious ceremonies.

== Visual arts ==

Kewa artists are known for their stonework jewelry, including flat disks or beads called &quot;heishi&quot;, meaning &quot;shell bead&quot; in Eastern Keresan, which are often made into necklaces.

Angie Reano Owen grew up in the Reano family of heishi beadmakers. She is a Kewa inlay jeweler and lapidary artist. Her designs are inspired by prehistoric Anasazi and Hohokam inlay designs. Today, the Reano family has continued to develop the art of shell and stone inlay jewelry.

=== Pottery ===

Pottery is an important art form and utilitarian craft from Kewa Pueblo. Large ollas and dough bowls are common forms for Kewa potters. Many Kewa potters are women, although men can also create ceramics. In the 1920&#x27;s, tourism catalyzed by a nearby railway stop in the town of Wallace, drew attention to Kewa and its pottery. Pottery would become a valuable export for Kewa during this time.

The Aguilar Family, consisting of two sisters and one sister-in-law, created Kewa pottery from 1910 until approximately 1915 and became very well-known for their artwork.

Robert Tenorio has continued his family legacy by making traditional Kewa pottery, and Tenorio&#x27;s sister was part of a well-known husband-wife pottery collaboration called, Arthur and Hilda Coriz.

== Education ==

It is in the Bernalillo Public Schools district, which operates Santo Domingo Elementary and Middle Schools, and Bernalillo High School.

The school district states that Cochiti Elementary and Middle Schools in Peña Blanca and Bernalillo Middle School have students from Kewa Pueblo. Bernalillo Middle School (a zoned middle school of this community), Some elementary-aged students from Kewa Pueblo attend Algodones Elementary School in Algodones.

<doc id="126004" wikidata="Q2223600" url="?curid=126004" title="Agua Fria, New Mexico">
<text>Agua Fria (Spanish for &quot;cold water&quot;) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, United States. It is part of the Santa Fe, New Mexico Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,800 at the 2010 census. Agua Fria Village is a &quot;Traditional Historic Community&quot; (THC) as designated by the Santa Fe Board of County Commissioners in 1995 and subsequent Santa Fe County Ordinance #1996-16, as allowed by State Statute (3-7-1.1 and 3-2-3 (C) NMSA 1978).

==History==

Native Americans lived in this area circa 3,000-3,500 BCE because of the water availability and moderate temperatures (about 30 fewer freezing days than in Santa Fe). Recent archaeological work shows a presence in this area back to 7,000 BCE.

The Spanish under command of Juan de Oñate passed through this area on the way to founding the first capital of New Mexico San Gabriel in 1598 (near present-day San Juan Pueblo – Okhay Owinge). The first recorded settlement was circa 1640 by the grandparents of Major Roque Madrid (the area then known as Pueblo Quemado for a burnt native town in the area). The grandfather Francisco de Madrid may have &#x27;dropped off&#x27; from a 1603 expedition to farm this area (he is the namesake of Madrid, New Mexico, a mining area).

As these settlements of Cieneguitas, Agua Fria and Cieneguilla expanded in Spanish Colonial New Mexico, they were called Ranchitos, as the population grew they became a Placita. Agua Fria was identified by two groups. The area by the Church was “La Placita de Los Romeros” and the other one in the area of the Tanque, the “watering hole” (area of Lopez Lane and Camino de Oro Road) became “La Placita de Los Lopez.” As the community grew, it acquired the status of a Village.

In the year 1776, Fray Francisco Atanacio Dominguez gave a census count to his superiors listing Agua Fria with 57 families and 297 persons; but at this time it was still known as Pueblo Quemado.

U.S. Army Colonel John M. Washington&#x27;s Expedition to Navajo Country passed through Agua Fria on August 16, 1849. This was the first known American reference to the community. The parroquia of Santa Fe was administered under the auspices of the Diocese of Durango, Mexico in the 1800s. Even though the people in Agua Fria had a strong faith, they found it difficult to attend church regularly, so they founded their own mission in the Village in 1835.

==Geography==
The traditional boundaries of the Village are from Camino Carlos Rael (west boundary of Frenchy&#x27;s Field Park) on the east to San Felipe Road on the west (rejected Cienguilla Grant boundary), to Arroyo de los Chamisos on the south (present day Santa Fe Place Mall), to Arroyo de los Frijoles on the north (the arroyo is a City of Santa Fe walking trail, but it might be described as Las Companas subdivision, just north of State Road 599). The present-day THC boundaries are much smaller (basically Siler Road on east, Lopez Lane and Jemez Road on west, Rufina Street on south, and State Road 599 on north).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and (3.8%) is water.

<doc id="126007" wikidata="Q3549213" url="?curid=126007" title="Uncle Jam Wants You">
<text>Uncle Jam Wants You is a concept album by American funk rock band Funkadelic. It was released by Warner Bros. Records on September 21, 1979, and was later reissued on CD by Priority Records. It was produced by George Clinton under the alias Dr. Funkenstein. It is the first Funkadelic album since &quot;America Eats Its Young&quot; in 1972 not to sport a cover illustrated by Funkadelic artist Pedro Bell, though Bell did provide artwork for the album’s back cover and interior. &quot;Uncle Jam Wants You&quot; was the second Funkadelic album to be certified gold. The album peaked at No. 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

==Significance==
&quot;Uncle Jam Wants You&quot; (a reference to the &quot;Uncle Sam wants you!&quot; US Army recruitment posters) may be a more militant sequel to the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;One Nation Under a Groove&quot;, with the band waging war against the rise of disco. Its purpose is also (as the cover claims) to &quot;rescue dance music from the blahs.&quot;

The cover art depicts George Clinton in a Huey Newton-Black Panthers pose. The album features the band&#x27;s last big hit single, &quot;(Not Just) Knee Deep&quot;, an edited version of which went to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Soul singles charts. The album title was adopted by the DJ organization known as Uncle Jamm&#x27;s Army.

Samples of the 15-minute cut &quot;(Not Just) Knee Deep&quot; can be heard on Digital Underground&#x27;s &quot;Kiss You Back&quot;; the track has also been used by De La Soul for their song &quot;Me Myself and I&quot;.

==Reception==

With a 4 out of 5 star rating, Paul Sexton of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; wrote: &quot;Last year the Funkadelic battle campaign was based on the idea of having one nation under a groove. This year the plan is to &quot;Rescue Dance Music from the Blahs&quot;. No, I don&#x27;t understand either, but once again this is marvellously enjoyable comic book funk.&quot; The &quot;Bay State Banner&quot; concluded that, &quot;on Side Two and &#x27;Freak of the Week&#x27;, we find the sort of directionless noise that sometimes ruins Funkadelic concerts—rhythmic anarchy and vocal chipmunk-ism instead of the clean and nasty, low-register funk and howling, inconsolable guitar solos.&quot; The &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; determined that &quot;the cover is misleading; one expects a record jammed with disco tracks and instead receives sensitive, even contemplative rhythm and blues.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;Holly Wants to Go to California&quot; &quot;is the sort of social satire that Frank Zappa and the Mothers used to do so well.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; opined that &quot;the strongest material here—notably the first ten minutes or so of &#x27;(Not Just) Knee Deep&#x27;, with its snazzy synthesizer fills, razor-sharp Michael Hampton guitar solo, raucous vocals, and hook upon hook—is state-of-the-art black pop music.&quot;

Ned Raggett of AllMusic stated that the album starts &quot;out like a parody of patriotic recruitment ads before hitting its full, funky stride... It&#x27;s still very much a disco effort, but one overtly spiking the brew even more than before with P-Funk&#x27;s own particular recipe, mock drill instructors calling out dance commands and so forth.&quot;

<doc id="126012" wikidata="Q2151287" url="?curid=126012" title="Edgewood, New Mexico">
<text>Edgewood is a town in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, United States. Through annexations, its town boundaries now extend into Bernalillo and Torrance counties. Although in Santa Fe County, Edgewood is geographically closer to Albuquerque than to the city of Santa Fe. The town&#x27;s population grew 97% between 2000 and 2010, from 1,893 to 3,735.

== History ==
Homesteaders moving into the American West created the initial settlements that grew into what is now the town of Edgewood. Taking advantage of the federal Homestead Acts, pioneer families obtained land claims and began farming and ranching in the Edgewood area during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Edgewood was founded by a group of southern Santa Fe County residents and landowners. After the incorporation of the town in 1999, large areas of land were annexed. Efforts by the town government to avoid annexing properties whose owners did not wish to be brought within the town boundaries resulted in a checkerboard pattern of incorporated and unincorporated properties, one of the issues to be resolved in the town&#x27;s Comprehensive Plan. One controversial annexation greatly enlarged the municipal boundaries and was the source of vigorous public debate. Despite two appeals and one lawsuit, the annexation was upheld.

== Geography ==
Edgewood is located east of Albuquerque along Interstate 40.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land except for of water, covering 0.03% of the town.

==Prehistory==
Archaic Indians lived and hunted in the Eldorado area; archaeologists and others have found Clovis points, but little detailed information is available about these earliest settlers.

Around AD 600, Ancestral Pueblo (Anasazi) settlers established farms and small pueblos in the area. These settlements endured until about 1325, when a disastrous drought forced abandonment of what became the Eldorado area. Some inhabitants probably moved to the Galisteo, New Mexico area, which itself was abandoned about 1450, as were all of the nearby pueblos except Pecos.

Formal archaeological investigations began about 1914 when Nels C. Nelson of the American Museum of Natural History partially excavated Pueblo Alamo (site LA-8), near the present-day junction of I-25 with US-285. Unfortunately, Pueblo Alamo was almost completely destroyed by the construction of I-25 around 1971, although some salvage archaeology was done.

Another, smaller pueblo, Chamisa Locita or Pueblo Walls (site LA-4) remains largely undisturbed on undeveloped private land, but it has no formal protection.

==History==
Eldorado lies entirely within the Canada de los Alamos Grant, a Spanish land grant which dates back to 1785. In 1883, the entire grant was sold for US$2,000. As recorded in 1894, and patented by the US government, the size of the grant was about .

In 1901, the Onderdonk Land &amp; Cattle company bought both the Canada de los Alamos Grant and the adjacent Bishop John Lamy Grant for $10,000. The Lamy Grant was about when patented by the US in 1874. The Onderdonk Ranch operated both grants as a cattle ranch into the 1950s. The ranch was sold to the Simpson family in 1956, who continued to operate it until 1969, when the Simpsons sold the land to the American Realty and Petroleum Corporation (AMREP) for $3.2 million, or about $118.50/acre.

AMREP proceeded to develop about of their purchase as Eldorado at Santa Fe, selling the first lots in 1972. For the first ten years, development was slow—only about 200 houses were built. After 1983, when AMREP won a lawsuit over water rights, the pace of development quickened. Many passive solar houses were built, and Eldorado remains the largest solar community in the USA. AMREP platted about 2700 lots in the original Eldorado subdivisions. As of 2007, the original Eldorado subdivisions were mostly built-out, with only a few vacant lots on the market. There are large areas of vacant private land adjacent.

There are an additional 20 or so newer subdivisions along U.S. Route 285, locally called the 285 Corridor, between Eldorado at Santa Fe and Lamy. Most of these offer larger lots and more expensive houses than Eldorado. Most are served by the Eldorado community water utility. Informally, the adjacent subdivisions, such as Belicia, Dos Griegos and The Ridges, are also called &quot;Eldorado&quot;, but they have different covenants and no formal ties to the original AMREP subdivision.

==Education==
It is within Santa Fe Public Schools.

It is zoned to El Dorado Community School (K-8). Its high school is Santa Fe High School.

The Vista Grande Public Library is in Eldorado.

==Transportation==
The Santa Fe Southern Railway passes through the center of Eldorado, and excursion train rides are offered to Santa Fe. There have been proposals to offer a commuter train service. There is a bike/horse/walking trail alongside the railway that extends from the town of Lamy to the Railyard in Santa Fe.

The North Central Regional Transit District offers bus service between Eldorado and Santa Fe.

==Arts==
The Eldorado Arts and Crafts Association holds an annual studio tour each year, in mid-May. The 2010 tour featured 117 artists showing their work in 83 studios. On sale are traditional paintings, digital art, ceramics, textiles, wearable art, photography, sculpture, jewelry and more.

All artists contribute 5 percent of sale proceeds to the Eldorado Fire Department, Eldorado Elementary School, and the Vista Grande Public Library. In the past five years, the association has contributed about $15,000 to these organizations.
