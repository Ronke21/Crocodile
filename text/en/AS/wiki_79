==Southern Railway in Furman==

From 1899 until the 1980s, the Southern Railway operated a line through Furman and nearby Allendale, Tarboro, and Lena. Called the &quot;Southern Columbia to Savannah Route&quot;, the rail also ran through Barnwell and Blackville to the north. Its primary purpose was to increase north–south passenger and freight traffic by feeding into the Atlantic Coast Line at Hardeeville for passage south to Florida or north to Charleston and other points. The rail line was built to compete with another north–south rail line operated nearby by the Seaboard Air Line (also called the Florida Central &amp; Peninsular, Seaboard Coast Line, and presently CSX) which ran a different course through Denmark, Fairfax, Estill, and Garnett (parallel to US 321) and then into Georgia. Between 1963 and 1970, Southern abandoned its tracks between Furman and Hardeeville, leaving Furman as the ending station from Columbia. In the early 1980s, Southern abandoned its tracks south of Blackville, ending its rail service to Barnwell, Allendale, and Furman. However, by the 1970s, any rail service to Furman would have been a rare event.

Hampton County was created from northwestern portions of Beaufort County in 1878 by the South Carolina General Assembly. In appreciation for helping to end the Reconstruction Era and leading the Democratic Party, the county was named after the sitting governor, Wade Hampton III. Upon creation of the county, the town of Hampton Courthouse was incorporated the following year to serve as the county seat. The U.S. Postal Service would later shorten the name to Hampton. The location was chosen based on the midpoint location of the Port Royal Railroad between Augusta, Georgia, and Port Royal, in hopes to spur economic development. The town was laid out in an orderly grid pattern, with streets running northeast/southwest being named after trees and streets running northwest/southeast being numbered. The central three-block main street which ran between the courthouse block and the rail depot was named Lee Avenue.

Hampton prospered due to its connections with local agricultural fields and became an important depot along the railway. However, the town remained small, though an influx of activity occurred in World War II when a Prisoner-of-War camp was opened near the town. Additional economic development came in the form of industry, with Plywoods-Plastic opening a major facility northwest of town for pulp production. Over time, the company was acquired by Westinghouse and International Paper. IP sold the site to Nevamar, and the facility remained one of the county&#x27;s largest employers until its closure in late 2014.

In recent years, auto-oriented commercial development was focused on the outskirts of town, leaving the original downtown without much activity. The town of Hampton has attempted to bring back commercial and civic activity to Lee Avenue and has undergone a multi-phased streetscape project, which has rendered some success in luring back businesses to downtown. Hampton County also completed renovations to its historic courthouse in 2012, choosing to remain in downtown Hampton.

The American Legion Hut, Bank of Hampton, Hampton Colored School, Hampton County Courthouse, and Palmetto Theatre are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Briarcliffe Acres is a town in Horry County, South Carolina, United States, located between Myrtle Beach and North Myrtle Beach. The population was 457 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Briarcliffe Acres is located in southeastern Horry County at (33.789267, -78.747300). It is bordered to the north and east by the city of North Myrtle Beach. U.S. Route 17 forms the northern border of the town, leading northeast to the center of North Myrtle Beach and southwest to the center of Myrtle Beach.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Briarcliffe Acres was developed as a retirement community by Kenneth Ellsworth, a native of Briarcliff Manor, New York (from which he took the name of his project), who married Virginia (Ginny) Gasque (pronounced &quot;gas-kwee&quot; or, by some, &quot;gas-kee&quot;). Her family came from the nearby town of Conway, South Carolina. Briarcliffe was one of the first planned communities in the Southeast.

In the early (pre-1930) parts of the 20th century, the coastal areas of northernmost South Carolina were used mostly as farming sites. (The real estate monolith now known as Burroughs and Chapin for decades was named &quot;Myrtle Beach Farms&quot;.) Sea breezes washed nutrients on crops planted on sand dunes, much as now is done through roots in hydroponic gardens, and cotton and tobacco thrived; farmers from Loris, Galivants Ferry, Florence and other Lowcountry towns bought land on the coast for practical reasons and then spent summers with their families there, rather than stay in the hellish heat and sand fleas of their main farms.

As a result, a few people subsequently built vacation homes in the first resort area, Murrells Inlet, and, later, erected rooming houses north in what would become Myrtle Beach. One influential example was the Patricia Court (later Patricia Inn and now Patricia Grand Resort) started in the 1930s but reaching importance in the late 1940s, built by Patricia Rousseau of North Wilkesboro, North Carolina. Further north still, Ken and Ginny Ellsworth recognized that the idea of living at the beach for its own sake could be expanded into a community. They found a large tract of land owned by Elizabeth Patterson, a daughter of Simeon B. Chapin.

As soon as it was possible after acquiring the property, the Ellsworths dug a yacht basin on the adjacent Intracoastal Waterway, on the land side of US Highway 17. They built a small cottage between the highway and yacht basin so they could be close both to the wealthy people on the waterway and the potentially larger numbers of people driving down the main road from New York to Miami. (The idea of capitalizing on the highway also motivated Jack Nelson who built the El Rancho Motel, once featured in &quot;Life&quot; Magazine, about south.) Ken and Ginny cut roads, layered them with coquina (a local mix of sand and fossilized shells), and looked for residents.

Among the first people to move in were Ginny&#x27;s parents, who built a home on what is now North Gate Road, just on the edge of the brow above the drop-down to the beach, backing up to the huge lot owned by the Lewis family (who owned the northernmost fishing pier in the area). The location on the brow—like that of Patterson&#x27;s home, on the opposite end of the property—was intended to provide both easy access to the shore and protection from storms (a plan that has worked until the present day).

Next came the Sorry (pronounced &quot;Sow-ree&quot;; rhymes with &quot;Horry&quot;, as in the county) family, who built next to the Gasques. They were followed by the Dutch van Buren family (distant descendants of the American President), who discovered the place by anchoring one night in the yacht basin on a trip south and then visiting the land, deciding to build a home and retire, which proved the wisdom of Ken Ellsworth&#x27;s original scheme.

The van Burens told another Dutch family — Anton Frederik and Casperina Hermina Groeneveld Baarslag, friends of theirs from New York and Vermont — about the place, who visited and then moved down in 1950.

In 1951 Alfred Colby Hockings and his wife — he was a well-known illustrator for &quot;Field &amp; Stream&quot; magazine, originally from Wisconsin but most recently living in the artists&#x27; community of Tryon, North Carolina — built a home up the street from the Gasques and Sorrys and across from the Baarslags; at almost the same time another Dutch family — Gerbrand and Nellie Poster, the son-in-law and daughter of the Baarslags — came down from New York City to visit her parents for Christmas, decided to stay, and built a home next door to her parents. (Poster was later to found Coastal Federal Savings and Loan Association and use connections developed during his military service as a Dutch national in the US Army during World War II to help convince the US government to declare that the damage done by Hurricane Hazel in 1954 should be covered by insurance. This made possible the second renaissance of the community, the first having been its emergence from the Great Depression.)

At this time, all the homes in Briarcliffe—except for the van Burens, who lived across the road from the central lake, and Elizabeth Patterson, whose home was on what is now Middle Gate Road—were clustered along what is now North Gate Road. Two developments, one small and one huge, changed Briarcliffe in ways that remain to this day.

The first was the Poster family itself, which when moving in included a seven-year-old and a four-year-old and who were soon joined by a newborn. This changed the tenor of Briarcliffe by moving it from a retirement community to a third (less-expensive) alternative to the Pine Lakes and Dunes sections, all of which offered a place to rear a family close to, but not in, the increasing tawdriness of Myrtle Beach itself.

The second was the financial impact of the government&#x27;s intervention with the insurance companies after Hurricane Hazel. The companies had wanted to declare the damage &quot;high water&quot;, which was not covered; Poster convinced the authorities that the damage had been caused by &quot;wind-driven water&quot;, which was covered. This changed the whole of Myrtle Beach, as payment of claims allowed small rooming houses to be replaced by motels. This impacted the whole of coastal South Carolina, including Briarcliffe.

At the same time, the United States Air Force had decided to deal with the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base by treating it as a sort of reward to which people could be assigned if they deserved a vacation, or a punishment for those whose careers were at an end.

Many people in both groups chose Briarcliffe as a place in which to build or buy, ranging from Air Force heroes (such as Col. Francis [&quot;Gabby&quot;] Gabreski, the first pilot to be an &quot;ace&quot; in two wars) to investors, artists and simple families. The boom in Myrtle Beach led to a boom in Briarcliffe, and soon a community once associated with raccoons and deer became a residential destination.

Among the significant people in this new wave must be remembered Rolf Bierens, another Dutchman who—having retired from General Motors thanks to his involvement in the design of their automatic transmission—first built his home with his own hands and then the first cabana. Increasingly, other residents brought histories, such as the then-industrialist Krampf, button-manufacturer Schwanda and developer Passow.

Briarcliffe Acres is still a place of lakes, pine and scrub-oak forests and wild animals. Although the surrounding Grand Strand area has changed and been developed, Briarcliffe Acres remains much like it was in the 1960s.

Buck used his ships to transport lumber to Georgetown and Charleston in South Carolina and as far away as New York City and Boston, and even to other countries. Lumber from Buck&#x27;s operation even went into the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge.

<text>Conway is a city in and the county seat of Horry County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 24,849 at the 2020 census, up from 17,103 in the 2010 census, making it the 18th-most populous city in the state. The city is part of the Myrtle Beach metropolitan area. It is the home of Coastal Carolina University.

Numerous buildings and structures located in Conway are on the National Register of Historic Places. Among these is the City Hall building, designed by Robert Mills, architect of the Washington Monument. Since the completion of the Main Street USA project in the 1980s, Conway&#x27;s downtown has been revitalized with shops and bistros. Highlighting the renovation of the downtown area is the Riverwalk, an area of restaurants which follows a stretch of the Waccamaw River that winds through Conway.

==History==
Conway is one of the oldest towns in South Carolina. Early English colonists named the village &quot;Kings Town&quot; but soon changed it to &quot;Kingston&quot;. The town was founded in 1732 as part of Royal Governor Robert Johnson&#x27;s Township Scheme. It was laid out on a bluff overlooking the Waccamaw River in what is now known as Horry County.

For three decades, from the 1730s to the 1750s, King George II was very popular in the area. The King&#x27;s birthday was one of the most widely celebrated holidays during that time. However, his successor King George III quickly grew unpopular with the townspeople. By the 1770s, the region of South Carolina in which Kingston was located was overwhelmingly English, though there were also small numbers of Huguenots and Scots-Irish people. English-Americans in Kingston were very sympathetic to rebels in Charleston over the issue of taxation without representation. When the Royal Governor Lord William Campbell fled Charleston, the people of Kingston celebrated.

Many area residents fought in the American Revolution, and small engagements were fought near Kingston at Bear Bluff and at Black Lake. Francis Marion, who was known as the &quot;Swamp Fox&quot;, had an encampment near Kingston just across the Waccamaw River. The areas of Kingston and Charles Town were communities with a higher population of Tories than many other Colonial American towns during the Revolutionary War era.

Horry County was created in 1801, and its courthouse was established in Kingston. The name &quot;Kingston&quot; was later changed to &quot;Conwayborough&quot;, to honor local hero General Robert Conway. In 1883, the South Carolina General Assembly changed the name of the town to &quot;Conway&quot;.

During the 21 years that South Carolina had legalized video poker, Little River&#x27;s location near the North Carolina state line made the community a major center for the activity. In 1996, local churches began protesting legalized gambling in what had become Little Reno, and the state outlawed the games in 2000. Two years before the video poker ban, casino boats began operating and continue to do so in federal waters because the state has not specifically banned them. Little River has the state&#x27;s only casino boat, The Big M Casino.

<doc id="134534" wikidata="Q839805" url="?curid=134534" title="Myrtle Beach, South Carolina">
<text>Myrtle Beach is a resort city on the East Coast of the United States in Horry County, South Carolina. It is located in the center of a long and continuous stretch of beach known as the &quot;Grand Strand” in the northeastern part of the state. Its year-round population was 35,682 as of the 2020 census, making it the 13th-most populous city in South Carolina.

Myrtle Beach is one of the major centers of tourism in South Carolina and the United States. The city&#x27;s warm subtropical climate, miles of beaches, 86 golf courses, and 1,800 restaurants attract over 20 million visitors each year, making Myrtle Beach one of the most visited destinations in the country.

Located along the historic King&#x27;s Highway (modern day U.S. Route 17), the region was once home to the Waccamaw people. During the colonial period, the Whither family settled in the area, and a prominent local waterway, Wither&#x27;s Swash, is named in their honor. Originally called alternately &quot;New Town&quot; or &quot;Withers&quot;, the area was targeted for development as a resort community by Franklin Burroughs, whose sons completed a railroad to the beach and the first inn, Seaside Inn. His widow named the new community Myrtle Beach after the local wax-myrtle shrubs.

The Myrtle Beach metropolitan area is one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the country, with an estimated population of 397,478 in 2023. More than 104,000 people moved to the area over eight years, representing a nearly 28% growth in population.

==History==


Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the Long Bay area was inhabited by the historic Waccamaw tribe. The Waccamaw used the river for travel and fished along the shore around Little River. Waties Island, the primary barrier island along Long Bay, has evidence of burial and shell mounds, remains of the visiting Waccamaw.

The first European settlers along Long Bay arrived in the late 18th century, attempting to extend the plantation system outward toward the ocean. Records are sparse from this period, with most of the recorded history pieced together from English colonial land grant documents. These settlers gained mixed results, producing unremarkable quantities of indigo and tobacco, the two major commodity crops. The coast&#x27;s soil was sandy and most of the crop yields were of inferior quality.

Prior to the American Revolution, the area along the future Grand Strand was essentially uninhabited. Several families received land grants along the coast, including the Witherses: John, Richard, William, and Mary. This family received an area around present-day Wither&#x27;s Swash, also known as Myrtle Swash or the Eight-Mile Swash. A separate grant was granted to James Minor, including a barrier island named Minor Island, now Waties Island, off the coast near Little River.

Mary Withers&#x27;s gravestone at Prince George Winyah Parish Church speaks to the remoteness of the former Strand: &quot;She gave up the pleasures of Society and retired to Long Bay, where she resided a great part of her life devoted to the welfare of her children.&quot;

As the American colonies gained independence, the area remained essentially unchanged, and the coast remained barren. George Washington scouted out the Southern states during his term, traveling down the King&#x27;s Highway. He stayed a night at Windy Hill (part of present-day North Myrtle Beach) and was led across Wither&#x27;s Swash to Georgetown by Jeremiah Vereen.

The Withers family remained one of the few settlers around Myrtle Beach for the next half-century. In 1822, a strong hurricane swept the house of R. F. Withers into the ocean, drowning 18 people inside. The tragedy made the Withers family decide to abandon their plots along the coast. Left unattended, the area began to return to forest.

The Burroughs and Collins Company of Conway, predecessor of modern-day Burroughs &amp; Chapin, purchased much of the Withers family&#x27;s land in 1881. The growing community was called &quot;New Town&quot; around the start of the 20th century. A post office named &quot;Withers&quot; was established to serve the site of the old Swash in 1888. On 28 February 1899, Burroughs and Collins received a charter to build the Conway &amp; Seashore Railroad to transport timber from the coast to inland customers. The railroad began daily service on 1 May 1900, with two wood-burning locomotives. One of the engines was dubbed &quot;The Black Maria&quot; and came second-hand from a North Carolina logging operation.

After the railroad was finished, employees of the lumber and railroad company would take train flatcars down to the beach area on their free weekends, becoming the first Grand Strand tourists. The railroad terminus was nicknamed &quot;New Town&quot;, contrasting it with the &quot;Old Town&quot;, or Conway.

Around the start of the 20th century, Franklin Burroughs envisioned turning New Town into a tourist destination rivaling the Florida and northeastern beaches. Burroughs died in 1897, but his sons completed the railroad&#x27;s expansion to the beach and opened the Seaside Inn in 1901.

Around 1900, a contest was held to name the area, and Burroughs&#x27;s wife suggested honoring the locally abundant shrub, the southern wax myrtle (&quot;Myrica cerifera&quot;). The Withers post office changed its name to &quot;Myrtle Beach&quot; soon afterward. It incorporated as a town in 1938 and as a city in 1957.

In 1937, Myrtle Beach Municipal Airport was built. It was taken over by the United States Army Air Corps in 1940 and converted into a military base. Commercial flights began in 1976 and shared the runway for over 15 years until the air base closed in 1993. Since then the airport has been named Myrtle Beach International Airport. In 2010 plans to build a new terminal were approved. In 1940, Kings Highway was finally paved, giving Myrtle Beach its first primary highway.

The Myrtle Heights-Oak Park Historic District, Myrtle Beach Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Station, Ocean Forest Country Club and Pleasant Inn are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Also listed were the Chesterfield Inn, Rainbow Court and the Myrtle Beach Pavilion, all now demolished. The Gay Dolphin Gift Cove on the Boardwalk was built in 1946 and sells seashells and Myrtle Beach souvenirs. It claims to be the &quot;nation&#x27;s largest gift shop&quot;.

==Geography==

Myrtle Beach has been separated from the continental United States since 1936 by the Intracoastal Waterway, forcing the city and area in general to develop within a small distance from the coast. In part due to this separation, the area directly northwest of Myrtle Beach, across the waterway, remained primarily rural for a while, whereas its northeastern and southwestern ends were bordered by other developed tourist towns, North Myrtle Beach and Surfside Beach. Since then, the inland portion of the Myrtle Beach area has developed dramatically.

Myrtle Beach is by highway southeast of Florence, South Carolina, northeast of Charleston, South Carolina, and southwest of Wilmington, North Carolina.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (1.14%) is water.

=====Motorcycle rallies=====

Myrtle Beach Bike Week, also called &quot;Harley Bike Week&quot;, is a week-long motorcycle rally first held in 1940, the same year Kings Highway was paved. The event has attracted as many as 200,000 visitors to the city every May. Black Bike Week, founded in 1980, takes place the weekend around Memorial Day Weekend and is the largest African American motorcycle rally in the US and attracts as many as 400,000 visitors. The event was created in response to a history of discrimination against African-American visitors and riders to Myrtle Beach and the Grand Strand Area.

The Myrtle Beach government created 15 new laws aimed at preventing all sanctioned motorcycle events within the city in response to controversy including accusations of racism by African-American riders during their event and complaints of lawlessness and poor behavior during all highly attended events. Several lawsuits by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) against Myrtle Beach businesses were settled with agreements that discrimination cease, compensation be given to some plaintiffs, and employees be given diversity training. The NAACP suit against the City of Myrtle Beach was settled in 2006 without the city paying damages, but with the agreement police would use the same traffic control rules during both the black and the white motorcycle rallies.

The South Carolina Supreme Court in June 2010 unanimously overturned one of the 15 ordinances, which had required all motorcyclists to wear helmets, on the grounds that the state law, requiring helmets only for riders under age 21, cannot be preempted by a city ordinance. In addition, the Court ruled that the ordinance created undue confusion, and that the city itself had invalidated their own helmet law and some other ordinances in a subsequent amendment. The law had been challenged by a group of motorcyclists and a group of Myrtle Beach businesses called BOOST, Business Owners Organized to Support Tourism, who opposed the city&#x27;s anti-motorcycle tourism policy.

====Rail====
The Waccamaw Coast Line Railroad is a short-line railroad division of the Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad, extending from a connection with the Carolina Southern Railroad, another division of that company, at Conway to Myrtle Beach. The line was opened in 1900 by the Conway Coast and Western Railroad, a predecessor of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. The Seaboard System Railroad sold the line to Horry County in November 1985, and it was operated by the Horry County Railway until October 1987, when the WCLR took over. The Carolina Southern Railroad acquired the WCLR in September 1995, and since then it has been a division of the Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad. Horry County owns the line but leased it to the Carolina Southern Railroad in 2000.

Carolina Southern Railroad is a short line rail operator running on less than of rail at a maximum speed of . It transports mostly freight brought to it from national rail operators. The company makes one scheduled delivery per month into the City of Myrtle Beach. It is off of Main Street in Conway, South Carolina, and is one of the few remaining train depots in South Carolina. It has been painstakingly restored to its former glory and the Carolina Southern Railroad has become one of the frequent destinations for freight services as well as passenger cars and observational locomotives. The railroad was originally erected in late 1886 and the first train steamed into the Conway Depot in December 1887.

The Carolina Southern Railroad stands as a permanent landmark in Southern History. Carolina Southern Railroad is a member of the Carolina Rails system with connections that run from Whiteville, North Carolina, to Mullins, South Carolina, and also from Chadbourn, North Carolina, to Conway. Carolina Southern railroad is also responsible for operation of the Waccamaw Coast Line Railroad, which is a railway that runs from Conway to Myrtle Beach.

On August 30, 2011, Carolina Southern Railroad voluntary shut down because several bridges along the rail were overdue for maintenance. The shutdown caused Carolina Southern Railroad to lay off nearly all of its employees. On May 24, 2012, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) commenced a bridge inspection on the CSR and the Waccamaw Coastline Railroad (the Horry County portion of rail). Fifty-two of 187 bridges were inspected and seven had critical defects. On May 26, 2011, the CSR voluntarily ceased operation, so that they could bring in a certified bridge engineer to inspect the seven critical bridges and prepare a plan for their repairs. Based on the engineer&#x27;s recommendations, CSR made the necessary repairs on the bridges and CSR resumed operations August 8, 2011. The FRA returned to inspect the bridges and made a recommendation that CSR cease operations until all bridge repairs were completed. There are efforts to bring the railroad back online.

In 2015, railroad operator RJ Corman acquired the former CSR line and re-opened it freight service in early April 2016.
Until 1955 the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad ran passenger rail service from the Myrtle Beach Station to Chadbourn, where a connection could be made to interstate ACL train service.

====Roads====
* 
* 
* 
* Farrow Parkway
* Grissom Parkway

Most of these roads follow the Metro Loop Road Plan, organized in 1997 to improve the traffic flow of Myrtle Beach. Some of the roads included have either been funded through Road Improvement Development Effort (RIDE I) funding or through the City of Myrtle Beach.

RIDE II plans include the third phase of S.C. Highway 31, a graded separation of Farrow Parkway and US 17 Bypass at the back gate of the former Air Force base, and many other projects. The county is debating where to allocate the $400 million generated through a proposed 1-cent sales tax. Other road projects in Horry County, including some in Aynor and Conway, will be included when voted upon.

<text>Surfside Beach is a town in Horry County, South Carolina, United States. Its nickname is &quot;The Family Beach&quot;. The population was 3,837 at the 2010 census, down from 4,425 in 2000. It is considered a part of the Grand Strand.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau Surfside Beach has a total area of 2.1 square miles (5.1 km2), of which 1.9 square miles (5.0 km2) is land and 0.04 square mile (0.1 km2) (1.02%) is water.

==History==

===Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries===

In the early nineteenth century, there is evidence of a slave plantation of 3,200 acres (1838) at what is now Surfside Beach. There are traveller accounts from the eighteenth century of the area. The 1765 diary of John Bartram, botanist, shows him lodging at what was probably Stephen Peak&#x27;s slave plantation, &quot;at the west end of long bay&quot;. In 1773, William Bartram, naturalist, also &quot;got to the West end of Long Bay, where [he] lodged at a large Indigo plantation&quot;. The plantation in question was called &quot;The Ark&quot;, a name for which the first record is in 1867; it may have originally been owned by &quot;Mr. Aark&quot;. In 1820 it was owned by John Tillman. The 1838 survey recorded it having 3,194 acres. The plantation reported 57 enslaved people in 1850 and 63 in 1860. In 1850 the crops were sweet potatoes and rice. Other farmed animals and crops are thought to have included cattle, sheep, pigs, Indian corn and peas.

The main house was near the ocean front (at 3rd Ave South and Willow Drive in present-day Surfside Beach), with several buildings for slave quarters to the north along the ocean and a cemetery behind it (South Hollywood Dr on the west, to Juniper Drive on the north, to 6th Ave South on the east, to Cypress Drive on the south). The main house had four large rooms and was made of timber; it was used as shelter during a hurricane in 1893.

===Twentieth century===
The main house became a hotel, and then a shelter for lifeguards, before it was demolished in the 1960s. The cemetery, where many of the enslaved people of the plantation were buried, continued to be used by descendants of those families until the 1950s. In 1980, the town of Surfside Beach declared it abandoned, opening the area for development. There are now houses on the site, which have destroyed most of the cemetery, though some graves are still visible, and in 2022 markers and memorials were put up.

Surfside Beach was previously known as Roach&#x27;s Beach and had only a few buildings surviving the hurricane of 1893. Principal industries were lumber and feed farming for the 30 or so horses and mules in the area. The new owner, George J. Holiday of Galivants Ferry, renamed the area Floral Beach after his wife, Flora. He built a sawmill and opened a hotel in the old house of the plantation, the Tillman house.

Holiday sold the land to a group from Columbia who partially developed the land. In 1952, most of the land changed hands again and became known as Surfside Beach. A pier was built in 1953.

Hurricane Hazel in 1954 destroyed most of the beach&#x27;s seventy houses and the pier. In 1976 the Department of Housing and Urban Development noted that the town &quot;is subject to serious flooding from tidal surge caused by hurricanes and tidal storms&quot;; there had been significant storms or hurricanes in 1872, 1874, 1883, 1893, 1894, 1899, 1906, and 1944, as well as Hurricane Hazel, and no flood defenses were in place or planned. Development plans continued. By 1956 there were six families living permanently on the beach, with others coming on holiday. The settlement expanded after the reactivation of Myrtle Beach Air Force Base in 1956. The town was incorporated in 1964. It had 881 residents at that point. Municipal annexation led to growth of the settlement.

===Twenty-first century===

Surfside Beach adopted a public-places smoking ban which took effect October 1, 2007. Surfside Beach is the first town in Horry County to enact such a ban, and one of only a handful in South Carolina to do so at the time.

On February 4, 2023, at 2:39 PM local time, a Chinese spy balloon that had been flying across the United States for days was shot down directly over the town&#x27;s coast by an AIM-9X Sidewinder launched from a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. US military aircraft were spotted directly overhead of the town minutes before the balloon was shot down.

<doc id="134539" wikidata="Q2122398" url="?curid=134539" title="Hardeeville, South Carolina">
<text>Hardeeville is a city in Jasper and Beaufort counties in the U.S. state of South Carolina. The population was 7,473 as of the 2020 census, an increase of over 150% since 2010. Hardeeville is included within the Hilton Head Island–Bluffton metropolitan area.

For many years, Hardeeville billed itself as the &quot;Lowcountry Host&quot; due to the prevalence of lodging and traveler-oriented facilities along U.S. Highway 17 and later Interstate 95. In recent years, the city has expanded its economic focus due to high population growth. According to Census estimates, Hardeeville posted the highest population growth rate of any municipality in South Carolina, growing 53.4 percent from 2010 to 2014.

==History==

The earliest European settlement in the region was Purrysburg, a former Swiss Huguenot settlement founded in 1732 on the banks of the Savannah River, about northwest of the current city&#x27;s center. The settlement ultimately failed, as disease and competition from growing Savannah proved too much for the local settlers to overcome. Many left the immediate area, moving elsewhere in the Lowcountry region (including a new hamlet called Switzerland) or upriver to the new communities of Augusta, Georgia, and Hamburg, South Carolina, though some remained.

The area saw some skirmishes between Union and Confederate forces during the Civil War. The Charleston and Savannah Railway (today&#x27;s CSX Transportation) was considered a prized possession and major strategic goal for Union forces. The Battle of Honey Hill, an effort to defend the railroad, was one of the later battles won by Southern forces in late 1864, shortly before General William Sherman entered South Carolina after his March to the Sea in Georgia.
The area within the city was settled in the 19th century by Isaac Hardee, a native from North Carolina. Through the efforts of his son, Whyte William Hardee, a depot and general store along the Charleston and Savannah Railway opened up. This depot and the surrounding areas became collectively known as &quot;Hardee&#x27;s Station&quot;, and eventually as &quot;Hardeeville&quot; at the town&#x27;s founding in 1911. The area became renowned for its timber operations with the Argent Lumber Company, which had one of the largest logging operations in the world. Unique to the area was the swamp logging procedure, with conditions that were far more treacherous than standard logging. narrow-gauge railroads were constructed to help deliver timber to a processing area, where the lumber would be lifted onto rail cars or trucks headed to all parts of North America. As a tribute to Argent&#x27;s impact on the community, the city was donated an H.K. Porter 2-8-0 steam locomotive (c/n 4776, built January 1911), Argent Lumber Company Number 7, for display in 1960.

Growth continued at a modest pace throughout the rest of the 20th century, though timbering operations were gradually scaled back as overseas lands became more sought after due to lower costs and more standard logging procedures. In spite of the decline of the logging industry, the construction of U.S. Route 17 and later Interstate 95 provided a new type of commerce: motorist services such as motels, restaurants, and gas stations. The development of Hilton Head Island to the southeast as a resort destination had a further impact on the community, with an additional interstate exit providing greater commercial opportunity and affordable costs of living for service employees who moved to the city.

At the start of the 21st century, development pressures along the U.S. Route 278 corridor became a central concern for city leaders. In response, Hardeeville began to annex large undeveloped parcels of land that were previously held by timbering and paper concerns. These annexations were done in order to guide new growth into larger planned developments, increasing the city limits from in 2000 to over in 2010. In 2004, Core Communities became the first company to sign a development agreement with the city and began constructing Tradition Hilton Head. In the following years, other developments have begun or announced plans at developing in these areas. Although the recession beginning in late 2007 significantly slowed the pace of development, the city has continued to grow due to continuous commitments from existing developers, and new investment related to industrial and commercial opportunities. These investments have allowed the city to make improvements to its existing areas in the form of streetscaping projects, improved community facilities, and general reinvestment.

Most of Hardeeville is located within Jasper County, though a small portion of the city crosses into Beaufort County. Much of the city is bordered to the west by the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge, a large-scale nature preserve along the South Carolina and Georgia sides of the Savannah River.

==Neighborhoods==
Although a small community in terms of population, Hardeeville is among the 10 largest municipalities in South Carolina based on incorporated limits. The city has a small downtown area along with newly developing areas primarily along the U.S. 278 corridor. At the present time, there are two distinct population centers: Downtown and New River.

&quot;Downtown&quot; or &quot;Historic Hardeeville&quot; refers generally to the original city limit extents of the community, bound between Exits 5 and 8 along I-95 and between the interstate and the CSX rail line. Downtown consists mostly of one-story single-family homes and one- to two-story apartments. Main Street (S.C. 46) and Whyte Hardee Boulevard (U.S. 17) provide the majority of commercial development in downtown. Locally oriented commerce is located along Main Street and northern portions of Whyte Hardee Boulevard. Nearby neighborhoods often associated with downtown include Car Moorer Acres, Pine Arbor, Heritage Place, Jenny Greeene, and Deerfield Village.

The &quot;New River&quot; area of Hardeeville contains large-scale planned developments along the U.S. 278 and Argent Boulevard corridors. A vast majority of population growth since 2005 has been attributed to these developments, which were annexed into the city between 2004 and 2010. These developments include Hilton Head Lakes, Hampton Pointe (rebranded 2021 to Riverton Pointe,) Hearthstone Lakes, Latitude Margaritaville and Jasper County portions of Sun City Hilton Head. Additional neighborhoods include the Courtney Bend apartments and Camp Lake Jasper, an RV park.

Downtown Hardeeville has traditionally been the center of commercial activity in the city, with traveler services along U.S. 17 mixing together with more local-oriented businesses along Main Street. Hardeeville&#x27;s two exits along Interstate 95 are some of South Carolina&#x27;s more popular stopping points, with traveler-oriented commercial services. Although Exit 5 has been in existence longer and has more commercial activity, Exit 8 has experienced recent commercial growth as well. Exit 8 also is the access point to the local hospital and a popular county park located within of the exit.

Among industrial and business park locations, the Hardeeville Industrial Park is among the most successful locations in the city, connected both to road and rail networks. Additional light industrial development is occurring in other areas of the city, especially along the Argent Boulevard and Highway 170 corridors.

In addition to existing industrial locations, the proposed RiverPort development on the western and southern edges of the city intends to focus on logistics, transportation, and port-related industrial uses along the U.S. Highway 17 corridor. A future Exit 3 along Interstate 95 is planned to facilitate industrial development in RiverPort and alleviate truck congestion through downtown Hardeeville.

==History==

=== Colonial years ===
Camden is the oldest inland city and the fourth oldest city in South Carolina. It is near the center of the Cofitachequi chiefdom that existed in the 1500s. In 1730, Camden became part of a township plan ordered by King George II. Kershaw County&#x27;s official website states, &quot;Originally laid out in 1732 as the town of Fredericksburg in the Wateree River swamp (south of the present town) when King George II ordered eleven inland townships established along South Carolina&#x27;s rivers, few of the area settlers chose to take lots surveyed in the town, choosing the higher ground to the north. The township soon disappeared.&quot; In 1758, Joseph Kershaw from Yorkshire, England, came into the township, established a store, and renamed the town &quot;Pine Tree Hill&quot;. Camden became the main inland trade center in the colony. Kershaw suggested that the town be renamed Camden, in honor of Lord Camden, a champion of colonial rights in the British Parliament. In the 1770s it was the site of an early American porcelain factory, established by John Bartlam.

=== American Revolution and antebellum era ===

May 1780 brought the American Revolution to Charleston, South Carolina, when it fell under the Crown&#x27;s control. Lord Charles Cornwallis and 2,500 of his Loyalist and British troops marched to Camden and established there the main British supply post for the Southern campaign. The Battle of Camden, the worst American defeat of the Revolution, was fought on August 16, 1780, near Camden, and on April 25, 1781, the Battle of Hobkirk&#x27;s Hill was fought between about 1,400 troops led by General Nathanael Greene and 950 Loyalists and British soldiers led by Lord Francis Rawdon. The latter battle was a costly win for the British and forced them to leave Camden and retreat to the coast. 

After the Revolution, Camden&#x27;s prominence and wealth grew as a major interior trading town with direct ties to Charleston and the world. Regional products, augmented with goods from the interior of North Carolina and far lands to the west were transported from Camden to Charleston on flat-bottom riverboats that plied the adjacent Wateree River before the railroad arrived in 1842. An Episcopal seminary opened in the town in 1857, but the campus burned during Sherman&#x27;s invasion. The school did not reopen.

=== American Civil War and later years ===
Camden was the source of six Confederate generals during the American Civil War. Richard Rowland Kirkland – &quot;The Angel of Marye&#x27;s Heights&quot; – is interred in the Old Quaker Cemetery. At the end of the war, components of Sherman&#x27;s army burned Confederate and nearby properties, including a full block of downtown buildings. The last Federal officer killed in the Civil War was 1st Lt E.L. Stevens of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry who died in a skirmish 9 miles south of Camden at the Battle of Boykin&#x27;s Mill on April 18, 1865.

Starting in the mid-1880s the Camden area became an increasingly popular destination for wealthy northern families to spend the winter. Eventually, three resort hotels provided winter tourism activities well into the 1930s and beyond. The town became associated with many equestrian activities and is now the home of the third oldest active polo field in America. In the winter, more than 1,500 thoroughbreds call the area home. According to Kershaw County&#x27;s web site, &quot;Horse-related activities became very popular. That interest in equine activities has continued and today the horse industry is a major part of the county&#x27;s economy. For that reason, the city is known as the &#x27;Steeplechase Capital of the World&#x27;.&quot;

In 1950, Dupont opened the Dupont May Plant in Camden which manufactured Orlon. The plant was located on five miles of land and employed over 2,000 people. For many years it was the town&#x27;s largest employer. In 1977, DuPont notified the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of a study the company conducted which showed an &quot;excessive incidence and cancer mortality&quot; rate among a cohort of workers who worked at the plant from 1950 to 1955. The findings were liked to a major chemical component of Orlon, acrylonitrile. Citing issues with foreign competition, Dupont ended the production of Orlon in 1990. Since the closure of the Orlon plant, the town has attracted a number of manufacturing companies such as Hengst GmbH &amp; Co. and Haier. In 2003, Target opened an $85 million distribution center in the town.
===Jewish community===
Camden has long had a Jewish community. Members of the community have included David Camden de Leon, Mordecai M. Levy, Chapman Levy, and Bernard Baruch.

<doc id="134543" wikidata="Q2252941" url="?curid=134543" title="Elgin, Kershaw County, South Carolina">
<text>Elgin is an incorporated town in Kershaw County, South Carolina, United States. Some portions of the town are in adjacent Richland County, South Carolina. It is located approximately northeast of the center of Columbia, the state&#x27;s capital, and is the center of one of the ten townships that make up Kershaw County. As of the 2010 census, the town&#x27;s population was 1,311, and in 2018 the estimated population was 1,579. It is part of the Columbia, South Carolina Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Elgin is located in southwestern Kershaw County at (34.169773, -80.791782), along U.S. Route 1, which leads southwest to Columbia and northeast to Camden, the county seat. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

Elgin lies within the Carolina Sandhills region of the Atlantic Coastal Plain province. This region is characterized by many dunes of wind-blown sand that were active during the last ice age (when conditions were colder, drier, and windier) but the dunes are currently stabilized by vegetation under modern climate conditions.

In late 2021 and 2022, southeastern Kershaw County experienced over 40 earthquakes, 11 of which exceeded a 2.5 magnitude. 6 of the quakes exceeded a 3.0 magnitude, the largest of which registering at a 3.6.

===Climate===

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Elgin has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded in Elgin was on June 30, 2012, while the coldest temperature recorded was on January 21, 1985.

== White Pond ==
White Pond is a local landmark in Elgin, consisting of a Sandhills dune formation and 66 acre natural lake. It was formed by the blocking of downstream drainage and wind blown sand during or prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. It is located on the western edge of the Atlantic Plain, and is host to flora typical of inland sand dunes such as the longleaf pine, British Soldier&#x27;s Lichen and the toxic flowering twine Gelsemium sempervirens.

White Pond has recently attracted scientific and media attention as having preserved a relatively long record of sediment accumulation in the pond. Several scientists have taken various core samples from White Pond that has revealed information on temperatures of non-glaciated areas during the Ice Age and information on plant and animal life in the area during the past. One dune on the south side of White Pond has yielded a luminescence date of ~92,300 years before present (BP). Platinum anomalies have recently been reported at the site at an age that would provide potential evidence for the controversial Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. However, the claim that these anomalies correspond to the Younger Dryas onset has been comprehensively refuted by other researchers 

White Pond is a noted landmark on architect Robert Mills&#x27; map of Kershaw County in 1825. There is a log cabin on the site, which hosts a local private fishing &amp; game club, and the lake is regularly stocked with trout. Archaeological investigation has occurred every year at the site since 2015, led Dr. Christopher Moore, in partnership with the USC Educational Foundation, Archaeological Consultants of the Carolinas Inc, South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, and several local volunteers. In 2017, excavations at White Pond revealed the presence of several layers of archaeological interest, including a Late Paleoindian Dalton occupation. People from the Clovis culture are thought to have resided in the area starting at least 12,500 years ago. Excavations in 2019 yielded an Edgefield scraper and Kirk Notched point, artifacts dating to the early Archaic period.

==History==
Elgin, previously named &quot;Blaney&quot;, and originally &quot;Jeffers&quot;, traces its European-American history to a post office established in the area in 1898. The small community that the post office served adopted the name Jeffers after its first postmaster, William T. Jeffers. The community did not see much growth until the Seaboard Air Line Railroad began expansion in the area in 1900. Development occurred near the railroad depot and post office. Seaboard agents, in an effort to increase use of the rail line, promoted business all along its route, including Jeffers. The town, and post office, was eventually renamed Blaney in honor of a New York banker who helped fund the railroad expansion in the region. The town of Blaney was officially chartered and incorporated on January 23, 1907.

Blaney&#x27;s first postmaster, Jesse T. Ross (who served for forty-seven years), was the first man to open a business, together with D. D. Evans. A brick schoolhouse was erected in 1912. Very little growth was seen in the town during the next 15 years; the &quot;Camden Chronicle&quot; said in 1927: &quot;I don&#x27;t think there were fifty people in [Blaney], in fact you wouldn&#x27;t know it was a town.&quot; However, by 1930, Blaney had built its own high school. In 1931 U.S. Highway 1 was completed. A fully paved road extending along the length of the eastern seaboard, it ran parallel to the already established rail line as it cut through Blaney. This offered a new route to bring in tourism and business to the area. It is still the main route into the town today.

In the late 1950s, postwar industrial development took place throughout the West Wateree Area along U.S. Highway 1. In 1958 a deal was closed with the Whitehead Brothers Sand Company, which opened up a $300,000 sand foundry between Lugoff and Blaney. State Senator John West recruited the Elgin National Watch Company in 1962 to relocate to the area. The company was attracted to the unused land and potential labor market to be recruited from nearby Columbia. Residents voted to change the town&#x27;s name from Blaney to Elgin in a landslide 61–16 vote. In September 1962, plans were confirmed to build a $1 million assembly plant in the town. The plant offered 240 jobs and received over a thousand applications when the hiring process started.

Due to the new plant, the town upgraded the area&#x27;s water supply system. By 1963, Elgin was drilling wells as part of a new $150,000 water system, and the plant had begun production. In 1967, officials from the Elgin National Watch Company announced that the plant would be sold to B. F. Goodrich, a manufacturer of tennis shoes, due to the company&#x27;s inability to compete with foreign-made products. That year, the Hardwicke Chemical Company broke ground at a 15-acre site near Elgin.

Elgin&#x27;s growth has continued in recent years. In 2005, a new sewer system was completed for the town and a new municipal complex was finished to house the town hall, police department, and fire station. The town grew by over 50% between the 2000 and 2010 census, going from 806 to 1311 residents with continued growth expected in the future. Elgin&#x27;s current mayor is Melissa Emmons.

<text>Clinton is a city in Laurens County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 8,490 as of the 2010 census. It is part of the Greenville–Mauldin–Easley Metropolitan Statistical Area in upstate South Carolina. Clinton is the home of Presbyterian College.

==History==
The Cherokee Indians were Clinton&#x27;s original inhabitants. The first settler to inhabit the area was John Duncan, a native of Aberdeen, Scotland, who arrived in 1752 from Pennsylvania and settled along a creek between the present-day towns of Clinton and Whitmire.

Scots-Irish immigrants from Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia became the predominant settlers in the area in the two decades before the American Revolutionary War and took active part in a Revolutionary War battle in 1780 at nearby Musgrove Mill.

As late as 1852, the town was called Five Points because it arose at the intersection of four major roads and the railroad. It was named Clinton after Henry Clinton Young, a lawyer from the county seat of Laurens, who planned the first roads in the area.

As the railroad began to grow, so did the town, and more plots of land were developed around the railroad. With the population&#x27;s growth came the establishment of the First Presbyterian Church in 1855.

In 1895, &quot;factory fever&quot; had struck the town of Clinton. This came with the establishment of the Clinton Cotton Mill in 1896 by Mercer Silas Bailey, owner of the town&#x27;s leading dry goods store. Lydia Cotton Mill, also owned by the Baileys and their descendants, followed in 1902. In 1933 there is a documented case of the lynching of Norris Dendy, a 33-year-old African-American man, in Clinton after he was arrested for striking a white man.

The mills continued to be a vital source of prosperity for Clinton until their closure in 2001 brought years of economic hardship from which the area is still struggling to emerge.

The Clinton Commercial Historic District, Duncan&#x27;s Creek Presbyterian Church, and Thornwell-Presbyterian College Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Clinton is located at (34.471257, -81.875023). The city is concentrated around the intersection of U.S. Route 76 and South Carolina Highway 72, south of Spartanburg and northwest of Columbia.

<text>Laurens is a city in Laurens County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 9,139 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Laurens County.

==History==
Located in upstate South Carolina, the city of Laurens is named after Henry Laurens, a South Carolina merchant and rice planter who was one of America&#x27;s wealthiest slave traders. He was a delegate to and second president of the Continental Congress and served as a diplomat. It is part of the Greenville–Mauldin–Easley Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Laurens was established by an act of the General Assembly on March 15, 1785, as a location for commercial activities. It was one of the six counties created from the Old Ninety-Six District of South Carolina. Laurens was originally named Laurensville. On December 15, 1845, a charter was issued with the name of Laurensville. The first appearance of the town name Laurens was in an 1873 charter. The town of Laurens was chartered in 1900 and in 1916. It was named in honor of South Carolina statesman Henry Laurens.

The first inhabitants of Laurens were the Cherokee Indians. They used the land as their hunting and fighting ground. There has been evidence of broken potsherds, weapons, and a mound found linked to Cherokee culture on land now called Laurens. Many treaties were made with the Cherokee over the land known as Laurens County dating to 1721. Before the American Revolution, thousands of immigrants, mainly from Scotland and Ireland, settled in Laurens County. Later Laurens developed into a major intersection of commerce in colonial America. In the Battle of Musgrove Mill, Laurens witnessed intense fighting.

In 1790, after the Revolutionary War, Laurens was elected as the county seat. Like other southern towns, cotton was its major crop. High cotton production led to an economic boom and a substantial increase in the African American population due to the use of African slaves on cotton plantations. This attracted wealthy entrepreneurs and businessmen to Laurens. Future President Andrew Johnson worked as a tailor in downtown Laurens from 1824 to 1826.

Before the beginning of the American Civil War, Laurens provided a great deal of political leaders to the state government. The state&#x27;s decision to secede from the Union was influenced by many of them. The fighting of the Civil War never neared Laurens, but it was affected by the influx of refugees fleeing Charleston to avoid the progressing Union Army and Navy. Several of the refugees settled in Laurens after the war.

In the postwar Reconstruction years, Laurens&#x27;s economy evolved to include industry. The economic recovery relied upon the creation of the textiles and manufacturing industries. Lauren Cotton Mill was founded in 1895 and Watts Mill in 1902. Laurens Glass Company was established in 1910, and was one of the largest glass plants in the southeast for over 80 years. The Laurens Railroad Company was chartered in 1847. The Columbia-Newberry-Laurens Railroad and the Charleston-Western Carolina Railroad are the two major intersections provided by the railroad.

==History==
Bishopville was known as Singleton&#x27;s Crossroads for more than a decade before it was renamed in honor of Jacques Bishop. The of land had been granted to Jacob Chamber by the state of South Carolina in 1786. Daniel Carter later purchased the property and then sold it to William Singleton in 1790.

The tavern owned and operated by Singleton and his wife sat at the intersection of Mecklenburg Road, now Church Street, and McCallum Ferry Road, now Main Street. This tavern was a stop on the stagecoach route between Georgetown and Charlotte. (Now this intersection involves Highway 15, which at one point was the premier north–south route from New York to Miami.) In 1798, William Singleton died, leaving his wife the owner of the tavern until her death in 1820. A year later in 1821, the property was sold to Bishop. During this time period, the area around present-day Bishopville was said to be composed of mostly wilderness, with only a few scattered, primitive houses.

Lee County was created in 1892 with Bishopville its county seat, but Bishopville did not complete building its courthouse and county jail until February 1902. As a result, county boundaries were delimited along Lynches River, Black River, Scape Ore Swamp, Sparrow Swamp, Long Branch, and Screeches Branch following old roads and artificial limits.

On December 15, 1902, Bishopville celebrated its new significance by hosting speeches and shooting off the old cannon in front of the Lee County Courthouse.

Lee County has historically been a leader in cotton production in the state and is the home of the South Carolina Cotton Museum.

In addition to the Lee County Courthouse, the Ashwood School Gymnasium and Auditorium, Bishopville Commercial Historic District, James Carnes House, Dennis High School, Thomas Fraser House, William Apollos James House, The Manor, Mt. Zion Presbyterian Church, William Rogers House, South Main Historic District, Spencer House, and Tall Oaks are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="134563" wikidata="Q2130302" url="?curid=134563" title="Cayce, South Carolina">
<text>Cayce ( ) is a city in the U.S. state of South Carolina, along the Congaree River. The population was 12,528 at the 2010 census and rose to 13,789 in the 2020 United States Census, and it is the third-most populated municipality in Lexington County. The city is primarily in Lexington County, with additional, predominantly rural land to the east in Richland County. Cayce is part of the Columbia Metropolitan Statistical Area and is within South Carolina&#x27;s Midlands region.

==History==
What was to become Cayce was home to Native Americans for at least 12,000 years. This includes what are now known as the Manning Archeological Site, the SAM Site, and the Taylor Site.

Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto reached the area in 1540, encountering a large Native village at Congaree Creek, where Cayce now stands. Near the end of the 17th century, the explorer John Lawson visited and documented his trip. In 1718, during the colonial period, the English built the first permanent fort, the first structure built in the Midlands. A second fort was built on the river in 1748. These were referred to as Congaree Fort #1 and Congaree Fort #2 and became part of the Congarees Site in 1974.
The Guignard Brick Works were established on the west bank of the Congaree in 1803 and remained active for nearly two centuries.

The town includes the area that was once Granby, at one time the county seat and a flourishing community before it was abandoned by the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century.

The town was incorporated in 1914 and named for local businessman William J. Cayce.

In December 2007, the city council voted to annex a floodplain in Richland County. Prior to this annexation, Cayce was entirely situated within Lexington County. The city planned to develop the annexed area, but after significant evaluations the city abandoned the project after determining that development was not suitable in the flood-prone area, leaving Cayce with a sizeable piece of sparely-populated land.
== Geography ==

Cayce is in eastern Lexington County and western Richland County, with the traditional center of town on the west side of the Congaree River at 33°58&#x27;29&quot; north, 81°3&#x27;6&quot; west. The Congaree divides the city from the state capital, Columbia, to the northeast. Cayce is also bordered by the city of West Columbia to the north, the town of Springdale to the northwest, and the town of Pine Ridge to the southwest.

The Riverwalk has four segments with several access points and provides historical markers along the pathway. The park sometimes floods when the Congaree River exceeds flood stage.
* The 12,000-year-old park is built upon land that the city states has not changed much in the past 12,000 years.
* The Timmerman Trail is a hiking and biking trail through the woods. The trail is maintained by SCANA and is located near the company&#x27;s headquarters. The trail is named after the pro-segregationist former governor of South Carolina, George Bell Timmerman Jr.

* Cayce Historical Museum, located at the city&#x27;s municipal complex, includes Native American, colonial, Revolutionary War and Civil War artifacts.

==Economy==

<text>Chapin, popularly known as the &quot;Capital of Lake Murray&quot;, is a small lake town located at the northern tip of Lexington County, South Carolina, United States. Lake Murray separates Chapin from the rest of Lexington County. The population of Chapin was 1,445 according to the 2010 census, and an estimated 1,633 in 2019.

Chapin is located approximately northwest of Columbia, and many people commute there for work; however, the town is considered fringe rural by the US postal service.

The town government is set up in the mayor-council form, and the current mayor is Albert Koon. Chapin has four public schools in the area; the first Chapin school was built in 1924. Lake Murray is the main attraction to Chapin and provides boaters with water-related recreation.

==History==
Chapin was named after Martin Chapin in 1889. After Chapin and Laura Anne Benjamin were married on June 16, 1850, the couple moved down South because of Martin&#x27;s health (a lung condition). The Chapins were living in Columbia when Martin&#x27;s doctor suggested he to move to the Piney Woods area. He bought property in this area, and over the years Chapin bought . He built a home in Piney Woods and later a hotel in the 1880s along the new rail line that ran from Columbia to Laurens, the Columbia, Newberry and Laurens Railroad. The railroad provided a way to trade and transport goods to the capital city. Cotton and the lumber industry were flourishing with the railroad providing transportation. After Martin&#x27;s death on August 31, 1894, Laura Chapin sold their home and moved into the Chapin hotel.

On March 28, 1907, Job S. Wessinger, P.M. Frick, and J. S. Honeycut founded the Bank of Chapin. One year later the building for the bank was built. The bank prospered with help from the railroad.

During World War I, Chapin was doing well economically. The price of cotton had risen and the farmers were making plenty of money. As a result, the Bank of Chapin was also thriving during this time. The first high school was built in 1924.

Slowly the businesses in Chapin were starting to experience hard times nearing the 1930s. On Thursday, October 15, 1931, the Bank of Chapin did not open, and like other banks around the world, the bank would not allow customers to withdraw their money. Anybody who had money saved in the bank lost that money due to the crash of the stock market, later known as the start of the Great Depression. Another disaster to hit Chapin was the building of the dam on the Saluda River that would result in the building of a lake. This lake would take over most of the Chapin families’ farms and homesteads. The building of the dam was started in 1927.

In the midst of the Great Depression Chapin started a recreational team sport of baseball. In 1935, the Dutch Fork League was formed where Chapin had its own team. This team helped the unemployed men occupy their time during these difficult times. These baseball games attracted thousands of people.

During the 1940s Chapin grew through improvements to the school and opening new businesses. One new business that came to Chapin were filling stations. The next business was a cabinet shop called E. A. Frick and Son. Chapin also built paved roads, a baseball field and established the public library. In 1950 the first post office building was constructed, along with new telephone services.

The 1960s were about new and better services. Garbage collection was an issue in the &#x27;60s, so the town government bought land and built a landfill. Transportation was the next service provided by access to an interstate highway. On September 7, 1960, a section of Interstate 26 was opened between Columbia and Pomaria. The interstate made Chapin more accessible. Streets in town were also improved. Another improvement of the &#x27;60s was the new water system. In 1965 a volunteer fire department was organized, and in 1966 the town had its first ambulance. Chapin also started growing in population as more people moved to the town in the 1960s.

During the 1970s new schools were built. Chapin football became a community event, and the school football team won state championships in 1973 and 1974. Also in the &#x27;70s churches in the town of Chapin were growing by establishment of Chapin Baptist Church, St. Francis of Assisi Episcopal Church, Our Lady of the Lake Catholic Church, and Lake Murray Presbyterian Church.

The Robinson-Hiller House was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1998, and the Chapin Commercial Historic District was added in 2019.

===History of local schools===
The first school in Chapin was located in the Chapin house. In 1924 a high school was built out of concrete blocks and brick. In 1927 the school alma mater “Chapin, Dear Chapin” was composed by Helen Miller. This alma mater is the same one used at Chapin High School today.

Chapin schools and churches were the center of life in town according to historian Addison Bostain. Chapin High School had 150 students enrolled in 1929 and the elementary school had 150 students. The school only housed 11 grades.

Chapin High School had been built in separate parts since 1924 and by 1940 the high school still did not have a gym. The school auditorium was home to both the theater and a basketball court. The gymnasium was not built until 1952. The Chapin community built the gym for less than $30,000.

The 12th grade was added to Chapin High School in 1948 as well as the first football team. The football team was a very expensive investment, so in 1952 the Irmo and Chapin High School football teams were combined. Together they were known as the Flying Dutchmen football team. The teams separated again, and Chapin has had its own team since 1959.

In 1970 a new high school was built with much better facilities. The school had new labs, band, chorus, and physical educational areas. In addition to a new building, the Chapin football team became a powerhouse for football in state of South Carolina. Cecil Woolbright became Chapin High School&#x27;s head football coach and athletic director in 1968. The Chapin High School Eagles won two state championships and three conference titles in three years. This happened in 1973, 74 and 75, along with a 30-game winning streak. The Chapin High School&#x27;s mascot is named Cecil the Eagle.

A new elementary school opened in August 1977. The school could house 840 children.

===Library===
Chapin has a public library, a branch of the Lexington County Public Library.

===Lake Murray===
Chapin is often referred to as the &quot;capital of Lake Murray&quot;. On September 21, 1927, work on the dam for the Saluda River was started. The construction finished on June 30, 1930. Chapin families who had lived on Chapin land for over 200 years had to sell and move to make room for the lake that was a result of the dam. The lake was to spread between Dutch Fork and Chapin, becoming wide and long.

The earthen dam stands over tall and runs across. Lake Murray has over of shoreline and covers approximately . The dam itself takes up . The nearest arm of the lake reaches within of the town limits.

The dam on Lake Murray has been through many changes since it was originally built in 1927. In 1943 were added to the dam&#x27;s height to help flooding issues. Much later in the 1980s SCE&amp;G added a sheet piling way on the lakeside of the highway again to help with flooding. This sheet piling way raised the height of the dam again.

The latest changes to the dam occurred in 2002 when the backup dam was built. The backup dam was built for more protection to withstand earthquakes. The backup dam is made of rock and concrete to withstand the weight of the water behind the dam if any damage were to occur to the existing dam.

Lake Murray is not only used to provide electrical power for surrounding areas, it brings boating activities to the area. Lake Murray offers many different types of boating opportunities in addition to recreational areas. Today, the lake has recreational swimming, boating, skiing, fishing, and wake-boarding. The lake also holds fishing tournaments and is home to many kinds of wildlife. Lake Murray is known for its purple martins, striped bass, and great blue heron.

===Labor Day Festival===
Chapin is home to the Chapin Labor Day Festival. The Chapin Labor Day Festival is held every year in the town of Chapin on Labor Day. The festival lasts for three days starting on the Saturday before Labor Day and ending on Labor Day. On Monday, the festival activities start off with a parade through town and often features local, state and sometimes national political candidates. The Chapin High School NJROTC also marches in the parade annually. After the parade there is a carnival, Chapin Idol, vendors, food, concerts, and a car show along the historic streets of downtown Chapin.

==In popular culture==
A chapter in author Ta-Nehisi Coates&#x27; book &quot;The Message&quot; details Coates&#x27; trip to Chapin to meet with a local teacher named Mary Wood who had been forced to drop Coates&#x27; book &quot;Between the World and Me&quot; from her lesson plan after local outcry against the book. Wood invited Coates to accompany her and supporters of hers to a local school board meeting where Wood fought to keep her job.

<text>Lexington is the most populous town in and the county seat of Lexington County, South Carolina, United States. It is a suburb of the state capital, Columbia. The population was 23,568 at the 2020 Census, and it is the second-most populous municipality in the greater Columbia area. The 2022 estimated population is 24,626. According to the Central Midlands Council of Governments, the greater Lexington area had an estimated population of 111,549 in 2020 and is considered the fastest-growing area in the Midlands.

==History==
===Colonial Period===
In 1735, the colonial government of King George II established 11 townships in backcountry South Carolina to encourage settlement and to provide a buffer between Native American tribes to the west and colonial plantations in the Lowcountry. The townships included one named Saxe Gotha, which flourished with major crops of corn, wheat, tobacco, hemp, and flax as well as beeswax and livestock, and its residents were primarily of German and Swiss heritage. Two major Native American trails existed in the area: the Cherokee Path, primary route of English and Scots traders from Charlestown to Native Americans in the Appalachian Mountains, and the Occaneechi Path, which connected natives from the Chesapeake Bay region to North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.

In 1785, the name Saxe Gotha was replaced with Lexington County in commemoration of the Battles of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts. In 1781, the Battle of Muddy Springs was fought to the south of the present-day town and the Battle of Tarrar Springs was fought within the present-day town limits.

===Post-revolution===
Until 1820, Granby was the county seat of Lexington County, but chronic flooding forced the local government to move the courthouse to its present location in Lexington. The area was known by locals as the &quot;Lexington Courthouse&quot; and was not incorporated as the Town of Lexington until 1861.

During Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea in the American Civil War, much of the town of Lexington was destroyed by Union forces as they protected William Sherman&#x27;s western flank as Union troops attacked Columbia. Most of the town of Lexington, including the courthouse, were torched and burned. Like much of the South after the Civil War, Lexington struggled economically, but local farms and the lumber industry helped stabilize the economy after Reconstruction. Many current brick buildings were built in the aftermath of severe fires in 1894 and 1916. By the 1890s, the Columbia to Augusta Railroad and the Lexington Textile Mill prompted the town to grow.

With the advent of the automobile in the 1920s and its mass production in the 1940s and 1950s, Lexington continued to grow as a suburb of Columbia. Additionally, the creation of Lake Murray in 1930 encouraged many to move to Lexington. Between the 1990 Census and the 2000 Census, Lexington&#x27;s population increased by 198%, and by 83% between the 2000 census and the 2010 census.

===Recent history=== 


The &quot;move over law&quot;, a law that requires drivers to change lanes when there is a stopped emergency vehicle on the side of the road, originated in Lexington. James D. Garcia, a paramedic, was struck and injured at an accident scene on January 28, 1994, after attempting to assist a driver that had slid off of the road. The South Carolina Highway Patrol listed Garcia at fault, leading to his work to create this law. The South Carolina General Assembly passed the &quot;move over law&quot; (SC 56–5–1538) 1996 and was revised in 2002 to increase the ease of enforcement and fines. A version of the &quot;move over law&quot; is now in effect in all fifty U.S. states and the District of Columbia; Hawaii was the last to pass legislation in 2012.

On August 16, 1994, Lexington was struck by an F-3 tornado, generated from the remnants of Tropical Storm Beryl, resulting in over 40 injuries and $50 million in damages. From the same tropical storm, 21 other tornados were reported throughout the state, including six in Lexington County.

A Murphy Express gas station on Augusta Highway in Lexington sold a $400 million winning Powerball ticket on September 18, 2013. At the time, it was the fifth largest winning ticket of any United States lottery.

In 2015, remnants from Hurricane Joaquin brought historic flooding to South Carolina. In Lexington, extreme flooding resulted in the destruction of Gibson Park Dam, which led to the subsequent failure of the Old Mill Dam. Gibson Park Dam (pictured right) was reconstructed and opened to the public in 2021; Old Mill Dam was reconstructed in 2022. The flooding additionally resulted in the destruction of several roads and businesses in the town.

==Government==

Lexington has a mayor-council government, consisting of seven council members, including the mayor. Lexington&#x27;s style of government takes the form of a weak-mayor administration; each member of the council and the mayor has one vote in relation to town matters. The mayor does not have any veto authority or any formal power outside of the council. Each member of the council is elected at-large and serves a term of four years.

On December 4, 2023, Hazel Livingston, who had served as Mayor Pro-Tem since 2004, was sworn in as the first woman mayor of Lexington, South Carolina.

On November 5, 2013, incumbent Lexington mayor Randy Halfacre lost a reelection bid to Councilman Steve MacDougall by 18 votes. A recount was initiated but the results remained the same. Steve MacDougall served as mayor for 10 years until 2023.

In 2015, Lexington&#x27;s town council voted in a 5-1 motion to impose a 2% hospitality tax on all prepared food items. As a result, any prepared food item sold in the town, such as fast food or restaurant food items, has a total tax of 9%. The council vote garnered criticism after a county-wide tax referendum failed the year before; if passed the county would have increased sales tax by 1% for traffic improvements. The tax generates over two million dollars annually, and the town uses the funds for road and traffic improvement, including the addition of turn lanes, the upgrading of traffic lights, and the improving of intersections. The largest project completed was the conversion of South Carolina Highway 6 and Church Street to one-way streets in downtown Lexington in 2019. Future projects include the building of an overpass over Interstate 20.

On July 2, 2020, the town council passed a town ordinance requiring citizens to wear face masks in public to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in South Carolina. Councilman Todd Carnes drew criticism after stating three time in the council meeting that the government has &quot;infinite power&quot; to create laws such as these, but opposed enacting a face mask ordinance because &quot;science does not indicate that it helps.&quot;

<text>A mountain bike (MTB) or mountain bicycle is a bicycle designed for off-road cycling. Mountain bikes share some similarities with other bicycles, but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain, which often makes them heavier, more complex and less efficient on smooth surfaces. These typically include a suspension fork, large knobby tires, more durable wheels, more powerful brakes, straight, wide handlebars to improve balance and comfort over rough terrain, and wide-ratio gearing optimized for topography, application (e.g., steep climbing or fast descending) and a frame with a suspension mechanism for the rear wheel. Rear suspension is ubiquitous in heavier-duty bikes and now common even in lighter bikes. Dropper seat posts can be installed to allow the rider to quickly adjust the seat height (an elevated seat position is more effective for pedaling, but poses a hazard in aggressive maneuvers).

Mountain bikes are generally specialized for use on mountain trails, single track, fire roads, and other unpaved surfaces. In addition to being used to travel and recreate on those surfaces, many people use mountain bikes primarily on paved surfaces; some may prefer the upright position, plush ride, and stability that mountain bikes often have. Mountain biking terrain commonly has rocks, roots, loose dirt, and steep grades. Many trails have additional technical trail features (TTF) such as log piles, log rides, rock gardens, skinnies, gap jumps, and wall-rides. Mountain bikes are built to handle these types of terrain and features. The heavy-duty construction combined with stronger rims and wider tires has also made this style of bicycle popular with urban riders and couriers who must navigate through potholes and over curbs.

Since the development of the sport of mountain biking in the 1970s, many new subtypes of mountain biking have developed, such as cross-country (XC), trail, all-mountain, enduro, freeride, downhill, and a variety of track and slalom types. Each of these place different demands on the bike, requiring different designs for optimal performance. MTB development has led to an increase in suspension travel, now often up to , and gearing up to 13 speed, to facilitate both climbing and rapid descents. Advances in gearing have also led to the ubiquity of &quot;1x&quot; drivetrains (pronounced &quot;one-by&quot;), simplifying the gearing to one chainring in the front and a wide range cassette at the rear, typically with 9 to 12 sprockets. 1x gearing reduces overall bike weight, increases ground clearance, and greatly simplifies the process of gear selection, but 2- or 3-ring drivetrains are still common on entry-level bikes.

The expressions &quot;all terrain bicycle&quot;, &quot;all terrain bike&quot;, and the acronym &quot;ATB&quot; are used as synonyms for &quot;mountain bike&quot;, but some authors consider them passé.

==History==
===Origins===

The original mountain bikes were modified heavy cruiser bicycles used for freewheeling down mountain trails. The sport became popular in the 1970s in Northern California, USA, with riders using older, single-speed balloon tire bicycles to ride down rugged hillsides. These modified bikes were called &quot;ballooners&quot; in California, &quot;klunkers&quot; in Colorado, and &quot;dirt bombers&quot; in Oregon. Joe Breeze, a bicycle frame builder, used this idea and developed what is considered the first mountain bike.

It was not until the late 1970s and early 1980s that road bicycle companies started to manufacture mountain bicycles using high-tech lightweight materials, such as M4 aluminum. The first production mountain bike available was the 1979 Lawwill Pro Cruiser. The frame design was based on a frame that Don Koski fabricated from electrical conduit and a Schwinn Varsity frame. Mert Lawwill had Terry Knight of Oakland build the frames. The bikes sold for about $500 new and were made from 1979 though 1980 (approximate run of 600 bikes).

The first mass production mountain bike was the Specialized Stumpjumper, first produced in 1981. With the rising popularity of mountain bikes, Randolph (Randy) Ross, executive vice president of Ross Bicycles Inc., was quoted in the New York Times saying &quot;I&#x27;d say these bikes are one of the biggest things that ever happened to the biking industry. Its basic look constitutes &quot;a total shift in image&quot; for the industry.&quot;

Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, mountain biking moved from a little-known sport to a mainstream activity complete with an international racing circuit and a world championship, in addition to various free ride competitions, such as the FMB World Tour and the Red Bull Rampage.

==Designs==
Mountain bikes can usually be divided into four broad categories based on suspension configuration:
* Rigid: A mountain bike with large, knobby tires and straight handlebars, but with neither front nor rear suspension.
* Hardtail: A mountain bike equipped with a suspension fork for the front wheel, but otherwise a rigid frame.
* Soft tail: A recent addition, a mountain bike with pivots in the frame but no rear shock. The flex of the frame absorbs some vibrations. These bikes are usually cross-country bikes.
* Full suspension (or dual suspension): A mountain bike equipped with both front and rear suspension. The front suspension is usually a telescopic fork similar to that of a motorcycle, and the rear is suspended by a mechanical linkage with components for absorbing shock.

==Modern designs==
===Gears===

Since the 1980s, mountain bikes have had anywhere from 7 to 36 speeds, with 1 to 4 chain-rings on the crankset and 5 to 12 sprockets in the cogset. 30-speed, 33-speed and 36-speed mountain bikes were originally found to be unworkable, as the mud-shedding capabilities of a 10-speed, 11-speed or 12-speed cassette, and the intricacies of a 10-speed, 11-speed or 12-speed rear derailleur were originally not found to be suitable combined with front shifters, although 10, 11 and 12 speed cassettes are now commonplace in single front chainring bicycles, and are also found on some mountain bikes. However, many pro-level mountain bikers have taken to using a narrower 10-speed road chain with a 9-speed setup in an effort to reduce the weight of their bike. In early 2009, component group SRAM announced their release of their XX groupset, which uses a 2-speed front derailleur, and a 10-speed rear derailleur and cassette, similar to that of a road bike. Mud-shedding capabilities of their 10-speed XX cassette are made suitable for MTB use by extensive Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining of the cassette. Due to the time and cost involved in such a product, they were only aimed at top-end XC-racers. However, 10-speed has become the norm by 2011 and the market leader Shimano even offers its budget groupset &quot;Alivio&quot; in a 10-speed version. In July 2012, SRAM announced a 1×11 drivetrain called XX1 that does not make use of a front derailleur for lighter weight and simplicity. In the 2014 Commonwealth Games at Glasgow all leading riders used 1×11 drivetrains. SRAM&#x27;s new 1×12 gearing was introduced in 2016 as SRAM Eagle. This gives a single chain ring bike better ability to climb.

===Geometry===

The critical angles in bicycle geometry are the head angle (the angle of the head tube), and the seat tube angle (the angle of the seat tube). These angles are measured from the horizontal, and drastically affect the rider position and performance characteristics of the bicycle. Mountain bike geometry will often feature a seat tube angle around 73 degrees, with a head tube angle of anywhere from 60 to 73 degrees. The intended application of the bike affects its geometry very heavily. In general, steeper angles (closer to 90 degrees from the horizontal) are more efficient for pedaling up hills and make for sharper handling. Slacker angles (leaning farther from the vertical) are preferred for high speeds and downhill stability.

===Suspension===


In the past mountain bikes had a rigid frame and fork. In the early 1990s, the first mountain bikes with suspension forks were introduced. This made riding on rough terrain easier and less physically stressful. The first front suspension forks had about 1 to 2 inches (38 to 50 mm) of suspension travel. Once suspension was introduced, bikes with front suspension and rigid, non-suspended rear wheels, or &quot;hardtails&quot;, became popular nearly overnight. While the hardtail design has the benefits of lower cost, less maintenance, and better pedaling efficiency, it is slowly losing popularity due to improvements in full suspension designs. Front fork suspensions are now available with of travel or more (see above under Designs.)

Many new mountain bikes integrate a &quot;full suspension&quot; design known as dual suspension, meaning that both the front and rear wheel are fitted with a shock absorber in some form as the wheel attaches to the bike. This provides a smoother ride as the front and rear wheels can now travel up and down to absorb the force of obstacles striking the tires. Dual suspension bikes of a similar quality are considerably more expensive, but this price increase brings an enormous off-road performance upgrade as dual suspension bikes are much faster on downhill and technical/rough sections, than other forms of the mountain bike. This is because when the wheel strikes an obstacle its tendency is to bounce up. Due to some forward energy being lost in the upward movement some speed is lost. Dual suspension bikes solve this problem by absorbing this upward force and transmit it into the shocks of the front and rear wheels, drastically decreasing the translation of forward momentum into useless upward movement. Disadvantages of rear suspension are increased weight, increased price, and with some designs, decreased pedaling efficiency, which is especially noticeable when cycling on roads and hard trails. At first, early rear suspension designs were overly heavy, and susceptible either to pedaling-induced bobbing or lockout.

===Disc brakes===

Most modern mountain bikes use disc brakes. They offer considerably improved stopping power (less lever pressure is required providing greater braking modulation) over rim brakes under all conditions especially adverse conditions, because they are located at the center of the wheel (on the wheel hub). They therefore remain drier and cleaner than wheel rims, which are more readily soiled or damaged. The disadvantage of disc brakes is their increased cost and often greater weight. Disc brakes do not allow heat to build up in the tires on long descents; instead, heat builds up in the rotor, which can become extremely hot.

There are two main types of mountain bike Disc brakes: mechanical disc brakes and hydraulic disc brakes. 

Mechanical disc brakes use a brake cable housed in a brake housing, which connects the brake lever to the brake caliper. When the lever is pulled, it tightens the cable, which in turn actuates the caliper and presses the brake pads against the rotor.

Hydraulic disc brakes, on the other hand, use a sealed hydraulic system instead of a cable. When the brake lever is pulled, it pressurizes the in-compressible brake fluid (typically mineral oil or DOT fluid), which forces the brake pistons to move the pads against the rotor. Hydraulic systems generally provide stronger and more consistent braking performance compared to mechanical brakes.

==Wheel and tire design==
Typical features of a mountain bike are very wide tyres. The original 26 inch wheel diameter with ≈2.125″ width (ISO 559 mm rim diameter) is increasingly being displaced by 29-inch wheels with ≈2.35″ width (ISO 622 mm rim diameter), as well as the 27.5-inch wheel diameter with ≈2.25 widths (ISO 584 mm rim diameter), particular on smaller frame sizes for shorter riders. Mountain bikes with 24-inch wheels are also available, sometimes for dirt jumping, or as a junior bike.

Bicycle wheel sizes are not precise measurements: a 29-inch mountain bike wheel with a bead seat diameter (the term, bead seat diameter (BSD), is used in the ETRTO tire and rim sizing system), and the average 29″ mountain bike tire is (in ISO notation) 59-622 corresponds to an outside diameter of about 29.15 inches (740 mm).

622 mm wheels are standard on road bikes and are commonly known as 700C. In some countries, mainly in Continental Europe, 700C (622 mm) wheels are commonly called 28 inch wheels. 24 inch wheels are used for dirt jumping bikes and sometimes on freeride bikes, rear wheel only, as this makes the bike more maneuverable. 29 inch wheels were once used for only cross country purposes, but are now becoming more commonplace in other disciplines of mountain biking. A mountain bike with 29″ wheels is often referred to as a 29er, and a bike with 27.5-inch wheels is called a 27.5 Mountain bike or as a marketing term ″650B bike&quot;.

Wheels come in a variety of widths, ranging from standard rims suitable for use with tires in the 1.90 to 2.10 in (48 to 53 mm) size, to widths popular with freeride and downhill bicycles. Although heavier wheelsets are favored in the freeride and downhill disciplines, advances in wheel technology continually shave weight off strong wheels. This is highly advantageous as rolling weight greatly affects handling and control, which are very important to the technical nature of freeride and downhill riding.

The widest wheel/tire widths, typically 3.8 in (97 mm) or larger, are sometimes used by icebikers who use their mountain bikes for winter-time riding in snowy conditions.

Manufacturers produce bicycle tires with a wide variety of tread patterns to suit different needs. Among these styles are: slick street tires, street tires with a center ridge and outer tread, fully knobby, front-specific, rear-specific, and snow studded. Some tires can be specifically designed for use in certain weather (wet or dry) and terrain (hard, soft, muddy, etc.) conditions. Other tire designs attempt to be all-around applicable. Within the same intended application, more expensive tires tend to be lighter and have less rolling resistance. Sticky rubber tires are now available for use on freeride and downhill bikes. While these tires wear down more quickly, they provide greater traction in all conditions, especially during cornering. Tires and rims are available in either tubed or tubeless designs, with tubeless tires recently (2004) gaining favor for their pinch flat resistance.

Tires also come with tubes, tubeless and tubeless-ready. Tires with tubes are the standard design and the easiest to use and maintain. Tubeless tires are significantly lighter and often have better performance because you can run them at a lower tire pressure which results in better traction and increasing rolling resistance. Tubeless-ready tires are tires that can use tubes or go tubeless. A liquid sealant is used without the tube to secure the seal to the rim. Popular tire manufacturers include Wilderness Trail Bikes, Schwalbe, Maxxis, Nokian, Michelin, Continental, Tioga, Kenda, Hutchinson, Specialized and Panaracer.

==Tandems==

Mountain bikes are available in tandem configurations. For example, Cannondale and Santana Cycles offer ones without suspension, while Ellsworth, Nicolai, and Ventana manufacture tandems with full suspension.

According to the 2010 census, the population was 14,988, and the 2019 population estimate was 17,998. West Columbia is bordered to the east by Columbia, the state capital, across the Congaree River.

==History==
West Columbia was incorporated in 1894 as &quot;Brookland&quot;, but the U.S. Postal Service called the town &quot;New Brookland&quot; since there was another town called Brookland. In 1936, the name was changed to &quot;West Columbia&quot; to emphasize its proximity to Columbia, the capital. Numerous businesses, churches and a high school retain the Brookland and New Brookland names.

The Gervais Street Bridge, Mount Hebron Temperance Hall, New Brookland Historic District, and Saluda Factory Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The 2008 South Carolina Learjet 60 crash occurred just before midnight on September 19, 2008, when a Learjet 60 (registration ) crashed while taking off from Columbia Metropolitan Airport. The weather at the time was cool, dry, and clear. The plane hit runway lights and crashed through the boundary fence, crossing South Carolina Highway 302 (SC 302/Edmund Highway/Airport Boulevard), and coming to rest on an embankment by the side of the highway. No one on the ground was hurt, but four of the six people on the plane (including both pilots) died in the crash, while the other two, Travis Barker (the drummer of Blink-182) and Adam Goldstein (DJ AM of Crazy Town), suffered severe burns. The plane was a charter flight taken by Barker, Goldstein and their entourage following a performance by their musical group TRV$DJAM at a free concert in Five Points earlier that night to Van Nuys, California.

Some sixty years after the first permanent settlement in South Carolina, a group of English settlers sent out by the Lords Proprietor landed in Georgetown and moved up the Pee Dee River to the junction of the Little Pee Dee River about halfway between Georgetown and the present town of Marion. Among these families were Brittons, Davis, Flaglers, Giles, Graves and Tyler. At about the same time, and maybe on the same ship from England, came Captain John Godbold, a retired English sea captain. He moved farther up the Big Pee Dee and settled on Catfish Creek. The creek is southwest of and very near to the present city limits of Marion.

During its early colonial years the area was part of Craven County. When Craven was divided, this segment of land was placed in Georgetown District and was known as Gilesboro after Colonel Hugh Giles, an American Revolutionary war hero who fought under Francis Marion. In 1785, another division was made and the name &quot;Liberty&quot; was used for a short time to designate this area.

On December 17, 1847, when by an act of the South Carolina Legislature a charter was issued to the town, its official name was given as &quot;Marion&quot;. The name honors General Francis Marion, a hero of the Revolutionary War.

===Court House===
A commission was appointed by the South Carolina Legislature to locate the site for a court house. Court was scheduled for the first Monday in March 1800. The court house was not complete, so it was held in a log building on Colonel Hugh Giles&#x27; plantation about two miles below Marion. The section was called Gilesboro or Gilesboro Court House for some time after. The Commissioners appointed to select the site for the Court House were offered land by several land owners in the vicinity, including Giles, but they chose and accepted four acres from Thomas Godbold, a grandson of Captain John Godbold. The present Court House was erected in 1854 and is the third Court House on or near the same site.

During the Revolutionary War, the people of Marion County were divided in their loyalties. There were ardent Patriots under Col. Hugh Giles, Capt. John Dozier, Capt. Stephen Godbold and others. Maj. Micajah Ganey and Capt. Jessee Barfield led the Loyalists. Before the end of the war, most of the Loyalists had pledged allegiance to the colonists due to the activities of General Francis Marion in the area. The Revolutionary battles in the county were Port&#x27;s Ferry, Blue Savannah and Bowling Green.

During the American Civil War, Marion County was spared damage from Sherman&#x27;s troops due to the Big Pee Dee River being at flood stage. The troops were unable to cross the river. The county fully participated in the reconstruction and in 1876 there were Red Shirt organizations in every township.

Marion mascot is Swamp foxes.

===Railroad===
Marion County had several periods of growth. With the building and completion of the Wilmington to Manchester Railroad in 1854, business and transportation improved. Gen. W.W. Harllee was the first president of the railroad; the town of Florence, to the west of Marion, was named for his daughter. The second president was Col. William S. Mullins for whom the town of Mullins was named. Col. William S. Mullins- birth- 1824 Fayetteville, Cumberland County, North Carolina.

<text>Nichols is a town in Marion County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 368 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Nichols is located at (34.232779, -79.148513).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

== History ==
The town was founded around the same time as Marion and Mullins, which was sometime after 1854 and was initially known as Floydsville. This was due to the land being on Harman Floyd&#x27;s land that was sold off as town lots after his passing. These lots were surrounding depots for the Wilmington and Manchester Railroad. The town experienced a minor boom due to the turpentine industry, which shortly died out and was replaced by the tobacco industry. Later on, the town was renamed to its current title of Nichols, this time to honor Averett B. Nichols, who was a businessman that built a warehouse and store to take advantage of the tobacco boom and owned other stores in the town beside those of John H. Stroud and C. R. Ford. Following World War II, a popular employer was a local store focusing in furniture that went by the name Pilliod of Carolina.

The town suffered severe flooding from Hurricane Matthew from the nearby Lumber River in 2016. Five months after the hurricane, 216 of the town&#x27;s 261 homes remained vacant. Two of six churches remained closed, as were 15 of 22 businesses, the library, and most of the fire and police department resources. Mayor Lawson Battle suggested that the State House request that the Senate requisition $700,000 to help repair nearly 400 water-damaged buildings, replace vehicles, and reopen government offices. State Senator Kent Williams proposed this money be taken from the $4.5 million left over from a 2015 farmer aid package for storm damage.

<text>Bennettsville is a city located in the U.S. state of South Carolina on the Great Pee Dee River. As the county seat of Marlboro County, Bennettsville is noted for its historic homes and buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries—including the Bennettsville Historic District which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

According to the 2010 census, Bennettsville has a population of 9,069.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (10.13%) is water.

==History==

The city of Bennettsville was founded in 1819 on the Great Pee Dee River and named after Thomas Bennett, Jr., then governor of South Carolina. The area was developed for short-staple cotton cultivation, dependent on the labor of enslaved African Americans. Many were brought to the upland area from the Lowcountry, carrying their Gullah culture with them. Others were transported from the Upper South by slave traders. This shift to cotton cultivation in the uplands was based on the development of the cotton gin, which made short-staple cotton, cotton with relatively short fibers, profitable. The advent of the gin in turn led to development of large cotton plantations throughout the Deep South.

In the same year, the S.C. General Assembly authorized the relocation of the courthouse from the eastern bank of the Great Pee Dee River to a more central location, selecting a apple orchard located on a bluff above Crooked Creek. The new courthouse was designed by South Carolina architect Robert Mills. Streets were developed radiating courthouse square, one of the state&#x27;s largest. In 1852, the Mills building was replaced.

In 1865 during the last year of the Civil War, the city was occupied by Union troops. During this time, the Jennings-Brown House and the first County Courthouse were used as the headquarters for General William T. Sherman. The new courthouse escaped burning. This is one of the few county seats that has preserved records dating to 1785; they are available for genealogical research.

In 1884, another Second Empire-style courthouse was built on the site. In 1952-1954 it was later enlarged with additions, and the 1884 portion constitutes the central portion of the current building. Additions included two-story red brick wings and the present clock steeple, all designed by Bennettsville architect Henry D. Harrall.

In 1885, Duncan Donald McColl financed development of the first railroad, bank and textile mills in Bennettsville, stimulating the economy as the town was connected to other markets and built an industry. The economy boomed during this &quot;king cotton&quot; era. The city became the center of one of the richest agricultural areas in the state. In the 20th century, the State of South Carolina designated Bennettsville as one its first &quot;G.R.E.A.T. Town&quot; (Governor&#x27;s Rural Economic Achievement Trophy).

==Registered historic sites==

Buildings and districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places include Appin, the Bennettsville Historic District, Jennings-Brown House, Magnolia, Robertson-Easterling-McLaurin House, and the nearby Welsh Neck-Long Bluff-Society Hill Historic District.

The Bennettsville Historic District was designated and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Its contributing buildings include the Jennings-Brown House (1826), the Female Academy (1830), the Medical Museum (1902), and the Murchison School (1902), as well as other residences in the Queen Anne and Beaux Arts style.

==Facilities==
In the 21st century, a new Marlboro County library was constructed. Named in honor of national activist Marian Wright Edelman, who was born and grew up in Bennettsville, it opened on February 22, 2010. She founded the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund, to promote programs for children and mothers.

The library is located on at the intersection of Marlboro Street and Fayetteville Avenue adjacent to the Murchison building (1902) and is a new single-story building with approximately . Its front tower is oriented on axis with that of the Murchison Building. The building&#x27;s cost was supported by $1.325 million in federal funding. The Library holds 60,000 volumes and has two conference rooms, seating 50 and 12.

==Economy==
The county is still largely rural, with limited job opportunities. The county seat serves as a trading center for the county.

The Federal Correctional Institution, Bennettsville was built outside of the city in the county. It is a medium-security prison for male prisoners, and has an associated minimum-security camp holding 139 prisoners. Together the facility houses 1776 prisoners.

<text>McColl is a town in Marlboro County, South Carolina, United States. It lies in the state&#x27;s Pee Dee region, from the North Carolina border. The population was 2,174 at the 2010 census.

McColl is the home of the Pee Dee Indian Tribe. They are a relatively small American Indian tribe that has occupied the Pee Dee region for several centuries. While they received state recognition from the Government of South Carolina just after the beginning of the 21st Century, they have been seeking federal acknowledgment since 1976. While today the tribe consists of just over 200 enrolled members, they were once a significant cultural and political power in the region. Their profound influence and continual presence in the area is why the region bears the Pee Dee name. Since 1976, the tribe’s official seat of government has operated on land awarded to the tribe in Marlboro County.

==History==
This area is within territory occupied by the Pee Dee of the South Appalachian Mississippian culture for several hundred years. Among their earthwork monuments is Town Creek Indian Mound, an important regional ceremonial site that was occupied from about 1150 to 1400 CE in Montgomery County, North Carolina, before they abandoned it for unknown reasons. It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1966, the only American Indian site so honored in the state. In 2017, the Pee Dee Indian Tribe officially began work on the Pee Dee Tribal Mounds located on tribal land in McColl.

Some of this area was developed for the cultivation of short-staple cotton in the antebellum era after the invention of the cotton gin. The area was also a center of lumbering and turpentine production in the early 20th century.

The town was named for D. D. McColl, a businessman.

In 2024 the town&#x27;s mayor, George Garner II, died when his car collided with a truck while being pursued by a Marlboro Country police cruiser days after the entire McColl police force resigned. According to the coroner, the pursuit was &quot;not related to any laws being broken, but rather an effort to protect the well being of Mr. Garner.&quot;

The mountain was referred to as Ruff&#x27;s Mountain until sometime in the 1800s. It was part of Lexington County until 1917 when the current border was established. Property in this area was not recorded in the Newberry County tax records until some time in the 1920s. The Eastern side of the mountain was once owned by Sam Birge, and later Arthur Kohn. It would change hands between the two several times before coming into the possession of the Derrick family in the 1930s. The other side, including what became the town of Little Mountain, was owned by Abraham N. Boland.

===The Town===
Frederick H. Dominick was appointed as postmaster in May 1852. Abraham Noah Boland was appointed as postmaster of the Little Mountain Post Office in 1888. The town was founded around a railroad station in 1890: Boland&#x27;s farm became the site of the depot when the C. N. &amp; L Railroad (Columbia, Newberry, &amp; Laurens Railroad Company) began operation. The town was incorporated and Boland became the first mayor of the town. Today, Boland is considered the &quot;Father of Little Mountain.&quot;
Early residents were farmers of corn, cotton and grain. The town has become a bedroom community for Columbia, the state capital, 30 miles to the southeast. 

===Education===
In 1892, a school was opened in a tenant house and taught by the pastor of Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, Rev. S. L. Nease. Later a one-room school building was built on an acre of land donated by Noah Boland. Increased enrollment brought a two-room building and finally, in 1908 the plans were made to build the present Little Mountain Elementary School. Several additions and modifications have been made to the building since its original construction.

==Geography==
Little Mountain is located at (34.195161, -81.413946).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.1 square miles (2.7 km), all land.

Little Mountain is located on Interstate 26 at Exit 85, which is approximately from the heart of downtown.

==Demographics==

According to the United States Census Bureau https://www.census.gov/popest in 2013 population in town was estimated to be 292 people and 142 households. The median household income in the town is $56,250 with 2.9% of residents living below the poverty line. This compares to the South Carolina average median household income of $44,779. The education of town residents is 93.8% with at least a high school degree compared to South Carolina&#x27;s average of 84.5%.

== Government ==

The Town of Little Mountain has a mayor-council form of government. On March 15, 2013, Jana Jayroe was sworn in as the mayor. Jayroe has been a resident of the town for twenty years and served previously as mayor pro tem and as a member of the town council. Jana Jayroe&#x27;s term as mayor of Little Mountain expires on December 31, 2024. The members of the council as of January 2021 are Marty Frick, John &quot;Steve&quot; White, Laura McLeod and David Bowers. Cindy Z. Farr is the town clerk.

==Little Mountain Town Reunion==
Every year, the town of Little Mountain hosts the &quot;Little Mountain Town Reunion&quot; during the month of August. The Little Mountain Reunion is one of South Carolina’s oldest folk festivals. It began in 1882, as an effort by a person connected to Newberry College for encouraging local class reunions, the hope being that it would generate interest in the new college. The college experienced a number of setbacks since its organization; misused by Federal troops during the Civil War, moved to Walhalla in the upper part of South Carolina, and finally back to Newberry, the county seat of Newberry County. Because most people travelled either on two or four feet due to the lack of trains and automobiles, meeting places were selected mainly on the convenience of their location.

The Newberry Observer documents that in 1882, this group met first at Corinth Lutheran Church across the Saluda River. It was probably in the next year, or possibly the following year, that the officials decided to try the site at Little Mountain. The event was so successful that it was decided by those present that each year a Newberry College Reunion would be held at the foot of Little Mountain. The event took place on property recently purchased by A. N. Boland from Frederick Henry Dominick. He was quite agreeable to this plan and for many years prepared and sold barbecue, rice and hash, lemonade, and ice cream to those who attended. For those who wished to bring along their own picnic, tables were erected between trees. Every year, people came riding in on horseback or in buggies, wagons, carts, etc. Then in 1890, when the first train came through Little Mountain, old-timers recall how more coaches were added at reunion time to bring people from Irmo, Ballentine, White Rock, Hilton, Chapin, Clinton, Goldville, Kinards, Prosperity, Newberry and Slighs

A typical Little Mountain Reunion afforded not only a time to renew friendships made at school but also the time to catch up on political thinking and the state of politics in the Dutch Fork. A welcoming address by the president of Newberry College made everyone feel at home and gave a pretty good idea of the state of the college.

These reunions became a traditional part of the community, situated in the heart of the Dutch Fork area, and were eagerly anticipated by everybody in the area. The simple pleasures afforded here along with the community spirit helped maintain the reunion until the eve of World War II.

In 1976, the Town of Little Mountain and the Ruritan Club decided to renew the reunion as a bicentennial project. The idea generated a great deal of enthusiasm in the town. The festival was such a success that the Little Mountain Association was formed and the Little Mountain Reunion again became an annual affair.

The 2012 Reunion was cancelled, reportedly due to contract and liability issues between the Little Mountain Town Council and the Little Mountain Reunion Association.

During the August 2013 Town Council meeting, the council voted to have the Little Mountain Reunion brought back starting August 2014. Mayor Jana Jayroe led the movement to solve the problems between the town and the Little Mountain Reunion Association.

== History==
European settlers (primarily German, Scots-Irish, and English) began arriving in great numbers in the 1750s. Newberry County was formed from the Ninety-Six District in 1785. Because of its central location, the town of Newberry was chosen in 1789 as the county seat for Newberry County, which was part of an extensive area of cotton plantations. County and town politics were dominated by planters. By the coming of the railroad in 1851, Newberry had become a thriving trade center. This remained the case until the 1860s.

During the American Civil War, Newberry College was used as a hospital for Confederate and later Union troops. The historic Newberry Court House was not burned by William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s troops as he swept through the South.

Violent racial incidents hit all over the country as part of the 1919 Red Summer. On July 24, 1919 there was the attempted lynching of Elisha Harper of Newberry. Harper was sent to jail for insulting a 14-year-old girl.

<text>Whitmire is a town in Newberry County, South Carolina, United States, along the Enoree River. The population was 1,390 at the 2020 census. The town was named for George Fredrick Whitmire, who came from Stuttgart, Germany.

==History==

The earliest settler in what is now Whitmire was John Duncan, who built a house along the creek that now bears his name. The George Frederick Whitmire family arrived prior to the 1790s (1790 Census) and established a tavern and post office. The arrival of the Georgia, Carolina and Northern Railway in 1890 led to the town&#x27;s rapid growth. Whitmire incorporated in 1891.

In 1902, William Coleman and several associates established a large textile factory known as the Glenn-Lowery Mill, which included 900 looms and 33,000 spindles. By 1911, the mill had nearly doubled in size. Later owners continued to expand the mill, and it would remain a major source of revenue for Whitmire throughout the 20th century.

A fire in 1916 destroyed much of downtown Whitmire, which consisted primarily of wooden buildings. The town passed a series of new fire ordinances, and the business district was rebuilt with brick. Many of these buildings are still standing.

In 1924, Whitmire attempted to &quot;secede&quot; from Newberry County and form a new county known as Carlisle County. The new county would have consisted of parts of Newberry County, Laurens County, and Union County, with Whitmire as the county seat. The county&#x27;s organizers failed to acquire the necessary amount of land, however, and the initiative failed.

==Geography==
Whitmire is located at (34.502227, -81.614162). The town is concentrated around the intersection of U.S. Route 176 and South Carolina Highway 72, northwest of Columbia and southeast of Spartanburg. The town&#x27;s eastern boundary lies along the Enoree River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.3 square miles (3.3 km2), all land.

<doc id="134604" wikidata="Q2679162" url="?curid=134604" title="Seneca, South Carolina">
<text>Seneca is a city in Oconee County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 8,102 at the 2010 census. It is the principal city of the Seneca Micropolitan Statistical Area (population 74,273 at the 2010 census), an (MSA) that includes all of Oconee County, and that is included within the greater Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson, South Carolina Combined Statistical Area (population 1,266,995 at the 2010 census). Seneca was named for the nearby Cherokee town of &quot;Isunigu&quot;, which English colonists knew as &quot;Seneca Town&quot;.

==History==

In the antebellum period, this area was part of the Pickens District, South Carolina. The state had used jurisdictions such as parish, county, district, and county again in its history. Oconee County was not organized until 1868, after the American Civil War.

Seneca was founded in 1873, during the Reconstruction era, as the railroad town &quot;Seneca City&quot;, named for the Seneca River and a historic Cherokee town known as &quot;Isunigu&quot;. It was called Seneca in a kind of transliteration by British colonists.

Seneca City was developed at the intersection of the Blue Ridge Railroad and the newly built Atlanta and Charlotte Air Line Railroad. Both lines are now part of the Norfolk Southern Railway. A. W. Thompson and J. J. Norton, who were locating engineers for the Air Line Railroad, purchased the land from Col. Brown of Anderson, South Carolina, also in the large Pickens District. A stake marking the center of town was driven into the ground at the intersection of the railroad tracks and the current Townville Street. The land was divided into lots for a one-half mile from the stake. An auction was held on August 14, 1873. The town was given a charter by the state legislature on March 14, 1874. In 1908, the name was changed to the shorter Seneca.
Seneca developed as a marketing and shipping point for cotton, the major commodity crop in this uplands area. During the harvest, wagons bringing cotton would line up for blocks from the railroad station. A passenger terminal, several hotels, and a park were built near the railroad tracks. Recently, this park was named the Norton-Thompson Park in honor of the city&#x27;s founders.

The first school was built in 1874. The community also was home of the Seneca Institute - Seneca Junior College, established here in 1899 as an historically black college. It was reserved for African-American students until 1939.
Textile mills were built in the area; a plant-and-mill village was built in 1893 by the Courtenay Manufacturing Company in Newry on the Little River, which supplied hydropower for the mill. W.L. Jordon built another textile plant and mill village east of Seneca. This village has been called Jordania, Londsdale, and Utica; these changes accompanied changes in ownership of the plant. The J. P. Stevens Plant, which was later called the Westpoint Stevens Plant, was a large textile mill built on Lake Hartwell. Its workforce was integrated, unlike most other plants that hired only whites. Many other textile mills were developed in this area. These plants were the main industry for Seneca for the first half of the twentieth century. With the shift of these jobs overseas, these textile mills are now closed.

In the late 20th century, major dam projects were constructed n the Keowee and other local rivers, to support recreation and public utilities. These projects created three major lakes: Lake Hartwell in 1963, Lake Keowee in 1971, and Lake Jocassee in 1974, stimulating development in Seneca and the region. Duke Power&#x27;s Oconee Nuclear Station was built on Lake Keowee, drawing cooling water for its operations from the lake.

The recreation provided by the lakes, and other attractions, such as nearby Clemson University attracted many retirees from other parts of the country. Retirement communities have been built in the area. Concerned about over-development, some residents formed the Friends of Lake Keowee Society (FOLKS) to advocate for balance.

Early on April 13, 2020, a high-end EF3 tornado struck residential areas south and east of Seneca. Many buildings were damaged or destroyed and one person was killed.

<text>Walhalla is a city in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Oconee County, South Carolina, United States. Designated in 1868 as the county seat, it lies within the area of the Blue Ridge Escarpment, an area of transition between mountains and piedmont, and contains numerous waterfalls. It is located from Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina.

This European-American city was founded after Indian Removal of the Cherokee in 1838. Early residents were predominantly German immigrants who had been refugees from the German revolutions of 1848-1849. Some English and Scotch-Irish farmers also settled here. During the Reconstruction era, when Oconee County was organized in 1868, the state legislature designated Walhalla as its county seat.

While its population was 4,072 as of the 2020 census, &quot;Walhalla&quot; is used both colloquially and practically to refer to a larger area than is within city limits, often being expanded to the whole 29691 zip code. This larger area has a higher, more spread-out population. 

==History==

The German Colonization Society of Charleston was founded in 1848 to aid a wave of immigrants from the failures of the German revolutions of 1848-1849 and settle them in The Upstate; in the aftermath, numerous liberal merchants and farmers immigrated to the United States. Society trustees including General John A. Wagener, Claus Bullwinkel, John C. Henckel, Jacob Schroder, and Christopher F. Seeba bought of land for $27,000 from Reverend Joseph Grisham of West Union in the Pickens District on December 24, 1849, to support German settlement in this area.

As mostly political refugees, the German colonists named their settlement Valhalla, in reference to the afterlife in Norse Mythology where warriors would go if selected to fight during Ragnarök. The Germans had sailed from the port of Hamburg, Germany to Charleston. Many were from Bavaria, and the ship also carried some English and Scots-Irish immigrants.

When Oconee County was organized in 1868, Walhalla was selected as the county seat. After this the predominant German population was diluted and became outnumbered by an influx of new settlers, mostly former British settlers from surrounding counties such as Pickens and Anderson.

Ellicott Rock, Keil Farm, Oconee County Cage, Oconee Station and Richards House, St. John&#x27;s Lutheran Church, Stumphouse Tunnel Complex, and Walhalla Graded School are natural formations and structures in Walhalla that have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1988, Walhalla elected their first (and only) female mayor, Gladys Pepper.

==Geography==
Walhalla is located at (34.767263, -83.064321). The city developed in the northwestern part of the state near the Georgia and North Carolina borders. South Carolina Highway 28 and South Carolina Highway 183 intersect here. The small town of West Union borders Walhalla to the east.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (1.33%) is water.

The town is built mostly upon granite rock. Near some minor faults, it has been subject to small and infrequent earthquakes. The last nearby earthquake had its epicenter in Newry, South Carolina, and occurred at 7:42 am EDT on May 19, 1971. The earthquake had an intensity of VI (strong) in Newry as measured by the Mercalli intensity scale. The cause of the Newry quake was likely a slippage of the Brevard Fault and other faults in the area, aided by the immense weight of the man-made Lake Keowee, created by the Keowee Dam.

The Stumphouse Mountain Tunnel is located near Walhalla.

<doc id="134609" wikidata="Q1939098" url="?curid=134609" title="Bowman, South Carolina">
<text>Bowman is a town in Orangeburg County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 968 at the 2010 census, a decline from 1,198 in 2000.

==Geography==
Bowman is located at .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==History==

Interest in building a town at the intersection of present-day US 178 (Charleston Highway) and S.C. 210 (Branchville-Providence Roads) was evidenced in the acquisition of substantial properties of the Reddick A. Bowman estate by one Samuel W. Dibble, Sr. of Orangeburg, SC in 1887. The Smoak Tramway, a six-mile logging railroad extending from Branchville toward north Four Holes Swamp which was chartered in 1884, was also targeted for acquisition by Dibble&#x27;s associate, Thomas M. Raysor, who operated the Raysor Mill near Stokes. These actions, aimed at developing and exploiting the agricultural and lumbering potential of an area that had remained rather dormant since the American Civil War, were taking place in the late 1880s. These represented the prelude to the chartering of the future Town of Bowman and the transportation and land development organizations and operations which preceded its chartering.

The site chosen for Bowman was actually situated in the center of a rice farming country, later transformed into a major cotton-producing area where the land has a clay sub-soil, ideal for this and other crops. it was located on an old road that was traveled in colonial days by people going from Charleston to Orangeburg, and which was once alleged to have been known as Oak Ridge, a plateau about ten miles long and five miles wide.

One of the oldest remaining operating companies located in Bowman, South Carolina, is V.P. Kiser Lumber Company, which now produces pine shingles. Some wood from Kiser Lumber Company was used to build Bowman&#x27;s UFO Welcome Center.

==Tornado==
On the afternoon of December 5, 1977, a tornado, approaching from the west parallel to Highway 210, struck the downtown area. Three people were injured, the streets were littered with glass and debris, a few trailers were demolished, buildings were unroofed, and a power failure occurred. No people were killed.

==Post office==
In the early years immediately prior to the founding of Bowman, mail service amounted to once or twice-a-week deliveries from Orangeburg by horse and buggy to outlying communities, such as Rileys, Connors and Ruples. The first post office in the Town of Bowman was located at Railroad Avenue and Ott Street (later Main Street) in the store of John W. Berry, a pioneer merchant, and he served as the first postmaster. The building also served as a residence, and it had the first telephone between Bowman and Branchville. The postal system of those early years in Bowman&#x27;s history involved horse and buggy deliveries about twice a week from Orangeburg, and patrons from both town and surrounding areas had to pick up their mail from the post office until rural routes and carriers were organized to deliver mail outside the town limits in the early 1900s. Three rural routes were operational by 1907. The earliest carriers of record were W. H. Dukes, W. L. Bishop, O. P. Evans and Andrew Stroman, Sr. A fourth route was later added to serve the surrounding area, since reduced to three, and finally to the current two routes.
==War memorial==

In 1987, a monument and eternal flame were constructed for residents who died in war:

World War I
* James Edward Easterlin
* John Wesley Weathers
* John Moorer Livingston

World War II
* James Edmund Berry
* Thomas Richard Edwards
* Leonard Everett Berry
* George Arthur Kemmerlin
* Benjamin Franklin Knight

Vietnam War
* James Allen Johnson
* Henry Dennis West, III
* Jessie Clarence Felder

==UFO Welcome Center==
Bowman is home to the former UFO Welcome Center roadside attraction, which is &quot;Major Fun&quot; according to Roadside America. 
As of 2024 the UFO Welcome Center in Bowman, South Carolina unfortunately has burned down and is no longer available to visit. There are no plans on rebuilding the Welcome Center at this time.

<doc id="134614" wikidata="Q3453208" url="?curid=134614" title="Edisto Island">
<text>Edisto Island is one of South Carolina&#x27;s Sea Islands, the larger part of which lies in Charleston County, with its southern tip in Colleton County. Edisto Beach is in Colleton County, and the Charleston County part of the island is unincorporated.

The island, the town, and the Edisto River are named after the historic Edistow people, a Native American sub-tribe of the Cusabo Indians, who inhabited the island as well as nearby mainland areas.

==History==
Indigenous peoples often had fishing camps on the islands, using them seasonally. The historic Edisto people are known to have occupied the island as well as mainland areas and traded with the upcountry Catawba. The sub-tribe became extinct during the colonial period. The Wassamasaw Tribe of Varnertown Indians is a group of descendants of various tribes, including Edisto, who intermarried and who have occupied a settlement between Summerville and Moncks Corner in Berkeley County, South Carolina. In 2009, they gained state recognition as an Indian Tribe, one of nine tribes to do so.

The first tracts of land, called plantations, were granted on Edisto Island before 1700. There were several attempts by the French and the Spanish to settle in this area in the 1500s, however, those attempts all failed. The first group of Europeans who succeeded in settling Edisto Island were English people who settled the island in the late 1600s and early 1700s. Though it is unclear when the modern name was adopted, the island was called &quot;Locke Island&quot;, after the English philosopher and Secretary to the Lords Proprietors of Carolina John Locke, during the late 1600s. For most of the 1700s, the area exported rice. Landowners first harvested timber and deerskins, planted indigo and some rice, and kept herds of free-ranging cattle to produce hides for the European market and salt beef for Caribbean plantations. Cotton gradually became the principal crop, and after the American Revolution, Edisto Island planters became wealthy and famous from their production of long-staple Sea Island cotton. The labor was 
done by hundreds of enslaved Africans who developed the creole Gullah language and culture on the islands and in the Lowcountry, distinctive for its African traditions.

During the American Revolution, there were huge amounts of British soldiers present on Edisto Island. After retaking Savannah in 1778, the British pushed into South Carolina, during this time Beaufort was made into their headquarters and large amounts of British troops were stationed on Edisto Island under the capture of Charleston in 1780.

The 1790 census reported the island had a population of 223 Whites and 1,692 Black slaves. The 1860 census indicated 329 Whites and 5,082 slaves.

===Civil war===

Edisto Island was largely abandoned by planters in November and December 1861, and escaped slaves began setting up their own refugee camps there. In January 1862, armed settlers from the island and Confederate forces clashed, and a Confederate raid in reprisal killed unarmed settlers. In February, Union forces were stationed on the island to develop it as a staging area for future campaigns against Charleston, twenty-five miles away, as well as to protect the colony, which would eventually number thousands of settlers. As Union forces took control of the island, a number of skirmishes occurred, and Confederates withdrew. Pineberry Battery was further up the Edisto River from the island, which was one likely path for a land campaign against Charleston. In June, most of the Union troops left the island in a campaign, which culminated in the Battle of Secessionville. In July, the remaining troops withdrew, and the colony was removed to St. Helena Island. For the rest of the war, a small number of escaped slaves and plantation owners remained and farmed the island, but it was largely abandoned. Near the end of the war, the island was again used as a location of colonies of freed slaves.

===Reconstruction===
From 1865 until 1877 the Island was primarily run by agents of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau as well by recently freed African-Americans. As a result, the island became a base of support for the Republican Party. While Klan terror effected much of the state, Edisto Island was largely spared this by coincidence. There were large amounts of troops from the United States Army present on Edisto Island, and the population was overwhelmingly African-American. Most whites on the island were either troops from the United States Army or agents of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau. As a result, the Klan deemed the area not worth it, and focused their activities elsewhere in the state.

===Historic preservation===
Since the twentieth century, the island has been redeveloped for use as a tourist destination and resorts, although some private plantations remain.

The Alexander Bache U.S. Coast Survey Line, Bailey&#x27;s Store, Bleak Hall Plantation Outbuildings, Brick House Ruins, Brookland Plantation, Cassina Point, Crawford&#x27;s Plantation House, Edisto Island Baptist Church, Edisto Island Presbyterian Church, Fig Island, Frogmore, Paul Grimball House Ruins, Hutchinson House, Middleton&#x27;s Plantation, Oak Island, Old House Plantation, Peter&#x27;s Point Plantation, Presbyterian Manse, Prospect Hill, William Seabrook House, Seaside School, Seaside Plantation House, Spanish Mount Point, Sunnyside, Hephzibah Jenkins Townsend&#x27;s Tabby Oven Ruins, Trinity Church, Wescott Road, and Windsor Plantation are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

Edisto Island is located southwest of Charleston. Edisto Island is home to Edisto Beach and Wyndham Oceanridge resort.

Edisto Beach State Park is also located on the island. The park is open to day visitors as well as tent and RV camping. The park has a ranger station, bathrooms with running water and showers, a playground, and an education center. The campsites are unique in that there are many that are on the beachfront, overlooking the ocean. Hanging moss trees shade the park. Each site is equipped with electricity and water hook ups, a fire pit, and a picnic table.

<text>Orangeburg, also known as &quot;The Burg&quot;, is the principal city in and the county seat of Orangeburg County, South Carolina, United States. The population of the city was 13,964 according to the 2020 census. The city is located 37 miles southeast of Columbia, on the north fork of the Edisto River.

Two historically black institutions of higher education are located in Orangeburg: Claflin University (a liberal arts college) and South Carolina State University (a public university).

==History==

===18th century===
European settlement in this area started in 1704 when George Sterling set up a post here for fur trade with Native Americans. To encourage settlement, the General Assembly of the Province of South Carolina in 1730 organized the area as a township, naming it Orangeburg for William IV, Prince of Orange, the son-in-law of King George II of Great Britain. In 1735, a colony of 200 Swiss, German and Dutch immigrants formed a community near the banks of the North Edisto River. The site was attractive because of the fertile soil and the abundance of wildlife. The river provided the all-important transportation waterway to the port of Charleston on the Atlantic coast for the area&#x27;s agriculture and lumber products, and for shipping goods upriver. The town soon became a well-established and successful colony, composed chiefly of small yeomen farmers.

Orangeburg&#x27;s first church was established by a German Lutheran congregation. It later identified as an Anglican Church, which was the established church and exempt from colonial taxation. The church building was erected prior to 1763 in the center of the village; it was destroyed by fighting during the Revolutionary War. A new church was built; during the Civil War, it was used as a smallpox hospital by General William Tecumseh Sherman on his march through with Union forces.

===19th century===
After the American Revolution, the character of the county changed dramatically. Invention by Eli Whitney of a mass-produced cotton gin for processing short-staple or &quot;green seed&quot; cotton made this type of cotton profitable. It was easily grown in the upland areas, and the county was rapidly developed into large cotton plantations. Agricultural labor was provided by enslaved African Americans, many brought into the area in a forced migration from the coastal areas or the Upper South via the domestic slave trade. Slaves became the majority of population in the county and city. Freed after the Civil War, blacks began to gain educations, and two colleges were established in the city, the second designated as a land grant institution for all black students in the state under segregation. Blacks were also subject to Jim Crow laws passed by the Democrat-dominated state legislature; they were deprived of their ability to vote by South Carolina&#x27;s disenfranchising constitution passed at the turn of the 20th century, which erected barriers to voter registration. In 1919 The Orangeburg Regional Medical Center opened. This area is also known for its extremely rich soil.

===20th century===

Efforts by blacks to regain civil rights increased in the postwar period after World War II. In the 1960s, Orangeburg was a major center of Civil Rights Movement activities by students from both Claflin College and South Carolina State College as well as black residents of the city. After the US Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) declaring segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional, local blacks sought integration of local schools in 1956. Whites retaliated economically, sometimes firing activists or evicting them from rental housing. College students came to their support with hunger strikes, boycotts, and mass marches. In 1960, over 400 students were arrested on sit-ins and integration marches organized by the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE).

In August 1963, the Orangeburg Freedom Movement (OFM), chaired by Harlowe Caldwell of the NAACP, submitted 10 pro-integration demands to the Orangeburg Mayor and City Council. After negotiations failed, mass demonstrations similar to those in the Birmingham campaign in Alabama resulted in more than 1,300 arrests. Local efforts to end segregation in public places continued, particularly after Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. On February 8, 1968, after days of protests against a segregated bowling alley, violence broke out near the bowling alley as police attacked Black students from South Carolina State. Police opened fire on a crowd of students, killing Samuel Hammond, Henry Smith, and Delano Middleton, and wounding 27 others in what became known as the &quot;Orangeburg Massacre&quot;.

===21st century===
In May 2000, the city created the Orangeburg County Community of Character initiative. It is a collaborative effort in community development by the Downtown Orangeburg Revitalization Association (DORA), &quot;The Times and Democrat&quot; newspaper, the Orangeburg County Chamber of Commerce, and the Orangeburg County Development Commission. In 2005, the National Civic League awarded Orangeburg County the All-America City Award which recognizes and encourages civic excellence. It honors communities in which citizens, government, businesses, and non-profit organizations demonstrate successful resolution of critical community issues.

In 2007, Orangeburg hosted the first Democratic U.S. presidential candidate debate of the campaign season at Martin Luther King Jr. Auditorium on the campus of South Carolina State University; future president Barack Obama was one of the debaters. In 2021, President Joe Biden visited Orangeburg to deliver a commencement address at South Carolina State.

<text>Santee is a town in Orangeburg County along the Santee River Valley in central South Carolina, United States. It has become a resort town of note located centrally north-south along the Atlantic Seaboard of South Carolina. The region has been rural, with a primarily agricultural economy typical of Orangeburg County, but is now known primarily for its several golf courses in proximity to Lake Marion, Santee State Park and other Lake Marion attractions. Interstate 95 connects its attractions easily with tourists traveling by automobile. I-95 crosses a narrow arm of the lake into the town lands, along a causeway. Lake Marion is a man-made hydroelectric reservoir, which at 110,000 acres (450 km2, 173 sq mi) is one of the fifty largest lakes in the country.

The population was 797 at the 2020 census. The town has been undergoing economic and population growth, and development as rural niches are supplanted by bedroom communities.

Construction of the Santee Cooper Regional Water System can provide millions of gallons of potable water per day to the surrounding five counties centered about Santee. The system was coordinated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and funded by the Army Corps of Engineers, USEPA, and the South Carolina Department of Commerce. The plant was completed and operational as of June 1, 2008. Work to connect the plant to the five counties (Berkeley, Orangeburg, Dorchester, Calhoun, and Sumter) is underway and being overseen and funded by the same parties. Currently, the RWS serves the town of Santee, with pipeline rapidly being installed to other locations. Incoming businesses from this project are projected to bring thousands of jobs to the area.

The Lake Marion High School &amp; Technology Center is located in the town.

<text>Central is a town in Pickens County, South Carolina, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 5,159, roughly 3,000 of whom were considered permanent residents. Contrary to its name, it is not near South Carolina&#x27;s center.

Southern Wesleyan University&#x27;s main campus is east of downtown Central.

==History==
Central was founded by the Atlanta and Richmond Air Line Railway in a railroad boom that began in 1873. The town&#x27;s name represents the fact that it is midway between Atlanta and Charlotte. Central was incorporated as a town on March 17, 1875.

In 1897, Southern Railway moved its headquarters from Central to Greenville; trains no longer stopped to change engines, and soon all shops and offices were closed. The establishment of Issaqueena Mill and, in 1906, Wesleyan Methodist Bible Institute (now Southern Wesleyan University) brought people back to the town.

Two buildings on Church Street in Central are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Central High School and Morgan House. The Central Roller Mills on Madden Bridge Road was listed in 2013.

As of 2006, a downtown project is underway that is designed to improve the area&#x27;s aesthetics. There are also many modest pre-World War II homes near the downtown. Central has several large apartment complexes, including The Reserve, which primarily house students from nearby Clemson University (who can use Clemson Area Transit to get there), as well as from Southern Wesleyan University.

<text>Easley is a city in Pickens County (with parts extending into Anderson County) in the U.S. state of South Carolina. Most of the city lies in Pickens County, with a small portion of the city in Anderson County.

In 2001, Easley hosted the Big League World Series for the first time, and continued to host the tournament annually until it was disbanded in 2016. In 2017, the Senior League World Series moved to Easley as the host for the annual tournament. The Upper South Carolina State Fair is located in Easley and is held annually in early September.

==History==

In 1791, Washington District was established by the state legislature out of the former Cherokee territory. Rockville was also created in 1791 but changed to Pickensville in 1792. Pickensville became the district seat of Washington District which was then composed of Greenville and Pendleton Counties. In 1798, Washington District was divided into Greenville and Pendleton Districts. In 1828, Pendleton District was divided further with the lower portion becoming Anderson County and the upper becoming Pickens County named after Andrew Pickens.

Col. Robert Elliott Holcombe became a co-founder of the town by starting off as a farmer and timber mill owner in the area. His farming ventures enabled him to establish the storeroom in 1845 as the first business in the area. The namesake of the town was William King Easley. Easley was born in Pickens County, South Carolina in 1825. Easley and four others from Greenville represented the Greenville area in the South Carolina Secession Convention. When the American Civil War erupted, Easley raised a company of cavalry from Greenville and Pickens counties. During the war, Easley served as a major in the Confederate Army.

After the civil war, Easley became a local attorney and persuaded the Atlanta and Charlotte Air Line Railway to be established through Pickensville by raising $100,000 to invest in the railroad. Holcombe was considered to be the first citizen of Easley, building the first dwelling and train depot in the town from his family&#x27;s lumber mill. Holcombe became the first mayor of the town and was also the first agent of the train depot. The town of Easley was chartered in 1873. At the time, the consensus was that it should be named Holcombe or Holcombetown, but Col. Holcombe said that he didn&#x27;t think Holcombe was a very attractive name and that Easley sounded better. The Pickensville Post Office became Easley Post Office in 1875. The railroad transformed Easley into an industrious and thriving textile town. The Easley Textile Company, later known as Swirl Inc., came to Easley in 1953. The construction of U.S. Route 123 helped establish retail and new business in Easley. On April 25, 1951, a department store was on fire threatening many buildings in downtown Easley but the quick response of the fire department extinguished the fire.

In 1968, NASCAR driver Curtis Turner caused a telephone outage in Easley while landing his airplane on the town&#x27;s main street.

In 2020, longtime fire chief Butch Womack was elected mayor. However, in 2023, Lisa Talbert challenged his reelection, becoming Easley&#x27;s first female mayor when she defeated him.

<text>Liberty is a city in Pickens County, South Carolina, United States. It is part of the Greenville–Mauldin–Easley Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city was chartered on March 2, 1876.

==Toponymy==
How exactly Liberty got its name has been a source of debate over the years. There are no real historical accounts of why Liberty was given the name it was. The most popular—though probably mythical—story regarding the reason the area was named Liberty was put forth by Mrs. Annie Craig in 1936: &quot;At the close of the Revolutionary War a religious meeting was being held at a church close to a spring near the present town of Liberty when the word came that Cornwallis had surrendered and the colonies had gained their independence. This church was named Liberty and it and the spring were located just beyond where the cemetery is now located, hence the name Liberty.&quot;

Some have claimed that Liberty was once named Salubrity Springs, but was renamed Liberty in the late 19th century. References to early land records, however, suggest that such is not the case. While there are many records that refer to the area as Liberty Spring, there are no private or legal documents that contain a reference to Salubrity Spring. The first reference to Salubrity comes from the name of a farm purchased by the Rev. Allen Fuller, Universalist, in 1837. In 1839, Mr. Fuller set up a post office in his home, naming it the Salubrity Post Office. This post office remained in operation until February, 1876, three years after the first official Liberty post office was established in 1873. Once the town of Liberty was chartered a little more than a month after the Salubrity post office closed, the name Salubrity became little more than a memory.

==History==

===Early history (to 1890)===
Liberty today sits on land that was once part of the Cherokee Indians&#x27; hunting ground. The Otarre, or Lower Hill Cherokees, had several thriving villages along the riverbanks in the area; perhaps the most notable example being the village of Keowee, located near the modern day Oconee and Pickens County line. Cherokee tribesmen, who often survived by growing crops, and tended to live in small villages, were in many ways more domesticated than other Native American tribes. The Cherokee also hunted game, believing that the foothills were a sacred hunting ground for deer, buffalo, and other large animals.

Tradition holds that Hernando DeSoto and his group of Spanish explorers were the first Europeans to travel through the area around year 1540. The first Englishmen to venture into the area were traders who often travelled up from Charles Town and Savannah to exchange their guns, horses, cloth, and liquor with the Cherokee for animal skin and fur. In 1753, British colonists built Fort Prince George, the first white settlement in Pickens County. During the American Revolution the Cherokee chose to support the loyalists. South Carolinian patriots, angered at the Cherokee for supporting the Redcoats, forced them to cede much of their territory with the Treaty of DeWitt&#x27;s Corner in 1777. American settlers did not start moving into the area in large numbers until the mid-1780s.

Much of the history of the Liberty area in the late 18th century is unknown. By 1800, Liberty—then called Liberty Spring—was included in the newly formed Pendleton District, which included most of modern-day Anderson, Oconee, and Pickens Counties. During the Antebellum period, most people living in Liberty Spring were subsistence farmers: farmers who grew only what they needed to survive. Few in the area could afford to own slaves like the wealthier planters in the Lowcountry, and almost every farmer was forced to work the land himself. Even for those who wished to trade with other towns, the poor roads made the effort to transport goods cost more than those goods were often worth. Outside of church, residents had few opportunities to socialize with each other. By 1826, the Pendleton District had split up into Pickens and Anderson Districts, with Liberty becoming part of the new Pickens District, which included both Pickens and Oconee Counties.

===The Civil War and Reconstruction Era (1860–1877)===
In 1860, a group of Pickens County delegates went to Columbia, where they—along with every other South Carolina delegate—voted unanimously in favor of South Carolina&#x27;s secession from the Union. Though it is generally accepted that the first shot of the Civil War occurred when the Union ship &quot;Star of the West&quot; was fired upon by state troops at Morris Island on January 9, 1861, an old legend claims that a resident named William Mauldin fired upon the Union ship from Fort Moultrie a few hours earlier, making him the first shot of the War. Either way, what is known is that men from almost every family in the area enlisted to fight for the Confederate cause. Many families lost two, three, or more sons to the war effort. Several companies of infantry and cavalry were formed in Pickens District before being dispatched to serve under one of the state regiments. The men who either refused to enlist or deserted in battle were often thought upon with scorn by their neighbors for the rest of their lives, and even their descendants were often ostracized for years afterward. The women who stayed behind willingly suffered through the whole war by doing without food and supplies that were needed in the war effort.

After the war, Pickens District, like the rest of the South, was placed under martial law by Union troops. With little choice in the matter, South Carolina was readmitted to the Union in 1868. Not long afterwards, Pickens District was separated into the modern day Pickens and Oconee Counties. Between 1865 and 1877, southerners had little control over their government. Gangs of Union troops sacked and looted many farms in Pickens County during this period, known as Reconstruction, and the county and state governments were largely controlled by Northerners who moved South after the war. Reconstruction officially ended in South Carolina around the year 1877, not long after former Confederate General Wade Hampton III was elected governor under the Democratic ticket.

===The Founders&#x27; Era (1876–1900)===
Liberty&#x27;s official recognition as a town came soon after the Charlotte-Atlanta Airline Railway was completed in the early 1870s. Former Confederate General William Easley, a lawyer working for the railroad company, negotiated to have the tracks laid through the southern part of Pickens County. It is along these tracks that the towns of Liberty, Easley, and Central all grew. By 1873, Liberty Station was built north of Liberty Spring after Mrs. Catherine Templeton deeded her land to the railroad company. John T. Boggs set up the new Liberty Post Office that same year, and was named the town&#x27;s first postmaster. Liberty was formally chartered on March 2, 1876, with the future town center being located on the former lands of Mrs. Templeton.

In 1877, James Avenger was appointed the town&#x27;s first marshall. The marshall, a forerunner to today&#x27;s chief of police, was satirized in a &quot;Pickens Sentinel&quot; article that claimed, &quot;there was nothing for him to do, except to look after the cows that go astray.&quot; The town&#x27;s first mayor W.E. Holcombe, a lawyer and former state senator, was elected in 1876. He, like every succeeding mayor until the early 20th century, conducted most municipal business in his own home. Several schools were already in operation by this time, with most being privately funded, and sponsored either by the community or by the local churches. The Liberty First Baptist Church had existed prior to the city&#x27;s founding, being located at the old Liberty Spring site. Reports indicate the Church had a congregation as early as year 1802, when they met at an old log house north of the present-day town. The Liberty Presbyterian Church was built in 1883 at its present site; formerly the church&#x27;s members had worshiped at Mt. Carmel Church in the country.

===The Textile Era (1900–1980)===
Liberty&#x27;s next change came in 1901, when Mr. Jeptha P. Smith organized and started the first cotton mill, which he named the Liberty Mill. The original mill contained a card room and an operating spinning frame. Eighteen houses and two overseer houses were built as a mill village to house the plant&#x27;s workers and their families. The second cotton mill was built by Mr. Lang Clayton of Norris in 1905. Built in a part of town often referred to as Rabbit Town, the plant was originally named the Calumet Mill, and later renamed the Maplecroft Mill. By 1920, both mills had come under the control of Woodside Mills. The first mill became known as Woodside Liberty Plant #1 (commonly called the Big Mill), and the second as Woodside Liberty Plant #2 (commonly called the Little Mill). Woodside Mills operated the plants until 1956, when the company was purchased by Dan River Mills of Virginia. At their height in the 1970s, the mills employed over one thousand workers and housed over one thousand looms. In the 1970s, the Woodside Liberty Mills were the world&#x27;s largest producers of Oxford fabric, a popular fabric of the era. The mills were again purchased in the early 1980s by Greenwood Mills, which maintained control of the mills until local textile industry declined in the 1990s due largely to foreign competition. In 2013 the little mill was demolished. The Big Mill is currently being stripped for demolition.

The growth of cotton mills in the area brought about a major shift in the way people lived. Many migrated away from farmlands to the mill villages, and went from growing food to survive to earning hourly wages in the mills. Though farming was a hard life, early mill life was grueling in its own right; mill workers—condescendingly referred to as &quot;lintheads&quot;—often worked twelve or more hours a day in unventilated rooms. Nevertheless, most workers believed that they were fortunate just to have such work, and willingly worked in the same mills all their lives. In many mill village families, both the husband and wife worked in the same mill.

Outside of the mills, several other major changes also happened during this long time period. Electricity came to Liberty in 1910, when Mr. J. Warren Smith, a salesman, installed two gasoline generators downtown to operate the first street lights and the lights of several shops. By 1928, demand had increased to the point that Mr. Smith decided to sell his assets to Duke Power, which established a small office downtown. The Liberty Fire Department was first established in 1925, with J. Warren Smith—the same man who brought electricity to Liberty—being named as the first fire chief. The Fire Department moved into its present building in 1974. The first town library originated in 1947 as a small room located in the same building as City Hall. The Sarlin Community Library, the one in current use, was built at its present location in 1966. Liberty&#x27;s police department was finally organized in the 1920s, when the city employed a chief of police and two policemen. The first telephone service came to Liberty in 1902, when Southern Bell installed a telephone switchboard in the same building as the post office. The first water plant for the town was built in 1918 on Black Snake Road. This plant initially supplied water to around one hundred homes. This plant was phased out by 1956 after a newer waterworks site was built on Eighteen Mile Creek.

The former Mohawk Carpet plant is currently occupied by Southern Vinyl Windows &amp; Doors, a major employer in the area.

<text>Pickens, formerly called Pickens Courthouse, is a city in and the county seat of Pickens County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 3,126 at the 2010 census. Pickens changed its classification from a town to a city in 1998, but it was not reported to the Census Bureau until 2001. It was named after Andrew Pickens (1739–1817), an American revolutionary soldier and US Congressman for South Carolina.

Pickens is part of the Greenville–Mauldin–Easley Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Present-day Pickens of Pickens County was previously Cherokee Territory. During the American Revolutionary War, the Cherokee sided with the Kingdom of Great Britain. When Great Britain was defeated in the war, the Cherokee were forced to surrender their land. In 1791, the state legislature established Washington District that comprises present-day Greenville, Anderson, Oconee, and Pickens Counties. In 1798 Washington District was divided into Greenville and Pendleton districts. The Pendleton district eventually became Anderson, Oconee, and Pickens County. Pendleton District was divided in 1828 into Anderson and Pickens. A courthouse was established on the banks of the Keowee River where the town of Pickens Court House was developed. The Hagood-Mauldin House was built &quot;circa&quot; 1856 and is one of the historic structures of Pickens County. In 1868, the Pickens District was divided for a final time, into Pickens and Oconee counties. Pickens Court House relocated to its present-day site and was renamed to Pickens.

The Pickens Railway was established in 1898 as a shortline railroad from Easley to Pickens. From 1955 until 1987, Sangamo-Weston Inc. operated a capacitor manufacturing facility just outside Pickens. Until they were banned in the US, Sangamo discharged a significant amount of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) into a tributary of the Twelve Mile River which feeds into Lake Hartwell. Sangamo also dumped contaminated waste in six locations in the vicinity of Pickens. In two of these locations, the waste was burned, forming more dangerous dioxins. According to the &quot;Spartanburg Herald-Journal&quot;, contamination was discovered at the &quot;Breazeale site&quot;, southwest of town. Schlumberger paid $11.8 million to federal and state agencies for injuries to natural resources caused by the contamination.

==Geography and climate==
Pickens is located at (34.881700, -82.707477).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town had a total area of 2.5 square miles (6.4 km2), of which 2.5 square miles (6.3 km2) is land and 0.04 square mile (0.1 km2) (0.81%) is water.

Pickens also has several small mountains that surround the city. Glassy Mountain, located east of Pickens, is a small mountain that can be reached by several small private roads. Glassy Mountain is an excellent example of a piedmont monadnock, which are rare in South Carolina. Sixty-five acres of the mountain are part of the South Carolina Heritage Trust, and contain varied and rare plant species. Perhaps one of the most famous mountains in the area is Table Rock State Park, located just to the north of Pickens, but still in the Pickens area, which has been a symbol for Pickens and can be seen throughout Pickens and nearby cities such as Easley and Greenville. In addition to Table Rock Mountain, the park contains Pinnacle Mountain, the highest mountain contained entirely within the state of South Carolina.
