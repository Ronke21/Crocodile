<text>Wallace is a town in Codington County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 91 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Watertown, South Dakota Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The town was named for the original owner of the town site. Wallace is the birthplace of Hubert Humphrey, the Vice President of the United States from 1965 to 1969.

Hubert Humphrey was born in a room over his father&#x27;s drugstore in Wallace. He was the son of Ragnild Kristine Sannes (1883–1973), a Norwegian immigrant, and Hubert Horatio Humphrey Sr. (1882–1949). Humphrey spent most of his youth in nearby Doland, a town with a population of approximately 600. His father was a licensed pharmacist and merchant who served as mayor and a town council member; he also served briefly in the South Dakota state legislature and was a South Dakota delegate to the 1944 and 1948 Democratic National Conventions. In the late 1920s, a severe economic downturn hit Doland; both of the town&#x27;s banks closed and Humphrey&#x27;s father struggled to keep his store open.

After his son graduated from Doland High School, Hubert Sr. left the area and opened a new drugstore in the larger town of Huron (population 11,000), where he hoped to improve his fortunes.

<text>Buffalo Gap (Lakota: &quot;pté tȟathíyopa otȟúŋwahe&quot;; &quot;buffalo gap village&quot;) is a town in Custer County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 131 at the 2020 census.

==History==
A very old western South Dakota town, Buffalo Gap was founded in 1877. By 1885, it was a railroad spur for the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad line, with more than 1,200 residents. Today, the town has about 180 residents.

In its early years it was one of the largest towns in South Dakota, but it received the same fate as many other towns of that era. A resident&#x27;s cow kicked over a lantern and it burned the town to the ground, as happened with the Great Chicago Fire and many others. The town never fully recovered and was never rebuilt to its former grandeur.

The name comes from a gap to the west of town that sheltered buffalo herds in earlier times. Although Buffalo Gap burned down several times, there are a number of historic buildings still standing. Located on State Hwy 79 between Hermosa and Hot Springs, Buffalo Gap intersects with County Road 656, an “off the beaten path” that travelers can take into the Buffalo Gap National Grasslands, Badlands National Park and the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation
Part of the action of the French book &quot;La Brèche aux buffles&quot; takes place in Buffalo Gap.

<text>Custer is a city in Custer County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 1,919 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Custer County.

==History==

Custer is the oldest town established by European Americans in the Black Hills. Gold was discovered east of Custer during the Black Hills Expedition, conducted by the 7th Cavalry led by Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer, a discovery which initiated the Black Hills Gold Rush.

For thousands of years, the Black Hills had been part of the territory of varying tribes of indigenous peoples. They were within historical territory of the Oglala Sioux at the time of United States encounter, and within the Great Sioux Reservation established by the US Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868). Having established dominance in the area by the eighteenth century, the Oglala Sioux had long considered the Black Hills as sacred land.

After increasing encroachment by Americans and violent confrontations, the U.S. government forced the Sioux to cede much of the Black Hills in 1877, and opened the land for individual purchase and settlement. In 1875 trespassing gold-boomers named their settlement Stonewall (after the Confederate general, Stonewall Jackson), but it was renamed for Custer. Almost abandoned in 1876 after word of the much larger gold strikes in Deadwood Gulch spread, Custer later became an established city.

Custer has had a smaller population and been less wealthy than the Northern Hills cities of Deadwood and Lead. In addition to gold, Custer and other cities based their economies on the extraction of industrial minerals, which are still important to the regional economy.

Custer annually observes a &quot;Gold Discovery Days&quot; celebration and festivities over the last full weekend of July. This heritage tourism event celebrates the embezzlement of gold by the Custer expedition in nearby French Creek and the subsequent founding of the town.

===Climate===
Custer has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;/&quot;Dwb&quot;) with summers featuring very warm afternoons and cool mornings, and cold, extremely variable winters.

Winter weather is dominated by the conflict between cold Arctic air moving south from Canada, and very warm chinook winds which can produce exceptionally high winter temperatures for the latitude and altitude. For instance, January 19 of 1963 saw the coldest temperature ever of , yet in just over two weeks on February 5, Custer reached .

The frequent chinooks limit snow cover: even in January the mean is only . The most snow on the ground in Custer has been on April 15, 1927.

Custer&#x27;s altitude makes summers much milder than in the Great Plains proper: only seven afternoons rise above and has been reached only once in 1954. The transitional spring season is similarly variable to the winter: as much as of snow fell in April 1920 – the snowiest month on record – but has been reached as early as March 15 of 2003 and as early as April 21, 1989. Most precipitation falls from spring and early summer thunderstorms: of the of precipitation expected each year, can be expected from April to July.

<text>Pringle is a town in Custer County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 109 at the 2020 census.

The town is named for W. H. Pringle, a cattleman who lived in the area.

==Geography==
Pringle got its start as a stage stop on the Sidney-Custer Trail. Operated by Henry Pringle, it was called the Point of Rocks Stage Station, named after a prominent and distinct granite outcropping located due east of the current town.

The Sidney-Custer Trail was an important route into the southern Black Hills from Nebraska, and The Point of Rocks Station also served traffic between Cheyenne, Wyoming and Custer.

A small settlement, also called Point of Rocks, soon developed around the stage station. In 1890, the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad track reached the settlement, at which time the town&#x27;s name was changed to Pringle, named after Anna Carr Pringle, who provided hospitality to the railroad crews when they came through town. The settlement soon boasted a railroad depot and two stores.

Pringle is most famous as the home of a housing complex devoted to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The development continues to grow and spark controversy in the area.

==Attractions==

Mitchell is home of the Corn Palace. The Corn Palace is decorated with several colors of dried corn and grains, creating murals. The theme of the external murals is changed yearly at fall harvest; internal murals are changed approximately every ten years. The building itself is used for several purposes including a basketball arena, the local high school prom, trade shows, staged entertainment, and the Shriner&#x27;s Circus.

Mitchell is also the home of the Dakota Discovery Museum, whose mission is to present and preserve the history of the prairie and the people who settled it. The museum covers the time period from 1600, when the Native Americans were still largely undiscovered, to 1939, the end of the Great Depression. The museum holds one of the most complete and pristine collections of American Indian quill and bead-works. The Dakota Discovery Museum also features artists such as Harvey Dunn, James Earle Fraser, Charles Hargens and Oscar Howe. In the village area behind the main building are four authentic historical buildings, including an 1885 one-room school house and the fully furnished 1886 Victorian-Italianate home of the co-founder of the Corn Palace, Louis Beckwith. Two new features of the museum are Discovery Land, a hands-on activity area for children ages five to ten, and the Heritage Gardens Project, which brings indigenous plants to the gardens surrounding the museum and historical buildings.

The Mitchell Prehistoric Indian Village, an archaeological site where scientists are excavating a Native American village, is another attraction in the city. The site, near Lake Mitchell, is believed to have been occupied by ancestors of the present-day Mandan, who now reside in North Dakota. The excavation is unique in that it is enclosed by an Archeodome, a climate-controlled building built over the site, which allows scientists to continue their excavation work year-round.

The Mitchell area also boasts several state champion trees: Black Cherry, Black Locust, Siberian Elm, and Tulip Tree.

Mitchell was featured in the seventeenth episode of the Small Town News Podcast, an improv comedy podcast that takes listeners on a fun and silly virtual trip to a small town in America each week, in which the hosts improvise scenes inspired by local newspaper stories.

<doc id="134811" wikidata="Q2481965" url="?curid=134811" title="Lily, South Dakota">
<text>Lily is a former town in Day County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 4 at the 2010 census. The town was dissolved in March 2017 by the Day County court due to the population reaching zero.

==History==
Lily was a depot served by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad from 1898 until 1979. The town was named by its first postmaster, Ross Parks, after his sister, Lily. Mr. Parks and his sister homesteaded here in 1883. The post office is dated July 13, 1883.

==Notable people==
In 1889 Vice President Hubert Humphrey’s maternal grandfather, Andrew Gutorm Sannes, settled his family in Lily. With his wife, Tomina Larson, and five children (including Kristine - b. 1883, Norway, mother of the future vice president), they moved here, where they had 6 more children. Andrew Sannes, an immigrant Norwegian sea captain (with the dashed dream of being a Mississippi River boat captain), opened a drugstore in the corner of the general store. Their third child, Sophia, was their first-borne in the U.S., in Lily (December 1891); and their last child born in Lily was Thorvald, on September 18, 1900.

Hubert Humphrey, Sr., after graduating from the Drew School of Pharmacy in Minneapolis, Minnesota, moved to Lily in 1903 and opened his first drugstore. (Today a small white sign cryptically marks the empty corner lot where the store had stood.) Here, he met Kristine Sannes, the woman who would become his wife. They married on April 16, 1906, in Lily.

In 1907 they moved to Wallace, South Dakota, where Hubert Humphrey, Jr., the notable politician, was born on May 27, 1911, in a bedroom over his father’s drugstore. Hubert Humphrey, Jr., states, &quot;I was baptized in the Highland Lutheran church in a rural section just north of Lily, South Dakota.&quot;

In 2010, a video detailing the history of Lily was created by the McQuillen Creative Group. This video Memories of Lily - A Letter to Oprah submitted to Oprah Winfrey (who sponsored the contest to raise awareness of rural towns) depicts the essence of current day Lily.

“Roslyn received its name from Old Roslyn, which was a post office and trading point established in 1882. H.H. Russell, the first postmaster, took the name Roslyn from his native city in Scotland.” Another source states the name Roslyn is an amalgamation of Rosholt and Lynn, the names of two lakes near the town site.

“In 1914, the Soo Line Railroad (Fairmount and Veblen Railway) was being built in the area. In order to secure the line for the community, settlers adjoining the proposed line raised $60,000. The coming of the railroad led to the selection of a new town site. On August 17, 1914, the New Roslyn was plotted and Main Street was established.” Old Roslyn was eventually abandoned.

<text>A model rocket is a small rocket designed to reach low altitudes (e.g., for a model) and be recovered by a variety of means.

According to the United States National Association of Rocketry (NAR)&#x27;s Safety Code, model rockets are constructed out of lightweight and non metallic parts. The materials are typically paper, cardboard, balsa wood or plastic. The code also provides guidelines for motor use, launch site selection, launch methods, launcher placement, recovery system design and deployment and more. Since the early 1960s, a copy of the Model Rocket Safety Code has been provided with most model rocket kits and motors. Despite its inherent association with extremely flammable substances and objects with a pointed tip traveling at high speeds, model rocketry historically has proven to be a very safe hobby and has been credited as a significant source of inspiration for children who have eventually become scientists and engineers.

== History of model rocketry ==
While there were many small and rockets produced after years of research and experimentation, the first modern model rocket, and more importantly, the model rocket motor, was designed in 1954 by Orville Carlisle, a licensed pyrotechnics expert, and his brother Robert, a model airplane enthusiast. They originally designed the motor and rocket for Robert to use in lectures on the principles of rocket-powered flight. But then Orville read articles written in &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; by G. Harry Stine about the safety problems associated with young people trying to make their own rocket engines. With the launch of Sputnik, many young people were trying to build their own rocket motors, often with tragic results. Some of these attempts were dramatized in the fact-based 1999 film &quot;October Sky&quot;. The Carlisles realized their motor design could be marketed and provide a safe outlet for a new hobby. They sent samples to Mr. Stine in January 1957. Stine, a range safety officer at White Sands Missile Range, built and flew the models, and then devised a safety handbook for the activity based on his experience at the range.

The first American model rocket company was Model Missiles Incorporated (MMI), in Denver, Colorado, opened by Stine and others. Stine had model rocket engines made by a local fireworks company recommended by Carlisle, but reliability and delivery problems forced Stine to approach others. Stine eventually approached Vernon Estes, the son of a local fireworks maker. Estes founded Estes Industries in 1958 in Denver, Colorado and developed a high-speed automated machine for manufacturing solid model rocket motors for MMI. The machine, nicknamed &quot;Mabel&quot;, made low-cost motors with great reliability, and did so in quantities much greater than Stine needed. Stine&#x27;s business faltered and this enabled Estes to market the motors separately. Subsequently, he began marketing model rocket kits in 1960, and eventually, Estes dominated the market. Estes moved his company to Penrose, Colorado in 1961. Estes Industries was acquired by Damon Industries in 1970. It continues to operate in Penrose today.

Competitors like Centuri and Cox came and went in America during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, but Estes continued to control the American market, offering discounts to schools and clubs like Boy Scouts of America to help grow the hobby. In recent years, companies like Quest Aerospace have taken a small portion of the market, but Estes continues to be the main source of rockets, motors, and launch equipment for the low- to medium-power rocketry hobby today. Estes produces and sells black powder rocket motors.

Since the advent of high-power rocketry, which began in the mid-1980s with the availability of G- through J-class motors (each letter designation has up to twice the energy of the one before), a number of companies have shared the market for larger and more powerful rockets. By the early 1990s, Aerotech Consumer Aerospace, LOC/Precision, and Public Missiles Limited (PML) had taken up leadership positions, while a host of engine manufacturers provided ever larger motors, and at much higher costs. Companies like Aerotech, Vulcan, and Kosdon were widely popular at launches during this time as high-power rockets routinely broke Mach 1 and reached heights over . In a span of about five years, the largest regularly made production motors available reached N, which had the equivalent power of over 1,000 D engines combined, and could lift rockets weighing with ease. Custom motor builders continue to operate on the periphery of the market today, often creating propellants that produce colored flame (red, blue, and green being common), black smoke and sparking combinations, as well as occasionally building enormous motors of P, Q, and even R class for special projects such as extreme-altitude attempts over .

High-power motor reliability was a significant issue in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with catastrophic engine failures occurring relatively frequently (est. 1 in 20) in motors of L class or higher. At costs exceeding $300 per motor, the need to find a cheaper and more reliable alternative was apparent. Reloadable motor designs (metal sleeves with screwed-on end caps and filled with cast propellant slugs) were introduced by Aerotech and became very popular over the span of a few years. These metal containers needed only to be cleaned and refilled with propellant and a few throw-away components after each launch. The cost of a &quot;reload&quot; was typically half of a comparable single use motor. While catastrophes at take-off (CATOs) still occur occasionally with reloadable motors (mostly due to poor assembly techniques by the user), the reliability of launches has risen significantly.

It is possible to change the thrust profile of solid-propellant motors by selecting different propellant designs. Since thrust is proportional to burning surface area, propellant slugs can be shaped to produce very high thrust for a second or two, or to have a lower thrust that continues for an extended time. Depending on the weight of the rocket and the maximum speed threshold of the airframe and fins, appropriate motor choices can be used to maximize performance and the chance of successful recovery.

Aerotech, Cesaroni, Rouse-Tech, Loki and others have standardized around a set of common reload sizes such that customers have great flexibility in their hardware and reload selections, while there continues to be an avid group of custom engine builders who create unique designs and occasionally offer them for sale.

==Precautions and safety==
Model rocketry is a safe and widespread hobby. Individuals such as G. Harry Stine and Vernon Estes helped to ensure this by developing and publishing the NAR Model Rocket Safety Codes and by commercially producing safe, professionally designed and manufactured model rocket motors. The safety code is a list of guidelines and is only mandatory for National Association of Rocketry members.

A primary motivation for the development of the hobby in the 1950s and 1960s was to enable young people to make flying rocket models without having to construct the dangerous motor units or directly handle explosive propellants.

The NAR and the TRA successfully sued the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives(BATFE) over the classification of Ammonium Perchlorate Composite Propellant (APCP), the most commonly used propellant in high-power rocket motors, as an explosive. The March 13, 2009 decision by DC District court judge Reggie Walton removed APCP from the list of regulated explosives, essentially eliminating BATFE regulation of hobby rocketry.

==Model rocket motors==
Most small model rocket motors are single-use engines, with cardboard bodies and lightweight molded clay nozzles, ranging in impulse class from fractional A to G. Model rockets generally use commercially manufactured black-powder motors. These motors are tested and certified by the National Association of Rocketry, the Tripoli Rocketry Association (TRA) or the Canadian Association of Rocketry (CAR). Black-powder motors come in impulse ranges from 1/8A to F.

The physically largest black-powder model rocket motors are typically F-class, as black powder is very brittle. If a large black-powder motor is the upper stage motor of a rocket that exceeds the maximum recommended takeoff weight, or is dropped or exposed to many heating/cooling cycles (e.g., in a closed vehicle exposed to high heat or a storage area with inconsistent temperature control), the propellant charge may develop hairline fractures. These fractures increase the surface area of the propellant, so that when the motor is ignited, the propellant burns much faster and produces greater than normal internal chamber pressure inside the engine. This pressure may exceed the strength of the paper case and cause the motor to burst. A bursting motor can cause damage to the model rocket ranging from a simple ruptured motor tube or body tube to the violent ejection (and occasionally ignition) of the recovery system.

Therefore, rocket motors with power ratings higher than D to F customarily use composite propellants made of ammonium perchlorate, aluminium powder, and a rubbery binder substance contained in a hard plastic case. This type of propellant is similar to that used in the solid rocket boosters of the Space Shuttle and is not as fragile as black powder, increasing motor reliability and resistance to fractures in the propellant. These motors 
range in impulse from size A to O. Composite motors produce more impulse per unit weight (specific impulse) than do black-powder motors.

Reloadable composite-propellant motors are also available. These are commercially produced motors requiring the user to assemble propellant grains, o-rings and washers (to contain the expanding gases), delay grains and ejection charges into special non-shattering aluminum motor casings with screw-on or snap-in ends (closures). The advantage of a reloadable motor is the cost: firstly, because the main casing is reusable, reloads cost significantly less than single-use motors of the same impulse. Secondly, assembly of larger composite engines is labor-intensive and difficult to automate; off-loading this task on the consumer results in a cost savings. Reloadable motors are available from D through O class.

Motors are electrically ignited with an electric match consisting of a short length of pyrogen-coated nichrome, copper, or aluminum bridgewire pushed into the nozzle and held in place with flameproof wadding, a rubber band, a plastic plug or masking tape. On top of the propellant is a tracking delay charge, which produces smoke but in essence no thrust, as the rocket slows down and arcs over. When the delay charge has burned through, it ignites an ejection charge, which is used to deploy the recovery system.

Model rocket motors mostly don&#x27;t offer any sort of thrust vectoring, instead just relying on fins at the base to keep the vehicle aerodynamically stable. Some rockets do however have thrust vectoring control (TVC) by gimbaling the motor itself rather than the nozzle. This is done on some rockets built by many model rocket builders, the most notable of which is BPS.space.

==Performance==
The impulse (area under the thrust-time curve) of a model motor is used to determine its class. Motors are divided into classes from 1/4A to O and beyond. Black powder rocket motors are typically only manufactured up to Class F. Each class&#x27;s upper limit is double the upper limit of the previous class.
Model rockets only use motors that are class G and below. Rockets using motors with a greater impulse are considered high power rockets.

Figures from tests of Estes rocket motors are used in the following examples of rocket motor performance.

For miniature black powder rocket motors (13 mm diameter), the maximum thrust is between 5 and 12 N, the total impulse is between .5 and 2.2 Ns, and the burn time is between .25 and 1 second. For Estes ‘regular size’ rocket motors (18 mm diameter), there are three classes: A, B, and C. The A class 18 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 9.5 and 9.75 N, a total impulse between 2.1 and 2.3 Ns, and a burn time between .5 and .75 seconds. The B class 18 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 12.15 and 12.75 N, a total impulse between 4.2 and 4.35 Ns, and a burn time between .85 and 1 second. The C class 18mm motors have a maximum thrust from 14 – 14.15 N, a total impulse between 8.8 and 9 Ns, and a burn time between 1.85 and 2 seconds.

There are also 3 classes included in Estes large (24 mm diameter) rocket motors: C, D, and E. The C class 24 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 21.6 and 21.75 N, a total impulse of between 8.8 and 9 Ns, and a burn time between .8 and .85 seconds. The D class 24 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 29.7 and 29.8 N, a total impulse between 16.7 and 16.85 Ns, and a burn time between 1.6 and 1.7 seconds. The E class 24 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 19.4 and 19.5 N, a total impulse between 28.45 and 28.6 Ns, and a burn time between 3 and 3.1 seconds. Estes has also released a line of 29mm black powder E and F motors. The 29mm E produces 33.4 Newton-seconds of total impulse over a 2.1 second burn, and the F produces 49.6 Newton-seconds over a 3.45 second burn.

Several independent sources have published measurements showing that Estes model rocket engines often fail to meet their published thrust specifications.

==Motor nomenclature==
Model rocket motors produced by companies like Estes Industries, Centuri Engineering and Quest Aerospace are stamped with a code (such as A10-3T or B6-4) that indicates several things about the motor.

The Quest Micro Maxx engines are the smallest at a diameter of 6mm. The company Apogee Components made 10.5mm micro motors, however, those were discontinued in 2001. Estes manufactures size &quot;T&quot; (Tiny) motors that are 13 mm in diameter by 45 mm long from 1/4A through A class, while standard A, B and C motors are 18 mm in diameter by 70 mm long. C, D, and E class black-powder motors are also available; they are 24 mm in diameter and either 70 (C and D motors) or 95 mm long (E motors). Estes also produces a line of 29mm diameter by 114mm length E and F class black powder motors. Larger composite propellant motors, such as F and G single-use motors, are also 29mm in diameter. High-power motors (usually reloadable) are available in 29mm, 38mm, 54mm, 75mm, and 98mm diameters.

===First letter===

The letter at the beginning of the code indicates the motor&#x27;s total impulse range (commonly measured in newton-seconds). Each letter in successive alphabetical order has up to twice the impulse of the letter preceding it. This does not mean that a given &quot;C&quot; motor has twice the total impulse of a given &quot;B&quot; motor, only that C motors are in the 5.01-10.0 N-s range while &quot;B&quot; motors are in the 2.51-5.0 N-s range. The designations &quot;¼A&quot; and &quot;½A&quot; are also used. For a more complete discussion of the letter codes, see Model rocket motor classification.

For instance, a B6-4 motor from Estes-Cox Corporation has a total impulse rating of 5.0 N-s. A C6-3 motor from Quest Aerospace has a total impulse of 8.5 N-s.

===First number===

The number that comes after the letter indicates the motor&#x27;s average thrust, measured in newtons. A higher thrust will result in higher liftoff acceleration, and can be used to launch a heavier model. Within the same letter class, a higher average thrust also implies a shorter burn time (e.g., a B6 motor will not burn as long as - but will have more initial thrust than - a B4). Motors within the same letter class that have different first numbers are usually for rockets with different weights. For example, a heavier rocket would require an engine with more initial thrust to get it off of the launch pad, whereas a lighter rocket would need less initial thrust and would sustain a longer burn, reaching higher altitudes.

===Last number===

The last number is the delay in seconds between the end of the thrust phase and ignition of the ejection charge. Black Powder Motors that end in a zero have no delay or ejection charge. Such motors are typically used as first-stage motors in multistage rockets as the lack of delay element and cap permit burning material to burst forward and ignite an upper-stage motor.

A &quot;P&quot; indicates that the motor is &quot;plugged&quot;. In this case, there is no ejection charge, but a cap is in place. A plugged motor is used in rockets that do not need to deploy a standard recovery system such as small rockets that tumble or R/C glider rockets. Plugged motors are also used in larger rockets, where electronic altimeters or timers are used to trigger the deployment of the recovery system.

Composite motors usually have a letter or combination of letters after the delay length, indicating which of the manufacturer&#x27;s different propellant formulations (resulting in colored flames or smoke) is used in that particular motor.

===Reloadable motors===

Reloadable rocket motors are specified in the same manner as single-use model rocket motors as described above. However, they have an additional designation that specifies both the diameter and maximum total impulse of the motor casing in the form of diameter/impulse. After that, there is a series of letters indicating the propellant type. However, not all companies that produce reloadable motors use the same designations for their motors.

An Aerotech reload designed for a 29-millimeter-diameter case with a maximum total impulse of 60 newton-seconds carries the designation 29/60 in addition to its impulse specification.

However, Cesaroni Technology Incorporated (CTI) motors use a different designation. They first have &quot;Pro&quot; followed by a number representing the diameter of the motor in millimeters, for example, a Pro38 motor is a 38mm diameter motor. After this, there is a new string of characters such that the impulse in newton-seconds is first, followed by the motor classification, the average thrust in newtons, followed by a dash, and the delay time in seconds. For example, a Pro29 110G250-14 is a G-motor with 110 Ns of impulse, 250 N of thrust, and a 14-second delay.

==Model rocket recovery methods==
Model and high-power rockets are designed to be safely recovered and flown repeatedly. The most common recovery methods are parachute and streamer. The parachute is usually blown out by the engine&#x27;s ejection charge, which pops off the nose cone. The parachute is attached to the nose cone, making it pull the parachute out and make a soft landing.

===Featherweight recovery===

The simplest approach, which is appropriate only for the tiniest of rockets, is to let the rocket flutter back to the ground after ejecting the motor. This is slightly different from tumble recovery, which relies on some system to destabilize the rocket to prevent it from entering a ballistic trajectory on its way back to Earth.

===Tumble recovery===

Another simple approach appropriate for small rockets — or rockets with a large cross-sectional area — is to have the rocket tumble back to Earth. Any rocket that will enter a stable, ballistic trajectory as it falls is not safe to use with tumble recovery. To prevent this, some such rockets use the ejection charge to slide the engine to the rear of the rocket, moving the center of mass behind the center of pressure and thus making the rocket unstable.

===Nose-blow recovery===

Another very simple recovery technique, used in very early models in the 1950s and occasionally in modern examples, is nose-blow recovery. This is where the ejection charge of the motor ejects the nose cone of the rocket (usually attached by a shock cord made of rubber, Kevlar string or another type of cord) from the body tube, destroying the rocket&#x27;s aerodynamic profile, causing highly increased drag, and reducing the rocket&#x27;s airspeed to a safe rate for landing. Nose-blow recovery is generally only suitable for very light rockets.

===Parachute/Streamer===
The parachute/streamer approach is used most often in small model rockets, but can also be used with larger rockets. It uses the ejective force of the motor to deploy, or push out, the parachute or streamer. The parachute is attached to the body either directly, by means of a ripcord, or indirectly, when it&#x27;s attached to the nose cone, which attached to the body by a ripcord. Typically, a ball or mass of fireproof paper or material, sometimes referred to as recovery wadding, is inserted into the body before the parachute or streamer. This allows the ejection charge to propel the wadding, parachute, and nose cone without damaging the recovery equipment. Air resistance slows the rocket&#x27;s fall, ending in a smooth, controlled and gentle landing.

===Glide recovery===

In glide recovery, the ejection charge either deploys an airfoil (wing) or separates a glider from the motor. If properly trimmed, the rocket/glider will enter a spiral glide and return safely. BnB Rockets &quot;Boost Glider&quot; Is a perfect example of a gliding recovery system. In some cases, radio-controlled rocket gliders are flown back to the earth by a pilot in much the way as R/C model airplanes are flown.

Some rockets (typically long thin rockets) are the proper proportions to safely glide to Earth tail-first. These are termed &#x27;backsliders&#x27;.

===Helicopter recovery===

The ejection charge, through one of several methods, deploys helicopter-style blades and the rocket autorotates back to earth. The helicopter recovery usually happens when the engine&#x27;s recoil creates pressure, making the nose cone pop out. There are rubber bands connected to the nosecone and three or more blades. The rubber bands pull the blades out and they provide enough drag to soften the landing.
In some rockets, the fins are used as the blades as well. In these, the ejection charge pushes a tube inside that has tabs sticking out of the rocket that hold the fins during launch. Then the tab releases the rubber band-pulled fins than pivot up into helicopter position.

===Propulsive recovery===

A very small number of people have been pursuing propulsive landing to recover their model rockets using active control through thrust vectoring. The most notable example of this is Joe Barnard&#x27;s rockets such as &quot;Echo&quot; and the &quot;Scout&quot; series of rockets as part of the BPS.Space project. In 2022, BPS.Space successfully landed the Scout F Model Rocket with plume impingement throttling. In 2023, Teddy Duncker&#x27;s TTB Aerospace successfully landed the LLL Model Rocket.

==Instrumentation==

===Aerial photography===

Cameras and video cameras can be launched on model rockets to take aerial photographs in-flight. These photographs can be taken in many ways. Mechanized timers can be used or passive methods may be employed, such as strings that are pulled by flaps that respond to wind resistance. Microprocessor controllers and altimeters can also be used. However, the rocket&#x27;s speed and motion can lead to blurry photographs, and quickly changing lighting conditions as the rocket points from ground to sky can affect video quality. Video frames can also be stitched together to create panoramas. As parachute systems can be prone to failure or malfunction, model rocket cameras need to be protected from impact with the ground.

The first commercially available system was the Estes CAMROC in 1965. This system used a 1.5 inch round film negative held in a large pill-shaped camera body with the lens facing forwards. It would take a single photograph after apogee as the rocket deployed its parachute. The hobbyist would then send the negatives back to Estes for developing and printing.

The second system was also released by Estes in 1970. Created by Mike Dorfler, the CINEROC held 20 seconds of Super 8mm film that ran at 30 fps, making for a slow-motion effect. Like the CAMROC negatives, these special movie cartridges needed to be shipped back to Estes to be processed.

In 1979, Estes released the Astrocam 110, the first single frame camera rocket that took multiple single shot pictures (one per flight) using standard Kodak 110 cartridge film. Unlike its CAMROC predecessor, it could use color film, and did not require sending the film back to Estes for processing. It did require asking the processor to &#x27;flip&#x27; the negative before printing, as the camera used a mirror to take its pictures. Otherwise, you were directed to hold prints up to a mirror to see them in the correct attitude. Through the 1980s and into the early 2000s, the Astrocam 110 was revised and updated, originally as a kit where you built the camera, which became one with a pre-built camera, then an Almost Ready to Fly model such as the Astrocam RTF and finally the renamed Snapshot RTF. By the mid 2000s, these models had been retired, as the first digital video cameras started to appear on the market. With Kodak ending 110 film production, only specialty film producers make the ASA400 film needed for these cameras, such as the Austrian based Lomography Company.

In 2005 the Oracle Video Rocket, and in 2007 the AstroVision digital/video camera were released by Estes. Both systems were capable of recording a flight from start to finish, but required downloading after each flight, as expandable memory had not been incorporated into them. The AstroVision did have a snapshot mode, so it could do more than a single flight and take multiple pictures, but movie mode was a single take before needing to be attached to a laptop. Both models were discontinued by 2010. A major reason for this was the advent of the &#x27;Key-Fob camera&#x27; - many of which were more powerful, lighter and easier to attach to any rocket, and did not need a specific model to do so, and had expandable memory in the form of Mini SD cards, and were much less expensive. These devices also have the advantage of rechargeable batteries, and since they were built on the same plug-and-play technology Flash Drives use, do not need any extra drivers installed into a computer for them to work. In 2020, Estes brought out a new Key-Fob based camera, which now bears the Astrocam name. As of 2024, two versions can be found - a full rocket kit whose nose cone has a mount for the fob, and the Universal Astrocam, which has the fob along with a holding mount that allows for the camera to ride other models. 

In the area of higher powered rocketry, there are also experimental homemade rockets that include onboard video cameras, with multiple methods for shooting videos. One is to transmit a signal down to a receiver, like in the BoosterVision series of cameras. The second method for this is to record it on board and be downloaded after recovery, the method employed by the Estes cameras listed above. (Some experimenters use the Aiptek PenCam Mega for this, the lowest power usable with this method is a C or D Motor).

=== Instrumentation and experimentation ===

Model rockets with electronic altimeters can report and or record electronic data such as maximum speed, acceleration, and altitude. Two methods of determining these quantities are to a) have an accelerometer and a timer and work backwards from the acceleration to the speed and then to the height and b) to have a barometer on board with a timer and to get the height (from the difference of the pressure on the ground to the pressure in the air) and to work forwards with the time of the measurements to the speed and acceleration.

Rocket modelers often experiment with rocket sizes, shapes, payloads, multistage rockets, and recovery methods. Some rocketeers build scale models of larger rockets, space launchers, or missiles.

==High-power rocketry==
As with low-power model rockets, high-power rockets are also constructed from lightweight materials. Unlike model rockets, high-power rockets often require stronger materials such as fiberglass to withstand the higher stresses during flights that often exceed speeds of Mach 1 (340 m/s) and over altitude.
Because of the potential risk to other aircraft, coordination with proper authorities is often required.

High-power rockets are propelled by larger motors ranging from class H to class O, and/or weigh more than 3.3 lbs or 1,500 grams at liftoff. Their motors are almost always reloadable rather than single-use, in order to reduce cost. Recovery and/or multi-stage ignition may be initiated by small on-board computers, which use an altimeter or accelerometer for detecting when to ignite engines or deploy parachutes.

High-power model rockets can carry large payloads, including cameras and instrumentation such as GPS units.

===Differences from model rocketry===
A high-power rocket is typically:

*The rocket weighs more than 1,500 grams
*The rocket is rarely made out of metallic and high performance materials, such as Aluminum and carbon fiber, as this is against industry safety standards required by National Association of Rocketry and Tripoli. Instead, fiberglass is often used in order to withstand the rigors of high power motors and flight.
*The motor used contains more than 125 grams of propellant
*The motor used has an impulse of more than 160 Newton-seconds (is an H-class or above) or uses multiple motors with a total impulse of more than 320 Newton-seconds.
*Exact requirements vary from one jurisdiction to another.

Despite the scale of the damage, only nine people were injured and no one was killed. In June 2015, the mayor said that half of the town&#x27;s residents would not come back and rebuild. According to the 2020 census, the population declined to 153 from 234 in 2010, a decline of 34.6%, which is a smaller decline than anticipated.

A new Zion Lutheran Church was later rebuilt close to the site of the damaged building and dedicated in August 2017. Several parts of the previous building including the altar were saved and used in the new building.

<text>Hot Springs (Lakota: &quot;mni kȟáta&quot;; &quot;hot water&quot;) is a city in and county seat of Fall River County, South Dakota, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 3,395. In addition, neighboring Oglala Lakota County contracts the duties of Auditor, Treasurer and Register of Deeds to the Fall River County authority in Hot Springs.

==Geography==
Hot Springs is located in Fall River County at the southern edge of South Dakota&#x27;s Black Hills. The Fall River runs through the city.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==History==

The Sioux and Cheyenne people had long frequented the area, appreciating its warm springs. According to several accounts, including a ledger art piece by the Oglala Lakota artist Amos Bad Heart Bull, Native Americans considered the springs sacred.
European settlers arrived in the second half of the 19th century. They first named the city &quot;Minnekahta&quot; after its Lakota name. It was renamed Hot Springs in 1882, which is a translation of the Native American name. A variety of health resorts were built on the tourism offered by the springs.

==Tourism==

Attractions in the Hot Springs area include The Mammoth Site, which boasts the world&#x27;s largest collection of mammoth bones. Along with that are natural natural hot spring destinations, like Moccasin Springs Spa and Evans Plunge, built in 1890, with its naturally warm spring water. The town is also a gateway to the attractions of the southern Black Hills, particularly Wind Cave National Park. Hot Springs holds the annual Miss South Dakota pageant. In recognition of its historic value, the National Trust for Historic Preservation listed Hot Springs as one of its 2009 Dozen Distinctive Destinations. The city center contains over 35 sandstone buildings.

The Angostura Reservoir, a 4,407 acres (17.83 km2) lake is located 10 miles southeast of the city and is a popular fishing, camping, and recreation area. Cold Brook Dam, which creates Cold Brook Lake is a 36-acre lake is located just north of the city, and Cottonwood Springs Dam and lake is located about 5 miles west.

Hot Springs is also the home of a United States Department of Veterans Affairs hospital (Black Hills Healthcare System - Hot Springs Campus), which was designated in 2011 as a National Historic Landmark. Formerly known as the Battle Mountain Sanitarium, the 100-bed center was built in 1907 for patients with rheumatism or tuberculosis. In the early 21st century, it offers extensive outpatient treatment, acute hospital care, PTSD treatment, and an alcohol and drug treatment facility. The Battle Mountain Sanitarium was declared a National Treasure by the National Trust for Historic Preservation following a December 2011 proposal announced by the Department of Veterans Affairs to close the facility. Community and state leaders, including Senator Tim Johnson, Senator John Thune, and Representative Kristi Noem opposed the closing. A concerned group of veterans and citizens organized a &quot;Save the VA&quot; Campaign; they have countered the VA&#x27;s proposal based on the results of multiple Freedom of Information Act requests, getting as far as meeting with Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki to show how they believe VA leadership manipulated data to justify the proposed closure of the Landmark. After the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014, Hot Springs was visited by members of the United States House Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs for a Congressional field hearing regarding the proposed closure and the committee heard testimony from members of the Save the VA Committee and others opposed to the closure, as well as two VA administrators in favor of the closure.

==Climate==
Hot Springs has a cool semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) bordering on a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;/&quot;Dwa&quot;).

Thirty afternoons each winter stay below , with all but seven in the severe month of January 1937 not topping the freezing point.

Snowfall averages – vastly less than the extremely snowy high parts of the Black Hills – due to the very dry winters and relatively warm temperatures.

The hottest temperature ever recorded in Hot Springs is , which was achieved on each of three separate occasions: July 25 of 1931, July 10 of 1933, and July 10 of 1939.

== History ==

Cresbard celebrated its centennial in 2006. The town was founded in 1906 when the Minneapolis &amp; St Louis Railway completed a line from Watertown, South Dakota, to LeBeau, South Dakota on the east bank of the Missouri River. It was incorporated in 1909. The name is an amalgam of Cressey and Bard, the names of two local families. In its early years, it served as a grain and livestock center for the northern tier of Faulk County, South Dakota. Cresbard became a well known consolidated school district by the 1920s serving at least seven smaller communities in the surrounding area. The school&#x27;s marching and concert band won national recognition in the 1950s and boys basketball and cross country teams won state titles.

The railway was abandoned by 1940 and State Highway 20 served as the town&#x27;s main link to the outside world. Following a nationwide population upswing after World War II the agriculture-based economy of the area began to show a decreasing population. The population of the school fell from a high of 350 in the 60s and 70s to less than 100 students by the late 1990s.

Because of dwindling high school population (16 at last count) citizens of Cresbard spent several years exploring their options. In 2004 the town&#x27;s total population fell to 121 and the decision was made to redistrict the schools. The high school closed and was offered for sale on the internet the following year at a price calculated to attract outside business.

As of 2007, the primary non-agricultural commercial venture in the town of Cresbard and surrounding areas is services related to the recreational hunting of pheasant, ducks, geese, deer, and buffalo.

Cresbard is also the home of an hotel and restaurant, museum, auto shop, oil supply company, insurance agency, a branch of Dacotah Bank, Senior Citizens center, two churches (one Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod and one Methodist), and a local fire and rescue. It is surrounded by farmland.

<doc id="134848" wikidata="Q408070" url="?curid=134848" title="Airborne Express">
<text>Airborne Express was an express delivery company and cargo airline. Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, its hub was in Wilmington, Ohio. Airborne was founded as the Airborne Flower Traffic Association of California in 1946 to fly flowers from Hawaii to the US mainland. Airborne Express was acquired by DHL in 2003. Prior to the acquisition, it rose to be the third largest private express delivery company in the United States, behind Federal Express (FedEx Express) and United Parcel Service (UPS).

==History==
Growth during Airborne&#x27;s first 22 years was slow, but in 1968, the airline known as Airbourne Freight Company, started going through some changes. The company Air Cargo Equipment Corporation developed and patented a special narrow container, known in the industry later as the &quot;C&quot; container (referring to its C shape), which allowed the more efficient use of space within large jet aircraft. The containers also eliminated the need to modify the cargo doors, thus saving any air-freight company that used them substantial sums of money. It does appear that around this time, early on, that Airborne began using the more efficient containers. Known at that time as Airborne of California, the company merged with Pacific Air Freight of Seattle. The newly formed airline moved its headquarters north to Seattle and changed its name to Airborne Freight Corporation. This was the name they kept until 1980.

===Growth from 1980 to 2003===

* 1980: The airline changed its name to Airborne Express Inc. after buying Midwest Air Charter. Airborne Express made history by buying the Clinton County Air Force Base in Wilmington, and became the first airline in history to own and operate an airport. A number of NAMC YS-11 twin-engined turboprop freight conversions were also purchased. From that point on, Wilmington, Ohio became the company&#x27;s main freight-sorting hub.
* 1988: Airborne started offering same day delivery after buying Sky Courier (now DHL SameDay) as well as forming contracts with other private logistical contractors, in every city where they operated an office. The vehicles (mostly vans), and the drivers employed by these contracted companies, were all outfitted with the colors and uniforms of the rapidly recognizable Airborne colors: gray, red and black. Around this time, Airborne Express offered a less expensive second-day package service, which was modeled after Federal Express&#x27; second-day, or &quot;P2&quot; (priority two) parcel service.
* 1989: Airborne Express changes its name to ABX Air.
* 1991: Airborne received awards from three major companies, including Volvo, and in 1992, the airline introduced Flight-Ready SM, a prepaid express letters and Express Pack system.
* 1993: Airborne introduced the Airborne Logistics System (ALS), which provided Airborne with warehousing and distribution services.
* 1994: Airborne opened the Ocean Services Division, and along with ALS, helped establish the first new film distribution program for Technicolor labs since 1944. In addition, relations were established with Vietnam.
* 1995: Airborne opened a second runway at Wilmington, and Boeing 767 jets were added to the fleet. The Airborne Alliance Group took care of many departments of the company.
* 1996: Airborne&#x27;s stock tripled, which would later lead to a two-for-one stock split in February 1998. Formed that year was Airborne Brokerage Services.
* 1998: Airborne entered the Fortune 500 list for the first time. Airborne&#x27;s first of 30 total Boeing 767s arrived at Wilmington, and the airline won an award from The Business Consumer Guide.
* 1999: Airborne@Home, an alliance with the United States Postal Service, was formed.
* 2000: Carl Donaway became the company&#x27;s new president, which led to many managerial changes. Also that year, Airborne started a ground service for the first time in its history.
* 2001: Airborne Express launched Ground Delivery Service and 10:30 AM Delivery Service. Airborne.com launched some services of its own, including the Small Business Center and Airborne eCourier.
* August 14, 2003: Airborne shareholders approved the acquisition of Airborne Inc. by DHL of Brussels, Belgium. DHL is 100% owned by Deutsche Post World Net. The acquisition became effective the next day. DHL retained ownership of Airborne&#x27;s ground operations and spun off its air operations as ABX Air, Inc.

== Incidents and accidents ==
Airborne Express has experienced seven accidents, with six of them being hull losses, and two resulting in fatalities.

* On June 11, 1979, a de Havilland Dove operated by Midwest Air Charter on behalf of Airborne Express made a belly landing at St. Louis Lambert International Airport. Both crew members survived, but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair and written off.
* On June 19, 1980, a Sud Aviation Caravelle VI-R made a hard landing at Atlanta Municipal Airport (now Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport), causing its left main landing gear to collapse. The aircraft was caught in wake turbulence from a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar. The four occupants (three crew members and one passenger) on board survived. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and written off.
* On February 5, 1985, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15 crashed after takeoff from Philadelphia International Airport. Both pilots on board survived, but the aircraft was substantially damaged and written off.
* On August 20, 1987, Airborne Express Flight 124, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-31, was back taxiing on Runway 09/27 at Stewart International Airport during deteriorating weather conditions, when an Emery Worldwide (operating as Rosenbalm Aviation Flight 074) Douglas DC-8-63F, landed on the same runway without clearance, The DC-9&#x27;s tail was struck by the DC-8&#x27;s wing. There were no fatalities and both aircraft were repaired and returned to service.
* On January 29, 1990, a Cessna 208 Caravan crashed after takeoff from Burlington International Airport. The pilot and the passenger, the aircraft&#x27;s only occupants, were both killed. This was the first fatal accident for Airborne Express. The accident was caused by the overloading of the aircraft and pilot error due to the aircraft not being de-iced before departure.
* On March 6, 1992, a NAMC YS-11A operating a training flight was damaged beyond repair and written off when it made a belly landing at the Wilmington-Airborne Airpark after the crew accidentally forgot to lower the landing gear. All three crew members on board survived.
* On December 22, 1996, Flight 827, a Douglas DC-8-63F, crashed in Narrows, Virginia while performing a flight test. All six people on board were killed. This is the airline&#x27;s deadliest accident.

<text>Timothy Dwight (May 14, 1752January 11, 1817) was an American academic and educator, a Congregationalist minister, theologian, and author. He was the eighth president of Yale College (1795–1817).

==Early life==
Timothy Dwight was born May 14, 1752, in Northampton, Massachusetts.
The Dwight family had a long association with Yale College, as it was then known.
Dwight&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Colonel Timothy Dwight, was born on 19 October 1694 and died on April 30, 1771.
His father, a merchant and farmer known as Major Timothy Dwight, was born May 27, 1726, graduated from Yale in 1744, served in the American Revolutionary War, and died June 10, 1777. His mother Mary Edwards (1734–1807) was the third daughter of theologian Jonathan Edwards.
Dwight was said to have learned the alphabet at a single lesson and to have been able to read the Bible before he was four years old. He had 12 younger siblings, including journalist Theodore Dwight (1764–1846).

Dwight graduated from Yale in 1769 (when he was only 17 years old). For two years, he was rector of the Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven, Connecticut. Dwight was a tutor at Yale College from 1771 to 1777. Licensed to preach in 1777, he was appointed by Congress chaplain in General Samuel Holden Parsons&#x27;s Connecticut Continental Brigade. Dwight served with distinction, inspiring the troops with his sermons and the stirring war songs he composed, the most famous of which is &quot;Columbia&quot;.

On March 3, 1777, Dwight married Mary Woolsey (1754–1854), the daughter of New York merchant and banker Benjamin Woolsey (1720–1771). This marriage connected him to some of New York&#x27;s wealthiest and most influential families. Woolsey had been Dwight&#x27;s father&#x27;s Yale classmate, roommate, and intimate friend.

On news of his father&#x27;s death in the fall of 1778, Dwight resigned his commission and returned to take charge of his family in Northampton. Besides managing the family&#x27;s farms, he preached and taught, establishing a school for both sexes. During this period, he served two terms in the Massachusetts legislature.

==Career==
Dwight first came to public attention with his Yale College 1772 commencement address when he received his M.A. degree and later his &quot;Valedictory Address&quot; of 1776, in which he described Americans as having a unique national identity as a new &quot;people, who have the same religion, the same manners, the same interests, the same language, and the same essential forms and principles of civic government.&quot;

Declining calls from churches in Beverly and Charlestown, Dwight chose instead to settle from 1783 until 1795 as minister in &quot;Greenfield Hill,&quot; a congregational church in Fairfield, Connecticut. There he established an academy, which at once acquired a high reputation and attracted pupils from all parts of the Union, including Elihu Hubbard Smith. Dwight was an innovative and inspiring teacher, preferring moral suasion over the corporal punishment favored by most schoolmasters of the day.

In 1788, Dwight purchased a slave, a woman named Naomi. He stated that his intention was for her to &#x27;purchase&#x27; her freedom for an unspecified number of years of faithful servitude. It is unknown whether she was successful in obtaining her freedom. It is also unknown whether Dwight held her in slavery while serving as the President of Yale.

In 1793, Dwight preached a sermon to the General Association of Connecticut entitled a &quot;Discourse on the Genuineness and Authenticity of the New Testament&quot; which when printed the next year became an important tract defending the orthodox faith against Deists and other skeptics.

===Presidency of Yale College (1795–1817)===

Dwight was the leader of the evangelical New Divinity faction of Congregationalism, a group closely identified with Connecticut&#x27;s emerging commercial elite. Although fiercely opposed by religious moderates, most notably Yale President Ezra Stiles, he was elected to the presidency of Yale on Stiles&#x27;s death in 1795. Shortly afterwards, Dwight was elected an honorary member of the Connecticut Society of the Cincinnati. His ability as a teacher and his talents as a religious and political leader soon made the college the largest institution of higher education in North America. Dwight had a genius for recognizing able protégé such as James Murdock, Lyman Beecher, Nathaniel W. Taylor, and Leonard Bacon, all of whom would become major religious leaders and theological innovators in the antebellum decades.

During troubled times at Yale College, President Timothy Dwight saw his students drawn to the radical republicanism and &quot;infidel philosophy&quot; of the French Revolution, including the philosophies of Hume, Hobbes, Tindal, and Lords Shaftesbury and Bolingbroke. Between 1797 and 1800, Dwight frequently warned audiences against the threats of this &quot;infidel philosophy&quot; in America. An address to the candidates for the baccalaureate in Yale College called &quot;The Nature and Danger of Infidel Philosophy, Exhibited in Two Discourses, Addressed to the Candidates for the Baccalaureate, In Yale College&quot; was delivered on September 9, 1797. It was published by George Bunce in 1798. This book is credited as one of the embers of the Second Great Awakening.

Dr. Dwight has made a contribution to science though he was not trained in any particular field. Yale&#x27;s faculty, still small and theological at the end of its first century, significantly transformed when Dwight hired three new professors between 1801 and 1803: Jeremiah Day, professor of mathematics; James Luce Kingsley, professor of classical languages; and Benjamin Silliman, professor of chemistry and geology. Silliman, Yale&#x27;s first chemist, who introduced science education at Yale, became the patriarch of American science. Day, a minister as well as a mathematician, succeeded Dwight as Yale College president upon his death.

===Religious leadership===
Dwight was as notable for his political leadership as for his religious and educational eminence. Known by his enemies as &quot;Pope&quot; Dwight, he wielded both the temporal sword (as head of Connecticut&#x27;s Federalist Party), and spiritual sword (as nominal head of the state&#x27;s Congregational Church). He led the effort to prevent the disestablishment of the church in Connecticut—and, when its disestablishment appeared inevitable, encouraged efforts by protégés like Beecher and Bacon to organize voluntary associations to maintain the influence of religion in public life. Fearing that the failure of states to establish schools and the rise of infidelity would bring about the destruction of republican institutions, Dwight helped to create a national evangelical movement—the second &quot;Great Awakening&quot;—intended to &quot;re-church&quot; America.

In 1809, Dwight was introduced to the Hawaiian-born Henry ʻŌpūkahaʻia by his relative Edwin W. Dwight, a student at Yale. ʻŌpūkahaʻia, a 17-year-old boy orphaned at the age of 10, had arrived in New Haven after being given passage from Hawaii by New Haven resident Captain Caleb Britnell. Dwight agreed to tutor ʻŌpūkahaʻia, who later became instrumental in establishing Christian missions to Hawaii. In 1810, Dwight became a founder of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, which launched its first mission to Hawaii in 1819 under Hiram Bingham.

===Scholarly accomplishments===
Dwight was a founder of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences and Andover Theological Seminary. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1797, and was also an early member of the American Antiquarian Society, elected in 1813. He received honorary degrees from the College of New Jersey in 1787 and Harvard College in 1810.
Dwight was well-known as an author, preacher, and theologian. He and his brother, Theodore, were members of a group of writers centered around Yale known as the &quot;Hartford Wits&quot; In verse, Dwight wrote an ambitious epic in eleven books, &quot;The Conquest of Canaan&quot;, finished in 1774 but not published until 1785, a somewhat ponderous and solemn satire, &quot;The Triumph of Infidelity&quot; (1788), directed against David Hume, Voltaire and others; &quot;Greenfield Hill&quot; (1794), the suggestion for which seems to have been derived from John Denham&#x27;s &quot;Coopers Hill&quot;; and a number of minor poems and hymns, the best known of which is that beginning &quot;I love thy kingdom, Lord&quot;. Many of Dwight&#x27;s sermons were published posthumously under the titles &quot;Theology Explained and Defended&quot; (5 vols., 1818–1819), to which a memoir of the author by two of his sons, W. T. and Sereno E. Dwight, is prefixed, and &quot;Sermons by Timothy Dwight&quot; (2 vols., 1828), which had a large circulation both in the United States and in England. Probably his most important work, published posthumously, is his &quot;Travels in New England and New York&quot; (4 vols., 1821–1822). The work contains much material of value concerning social and economic New England and New York during the period 1796–1817. The term &quot;Cape Cod House&quot; makes its first appearance in this work. The work also contains the correspondence between Dwight and the theologian Gideon Hawley, following Dwight&#x27;s visit to the elder preacher who was a very close friend of Dwight&#x27;s parents.

===Personal life===
Dwight married Mary Woolsey. They had eight sons: Timothy Dwight (1778–1844), a New Haven merchant and philanthropist; Benjamin Woolsey Dwight (1780–1850), a New York physician; educator and theologian; twins James Dwight (1784–1863) and John Dwight (1784–1803); Sereno Edwards Dwight (1786–1850), who served as the third president of Hamilton College; clergyman William Theodore Dwight (1795–1865); Henry Edwin Dwight (1797–1832), an educator and author; and one who died young. Dwight&#x27;s grandson and namesake, &quot;Timothy Dwight the Younger&quot; (1828–1916), served as Yale&#x27;s president, from 1886 to 1899. His nephew, Theodore Dwight Woolsey (1801–1889), served as Yale&#x27;s president between 1846 and 1871. Another nephew was Theodore Dwight (1796–1866), an author and journalist.

Dwight died of colorectal cancer in 1817 and was buried in New Haven&#x27;s Grove Street Cemetery. Mary Woolsey Dwight, died on October 5, 1845.

==Legacy==

Dwight&#x27;s 1785 poem &quot;The Conquest of Canaan&quot; is considered to be the first American epic poem.

Greenfield Hill&#x27;s Timothy Dwight Elementary School is named after him in Fairfield, Connecticut, as well as Timothy Dwight Park.

In the twentieth century, Yale named Timothy Dwight College for him and his grandson.

In New York City, University Heights, Bronx, has PS 33, Timothy Dwight school, recently expanded.

In 2008, The Library of America selected Dwight&#x27;s account of the murders of Connecticut shopkeeper William Beadle for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime.

<doc id="134880" wikidata="Q173801" url="?curid=134880" title="Eardrum">
<text>In the anatomy of humans and various other tetrapods, the eardrum, also called the tympanic membrane or myringa, is a thin, cone-shaped membrane that separates the external ear from the middle ear. Its function is to transmit changes in pressure of sound from the air to the ossicles inside the middle ear, and thence to the oval window in the fluid-filled cochlea. The ear thereby converts and amplifies vibration in the air to vibration in cochlear fluid. The malleus bone bridges the gap between the eardrum and the other ossicles.

Rupture or perforation of the eardrum can lead to conductive hearing loss. Collapse or retraction of the eardrum can cause conductive hearing loss or cholesteatoma.

==Structure==

===Orientation and relations===
The tympanic membrane is oriented obliquely in the anteroposterior, mediolateral, and superoinferior planes. Consequently, its superoposterior end lies lateral to its anteroinferior end.

Anatomically, it relates superiorly to the middle cranial fossa, posteriorly to the ossicles and facial nerve, inferiorly to the parotid gland, and anteriorly to the temporomandibular joint.

===Regions===

The eardrum is divided into two general regions: the pars flaccida and the pars tensa. The relatively fragile pars flaccida lies above the lateral process of the malleus between the Notch of Rivinus and the anterior and posterior malleal folds. Consisting of two layers and appearing slightly pinkish in hue, it is associated with Eustachian tube dysfunction and cholesteatomas.

The larger pars tensa consists of three layers: skin, fibrous tissue, and mucosa. Its thick periphery forms a fibrocartilaginous ring called the annulus tympanicus or Gerlach&#x27;s ligament. while the central umbo tents inward at the level of the tip of malleus. The middle fibrous layer, containing radial, circular, and parabolic fibers, encloses the handle of malleus. Though comparatively robust, the pars tensa is the region more commonly associated with perforations.

===Umbo===
The manubrium (Latin for &quot;handle&quot;) of the malleus is firmly attached to the medial surface of the membrane as far as its center, drawing it toward the tympanic cavity. The lateral surface of the membrane is thus concave. The most depressed aspect of this concavity is termed the umbo (Latin for &quot;shield boss&quot;).

===Nerve supply===
Sensation of the outer surface of the tympanic membrane is supplied mainly by the auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve (cranial nerve V3), with contributions from the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X), the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), and possibly the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX). The inner surface of the tympanic membrane is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve.

==Clinical significance==

===Examination===
When the eardrum is illuminated during a medical examination, a cone of light radiates from the tip of the malleus to the periphery in the anteroinferior quadrant, this is what is known clinically as 5 o&#x27;clock.

===Rupture===
Unintentional perforation (rupture) has been described in blast injuries and air travel, typically in patients experiencing upper respiratory congestion or general Eustachian tube dysfunction that prevents equalization of pressure in the middle ear. It is also known to occur in swimming, diving (including scuba diving), and martial arts.

Patients with tympanic membrane rupture may experience bleeding, tinnitus, hearing loss, or disequilibrium (vertigo). However, they rarely require medical intervention, as between 80 and 95 percent of ruptures recover completely within two to four weeks. The prognosis becomes more guarded as the force of injury increases.

===Surgical puncture for treatment of middle ear infections===
In some cases, the pressure of fluid in an infected middle ear is great enough to cause the eardrum to rupture naturally. Usually, this consists of a small hole (perforation), from which fluid can drain out of the middle ear. If this does not occur naturally, a myringotomy (tympanotomy, tympanostomy) can be performed. A myringotomy is a surgical procedure in which a tiny incision is created in the eardrum to relieve pressure caused by excessive buildup of fluid, or to drain pus from the middle ear. The fluid or pus comes from a middle ear infection (otitis media), which is a common problem in children. A tympanostomy tube is inserted into the eardrum to keep the middle ear aerated for a prolonged time and to prevent reaccumulation of fluid. Without the insertion of a tube, the incision usually heals spontaneously in two to three weeks. Depending on the type, the tube is either naturally extruded in 6 to 12 months or removed during a minor procedure.

Those requiring myringotomy usually have an obstructed or dysfunctional Eustachian tube that is unable to perform drainage or ventilation in its usual fashion. Before the invention of antibiotics, myringotomy without tube placement was also used as a major treatment of severe acute otitis media.

==Society and culture==
The Bajau people of the Pacific intentionally rupture their eardrums at an early age to facilitate diving and hunting at sea. Many older Bajau therefore have difficulties hearing.

<text>Interior (Lakota: &quot;makȟóšiča otȟúŋwahe&quot;; &quot;Badlands village&quot;) is a town in Jackson County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 65 at the 2020 census.

Interior got its start in 1907 when the Milwaukee Railroad was extended to that point.

==History==

Norwegian immigrants George and Louis Johnson moved from Chamberlain, South Dakota to the banks of the White River just north of the Pine Ridge Reservation in 1883 to establish a way-station for freighting between Chamberlain and the Black Hills. In 1886, the area was connected by rail to Gordon, Nebraska. In 1891, the former way-station was called Black with Mary Johnson as its first postmaster. In 1893, the town was renamed &quot;Interior&quot; by George Johnson because he did not think the name &quot;Black&quot; fit the description of the White River that surrounded the town. In 1907 and 1908, the town was moved two miles and half northwest along the White River to meet the Milwaukee Railroad. The former location of the town became known as &quot;old Interior&quot;.

The town went through major developments in the 1910s: in 1910, an efficient water system transporting water directly from the White River to Interior was installed and an electric grid was installed in 1912. Now with unlimited freshwater combined with being situated along the Milwaukee Railroad and near the Badlands, local committees seized the opportunity to use the town&#x27;s advantage. In 1919, 21 and 22, the town hosted roundups that tourists traveled by train as far from Minneapolis to see. The events hosted cowboys from across the country and Native Americans in traditional clothing also participating.
==Geography==
Interior is located along the White River approximately one mile from Badlands National Park.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

<text>De Smet is a city in and the county seat of Kingsbury County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 1,056 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Located in the area of South Dakota known as &quot;East River&quot; (east of the Missouri River, which diagonally divides the state), De Smet was platted by European Americans in 1880. It was named for Belgian Father Pierre De Smet, a 19th-century Jesuit missionary who worked with Native Americans in the United States and its territories for most of his life. In the mid-1880s, prairie fires and failures of crops after a three-year period of drought caused many settlers to relocate their farms and homesteads to easier areas. By 1917, De Smet was a cow town, with many trains passing through every day carrying cattle to market.
The Charles Ingalls family, originally of Wisconsin, arrived in De Smet in 1879. Their travels and pioneer life in Minnesota, Kansas, Dakota Territory, and Iowa would be later chronicled in the &quot;Little House&quot; series of books written by the Ingallses&#x27; second oldest daughter, Laura Elizabeth - later known as Laura Ingalls Wilder. Laura Ingalls and her husband Almanzo Wilder would first settle in De Smet along with Wilder&#x27;s brother, Royal. They were later joined by their older sister, Eliza Jane, who took up a claim of her own. She was one of the first women to file a solo claim. There the Wilders lived just outside of De Smet on farmland, as well as Royal&#x27;s feed store in town. The Ingallses also had a claim outside of town. In the winter they stayed in the town of De Smet, at least while the girls were still in school. After building a home and starting a farm there, Charles Ingalls helped to found the First Congregational Church of De Smet, later helping to build the church building, with the first service being held there on August 30, 1882. Ingalls and his wife, along with oldest daughter Mary, were among the church&#x27;s eight original charter members.

==Notable people==

De Smet is the town where the family of author Laura Ingalls Wilder finally settled, and is the birthplace of Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s daughter, author and activist Rose Wilder Lane. Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s father, Charles Ingalls, moved to De Smet in 1879 with his wife, Caroline, and their children Mary, Laura, Carrie, and Grace. There, after first living in the Surveyor House and a couple of other locations in De Smet, Ingalls built their permanent home that became known via Wilder&#x27;s writings as &quot;The House That Pa Built&quot;.

Construction on the house began in 1887 and was completed in 1889. After settling in De Smet, Charles Ingalls owned and operated the Ingalls Store from 1880 to 1881, a small general-type store that sold various goods for the home. While the store building no longer exists, the location is noted in De Smet&#x27;s downtown area with a marker on what&#x27;s currently on the site, a former bank building that now houses Gass Law Firm.

De Smet was also the childhood home of supercentenarian Walter Breuning. Artist-illustrator Harvey Dunn was born in 1884 approximately eight miles from De Smet near Manchester, and painted scenes of frontier life in his later years. Harry George Armstrong, a major general in the United States Air Force, a physician, and an airman, was born in De Smet in 1899.

Lake Preston is mentioned in the historical novel &quot;The Long Winter&quot;
by American novelist Laura Ingalls Wilder. In the very severe winter of 1880–1881, a neighbor of Ingalls, David Gilbert, volunteered to make the very risky run from De Smet, South Dakota to Lake Preston (called, at that time, simply &quot;Preston, Dakota Territory&quot;)
to take outgoing mail and bring back the incoming mail. Though the distance was only about 12 miles, the trip was dangerous because of blizzards coming up very quickly throughout that winter, and a person caught on the prairie during a blizzard had almost no chance of survival.

<text>Deadwood (Lakota: &quot;Owáyasuta&quot;; &quot;To approve or confirm things&quot;) is a city that serves as county seat of Lawrence County, South Dakota, United States. It was named by early settlers after the dead trees found in its gulch. The city had its heyday from 1876 to 1879, after gold deposits had been discovered there, leading to the Black Hills Gold Rush. At its height, the city had a population of 25,000, attracting Old West figures such as Wyatt Earp, Calamity Jane, Seth Bullock and Wild Bill Hickok (who was killed there).

The entire town has been designated as a National Historic Landmark District, for its well-preserved Gold Rush-era architecture. The town has five unique history museums that are operated by Deadwood History, inc., a non-profit organization. Deadwood&#x27;s proximity to Lead often prompts the two towns being collectively named &quot;Lead-Deadwood&quot;.

The population was 1,156 at the 2020 census, and according to 2023 census estimates, the city is estimated to have a population of 1,343.

==History==
===19th century===
The settlement of Deadwood began illegally in the 1870s, on land which had been granted to the Lakota people in the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. The treaty had guaranteed ownership of the Black Hills to the Lakota people, who consider this area to be sacred. The settlers&#x27; squatting led to numerous land disputes, several of which reached the United States Supreme Court.
Everything changed after Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer was ordered to lead an expedition into the Black Hills and announced the discovery of gold in 1874, on French Creek near present-day Custer, South Dakota. This announcement was a catalyst for the Black Hills Gold Rush, and miners and entrepreneurs swept into the area. They created the new and lawless town of Deadwood, which quickly reached a population of approximately 5,000. By 1877, about 12,000 people settled in Deadwood, while other sources put the peak number even at 25,000 in 1876.

In early 1876, frontiersman Charlie Utter and his brother Steve led to Deadwood a wagon train containing what they believed were needed commodities, to bolster business. The town&#x27;s numerous gamblers and prostitutes staffed several profitable ventures. Madame Mustache and Dirty Em were on the wagon train, and set up shop in what was referred to as Deadwood Gulch. Women were in high demand by the miners, and the business of prostitution proved to have a good market. Madam Dora DuFran eventually became the most profitable brothel owner in Deadwood, closely followed by Madam Mollie Johnson.
Deadwood became known for its lawlessness; murders were common, and justice for murders not always fair and impartial. The town attained further notoriety when gunman Wild Bill Hickok was killed on August 2, 1876. Both he and Calamity Jane were buried at Mount Moriah Cemetery, as well as other notable figures such as Seth Bullock.

Hickok&#x27;s murderer, Jack McCall, was prosecuted twice, despite the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s prohibition against double jeopardy. Because Deadwood was an illegal town in Indian Territory, non-native civil authorities lacked the jurisdiction to prosecute McCall. McCall&#x27;s trial was moved to a Dakota Territory court, where he was found guilty of murder and hanged.

Beginning August 12, 1876, a smallpox epidemic swept through. So many people fell ill that tents were erected to quarantine the stricken.

In 1876, General George Crook pursued the Sioux Indians from the Battle of Little Big Horn, on an expedition that ended in Deadwood in early September, known as the Horsemeat March. The same month, businessman Tom Miller opened the Bella Union Saloon.

On April 7, 1877, Al Swearengen, who controlled Deadwood&#x27;s opium trade, also opened a saloon; his was called the Gem Variety Theater. The saloon burned down and was rebuilt in 1879. When it burned down again in 1899, Swearengen left town.

As the economy changed from gold panning to deep mining, the individual miners went elsewhere or began to work in other fields. Hence Deadwood lost some of its rough and rowdy character, and began to develop into a prosperous town.

The Homestake Mine in nearby Lead was established in October 1877. It operated for more than a century, becoming the longest continuously operating gold mine in the United States. Gold mining operations did not cease until 2002. The mine has been open for visiting by tourists.

On September 26, 1879, a fire devastated Deadwood, destroying more than 300 buildings and consuming the belongings of many inhabitants. Many of the newly impoverished left town to start again elsewhere.

In 1879, Thomas Edison demonstrated the first successful incandescent lamp in New Jersey, and on September 17, 1883, Judge Squire P. Romans took a gamble and founded the &quot;Pilcher Electric Light Company of Deadwood&quot;. He ordered an Edison dynamo, wiring, and 15 incandescent lights with globes. After delays, the equipment arrived without the globes. Romans had been advertising an event to show off the new lights and decided to continue with the lighting, which was a success. His company grew. Deadwood had electricity service less than four years after Edison commercialized it, less than a year after commercial service was started in Roselle, New Jersey, and around the same time that many larger cities around the country established the service.
In 1888, J.K.P. Miller and his associates founded a narrow-gauge railroad, the Deadwood Central Railroad, to serve their mining interests. In 1893, Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad purchased the railroad. In 1902, a portion of the railroad between Deadwood and Lead was electrified for operation as an interurban passenger system, which operated until 1924. In 1930, the railroad was abandoned, apart from a portion from Kirk to Fantail Junction, which was converted to standard gauge. In 1984, Burlington Northern Railroad abandoned the remaining section.

Some of the other early town residents and frequent visitors included Martha Bullock, Aaron Dunn, E. B. Farnum, Samuel Fields, A. W. Merrick, Dr. Valentine McGillycuddy, Reverend Henry Weston Smith, Sol Star, and Charlie and Steve Utter.

===Chinatown===

The gold rush attracted Chinese immigrants to the area; their population peaked at 250. A few engaged in mining; most worked in service enterprises. A Chinese quarter arose on Main Street, as there were no restrictions on foreign property ownership in Dakota Territory, and a relatively high level of tolerance of different peoples existed in the frontier town. Wong Fee Lee arrived in Deadwood in 1876 and became a leading merchant. He was a community leader among the Chinese Americans until his death in 1921.

The quarter&#x27;s residents also included African Americans and European Americans. During the 2000s, the state sponsored an archeological dig in the area, to study the history of this community of diverse residents.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Another major fire in September 1959 nearly destroyed the town again. About were burned and an evacuation order was issued. Nearly 3,600 volunteer and professional firefighters, including personnel from the Homestake Mine, Ellsworth Air Force Base, and the South Dakota National Guard&#x27;s 109th Engineer Battalion, worked to contain the fire. The property losses resulted in a major regional economic downturn.

In 1961, the entire town was designated a National Historic Landmark, for its well-preserved collection of late 19th-century frontier architecture. Most of the town&#x27;s buildings were built before 1900, with only modest subsequent development. The town&#x27;s population continued to decline through the 1960s and 1970s. Interstate 90 bypassed Deadwood in 1964, diverting travelers and businesses. On May 21, 1980, a raid by county, state, and federal agents on the town&#x27;s three remaining brothels—&quot;The White Door&quot;, &quot;Pam&#x27;s Purple Door&quot; and &quot;Dixie&#x27;s Green Door&quot;—accomplished, as one reporter put it, &quot;what Marshal Hickok never would have done&quot;, and the houses of prostitution were padlocked.

A fire in December 1987 destroyed the historic Syndicate Building and a neighboring structure. The fire prompted renewed interest in the area and hopes for redevelopment. Organizers planned the &quot;Deadwood Experiment,&quot; in which gambling was tested as a means to stimulate growth in the city center. At the time, gambling was legal only in the state of Nevada and in Atlantic City.
Deadwood was the first small community in the U.S. to seek legal gambling revenue to maintain local historic assets. The state legislature legalized gambling in Deadwood in 1989, which generated significant new revenue and development. The pressure of development since then may have an effect on the historical integrity of the landmark district. Heritage tourism is important for Deadwood and the state.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

===Recreation===
In the summer, there are numerous trails for hiking, horseback riding, and mountain biking. The northern end of the George S. Mickelson Trail starts in Deadwood and runs south through the Black Hills to Edgemont. Several man made lakes, including Sheridan Lake, provide fishing and swimming. Spearfish Canyon to the north has many places to rock climb. In early June, the Mickelson Trail Marathon and 5K, as well as accompanying races for children, are held. During the winter, two ski areas operate just a few miles outside of nearby Lead: Terry Peak and Deer Mountain.

The Midnight Star was a casino in Deadwood owned by American film actor Kevin Costner. The casino opened in the spring of 1991, after Costner had directed and starred in the Academy Award-winning film &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; (1990), which was filmed mainly in South Dakota. The Midnight Star was a saloon which featured prominently in the previous western Costner had acted in, &quot;Silverado&quot; (1985), one of his first major roles. International versions of many of his films&#x27; posters lined the walls. The casino closed in August 2017.

<text>Lead ( ) is a city in Lawrence County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 2,982 at the 2020 census. Lead is located in western South Dakota, in the Black Hills near the Wyoming state line.

==History==
The city was officially founded on July 10, 1876, after the discovery of gold. The city was named for the leads or lodes of the deposits of valuable ores. It is the site of the Homestake Mine, the largest, deepest () and most productive gold mine in the Western Hemisphere before closing in January 2002. By 1910, Lead had a population of 8,382, making it the second largest town in South Dakota.

Lead was founded as a company town by the Homestake Mining Company, which ran the nearby Homestake Mine. Phoebe Hearst, wife of George Hearst, one of the principals, was instrumental in making Lead more livable. She established the Hearst Free Public Library in town, and in 1900 the Hearst Free Kindergarten. Phoebe Hearst and Thomas Grier, the Homestake Mine superintendent, worked together to create the Homestake Opera House and Recreation Center for the benefit of miner workers and their families. Phoebe Hearst donated regularly to Lead&#x27;s churches, and provided college scholarships from Lead–Deadwood school which holds a staff of over 130 to the children of mine and mill workers.

In the early 1930s, due to fear of cave-ins of the miles of tunnels under Lead&#x27;s Homestake Mine, many of the town&#x27;s buildings located in the bottom of a canyon were moved further uphill to safer locations.

Lead and the Homestake Mine are the site of the Sanford Underground Research Facility, or Sanford Lab, a NSF facility for low-background experiments on neutrinos, dark matter, and other nuclear physics topics, as well as biology and mine engineering studies. 

In 1974, most of Lead was added to the National Register of Historic Places under the name of the &quot;Lead Historic District&quot;. Over four hundred buildings and were included in the historic district, which has boundaries roughly equivalent to the city limits.
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Two prominent manmade features of Lead&#x27;s geography are the giant open cut, which was used for surface gold mining by the Homestake Mine, and the resulting ridge nearby built with the non-producing material from the cut.

===Climate===
Lead has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm summers and cold, very snowy winters with the typical extremely variable temperatures of the western Great Plains.

Its high elevation in the Black Hills makes Lead one of the wettest places in South Dakota and among the snowiest places in the contiguous United States with a mean snowfall of . During the cold and snowy winter of 1993–94, a whopping of snow fell and three years later snowfall totalled . However, frequent chinook winds mean that most of the enormous snowfall melts during the winter: the highest snow cover on record is on March 1, 1998 – during a storm that totalled of snow (water equivalent ) over six days ending March 2. Mean snow depth in January is only and the median even less at . 12.9 mornings can be expected to fall to or below , with the average window for zero temperatures being December 7 to March 3; on the other hand during winter 12.8 afternoons can be expected to get to or above . The coldest temperature has been on February 8, 1936.

During the spring, weather becomes very changeable with frequent severe storms: the first maximum of at least can be expected on April 17, but the last spring freeze normally does not occur until May 24. The spring is also the wettest season owing to the frequent storms, with the wettest month of May 1965 seeing of precipitation. The wettest year – and a South Dakota calendar year record – has been 2013 with and the driest 1936 with . Summers are very warm in the afternoon, but mornings are pleasantly cool: frost-level temperatures occurred in July 1921 and in the Augusts of 1910 and 1911, with August 1910 seeing a freak snowstorm of . The hottest temperature has been on July 7, 1936, during a notorious Plains heat wave. Precipitation is lower in summer than in spring, and declines further into the fall and winter as temperatures cool. Fall weather is similarly variable in temperature, as is the spring; however, the fall period tends to be less prone to severe weather.

<text>Spearfish (Lakota: &quot;Hočhápȟe&quot;) is a city in Lawrence County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 12,193 at the time of the 2020 census, making it the 10th most populous city in South Dakota. Spearfish is the largest city in Lawrence County and the home of Black Hills State University.

==History==
Before the Black Hills Gold Rush of 1876, the area was used by Native Americans (primarily bands of Sioux but others also ranged through the area). Once the gold rush started, the city was founded in 1876 at the mouth of Spearfish Canyon, and was originally called Queen City. Spearfish grew as a supplier of foodstuffs to the mining camps in the hills. Even today, a significant amount of truck farming and market gardening still occurs in the vicinity.

In 1887, the accepted history of gold mining in the Black Hills was thrown into question by the discovery of what has become known as the Thoen Stone. Discovered by Louis Thoen on Lookout Mountain, the stone purports to be the last testament of Ezra Kind who, along with six others, entered the Black Hills in 1833, &quot;got all the gold we could carry&quot; in June 1834, and were subsequently &quot;killed by Indians beyond the high hill.&quot; There is corroborating historical evidence for the Ezra Kind party.

In the 20th century, the history of Spearfish was tied to mining and tourism. Architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who visited Spearfish Canyon in 1935, later called the area &quot;unique and unparalleled elsewhere in our country,&quot; and wondered, &quot;How is it that I&#x27;ve heard so little of this miracle and we, toward the Atlantic, have heard so much of the Grand Canyon when this is even more miraculous?&quot;

The Homestake Sawmill (previously part of Pope and Talbot, now owned by Neimen Forest Products) was built to supply timbers for the Homestake Mine in Lead (closed January 2002). In 1938, Joseph Meier brought the Luenen Passion Play to settle permanently in Spearfish and become the Black Hills Passion Play, drawing thousands of visitors every year during the summer months. After Meier&#x27;s death in 2007, the amphitheater and surrounding it were put up for sale.

==Geography==
Spearfish is located at 44°29′23″N 103°51′9″W (44.489803, −103.852585).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

Spearfish Creek is a fast-moving creek that emerges from Spearfish Canyon at Spearfish. It runs roughly south to north through the center of town (parallel to Canyon Street), year round. The creek freezes from the bottom up instead of icing over. This unusual phenomenon occurs due to the very fast rate at which the creek flows. This speed prevents ice from forming except along the bottom of the creek bed where friction and turbulence allow the water to slow down long enough to freeze. Since the creek continues to flow atop this ice, the water level of the creek gradually rises as more ice accumulates on the bottom, in some cases causing flooding on the north side of town where the channel is not as deep.

==Climate==
Given its location at the base of the Black Hills and its proximity to the High Plains, the climate in Spearfish is highly variable at any time of the year, a phenomenon especially apparent in the winter months. According to the Köppen climate classification, Spearfish has humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;). Snow depth is limited: even in winter half of all days have no snow on the ground, although on average of snow falls.

===World record temperature change===
Spearfish holds the world record for the fastest recorded temperature change. On January 22, 1943, at about 7:30 a.m. MST, the temperature in Spearfish was . The Chinook wind picked up speed rapidly, and two minutes later (7:32 a.m.) the temperature was . The rise in two minutes set a world record that still holds. By 9:00 a.m., the temperature had risen to . Suddenly, the Chinook died down and the temperature tumbled back to . The drop took only 27 minutes. The sudden change in temperatures caused glass windows to crack and windshields to instantly frost over.

Extreme winter maxima in the district are remarkably warm given the latitude and altitude; on January 19, 1921, Spearfish reached a temperature of , the hottest January temperature in South Dakota on record.

<text>Canton is a city in and the county seat of Lincoln County, South Dakota, United States. Canton is located 20 minutes south of Sioux Falls in southeastern South Dakota. Canton is nestled in the rolling hills of the Sioux Valley, providing an abundance of recreational activities with the Big Sioux River bordering the eastern side, Newton Hills State Park to the south, and Lake Alvin to the north. The city was named by Norwegian settler and former legislator James M. Wahl. The population was 3,066 as of the 2020 census.

==History==
The earliest known visitor to the area was Lewis P. Hyde, who first came to the area in 1866. The first actual settler was August Linderman. By 1868, there were 35 people living in Lincoln County. The residents named the community Canton, believing the location to be the exact opposite of Canton, China. By the summer of that year, a caravan of 180 Norwegian settlers crossed the Big Sioux River to make their home in Canton. In 1880, the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad crossed the Big Sioux River to reach Canton. The city still has an active rail freight service. The city has many historical homes and buildings dating back to the late 1800s. Some notable sites include The Kennedy Mansion on Dakota Street, as well as the Historical Society House built in 1886.

The racial makeup of the city was 95.8% White, 0.3% African American, 1.3% Native American, 0.8% Asian, 0.2% from other races, and 1.6% from two or more races.

==Augustana College==
In 1884, Augustana College moved from Beloit, Iowa, to Canton. An elementary through high school was also built as part of Augustana&#x27;s relocation, and educated the internationally known physicist Merle Tuve, and brothers John Lawrence and Ernest Lawrence.

Augustana struggled in Canton until Anthony G. Tuve became president in 1890. Attendance doubled, but a series of crop failures soon followed. As a result, in 1894, the Church Synod withheld appropriations. President Tuve assumed all financial obligations in order to keep the school open. After the crisis, Augustana prospered and soon outgrew its building. The building was moved in 1901. Then, in 1902, the college added to the campus on the east side of town. A four and ½ story brick building was erected to house classrooms, a gymnasium, and chapel. The new structure was dedicated in 1903. The college continued to grow. Enrollment increased to 330 by 1918. The school became widely known for its excellence in academics and for the many scholars who came for speaking engagements.

The United Norwegian Lutheran Synod had its headquarters on campus. An event in 1917 took place that changed the college and community. That year, the Norwegian Lutheran Synods merged to become the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America. The new synod considered it inadvisable to maintain Augustana College and Lutheran Normal School in Sioux Falls, barely 25 miles apart. A vigorous campaign to keep the college in Canton began. But, the advantages of locating the school in a larger community prevailed, and Canton lost their college. The bitterness was great, and was intensified when President Tuve died suddenly. The area pastors in the South Dakota district realized something needed to be done. An agreement was proposed and accepted that Canton would put up an endowment of $200,000 and turn it over to Augustana College. Then, the Normal School division would move to Canton. A fund drive was successful and the Canton Lutheran Normal School opened in the fall of 1920. The gradual transfer of the academy division to the Canton campus was made between 1920 and 1932. The school was known as Augustana Academy in 1932 and was no longer a division of the college. Capital improvements were made to the campus through the next several years including a new gymnasium and dormitory.

The history of Augustana Academy came to an end in 1971. The campus was closed and was sold to Keystone Treatment Center. The “Old Main” building has been converted into apartments.

==National Ski Tournament Site and Sioux Valley Ski Club==
A young man named Ludwig Hoiby, a student at Augustana and originally from Norway, gave a skiing exhibition to a group of Canton students in 1911. This exhibition began the quest to clear the hill at the Thorson farm located on the Iowa side of the Sioux River east of Canton. In 1923 the first meet sponsored by the Sioux Valley Ski Club was held at a new location several hundred yards east of the original hill. A 250-foot scaffold and an improved takeoff were built and the Central U.S. Tournament was held the following year. On February 11 and 12, 1925, the National Tournament was held and Canton was host to over 10,000 fans. World-renowned singer, Eric Bye, presented the awards to the winners of several divisions. The winner of the &quot;A&quot; Division was awarded The Sioux Valley loving cup, a silver traveling trophy. Many notables were present that day including a member of the Olympic team, former national champions, and the international winner and the winner of the world distance title. Tournaments were held annually at the site and in 1930 the Club hosted the U.S. National Tournament a second time. 
In 1932 the U.S. Olympic Ski Jumping trials were held at the hill with Casper Oimoen winning the &quot;A&quot; Division. Three of the four qualifiers to the Olympics were members of the Sioux Valley Ski Club. Later that winter Oimoen would place 4th in the Olympics at Lake Placid, NY behind three Norwegian skiers. Snow was scarce in 1933 so it was trucked in 90 miles from Spirit Lake and Lake Okoboji, Iowa. By the time the snow was in place, it had turned into slush. Winds changed and brought bitter temperatures causing the slush to turn to ice so the tournament had to be cancelled. The largest crowd on record at the hill was in 1935 when the club hosted its third and final National Tournament. 15,000–20,000 people attended and out of town spectators stayed in Canton or Sioux Falls, SD hotels and in Pullman cars brought in by the railroad. The Sioux Valley Ski Club hosted its final Central U.S. Tournament in 1936. Poor attendance in 1936, cost increases and uncooperative weather prompted the club to fold the following year. Wind blew down the scaffolding in the 1940s, and in the 1960s the hill was used as a motorcycle climb. Today the site can be seen south of a South Dakota historic marker on U.S. Highway 18 two miles east of Canton.

==Hiawatha Insane Asylum==
The first and only institution for insane Indians in the United States was Hiawatha Asylum for Insane Indians. It was placed in Canton because of the central location among the Western states with a large Indian populations and because of the influence of South Dakota&#x27;s Representative O.S. Gifford and Senator R. F. Pettigrew. In 1898, Congress passed a bill creating the institution. The bill establishing the Hiawatha Asylum for Insane Indians passed in 1899, and the Indian Appropriation Act for 1900 set aside $3,000 for land purchase and $42,000 for building construction. One hundred acres were purchased a mile east of Canton on the hills overlooking the Sioux River. The asylum was closed in 1934.

The asylum grounds and buildings were used for a short time by South Dakota as a penitentiary for first time offenders. In 1946, in what Cantonites refer to as the &quot;second Manhattan Purchase,&quot; the city purchased for $1.00 the 337 acres and buildings of the old institution. The only stipulation of the purchases was that it be used for the welfare of the community. For a time, the asylum hospital was used for the Canton-Inwood Hospital, but today the old asylum buildings are gone. The land is now home to Sanford Hospital Canton-Inwood, Three Rivers Gun Club, the 4-H fairground and Hiawatha Country Club and Golf Course.

Today, a cemetery for 121 patients of the asylum is located on the original grounds of the asylum. The National Park Service added the cemetery to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.

<text>Harrisburg is a city in Lincoln County, South Dakota, United States and is a suburb of Sioux Falls. The population was 6,732 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Before the railroad was built through Lincoln County, a stagecoach brought mail to the Johnson Harris Homestead located on Nine Mile Creek in Dayton Township. Johnson Harris named the post office Harrisburg in honor of himself.

The history of Harrisburg started August 1, 1879, when the first train came rolling through the territory. The train went from Sioux City, Iowa, to Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The post office was moved to the Emory J. Darling Homestead, 1 mile south of what is now Harrisburg. The post office was called Salina in honor of Mrs. Jim Stillwell, an early settler and a highly respected teacher.

Finally in 1890, the depot was moved to its present site. The post office took back its original name and the town of Harrisburg was born.

One of the many early businesses in Harrisburg was the State Bank, &quot;circa&quot; 1901–1945. The bank&#x27;s building is still located in its original spot at 101 Railroad Ave. The bank itself was built in 1899 and completely restored in 2006 by its current owner RISE, Inc. is a construction management/structural engineering firm.

Much mystery surrounds the old bank building, including whether or not the infamous bandit John Dillinger stopped to rob it. According to popular legend, after Dillinger robbed the bank, he fired a round into the teller counter as a reminder not to follow him out. That bullet hole remains there today.

==Government==
The city of Harrisburg is led by a mayor-council (strong mayor) form of government. Mayoral elections occur every four years. City council seats are contested every three years; However, not all of the council members are elected in the same year. The council consists of four members elected to represent two wards.
