<text>Whitemarsh Township is a home rule municipality in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. It retains its former classification of &quot;Township&quot; in its official name despite being a home rule municipality. The population was 19,707 at the 2020 census. Whitemarsh is adjacent to the neighborhood of Andorra in the Roxborough section of Philadelphia, and is bordered in Montgomery County by Springfield, Upper Dublin, Whitpain, and Plymouth townships, Conshohocken, and the Schuylkill River, which separates it from Lower Merion Township.

Communities in Whitemarsh Township include Barren Hill, Lafayette Hill, part of Miquon, which straddles Whitemarsh and Springfield townships, Spring Mill, part of Plymouth Meeting, which straddles Whitemarsh and Plymouth townships, and part of Fort Washington, some of which is in Whitemarsh, but which is chiefly in Upper Dublin Township.

==History==

Whitemarsh was originally inhabited by the Lenape tribe of Native Americans. It was first settled by European colonists in 1683. At that time, Whitemarsh was part of a tract of land that Major Jasper Farmar had purchased from William Penn. Farmar died shortly thereafter, before making the voyage across the ocean to settle on his newly purchased land. But his widow and family, with servants, sailed to Philadelphia in 1685, and established their homestead on the part of their land that lay in nearby Fort Washington. After Farmar&#x27;s widow died in the 1690s, her son Edward began to sell 100- to 200-acre parcels of their Whitemarsh land to Quakers and German immigrants.

In 1686, limestone was discovered in Oreland, which extends across nearby Springfield and Upper Dublin townships. The subsequent discovery of limestone in the township itself drew new settlers to Whitemarsh. In 1704, Whitemarsh Township was incorporated. At that time, it was located in Philadelphia County. In 1784, Montgomery County was created, and Whitemarsh was made part of it, becoming one of the new county&#x27;s 28 original communities. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, Whitemarsh was characterized by large English estates and its famed limestone quarries.

During the American Revolutionary War, both the Battle of White Marsh and the Battle of Barren Hill took place within the township.

==History==
Whitpain is one of the oldest townships in Montgomery County. Richard Whitpaine, a London butcher, purchased a tract of land as part of William Penn’s &quot;Holy Experiment&quot;. His 16-year-old son, Zechariah, travelled to Pennsylvania on the ship &quot;Welcome&quot; with Penn in 1682 to settle his father&#x27;s properties and escape persecution of his Quaker beliefs. By 1685, Zechariah had established a plantation house along Wissahickon Creek near Mount Pleasant, with his bride Sarah Songhurst, whom he had met on the &quot;Welcome&quot;.

In Holme&#x27;s Map of 1681, Whitpain Township is called &quot;Whitpain&#x27;s Creek&quot;. Whitpain Township has been an independent township since 1701, as it appears as &quot;Whitpain&#x27;s Township&quot; in the survey of all the townships in the Commonwealth ordered by William Penn. The borders of Whitpain Township changed dramatically in 1733, when Worcester Township was created, taking away a significant portion of its area. For a brief period in 1762, Whitpain and Plymouth Township, by act of the Assembly, became one district with one supervisor from each township. Dissatisfaction by the populace of both townships led the Assembly to repeal the act in 1763.

By 1734, Whitpain Township had 24 landowners. It maintained steady growth for more than two centuries, expanding from 771 people in 1800 to 3,063 people in 1950. In recent years, the township has experienced rapid growth. Today, Whitpain Township is home to over 18,000 residents.

Early settlers to Whitpain Township were farmers. Industry came to the region in 1727, when Jacob Yost began a weaving enterprise in Centre Square. Charles Mather built an additional mill in 1804. Although a rural farming community for decades, the growth of recent years has included business development, making Whitpain Township home to several of the Philadelphia region&#x27;s largest corporations, including Aetna US Healthcare and Unisys.

Although today Whitpain Township is home to residents of many religions and nationalities, its earliest settlers were Protestant and Quaker. Prior to the Revolutionary War, the township had two churches: Boehm&#x27;s Reformed Church (circa 1740), and St. John&#x27;s Lutheran Church (circa 1769).

Whitpain Township earned a place in history during the Revolutionary War, when George Washington and many of his generals spent time in the township. Dawesfield, a home on Lewis Lane, is considered the most significant historic site in the township because it was Washington&#x27;s headquarters from October 21 to November 2, 1777. Dawesfield was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.

<text>Willow Grove is a census-designated place (CDP) in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. A community in Philadelphia&#x27;s northern suburbs, the population was 13,730 at the 2020 census. It is located in Abington Township and Upper Moreland Township. Willow Grove was once known for Willow Grove Park, an amusement park that was open from 1896 to 1976, now the site of Willow Grove Park Mall. Willow Grove is considered an edge city of Philadelphia, with large amounts of retail and office space.

Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove was located northwest of the Willow Grove CDP in Horsham Township. NAS JRB Willow Grove transitioned into Horsham Air National Guard Station in September 2011.

Willow Grove is located southeast of Allentown and north of Philadelphia.

==History==
The place was on the route of an old Lenape trail to New York and developed into a typical colonial crossroads, with inns, stables, blacksmiths, and wheelwright shops. William Penn granted land to physician Nicholas More and the tract became known as the &quot;Manor of Moreland&quot; and later, Moreland Township. The place dates to the year 1711 when the Old York Road was laid out from Philadelphia to New Hope where the Delaware River was crossed at Coryell&#x27;s Ferry. In 1792, mapmaker Reading Howell was said to remark upon the abundance of &quot;willow trees in the marshy land&quot; and the name &quot;Willow Grove&quot; stuck. During the American Revolution, inn keeper Joseph Butler, proprietor of the Red Lion Inn at Willow Grove tended to wounded American soldiers. He was later arrested by the British and held prisoner in Philadelphia.

In 1778, British troops under Lt. Col. Abercromby marched through Willow Grove to the Battle of Crooked Billet in Hatboro.

=== 19th century ===
By 1850, the village was a major crossroads and stage coach stop with five stage lines a day. George Rex, a blacksmith from Germantown, had developed the Mineral Springs Inn in the early 19th century. The springs contained a high concentrate of minerals, like iron and sulfur, which had a reputation of curative powers. There was a recreational park with walking trails and gardens, mineral spring water baths and stables for 100 horses. It was likely at these stables that the Irish emigrant Thomas Carolan (1806-1870) found work as a blacksmith and farrier. In 1847, Carolan, wife Elizabeth Smyth (1817-1876) and their children had fled the Great Hunger in Ireland aboard the &quot;Patrick Henry&quot;. They made their way to Willow Grove where they lived until taken in by an elderly Quaker couple with a 100-acre farm a mile to the north east of the village. They moved to a farm near Fitzwatertown by 1865. 

In 1896, Willow Grove Park was established by the owners of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company as an escape from the hot summers in Philadelphia. The Pennsylvania &amp; Reading Railroad erected a station in Willow Grove. Soon it became a popular music venue where band leaders like John Phillip Sousa drew as many as 50,000 people a day to the concerts. The park later featured amusement rides and, for a time, was referred to as the &quot;Music Capital of the World&quot;.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 Census, there were 5,853 people, 2,255 households, and 2,065 families residing in the CDP. The CDP was 74.7% Non-Hispanic White, 16.8% Black or African American, 0.2% Native American and Alaskan Native, 3.1% Asian, 1.6% Hispanic or Latino, and 4.7% two or more races. The median income for a household in the CDP was $142,583.

==Transportation==
Wyndmoor is served by two SEPTA stations. The first is the Wyndmoor station which is on the Chestnut Hill East line. The station is located in the nearby Chestnut Hill neighborhood of Philadelphia. Residents can also use the Oreland station on the Lansdale/Doylestown line which is located in the Oreland section of Springfield Township. Bus routes serving Wyndmoor include the and routes.

==History==
William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, reserved Springfield Township as one of his family&#x27;s original manors in the 1680s.

The origin of the name &quot;Wyndmoor&quot; is somewhat obscure. The community was earlier called &quot;Bungtown,&quot; &quot;Spring (or Springfield) Village,&quot; and &quot;Tedyuscung,&quot; after the Native American leader, Teedyuscung, whose statue stands overlooking the Wissahickon Creek in Valley Green. &quot;Wyndmoor&quot; is variously said to be an appellation offered by the Heebner family who donated land for the Reading Railroad station, or originally the name of the estate of Randal Morgan, who made a fortune in oil and purchased property adjacent to the Reading Railroad station about 1900. The name eventually replaced the name &quot;Springfield Village&quot; for the small collection of shops and houses just east of Stenton Avenue, and finally encompassed the entire residential area east of Stenton Avenue.

Wyndmoor was the site of Whitemarsh Hall, the estate of banking executive Edward T. Stotesbury. The estate became a housing development in the late 1940s, and the 147-room mansion was demolished in 1980, but the columns of its portico and pieces of statuary survive in the neighborhoods of Wyndmoor.

The Stotesbury Club House and John Welsh House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Wyndmoor Hose Company==
===20th century===
Wyndmoor Hose Company No. 1 was formed in 1906 and chartered in 1907. The seeds of the local fire company grew out of an industrial base at Mermaid Lane and Queen Street. There, the Nelson Valve Company began an in-house fire brigade to meet the needs of the dangerous industrial mechanisms used to make hydraulic valves. Eventually, the local community was solicited for its help in keeping this fire unit viable and expanding its services to the larger community. Residents volunteered, recognizing the communal benefit, and with help from the valve company a two-wheeled hand cart was purchased and 500 feet of hose. By 1909, the shed used at the valve Company was expanded, as were the hose carts to four wheels and two horses. Horse power proved a problem. A monetary reward was granted to the first horse team to arrive at the sound of the alarm and haul the apparatus to the scene. This actually produced a rivalry among horse teams!

At the dawn of the Roaring Twenties the fire company got a new home, on Queen Street closer to Willow Grove Ave. It still stands and served as a firehouse for nearly 50 years. In 1927, Wyndmoor purchased two Hale Pumpers and in 1940 a city service ladder truck. As the nations infant automotive industry diversified and began to specialize, communities began purchasing recognizable fire apparatus. A huge property along Willow Grove Ave. was purchased by the fire company, and large fairs were held for a dozen years. The proceeds from these carnivals offset astronomical costs and allowed the continued modernization of the fire service in Wyndmoor.

Wyndmoor Hose Company is a 100% volunteer department. The fifty-plus members who make up the working force are notified by digital paging systems, day and night, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365-days-a-year.

In the late 1990s, it was decided that the fire company would add emergency medical services to its already expanded list of rescue operations. The company purchased the QRS (Quick Response Service) unit that houses enough basic life support and first-aid equipment to complement the Springfield Ambulance Association&#x27;s arrival.

===21st century===
Shortly after WHCo sent a crew to Ground Zero following September 11, 2001&#x27;s terrorist activities, the Hazardous Materials operation also expanded. Wyndmoor teamed with HazMat 919 as Eastern Montgomery County&#x27;s primary decontamination service. A larger environmental response trailer was purchased to accommodate the increased quantity of equipment needed. A much more in-depth training program was enforced and all WHCo members were required to complete advanced levels of hazardous materials training.

Today Wyndmoor Hose Company, No. 1 is equipped to respond to virtually any emergency. Currently the department responds with a 2007 Pierce Rescue, a Ford F550, has a boat used for rescue, and trailers. A &#x27;19 Rosenbauer with a 55&#x27; aerial boom was received May 2019 - Snorkel 82. From building fire to vehicle rescue, from hazardous material to emergency medical situations, Wyndmoor has personnel that are well trained and highly skilled prepared to act.

==Education==
The school district is Springfield Township School District.

Other institutions:
*La Salle College High School
*The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential (IAHP)

<doc id="133447" wikidata="Q1135472" url="?curid=133447" title="Danville, Pennsylvania">
<text>Danville is a borough in and the county seat of Montour County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the North Branch of the Susquehanna River. The population was 4,221 at the 2020 census. Danville is part of the Bloomsburg-Berwick micropolitan area.

Danville is the home of Geisinger Medical Center, a trauma center employing over 10,000 people.

==History==
===Native American history===
As Europeans explored the coastal regions reachable from ships at the dawn of the 17th Century, the whole valley of the Susquehanna from South-central New York state to the upper Chesapeake Bay was owned by the fierce Iroquois-like Susquehannock people, like the Erie people, an Iroquoian speaking tribe with a similar related culture. As the European wars of religion lulled before the cataclysm of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, ca. 1600 AD the protestant Dutch traders first entered the Delaware Valley and began regularly trading firearms for furs, especially highly valued beaver pelts with the inland Susquehannock people in the vicinity of greater Philadelphia.
Although the Susquehannocks lived well inland their hunting range owned the rich Beaver territory of the entire Susquehanna River drainage basin, since the Susquehannock&#x27;s range also included hunting the Schuylkill and Lehigh Rivers and their tributaries (which they historically disputed by occasional mutual raiding with the Algonquian Delaware people dwelling along the Atlantic coastal strip extending west from Delaware and southern New Jersey into the Poconos), the Susquehanna had a wealth of coveted Beaver pelts, and so became formidably well armed.

===The Beaver Wars===
About the time New Sweden (1638) was founded, the Iroquois Confederacy began a series of escalating wars setting Indian versus Indian called the Beaver Wars—that ultimately would open up the frontier to white settlers—deadly long running territorial wars between Amerindian peoples for &quot;fur hunting and trapping territories&quot;. Forearmed by their traders knowledge, the Swedes settled both sides of the Delaware, and almost immediately became allies with the Susquehannock, who already well armed, would soon after have a confederacy well armed enough to win a war declared by the colonial Province of Maryland, subjugate several Delaware tribes and would inflict several stinging defeats on Iroquois forces.

By the mid-1650s New Netherlands absorbed New Sweden, and in 1666-67, the English took over New Netherlands, but most of the colonial populations in both cases, including traders, merely switched governors and went on with business as usual, where the most lucrative business was for furs.

What little is known of the Susquehannock tribe comes mostly from a few traders and the work of a single Dutch missionary who lived with them for a time about 1640. They were a fierce and powerful people holding off territorial infringements from the tribes on all sides of their range from the Potomac to the Mohawk valley, and the Poconos to the Alleghenies. Danville, located in the southern center of the valley would have been at least a summer hunting camp for these people, who were to become horribly affected by epidemic plagues of disease over multiple years circa 1668-72. This sudden weakness in population ironically occurred shortly after the Susquehannocks gave a serious drubbing about 1665-66 over 2-3 years to two of the Five Nations of the Iroquois in the local Beaver Wars. After the drastic weakening, they were attacked on all sides by subjected tribes, colonists, and the Iroquois, suffering further large losses.

By 1678, the Iroquois would agree in a treaty to absorb most of the remaining Iroquoian Susquehannocks whose civilization had collapsed, though several hundred remnants migrated to live south and west of the Wyoming Valley, and would be called the Conestoga by the new English settlers in the colony of Pennsylvania, whilst the Susquehannock confederation would go extinct as an Iroquoian people and its surviving people would be absorbed into other tribes. Hence, Danville was Iroquois land until a 1768 treaty after the French and Indian War.

===16th-18th century===
In November 1773, William Montgomery began acquiring land in Northumberland County from J. Cummings. On November 26, 1774 he acquired 180 acres along Mahoning Creek and Susquehanna River known as &quot;Karkaase&quot; from J. Simpson. Following his service in the New York and New Jersey Campaign, William re-settled his family from Chester County to Northumberland. Originally referred to as &quot;Montgomery&#x27;s Landing&quot;, it would become known as Danville after his son, Daniel Montgomery. After developing his farm, William developed the first gristmill, sawmill, and trading post. In 1778, his family fled during the Big Runaway to Fort Augusta and returned following the Battle of Wyoming. In 1792, William constructed the General William Montgomery House. In the same year Daniel plotted the area between Mill Street and Church Street, the historic core of the town which now bears his name.

===Early 19th century===
Danville was part of Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, when it was founded. In 1813, Columbia County, Pennsylvania was formed from part of Northumberland Co. Danville became the county seat of Columbia Co. until 1845, when an election moved the seat to Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. In 1850, Montour County was formed from part of Columbia. Danville then became the county seat of Montour.

Danville became a transportation center in the mid-19th century as the technology of early railroads developed, allowing accelerated development of inland communities. Danville first serviced canal boats plying the navigations on the Susquehanna between the coal docks in Pittston and Wilkes-Barre connecting to the Union Canal, and Harrisburg. Subsequently, it became served by several railroads also running along the banks of the North Branch of the Susquehanna River. Railroads helped local businesses expand their sales as they supplied major cities outside of Danville. Coal and iron mines in the surrounding hills and mountains fueled the local economy, and by mid-century Danville was an important iron mill town. Many of the rails of the nation&#x27;s expanding railroad system were made in Danville, an important contribution to a network which grew explosively for decades. By the 1890s there were 7-8 major railroads running into the Wyoming Valley for Anthracite. A local marker claims that the first T-rail rolled in the United States was rolled in Danville, on October 8, 1845 at the Montour Iron Company, though this is claimed for Mount Savage, Maryland, as well.

===Late 19th century===
Montour and several other enormous iron mills dominated the town for most of the 19th century and the iron industry was the chief employer in the region. The iron mills fell into decline, however, as steel replaced iron in the 20th century. The city celebrates this era with an annual Iron Heritage Festival in July, and the main street is still named &quot;Mill Street&quot;.
In 1869 the Danville State Hospital was built as a state institution for the treatment and care of the mentally ill.

===20th century and beyond===
Abigail Geisinger, widow of iron magnate George Geisinger, used his fortune to build a hospital and clinic intended to be a regional medical center modeled after the Mayo Clinic. The Geisinger Hospital was completed in 1915, and has grown over the years. Today, the Geisinger Medical Center is the most important tertiary referral center in northern Pennsylvania. Geisinger and its affiliated institutions are also one of the largest employers in the region.

In the early 1960s, local company Susquehanna Danville Airport produced airboats for evaluation by the U.S. Army. Susquehanna was a joint venture between Ken Burrows-owned Danville Airport of Danville and Mari-Mar Industries of Port Trevorton, Pennsylvania. The airboats, called Susquehanna Skimmers, were evaluated in Vietnam between June 1964 and late 1965. The six Skimmers competed with six Hurricane Aircats, made by the Hurricane Fiberglass Products Company of Auburndale, Florida. The Skimmer lost to the Aircat, which was found to be more durable, easier to maneuver, and have greater obstacle crossing capabilities than the Susquehanna Skimmer, although the Skimmer outperformed the Aircat in deep water.

The Thomas Beaver Free Library and Danville YMCA, Danville Historic District, Danville West Market Street Historic District, and General William Montgomery House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2014, Republican Bernie Swank replaced Democrat Ed Coleman as Mayor. Coleman was Mayor of Danville for 16 years. Swank defeated Democrat Tom Graham by 50 votes out of 682 votes cast. She previously served as mayor from 1989 to 1996.

On January 22, 2022, a truck carrying about 100 lab monkeys collided with a dump truck along Route 54 near Danville, allowing four monkeys to escape. Three monkeys were later euthanized, while another remains missing. The truck was bound for a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) facility, leading to fears of a disease outbreak; several witnesses reported symptoms following their contact with the monkeys and were advised to quarantine by the CDC.

==Recreation==
The borough council is a partner of the Montour Area Recreation Commission. They hope to attract state funding to study recreational opportunities along the Susquehanna River. Hess Field is a park located on Meadow Lane.

The Montour Area Recreation Commission (MARC) led a local volunteer effort to clear the abandoned towpath of the North Branch Canal along the Susquehanna River. A mile of the towpath was cleared, permitting biking, walking and running near the Danville Soccer Park. The canal is over 200 years old. It was an important part of the region&#x27;s transportation system. Canal boats and rafts moved farm produce, lumber and people up and down the river. This is part of a greenway effort to develop recreation and commercial opportunities along the river. The long-term vision is to create a regional trail that connects Northumberland to Catawissa and on to Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania.

Running through the outskirts of Danville, the J. Manley Robbins trail is alleged to be the oldest documented rail-trail in the United States. The former railroad line for the &quot;Montour,&quot; a 10-ton narrow gauge locomotive used for carrying iron ore between deposits and furnaces, the line was converted to a bicycle path in 1890s. The original one mile railbed trail section now connects with adjacent additional trails and recreation amenities near the Mahoning Creek.

<text>Bath is a borough in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. As of the 2020 census, Bath had a population of 2,808. It is part of the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th-most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. as of the 2020 census.

==History==
Bath is located at the head of the Monocacy Creek in an area of the Lehigh Valley that was once rich in agriculture. The greater area of the town, however, lies east of the Monocacy Valley. Prior to European settlement, Bath was inhabited by the Lenape Indigenous tribe.

Bath was established in 1728 as a Scotch-Irish settlement before the American Revolution as the first settlement by white people in the Forks of the Delaware River. It is named for Bath, Somerset, England by Margaret DeLancey, who sold land under her father, lieutenant colonel of the Continental Army, William Allen, in the 1700s.

On March 3, 1737, the 247 acres of land that is currently inside the boundaries of Bath was purchased and surveyed for Daniel Craig. According to borough historians, this land spans from Chestnut Street to the north of Northampton Street. William Allen conveyed the greater part of Bath&#x27;s land to his son, Andrew, in 1776, the same year that the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia signed the Declaration of Independence, declaring its freedom from British colonial governance. That same year, Andrew Allen sold 150 acres of the land to John Lattimore. Andrew Allen also owned land west of the Monocacy, which was eventually confiscated and sold to local families in the area. Today, Bath&#x27;s current acreage is 576 acres and is less than 1 sq. mi. in area.

Southeast of the town, a French and Indian War blockhouse was constructed to fortify the area from potential attacks. It was named Fort Ralston after the name of the farmer whose land it was built on. It is alternatively known as Brown&#x27;s Fort, after the adjacent landowner. It was established as a fort in 1755, but likely abandoned by the end of the 1760s. Its ruins still remain in a small field south of a warehouse at the intersection of Airport Road and Nor-Bath Blvd known as Franks Corner, Pennsylvania. The ruins include a series of small underground chambers. Only one of the original buildings stand, with the larger barn having collapsed or disassembled sometime after 1916. There is evidence of fire damage to the fort and surrounding trees.

On August 18, 2012, Bath celebrated its 275th anniversary. In 1999, the Bath Business and Community Partnership (BBCP) was established for managing urban revitalization initiatives, including creating a greener town, organizing volunteers, and developing economic restructuring/asset enhancement.

<doc id="133462" wikidata="Q179673" url="?curid=133462" title="Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)">
<text>Beauty and the Beast is a 1991 American animated musical romantic fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Based on the French fairy tale, it was directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise from a screenplay written by Linda Woolverton and produced by Don Hahn. Set in 18th-century France, an enchantress transforms a selfish prince into a monster as punishment for his cruelty. Years later, a young woman, Belle, offers the Beast her own freedom in exchange for her father&#x27;s. To break the spell, the Beast must earn Belle&#x27;s love before the last petal falls from his enchanted rose, lest he remain a monster forever. &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; stars the voices of Paige O&#x27;Hara and Robby Benson as Belle and the Beast, respectively, with a supporting cast comprising Richard White, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers, Jesse Corti, Rex Everhart, Jo Anne Worley, and Angela Lansbury.

Walt Disney unsuccessfully attempted to adapt &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; into an animated film during the 1930s and 1950s. Inspired by the success of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989), Disney enlisted Richard Purdum to adapt the fairy tale, which he originally conceived as a non-musical period drama. Dissatisfied with Purdum&#x27;s efforts, Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg ordered that the entire film be reworked into a musical with original songs by &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;″s songwriting team, lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken. First-time directors Trousdale and Wise replaced Purdum, and Woolverton&#x27;s involvement made &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; Disney&#x27;s first animated film to utilize a completed screenplay prior to storyboarding. The film was the second to use Computer Animation Production System (CAPS), which enabled seamless blending of traditional and computer animation, particularly during its ballroom scene. &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is dedicated to Ashman, who died from AIDS eight months before the film&#x27;s release.

An unfinished version of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; premiered at the New York Film Festival on September 29, 1991, before its wide release on November 22, 1991. The film received widespread acclaim for its story, characters, music, and animation, specifically for the ballroom sequence. With an initial worldwide gross of $331 million, it finished its run as the third highest-grossing film of 1991 and the first animated film to gross over $100 million in the United States. Subsequent re-releases (IMAX in 2002 and 3D in 2012) later increased the film&#x27;s all-time gross to $451 million. Among its accolades, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was the first animated film to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and the first to receive a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture. It ultimately won the Academy Awards for Best Original Score and Best Original Song (&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;) at the 64th ceremony, out of six nominations.

In 1994, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; became the first Disney film adapted into a Broadway musical, which won a Tony Award and ran for 13 years. Other derivate works include three direct-to-video sequels, a television series, and a 2017 live-action remake. In 2002, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time.

==Plot==
An enchantress disguised as an old beggar woman arrives at a castle and offers a cruel and selfish prince an enchanted rose in exchange for shelter from a storm. When he scornfully declines, she reveals her true form and transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects. To break the curse, the prince must learn to love someone and gain that person&#x27;s love before the last petal of the rose falls; otherwise, he will remain a beast forever.

Several years later, in a nearby village, Belle, the bookworm daughter of eccentric inventor Maurice, dreams of adventure while constantly rejecting advances from Gaston, an arrogant hunter. One day, Maurice travels to a local fair to present his latest invention, a wood-chopping machine, but becomes lost in the forest. Upon seeking refuge in the Beast&#x27;s castle, he is eventually detained for trespassing. After Belle finds Maurice locked in the castle dungeon, she offers to take his place as a prisoner; the Beast agrees.

Belle meets the castle&#x27;s servants, including candelabra Lumière, mantel clock Cogsworth, teapot Mrs. Potts, and her son Chip, a teacup. When she finds the enchanted rose, the Beast angrily forces her to flee outside. Wolves ambush Belle, and the Beast rescues her, getting injured in the process. As she nurses his wounds, they develop a rapport.

In the village, Maurice fails to convince the townsfolk of the Beast. Hearing Maurice&#x27;s statements, Gaston bribes Monsieur D&#x27;Arque, the warden of the local insane asylum, to have Maurice declared insane and locked up, which Gaston will use to blackmail Belle into marrying him in exchange for Maurice&#x27;s release. Before they can act, Maurice leaves to attempt a rescue alone.

Belle discovers Maurice&#x27;s predicament via a magic mirror. Out of his love for her, the Beast releases Belle to rescue him. Returning to town, Belle reveals the Beast via the mirror, shocking the townsfolk and proving her father&#x27;s sanity. Realizing she has fallen for the Beast, Gaston jealously has her thrown into the cellar with Maurice and rallies the villagers to kill the Beast. Chip, who stowed away when Belle left, frees the two with Maurice&#x27;s machine.

As the castle&#x27;s servants defeat the villagers, Gaston attacks the depressed Beast, who regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return and spares Gaston&#x27;s life, but Gaston fatally stabs him before losing his footing and falling to his demise. Belle tearfully professes her love to a dying Beast as the last petal falls, which undoes the curse, reviving the Beast and restoring him and his servants to their human forms. The prince and Belle later host a ball for the kingdom.

==Voice cast==

* Paige O&#x27;Hara as Belle, a bibliophilic young woman who seeks adventure and offers her own freedom to the Beast in return for her father&#x27;s. To &quot;enhance&quot; the character from the original story, the filmmakers felt that Belle should be &quot;unaware&quot; of her own beauty and made her &quot;a little odd&quot;. Wise recalls casting O&#x27;Hara because of a &quot;unique tone&quot; she had, &quot;a little bit of Judy Garland&quot;, after whose appearance Belle was modeled. James Baxter and Mark Henn served as the supervising animators for Belle.
* Robby Benson as the Beast, a young prince who is transformed into a talking beast by an enchantress as punishment for his arrogance and selfishness. The animators drew him with the head structure and horns of an American bison, the arms and body of a bear, the eyebrows of a gorilla, the teeth and mane of a lion, the tusks of a wild boar, and the legs and tail of a wolf. Chris Sanders, one of the film&#x27;s storyboard artists and visual development artists, drafted the designs for the Beast and came up with designs based on birds, insects, and fish before coming up with something close to the final design. Glen Keane, supervising animator for the Beast, refined the design by going to the zoo and studying the animals on which the Beast was based. Benson commented, &quot;There&#x27;s a rage and torment in this character I&#x27;ve never been asked to use before.&quot; The filmmakers commented that &quot;everybody was big fee-fi-fo-fum and gravelly&quot; while Benson had the &quot;big voice and the warm, accessible side&quot; so that &quot;you could hear the prince beneath the fur&quot;.
* Richard White as Gaston, a hunter who vies for Belle&#x27;s hand in marriage. He serves as a foil personality to the Beast, who was originally as egotistical as Gaston prior to saving Belle from the wolves. Gaston&#x27;s supervising animator, Andreas Deja, was pressed by Jeffrey Katzenberg to make Gaston handsome in contrast to the traditional appearance of a Disney villain, an assignment he found difficult at first. In the beginning, Gaston is depicted as more of a narcissist than a villain, but later he threatens to put Maurice in a mental institution if Belle does not marry him, and eventually leads all the villagers to kill the Beast, enraged that Belle would love a beast more than him.
* Jerry Orbach as Lumière, the kind-hearted but rebellious French-accented maître d&#x27; of the Beast&#x27;s castle, who has been transformed into a candelabra. He has a habit of disobeying his master&#x27;s strict rules, sometimes causing tension between them, but the Beast often turns to him for advice. He is depicted as flirtatious, as he is frequently seen with the Featherduster and immediately takes a liking to Belle. A running gag throughout the film is Lumière burning Cogsworth. Nik Ranieri served as the supervising animator for Lumière.
* David Ogden Stiers as Cogsworth, the Beast&#x27;s majordomo, the head butler of the household staff and Lumière&#x27;s best friend, who has been turned into a mantel clock. He is extremely loyal to the Beast so as to save himself and anyone else any trouble, often leading to friction between himself and Lumière. Will Finn served as the supervising animator for Cogsworth. Stiers also narrates the prologue.
* Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Potts, the housekeeper, turned into a teapot, who takes a motherly attitude toward Belle. The filmmakers went through several names for Mrs. Potts, such as &quot;Mrs. Chamomile&quot;, before Ashman suggested the use of simple and concise names for the household objects. David Pruiksma served as the supervising animator for Mrs. Potts. 
* Bradley Pierce as Chip, Mrs. Potts&#x27;s son, who has been transformed into a teacup. Originally intended to only have one line, the filmmakers were impressed with Pierce&#x27;s performance and expanded the character&#x27;s role significantly, eschewing a mute Music Box character. Pruiksma also served as the supervising animator for Chip.
* Rex Everhart as Maurice, Belle&#x27;s inventor father. The villagers see him as insane for crafting devices believed impossible to construct in reality, but his loyal daughter believes he will be famous one day. Ruben A. Aquino served as the supervising animator for Maurice.
* Jesse Corti as LeFou, Gaston&#x27;s sidekick. He looks up to Gaston as his hero, and sings a song with the other villagers to cheer him up. His name is French for &quot;The Madman&quot; and also a phonetic play on &quot;The Fool&quot;. Chris Wahl served as the supervising animator for LeFou.
* Jo Anne Worley as the Wardrobe, the castle&#x27;s authority over fashion, and a former opera singer, who has been turned into a wardrobe. The character of Wardrobe was introduced by visual development artist Sue C. Nichols to the then entirely male cast of servants, and was originally a more integral character named &quot;Madame Armoire&quot;. Wardrobe is known as &quot;Madame de la Grande Bouche&quot; (Madame Big Mouth) in the stage adaptation of the film and is the only major enchanted object character whose human form does not appear in the film. Tony Anselmo served as the supervising animator for the Wardrobe.
* Hal Smith as Philippe, Belle&#x27;s horse. Russ Edmonds served as the supervising animator for Philippe.
* Mary Kay Bergman and Kath Soucie as the Bimbettes, a trio of village maidens who constantly fawn over Gaston, known as the &quot;Silly Girls&quot; or &quot;Les Filles De La Ville&quot; (the village girls) in the stage adaptation.
* Jack Angel, Phil Proctor, Bill Farmer, and Patrick Pinney as Tom, Dick, Stanley, and Gramps, respectively, Gaston and LeFou&#x27;s circle of friends.
* Brian Cummings as the Stove, the castle&#x27;s chef who has been transformed into a stove. He is named Chef Bouche in 1998&#x27;s &quot;Belle&#x27;s Magical World&quot;.
* Alvin Epstein as the Bookseller, the owner of a book shop in Belle&#x27;s village.
* Tony Jay as Monsieur D&#x27;Arque, the sadistic warden of the Asylum de Loons. Gaston bribes him to help in his plan to blackmail Belle.
* Alec Murphy as the Baker, the owner of a bakery in Belle&#x27;s village.
* Kimmy Robertson as the Featherduster, a maid and Lumière&#x27;s sweetheart, who has been turned into a feather duster. She is never mentioned by name in the 1991 film (listed as Featherduster in the credits); Babette is the name given to this character later in the 1994 stage adaptation of the film; Fifi in the 1998 animated musical film &quot;Belle&#x27;s Magical World&quot; and Plumette in the 2017 live-action remake.
* Frank Welker as Sultan, the castle&#x27;s pet dog turned into a footstool.

==Production==

===Early versions===
Following the widespread critical and commercial success of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; in 1937, Walt Disney sought out other stories to adapt into feature films. Among the titles considered was Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont&#x27;s version of the &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; fairy tale. Walt attempted to adapt the story into an animated film during both the 1930s and 1950s, but efforts were shelved once the plot proved too challenging, particularly its second half. Author and film critic Peter M. Nichols suggested that Disney might have also been discouraged by the success of Jean Cocteau&#x27;s 1946 version.

Decades later, as &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; was nearing completion in 1987, the Disney studio resurrected &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; as a project for the satellite animation studio they established in London, England to work on &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot;. Richard Williams, who had directed the animated portions of &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot;, was approached to direct &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; but declined in favor of prioritizing his long-gestating project, &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot;. He suggested his colleague, English animation director Richard Purdum, in his place, and work began under producer Don Hahn on a non-musical version of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; set in 19th-century France.

At the behest of Disney CEO Michael Eisner, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; became the first Disney animated film to use a screenwriter in an official capacity. This was an unusual move for an animated film, which at this time were traditionally developed on storyboards rather than in a scripted form. After Linda Woolverton had written a spec script for a &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; project that was never developed, Katzenberg asked her to work on &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, with her earliest drafts being darker and non-musical. &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was Disney&#x27;s first animated film to use a completed script prior to storyboarding and animation. Woolverton said there was a significant learning curve on &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; because the new process was not explained to herself nor the story department who, prior to &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, would have done the screenwriting themselves.

===Script rewrite and musicalization===

Upon seeing the initial storyboard reels in 1989, Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg was dissatisfied with Purdum&#x27;s idea and ordered that the film be scrapped and started over from scratch. A few months after starting anew, Purdum resigned as director. The studio had approached John Musker and Ron Clements to direct the film, but they turned down the offer, saying they were &quot;tired&quot; after just having finished directing Disney&#x27;s recent success &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. Katzenberg then hired first-time feature directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale. Wise and Trousdale had previously directed the animated sections of &quot;Cranium Command&quot;, a short film for a Disney EPCOT theme park attraction. In addition, wanting another musical film, Katzenberg asked songwriters Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who had written the song score for &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, to turn &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; into a Broadway-style musical film in the same vein as &quot;Mermaid&quot;. Ashman, who at the time had learned he was dying of complications from AIDS, had been working with Disney on a pet project of his, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, and only reluctantly agreed to join the struggling production team. To accommodate Ashman&#x27;s failing health, pre-production of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was moved from London to the Residence Inn in Fishkill, New York, close to Ashman&#x27;s New York City home. Here, Ashman and Menken joined Wise, Trousdale, Hahn, and Woolverton in retooling the film&#x27;s script. Since the original story had only two major characters, the filmmakers enhanced them, added new characters in the form of enchanted household items who &quot;add warmth and comedy to a gloomy story&quot; and guide the audience through the film, and added a &quot;real villain&quot; in the form of Gaston.

The film also incorporates ideas from the 1946 French film directed by Jean Cocteau. These ideas were somewhat similar to elements of the 1946 French film version of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, which introduced the character of Avenant, an oafish suitor somewhat similar to Gaston, as well as inanimate objects coming to life in the Beast&#x27;s castle. The animated objects were, however, given distinct personalities in the Disney version. By early 1990, Katzenberg had approved the revised script, and storyboarding began again. The production flew story artists back and forth between California and New York for storyboard approvals from Ashman, though the team was not told the reason why.

===Casting and recording===
Disney had originally considered casting Jodi Benson from &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; as Belle. They eventually decided upon Broadway actress and singer Paige O&#x27;Hara in favor of having a heroine who sounded &quot;more like a woman than a girl&quot;. According to co-director Kirk Wise, O&#x27;Hara was given the role because she &quot;had a unique quality, a tone she would hit that made her special&quot;, reminiscent to that of American actress and singer Judy Garland. O&#x27;Hara, who, after reading about the film in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, competed for the role against 500 hopefuls, believes the fact that lyricist Howard Ashman admired her cast recording of the musical &quot;Show Boat&quot; proved integral in her being cast. O&#x27;Hara modeled her interpretation of Belle after the spirited performance of Katharine Hepburn in &quot;Little Women&quot; (1933).

Laurence Fishburne, Val Kilmer and Mandy Patinkin were originally considered to voice the Beast, the role was eventually given to actor Robby Benson. John Cleese was originally intended to voice Cogsworth, but later turned it down to voice Cat. R. Waul in the Universal Pictures animated film &quot;An American Tail: Fievel Goes West&quot;, and the role was eventually given to David Ogden Stiers. Julie Andrews was originally considered to voice Mrs. Potts, but the role was eventually given to Angela Lansbury.

===Animation===
Production of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was to be completed on a compressed timeline of two years rather than the traditional four-year Disney Feature Animation production schedule; this was due to the loss of production time spent developing the earlier Purdum version of the film. Most of the production was done at the main Feature Animation studio, housed in the Air Way facility in Glendale, California. A smaller team at the Disney-MGM Studios theme park in Lake Buena Vista, Florida assisted the California team on several scenes, particularly the &quot;Be Our Guest&quot; number.

&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was the second film, after &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot;, produced using CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar. The software allowed for a wider range of colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the early 1960s. CAPS/ink &amp; paint also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away from the camera on the Z-axis to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.

In addition, CAPS/ink &amp; paint allowed an easier combination of hand-drawn art with computer-generated imagery, which before had to be plotted to animation paper and then xeroxed and painted traditionally. This technique was put to significant use during the &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; waltz sequence, in which Belle and Beast dance through a computer-generated ballroom as the camera dollies around them in simulated 3D space. The filmmakers had originally decided against the use of computers in favor of traditional animation, but later, when the technology had improved, decided it could be used for the one scene in the ballroom. Before that, CGI environments had first been printed out as wireframe, but this was the first time Disney made use of 3D rendering. The success of the ballroom sequence helped convince studio executives to further invest in computer animation. The technology hardware that was used for the CGI was SGI, and the software that was used is Pixar&#x27;s RenderMan.

The final dance between Belle and the Prince was reused from the final dance sequence between Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip from the 1959 film &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. According to Trousdale, this was done because production of the film was nearing the deadline, and this was the easiest way to do that sequence.

===Music===

Ashman and Menken wrote the &quot;Beauty&quot; song score during the pre-production process in Fishkill, the opening operetta-styled &quot;Belle&quot; being their first composition for the film. Other songs included &quot;Be Our Guest&quot;, sung (in its original version) to Maurice by the objects when he becomes the first visitor to eat at the castle in a decade, &quot;Gaston&quot;, a solo for the swaggering villain and his bumbling sidekick, &quot;Human Again&quot;, a song describing Belle and Beast&#x27;s growing love from the objects&#x27; perspective, the love ballad &quot;Beauty and the Beast (Tale as Old as Time)&quot; and the climactic &quot;The Mob Song&quot;. As story and song development came to a close, full production began in Burbank while voice and song recording began in New York City. The &quot;Beauty&quot; songs were mostly recorded live with the orchestra and the voice cast performing simultaneously rather than overdubbed separately, in order to give the songs a cast album-like &quot;energy&quot; the filmmakers and songwriters desired.

During the course of production, many changes were made to the structure of the film, necessitating the replacement and re-purposing of songs. After screening a mostly animated version of the &quot;Be Our Guest&quot; sequence, story artist Bruce Woodside suggested that the objects should be singing the song to Belle rather than her father. Wise and Trousdale agreed, and the sequence and song were retooled to replace Maurice with Belle. The film&#x27;s title song went through a noted bit of uncertainty during production. Originally conceived as a rock-oriented song, it was changed to a slow, romantic ballad. Howard Ashman and Alan Menken asked Angela Lansbury to perform the song, but she did not think her voice was suited for the melody.

When she voiced her doubts, Menken and Ashman asked her for at least one take and told her to perform the song as she saw fit. Lansbury reportedly reduced everyone in the studio to tears with her rendition, nailing the song in the one take asked of her. This version went on to win the Oscar for Best Original Song. &quot;Human Again&quot; was dropped from the film before animation began, as its lyrics caused story problems about the timeline over which the story takes place. This required Ashman and Menken to write a new song in its place. &quot;Something There&quot;, in which Belle and Beast sing (via voiceover) of their growing fondness for each other, was composed late in production and inserted into the script in place of &quot;Human Again&quot;.

Menken would later revise &quot;Human Again&quot; for inclusion in the 1994 Broadway stage version of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, and another revised version of the song was added to the film itself in a new sequence created for the film&#x27;s Special Edition re-release in 2002. Ashman died of AIDS-related complications at the age of 40 on March 14, 1991, eight months before the film&#x27;s release. He never saw the finished film, though he did get to see it in its unfinished format. Ashman&#x27;s work on &quot;Aladdin&quot; was completed by another lyricist, Tim Rice. Before Ashman&#x27;s death, members of the film&#x27;s production team visited him after the film&#x27;s well-received first screening, with Don Hahn commenting that &quot;the film would be a great success. Who&#x27;d have thought it?&quot; Ashman replied, &quot;I would&quot;.

A tribute to the lyricist was included at the end of the credits crawl: &quot;To our friend, Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul, we will be forever grateful. Howard Ashman 1950–1991&quot;. A pop version of the &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; theme, performed by Céline Dion and Peabo Bryson over the end credits, was released as a commercial single from the film&#x27;s soundtrack, supported with a music video. The Dion/Bryson version of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; became an international pop hit and performed considerably well on charts around the world. The song became Dion&#x27;s second single to land within the top-10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number nine. The song peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Adult Contemporary chart. In Canada, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; peaked at number two. Outside of North America, the song peaked within the top ten in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, while peaking within the top twenty in Australia, Netherlands, and Ireland. The song sold over a million copies worldwide. This version of the song was also nominated for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Duo/Group Vocal Performance at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards, winning the latter.

==Release==

===Work-in-progress and original theatrical run===
Disney made a concerted effort to market the film towards both children and adults, arguably more-so than they had done with any previous animated film from the studio. To appeal to adult audiences, the approach involved blending live-action filmmaking techniques with animation, crafting a narrative that resonates with mature perspectives, and evoking nostalgia among baby boomers through a classic Broadway-style soundtrack. The film also employed two distinct main theatrical posters, one showcasing colorful, child-friendly artwork featuring the ensemble of animated characters; the other presents a darker, more subdued image of the title characters dancing in silhouette, which Disney placed in newspaper ads to appeal to adult readers.

In a first-time accomplishment for The Walt Disney Company, an unfinished version of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was shown at the New York Film Festival on September 29, 1991. The film was deemed a &quot;work in progress&quot; because roughly only 70% of the animation had been completed; storyboards and pencil tests were used in replacement of the remaining 30%. Additionally, certain segments of the film that had already been finished were reverted to previous stages of completion. At the end of the screening, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; received enthusiastic reviews and a ten-minute-long standing ovation from the film festival audience. The completed film was also screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival. The finished film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on November 13, 1991, beginning a limited release before expanding wide on November 22, along with &quot;An American Tail: Fievel Goes West&quot;.

===Reissues===
The film was restored and remastered for its New Year&#x27;s Day, 2002 re-release in IMAX theatres in a special-edition edit, including a new musical sequence. Although Disney&#x27;s anthology film &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; was the first feature-length animated film to be released in IMAX, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was the first narrative film to receive a major IMAX release. For this version of the film, much of the animation was cleaned up, a new sequence set to the deleted song &quot;Human Again&quot; was inserted into the film&#x27;s second act, and a new digital master from the original CAPS production files was used to make the high-resolution IMAX film negative.

A sing-along edition, hosted by Jordin Sparks, was released in select theaters on September 29 and October 2, 2010. Prior to the showing, Sparks showed an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the newly restored film and the making of her new &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; music video. There was also commentary from producer Hahn, interviews with the cast and an inside look at how the animation was created.

A Disney Digital 3D version, the second of a traditionally animated film, was originally scheduled to be released in US theatres on February 12, 2010, but the project was postponed, first to 2011 and then to 2012. On August 25, 2011, Disney announced that the 3D version would make its American debut at Hollywood&#x27;s El Capitan Theatre from September 2–15, 2011. Disney spent less than $10 million on the 3D conversion. After the successful 3D re-release of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, Disney announced a wide 3D re-release of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in North America beginning January 13, 2012.

To celebrate Disney&#x27;s 100th anniversary, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was re-released in selected Cinemark theaters from August 18 to 31, 2023, across the United Kingdom from September 22 to 28, and in Helios theaters across Poland on October 7.

===Home media===
On October 30, 1992, in the United States and Canada, Walt Disney Home Video (currently known as Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment) released the film to VHS, Beta and LaserDisc as part of the Walt Disney Classics series, and later put it on moratorium on April 30, 1993, it was not included in the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection line. The &quot;work-in-progress&quot; version screened at the New York Film Festival was also released on VHS and LaserDisc at this time; however, said version was the only one available on the latter format until the fall of 1993, when the completed theatrical version was released. This measure was to diminish the threat of video pirates making copies derived from the LaserDisc (which are not copy-protected) and selling them in international markets, where the film was yet to be available for home release. By October 1993, the VHS sold a record 20–22 million units. In 1993, the film was also released on home video in different countries, including the United Kingdom on September 20 of that year, and sold a record 8.5 million units.

&quot;Beauty and the Beast: Special Edition&quot;, as the enhanced version of the film released in IMAX/large-format is called, was released on a THX certified &quot;Platinum Edition&quot; two-disc DVD and VHS on October 8, 2002. The DVD set features three versions of the film: the extended IMAX Special Edition with the &quot;Human Again&quot; sequence added, the original theatrical version, and the New York Film Festival &quot;work-in-progress&quot; version. This release went to &quot;Disney Vault&quot; moratorium status in January 2003, along with its direct-to-video follow-ups &quot;Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas&quot; and &quot;Belle&#x27;s Magical World&quot;. The Special Edition DVD was released on November 2, 2002, in the United Kingdom, while the other 50 international territories released on Autumn 2002 as &quot;Special Limited Edition&quot;.

The film was released from the vault on October 5, 2010, as the second of Disney&#x27;s Diamond Editions, in the form of a three-disc Blu-ray Disc and DVD combination pack—the first release of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; on home video in high-definition format. This edition consists of four versions of the film: the original theatrical version, an extended version, the New York Film Festival storyboard-only version, and a fourth iteration displaying the storyboards via picture-in-picture alongside the original theatrical version. Upon its first week of release, the Blu-ray sold 1.1 million units, topping the Blu-ray sales chart and finishing in third place on the combined Blu-ray and DVD sales chart for the week ending on October 10, 2010. It was the second-best-selling Blu-ray of 2010, behind &quot;Avatar&quot;. A two-disc DVD edition was released on November 23, 2010. A five-disc combo pack, featuring Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray 2D, DVD and a digital copy, was released on October 4, 2011. The 3D combo pack is identical to the original Diamond Edition, except for the added 3D disc and digital copy.

===Critical response===
Upon its release, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was universally praised for its script, animation, characters, and music. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a approval rating based on reviews, with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Enchanting, sweepingly romantic, and featuring plenty of wonderful musical numbers, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is one of Disney&#x27;s most elegant animated offerings.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade. The film also holds a score of 95/100 on review aggregator Metacritic, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. It is the fifth best-reviewed film from Walt Disney Animation Studios on the platform.

For &quot;The New York Times&quot;, journalist Janet Maslin compared &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; to &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and observed areas where Disney borrowed inspiration from its predecessor to replicate its success, concluding, &quot;Now, lightning has definitely struck twice with &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film a perfect score and likened it to Disney classics such as &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; and &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940). He wrote, &quot;&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; reaches back to an older and healthier Hollywood tradition in which the best writers, musicians, and filmmakers are gathered for a project on the assumption that a family audience deserves great entertainment, too&quot;. James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; hailed &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; as &quot;the finest animated movie ever made&quot;, praising its romance, music, inventiveness, and animation. Berardinelli was among many critics who singled out its use of computer animation—particularly in the ballroom sequence—as a highlight.

Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a near-masterpiece that draws on the sublime traditions of the past while remaining completely in sync with the sensibility of its time&quot;. Michael Sragow complimented its animation, characterization of Belle and the Beast, musical numbers, and voice acting, calling the film &quot;a zesty charmer with a solid story and hip filigree&quot;, and Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; declared it &quot;one of the year&#x27;s most entertaining films&quot;. Siskel also believed &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; would revive the movie musical, a genre he said had been in decline for the past 20 years. On their &quot;Siskel&quot; &quot;and Ebert&quot; show, both he and Ebert declared the film a &quot;legitimate contender for Oscar consideration as Best Picture of the Year&quot;. Meanwhile, John Hartl of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; praised the animators and voice actors for making audiences care about the their characters. Jay Boyar of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; added that the film &quot;has a beauty of a bite,&quot; commending Disney&#x27;s attempt to tell a darker fairy tale in its use of themes and art direction. When animation historian Charles Solomon reviewed the IMAX re-release in 2001, he said that &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; &quot; has the strongest claim to being a classic&quot; of all the films Disney released during the 1980s and 1990s.

Some critics were more reserved in their praise. Film critic Dave Kehr described the film as &quot;adequate holiday entertainment for children and their more indulgent parents&quot; but lacking the technical mastery and emotional depth of Disney&#x27;s earlier work. Owen Gleiberman said that although the film delivers nearly everything &quot;you want-and expect-from a new animated feature by Walt Disney Studios&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; lacks the heart and yearning of earlier efforts, deeming the Beast in particular underdeveloped. Animation historian Michael Barrier commented on Belle&#x27;s character, noting that her intellect seems more symbolic—&quot;hanging out with books&quot; rather than engaging deeply with them—but acknowledged that the film pushes closer to the challenges tackled by the finest Walt Disney features. Cultural and thematic observations also stood out among scholars. David Whitley noted that Belle&#x27;s independence marked a departure from earlier Disney heroines, as she was largely free from domestic chores and embodied a modern adolescent&#x27;s undefined role. Whitley also highlighted the film&#x27;s feminist undertones, critical view of Gaston&#x27;s chauvinism, and the cyborg-like portrayal of the enchanted servants. Eric Smoodin reflected on how the film merges traditional fairy tales with feminism and technological innovation, suggesting its &quot;greatness could be proved in terms of technology, narrative, or even politics.&quot;

===Accolades===
 Alan Menken and Howard Ashman&#x27;s song &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, while Menken&#x27;s score won the award for Best Original Score. Two other Menken and Ashman songs from the film, &quot;Belle&quot; and &quot;Be Our Guest&quot;, were also nominated for Best Original Song. &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was the first picture to receive three Academy Award nominations for Best Original Song, a feat that would be repeated by &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; (2006), and &quot;Enchanted&quot; (2007). Academy rules have since been changed to limit each film to two nominations in this category, due to the consecutive unintentional failures of &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; and &quot;Enchanted&quot; to win the award.

The film was also nominated for Best Picture and Best Sound. It was the first animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture, and remained the only animated film nominated until the 2009 nominee &quot;Up,&quot; after the Best Picture field had been widened to ten nominees. Thus, it remains the only animated film nominated for the award when only five nominees were allowed. It was the third Disney film ever to be nominated for Best Picture, following &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964) and &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; (1989). It became the first musical in twelve years to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture of the Year, following &quot;All That Jazz&quot; (1979), and the last one to be nominated until &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (2001), ten years later. It lost the Best Picture award to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; and the Best Sound award to &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. With six nominations, the film currently shares the record for the most nominations for an animated film with &quot;WALL-E&quot; (2008), although, with three nominations in the Best Original Song category, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;″s nominations span only four categories, while &quot;WALL-E&quot;″s nominations cover six individual categories.

While &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was the first to be nominated, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; became the first animated film to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. This feat was later repeated by &quot;The Lion King&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is widely regarded as a groundbreaking animated film due to its unprecedented combination of critical acclaim, box office success, accolades, and overall cultural impact. As one of the earliest animated films to embrace computer animation, it represents a pivotal transition between Disney&#x27;s traditionally animated works and what would evolve into the artistic standard for modern animation, merging &quot;the elegant simplicity of Disney&#x27;s early fairy tales with elevated character development&quot;, according to &quot;IndieWire&quot;. Film critics and scholars recognize &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; for its innovative use of animation techniques achieved by blending traditional animation with computer-generated imagery, particularly exemplified by the ballroom sequence. Film critic Richard Corliss said that, only four years later, Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story&quot; would take full advantage of the computer animation foundation laid by &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. Retrospective reviewers agree that &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; further evolved how Disney would depict female leads in their princess-themed films, being considered as much a departure from &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1950) and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; as it was an influence on &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998) and &quot;Moana&quot; (2016).

Although &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; had been a significant achievement in restoring Disney&#x27;s animation department, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; would serve as the crucial follow-up test to prove whether Disney&#x27;s resurgence was long-lasting, especially following the underperformance of &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot;. The film&#x27;s success ultimately cemented Disney&#x27;s return to dominating the animation industry by trailblazing the Disney Renaissance. Journalist and filmmaker Bilge Ebiri identifies &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, particularly its unfinished screening at the 1991 New York Film Festival, as a turning point in shifting the public stigma that had dismissed animated films as mere children&#x27;s entertainment for decades. This event, he argues, helped critics and audiences recognize the complexity, artistry, and decision-making involved in animation, paving the way for the medium&#x27;s acceptance as legitimate cinema. Similarly, Emma Cochrane of &quot;Empire&quot; wrote in a 2000 review that &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; signals the beginning of the public referring to animated films as &quot;animated features&quot; instead of &quot;cartoons&quot;, which was encouraged by the film&#x27;s animation, music, and storytelling appealing to adults arguably more than any prior animated film. According to Bill Gibron of &quot;PopMatters&quot;, the film&#x27;s Best Picture Oscar nomination transcended categorical limitations, legitimizing animated films as serious contenders at the Academy Awards beyond musical and technical categories, and paving the way for future animated films to compete for Best Picture. The high standard set by the film continues to impact current Disney projects. According to Bruce Westbrook of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; remains Disney&#x27;s &quot;crowning achievement&quot;, crediting it with cementing the studio&#x27;s Broadway-style approach to animated musicals that would ultimately inspire their own stage adaptations. Additionally, writers for &quot;IndieWire&quot; believe the ballroom sequence alone &quot;deserves to be recognized as one of the great moments in movie history&quot;.

&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; has been described by critics and journalists as one of Disney&#x27;s greatest films. Filmsite declared &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; &quot;Arguably the most successful Disney animated film of all time&quot;. &quot;Consequence&quot; ranked it the best film of the Disney Renaissance. Several publications have ranked it among the studio&#x27;s best work, including &quot;The Independent&quot; (2), &quot;IGN&quot; (2), &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; (2), &quot;Paste&quot; (2), &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; (4), and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (10), while Leah Pickett of &quot;Consequence&quot; described it as arguably &quot;the most critically lauded animated film of the 20th century&quot;. In 2010, &quot;IGN&quot; named &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; the greatest animated film of all-time. Several media organizations have ranked the film among the greatest animated films of all-time, including &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;IndieWire&quot; (4), &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; (5), &quot;Parade&quot; (5), &quot;Time Out&quot; (11), &quot;Empire&quot; (20), and &quot;IGN&quot; (21). According to research conducted by 24/7 Wall Street based on online critic and audience ratings, and reported by &quot;USA Today&quot; in 2018, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is the 37th best animated film of all-time.

In 2002, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its &quot;Ten Top Ten&quot; lists of the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres, based on polls of over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was acknowledged as the seventh-best film in the animation genre. In previous lists, it ranked number 22 on the institute&#x27;s list of best musicals and number 34 on its list of the best romantic American films. On the list of the greatest songs from American films, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; ranked number 62.

===Broadway musical===

According to an article in the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, &quot;The catalyst for Disney&#x27;s braving the stage was an article by &quot;The New York Times&quot; theater critic Frank Rich that praised &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; as 1991&#x27;s best musical. Theatre Under The Stars (TUTS) executive director Frank Young had been trying to get Disney interested in a stage version of &quot;Beauty&quot; about the same time Eisner and Katzenberg were mulling over Rich&#x27;s column. But Young couldn&#x27;t seem to get in touch with the right person in the Disney empire. Nothing happened till the Disney execs started to pursue the project from their end. When they asked George Ives, the head of Actors Equity on the West Coast, which Los Angeles theater would be the best venue for launching a new musical, Ives said the best theater for that purpose would be TUTS. Not long after that, Disney&#x27;s Don Frantz and Bettina Buckley contacted Young, and the partnership was under way.&quot; A stage condensation of the film, directed by Robert Jess Roth and choreographed by Matt West, both of whom moved on to the Broadway development, had already been presented at Disneyland at what was then called the Videopolis stage. &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; premiered in a joint production of Theatre Under The Stars and Disney Theatricals at the Music Hall, Houston, Texas, from November 28, 1993, through December 26, 1993.

On April 18, 1994, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; premiered on Broadway at the Palace Theatre in New York City to mixed reviews. The show transferred to the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on November 11, 1999. The commercial success of the show led to productions in the West End, Toronto, and all over the world. The Broadway version, which ran for over a decade, received a Tony Award, and became the first of a whole line of Disney stage productions. The original Broadway cast included Terrence Mann as the Beast, Susan Egan as Belle, Burke Moses as Gaston, Gary Beach as Lumière, Heath Lamberts as Cogsworth, Tom Bosley as Maurice, Beth Fowler as Mrs. Potts, and Stacey Logan as Babette the feather duster. Many well-known actors and singers also starred in the Broadway production during its thirteen-year run, including Kerry Butler, Deborah Gibson, Toni Braxton, Andrea McArdle, Jamie-Lynn Sigler, Christy Carlson Romano, Ashley Brown, and Anneliese van der Pol as Belle; Chuck Wagner, James Barbour, and Jeff McCarthy as the Beast; Meshach Taylor, Patrick Page, Bryan Batt, Jacob Young, and John Tartaglia as Lumière; Marc Kudisch, Christopher Sieber, and Donny Osmond as Gaston; and Nick Jonas, Harrison Chad, and Andrew Keenan-Bolger as Chip. The show ended its Broadway run on July 29, 2007, after 46 previews and 5,461 performances. , it is Broadway&#x27;s tenth-longest-running show in history.

===Live-action film===

In June 2014, Walt Disney Pictures announced that a live-action film adaptation of the original animated film was in the works, with Bill Condon directing and Evan Spiliotopoulos penning the screenplay. Condon originally planned on not only drawing inspiration from the animated film, but also to include most, if not all, of the Menken/Rice songs from the Broadway musical, with the intention of making the film as a &quot;straight-forward, live-action, large-budget movie musical&quot;. In September 2014, it was announced that Stephen Chbosky would re-write the script. In January 2015, Emma Watson announced via her Facebook page that she would portray Belle in the live-action film.

In March 2015, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, Emma Thompson, Josh Gad, Audra McDonald, and Kevin Kline joined the film as the Beast, Gaston, Mrs. Potts, Lefou, Garderobe, and Maurice, respectively. The following month, Ian McKellen, Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw joined the cast, as Cogsworth, Lumière, Cadenza, and Plumette, respectively. Composer Alan Menken returned to score the film&#x27;s music, with new material written by Menken and Tim Rice. In June 2015, Menken said the film would not include the songs that were written for the Broadway musical. Filming began on May 18, 2015, in London, and at Shepperton Studios in Surrey. Production officially wrapped in August 2015. The film was released on March 17, 2017.

===Video games===
The first video game based on the film was titled &quot;Beauty and the Beast: Belle&#x27;s Quest&quot; and is an action platformer for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. Developed by Software Creations, the game was released in North America in 1993. It is one of two video games based on the film that Sunsoft published for the Mega Drive/Genesis, the other being &quot;Beauty and The Beast: Roar of the Beast&quot;. Characters from the film like Gaston can help the player past tricky situations. As Belle, the player must reach the Beast&#x27;s castle and break the spell to live happily ever after. To succeed, she must explore the village, forest, castle, and snowy forest to solve puzzles and mini-games while ducking or jumping over enemies. Belle&#x27;s health is represented by a stack of blue books, which diminishes when she touches bats, rats, and other hazards in the game. Extra lives, keys and other items are hidden throughout the levels. While there is no continue or game saving ability, players can use a code to start the game at any of the seven levels.

The second video game based on the film was titled &quot;Beauty and the Beast: Roar of the Beast&quot; and is a side-scrolling video game for the Genesis. As the Beast, the player must successfully complete several levels, based on scenes from the film, in order to protect the castle from invading villagers and forest animals and rescue Belle from Gaston.

The third and fourth video games based on the film are action platformers developed by Probe Software and published by Hudson Soft. One, titled &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, was released in Europe in 1994 for the NES, while the other, &quot;Disney&#x27;s Beauty and the Beast&quot;, was released in North America in July 1994 and in Europe on February 23, 1995, for the SNES. The entire games are played through the perspective of the Beast. As the Beast, the player must get Belle to fall in love so that the curse cast upon him and his castle will be broken. The final boss of the game is Gaston. The Beast can walk, jump, swipe, stomp, super stomp, and roar, the last of which is used to both damage enemies and reveal hidden objects.

The fifth video game based on the film was titled &quot;Disney&#x27;s Beauty and the Beast: A Board Game Adventure&quot; and is a Disney Boardgame adventure for the Game Boy Color. It was released on October 25, 1999.

The video game series &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; features a world based on the film, named &quot;Beast&#x27;s Castle&quot;, along with several of the film&#x27;s characters. In the first game, the world has been destroyed and Belle kidnapped by the Heartless, led by Maleficent, but the Beast travels to Maleficent&#x27;s stronghold and works with Sora to defeat Maleficent and rescue Belle and the other captured princesses. In &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, the world has since been restored following Ansem&#x27;s defeat, but Beast and Belle are having difficulties due to the enigmatic Xaldin of Organization XIII attempting to bring out the Beast&#x27;s darker side in order to turn him into a Heartless and a Nobody, but the Beast eventually comes to his senses and works with Sora once again to defeat Xaldin once and for all. In the game&#x27;s ending credits, the Beast turns back into the Prince. In &quot;Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days&quot;, the world is featured as a playable level but the story is not essential to the main plot. In &quot;Kingdom Hearts χ&quot;, the world is featured again, this time as a hallucination that follows the plot of the movie more closely. The characters featured in the series are Beast, Belle, Lumière, Gaston, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip, Maurice, and the Wardrobe. After Gaston is defeated, the Beast transforms back into the Prince. Gaston does not appear in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, the world&#x27;s primary antagonist being Xaldin, an original character created for the series, but who shares several traits with Forte, the main antagonist of &quot;Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas&quot;.

==Sequels==
The success of the film spawned three direct-to-video sequels: &quot;Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas&quot; (1997), &quot;Beauty and the Beast: Belle&#x27;s Magical World&quot; (1998), and the prequel &quot;Belle&#x27;s Tales of Friendship&quot; (1999). All three take place in the timeline of the original. These were followed by a live-action spin-off television series, &quot;Sing Me a Story with Belle&quot;.

<text>East Allen Township is a township in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population of East Allen Township was 5,010 at the 2020 census. East Allen is part of the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th-most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. as of the 2020 census.

==Geography==

Its villages include Franks Corner, Jacksonville, Jamesville (also in Moore Township), Seemsville (also in Allen Township), and Weaversville (also in Allen Township).

==History==
Craig&#x27;s Scotch-Irish Settlement was established in 1728, and is the oldest permanent settlement in Northampton County along the Catasauqua Creek. In 1730 they started meeting as a congregation in homes. The Scotch-Irish Presbyterians of Allen Township established a church, in 1731, made of logs. The present church (now God&#x27;s Missionary Church) was built in 1813. It is the 3rd church that was built by the Presbyterians. East Allen Township was established in 1842 from what was Allen Twp. With the new township boundaries, the settlement is now located in East Allen Township at 4965 Nor-Bath Blvd. in Northampton, PA 18067 (between Bath and Northampton).

At the start of the Revolutionary War, John Ralston was the auditor of depreciations, George Palmer was coroner, William McNair and Jacob Horner were justices of the peace. Neigal Gray and John Ralston attended the provincial conference held in Carpenter&#x27;s Hall. Ralston and Robert Lattimore were members of the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Arthur Lattimore, Neigal Gray, and John Hays, Jr. were on the Standing Committee of Correspondence.

Thomas Craig and John Craig served as the area&#x27;s Lieutenants. Sub Lt.s were Arthur Lattimore and John Hays. John Ralston served as paymaster. William McNair was an agent for Forfeited Properties. Robert Lattimore was a Commissioner to collect clothing. Arthur Lattimore was a Justice of the Courts of General Quarter Sessions and of Common Pleas. John Hays, Jr. was a member of the Commission of Observation.

Northampton County was formed in 1752, which included the settlement that was already 24 years old. Many of them held the first county offices in Easton. William Craig and J. Lattimore were Prothonotary and Clerks of Quarter Sessions. Built in 1757, Fort Ralston is located near Bath and was built to protect settlers from Indian attacks during the French and Indian War. The fort is near the present intersection of Route 329 and Airport Road in a farmer&#x27;s field. It is still standing, however quite damaged.

The first official burial in Horner&#x27;s Cemetery was in 1745, but a baby in the old section makes it the oldest cemetery in Northampton County. Horner&#x27;s Cemetery contains the graves of many of the region&#x27;s earliest inhabitants, including 21 veterans from four U.S. wars. There is a stone for Robert Brown, a lieutenant colonel in George Washington&#x27;s Flying Camp, who served in Pennsylvania&#x27;s State Assembly and then the U.S. Congress after his service in the American Revolutionary War. Brown also owned the Friendship Tree. George Palmer, Deputy Surveyor-General of Pennsylvania, and Surgeon-General Dr. Matthew McHenry are both buried there. James Ralston also laid out the town of Bath and Gen. William Lattimore owned the first house there. Hugh Wilson was the founder of Northampton. All four are buried at Horner&#x27;s Cemetery. The cemetery has been restored by local members of the community, starting in 2008. The Horner Cemetery Historical Society was formed in 2011.

<text>Easton is a city in and the county seat of Northampton County, Pennsylvania, United States. The city&#x27;s population was 28,127 as of the 2020 census. Easton is located at the confluence of the Lehigh River, a river that joins the Delaware River in Easton and serves as the city&#x27;s eastern geographic boundary with Phillipsburg, New Jersey.

Easton is the easternmost city in the Lehigh Valley, a region of that is Pennsylvania&#x27;s third-largest and the nation&#x27;s 68th-largest metropolitan region with 861,889 residents as of the U.S. 2020 census. Of the Valley&#x27;s three major cities, Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton, Easton is the smallest with approximately one-fourth the population of Allentown, the Valley&#x27;s largest city.

The greater Easton area includes the city of Easton, three townships (Forks, Palmer, and Williams), and three boroughs (Glendon, West Easton, and Wilson). Centre Square, the city&#x27;s town square in its downtown neighborhood, is home to the Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument, a memorial for Easton area veterans killed during the American Civil War. In the first half of the 20th century, Centre Square was referred to locally as the Circle. The Peace Candle, a candle-like structure, is assembled and disassembled every year atop the Civil War monument for the Christmas season.

Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Lehigh Line, formerly the main line of the Lehigh Valley Railroad, runs through Easton on its way to Bethlehem and Allentown heading west across the Delaware River to Phillipsburg, New Jersey. Easton is located northeast of Allentown, north of Philadelphia, and west of New York City.

==Etymology==
On August 22, 1751, Thomas Penn, the son of William Penn, the colony&#x27;s founder and original proprietor married Juliana Fermor. On September 8, 1751, a letter was sent to Colonial Governor James Hamilton by Penn requesting that a new town on the confluence of the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers be named Easton and that it be in a new county called Northampton. In 1752, as requested, the city was named in honor of Lady Juliana&#x27;s family estate, the Easton Neston. The county was named after the estate&#x27;s location, which was in the south of Northamptonshire, England.

==History==
The Lenape Native Americans originally referred to present-day Easton and its surrounding region as Lechauwitank, meaning &quot;the Place at the Forks&quot;.

===18th century===
The land that includes present-day Easton was obtained from the Lenape in the Walking Purchase in 1737. A plaque commemorating the transaction appears in Easton&#x27;s town square.

Thomas Penn set aside a tract of land at the confluence of the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers for the town&#x27;s establishment, and the city was formally founded in 1752. The same year, Easton was selected as the county seat of Northampton County.

During the French and Indian War, the Treaty of Easton was signed in Easton by the British colonial government then governing the Province of Pennsylvania and the Native American tribes, including the Shawnee and Lenape, from what was then called Ohio Country.

Easton and the broader Lehigh Valley region played an instrumental and supportive role during the American Revolution, which commenced in 1775. In recognition of the strong pro-revolutionary sentiment in the city and region, Easton was one of only three designated locations, along with Philadelphia and Trenton, New Jersey, where the Declaration of Independence was read aloud in public for the first time on July 8, 1776, at noon, four days following its unanimous passage by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia. During the Declaration&#x27;s reading in Easton, the Easton flag was flown, making it one of the first non-colonial flags to fly in the Thirteen Colonies. The same flag was later used by a militia during the War of 1812 and currently serves as Easton&#x27;s municipal flag.

Easton maintained hospital used in the treatment of injured Continental Army soldiers during the war. On June 18, 1779, General John Sullivan led 2,500 Continental Army soldiers from Easton to engage Indian allies of the British Army on the frontier.

===19th century===
Located at the confluence of the rapidly flowing Lehigh River and the deeper and wider Delaware River, Easton became a major commercial center during the canal and railroad periods of the 19th century and a transportation hub for the region&#x27;s coal, iron, and steel industries. The Delaware Canal was built soon after the lower Lehigh Canal was opened in 1818 and became effective in delivering much-needed anthracite coal to the region&#x27;s largest markets, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and New York City.

Seeing other ways of exploiting the new fuel source, other entrepreneurs quickly moved to connect across the Delaware River reaching into the New York City area to the east through the Morris Canal in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, so the town became a canal hub from which coal from Mauch Chunk reached the world. Early railroads were often built to parallel this transportation corridor.

Historians of angling believe that, in 1845, Samuel Phillipe, an Easton gunsmith, invented the six-strip split-cane bamboo fly rod, which is commemorated by a Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission plaque near Easton&#x27;s Center Square.

By the late 1860s, the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad (LH&amp;S) and Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR) were built to augment the bulk traffic through the canals and provide lucrative passenger travel services. The LVRR, known as the Black Diamond Line operated twice daily express passenger trains to and from New York City and Buffalo, New York via Easton. The Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ), leased and operated the LH&amp;S tracks from the 1870s until the Conrail consolidations absorbed both the Central Railroad of New Jersey and Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1966. Today, the Lehigh Valley Railroad&#x27;s main line is the only major rail line that goes through Easton and is now known as the Lehigh Line; the Lehigh Line was bought by the Norfolk Southern Railway in 1999.

In the mid-19th century, canal transportation was largely replaced by railroads, and Easton became a hub for five railroads, including the Jersey Central, Lehigh Valley Railroad, and others. Easton lost its prominence in passenger transportation with the rise of the automobile in the mid-20th century.

===20th and 21st centuries===

Like the Pennsylvania Dutch region to the southwest, Easton was settled largely by Germans. The &quot;Pennsylvania Argus&quot;, a German language newspaper, was published in Easton until 1917. As part of their heritage, the Germans put up one of the continent&#x27;s earliest Christmas trees in Easton; Daniel Foley&#x27;s book states that, &quot;Another diary reference unearthed recently makes mention of a tree set-up at Easton, Pennsylvania, in 1816.&quot; A plaque in Scott Park along the Delaware River commemorates this event. The Pennsylvania guide, compiled by the Writers&#x27; Program of the Works Progress Administration in 1940, described the rich and cosmopolitan fabric of Easton&#x27;s society in the first half of the 20th century:

On December 16, 1925, the nation&#x27;s largest fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega, was founded at Lafayette College in Easton.

==Geography==
 
Easton is located at (40.688248, −75.216458).
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (8.39%) of which is water, including Bushkill Creek and the Lehigh and Delaware rivers. It also includes an island, Getter&#x27;s Island, which was the site of Pennsylvania&#x27;s last public execution.

===Districts===
Easton is divided into four districts: Downtown (DD), College Hill (CH), South Side (SS), and West Ward (WW). A number of smaller additional parks and institutional districts also exist.

Downtown Easton lies at the confluence of the Lehigh River and Delaware River and is a low-lying area surrounded by hills to the north, west, and south.

Prior to the American Civil War, Easton was also home to Union Law School, which was founded in 1846 but struggled soon after the death of its founder, Judge Washington McCartney, a decade later, in 1856. While at least two students, future U.S. Representative Philip Johnson and Wisconsin state senator Robert L. D.

<text>Forks Township is a township in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population of Forks Township was 16,077 as of the 2020 census. It is part of the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th-most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. as of the 2020 census. The township is home to the global headquarters of Crayola, founded in 1885, a global arts supply company and the world&#x27;s leading manufacturer of crayons.

Forks Township is located northeast of Allentown, north of Philadelphia, and west of New York City.

==History==
Prior to the Walking Purchase in 1737, the Lenape, a Native American tribe, inhabited the area and many Lenape artifacts were found in the area. Forks Township was founded in 1754 north of Easton, Pennsylvania. It was founded as a farming based community in-between the Bushkill Creek and Delaware River. 

Permanent settlement by the colonists happened in the early 18th century due to its proximity to an Irish-Scottish settlement named &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Settlement&quot; in Lower Mount Bethel Township. After decades of new settlers settling in the Lehigh Valley, Northampton County was formed from Bucks County, Pennsylvania to its south. Many taverns and inns were developed due to meet the demand of passengers through the area, such as Pennsylvania Route 611 in the 19th century.

During the Industrial Revolution, many dairy industries and blacksmiths emerged in the region. Crayola was founded in 1903 as a small crayon industry in Easton, and moved its headquarters to Forks Township. 

In the mid-20th century, the decrease of agriculture led to major suburban development in the area. Since the 1990s, the area has converted to mostly a residential suburb of Easton.

==Geography==

Its six villages are Chestnut Hill, Churchville, Keplers Mill, Sandts Eddy, Uhlers Station, and Zucksville. The township was named Forks since it lies at the &quot;fork&quot; of two rivers in the region, the Delaware and Lehigh.

<text>Freemansburg is a borough in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,875 as of the 2020 census. The Lehigh River, a tributary of the Delaware River, flows through Freemansburg.

Freemansburg is part of the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th-most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. as of the 2020 census.

==History==
The area that would become Freemansburg was first settled by the Bachman family in the 1760s with their old stone house, which also doubled as a tavern, still standing on the western edge of the borough. The Bachmans resisted several attacks from local Indians who lived on the opposite bank of the Lehigh River. Shortly afterwards the Bachmans were joined by the Freemans as well as Moravians from neighboring Bethlehem who built a series of mills, as well as a distillery and tavern.

In 1811 a bridge was built across the Lehigh River at Freemansburg and the first physician moved into the area in 1817, as well as the opening of the first general store in 1825. By the 1830s the hamlet was starting to develop into a municipality within its own right, as a public school was built in 1838. Also in the 1830s the eponymous Jacob Freeman began operating a local tavern. Freemansburg would become an incorporated borough in January 1856. It originally had a Chief Burgess system of government, like many municipalities in Pennsylvania, where the executive of the government was a mostly powerless honorary position elected for one year terms from among members of the city council. The first Chief Burgess was George Bachman, and the first members of the city council were: William Gwinner the council President, Amos Seip, John Warg, Thomas Doney, and R. O. Lerch. They would be sworn in on March 29, 1856.

The town is notable for having a seven-member city council, the same size as that of Bethlehem, despite Bethlehem having a population nearly 4000% larger than Freemansburg. Additionally, this council has seen high turnover of membership and rather vitriolic debates and name calling as well as a deep-seated rivalry between true &quot;burgers&quot;, people born and raised in the borough, and those who moved in from Bethlehem after the closing of the Bethlehem Works.

==Geography==
Freemansburg is located at (40.627348, -75.339815). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and (5.26%) is water.

No numbered highways pass through Freemansburg directly. Main thoroughfares traversing the borough include Freemansburg Avenue, Washington Street, Main Street, Market Street and Cambria Street.

==Demographics==

As of 2010, the population has increased 39.0% from 2000 to 2010, which there were 2,636 people in the borough. The 2010 racial makeup of the borough has dramatically changed as well. In 2010, the borough was 59.7% (Whites), 12.7% (African Americans), 0.3% (Native Americans), 0.8% (Asians), 0.04% (Pacific Islander), and 2.0% from two or more races.

<text>Glendon is a borough in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. The population of Glendon was 373 at the 2020 census.

==History==
===Foundation===
The territory that would make up Glendon consisted of a few scattered farms prior to 1844 when the Glendon Iron Works opened. By 1856 the iron works was recognized as one of the best of Pennsylvania in terms of quality leading to the construction of 30 to 40 buildings to support the growing workforce. The company town quickly grew, and by 1867 had a population of 141, enough to warrant the community to be incorporated as a borough, resulting in even more growth, with the population jumping to 707 by 1870.

Joseph Morrison, an immigrant from Castle Toothery, Ireland was named the first Chief Burgess and by 1880 the population reached 1,000. Around this time the mining industry was starting to fade, and the residents, who mostly spent their salaries on cheap whiskey, caused the borough to develop a reputation for rowdiness.

Despite being a company town, Glendon was known for never having a strike during the gilded age, never having a union presence among its workers, and high wages among its workers that were comparable to what financial analysts on Wall Street were making at the time. Additionally, the residents of Glendon where notably more conservative than other laborers, opening a chapter of the Patriotic Order Sons of America which is still in operation. Despite the small size, the borough also maintained a police force and public school system.

==Geography==
Hellertown is located at (40.584099, -75.338139). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

==History==
===Pre-settlement===
The area of present-day Hellertown was inhabited by various American Indian groups and European settlers.

===18th century===
Hellertown was founded in 1742 by Christopher Heller and his brother Simon. The family were Palatines that left Rotterdam on September 5, 1738 and landed in Philadelphia. Christopher obtained the patent for his land September 8, 1742, and Simon received his patent October 14, 1746. Together they owned a 176 acre property at the southern foot of the Lehigh Mountain along the Saucon Creek and constructed the family plantation named &quot;delay&quot;. 

===19th century===
In 1820, the town contained thirteen houses, eighteen families, three taverns, two stores, one grist-mill, and seventy-three inhabitants. The town specialized in the production of linseed oil. The first school in Hellertown was built in 1845 following the donation of a plot of land by resident John Reutzheimer. Prior to this all schooling was performed on a rotation basis in local homes.

In the late 1840s, the town would shift from a small farming community to a burgeoning industrial center, with coal yards being built in 1848, and the Lower Saucon Ironworks opening in 1849. This growth was expedited in 1856 the North Pennsylvania Railroad was built through Hellertown and Rudolphus Kent, of Gwynedd, purchased a plot of land to build a rail station. The small wooden station would be demolished in favor of a larger stone one in 1868. In 1858, the town&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The Hellertown Telegraph&quot; began publication, but would only last a year before shutting its doors. In 1866, a large iron foundry was constructed by the Lower Saucon Ironworks. It was joined by the Saucon Savings bank in 1871, and a steel foundry in 1872. A Planing mill was built in 1874 and a furniture factory and flour mill in 1875. 

In 1870, the original school house built in 1845 was purchased and turned into an Evangelical Church, the first church in the town, prior to which all religious services where held on a rotational basis in people&#x27;s houses. Since 1867, the town has had an Odd Fellows lodge, and they were joined in October 1869 by the second ever chapter of the Sons of Hermann. 

In 1874, the first cemetery in the town was started, the Union Cemetery. In 1875, the town&#x27;s second newspaper, &quot;The Saucon Advertiser&quot; was founded, but it would close in just a few months. That year Hellertown consisted of five stores, two hardware stores, one drug store, two carriage factories, one foundry, one grist-mill, one saw-mill, one planing-mill, two furnace stacks, three hotels, coal and lumber yard, furniture manufactory, a town hall, a bank, two churches, and a population of almost 1,000.

*State Senator Lisa Boscola, Democrat, 18th district
*U.S. Representative Ryan Mackenzie, Republican, 7th district

<text>Bugsy is a 1991 American biographical crime drama film directed by Barry Levinson and written by James Toback. The film stars Warren Beatty, Annette Bening, Harvey Keitel, Ben Kingsley, Elliott Gould, Bebe Neuwirth, and Joe Mantegna. It is based on the life of American mobster Bugsy Siegel and his affair with starlet Virginia Hill.

&quot;Bugsy&quot; was given a limited release by TriStar Pictures on December 13, 1991, followed by a theatrical wide release on December 20, 1991. It received generally positive reviews from critics. It received ten nominations at the 64th Academy Awards (including for Best Picture and Best Director) and won two: Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design. It won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

==Plot==
In 1941, gangster Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel, who had partnered in crime since childhood with Meyer Lansky and Charlie Luciano, goes to Los Angeles and instantly falls in love with Virginia Hill, a tough-talking Hollywood starlet. The two meet for the first time when Bugsy visits actor George Raft on the set of &quot;Manpower&quot;. He buys a house in Beverly Hills, planning to stay there while his wife and two daughters remain in Scarsdale, New York.

Bugsy is in California to wrestle control of betting parlors away from weak Los Angeles crime family boss Jack Dragna. Ascending local Jewish gangster Mickey Cohen robs Dragna&#x27;s operation one day. He is confronted by Bugsy, who decides he should be in business with the guy who committed the robbery, not the guy who got robbed. Cohen is put in charge of the betting casinos; Dragna is forced to confess to a raging Bugsy that he stole $14,000 and is told he now answers to Cohen.

After arguments about Virginia&#x27;s trysts with drummer Gene Krupa and various bullfighters and Bugsy&#x27;s reluctance to get a divorce, Virginia makes a romantic move on Bugsy. On a trip to Nevada to make a maintenance call to a rough gambling joint, Bugsy is struck with the inspiration for a luxury hotel and casino in the desert of Nevada, which happens to be in the only state where gambling is legal. He obtains $1 million in funding from Lansky and other New York City mobsters, on the motion of going big, doing it legit in Nevada. Virginia wants no part of it until Bugsy offers her a share, puts her in charge of accounting and begins constructing the Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel Casino in Las Vegas; however, the budget soon soars out of control to $6 million due to his extravagance. Bugsy tries everything to ensure it gets completed, even selling his share of the casino.

Bugsy is visited in Los Angeles by former associate Harry Greenberg, who has betrayed his old associates to save himself and run out of money from a combination of his gambling habits and being extorted by prosecutors who want his testimony. Though he is Harry&#x27;s trusted friend, Bugsy has no choice but to kill him. He is arrested for the murder, but the only witness is a cab driver who dropped Harry off in front of Bugsy&#x27;s house. The driver is paid to leave town.

Lansky waits for Bugsy outside the jail and gives a satchel of money to his friend, though he warns Bugsy that he will no longer be able to protect him. The Flamingo&#x27;s opening night is a total failure in a rainstorm, and $2 million of the budget is unaccounted for. Bugsy discovers that Virginia stole the money, which he then lets her keep. He then urges Lansky to never sell his share of the casino because he will live to thank him someday.

Later that night, Bugsy is shot and killed in his home. Virginia is told the news in Las Vegas and knows her own days could be numbered.

The end title cards state that one week after Bugsy&#x27;s death, Virginia returned all of the missing money to Lansky and later committed suicide in Austria, and by 1991, the $6 million invested in Bugsy&#x27;s Las Vegas dream had generated revenues of $100 billion.

==Production==
Beatty&#x27;s desire to make and star in a film about Bugsy Siegel can be traced all the way back to the late 1970s and early 1980s. After completing &quot;Reds&quot;, Beatty had several projects that he wanted to do but his two dream projects were to produce, star, and possibly direct the life story of Howard Hughes and the life story of Bugsy. Beatty stated that of all the characters he played in films, such as Clyde Barrow in &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; and John Reed in &quot;Reds&quot;, he felt that he was the right actor to play both Bugsy and Hughes.

Beatty was fascinated by Siegel, who he thought was a strange emblem of America (an American gangster who was the son of Jewish immigrants who became fascinated with Hollywood and who also envisioned a desert city in which legal gambling is allowed). Several filmmakers attempted to make a film based on Bugsy&#x27;s life, most famously French director Jean-Luc Godard, who wrote a script entitled &quot;The Story&quot; and envisioned Robert De Niro as Siegel and Diane Keaton as Virginia Hill.
In the late 1970s, Beatty met screenwriter James Toback, with whom he became fast friends when Beatty was preparing &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;. Years later, when Beatty was in pre-production on &quot;Ishtar&quot;, he asked Toback to write a script on Bugsy.

During the course of six years and in between two films that he was involved in, Toback wrote a 400-page document of Bugsy&#x27;s life. However, under some strange circumstances, Toback lost the entire document. Under pressure from Warner Bros., who Beatty learned also had a Bugsy Siegel script ready to be produced, Beatty pursued Toback to write a script based on his lost document. Toback handed his new script to Beatty. Beatty approved it and went to several studios in hopes of obtaining financing and distribution for the film. Beatty presented Toback&#x27;s script to Warner Bros. and claimed that it was much better than the one that Warner Bros. was interested in producing. Warner Bros. passed on the project, and Beatty eventually got the backing of TriStar Pictures.

Initially, Toback was under the impression that &quot;he&quot; would be the director. For a while, Beatty could not find a director (he did not know or chose not to know of Toback&#x27;s desire to direct the film). Beatty feared that he would be stuck in the position of having to direct the film himself. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m in just about every scene of the picture, and I didn&#x27;t want to have to do all that other work.&quot; However, Beatty announced to Toback that Barry Levinson was on board to direct &quot;Bugsy&quot;. At first, Toback was disappointed, but he quickly learned that Levinson was the right person for the job. Despite the length of the script (which would have run three and a half to four hours), Beatty, Levinson, and Toback condensed it to a two-and-a-half to three-hour script. The trio worked very closely together during the production of the film.

During casting, Beatty wanted Annette Bening to play the role of Virginia Hill. Before &quot;Bugsy&quot;, Bening was a candidate to play Tess Trueheart in Beatty&#x27;s &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;. After seeing her audition, Beatty phoned Levinson and told him, &quot;She&#x27;s terrific. I love her. I&#x27;m going to marry her&quot;. Levinson thought Beatty was just excited at her audition and did not think that Beatty actually meant what he had said. Both Beatty and Bening stated that their relationship started after completing the film. Later that summer, Bening became pregnant with her and Beatty&#x27;s first child, which resulted in a tabloid/media frenzy at the time. The child was born January 8, 1992, and the couple married on March 12.

Originally, Beatty played Bugsy with a heavy New York City accent (which can be heard in the trailer). However, both Levinson and Toback thought that the accent was not right, so Beatty dropped the accent (which he thought was &quot;charming&quot;) and used his normal voice.

Principal photography began in January 1991, and filming wrapped in May 1991. Locations included Los Angeles, Pasadena, California, Coachella Valley, California, and the Mojave Desert.

== Release ==
&quot;Bugsy&quot; premiered at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City on December 10, 1991. It had a limited release on December 13, 1991, and was released nationwide on December 20, 1991. Director Barry Levinson would later complain about how Tri-Star Studios promoted and distributed the film, deeming that they did not invest on it as much as their other release of that month, &quot;Hook&quot;. A director&#x27;s cut was released on DVD, containing an additional 13 minutes not seen in the theatrical version.

== Reception ==

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 84% based on 64 reviews. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Stylishly scattered, &quot;Bugsy&quot; offers cinematic homage to the infamous underworld legend, chiefly through a magnetic performance from Warren Beatty in the title role.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 80 based on 27 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four of four stars, saying &quot;&quot;Bugsy&quot; moves with a lightness that belies its strength. It is a movie that vibrates with optimism and passion, with the exuberance of the con-man on his game.&quot;

<doc id="133481" wikidata="Q6693783" url="?curid=133481" title="Lower Saucon Township, Pennsylvania">
<text>Lower Saucon Township is a township in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, United States. The township&#x27;s population was 10,772 as of the 2010 census. The township is part of the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th-most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. as of the 2020 census.

Lower Saucon Township is located east of Allentown, north of Philadelphia, and west of New York City. Addresses in nearby in township are either Hellertown or Bethlehem.

==History==

===17th century===
Until the mid-17th century, Lenape Native American tribes hunted and inhabited the land of Lower Saucon Township. European traders first arrived in the area in the 17th century, and the Lenape peacefully traded with them with the exception of several periodic skirmishes. William Penn, who later founded the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania, one of the initial Thirteen Colonies, was granted land on March 4, 1681, by King Charles II to repay a debt owed to Penn&#x27;s father, a Royal Navy officer of the same name.

The land grant included what is now Lower Saucon Township. However, Penn soon realized that he needed to purchase the land from the Native Americans to maintain clear ownership. Penn advertised throughout Europe, offering parcels of land for 40 shillings, subject to a rent of one shilling per annum forever.

===18th century===
In 1737, Penn&#x27;s sons expanded their land holdings through the Walking Purchase to include most of the Lehigh Valley. Although the Lenape did not think this was a legitimate claim, they eventually moved out of the area, allowing Europeans to settle it. Sometime before 1737, Nathaniel Irish established a farm, built a grist and saw mill, and opened a land office for William Penn. He is considered the first European settler in Lower Saucon Township. Irish was the first justice of the peace in the area, and the first King&#x27;s Highway, from Philadelphia to the Lehigh Valley, built in 1737, led to his property. His son, also named Nathaniel Irish (1737-1816), built Nathaniel Irish House in Philadelphia.

Lower Saucon Township was chartered in 1743, when it was still a part of Bucks County. It was established in the rich farmland along Saucon Creek. The name Saucon comes from the native Unami language word &quot;&quot;, meaning “at the mouth of the creek.” The township also included South Bethlehem until 1865 and Hellertown until 1872. 

German immigrants, convinced by Penn&#x27;s favorable description of the New World, settled Lower Saucon Township in large numbers, beginning in the 1730s. Some of the surnames of the early German settlers were Boehm, Wagner, Appel, Riegel, Brunner, Lerch, Laubach, Oberley, Heller, Shimer, and Lutz. These early settlers were hardworking, and their farms prospered. There were numerous mills built to provide sawed wood, flour, textiles, paper, and gunpowder. Other early industry included lime kilns and the extraction of zinc and iron ore.

During the Revolutionary War, many German farmers enlisted in the Continental Army to fight the British. At a time when the Continental Army&#x27;s reserves were depleted, they offered to sell wheat and rye on credit. In 1777, soldiers of the Continental Army transporting the Liberty Bell to Allentown, passing through Lower Saucon and spending a night in Leithsville. The Marquis de Lafayette stopped at Wagner&#x27;s Tavern in Hellertown on his way to Bethlehem during the Revolutionary War.

The first church, Lower Saucon Church, was established in 1734, soon after the early settlers&#x27; arrival. It was built by a German Reformed congregation on what is present-day Easton Road. There were ten schools in the township, established by local church congregations, before the Pennsylvania state legislature developed the state&#x27;s public school system in 1834.

===19th century===
North Penn Railroad, connecting Philadelphia to Bethlehem, was completed in 1856. This line provided an impetus to building iron smelters in Bingen, Hellertown, and Iron Hill due to the township&#x27;s wealth of iron ore and limestone. The railroad brought anthracite coal to this industry, transported pig iron to markets, and provided transportation for Lower Saucon Township&#x27;s residents.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Lower Saucon Township was impacted by the late 20th century downturn and eventual closure and bankruptcy of Bethlehem Steel, which was the second-largest steel manufacturer in the world for most of the 20th century. Bethlehem Steel executives purchased farmland in Lower Saucon Townships and built large estates in the township, and the steel company became the largest employer in the Lehigh Valley region. It underwent a substantial reduction in manufacturing in 1982 and ultimately ceased manufacturing entirely in 1995, resulting in the termination of employment for many township residents.

<text>Nazareth is a borough in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, United States. The borough&#x27;s population was 6,053 at the 2020 census. Nazareth is part of the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th-most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. as of 2020.

==History==
===Etymology===
The borough is named for the Biblical town of Nazareth in Israel, where Jesus spent his youth. The names of a number of other places in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania are similarly inspired, including Bethlehem, Emmaus, Egypt, and Allentown&#x27;s Jordan Creek.

===18th and 19th centuries===
Nazareth was founded in 1740 by Moravian immigrants from Germany. The property that comprises present-day Nazareth was purchased from George Whitefield after the construction of the Whitefield House. 

Nazareth was initially an exclusive Moravian community by charter, and other faiths were not allowed to purchase property there. It was one of four leading Moravian communities in the Thirteen Colonies; Bethlehem, Emmaus, and Lititz, each in Pennsylvania, were the other three.

In 1735, a small group of Moravian missionaries began working in the newly settled community of Savannah, Georgia, where they sought to evangelize the Native American tribes and minister to the settlers. Governor James Oglethorpe, founder of Georgia, and John Wesley and Charles Wesley, founders of the Methodist Church who were deeply interested in Moravian ideals, came along on the same boat. The Brethren settled along the Savannah River in Georgia. Like the Quakers, the Brethren refused to take part in the war with the Spanish and, as a result, were evicted from Georgia in 1739.

George Whitefield, a widely known itinerant preacher who served as chaplain of Savannah, brought the group of evicted Georgia Brethren north to Philadelphia in his sloop. Whitefield had grandiose plans, including building a school for Negro children on his tract of , called the Barony of Nazareth. He invited the Brethren, who accompanied him to Philadelphia to settle at this location for the time being and hired them to build his school. 

By the end of June 1739, the first log dwelling was erected. The workers struggled, the weather proved difficult, and winter soon arrived. They quickly erected a second log house. After its completion, Whitefield returned to Pennsylvania, bristling and angered by theological disputes with certain Moravians, particularly on the issue of predestination, and he evicted the Moravian Brethren.

While evicted from the Barony, Moravian leaders in England negotiated to buy the entire Barony. When Whitefield&#x27;s business manager suddenly died, Whitefield discovered that his finances, shaky on more than one occasion, did not allow him to proceed with his Nazareth plan, and he was forced to sell the whole tract. On July 16, 1741, it officially became Moravian property.

Nazareth was originally planned as a central English-speaking church village. But in October 1742, its 18 English inhabitants departed for Philadelphia leaving Nazareth largely in the hands of Captain John, a Lenape chieftain and his followers, who refused to leave, even though they no longer owned the land. 

In December 1742, Count Zinzendorf, a Moravian benefactor, negotiated a settlement with Captain John, and his tribe moved back into the hinterland. 

In 1743, the still unfinished Whitefield House was put in readiness for 32 young married couples who were to arrive from Europe. On January 2, 1744, the couples went overland to Nazareth to settle in the nearly completed Whitefield House. Whitefield House and adjacent Gray Cottage now belong to the Moravian Historical Society.

The result was that Nazareth began to increase in population. Enough visitors were attracted to the town that the Rose Inn was built in 1752 on an additional tract to the north. Two years later, in 1754, Nazareth Hall was built in hopes that Count Zinzendorf would return from Europe and settle in Nazareth permanently, but he never returned to the Americas. 

In 1759, Nazareth Hall became the central boarding school for sons of Moravian parents. It later attained wide fame as a &quot;classical academy&quot;, which led to the founding, in 1807, of Moravian College and Theological Seminary, now located in Bethlehem. Nazareth Hall Tract was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Up until the mid-1900s, a large part of Nazareth&#x27;s population was of German origin, better known as the Pennsylvania Dutch. &quot;Dutch&quot; is a corruption of the word &quot;Deutsch&quot;, which is German for &quot;German.&quot; The Pennsylvania Dutch were spread throughout many counties of southern and central Pennsylvania. Many Pennsylvania Dutch also came from Switzerland and the Alsace region of France, in addition to the modern nation of Germany,

Nazareth&#x27;s residents&#x27; religion reflected a largely German background in evangelical churches of fairly large sizes for such a small town, divided among the Moravian, Lutheran, Reformed (now part of the United Church of Christ), and Roman Catholic worship centers of the town. The town also hosted a fairly sizable Italian and Polish population, which largely attended Holy Family Catholic Church, in the area.

During a great immigration to the eastern Pennsylvania counties of the late 1900s from New Jersey and New York, the population expanded significantly. Developers from the New Jersey area were responding to tighter controls and regulations on new construction in the state of New Jersey by moving their enterprises to Pennsylvania.

This new expansion and housing boom was enabled by the local completion of the interstate system of highways, first begun by former U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s. In the Nazareth area, this was caused by the completion of the nearby Pennsylvania Route 33, which ran north and south, thereby connecting Interstate 78, U.S. Route 22, and Interstate 80, all of which ran east–west, and the completion of the Interstate 78 southern Lehigh Valley corridor high speed interstate, which connected the Lehigh Valley to New Jersey and New York City to the east and Harrisburg and Pittsburgh to the west.

The Nazareth Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

Nazareth&#x27;s climate is similar to the rest of the Lehigh Valley with four distinct seasons, humid summers, cold winters, and very short and mild springs and falls. This climate is hot-summer humid continental (&quot;Dfa&quot;) and average monthly temperatures range from in January to in July. The hardiness zone is 6b. Nazareth&#x27;s topography can best be described as hilly, as the town itself sits atop a local outcropping underground of one of the richest veins of limestone in the U.S. Much of the farmland surrounding Nazareth is being converted into close sitting lots of suburban housing, for predominantly commuter households.

==Transportation==

As of 2016, there were of public roads in Nazareth, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the borough.

==Media==
News about the Nazareth community is reported regularly in regional newspapers &quot;The Morning Call&quot; and &quot;The Express-Times&quot; daily newspapers and local shoppers, including &quot;The Nazareth Times&quot;, &quot;The Home News&quot;, and &quot;The Key&quot;.

==Nazareth Speedway==

Nazareth was home to the Nazareth Speedway, a one-mile tri-oval automobile racing course. The track opened in 1910 and closed in 2004, and the site has remained vacant ever since. Nazareth is also home to racing champions Mario Andretti and Michael Andretti, and third-generation driver Marco Andretti.

==Industry==
===Kraemer Textiles Inc.===

Kraemer Textiles Inc., which started out as a silk hosiery maker in 1887, is based in Nazareth. Over the years, the company changed to spinning yarns out of manmade and natural fibers for clients to use in the manufacture of upholstery, clothing, and home furnishings. The company creates and markets its own brand of handicraft yarns under the Kraemer Yarns label. The company also spun the Merino wool yarn that was used in creating the end-to-end American-made sweaters produced by the Ralph Lauren Corporation for the athletes of the 2014 Winter Olympics.

===Martin Guitar===
Nazareth is the global headquarters for C.F. Martin &amp; Company, which manufactures Martin guitars. Martin guitars are handmade instruments that once were made by artisans who apprenticed for years to learn their trade. Now, Martin Guitars are made largely on an assembly line monitored and assisted by workers, computers, and lasers. Assembly lines at Martin were instituted to lower costs, improve speed of production, and compete with foreign manufacturers, without which efforts it is said that the company would have ceased to survive.

===Cement manufacturing===
In the 1960s, at least three large cement companies surrounded the Nazareth borough area, Essroc (formally Coplay Cement), Hercules Cement, and Penn-Dixie Cement Companies. The Coplay plant on the south side has undergone company ownership changes through the years (and was also known as the Nazareth Cement Company, among other names). Hundreds of union laborers of the United Gypsum, Lime and Cement Unions worked in each plant around the town from the early 1900s.

Stories of the hard pre-union days at the cement plants are replete with the description of twelve-hour days for survival wages, poor working and health conditions, and many dangerous incidents and accidents causing loss of life and or limb without medical plans or benefits to survivors. Since the 1980s, however, the automation of the plants and eventual reselling of them to foreign firms has brought about the loss of most of the high-paying union cement jobs, presenting a blow to the Lehigh Valley economy. The impact on the local economy of these lost cement jobs was intensified by the ultimate closing of neighboring Bethlehem Steel in 2003. In the case of Bethlehem Steel, it was not automation and modernization that downsized the workforce, but failure to modernize the mills, overloaded management, and a laissez-faire management attitude about foreign competition and cheap foreign steel production.

<text>North Catasauqua is a borough in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, United States. The borough was founded in 1907. The population of North Catasauqua was 2,971 at the 2020 census. The borough is part of the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th-most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. as of the 2020 census.

In August 2008, borough council officially adopted and christened North Catasauqua as &quot;small Town U.S.A.&quot;, with a campaign devised by the North Catasauqua Betterment Committee for the official recognition.

==History==
===20th century===
In 1907, citizens of West Allen Township met at the Northampton Hotel, and signed a petition declaring the formation of the North Catasauqua. The petition was submitted to the county in early June, the final decree of incorporation was made on June 11, and was officially entered into the records on June 17. Shortly after the incorporation, the first borough elections were held, with William H. Thomas becoming the first burgess, an office equivalent to a present-day mayor.

Located between the larger boroughs of Catasauqua in Lehigh County and Northampton in Northampton County, North Catasauqua quickly grew as businesses and residents came into the new borough. A police department was formed along with the Charotin Fire Department in 1909. A new combined firehouse and municipal building was built in 1911. Prior to this, firefighting equipment was housed at the Hoffman and Follweiler stables. Church services were held around the borough at various places of worship including St. Lawrence Church (built in 1857), St. Andrew&#x27;s Church (built in 1903), and Holy Trinity Church, which was built in 1903.

In 1913, North Catasauqua School District razed the four-room Allen Township schoolhouse so that a new one could be built. The new school building housed grades 1-8 and featured, what were at the time, state-of-the-art amenities. After a merger of North Catasauqua and Catasauqua school districts in 1953, the school housed elementary grades 1-6 until June 1972.

On June 14, 1947, the borough celebrated the opening of the North Catasauqua Park and Playground built on of land purchased from Northampton County. At the time, the park included a war memorial, complete with flagpole and monument (erected in 1945); playground equipment; a baseball diamond; and 95 Sycamore trees. The park and playground quickly became a popular spot for play and recreation, as well as band concerts, picnics, the borough Christmas tree, and carnivals. The Willowbrook Golf Course has played an important role in the borough&#x27;s development. The golf course was originally a private five-hole course built by Colonel James Fuller on the Willowbrook Farm Estate to entertain personal friends and executives visiting the Fuller Company in Catasauqua. In 1932, the golf course opened as a private nine-hole course leased to Dr. Calvin Miller from Mrs. Dorothy Fuller, the Colonel&#x27;s widow. The golf course was open to the public in 1934 as a way to pay for expenses. The golf course has grown over the years and has become a popular course for local residents and area golfers. Today, the golf course has been closed so more housing can be built in the borough.

In 1975, North Catasauqua borough obtained possession of the building and transferred the municipal offices to the site in 1976. In 1995, extensive renovations took place and a rededication ceremony was held in 1996. The municipal building now houses the borough police department, borough offices, council chambers, a meeting room, fire department administrative headquarters, as well as room for future expansion.

Charotin Fire Department was relocated to the municipal building site in 1980 with the building of a new combined fire station and public works garage. The North Catasauqua Public Works Department moved to its present location at the Main Street complex when the old Charotin fire station and municipal garages were sold in 1986. A public works building was built in 1983 at the Main Street complex. The new building included garages and an office, and allowed all of the public works’ equipment to be housed in one building.

===21st century===
In 2004, an additional building was erected. This new facility allows for increased storage and includes bigger garage bays, offices, a break room, and shower facilities for employees. A paved pathway leading down to the Delaware and Lehigh Canal towpath and Lehigh River was created, along with a parking lot, for future public recreation at the river. North Catasauqua borough celebrated the centennial of its incorporation with a year-long celebration in 2007.

The borough is part of the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th-most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. as of the 2020 census.

==History==
Northampton and surrounding areas of the Lehigh Valley are rich in limestone, which is commonly used in the production of cement. The Atlas Portland Cement Company, based here from 1895 to 1982, was the world&#x27;s largest cement company at one time, and one of dozens in the area. It produced some eight million barrels of cement for construction of the Panama Canal, which included most of the cement used on the canal&#x27;s construction. Atlas was bought by another company in 1980 and ceased operation here in 1982; its last smokestack here was demolished in 1993. Currently, technology and automation mean that the cement industry can manufacture a great amount of product with 150-200 workers, rather than the thousands who were required to work in these plants in the first half of the 20th century.

The Atlas Memorial Cement Museum was opened in 1997 in Northampton. It was founded by Edward Pany, who worked at the company in summers during the 1950s. His father, an immigrant from Austria, worked all his life at Atlas. Immigrant workers from Poland, Ukraine, and other eastern European nations also worked here. The museum commemorates the importance of the cement industry and Atlas Cement to the area.

==History==
Northampton was created from the villages of Siegfried, Newport, and Stemton, which unified to form Northampton in 1902.

Due to the limestone formations in the region, Northampton became a global center for the manufacturing of cement. Atlas Portland Cement Company, the largest such company in the world for much of the 20th century, operated in Northampton from 1895 to 1982. It supplied most of the cement used in the construction of the Panama Canal.

In 1909, Atlas petitioned county courts to change the alliance into a borough, reportedly because the change would make it easier for the company to send and receive mail. The Atlas Portland Cement Company plant closed in 1982. Borough residents, many of them former Atlas employees or their descendants, still identify strongly with the company and its history. For example, the Northampton Area School District mascot is the &quot;Konkrete Kid.&quot; In addition, in 1996 the Atlas Memorial Cement Museum was opened in the borough. Historical community events included the Northampton Jack Frost Parade every October before Halloween, celebrating the onset of winter. It includes marching bands and floats.

During the 1940s and 1950s, Northampton hosted the Northampton County Fair, which was held annually and spread out across the Lappawinzo Fish and Game Club property north of Northampton off Kreidersville Road. There were large numbers of vendor stands, fair rides, animals, shows, performances, 4-H Club judgings, and Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey shows. Visitors came from all over the East Coast to attend the two-week event, and hourly buses ran from downtown Northampton and nearby cities to the Fair.

==In popular culture==
Part of the opening sequence of the 1992 film &quot;School Ties&quot; was filmed in downtown Northampton due to the town&#x27;s preservation of older buildings, which fit with the 1950s setting of the film.

==Transportation==

Pennsylvania Route 329 is the only numbered highway serving Northampton. It follows 21st Street along a southwest-northeast alignment through the middle of the borough.

The Nor-Bath Trail is a multi-use rail-trail that follows the route of the former Northampton and Bath Railroad, with its western terminus in downtown Northampton. The Delaware and Lehigh (D&amp;L) Trail also runs through Northampton.

==Education==

<doc id="133488" wikidata="Q7128276" url="?curid=133488" title="Palmer Township, Pennsylvania">
<text>Palmer Township is a township in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population of Palmer Township was 22,317 at the 2020 census. It is the eight-largest municipality in the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th-most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. as of the 2020 census. 

Settled in 1740, Palmer Township is located along the Lehigh River, a tributary of the Delaware River. It is located northeast of Allentown, north of Philadelphia, and west of New York City.

Palmer Township is a part of the Greater Easton area, which includes the city of Easton, three townships (Forks, Palmer, and Williams), and three boroughs (Glendon, West Easton, and Wilson). The township is home to Easton Area High School, a large public high school.

==History==
===18th century===
The first known inhabitants of the area now known as Palmer Township were the Lenape Native Americans in the 17th century. German Moravian settlers built on land in the Palmer area in 1740. At the time, the area was part of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, which by the mid-18th century also included land now called Northampton County and Lehigh County.

Northampton County separated from Bucks County on March 11, 1752. In 1754, Forks Township, which then also consisted of what is now Palmer Township, was incorporated in 1754 with a total population of about 50 inhabitants.

On May 5, 1857, Palmer Township was formed out of the land area of Forks Township south and west of the Bushkill Creek; the original population of the township was about 1,300 people. The township was named after George Palmer, the Pennsylvania Surveyor General who surveyed the original township lines. At the time that it was incorporated, the township was about and included what are now known as the boroughs of Tatamy (which became incorporated in 1893), West Easton (incorporated in 1898), Stockertown (incorporated in 1901), and Wilson (incorporated in 1920). 

The main activity of Palmer Township during its earliest years was providing access roads from neighboring Easton to surrounding communities, including Bethlehem, Freemansburg, and Nazareth.

===19th century===
During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the township included many stone houses near water, for purposes of power and water supply, and roads, to allow for trade. Among them were the Seipsville Hotel, which was built by the settler Peter Seip in 1760 at the crossroads of roads leading from Easton, Nazareth, and Hecktown. Seip had purchased land along the west side of Old Nazareth Road; the area later became known as Seipsville in honor of Seip. The Seipsville Hotel was the first public house between Easton and Nazareth, and became a popular stagecoach stop for travelers passing through the Lehigh Valley.

In 1977, the building, now known as the Seipsville Inn, was added to the National Register of Historic Places due to the significance of its architecture and engineering.

===20th century===
The township started to experience major growth after World War I and World War II as part of a general trend of population movement from nearby cities to the suburbs. In the early 1920s, subdivision activity along inter-city trolley lines led to a building spurt in Palmer Township, which doubled the population within 10 years. As a result, the township became seen as a desirable place to live for people who worked in other areas of the Lehigh Valley.

The population grew further in the late 1940s and early 1950s due to the expansion of water lines and the development of low-income housing.

==Geography==

The airport has direct flights to Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago–O&#x27;Hare, Detroit, Philadelphia, and several cities in Florida. The region is also served by Allentown Queen City Municipal Airport, a two-runway facility located on Lehigh Street in South Allentown used predominantly by private aircraft.

=== Roads ===
As of 2021, there were of public roads in Palmer Township, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the township.

U.S. Route 22 crosses Palmer Township east-to-west and interchanges in the township just west of Wilson with Pennsylvania Route 248, which connects Easton and Nazareth. North-to-south Pennsylvania Route 33 crosses the northwestern portion of Palmer, with an interchange at Tatamy Road within the township. Other local roads of note include east-to-west Freemansburg Road, William Penn Highway, Park Avenue/Hecktown Road, Northwood Avenue, and Main Street/Nazareth Road, and north-to-south 25th Street, Bushkill Drive, Greenwood Avenue, Tatamy Road, and Van Buren Road.

===Private and public bus services===

Public transportation is provided by LANta, a bus system serving Lehigh and Northampton counties, and is served by the 106, 216, 217, and 220 Routes. The Blue Line, LANta&#x27;s Bus Rapid Transit service, serves Palmer Township at three stops: Stones Crossing, Greenwood, and 25th Street.

The Easton Intermodal Transportation Center in nearby Easton serves as a hub for LANTA buses. NJ Transit provides bus service from Center Square in Easton to Phillipsburg and Pohatcong in New Jersey along the 890 and 891 routes. Greyhound Lines provides intercity bus service to Easton, stopping at the Easton Intermodal Transportation Center. Trans-Bridge Lines provides regular bus service to New York City.

=== Rail ===
The last passenger rail service in the region, which was provided by SEPTA, ceased operating in 1979. In September 2020, Amtrak, as part of its expansion plan, proposed restoring rail service between Allentown and New York City by 2035. This largely single-track Amtrak route has been opposed by Norfolk Southern Railway, which acquired the Lehigh Line as part of its purchase of federally-founded Conrail in 1999. 

In November 2008, the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corporation (LVEDC) and both Lehigh and Northampton counties commissioned a study, exploring restoration of the &quot;Black Diamond&quot; service, which ran until 1961, which would likely entail extending New Jersey Transit&#x27;s Raritan Valley Line to nearby Easton.

==Economy==
A lack of water during the early days of Palmer Township limited the amount of farming that could be done, and industry was limited mainly to the Bushkill Creek waterways, where some form of power was available. Residents had to get water from hand dug wells because it was too difficult to find a source of water close to the surface of the ground. Other industries began to arise in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including some iron ore excavation in the Fairview Knolls area and the cement industry near the Tatamy area; also at this time, the Taylor Wharton and Treadwell Engineering were established in Palmer Township to manufacture equipment mainly for railroad use. Most famously, Binney and Smith, the predecessor of Crayola, founded their famous crayons in their Palmer Township factory along the Bushkill Creek.

Farming techniques gradually advanced in the area until by the late 1960s; almost 50 percent of the township was then farmland. The township saw new businesses in the mid 1960s, including ITT Inc. in 1964 and Acopian Corp., in 1965.

=== Media ===
The Greater Easton area&#x27;s daily newspaper is &quot;The Express-Times&quot;. &quot;The Morning Call&quot;, based in Allentown, also is read in the area. Palmer Township is part of the Philadelphia media market but also receives numerous radio and television channels from New York City and the smaller Scranton-Wilkes-Barre media market to the northwest.

Two television stations are based in the Greater Easton area: PBS affiliate WLVT Channel 39 in Bethlehem and independent station WFMZ Channel 69 in Allentown.

Five radio stations are based in the Greater Easton area: WEEX, a sports radio station broadcasting at 1230 AM, WODE-FM &quot;The Hawk&quot;, a classic rock station broadcasting at 99.9 FM, WCTO &quot;Cat Country 96&quot;, a country music station broadcasting on 96.1 FM, WJRH, a Lafayette College college radio station broadcasting at 104.9 FM, and WEST &quot;Loud Radio&quot;, a rhythmic contemporary radio station broadcasting at 99.5 FM. WDIY-FM, a National Public Radio affiliate located in Bethlehem, maintains a translator in Easton and broadcasts at 93.9 FM.

==Education==

The Easton Area School District serves public school students from Palmer Township along with those from Easton, Forks Township, Martins Creek to the north. 

The school district has seven elementary schools: Cheston, Forks, March, Palmer, Paxinosa, Shawnee, and Tracy for grades K-5, Easton Area Middle School Campus in Forks Township for grades 6–8, and Easton Area High School in Easton for grades 9–12. Total student enrollment in the school district is approximately 8,289 students in all grades as of 2020–21.

Easton Area High School is known for its long-standing athletic rivalry with Phillipsburg High School in neighboring Phillipsburg, New Jersey. The two teams play an annual football game on Thanksgiving Day that is considered one of the largest and longest-standing rivalries in American high school football. In 2006, the rivalry marked its 100th anniversary. The game, which was broadcast on ESPN, was won by Easton. In 2009, Easton was the location of the Gatorade REPLAY Game in which the 1993 teams from the Easton vs. Phillipsburg game met again following their 7–7 tie in 1993. The REPLAY Game was won by Phillipsburg, 27–12.

Easton Area High School competes in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference, which includes the 12 largest high schools in the Lehigh Valley and Poconos and is one of the nation&#x27;s most elite high school athletic conferences. Easton holds the third-most conference championships in all sports, behind only Parkland High School and Emmaus High School. Easton is also home to Notre Dame High School, a Catholic school.

==Infrastructure==
When Palmer&#x27;s major roadway system first started to develop in the 18th century, dictated largely by the trails leading from Easton to outlying communities. William Penn Highway, the first road built in Palmer in around 1755, led from Easton to Bethlehem. Freemansburg Avenue leads from Easton to Freemansburg; Old Nazareth Road leads from Easton to Nazareth; Tatamy Road leads from Easton to Tatamy; and Hecktown Road and the Newburg Pike leads from Seipsville to Hecktown and Newburg. Greenwood Avenue, which runs between Freemansburg Avenue and William Penn Highway, was opened in the 1960s. At the time, township supervisor H. Robert Daws said, &quot;The opening of this north-south artery in the center of the township benefits not only the township, but the whole area.&quot;

Portland is located at (40.920622, -75.097738). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and (8.93%) is water. This is due to the location of the borough being along the Delaware River.

==Transportation==

As of 2007, there were of public roads in Portland, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the borough.

Pennsylvania Route 611 is the only numbered highway serving Portland. It follows Delaware Drive along a north-south alignment through the heart of the borough. The Portland–Columbia Toll Bridge crosses the Delaware River in Portland, connecting the borough to U.S. Route 46, New Jersey Route 94 and Interstate 80 in New Jersey.

Portland also has a pedestrian bridge that crosses the Delaware River, connecting Portland to Columbia in New Jersey. This bridge is the last of 16 similar footbridges that formerly crossed the Delaware River and measures a total of long. Prior to the flood of 1955, it was a covered bridge.

==History==
===19th century===
Portland&#x27;s first major business was logging. It also had several taverns and hotels. Records show that the Hibblertown Hotel, which is the present-day Ackerson house on State Street, the Dill&#x27;s Tavern, which was later torn down, and the What Cheer Inn, which is present-day Duckloe Showroom at the corner of Delaware Avenue and Main Street, all prospered because of loggers.

The railroad was a vital force in the development of Portland. It changed the mode of transporting goods, and attracted many new residents. As a result of increased population, the business community expanded to serve the needs of the village. By the time of the incorporation there were three general stores, a hardware store, a drug store, four confectionery shops, two millinery shops, and jewelry store.

The population of the Portland community has remained stable during most of the past one hundred years. Since the business community exists essentially to serve the townspeople, it too has remained constant. However, it has kept pace with the changing times. The number of businesses has not varied, but the types have changed to keep pace with modern times. Virtually all the businesses are owned by people who live in Portland or nearby communities, therefore these businesspeople not only have a sense of pride in their own stores, but in the community as well.

The Delaware River provided easy transport. At first only the Indians skimmed their canoes over its surface, but by the mid-18th century, rafts were in use during spring floods. As late as 1870, the river near Portland would be full of rafts as far as the eye could see. Rafting started to wane in the 1880s because railroads had reached the lumbering country. The Portland Covered Bridge had its beginnings as early as February 5, 1816. Records indicate that Francis Myerhoff, owner of the Columbia Glass Works, received a charter from the State of New Jersey to build a bridge across the river to help in the delivery of the sand he needed for his factory in New Jersey. In January 1869, the bridge was finally completed by the Charles, Kellogg and Maurice Company of Athens, Pennsylvania, which was later renamed the Union Bridge Company. According to an Easton paper of January 19, 1869, Mrs. Sophia Sandt rode from Pennsylvania to New Jersey and back again in her sleigh &quot;amidst the applause of the people.&quot; The bridge, of the Burr Truss type, was 775 feet long, 18 feet wide, and cost about $40,000 to construct.

Portland had a newspaper, &quot;The Portland Enterprise&quot;. This weekly paper, started in 1874 by L.G. Raymond, gave the people on both sides of the river all the news. Coe Finch took over the paper in the 1880s and continued until John Wildrick became editor in 1900. The financial center of Portland and its vicinity was the Portland National Bank. It was organized on February 7, 1903, and received its charter as a federal bank on March 11, 1903. It served the Portland area continuously except for a period during 1932 when it closed its doors under the pressure of the Great Depression.

===20th and 21st centuries===
The Great Flood of August 19, 1955, was too much for the span. Early in the afternoon of that Friday, the center of the bridge gave way to the relentless pounding of the highest water ever recorded on the Delaware River, and all but the section closest to the New Jersey side floated down the river. Thus came to an end what was at the time the longest covered wooden bridge in the United States, and the last one spanning the Delaware River.

County Bridge No. 36 in Portland was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

Roseto is known in the fields of sociology and cardiology for the Roseto effect, wherein the close-knit Italian American community exhibited half the national average rate of heart disease in the mid-20th century. This finding helped to establish that stress can contribute to heart disease.

==History==
Roseto, meaning &quot;Rose garden&quot; in Italian, is named for the village of Roseto Valfortore. Neighboring communities were settled primarily by those of German, English, and Welsh descent. The first Italian immigrants from Roseto Valfortore, Italy arrived in 1882 to work in the local slate quarries. The Wind Gap and Delaware Railroad opened a line through the town in 1883. It was operated by the Central Railroad of New Jersey until 1905, after which it was merged into the Lehigh and New England Railroad, which abandoned the line in 1955. Roseto was incorporated as a borough in 1912.

Roseto and its inhabitants were the scene of a study by folklorist Carla Bianco in the early 1970s. She compared Roseto to the mountain town where its name and most of its original settlers had come from, Roseto Valfortore in the Apulia region of southern Italy. Bianco calculated that &quot;95 percent of its present 1,600 inhabitants are still descendants of Roseto Valfortore&quot;. A local doctor also noticed positive health rates in Roseto, leading to a study that identified the Roseto effect in public health.

<text>Stockertown is a borough in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. The borough&#x27;s population was 927 as of the 2010 census. It is part of the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th-most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. as of the 2010 census.

The borough contains large industries such as Hercules Cement, Polymer Products, and Praxair. The borough spans a 2-mile radius and provides services for a population of 927 residents. Stockertown is at the hub of five surrounding second-class townships, and until the Charles Chrin Interchange was built near Tatamy in 2015, provided the closest access to Pennsylvania Route 33 for many industrial parks in these townships.

Since 2006, Forks Township has been contracted to provide fire services to the borough, and the borough maintains its own police department. It is located in Pennsylvania&#x27;s 17th Congressional District, and in Pennsylvania&#x27;s 137th (State House of Representatives) and 18th (State Senate) Legislative Districts.

== History ==

Stockertown was named for the Stockers, a Swiss family who settled on the land in the late 18th century. The post village was referred to as &quot;Stockersville&quot; as of 1845, and described as a very fertile area. In late 1900, by which time the village was being called &quot;Stockertown&quot;, a group of the village&#x27;s citizens petitioned Northampton County Court to grant the community the status of a borough. That petition was granted and, early in 1901, the borough government was organized.

In 1906, a cement plant, which later became Hercules Cement, was constructed as The Nazareth Works of Atlantic Portland Cement Company. It acquired the name of Hercules Cement Company in 1916 after its holdings after Atlantic Portland Cement filed for bankruptcy. It has changed owners many times through mergers, and as of 2008 is owned by Buzzi Unicem.

Liberty Hose Fire Company #1 formed in 1922, and the borough bought their first firetruck in 1925. After World War II, Liberty Hose opted to build a memorial in honor of the war&#x27;s veterans. The building became the borough&#x27;s Memorial Hall. In the late 1990s, Liberty Hose moved from its original building on Main Street to a new facility along State Street. This building is now the home to Stockertown&#x27;s police offices and other emergency vehicles. In 2006, Liberty Hose Fire Company was disbanded.

The freeway now known as Route 33, which runs through Stockertown, began construction in 1959 from Wind Gap to Saylorsburg. Meetings were first held with residents of Stockertown in the mid 1960s, and the Stockertown portion of the highway was constructed in 1971, opening in 1972.

Stockertown is located at (40.754064, -75.264775). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and 0.99% is water.

Belts of limestone lie under a part of the borough that borders Palmer Township and the nearby borough of Tatamy. This along with Hercules Cement&#x27;s nearby quarrying makes these areas prone to sinkholes, (&quot;see Karst Topography&quot;) and led to the closure of a bridge that carried Bushkill Street, a state road, over the Bushkill Creek. This bridge remains closed as of 2018.

== Public education ==

Stockertown is served by the Nazareth Area School District. High school students attend Nazareth Area High School in Nazareth.

==Transportation==

As of 2022, there were of public roads in Stockertown, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the borough.

Pennsylvania Route 33 is the main highway serving Stockertown. It follows a northwest-southeast alignment across the southwestern portion of the borough. Pennsylvania Route 191 also traverses the borough, following a north-south route via Industrial Boulevard and Main Street.

== Rail trail ==
Stockertown is home to a packed cinder rail trail, which, once fully developed, is slated to link the Plainfield Township Trail and the Palmer Bikeway. The existing trail is about a mile long, starting at Sherman Metzgar Park, and extending to a parking area along Main Street at the North edge of the borough (Belfast Junction). A missing link of the trail, which is still in the planning stages, would be a major step towards a regional trail system by connecting Stockertown and Tatamy. Another proposed trail would extend from the Northern hub of the Stockertown Rail Trail to Jacobsburg State Park, adding connections to Bushkill Township.

<text>The Ogallala Aquifer () is a shallow water table aquifer surrounded by sand, silt, clay, and gravel located beneath the Great Plains in the United States. As one of the world&#x27;s largest aquifers, it underlies an area of approximately in portions of eight states (South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas). It was named in 1898 by geologist N. H. Darton from its type locality near the town of Ogallala, Nebraska. The aquifer is part of the High Plains Aquifer System, and resides in the Ogallala Formation, which is the principal geologic unit underlying 80% of the High Plains.

Large-scale extraction for agricultural purposes started after World War II due partially to center pivot irrigation and to the adaptation of automotive engines to power groundwater wells. Today about 27% of the irrigated land in the entire United States lies over the aquifer, which yields about 30% of the ground water used for irrigation in the United States. The aquifer is at risk of over-extraction and pollution. Since 1950, agricultural irrigation has reduced the saturated volume of the aquifer by an estimated 9%. Once depleted, the aquifer will take over 6,000 years to replenish naturally through rainfall.

The aquifer system supplies drinking water to 82% of the 2.3 million people (1990 census) who live within the boundaries of the High Plains study area.

==General characteristics==
The deposition of aquifer material dates back two to six million years, from the late Miocene to early Pliocene ages when the southern Rocky Mountains were still tectonically active. From the uplands to the west, rivers and streams cut channels in a generally west to east or southeast direction. Erosion of the Rockies provided alluvial and aeolian sediment that filled the ancient channels and eventually covered the entire area of the present-day aquifer, forming the water-bearing Ogallala Formation. In that respect, the process is similar to those currently prevailing in other modern rivers of the area, such as the Kansas River and its tributaries. The major differences are time and depth.

The depth of the Ogallala varies with the shape of then-prevailing surface, being deepest where it fills ancient valleys and channels. The Ogallala Formation consists mostly of coarse sedimentary rocks in its deeper sections, which transition upward into finer-grained material. 

The water-saturated thickness of the Ogallala Formation ranges from a few feet to more than 1,000 feet. Its deepest part is 1200 ft. (300 m) and is generally greater in the Northern Plains. The depth of the water below the surface of the land ranges from almost in parts of the north to between throughout much of the south. Present-day recharge of the aquifer with fresh water occurs at an exceedingly slow rate, suggesting that much of the water in its pore spaces is paleowater, dating back to the most recent ice age and probably earlier. An impervious geological layer between the aquifer and surface of the land, combined with an arid climate, prevents much recharge from occurring.

Groundwater within the Ogallala generally flows from west to east at an average rate of a foot per day. Hydraulic conductivity, or the ability for a fluid (water) to move through porous material, ranges from per day. Water quality within the Ogallala varies with the highest quality for drinking and irrigation in the northern region while the southern region had the poorest. Human and natural processes over the past 60 to 70 years, including irrigation density, climate, and nitrogen applications, have caused higher concentrations of contaminants including nitrates. Nitrate levels generally meet USGS water quality standards, but continue to gradually increase over time. This trend can impact the future groundwater sustainability for portions of the aquifer.

==Aquifer water balance==
An aquifer is a groundwater storage reservoir in the water cycle. While groundwater is a renewable source, reserves replenish relatively slowly. The USGS has performed several studies of the aquifer, to determine what is coming in (groundwater recharge from the surface), what is leaving (water pumped out and baseflow to streams), and what the net changes in storage are (rise, fall or no change).

The USGS estimated that total water storage was about in 2005. Withdrawals from the Ogallala Aquifer for irrigation amounted to in 2000. Since major groundwater pumping began in the late 1940s, overdraft from the High Plains Aquifer has amounted to , 85% of the volume of Lake Erie. Many farmers in the Texas High Plains, which rely particularly on groundwater, are now turning away from irrigated agriculture as pumping costs have risen and as they have become aware of the hazards of overpumping.

===Groundwater recharge===
The rate at which groundwater is recharged is limited by several factors. Much of the plains region is semiarid, with steady winds that hasten evaporation of surface water and precipitation. In many locations, the aquifer is overlain, in the vadose zone, with a shallow layer of caliche that is practically impermeable; this limits the amount of water able to recharge the aquifer from the land surface. However, the soil of the playa lakes is different and not lined with caliche, making these some of the few areas where the aquifer can recharge. The destruction of playas by farmers and development decreases the available recharge area. The prevalence of the caliche is partly due to the ready evaporation of soil moisture and the semiarid climate; the aridity increases the amount of evaporation, which in turn increases the amount of caliche in the soil. Both mechanisms reduce the amount of recharge water that reaches the water table.

Recharge in the aquifer ranges from per year in parts of Texas and New Mexico to per year in south-central Kansas.

===Groundwater discharge===

The regions overlying the Ogallala Aquifer are some of the most productive regions in the United States for ranching livestock, and growing corn, wheat, and soybeans. The success of large-scale farming in areas that do not have adequate precipitation and do not always have perennial surface water for diversion has depended heavily on pumping groundwater for irrigation.

Early settlers of the semiarid High Plains were plagued by crop failures due to cycles of drought, culminating in the disastrous Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Only after World War II, when center-pivot irrigation became available, was the land mass of the High Plains aquifer system transformed into one of the most agriculturally productive regions in the world.

===Change in groundwater storage===
Ground water levels decline when the rate of extraction by irrigation exceeds the rate of recharge. At places, the water table was measured to drop more than 5 ft (1.5 m) per year at the time of maximum extraction. In extreme cases, the deepening of wells was required to reach the steadily falling water table. In the 21st century, recognition of the significance of the aquifer has led to increased coverage from regional and international journalists.

Water conservation practices (terracing and crop rotation), more efficient irrigation methods (center pivot and drip), and reduced area under irrigation have helped to slow depletion of the aquifer, but levels are generally still dropping in areas including southwestern Kansas and the Texas Panhandle. In other areas, such as parts of eastern and central Nebraska and of the region south of Lubbock, Texas, water levels have risen since 1980.

The center-pivot irrigator was described as the &quot;villain&quot; in a 2013 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, &quot;Wells Dry, Fertile Plains Turn to Dust&quot; recounting the relentless decline of parts of the Ogallala Aquifer. Sixty years of intensive farming using huge center-pivot irrigators has emptied parts of the High Plains Aquifer. Hundreds to thousands of years of rainfall would be needed to replace the groundwater in the depleted aquifer. In Kansas in 1950, irrigated cropland covered ; with the use of center-pivot irrigation, nearly three million acres of land were irrigated. In some places in the Texas Panhandle, the water table has been drained (dewatered). &quot;Vast stretches of Texas farmland lying over the aquifer no longer support irrigation. In west-central Kansas, up to a fifth of the irrigated farmland along a of the aquifer has already gone dry.&quot;

The center-pivot irrigation system is considered to be a highly efficient system which helps conserve water. However, by 2013, as the water consumption efficiency of the center-pivot irrigator improved over the years, farmers chose to plant more intensively, irrigate more land, and grow thirstier crops rather than reduce water consumption--an example of the Jevons Paradox in practice. One approach to reducing the amount of groundwater used is to employ treated recycled water for irrigation; another approach is to change to crops that require less water, such as sunflowers.

Several rivers, such as the Platte, run below the water level of the aquifer. Because of this, the rivers receive groundwater flow (baseflow), carrying it out of the region rather than recharging the aquifer.

The $46.1-million Optima Lake dam in western Oklahoma was rendered useless when the dropping level of the aquifer drastically reduced flow of the Beaver River, the lake&#x27;s intended source of water.

===Accelerated decline in aquifer storage===
The depletion between 2001 and 2008, inclusive, is about 32% of the cumulative depletion during the entire 20th century. In the United States, the biggest users of water from aquifers include agricultural irrigation and oil and coal extraction. &quot;Cumulative total groundwater depletion in the United States accelerated in the late 1940s and continued at an almost steady linear rate through the end of the century. In addition to widely recognized environmental consequences, groundwater depletion also adversely impacts the long-term sustainability of groundwater supplies to help meet the nation’s water needs.&quot; According to Matthew Sanderson, a professor of sociology at Kansas State University, these trends are exacerbated by an agricultural subsidy system and a United States tax code that encourage overinvestment in water-using technology due to a treadmill of production. The treadmill of production is complemented by a treadmill of protection, a water conservation system whose policies delay effective long term water conservation measures to protect the water interests of its key industries in the short term. Robertson suggests federal policy reforms to increase incentives to conserve groundwater, such as amendments to the Conservation Reserve Program, along with increased restrictions on water use at the state level.

Since the 1940s, pumping from the Ogallala has drawn the aquifer down by more than in some areas. Producers have taken steps to reduce their reliance on irrigated water. Streamlined operations allow them to produce significantly greater yield using roughly the same amount of water needed four decades ago. Still, losses to the aquifer between 2001 and 2011 equated to a third of its cumulative depletion during the entire 20th century. The Ogallala is recharged primarily by rainwater, but only about one inch of precipitation actually reaches the aquifer annually. Rainfall in most of the Texas High Plains is minimal, evaporation is high, and infiltration rates are slow.

During the 1990s, the aquifer held some three billion acre-feet of groundwater used for crop irrigation as well as drinking water in urban areas. The demand for the water outstrips its replenishment. The water level is particularly on the decline in Texas and New Mexico. Continued long-term use of the aquifer is &quot;troublesome and in need of major reevaluation,&quot; according to the historian Paul H. Carlson, professor-emeritus from Texas Tech University in Lubbock.

==Environmental controversies==
===Keystone Pipeline===
In 2008, TransCanada Corporation proposed the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline to carry oil from the Athabasca oil sands of Alberta to refineries near Houston, Texas.
The proposed route of the pipeline crosses the eastern part of the Nebraska Sandhills; opponents of the route cite the risk to the Ogallala Aquifer posed by the possibility of contamination from spilled dilute bitumen.

Pipeline industry spokesmen have noted that thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, in southeast Wyoming, eastern Colorado and New Mexico, western Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. The Pioneer crude oil pipeline crosses east-west across Nebraska, and the Pony Express pipeline, which crosses the Ogallala Aquifer in Colorado, Nebraska, and Kansas, was being converted as of 2013 from natural gas to crude oil, under a permit from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

As the lead agency in the transboundary pipeline project, the U.S. State Department commissioned an environmental-impact assessment as required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The &quot;Environmental Impact Statement&quot; concluded that the project posed little threat of &quot;adverse environmental impacts&quot;, the report was drafted by Cardno Entrix, a company that assisted both the Department of State and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in preparing environmental impact statements for other proposed TransCanada projects. Although it is &quot;common for companies applying to build government projects to be involved in assigning and paying for the impact analysis&quot;, several opponents of the project suggested there could be a conflict of interest. In response to that concern, the Department of State&#x27;s Office of the Inspector General conducted an investigation of the potential conflict of interest. The February 2012 report of that investigation states no conflict of interest existed either in the selection of the contractor or in the preparation of the environmental impact statement.

U.S. President Barack Obama &quot;initially rejected the Keystone XL pipeline in January 2012, saying he wanted more time for an environmental review.&quot; On February 17, 2013, a rally at the National Mall drew an estimated 40,000 in protest of Keystone XL. In January 2014, the U.S. State Department released its Keystone pipeline &quot;Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the Keystone XL Project Executive Summary&quot;, which concluded that, according to models, a large crude oil spill from the pipeline that reached the Ogallala could spread as far as , with dissolved components spreading as much as further. 

Early in his presidency, U.S. President Donald Trump overturned U.S. President Barack Obama&#x27;s decision by signing executive memos in support of the Keystone XL pipeline in January 2017. On January 20, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to revoke the permit that was granted to TC Energy Corporation for the Keystone XL Pipeline (Phase 4). On June 9, 2021, TC Energy abandoned plans for the Keystone XL Pipeline.

==Conservation==
Since 2010, the North Plains Groundwater Conservation District, which encompasses eight counties north of Amarillo, including Moore and Dallam Counties, has offered a $300,000 annual demonstration project to conserve water that farmers pump from the Ogallala Aquifer. Participating farmers grow corn with just over half of the water that they would normally require to irrigate the fields, or they plant several weeks later than customary. Pivot sprinklers are used in the project, rather than the more expensive drip irrigation. According to district manager Steve Walthour, conservation is essential considering declining levels of the aquifer. The local non-profit organization Ogallala Commons, named for the aquifer itself, which not only collaborates and supports the local communicates, also works to conserve the Ogallala Aquifer and the surrounding area.

Eleven farmers in 2013 participated in the conservation program, with some planting in dry earth, rather than watered soil. They are leaving more space between plants, a technique that retains moisture for a longer period of time. Soil sensors permit farmers to gather accurate information about the moisture level of their crops. The motivation to save water comes from the district&#x27;s regulations on extracting water from the aquifer. The United States Geological Survey determined the water level in the aquifer has dropped more in Texas than in any other state in the basin.

Farmers on their own land may draw water from the aquifer without charge. Pumping costs are low because the fuel used, natural gas, is inexpensive. The North Plains district first established limits on pumping in 2005 and tightened the regulations four years later. Certain wells are now required to have meters. Yet another challenge facing the district is that higher prices for crops have prompted some to plant additional fields and further increase the use of water from the aquifer.

<doc id="133496" wikidata="Q45867" url="?curid=133496" title="Parallelogram">
<text>In Euclidean geometry, a parallelogram is a simple (non-self-intersecting) quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. The opposite or facing sides of a parallelogram are of equal length and the opposite angles of a parallelogram are of equal measure. The congruence of opposite sides and opposite angles is a direct consequence of the Euclidean parallel postulate and neither condition can be proven without appealing to the Euclidean parallel postulate or one of its equivalent formulations.

By comparison, a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides is a trapezoid in American English or a trapezium in British English.

The three-dimensional counterpart of a parallelogram is a parallelepiped.

The word &quot;parallelogram&quot; comes from the Greek παραλληλό-γραμμον, &quot;parallēló-grammon&quot;, which means &quot;a shape of parallel lines&quot;.

==Special cases==
*Rectangle – A parallelogram with four angles of equal size (right angles).
*Rhombus – A parallelogram with four sides of equal length. Any parallelogram that is neither a rectangle nor a rhombus was traditionally called a rhomboid but this term is not used in modern mathematics.
*Square – A parallelogram with four sides of equal length and angles of equal size (right angles).

==Characterizations==
A simple (non-self-intersecting) quadrilateral is a parallelogram if and only if any one of the following statements is true:
*Two pairs of opposite sides are parallel (by definition).
*Two pairs of opposite sides are equal in length.
*Two pairs of opposite angles are equal in measure.
*The diagonals bisect each other.
*One pair of opposite sides is parallel and equal in length.
*Adjacent angles are supplementary.
*Each diagonal divides the quadrilateral into two congruent triangles.
*The sum of the squares of the sides equals the sum of the squares of the diagonals. (This is the parallelogram law.)
*It has rotational symmetry of order 2.
*The sum of the distances from any interior point to the sides is independent of the location of the point. (This is an extension of Viviani&#x27;s theorem.)
*There is a point &quot;X&quot; in the plane of the quadrilateral with the property that every straight line through &quot;X&quot; divides the quadrilateral into two regions of equal area.
Thus, all parallelograms have all the properties listed above, and conversely, if just any one of these statements is true in a simple quadrilateral, then it is considered a parallelogram.

==Other properties==

*Opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel (by definition) and so will never intersect.
*The area of a parallelogram is twice the area of a triangle created by one of its diagonals.
*The area of a parallelogram is also equal to the magnitude of the vector cross product of two adjacent sides.
*Any line through the midpoint of a parallelogram bisects the area.
*Any non-degenerate affine transformation takes a parallelogram to another parallelogram.
*A parallelogram has rotational symmetry of order 2 (through 180°) (or order 4 if a square). If it also has exactly two lines of reflectional symmetry then it must be a rhombus or an oblong (a non-square rectangle). If it has four lines of reflectional symmetry, it is a square.
*The perimeter of a parallelogram is 2(&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;) where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are the lengths of adjacent sides.
*Unlike any other convex polygon, a parallelogram cannot be inscribed in any triangle with less than twice its area.
*The centers of four squares all constructed either internally or externally on the sides of a parallelogram are the vertices of a square.
*If two lines parallel to sides of a parallelogram are constructed concurrent to a diagonal, then the parallelograms formed on opposite sides of that diagonal are equal in area.
*The diagonals of a parallelogram divide it into four triangles of equal area.

==Area formula==
All of the area formulas for general convex quadrilaterals apply to parallelograms. Further formulas are specific to parallelograms:

A parallelogram with base &quot;b&quot; and height &quot;h&quot; can be divided into a trapezoid and a right triangle, and rearranged into a rectangle, as shown in the figure to the left. This means that the area of a parallelogram is the same as that of a rectangle with the same base and height:

:formula_1
The base × height area formula can also be derived using the figure to the right. The area &quot;K&quot; of the parallelogram to the right (the blue area) is the total area of the rectangle less the area of the two orange triangles. The area of the rectangle is

:formula_2

and the area of a single triangle is

:formula_3

Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is

:formula_4

Another area formula, for two sides &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; and angle θ, is

:formula_5

Provided that the parallelogram is not a rhombus, the area can be expressed using sides &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; and angle formula_6 at the intersection of the diagonals:

:formula_7

When the parallelogram is specified from the lengths &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; of two adjacent sides together with the length &quot;D&quot;1 of either diagonal, then the area can be found from Heron&#x27;s formula. Specifically it is

:formula_8

where formula_9 and the leading factor 2 comes from the fact that the chosen diagonal divides the parallelogram into &quot;two&quot; congruent triangles.

=== From vertex coordinates ===
Let vectors formula_10 and let formula_11 denote the matrix with elements of a and b. Then the area of the parallelogram generated by a and b is equal to formula_12.

Let vectors formula_13 and let formula_14. Then the area of the parallelogram generated by a and b is equal to formula_15.

Let points formula_16. Then the signed area of the parallelogram with vertices at &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; is equivalent to the determinant of a matrix built using &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; as rows with the last column padded using ones as follows:
:formula_17

==Proof that diagonals bisect each other==

To prove that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, we will use congruent triangles:
:formula_18 &quot;(alternate interior angles are equal in measure)&quot;
:formula_19 &quot;(alternate interior angles are equal in measure)&quot;.

(since these are angles that a transversal makes with parallel lines &quot;AB&quot; and &quot;DC&quot;).

Also, side &quot;AB&quot; is equal in length to side &quot;DC&quot;, since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length.

Therefore, triangles &quot;ABE&quot; and &quot;CDE&quot; are congruent (ASA postulate, &quot;two corresponding angles and the included side&quot;).

Therefore,
:formula_20
:formula_21

Since the diagonals &quot;AC&quot; and &quot;BD&quot; divide each other into segments of equal length, the diagonals bisect each other.

Separately, since the diagonals &quot;AC&quot; and &quot;BD&quot; bisect each other at point &quot;E&quot;, point &quot;E&quot; is the midpoint of each diagonal.

== Lattice of parallelograms==
Parallelograms can tile the plane by translation. If edges are equal, or angles are right, the symmetry of the lattice is higher. These represent the four Bravais lattices in 2 dimensions.
==Parallelograms arising from other figures==

===Automedian triangle===
An automedian triangle is one whose medians are in the same proportions as its sides (though in a different order). If &quot;ABC&quot; is an automedian triangle in which vertex &quot;A&quot; stands opposite the side &quot;a&quot;, &quot;G&quot; is the centroid (where the three medians of &quot;ABC&quot; intersect), and &quot;AL&quot; is one of the extended medians of &quot;ABC&quot; with &quot;L&quot; lying on the circumcircle of &quot;ABC&quot;, then &quot;BGCL&quot; is a parallelogram.

===Varignon parallelogram===


Varignon&#x27;s theorem holds that the midpoints of the sides of an arbitrary quadrilateral are the vertices of a parallelogram, called its &quot;Varignon parallelogram&quot;. If the quadrilateral is convex or concave (that is, not self-intersecting), then the area of the Varignon parallelogram is half the area of the quadrilateral.

Proof without words (see figure):

# An arbitrary quadrilateral and its diagonals.
# Bases of similar triangles are parallel to the blue diagonal.
# Ditto for the red diagonal.
# The base pairs form a parallelogram with half the area of the quadrilateral, &quot;Aq&quot;, as the sum of the areas of the four large triangles, &quot;Al&quot; is 2 &quot;Aq&quot; (each of the two pairs reconstructs the quadrilateral) while that of the small triangles, &quot;As&quot; is a quarter of &quot;Al&quot; (half linear dimensions yields quarter area), and the area of the parallelogram is &quot;Aq&quot; minus &quot;As&quot;.

===Tangent parallelogram of an ellipse===

For an ellipse, two diameters are said to be conjugate if and only if the tangent line to the ellipse at an endpoint of one diameter is parallel to the other diameter. Each pair of conjugate diameters of an ellipse has a corresponding tangent parallelogram, sometimes called a bounding parallelogram, formed by the tangent lines to the ellipse at the four endpoints of the conjugate diameters. All tangent parallelograms for a given ellipse have the same area.

It is possible to reconstruct an ellipse from any pair of conjugate diameters, or from any tangent parallelogram.

===Faces of a parallelepiped===

A parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure whose six faces are parallelograms.

<text>Tatamy is a borough in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, United States. The borough&#x27;s population was 1,203 as of the 2020 census. Tatamy is part of the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. as of the 2020 census.

==History==

The borough is named for Moses Tunda Tatamy, a Native American leader. Tatamy was awarded the land that would become the borough by the Penn family for his work as an interpreter, and in 1745 was the first American Indian to be baptized by David Brainerd. In 1771 the territory would be purchased by one Michael Messinger Sr. who plotted a village. In 1892 the village had become large enough to warrant incorporation as a borough, and was incorporated on June 12, 1893, by Judge H.J. Reeder.

==Geography==
Tatamy is located at . According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

==Transportation==

As of 2021, there were of public roads in Tatamy, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the borough.

Main thoroughfares through the borough include Main Street and Eighth Street. Pennsylvania Route 33 passes to the west in neighboring Palmer Township.

==Demographics==

As of the 2000 census, there were 930 people, 352 households, and 267 families residing in the borough. The population density was . There were 356 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the borough was 98.49% White, 0.22% African American, 0.32% Native American, 0.11% Asian, 0.43% from other races, and 0.43% from two or more races.

<text>West Easton is a borough in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population of West Easton was 1,257 at the 2010 U.S. census. West Easton is part of the greater Easton area and the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th-most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. as of the 2020 census.

==History==
===18th century===
West Easton traces its origin to the heirs of William Penn. In 1737, the Penns sold 500 acres of land to a James Hamilton, who in turn sold the land to Garrett Moor. In 1772, Mr. Moor sold 200 acres of the land to John Philip Odenwelder, Sr.

===19th century===
In 1834, William Penn&#x27;s son, John Penn, laid out the Village of Odenweldertown. Adjoining his acreage was land that eventually became the Village of Mutchlertown in 1872. By 1877, Mutchlertown had 35 frame homes.

West Easton was incorporated by the Court of Quarter Sessions of Northampton County, Pennsylvania on May 30, 1898. However, the Decree of Incorporation was not filed until June 6, 1898, making the June 6 date its official date of incorporation.

Its incorporation was strenuously opposed by a large number of property owners and it was a slim majority who signed in favor of it. Only after a heated debate before Judge Schuyler on June 10, 1898, did he deny the minority&#x27;s objections to incorporation, and upheld the charter granted. Odenweldertown and Mutchlertown were successfully merged and became, The Borough of West Easton. The first borough officers were elected to office on July 12, 1898.

===20th century===
By the 1920s and into the 1930s, West Easton was a hub of manufacturing activity and employment opportunities, with mills producing textiles and small businesses providing services. The population increased to its historical peak in the 1930 census. By then, West Easton had its own school, youth sports teams, a trolley connection, railroad freight and coal lines, a police department, a self-supporting volunteer fire company, and numerous community committees staffed by involved citizens.

In the decades following World War II, West Easton felt the effects of many prosperous towns dependent upon industry that was succumbing to imported goods and production lines that required fewer human workers. Industry in West Easton steadily declined, and so did the borough&#x27;s population. The Livingstone School closed in 1974. West Easton&#x27;s youth sports programs ended and civic committees could not retain enough active members. The West Easton Police Department closed in 1965 and police protection was provided by contract with a neighboring community until contracting was not offered for 2013. West Easton turned to Pennsylvania State Police for protection after failing to find another community who would offer affordable police services by contract.

===21st century===
In 2015, all incumbent council members running for reelection were defeated, including Council President Kelly Gross, daughter of then Mayor Gerald Gross. Following installation of new council members from that election, West Easton&#x27;s new leadership concentrated on improving transparency of local government, took an aggressive approach to obtaining grant awards and donations, promoted community volunteerism, reestablished discarded community activities, and investigated creating its own police department. The 2016 council appointed a new solicitor, a new borough manager, a new treasurer, and hired a new engineering firm.

In 2017, Mayor Gerald Gross, who had served the borough for 52 years, beginning as a Councilman, chose not to run for re-election. Council President Dan DePaul ran unopposed for mayor and was elected. The new council began to concentrate on previously neglected infrastructure, including roads and public sidewalks. A $124,000 storm drain project, paid for with a grant, relieved residents experiencing flooding problems on their property and sidewalks. In November, 2018, West Easton began building its first Public Works Building for the community that would be completed in multiple phases, as grants were awarded for each phase of the project. The Borough hired Mr. Robert Mahady, a retired PA State Trooper, as a consultant to navigate the red tape of creating a new police force. In May 2019, West Easton made improvements to its War Monument Park with the addition of The Gold Star Fountain and landscaping work, in an ongoing project to be funded with grants. It began installing new public sidewalks where needed, among other grant paid projects.

After 54 years without its own police force, West Easton swore in a chief of police in November 2019. There had been opposition against a police department from a few vocal residents who claimed creating a police department would cost $1 million, and bankrupt the borough. The actual cost in finding a building for the police department and making repairs to it, purchasing vehicles and equipment, and other needs in launching a part-time police department was less than $50,000, with most of it being paid for through grants and donations. The roll-out of West Easton&#x27;s part-time police department was planned for early 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it did not see a full complement of three part-time police officers until mid-2021. The budget to operate the police department annually is approximately $160,000. State Police are on-call when there are gaps in coverage by West Easton&#x27;s part-time police force.

In 2022, The Safety First Volunteer Fire Company separated from its social club due to lack of financial support from the club, and changed its name. Now renamed West Easton Volunteer Fire Company #1, it relies on significant financial support from the borough.

West Easton governs under a strong council–weak mayor system. Council introduces and votes on ordinances, resolutions, policies, and other matters. The mayor has a vote only in the event of a tie among council. The mayor may veto an ordinance, which can be subject to an override vote by council. The mayor also has oversight responsibilities for the police department.

The governing body consists of a seven-member borough council who are elected at-large by the citizens of the borough. The council president, council vice president, and president pro tempore are selected by the council members. The borough manager, borough treasurer, and other employees are hired by the council members, and provide for the day-to-day operations of the borough.

Wilson Borough is named after former U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. First formed as a township on February 10, 1913 during the first half of 1920, a number of property owners solicited the courts to change the form of government from a township to that of a borough.

According to the 1920 book, &quot;History of the Northampton County (Pennsylvania) and the Grand Valley of Lehigh&quot;, by the American Historical Association, supervised and revised by William J. Heller, the township was consummated by the courts in 1914, but the court case of &quot;Palmer School District v. Wilson School District&quot; indicates the township&#x27;s formation occurred on February 10, 1913.

There are two very early court cases soon after the creation of the new township in 1913. The first, &quot;Palmer School District v. Wilson School District&quot;, related to Wilson owing Palmer for a certain amount of indebtedness caused by the township&#x27;s creation. The second, &quot;Township of Wilson v. Easton Transit Co.&quot; in 1916, related to Wilson officials suing the transit company for performing work without first obtaining necessary permissions. The township lost this case, but in an appeal to Supreme Court of Pennsylvania on May 22, 1917, then Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Walling ruled, &quot;The assignments of error are overruled and the decree is affirmed at the cost of the appellant.&quot;

<text>Seamanship is the art, competence, and knowledge of operating a ship, boat or other craft on water. The&quot; Oxford Dictionary&quot; states that seamanship is &quot;The skill, techniques, or practice of handling a ship or boat at sea.&quot;

It involves topics and development of specialised skills, including navigation and international maritime law and regulatory knowledge; weather, meteorology and forecasting; watchkeeping; ship-handling and small boat handling; operation of deck equipment, anchors and cables; ropework and line handling; communications; sailing; engines; execution of evolutions such as towing; cargo handling equipment, dangerous cargoes and cargo storage; dealing with emergencies; survival at sea and search and rescue; and fire fighting.

The degree of knowledge needed within these areas is dependent upon the nature of the work and the type of vessel employed by a seafarer.

==History==

==Ship knowledge, ship stability and cargo operations==
Seamanship on a commercial level involves a knowledge of all the different ship types (such as bulk carriers, container ships, oil tankers, cruise ships, platform supply vessels, and others), including a basic knowledge of ship recognition, a basic understanding of nautical terms, ship structure and naval architecture and cargo operations, specific to the vessel the seafarer is working on. Some ship types will have specialist cargo equipment and tools; for example, a bulk carrier may have gantry cranes or grabs for cargo or a container ship may have container lashings. Cargoes should be properly stowed and secured to prevent shifting while at sea. Oil tankers and gas carriers can be somewhat complex due to the hazardous nature of their cargoes, and therefore a greater degree of seamanship may be necessary for some vessel types compared to others.

Seamanship involves paying close attention to the stability of the vessel at all times. This involves calculation of the vessel and the effects of its cargo at various stages of the voyage (on departure, at sea and on arrival in port) to allow for safe passage and prevent capsizing (where a vessel turns on to its side or is upside down). This includes familiarity and application of the Load Line Convention, where a vessel can only be safely loaded to its markings to ensure residual stability for the likely weather conditions. Seafarers should regularly inspect their vessel and ensure the hull is in good condition for navigation.

Seamanship skills apply to the safe use of different types of lifting gear, whether for cargo operations or for bringing on stores, supplies and provisions. These example Derricks, Union purchase arrangements, midship or aft cranes, heavy lifting gear, rigging other sheer legs etc. This should include knowledge of calculations of stresses and effects on stability.

==Navigation==

Navigation is the art and science of safely and efficiently directing the movements of a vessel from one point to another. Piloting uses water depth and visible references, while dead reckoning uses courses and distances from the last known position. More than just finding a vessel&#x27;s present location, safe navigation includes predicting future location, route planning and collision avoidance. Nautical navigation in western nations, like air navigation, is based on the nautical mile. Navigation also includes electronics such as GPS and Loran (Long Range Navigation). Celestial navigation involves taking sights by sextant on the planets, moon, stars, sun and using the data with a nautical almanac and sight reduction tables to determine positions. Accurate time information is also needed. After nautical dusk, navigation at sea referencing the horizon is no longer possible, and after nautical dawn such navigation again becomes possible. Ice navigation involves navigating and operating a ship within sea ice conditions.

Along with general navigation, seamanship involves being able to respond to weather at sea. For example, the onset of heavy or rough weather may require an alternative passage plan (or weather routeing) for the ship, as well as the use of an alternative heading to keep the vessel from rolling (Heaving to). Additionally, heavy weather precautions onboard such as lashing furniture in the accommodation or keeping crew off the deck is considered good seamanship when navigating in heavy weather.

Navigation and seamanship also involves a working knowledge of correct marine communications and the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System.

Seamanship also involves recognition of and navigation with Buoys including IALA maritime buoyage such as Lateral marks, Cardinal marks, Safe water marks, Special marks and Isolated danger marks.

==Ship-handling and pilotage==

A fundamental skill of professional seamanship is being able to manoeuvre a vessel safely with accuracy and precision both at sea and also in port and during pilotage. Unlike land based vehicles, a ship afloat is subject to the forces of the water in which it floats, as well as the resistance and effects of marine weather. A complicating factor is that the mass of a ship that has to be accounted for when stopping and starting, as the inertia of large vessels may take large distances to stop and therefore ship-handlers must be aware of basic Hydrodynamics and the charted area, including the depth of water in which their ship is navigating.

Ship-handling in coastal areas may involve arriving and departing a berth, anchorage or buoy, maneuvering in confined channels and harbours and in proximity to other ships, whilst at all times navigating safely. Seamanship also involves safe navigation in restricted waterways, for example in river and canal transits eg along the Suez canal. Crew should be able to keep the vessel from collisions, moor the vessel during canal lockgate operations and also respond to local currents and river conditions while on passage. Two other types of operations, berthing alongside another ship (usually for Ship-to-ship cargo transfer and replenishment at sea, are occasionally included in ship-handling seamanship for some vessel types. In addition to being fully conversant with the principles of ship-handling, a good shiphandler or pilot will have developed their sense of &#x27;situational awareness&#x27; to a point well beyond that of an ordinary member of a ship&#x27;s crew; their reactions will appear to be instinctive, positive and at all times safe.

A key ability for a ship-handler with good seamanship is to possess an understanding of how wind, tide and swell influence vessel movement, along with passing vessels and the shape of the nearby seabed (the interaction effect). These must also be combined with an understanding of a specific vessel&#x27;s performance, including its propulsion and stopping distance to allow safe handling. Fundamental to low-speed maneuvering of most vessel types is an understanding of the configuration and handedness of the propeller(s). An effect known as propeller walk will kick the stern of the vessel to port or starboard depending on the configuration and the type of propeller, when large variations on propeller rotation speed or changes of propeller rotation direction take place. (In single-screw vessels where the rotation of the propeller is reversed on an astern bell, a standard was established that the propeller would turn clockwise when viewed from astern. This would mean that the propeller would turn counterclockwise when going astern and the stern would walk to port. This aided in docking operations, where &quot;port side to&quot; was the preferred situation and the vessel would be brought to the dock with a small bow-in angle and backing would flatten the angle, slow or stop the vessel and walk it alongside. An exception to this is vessels which use a controllable-pitch propeller, where the pitch and not the direction of rotation was reversed to go astern. These propellers rotate counterclockwise at all times and so the &quot;walk&quot; is &quot;normal&quot;.

Other variations on propulsion include what are known as bucket rudders and Kort Nozzles where instead of a conventional rudder a pair of dish-shaped rudders, one either side of the propeller can be swivelled vertically to direct the propeller thrust through 360 degrees. Thus to put the vessel into astern mode the rudder can be rotated through 180 degrees without altering the speed and direction of the engine. Since with the conventional propeller or rudder configuration the propeller is designed to operate at maximum efficiency when going ahead, it produces far less thrust when going astern. But with the Kort Nozzle, the ahead and astern thrust is the same. Other advantages of the nozzle are the ship can be steered astern which a conventional rudder cannot, and the ship can be steered fully under control to a standstill switching between ahead and astern mode to give complete control over speed. 

===Mooring and anchoring===
Seamanship applies to general Mooring practices and anchoring (anchors are a device used to secure a vessel to the bed of a body of water to prevent the craft from drifting) and established marine procedures for anchoring (anchorwork). This also includes the use of drogues as applicable.

Anchor work includes an understanding and awareness of types of anchors, marks on anchors and cable and shackles. It includes learning established procedures for securing anchors and cable, use of windlasses, how to prepare the anchors/clearing away anchors for letting go, letting-go (dropping) the anchor, keeping an anchor watch, clearing a foul Hawse, weighing anchor and securing anchors for sea.

===Pilotage===

Most commercial vessels in excess of size limits determined by local authorities are handled in confined areas by a maritime (or marine) pilot. Marine pilots are seafarers with extensive seafaring experience and are usually qualified master mariners who have been trained as expert ship-handlers. These pilots should be conversant with all types of vessel in their local waters and possess a good knowledge of the different propulsion systems, as well as handling ships of all sizes in all weather and tidal conditions. They are also experts in the geographical areas they work. In most countries, the pilot takes over the &#x27;conduct&#x27; of the navigation from the ship master. This means that the master and crew should adhere to the pilot&#x27;s orders in respect of the safe navigation of the vessel when in a compulsory pilotage area. However, the master may &quot;with good cause&quot; resume &#x27;conduct&#x27; of the vessel&#x27;s navigation but this is not done lightly. In some countries and areas (eg the United Kingdom and the United States of America), the pilot&#x27;s role is as an advisor. However, in practice, they are likely to have the conduct of the vessel, especially on larger ships using tug boats to assist. In some places, specifically in the Panama Canal, a pilot assumes command of a vessel and is not classed as &quot;an advisor&quot;. Other instances may be crossing the sill of a drydock, or in any port in Russia (or ex-Soviet States). This distinction is important because when a pilot is in command, the master can not take any action, but is limited to advising the pilot on any circumstance that creates what he considers a dangerous situation.

==Regulatory knowledge==
A working knowledge of the relevant rules and regulations, including those of the International Maritime Organization is good seamanship as it ensures compliance with international, flag and port State requirements. For example, the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea are the principal international rules for navigation between vessels at sea. Rule 2 sets out responsibility for safe navigation by stating

 The ordinary practice of seaman is seen as equivalent wording for seamanship. Other accepted practices of seamanship relating to the COLREGs include maintaining a proper look-out (Rule 5), proceeding at a safe speed (Rule 6) and taking correct actions to avoid collision (Rule 8).

==Maintenance and dry-docking==

Seamanship involves the correct and adequate maintenance of the ship’s structure and equipment to keep the vessel seaworthy. This involves knowledge of tasks such as painting, greasing, renewing ropes, wires and other equipment items. Seamanship also involves a working knowledge of the relevant wires, ropes, chains, shackles and slings onboard. This includes mooring ropes using to keep the vessel secure in port. Seamanship on some vessel types may involves being able to maintain and use marine cranes and lifting equipment if fitted on a ship. Larger ship types usually have a crane for cargo operations and for bringing on stores, provisions and supplies for the crew.

Seamanship knowledge and experience is an integral part of Dry-docking. This includes careful planning (of all jobs, tasks and repairs), adequate preparations (eg or painting), dry-docking calculations (primarily stability and upthrust), safety within the dry-dock and checks upon departure (eg plugs returned and sealed).

Lifeboat, rescue boat and survival craft maintenance and operation is an essential part of seamanship. This involves being able to operate survival craft in emergencies, but also to be able to maintain them effectively to operate in accordance with SOLAS requirements. The STCW Convention requires that modern seafarers be familiar with emergency operations, including fire fighting. Personnel at sea are required to undertake fire fighting training at shore based training establishments. It is a statutory requirement and considered good seamanship to regularly practice (drill) these skills when at sea. Other emergency skills include the Man overboard rescue turn.

==Traditional seamanship skills==

Historic or traditional seamanship skills are less frequently used on modern commercial ships, but are usually still practiced in training colleges and used on smaller ships, fishing vessels and leisure craft. These include ropework (included tying knots, rope splicing, wire splicing, lashings and whippings), as well as rigging of a stage, rigging of a bosuns ladder, canvas work, use of chain blocks and pulleys, etc. Other traditional practices apply to life onboard, such as forms of address to the Captain and in use of marine flag, including courtesies and flag signalling. Specifically, these include items such as flag signalling terms, single and double letter meanings according to the International Code of Signals, flag maintenance, the use of ensigns and also Morse code procedure and practice.

In the days of sailing ships, an able seaman was expected to be able to &quot;hand, and reef, and steer&quot; and to &quot;know the ropes&quot;, the basic knowledge on the identity of the many ropes with different functions. This latter knowledge was essential for both safety and efficient working - those without it would be dismissed or dis-rated at the first opportunity. 

Training is more formal in the merchant navy and naval forces, but still covers the basics of &quot;traditional&quot; seamanship. Smaller vessel types may have traditional methods of seamanships unique to their vessel types, for example turtling on dinghies and small sailing boats.

Boatwork is a traditional seamanship skill. On commercial ships, this is usually limited to rescue boats and lifeboats, however yachts and other vessels such as passenger ships may have tenders and small boats for transporting people between ship/shore. boatwork includes knowledge and operation of different types of boat, launching procedures, recovery of boats (in normal and in heavy weather conditions), how to beach a boat if possible, the use of oars or sails, as well as basic sail theory, sail terminology and markings on sails.

One other aspect of traditional good seamanship is housekeeping on the vessel. This involves correct stowage of stores, supplies, crew personal effects, etc. It also involves keeping the decks, engine room and accommodation clean and free of debris or spills. This reduces the chances of fire at sea and reduces the change of injury eg due to slips, trips and falls.

==Progression in seamanship==

Officers and Masters must pass formal examinations to demonstrate their knowledge at various levels, in accordance with national laws and the STCW Convention. These examinations have a progression based on the size and complexity of the ship, including its sailing area as well as by rank. Globally, most seafarers are required to possess a basic seamanship certificate. In the U.S., the progression begins with what is known as &quot;the six pack&quot;, a license that allows fishing guides to operate with up to six passengers . In the United Kingdom, all seafarers, both deck officers and crew, must complete an Efficient Deck Hand (EDH Course) at an approved training provider under direction of the UK Merchant Navy Training Board.

The crew of a large ship will typically be organized into &quot;divisions&quot; or &quot;departments&quot;, each with its own specialty. For example, the deck department is responsible for navigation, ship handling and general maintenance, while the engineering division are responsible for propulsion and other mechanical systems. Crew start on the most basic duties and as they gain experience and expertise advance within their area. Crew who have gained proficiency become &quot;able seamen&quot;, &quot;petty officers&quot;, &quot;rated&quot;, or &quot;mates&quot; depending on the ship type and organisation. 

On smaller commercial craft, there is little or no specialisation. Deck crew perform all boat handling functions. The officers of the ship are responsible for navigation, communication, and watch supervision.

<text>Jordan Township is a township that is located in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population at the time of the 2010 Census was 794, an increase over the figure of 761 that was tabulated in 2000.

== History ==
Previously part of Jackson and Upper Mahanoy townships in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, Jordan Township was formed during the mid-nineteenth century and named in honor of Judge Alexander Jordan, who was the first publicly elected president judge of the county. In 1852, &quot;a petition was created for its erection at January sessions ... and referred to George C. Welker, John Young, and William M. Rockefeller; the report was confirmed nisi, April 5, 1852, and absolutely, August 4, 1852.

The first township officers were:

* Assessor: Daniel Williamson
* Auditors: George Schadel, Elias Schwartz, John Wiest
* Clerk: David Witmer
* Constable: D. Bohner
* Justices of the Peace: Benjamin Markel, Peter Schwartz
* Overseers of the Poor: John Bohner, John Daniel
* Supervisors: Davis Dornmeyer, John Krissinger
* Treasurer: George Trautman

The township&#x27;s first public school system was established in 1865, which operated a total of seven schools by 1891, most of which were frame structures that had been erected between 1865 and 1866.

Also by 1891, a portion of the village of Mandata had been absorbed into the township with other sections of that community split between Jackson and Lower Mahanoy townships. Jordan Township&#x27;s post office was located in the town of Jordan; its postmaster at that time, Noah Klock, had held the position since that post office was established.

That year, the major businesses in the township were the Wirt mill in Jordan, which had been erected a century earlier, and a tannery owned by J. W. Seal in the village of Jackson, which was also home to the former Bull Run Tavern that had been converted into a hotel. Jackson also was the site of roughly twelve private residences. Other communities at the time included Hebe, which functioned as a mail distribution hub and was located in the northeastern section of the township, and Urban, which was located in the northern part of the township and was home to an old hotel on Tulpehocken Road that had been built during the early 1800s and was owned, in 1891, by David Schwartz.

===Churches===
The first churches in Jordan Township were:

* Trautman&#x27;s Church of the Evangelical Association: Organized by the Rev. John Seibert in 1826, Sunday services were conducted at private family homes throughout the township until 1877 when a permanent, frame structure was erected and formerly dedicated in February of that year.
* David&#x27;s Church, Lutheran and Reformed: Erected in 1829, this was the oldest existing church in the township by 1891, and was a weather-boarded, log-frame structure. Its cornerstone laying and building dedication were both performed in 1829. Destroyed by fire in 1864, it was replaced by a new stone building that measured thirty by forty-five feet and had a marble slab above its door that was engraved with its 1864 dedication date.
* St. Paul&#x27;s Church, Lutheran and Reformed: Erected in 1855, this thirty-by-forty-foot wooden structure had a seating capacity of three hundred. It was replaced by a thirty-five-by-sixty-five-foot wooden structure in 1890, with its cornerstone laid on May 18 of that year.

<text>Mount Carmel is a borough in Northumberland County, located in the Coal Heritage Region of Central Pennsylvania&#x27;s Susquehanna River Valley, United States. The population was 5,725 at the 2020 census. It is located 88 miles (141 km) northwest of Philadelphia and 71 miles (114 km) northeast of Harrisburg, in the Coal Region. It is completely encircled by Mount Carmel Township.

==History==
Sawmill operator, Albert Bradford, gave Mount Carmel its name because of its elevation and beautiful setting in the mountains. He decided that it deserved a special name and named it after the holy mountain in Israel. Mount Carmel began as a logging town. Coal was only discovered in 1790 by Isaac Tomlinson. It took twenty-four years until the first shipment of anthracite was shipped from the borough. Mount Carmel Inn was opened in 1812 by Richard Yarnall and was strategically located on the Centre Turnpike (also known as the Reading-Sunbury Road or Old Reading Road) halfway between Pottsville and Danville. During the latter part of 1854, the Philadelphia and Sunbury Railroad was completed from Shamokin to Mt. Carmel, which led to the opening and development of a number of collieries in the region. During the same year, the Locust Mountain Coal and Iron Company commenced making extensive openings and improvements upon their valuable coal lands in the vicinity of Mt. Carmel, building coal breakers for two collieries – the Coal Ridge and Locust Mountain collieries. The township was erected in 1854, formed from part of Coal Township; by 1862 the borough was incorporated within the township.

Mount Carmel was among the first towns in the country to have its streets lit by electricity. Thomas Edison placed one of his first generators plants here in 1883. The Edison Plant in Mount Carmel was the seventh such in the world.

In the past, there were extensive anthracite mining interests here and in the vicinity. In earlier years, the borough had manufactories of miners&#x27; caps, cement blocks, cigars, shirts, stockings, etc., and large silk and planing mills, foundry and machine shops, a knitting mill, lumber yards, a packing plant, and wagon works. Currently that area supports light manufacturing in paper and plastics.

<text>Northumberland is a borough in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,911 at the 2020 census.

==History==

A brewer named Reuben Haines, a native of Philadelphia, founded the town of Northumberland in 1772, attempting to set it up as an English village. The land that became Northumberland was purchased from the Iroquois in the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768, and the village was laid out in 1772. During the American Revolution, Northumberland was evacuated during the Big Runaway in 1778, and only finally resettled in 1784.

Northumberland was the American home of 18th-century British theologian, Dissenting clergyman, natural philosopher, educator, and political theorist Joseph Priestley (1733–1804) from 1794 until his death in 1804. The Joseph Priestley House still stands on Priestley Avenue and is a National Historic Landmark on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and a museum administered by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. There is one other property in the borough on the NRHP: the Priestley-Forsyth Memorial Library, built by a great-grandson of Joseph Priestley. Much of the borough is part of the Northumberland Historic District, which is also on the NRHP.

==Geography==
Northumberland is located at (40.893935, -76.795975), approximately 60 miles northeast of Harrisburg. It sits at the confluence of the north and west branches of the Susquehanna River.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 1.6 square miles (4.1 km2), all land.

Notable things to visit in Northumberland include Pineknotter Park, the Joseph Priestly House, King Street Park, the Northumberland High School Museum, 2nd Street Playground, and Howling Hollow Dog Park. The Central Susquehanna River Boat Society is currently planning to build a river boat in Northumberland&#x27;s Pineknotter Park in order to boost tourism in the area.

<text>Shamokin (; Saponi Algonquian &quot;Schahamokink&quot;, meaning &quot;place of eels&quot;) (Lenape Indian language: Shahëmokink) is a city in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, United States. Surrounded by Coal Township at the western edge of the Anthracite Coal Region in central Pennsylvania&#x27;s Susquehanna River Valley, the city was named after a Saponi Indian village, Schahamokink. At the 2020 United States census, the population was 6,942.

==History==
The first humans to settle Shamokin were probably Shawnee migrants. 

===18th century===
A large population of Lenape Indians (also known as Delaware Indians) resettled there in the early 18th century after the Walking Purchase along the eastern border of the colonial Province of Pennsylvania in the upper northern reaches of the Delaware River in 1737. Canasatego of the Six Nations, enforcing the Walking Purchase on behalf of Deputy Governor of Pennsylvania George Thomas, ordered the Lenape to two places on the Susquehanna River.

===19th century===

Shamokin was founded in 1835 by the coal speculators John C. Boyd and Ziba Bird; it was known as Boyd&#x27;s Stone-coal Quarry, Boydtown, and New Town. The discovery in the region of anthracite coal resources, or hard coal, became the basis of much industry. Railroad companies such as Reading Railroad bought interests in coal and became major employers in the area, building railroads to ship coal to markets and controlling most jobs. Workers gradually organized into unions to develop means of bargaining with these powerful companies. During the nationwide Great Railroad Strike of July 1877, workers in the 1877 Shamokin uprising marched and demonstrated.

Shamokin was incorporated earlier as a borough under the Commonwealth constitution on November 9, 1864, and as a city on February 21, 1949. In addition to anthracite coal-mining, it became an industrial center in the 19th century, with silk and knitting mills, stocking and shirt factories, wagon shops, ironworks, and brickyards. The dominant Eagle Silk Mill became the largest textile manufacturing building under one roof in the United States.

Inventor, scientist and entrepreneur Thomas A. Edison, briefly a resident of nearby Sunbury, established the Edison Illuminating Company of Shamokin in 1882. When the Shamokin power generating station on Independence Street started on September 22, 1883, St. Edward&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, which was connected, became the world&#x27;s first church lit by electricity. Until 2017, Jones Hardware Company was at the Independence Street site of the former Edison electrical station.

In the 1877 Shamokin uprising, railroad workers and miners angered by unexpected cuts in wages begun by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) joined what developed across the East into the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, which began with strikes in neighboring Martinsburg, West Virginia, then others in Maryland, including the headquarters of the B&amp;O at its Camden Street Station in Downtown Baltimore. It then spread north and west into Pennsylvania and to Pittsburgh and other sites in several major industrial cities in Pennsylvania, as well as more cities in the Northeast and as far west as St. Louis and Missouri. Mayor William Douty commissioned a citizen-manned militia to help during the unrest. They shot into a group of strikers, wounding 12 and killing two bystanders who were not involved in the protest. Five strikers were convicted of rioting and jailed for up to eight months for their part in the actions.

===20th-21st century===
In 1905, resident William A. Conway wrote &quot;Murder at Hickory Ridge&quot;, a dime novel, hoping to cash in on their popularity. It was a fictionalized account of an unsolved murder in the Shamokin area. His two brothers, Alphonsus E. and John J., printed the book on a press in their garage. They continued their business, starting the Conway Print Shop. With the profits from the novel, the Conways started the Black Diamond Publishing Company in 1905 and founded &quot;Black Diamond Magazine&quot; to disseminate news of the anthracite coal region. They developed a way to print a roll of tickets, planning to market them to the movie theaters being built in the area. To meet a request by the nearby Hazleton Baseball Club, they partnered with merchant Nicholas R. Ludes to make a big purchase of colored paper.

Together the Conway brothers and Ludes founded what became the National Ticket Company in Shamokin in 1907. At one time it was the nation&#x27;s largest ticket manufacturing company. Its first production facility was built in 1911 at the corner of Pearl and Webster Streets. A 1942 fire gutted the plant, although the brick shell still stands. The replacement building at Pearl Street and Ticket Avenue was completed in 1950 and has since served as company headquarters. The business is still owned by descendants of the Conway and Ludes families. In the 21st century National Ticket has developed international customers.

Edgewood Park, also known as Indian Park, operated in Shamokin as an increasingly popular amusement park from 1905 through the late 1950s, featuring a roller coaster and other rides and entertainments, and attracting regional crowds. Its included a large pond. Faced with different needs in the 1950s, the Shamokin area school district developed this property for new elementary and high schools.

The Victoria Theatre in town was listed on the National Register of Historic Places maintained by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1985. It was demolished in 1999 and delisted in 2004.
