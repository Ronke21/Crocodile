<text>Williamson is a town on the south shore of Lake Ontario in the northwest part of Wayne County, New York, United States. The population was 6,984 at the time of the 2010 census. The town is named after Charles Williamson, a land agent of the Pulteney Estate. Its primary ZIP code is 14589, and telephone exchanges 589 and 904 in area code 315.

The town has a hamlet (and census-designated place), also called Williamson. Government offices for the town are located there.

==History==

The area around Pultneyville — a hamlet on the town&#x27;s Lake Ontario shore – was a frequent meeting ground for Iroquois people. In 1788, the area became part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase, a tract of land sold to Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

The first white settler, Daniel Russell, built a log cabin in Pultneyville in 1794. This hamlet briefly enjoyed prominence as one of the few ports in the area until the opening of the Erie Canal in the southern part of the county in 1823. It did continue to be an important Great Lakes port, however, well into the 19th century.

Williamson was created in 1802 from the Town of Sodus and originally was much larger than its present-day borders. Later, other towns were created from parts of Williamson, including: Ontario in 1807 and Marion in 1825. Until relatively recently, Williamson was a dry town.

In 1814, during the War of 1812, British troops landed in Pultneyville, and an agreement was made with the villagers allowing the invaders to seize some stores without resistance, but a dispute broke out and weapons fire began on both sides. A few citizens were killed or wounded and two were taken prisoner as the British fled.

In 2002, Williamson celebrated the bicentennial of its founding with celebrations and festivals throughout the year.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (0.06%) is water.

Williamson encompasses the hamlets of Williamson, Pultneyville and East Williamson. The nearest metropolitan area is the city of Rochester, which lies to the west. The town of Williamson does not have an incorporated village.

In 1980, the northern terminus of New York State Route 21 (NY 21) was moved southward from the intersection with Lake Road in Pultneyville to its present location at the intersection with NY 104, in Williamson, about north of the town&#x27;s business district.

NY 104 is an important east–west highway in western New York, and NY 21 is a north–south highway used by many to access the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90).

===Adjacent towns and areas===
The town is bordered on the north by Lake Ontario, on the east by the Town of Sodus, on the south by the Town of Marion and on the west by the Town of Ontario.

==Landmarks and events==
A number of local points of interest are considered popular landmarks by residents and visitors alike. Orbaker&#x27;s Drive-In, a hamburger/hotdog stand on NY 104, has been in operation since 1932. With its red and white color theme, summer employment there is considered a rite of passage for the town&#x27;s teenagers. Another noted eatery is the Candy Kitchen, located on West Main Street in the business district. Opened in 1890 and known as &quot;Nick&#x27;s&quot;, it has been owned and operated by four generations of the Boosalis family. Its chocolate candies, Greek dishes and fountain drinks are popular among its patrons.

Williamson has played host to the annual Williamson Apple Blossom Festival since 1960. Celebrating the town&#x27;s (and region&#x27;s) heritage of apple farming, this event is held in May at the height of the blooms. The week-long celebration begins with the selection of the local festival queen and her court and culminates with a carnival, popular 5k race, parade and &quot;fly-in&quot; breakfast at the local airport.

==Government services==
Williamson is governed by a Town Supervisor and a four-person Town Board. Anthony Verno is currently the Town Supervisor and also serves on the Wayne County Board of Supervisors. The Williamson Central School District provides the public education services to the town&#x27;s residents through its Elementary School, Middle School and High School. The School District was designed and built by Dr. K. Slater.

==Economy==

Williamson is primarily a rural agricultural town, but since the 1960s, the growth of Rochester-area companies such as Xerox and Eastman Kodak, have added bedroom community aspects to the town. Recognized nationally for its fruit-growing – especially apple tarts, peach pies, and cherry cokes – local agriculture also includes dairy farming. It is also home of a Mott&#x27;s plant, employing roughly 300 people, which made national headlines when the unionized employees went on strike for roughly four months in 2010.

==Prohibition never ended==
On January 16, 1920, Williamson became &quot;dry&quot; along with the rest of the United States when the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States took effect. Unlike the rest of the country, however, Prohibition was not completely repealed in Williamson in 1933; this didn&#x27;t occur until more than six decades later, in 1996. While consumption of alcoholic beverages in private homes was permitted in Williamson after the Twenty-first Amendment ended Prohibition, the sales of such beverages were illegal within the town.

In 1996 residents of the town voted to liberalize the laws and the sales of wine coolers and beer were permitted in the town&#x27;s grocery stores. Prior to this change, town residents purchased these beverages in neighboring towns, such as Sodus and Ontario. It wasn&#x27;t until after the turn of the century, in 2004, that voters again loosened the regulations and allowed alcohol service in restaurants, as well as permitting winery licenses for farms and the opening of liquor stores. Bars and taverns were banned until 2004. Today, the town only bans beer sales at race tracks, outdoor athletic fields and sports stadia where admission is charged.

<doc id="127543" wikidata="Q3458180" url="?curid=127543" title="Ardsley, New York">
<text>Ardsley is a village in Westchester County, New York, United States. It is part of the town of Greenburgh. The village&#x27;s population was 5,079 at the 2020 census. The mayor of Ardsley is Nancy Kaboolian.

The Ardsley post office serves the entire village of Ardsley, plus some nearby unincorporated sections of Greenburgh. The Ardsley Union Free School District includes the entire village of Ardsley plus parts of the village of Dobbs Ferry and unincorporated parts of Greenburgh. Ardsley has a library that is a member of the Westchester Library System.

Ardsley should not be confused with the nearby hamlet of Ardsley-on-Hudson, which is part of the village of Irvington.

== History ==

Prior to European settlement Ardsley and its surrounding area was inhabited by the Wickquasgeck tribe, a band of the Wappinger, related to the Lenape (Delaware) tribes which dominated lower New York state and New Jersey.

After the Dutch came to the area, the land was part of the Bisightick tract of the van der Donck grant purchased by Frederick Philipse in 1682, first lord of Philipsburg Manor. In 1785 the state of New York confiscated the land from his Loyalist grandson, Frederick Philipse III, after he sided with the British in the American Revolution, and sold it to local farmers who had been tenants of the Phillipse family.

The village of Ashford was formed from some of these portions, named for the main road. Notable businesses included a blacksmith, and a sawmill and grist mill both situated upon the Saw Mill River. Three pickle factories were in operation by the Civil War, and in the 1880s the construction of the Putnam Railroad and New Croton Aqueduct led to a population boom which saw the installation of electric lighting and improved roads.

Due to the presence of an earlier Ashford Post Office in New York state, the town was forced to change its name in order to receive its own. The choice of &quot;Ardsley&quot; is attributed to Cyrus West Field, who owned of land lying between Broadway (Dobbs Ferry) and Sprain Brook (Greenburgh) named Ardsley Park. He had named his home Ardsley Park after the English birthplace of his immigrant ancestor, Zechariah Field (East Ardsley, West Riding of Yorkshire, England), who immigrated to the U.S. in 1629. The story told at one time is that Field agreed to use his influence to get the post office established, and in return the village would be renamed Ardsley. The first village postmaster was appointed in 1883.

Ardsley was incorporated as a town in 1896. Ardsley High School was established in 1912, with an addition in 1925. The town would continue to grow at a steady pace until a fire destroyed the village center in 1914. This led to the reconstruction of several buildings, and the establishment of a fire department in the former schoolhouse. Two population booms would follow, the first between the end of World War I and the beginning of the Great Depression, and the second following World War II. The Concord Road elementary school was built in 1953 with an addition in 1966. The town outgrew its original high school by the mid-1950s, resulting in the current facility being opened in 1957, and graduating its first class in 1958. The old school was converted into a middle school, until in 1971 the $5.5 million middle school was built.

The village was greatly changed during its second boom by the construction of the New York State Thruway in the late 1950s, which resulted in both the loss of the Ardsley station on the Putnam Division of the New York Central Railroad and the loss of much of the downtown business district.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

The Saw Mill River and Sprain Brook are two waterways that run through Ardsley. Over the years recurrent flooding along the Saw Mill River has caused damage to residential structures, commercial businesses, and industries as well as municipal infrastructure in Ardsley and other towns along the river. Recent severe floods occurred in March and April 1980, April 1984, and September 1999. The Army Corps of Engineers has completed several construction projects to help minimize potential damage from future floods in downtown Ardsley and surrounding areas.
===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Ardsley has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

It receives approximately 28 inches of snow per year.

Per the U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s 2018 estimates 4,534 people lived in the village. There were 1,688 housing units and the racial makeup of the village was 68.3% non-Hispanic white, 3.4% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian or Alaska Native, 15.5% Asian, and 4.3% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race made up 8.2% of the population.

==Education==
The Ardsley Union Free School District operates the village&#x27;s public schools. Ardsley High School is the district&#x27;s senior high school.

Lyceum Kennedy International School maintains its Ardsley campus, serving elementary grades.

==Culture==
In 2018 Brooke Lea Foster of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that it was one of several &quot;Rivertowns&quot; in New York State, even though physically Ardsley is not adjacent to a river; she described these &quot;Rivertowns&quot; as among the &quot;least suburban of suburbs, each one celebrated by buyers there for its culture and hip factor, as much as the housing stock and sophisticated post-city life.&quot; Of those, Foster stated that Ardsley was &quot;the most landlocked&quot;.

==Infrastructure==
=== Public transit ===
The Bee-Line Bus System serves Ardsley with several lines. Lines running north–south along Route 9A and 100B like 1C, 5, and 6 provide connections with Elmsford, White Plains, and Getty Square, Yonkers. Lines running east–west like 66 provide connections to commuter rail stations and the downtowns of Dobbs Ferry, Scarsdale, Larchmont, and New Rochelle.

With the demise of the New York and Putnam Railroad in favor of the construction of Interstate 87, commuter rail service to New York City is available via the Dobbs Ferry train station and Ardsley-on-Hudson train station, served by Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, and the Hartsdale train station and Scarsdale train station served by Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line.

=== Pathways ===
There is also the motor-free South County Trail connecting Ardsley to the Empire State Trail across New York State. The trail is frequently used by bicyclists and pedestrians whether they just want to take a stroll or if they want to get to places, such as Elmsford or Yonkers. The trail runs along the path where the New York and Putnam Railroad once stood.

An Armonk tradition is Frosty Day. A parade goes down Main Street onto Bedford Road, past the &quot;Village Square&quot; mentioned in the song &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; to Wampus Brook Park for a gala holiday lighting ceremony. Steve Nelson, the song&#x27;s lyricist, was a frequent visitor to Armonk after World War II from his home in nearby White Plains. In 1950, he wrote the song&#x27;s lyrics which he put to Walter E. Rollins&#x27; music; it was the same year that he was looking for land in Armonk on which to build his new home.

== Housing boom and construction ==

Armonk experienced a surge in new housing construction and development beginning in the late 1990s. New condominiums, town houses, and larger single-family homes were constructed primarily north of the Armonk business district and just to the west. Armonk&#x27;s Thomas Wright Estates or Sands Mill Estates, consisting primarily of large homes, were constructed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Armonk real estate prices have increased substantially since the late 1990s, having peaked in the mid-2000s, and never returning to their pre-2000s rates despite the subprime mortgage crisis. The new construction projects and increased housing costs have increasingly made the community unaffordable. In a construction project, a real estate company purchased the long-standing Schultz&#x27;s Cider Mill just south of Main Street and had it razed. The company then constructed a premium gated community of 27 townhouses and homes (named &quot;Cider Mill&quot;) in its place. As a result, the population of Armonk increased significantly but caused the public schools to become overcrowded and push forth a series of expensive school expansion projects that significantly raised property taxes.

Much of the new construction was pinned on the connections that former Town Supervisor John Lombardi had with the areas&#x27; construction and development companies. In 2005, after over 40 years in office, Lombardi was ousted in the election by political newcomer Reese Berman. A former librarian at the town&#x27;s middle school, Berman&#x27;s campaign promise was to put a moratorium on new residential construction to be enacted during her term in office. As of Berman&#x27;s election, no new purely residential projects have broken ground in Armonk. A new community; Cider Mill was added in 2007–2008.

=== Businesses ===
Armonk Square is a 3.5-acre development of shops, banking center, offices, one-bedroom apartments and food market.

<doc id="127545" wikidata="Q3452629" url="?curid=127545" title="Briarcliff Manor, New York">
<text>Briarcliff Manor () is a suburban village in Westchester County, New York, north of New York City. It is on of land on the east bank of the Hudson River, geographically shared by the towns of Mount Pleasant and Ossining. Briarcliff Manor includes the communities of Scarborough and Chilmark, and is served by the Scarborough station of the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line. A section of the village, including buildings and homes covering , is part of the Scarborough Historic District and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The village motto is &quot;A village between two rivers&quot;, reflecting Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s location between the Hudson and Pocantico Rivers. Although the Pocantico is the primary boundary between Mount Pleasant and Ossining, since its incorporation the village has spread into Mount Pleasant.

In the precolonial era, the village&#x27;s area was inhabited by a band of the Wappinger tribes of Native Americans. In the early 19th century, the area was known as Whitson&#x27;s Corners. Walter William Law moved to the area and purchased lands during the 1890s. Law developed the village, establishing schools, churches, parks, and the Briarcliff Lodge. Briarcliff Manor was incorporated as a village in 1902, and celebrated its centennial on November 21, 2002. The village has grown from 331 people when established to 7,867 in the 2010 census.

Briarcliff Manor was historically known for its wealthy estate-owning families, including the Vanderbilts, Astors, and Rockefellers. It still remains primarily residential and its population is still considered affluent by U.S. standards. It has about of recreational facilities and parks, all accessible to the public. The village has seven Christian churches for various denominations and two synagogues. The oldest church is Saint Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Church, built in 1851. Briarcliff Manor has an elected local government, with departments including police, fire, recreation, and public works. It has a low crime rate: a 2012 study found it had the second-lowest in the state. In the New York State Legislature it is split between the New York State Assembly&#x27;s 95th and 92nd districts, and the New York Senate&#x27;s 38th and 40th districts. In Congress the village is in New York&#x27;s 17th District.

== History ==
=== Names ===

Part of modern-day Briarcliff Manor was once known as Whitson&#x27;s Corners for brothers John H., Richard, and Reuben Whitson, who owned adjoining farms in the area totaling . Whitson&#x27;s Corners was named after the corner of Pleasantville and South State roads, where John H. Whitson&#x27;s house, the Crossways, stood from 1820 until the 1940s. The Briarcliff Congregational Church&#x27;s parish house currently stands at its former location. The neighboring community of Scarborough was known as Weskora until it was renamed in 1864, after resident William Kemey&#x27;s ancestral hometown in Yorkshire. After the community was incorporated into Briarcliff Manor in 1906, the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad put up a sign reading &quot;Briarcliff West&quot; at the village&#x27;s Scarborough station. Soon afterward, attributed to the neighborhood&#x27;s pride over their name, that sign was thrown into the Hudson River and replaced with the original Scarborough sign.

Briarcliff Manor derives from &quot;Brier Cliff&quot;, a compound of the English words &quot;brier&quot; and &quot;cliff&quot;. The name originated in Ireland as that of the family home of John David Ogilby, a professor of ecclesiastical history at the General Theological Seminary. Ogilby had named his New York summer home &quot;Brier Cliff&quot; after his family home in Ireland. In 1890, Walter Law bought James Stillman&#x27;s Briarcliff Farm and further developed it, later using the name &quot;Briarcliff&quot; for all his property. Law&#x27;s friend, Andrew Carnegie, called him &quot;The Laird of Briarcliff Manor&quot;; since the title appealed to all concerned, the village was named &quot;Briarcliff Manor&quot;. By 1897, the village post office and railroad station bore the name Briarcliff Manor. The village (and its name) were approved by its residents in a September 12, 1902 referendum; the name prevailed over other suggestions, including &quot;Sing Sing East&quot;. On November 21, 1902, the village of Briarcliff Manor was established.

The village is also known by several other names. It is conversationally called &quot;Briarcliff&quot;, and often erroneously written as &quot;Briar Cliff Manor&quot; (although historically there has been little distinction). The village has been called &quot;Briarcliff on the Hudson&quot; by Mark Twain and Aileen Riggin; it is also known as &quot;the Village of Briarcliff Manor&quot;. The name Briarcliff has also been applied to other municipalities, including the 470-person town of Briarcliffe Acres in South Carolina; in naming it, the town&#x27;s founder had drawn inspiration from Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s name. One of the village&#x27;s mottos, &quot;A village between two rivers&quot;, can also refer to the municipality; another official motto is a Walter Law quote, &quot;Only the best is good enough&quot;.

=== Precolonial and colonial eras ===

The history of Briarcliff Manor can be traced back to the founding of a settlement between the Hudson and Pocantico Rivers in the 19th century. The area now known as Briarcliff Manor had seen human occupation since at least the Archaic period, but significant growth in the settlements that are now incorporated into the village did not occur until the Industrial Revolution.

In the precolonial era, the area of present-day Briarcliff Manor was inhabited by a band of the Wappinger tribes of Native Americans, known as &quot;Sint Sincks&quot; (or &quot;Sing Sings&quot;). They owned territory as far north as the Croton River. In the 1680s, Frederick Philipse purchased about from the Sint Sincks, and named it Philipsburg Manor. The Philipses lost their claim to the land because of the American Revolutionary War; the family, which was Loyalist, had its property confiscated in 1779. The area remained largely unsettled by colonists until after the war; in 1693, fewer than twenty families lived in the area of Westchester which included Briarcliff Manor.

=== Progressive era to present day ===

After retiring as vice president of W. &amp; J. Sloane, Walter Law moved with his family to the present Briarcliff Manor. He bought his first in 1890, and then quickly expanded his property, buying about forty parcels in less than ten years; by 1900, he owned more than of Westchester County. Law developed the village, establishing schools, churches, parks, and the Briarcliff Lodge. His employees at Briarcliff Farms moved into the village, and the population grew enough to encourage Law to establish the area as a village. A proposition was presented to the supervisors of Mount Pleasant and Ossining on October 8, 1902, that the area of with a population of 331 be incorporated as the Village of Briarcliff Manor, and the village was incorporated on November 21.

The Tudor Revival-style Briarcliff Lodge was opened in 1902 as a premier resort hotel. It was surrounded by Walter Law&#x27;s dairy barns and greenhouses, and hosted numerous distinguished guests, including Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. The lodge held the Edgewood Park School (1936–1954) and The King&#x27;s College (1955–1994) before it burned to the ground on September 20, 2003.

The Briarcliff Manor Fire Department was founded on February 10, 1903, from Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s first fire company, the 1901 Briarcliff Steamer Company No. 1. Scarborough was incorporated into Briarcliff Manor in 1906, and the Police Department was organized two years later. The Village Municipal Building was built in 1913 and was opened on July 4, 1914. The high school opened in 1928, and in 1946, the People&#x27;s Caucus party, an organization which calls out interested residents for candidacy, was created. Briarcliff Manor celebrated its semicentennial celebration from October 10–12, 1952, publishing a book about the village and its history; that year, the Crossroads neighborhood of 84 houses was completed.

In 1953, Todd Elementary School opened to free space at the Law Park grade school. The Putnam Division of the New York Central Railroad was discontinued in 1958, and the following year the Briarcliff Manor Public Library opened in the former Briarcliff Manor train station. The village&#x27;s first corporate facility (part of Philips Research) opened in 1960. In 1964 the new Village Hall opened, replacing the Municipal Building. The present high school opened in 1971 to ease the large enrollment at the grade-school building. In 1980, Pace University began leasing the middle-school building, and the middle school was moved to a portion of the new high-school building. The grade-school building was demolished in 1996, and a retirement home was built on its site the following year. The village celebrated its centennial in 2002, which involved celebratory events. A two-story addition to the village library was built in 2009, and the original portion was renovated to become the village&#x27;s community center in 2016.

== Geography ==

Briarcliff Manor is around north of Manhattan. It is part of Westchester County and so part of the New York metropolitan area and the New York–Jersey City–White Plains, NY–NJ Metropolitan Division. It is on the Hudson River, just north of the Tappan Zee Bridge and south of Croton Point (near the widest part of the river) and just northwest of the county&#x27;s center. According to the 2010 United States Census Briarcliff Manor covers an area of , of which is land and is water.

The village is a part of the Pocantico and Saw Mill River Basin and the Lower Hudson River Drainage Basin, which leads to the Hudson west-southwest of the village. Major streams running through Briarcliff Manor include the centrally-located Caney Brook, the Pocantico River, and Sparta Brook. Abundant rock outcroppings include dolomite, granite, gneiss, and mica schist. Copper and silver were once mined near Scarborough, and Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s geographical area has large boulders, deposited in the last glacial period. Elevations within the village range from less than above mean sea level near the Hudson River to approximately above mean sea level around the center and eastern areas. The highest natural point in Briarcliff Manor is southwest of NGS station mark LX4016, off Farm Road, at above sea level. The village, which covered when incorporated in 1902, has expanded primarily through annexation: of Scarborough in 1906 and acreage from the town of Mount Pleasant in 1927. It is in telephone area code 914 and the postal ZIP code area 10510. Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s Ossining portion takes up nearly half of the village land area, about 93 percent of its population, and 85 percent of its land parcels.

=== Climate ===

The village is in a humid continental climate zone (Köppen climate classification: Dfa), with cold, snowy winters and hot, humid summers and four distinct seasons. The United States Department of Agriculture places Briarcliff Manor in plant hardiness zone 7a. Summer high temperatures average in the lower 80s Fahrenheit (upper 20s Celsius), with lows averaging in the lower 60s F (upper 10s C). Its highest recorded temperature was in 1995, and its lowest was in 1979.


=== Neighborhoods ===
The village is home to neighborhoods and business and residential areas, including the central business district, the hamlets of Scarborough and Chilmark, and residential areas Central Briarcliff West, the Tree Streets and the Crossroads.

==== Scarborough ====

Scarborough, often called Scarborough-on-Hudson because it borders the Hudson River, is an unincorporated district divided between Briarcliff Manor and the village of Ossining, with most of the area within Briarcliff Manor and a few streets in the village of Ossining. Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s portion of Scarborough was annexed into the village in 1906. The boundary between Scarborough and the rest of the village is roughly along Old Briarcliff and Sleepy Hollow Roads. The area was settled prior to the Revolutionary War. Around that time, the area included a tavern and inn at corner of Albany Post Road and Scarborough Station Road and a blacksmith shop where the Scarborough Presbyterian Church stands today. Scarborough was named after early settler William Kemey&#x27;s town in England. A cove in Scarborough is named after him.

Scarborough is largely residential, and has some of the most expensive houses in the village, due in part to its proximity to the Hudson. Condominium complexes within Scarborough include Kemeys Cove, built in 1974, and Scarborough Manor, a 7-story, 205-unit complex built in the 1960s. The hamlet has a post office and a station on the Metro-North Hudson Line within walking distance of most houses in the hamlet. Unlike most of Briarcliff Manor, Scarborough is within the Ossining Union Free School District. During the 17th century, Scarborough became one of the first trading posts for the Dutch on the Hudson. During the early 20th century, the Astor, Rockefeller, and Vanderbilt families entertained guests on their river-view country estates in the Scarborough area. The Scarborough Historic District, including the Scarborough Presbyterian Church, is on the National Register of Historic Places. Across the street from the church is Sparta Cemetery, containing graves of local Revolutionary War veterans and the Leatherman. A notable building on the register is Beechwood, built in 1780 and considered one of the finest examples of Federal architecture in Westchester County. Beechwood was later purchased by Frank A. Vanderlip, who constructed the Scarborough School on the estate. The school was founded in 1913, and closed in 1978. Holly Hill is a notable house nearby. Hubert Rogers, a New York City attorney, had the house designed around 1927 by William Adams Delano; Rogers named it Weskora. After his death Brooke Astor purchased the estate, renaming it Holly Hill for its holly trees. Directly across from Holly Hill is the site used for the U.S. headquarters of Philips Research from 1965 to 2015, built on part of Waldheim, the former estate of James Speyer.

==== Chilmark ====

Chilmark (also known as Chilmark Park) is an unincorporated residential community of about , established in 1930, in northern Briarcliff Manor. The neighborhood was designed with Underhill Road as its main thoroughfare, running north–south. It was named after the village of Chilmark, England, the birthplace and early home of Thomas Macy (an ancestor of Valentine Everit Macy), who arrived in the colonies in 1635. The area is culturally significant for its association with the Macy family, whose members were active in New York and Westchester County during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Valentine Everit Macy and his wife, Edith Carpenter Macy, founded the community and aided in its development; Macy purchased several small family farms in present Chilmark in 1897. In 1925, Macy donated on Old Chappaqua Road for the first national Girl Scout camp, which later became the Edith Macy Conference Center, a conference and training facility owned and operated by the Girl Scouts of the USA. The Briarcliff Recreation Center was formerly the private Chilmark Club until the 1970s, when the village purchased the land for a recreation center and adjoining park. Macy&#x27;s residence in the area was the Chilmark estate, a Tudor-style stone and stucco mansion built in 1896 with a nine-hole golf course. The neighborhood hosts Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s Conservative temple Congregation Sons of Israel.

Chilmark features landscaped, winding roads designed to blend with the topography, access to transportation (including a commuter rail line and a highway and homes built in revival styles echoing Tudor and Gothic architecture; it is architecturally significant as an example of early-20th-century suburban design. During the 1920s Macy&#x27;s son, V.E. Macy Jr., founded the Chilmark Park Realty Corporation to sell land parcels. When he began marketing the area, he renovated or demolished existing homes to lend an air of development and built a private country club for use by Chilmark residents. The village of Briarcliff Manor later purchased the site, and operates it as Chilmark Park. To denote its development as an exclusive neighborhood, Macy planted distinctive shade trees along Underhill Road. Since its founding, additional homes have been built in Chilmark, most between 1955 and 1960. The developments expanded the area beyond its original ; it presently comprises Underhill Road and the streets immediately adjacent to it.
==== Village Center ====
The central business district, also known as the Village Center, is located on Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s main street on Pleasantville Road and continues on North State Road. The area has numerous businesses lining Pleasantville Road, a large expansion from the three stores that existed there in 1906. The business district is home to the village hall and a pocket park, and has brick sidewalks, period street lighting, and free parking. Farther south along the road is the Walter W. Law Memorial Park, and further east along the road are the three schools of the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District. The Village Center contains a number of pre-Revolutionary War houses, including the Whitson House, built during the 1770s and the former home of Richard Whitson (one of the Whitson brothers, after whom Whitson&#x27;s Corners was named); Buckhout House, also dating to the 1770s and named for the family who lived there for over a century and the oldest, Century Homestead, dating to about 1767 and first owned by Reuben Whitson. The Washburn House, another pre-Revolutionary house, was sold by the New York State Commission on Forfeiture to Joseph Washburn in 1775.

==== Central Briarcliff West ====

Central Briarcliff West is a neighborhood which has a number of mansions built by 20th-century millionaires who stayed at the Briarcliff Lodge and later built estates in the area. The lodge stood in the area and on the highest point of Walter Law&#x27;s estate from its construction in 1902 until it burned down in 2003. Other historic estates in the neighborhood include the Law family homes (built in 1902 for Walter Law&#x27;s children) and Law&#x27;s estate, the Manor House, all on Scarborough Road. The three estates for his children are Six Gables, Mt. Vernon, and Hillcrest. The Modernist Julian Street Jr. residence, designed by Wallace Harrison for Julian and Narcissa Vanderlip Street, was one of the first contemporary-style homes in Westchester. Ashridge, a large Greek Revival estate, was built around 1825.

==== The tree streets ====
The tree streets is a network of streets in the Mount Pleasant portion of the village. Several of the streets are named after regional trees, including Satinwood Lane, Larch Road, Elm Road, and Oak Road. Walter Law had rows of trees planted on streets named for the varieties, though many of these trees no longer adorn their streets. The first major development of the area occurred around 1902, though many houses in the neighborhood were constructed during a 1930s building boom, circling Jackson Road Park and near Todd Elementary School.

==== The Crossroads ====
The Crossroads is a group of 84 houses on streets named after local World War II veterans, including Schrade Road, Hazelton Circle, Matthes Road, and Dunn Lane. It was constructed at the end of World War II to provide affordable housing to returning veterans, and was completed in 1952.

== Demographics ==
=== Historical ===
Historically, Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s racial composition has not changed significantly. The village has seen a decrease in its non-Hispanic white population to 86 percent in 2010, down from 92 percent in 1990. The mid- to late-20th century saw an increase in the African-American population from 2.1 to 3.4 percent.

The village has experienced significant population growth, with it and neighboring communities undergoing more rapid growth than Westchester County overall. The period from 1950 to 1970 saw the greatest increase in population, with growth leveling off since then.

=== Modern ===
Briarcliff Manor is primarily non-commercial, with over 80 percent of village land residential. Approximately 99% of the buildings are residential; of these, 85.3% are single-family units. In the 2010 United States Census there were 7,867 people, 2,647 households, and 2,037 families living in 2,753 housing units. Of the 2,647 households, 39.7 percent had children under age 18 living with them; 68.5 percent were married couples living together, 6.6 percent were headed by women, 1.9 percent were single males and 23 percent were non-families. Twenty-one percent of all households were individuals, with 14.1 percent age 65 or older. Average household size was 2.71; average family size was 3.16, with a median age of 43.4 years. The 2015 American Community Survey (ACS) reported an estimated 2,636 households, 50 of which were held by unmarried partners. 34 of these were female householder and male partner households and 16 were male householder and male partner households. No male-female or female-female unmarried partner households were reported.

The village&#x27;s population density was . In 2010, its racial composition was 82.7 percent white, 3.3 percent African American, 0.1 percent Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 8.5 percent Asian American, and 3.1 percent from two (or more) races. Hispanic and Latino Americans made up 8.2 percent of the population.

The 2015 ACS estimated median household income at $141,170 and median family income was $183,047. Males had a median income of $124,000, with $82,660 for females; per capita income was $76,256.

Ancestry is primarily Italian and Irish, at 18.1 and 12.9 percents respectively, followed by American at 8.8, Russian at 8.5 and German at 8.4 percent.

Exact numbers on religious denominations in Briarcliff Manor are not readily available. Demographic statistics in the United States depend heavily on the United States Census Bureau, which cannot ask about religious affiliation as part of its decennial census. It does compile some national and statewide religious statistics, but these are not representative of a municipality the size of Briarcliff Manor. One report from 2010 offers religious affiliations for Westchester County. According to the data, 59.3% of county residents identified as Christian: 50.9% are Roman Catholic, 5.9% are mainline Protestants, 2% are Evangelical Protestants, and .5% are Eastern or Oriental Orthodox Christians. Residents who practice Judaism make up 10.1% of the population and practitioners of other faiths represent .9%. Note that these values are county-wide; municipal values could be significantly different.

== Economy ==
About five percent of Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s land is occupied by businesses. The village has three retail business areas, a general (non-retail) business area and scattered office buildings and laboratories. The village&#x27;s principal retail district is along Pleasantville and North State Roads.

The central business district primarily has retailers such as restaurants, cafes, small food markets, and specialty shops. The North State Road business district has a supermarket, a bank, a gas station, and a mixture of retail stores, and the other retail areas have national and local stores. The village has small offices and larger offices for the regional (or national) market, which were formerly housed by companies including Sony Electronics, Philips Research, and Wüsthof.

The village economy depends on education, health care and social services. Of the population aged 16 and older, 63 percent are in the labor force; 33 percent of those employed work outside Westchester County. About 13 percent of workers live and work in the village, and the average commute is 37.1 minutes. The unemployment rate for those 16 and older is 4.2%, while the unemployment rate for those aged 20 to 64 is 3.0%. Briarcliff Manor has a number of wealthy residents, and was rated 19th on CNNMoney&#x27;s 25 Top-Earning Towns in the U.S. An assessment by financial news corporation 24/7 Wall St., using data from the U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s American Community Survey from 2006 to 2010, rated the village&#x27;s school district the fifth-wealthiest in the United States and the third-wealthiest in New York.

In 2004, the top five employers in Briarcliff Manor were the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District, Philips Research, Trump National Golf Club, the Clear View School, and engineering firm Charles H. Sells. Other large employers were USI Holdings (a publicly traded insurer headquartered in the village), Atria Briarcliff Manor, Pace University, and the village (which employs 81 people).

== Arts and culture ==

The village symbol is the Briarcliff Rose, a more brightly colored offshoot of the American Beauty rose. Since 2006, the Briarcliff Rose has been used on village street signs. The Briarcliff Manor Garden Club, which also uses the Briarcliff rose as their symbol, was established in 1956. One of its primary functions is in planting, maintaining, and improving public gardens and grounds.

Briarcliff Manor has groups in several Scouting organizations, including Cub Scout Pack 6 and Boy Scout Troop 18. Pack 6 became the first Cub Scout pack in the village at its establishment in 1968; by 2002 it had over 70 cubs in 12 dens. The village&#x27;s first Boy Scout troop was Troop 1 Briarcliff, founded before 1919. Sources cite Bill Buffman as the first Scoutmaster and John Hersey as the troop&#x27;s first Eagle Scout. The first Girl Scout troop in the village was founded in 1917 by Louise Miller and Mrs. Alfred Jones, and the first Brownie troop was founded in 1929.

The Briarcliff Manor Community Bonfire is a winter holiday event at Law Park, hosted by the village and the Briarcliff Friends of the Arts, involving live music (primarily seasonal and holiday songs), refreshments, and craft projects for children. Another annual community event is the Memorial Day parade, a tradition in Briarcliff Manor for more than fifty years. Before the parade begins, the Municipal Building&#x27;s bell is rung to commemorate firefighters who have died in the previous year; the parade ends at the village&#x27;s war memorial in Law Park, where wreaths are laid on the monument. The holiday has been celebrated in the village since the early 1900s, though initially involving large family picnics, with parades reserved for the Fourth of July.

=== Historical society ===
Briarcliff Manor maintains strong ties to its history and traditions. During Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s 1952 semicentennial, nine people served on the Historical Committee and published a village history book. In March 1974, after the mayor appointed twelve people for a 75th anniversary committee, the committee began by forming the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society (BMSHS). The historical society published an updated village history (&quot;A Village Between Two Rivers: Briarcliff Manor&quot;) in 1977, marking the 75th anniversary of the village. The historical society was initially located at the since-demolished Briarcliff Middle School building; it later moved to the second floor of a realty building on Pleasantville Road, and moved back to the school building after it was leased by Pace University. On March 21, 2010, the BMSHS was given a permanent location at the Eileen O&#x27;Connor Weber Historical Center, established as part of the expanded Briarcliff Manor Public Library. Members of the historical society joined the nine-member Centennial Committee in 2002 to organize events for Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s centennial.

The Centennial Committee and BMSHS helped organize several events for the village&#x27;s 2002 centennial celebration, including the Centennial Variety Show at the Briarcliff High School auditorium in a sold-out two-night run on April 26–27, 2002. The two-act show consisted of interpretations of village life by village organizations and a revue of Briarcliff Manor history in skits and songs. Other society-sponsored events have included tours of homes and churches, bus tours, Hudson River cruises on historic boats such as the M/V &quot;Commander&quot; (built in 1917 and listed on the national and state registers of historic places), dances, antique-car exhibits, day trips to historic points of interest, art exhibits, and events with authors and elected officials.

=== Historic sites ===

Briarcliff Manor is home to a number of historic buildings and districts. Buildings on the National Register of Historic Places include All Saints&#x27; Episcopal Church (added May 14, 2002), Carrie Chapman Catt&#x27;s house Juniper Ledge (added March 4, 2006) and several structures in the Scarborough Historic District (added September 7, 1984). Part of the Old Croton Aqueduct State Historic Park, controlled by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, lies within the village. The Old Croton Aqueduct is on the National Register and is a National Historic Landmark.

Although Catt&#x27;s house Juniper Ledge is within Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s postal boundaries, the property is located within the municipal boundaries of the nearby town of New Castle. Briarcliff Manor composer and historian Carmino Ravosa initiated the house&#x27;s preservation by researching and initiating the nomination of Juniper Ledge to the National Register.
=== Houses of worship ===
Briarcliff Manor is home to seven Christian churches and two synagogues; three churches (Holy Innocents Anglican Church, Saint Mary&#x27;s Church and Scarborough Presbyterian Church) are in Scarborough. Other churches in the village are All Saints&#x27; Episcopal Church, St. Theresa&#x27;s Catholic Church, Faith Lutheran Brethren Church, and Briarcliff Congregational Church (United Church of Christ). Jewish synagogues Congregation Sons of Israel and Chabad Lubavitch of Briarcliff Manor &amp; Ossining are in Chilmark.

Saint Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Church, founded in 1839 by William Creighton as Saint Mary&#x27;s Church, Beechwood, is Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s oldest church; it was reincorporated in 1945 as Saint Mary&#x27;s Church of Scarborough. The granite church was built by local stonemasons and paid for by Creighton&#x27;s wealthy neighbors, including Commodore Matthew Perry, James Watson Webb, William Aspinwall, and Ambrose Kingsland. The church is in near-original condition, with a design based on the 14th-century Gothic St. Mary&#x27;s parish church in Scarborough, England and the only church with a complete set of William Jay Bolton stained-glass windows. The church, built in 1851, is a contributing property to the National Register-listed Scarborough Historic District. The Sleepy Hollow Country Club surrounds the church grounds on three sides. Notable parishioners included Commodore Matthew C. Perry and Washington Irving. Irving, author of &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;, brought the ivy surrounding the church from Abbotsford (home of Walter Scott). On July 5, 2015, Saint Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Church closed after 175 years in operation; the Church of South India&#x27;s Congregation of the Hudson Valley moved in that November.

Scarborough Presbyterian Church, given to the community by Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt Shepard and her husband Colonel Elliott Fitch Shepard (who lived on the nearby Woodlea estate), was the first church in the United States with an electric organ. Built in 1895 and designed by Augustus Haydel (a nephew of Stanford White) and Shepard (a nephew of Elliott Shepard)—who designed the 1899 Fabbri Mansion in Manhattan—the church property is also part of the Scarborough Historic District.

All Saints&#x27; Episcopal Church is a stone church also on the National Register of Historic Places. It was founded in 1854 by John David Ogilby, whose summer estate and family home in Ireland were the namesakes of Briarcliff Manor. The Gothic Revival church, built on Ogilby&#x27;s summer estate, was designed by Richard Upjohn and modeled on Saint Andrew&#x27;s in Bemerton, England. The church, with an 1883 Stick style rectory and 1904 Arts and Crafts-style parish hall, is an example of the modest English Gothic parish church popular in the region during the mid-19th century.

The parish of St. Theresa&#x27;s Catholic Church was established in 1926 with thirty-six families, and the present church was dedicated on September 23, 1928. The rectory of the church was the original farmhouse of Briarcliff Farms.

Faith Lutheran Brethren Church had its 1959 beginning in a white chapel in Scarsdale. Its congregation then sold the chapel and moved to its current site in Briarcliff Manor. The church, built largely through volunteer labor by the congregation&#x27;s twelve families, held its first service on October 8, 1967. A nursery-school program, the Little School, began in 1972 and the church also sponsors women&#x27;s and youth groups.

Briarcliff Congregational Church, built in 1896, has windows by Louis Comfort Tiffany, William Willet, J&amp;R Lamb Studios, Hardman &amp; Co., and Woodhaven. The church began in a small, one-room schoolhouse (known as the &quot;white school&quot;), built around 1865 and used as a school, a religious school, and a house of worship for up to 60 people. In 1896, George A. Todd Jr. asked Walter Law to support the construction of a new church. Law donated the church land, making his new church a Congregational one so the entire community (regardless of religious background) could attend. The nave and a Norman-style tower were built first, in an English-parish style with Gothic windows. When the congregation outgrew the church, Law funded a northern section (including transepts and apse) which was dedicated in 1905. He donated the church organ (replacing it in 1924), four Tiffany windows, and the manse across the street. The church housed a weekly indoor farmers&#x27; market at its parish house from 2008 to 2011, when the market was moved to Pace University&#x27;s Briarcliff Campus.

Congregation Sons of Israel, self-described as egalitarian Conservative, was the first synagogue in Briarcliff Manor. The congregation was formed in 1891 by eleven men in Ossining, and until 1902 services were held in homes and stores. That year, the congregation (now twenty-three families) purchased a building on Durston Avenue; the Jewish Cemetery, established in 1900 on Dale Avenue, is still in use. In 1920, the synagogue, numbering forty-five families, established a religious school. After outgrowing its facilities, it purchased a site on Waller Avenue and completed a new synagogue in 1922. During the 1950s the congregation purchased the Mead Farm on Pleasantville Road, which it has used since 1960.

Chabad Lubavitch of Briarcliff Manor &amp; Ossining was established around 2004, and is located on Orchard Road in Chilmark. On March 18, 2015, the organization purchased a building previously owned by the Ossining Heights United Methodist Church, on Campwoods Road in the village of Ossining. Chabad Lubavitch plans to renovate the building significantly before making it its first permanent synagogue.

== Sports ==

Briarcliff High School offers intramural sports and fields junior varsity and varsity teams in sixteen sports as the Briarcliff Bears. During the 38 years that Pace University operated its Briarcliff campus, it maintained fourteen intercollegiate varsity sports teams which played at the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s (NCAA) Division II level.

Briarcliff Manor has a history of auto racing. The First American International Road Race was hosted by the village on April 24, 1908. The course went throughout Westchester, starting and finishing in Briarcliff Manor. The prize trophy donated by Walter Law was valued at $10,000 ($ in ). The winner, Lewis Strang in an Isotta Fraschini, covered the in five hours and fourteen minutes. More than 300,000 people watched the race throughout Westchester County, and the village had more than 100,000 visitors that day.

On November 12, 1934, the Automobile Racing Club of America held another road race in Briarcliff Manor. It was the first amateur race in the United States, hosted by the wealthy Collier family of nearby Pocantico Hills. Brothers Sam, Miles, and Barron Jr. had begun hosting informal races in the area in the early 1930s, and formed the racing club in 1933. The 1934 race was won by Langdon Quimby, driving a Willys 77, in a time of two hours and seven minutes on the course. The race was held again on June 23, 1935; Quimby won again, four minutes faster than the previous year. In 1977, during the village&#x27;s 75th anniversary, fifteen old racing cars participated in a motorcade around the 1934 race&#x27;s route. In 2008, the village commemorated the first race&#x27;s centennial in a parade featuring about 60 antique cars.

== Parks and recreation ==
Briarcliff Manor has about of recreational facilities and parks, all of which are accessible to the public. The village&#x27;s library houses its recreation department, which has four staff and a six-member advisory committee, and provides recreation programming for the village. The village&#x27;s Department of Public Works maintains the village&#x27;s parks and recreational facilities with one parks foreman and two groundskeeping personnel. The following are available to Briarcliff Manor residents:
* The Briarcliff-Peekskill Trailway runs from the village to the Blue Mountain Reservation in Peekskill. The parkland was acquired for use by the Briarcliff-Peekskill Parkway (now part of New York State Route 9A); the parkway later changed course, freeing the land for trail use.
* Chilmark Park, on Macy Road, formerly the Chilmark Country Club. The park has six tennis courts (two clay, two all-weather, and two green clay), a half-court basketball court, a soccer field, a baseball-softball field, and a playground. Renovation of the athletic fields and basketball court and the addition of a restroom are planned.
* The Hardscrabble Wilderness Area is a network of wilderness trails.
* The Jackson Road Park, dedicated in 1975, features two half-court basketball courts: one with a standard rim and one with a rim for younger players. The playground was renovated in 2005. About half of the park is undeveloped wetlands.
* The Kate Kennard Trail, named for the late daughter of a former mayor, was dedicated in 1988. It begins on Long Hill West, west of the Aspinwall Road intersection.
* Lynn McCrum Field, named for Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s second village manager, was dedicated in June 1999. The field, at the corner of Chappaqua Road and Route 9A, has a multi-purpose playing field for baseball, softball, and soccer, parking for 50 cars, and a utility building with restrooms.
* Neighborhood Park, dedicated in 1954 and augmented in 1958 and 1964, is at the corner of Whitson and Fuller Roads adjacent to Schrade Road. The Whitson Road side of the park has a youth baseball field; a basketball court and playground are accessible from the Schrade Road entrance.
* Nichols Nature Area, accessible from Nichols Place, is a steeply sloped site acquired in 1973 as part of a residential subdivision.
* The Old Croton Aqueduct State Historic Park, running along the Old Croton Aqueduct, crosses the village between Broadway and the Hudson River. Its trail, following the aqueduct from the Croton Reservoir to New York City, is a popular bicycling and running path maintained by New York State. Access from the village is from Scarborough Road north of the Scarborough Fire Station.
* Pine Road Park, an undeveloped parcel acquired in 1948 and augmented in 1963, lies between Pine Road and Long Hill Road East.
* The Pocantico Park, Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s largest park, was acquired in 1948 and augmented in 1963, 1964, and 1967. Abutting the Pocantico River, it is home to a large number and variety of regional fauna and has marked hiking trails.
* The Recreation Center, purchased by the village in 1980, is the former Chilmark Country Club clubhouse and provides seasonal indoor recreation. Community organizations using the center include the Briarcliff Manor Garden Club, the Senior Citizens Club and the Max Pavey Chess Club.
* Scarborough Park, a park acquired in 1908 and developed in the early 1900s near the Scarborough train station, is surrounded on three sides by the Hudson River. is above-water land, and the rest is below the Hudson.
* The Village Youth Center, near the central business district, has a deck, a patio, and a lighted outdoor basketball court. It also provides an indoor facility for community programs and activities.
* Walter W. Law Memorial Park (originally Liberty Park), in the center of the village on Pleasantville Road, is a park which was donated to the village by Law in 1904. Its outdoor pool complex, added in July 1927 at a cost of $8,641 ($ in ), has a wading pool and a main pool, which was Westchester&#x27;s first public swimming pool. After a complete reconstruction of the pool in 1977, a two-story bathhouse and pavilion was completed in 2001 as part of a rehabilitation project, which included paved walkways and a veterans&#x27; memorial. The park was rededicated on Veterans Day 2001. It has four lighted tennis courts: three clay and one all-weather. The pond was used for ice skating and hockey until the village bought a temporary rink for one of the tennis courts; the shallow rink freezes days earlier than the pond, and the tennis court lighting system allows easier skating at night. Adjacent to the tennis courts is a playground. Two platform tennis courts are north of the park, and the Briarcliff Manor Public Library and Community Center is on its eastern edge. In 2016, a memorial to Medal of Honor recipient John Koelsch was constructed in the park and dedicated on Veterans Day that year.
* The Westchester County Bike Trail (also known as the North County Trailway) is a rail trail criss-crossing forests, towns, and highways. One highlight is the New Croton Reservoir and its former railway bridge. Trail access from the village is behind the library, off Pleasantville Road. The trail extends north (primarily along Route 100) to Baldwin Place in Somers, and south along Route 9A to Eastview in Mount Pleasant.

Although there are no public golf courses in Briarcliff Manor, the village has two large country clubs: Sleepy Hollow Country Club in Scarborough and Trump National Golf Club, owned by Donald Trump. The Trump property has been home to several golf clubs since the early 20th century, including Briarcliff Country Club, Briar Hills Country Club, and Briar Hall Golf and Country Club. Trump purchased the site in 1996 and opened the club in 2002. The main building of Sleepy Hollow Country Club was formerly Woodlea, the 140-room Renaissance Revival mansion of Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt Shepard and her husband Elliott Fitch Shepard. The building, which has about , is one of the largest houses in the United States.

== Government ==

The village government is led by a mayor and four trustees, all unpaid officials elected at-large for two-year terms. The current mayor is Steven A. Vescio, elected in 2019. A full-time, appointed village manager handles day-to-day community affairs; the first was Max Vogel in 1967. The current Village Manager is Josh Ringel. Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s government operates from the village hall, which houses the Justice Court and the administrative offices of the Village (except for DPW and Recreation). , there are 5,531 registered voters in Briarcliff Manor. the village&#x27;s government employed 69 people full-time, including their building department, planning board, department of public works, the recreation department, the police department, the architectural review advisory committee, and the conservation advisory council. The village government administered a 2017–18 operating budget of approximately $28 million which predominantly went towards public works, police protection, debt service, and recreational facilities and services.

Briarcliff Manor maintains a voting custom that dates to at least around 1905. In addition to its customary general election, held at the same day in every municipality in New York, the village has a nonpartisan caucus, a town meeting-style forum to determine officeholders. The system of the People&#x27;s Caucus is largely unique to the village, and has been described as an extension of the New England town hall concept. The People&#x27;s Caucus, officially formed in 1946, chooses candidates by majority vote two months before the village election, where the candidates usually run unopposed, turning the election into a formality. The caucus is open to citizens of 18 years or over who have lived in the village for at least a month; voter registration is not required. Voters and candidates do not declare party affiliations, instead candidates present their platforms in early January of each year, and weeks later the caucus meets again to vote.

In the Westchester County Board of Legislators, the western portion of Briarcliff Manor (in Ossining) is represented by Democrat and Majority Leader Catherine Borgia in District 9, while the eastern part (in Mount Pleasant) is represented by Conservative Margaret A. Cunzio in District 3. In the New York State Legislature, the western portion of the village is represented by Democrat Sandy Galef for the New York State Assembly&#x27;s 95th District, while the eastern portion is represented by Democrat Thomas Abinanti for the Assembly&#x27;s 92nd District. Democrat David Carlucci represents the Ossining portion of the village for the New York Senate&#x27;s 38th District, and Republican Terrence Murphy represents the Mount Pleasant end of the village in the Senate&#x27;s 40th District. In Congress, the village is represented by in the House of Representatives from New York&#x27;s 17th District and Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer in the Senate.

=== Crime ===

The Briarcliff Manor police force was founded by Edward Cashman, a one-person force who covered his beat on foot and by bicycle. The crime rate was low during both world wars, and village police work primarily involved rounding up animals (as the constabulary had done since before the Revolution). Most other cases were traffic violations, due to the village&#x27;s size and parkway access. During the 1980s (as in the 1940s), the police blotter primarily consisted of accidents and traffic violations on the four major roads traversing the village; a 1939 village history asserted that &quot;Briarcliff has never had a serious crime&quot;. Burglaries have been primarily residential, and murder is rare. In 1989, when the police force considered replacing its .38 six-shot revolvers with semiautomatic 9mm pistols, opinion was divided; village officials could not remember when an officer last fired a gun on duty.

In its study of 2012 FBI Uniform Crime Reports, national realtor Movoto LLC assessed Briarcliff Manor as the second-safest municipality in New York, with the second-lowest crime rate in the state. According to the FBI reports, the village had no reported violent crimes in 2012 and a resident had a 1-in-569 chance of being a crime victim. In 2014, security system company Safe Choice Security used the same data and assessed Briarcliff Manor as the safest municipality in New York. A SafeWise report in 2016 using 2014 FBI data assessed the village as the third safest in New York.

== Education ==

=== Early childhood education ===
Garden House School is an elementary school in London; it also runs preschools in New York City and in Briarcliff Manor, at the Briarcliff Congregational Church&#x27;s parish house. Briarcliff Nursery School is a preschool on Morningside Drive, just outside village borders in Ossining. It was established in 1947 at Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s old recreation building; it moved to Walter Law&#x27;s Manor House and then to the William Kingsland mansion, and moved to its current location in 1955.

=== Primary and secondary schools ===

The village is home to the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District, which covers of land and most of the village of Briarcliff Manor and an unincorporated portion of the town of Mount Pleasant. Parts of Briarcliff Manor not covered by the school district include Scarborough and Chilmark and total 28% of the municipality&#x27;s area; these areas are part of the Ossining Union Free School District.

The Briarcliff Manor district serves over 1,000 students and includes Todd Elementary School, Briarcliff Middle School, and Briarcliff High School. From Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s settlement until 1918, students in grades 1–8 were taught within one school facility; from 1919 until the 1940s, students in grades 1–12 were as well. The district is noted for its annual high-school musicals. The elementary school (opened in 1953) is named after George A. Todd, Jr., who was the village&#x27;s first teacher, first superintendent of schools, and taught for over 40 years. The middle school became a Blue Ribbon School in 2005.

Briarcliff Manor has been home to a number of schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 students, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook&#x27;s Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915. Miss Tewksbury&#x27;s School and later Mrs. Marshall&#x27;s Day &amp; Boarding School for Little Girls was at Dysart House. Miss Knox&#x27;s School ran from 1905 in Pocantico Lodge, a hotel on Pleasantville Road under Briarcliff Lodge management. When it burned down in 1912, the school moved to Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. Since 1954, the Knox School has been located at St. James, New York. The Scarborough School was first Montessori school in the United States; it was located at the Beechwood estate from 1913 until it closed in 1978. Since then, The Clear View School has run a day treatment program for 83 students from nursery school age to 21 there. The Macfadden School ran from 1939 to 1950 at the William Kingsland mansion in the village. The village&#x27;s Catholic church, St. Theresa&#x27;s, operated a school for pre-kindergarten to eighth grade students from 1965 to 2013. At its closing, the school had approximately 150 students and 20 employees.

=== Higher education ===

The first institute for higher education in the village was the School of Practical Agriculture and Horticulture, which Walter Law helped establish on his Briarcliff Farms in 1900. The school taught students ages 16 to 35 in crop and livestock care. In 1902, the school moved to a larger location near Poughkeepsie and closed a year later due to a lack of funding. In addition, Briarcliff Manor has been the location for several colleges. Briarcliff Junior College was founded in 1903 at the Briarcliff Lodge, and moved near Briarcliff Congregational Church, on land Walter Law donated, in 1905. Among its trustees were Howard Deering Johnson, Norman Cousins, Carl Carmer, Thomas K. Finletter, William Zorach, Eduard C. Lindeman, and Lyman Bryson. Ordway Tead was chairman of the board of trustees, and his wife Clara was the college&#x27;s first president. The school gradually improved its academic scope and standing, and was registered with the State Education Department and accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 1944. In 1951, the Board of Regents authorized the college to grant Associate of Arts and Associate of Applied Science degrees. The following year, the Army Map Service selected the college as the only one in the country for professional training in cartography. In 1956, the junior college started issuing bachelor&#x27;s degrees, and became known as Briarcliff College. In 1977 Pace University bought Briarcliff College and the Spanish Renaissance-style Briarcliff Grade School building, incorporating them into its Pleasantville campus.

Pace University operated the school building until its demolition in 1996, and the Briarcliff College campus until 2015. At the Briarcliff Lodge property, the Edgewood Park School operated from 1936 to 1954, and King&#x27;s College subsequently operated there from 1955 to 1994, also using the lodge building and other dormitories and academic buildings.

== Media ==

Briarcliff Manor has been the subject, inspiration, or location for literature, television episodes, and films. Much of James Patterson&#x27;s 2005 novel, &quot;Honeymoon&quot;, is set in the village (where Patterson is a part-year resident). Sharon Anne Salvato&#x27;s &quot;Briarcliff Manor&quot; takes place on the fictional estate of Briarcliff Manor, and the novel was published by Stein and Day in the village. The pilot episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; was filmed in the central business district, where Briarcliff Manor Pharmacy, Briarcliff Wines &amp; Liquors, and Briarcliff Hardware are the backdrop for the &quot;Show Us Your Guns&quot; sketch; the episode aired October 11, 1975. As well, Briarcliff College&#x27;s president Josiah Bunting III was the half-brother of the show&#x27;s co-creator Dick Ebersol; while President, Bunting let Ebersol film the show at the college for free. In &quot;Pan Am&quot;, Sleepy Hollow Country Club was the setting for much of the series&#x27; third episode. In February and March 2013, the final three episodes of the first season of television show &quot;The Following&quot; were filmed in and around the former town of Ossining police station in Briarcliff Manor. In early 2016, filming for the Amazon Studios series &quot;Crisis in Six Scenes&quot; filmed at Ashridge, on Scarborough Road. The series is directed by and stars Woody Allen. Sleepy Hollow Country Club is also a popular filming location for television shows and films.

Films shot in the village include &quot;The Seven Sisters&quot;, &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot;, &quot;Savages&quot;, &quot;Bed of Roses&quot;, &quot;Super Troopers&quot;, &quot;Analyze That&quot;, &quot;First Born&quot;, &quot;American Gangster&quot;, and &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot;. &quot;The Seven Sisters&quot;, a 1915 production, was filmed at the Briarcliff Lodge. The 1970 &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot; and the 1972 Merchant Ivory film &quot;Savages&quot; were filmed at the Beechwood mansion in Scarborough. &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; was released in 1996, and was filmed at an 1860s house on Scarborough Road which was the home of Eileen O&#x27;Connor Weber. &quot;Super Troopers&quot;, released in 2001, was partially filmed on the Taconic State Parkway from Poughkeepsie to Briarcliff Manor. &quot;Analyze That&quot;, a film from 2002, was filmed in the village and nearby locations, including the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in the village of Ossining. The 2007 film &quot;First Born&quot; was filmed at a house in Briarcliff Manor. &quot;American Gangster&quot;, also released in 2007, includes scenes filmed at two village houses. Some parts of the 2012 film &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot; were filmed at the village&#x27;s entranceway to the Taconic State Parkway and at other roads in the village. The 2013 dark comedy &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; was partially filmed at Pace University&#x27;s Briarcliff campus, adapting its dining hall into a 1960s Fred Harvey restaurant in an Illinois Tollway oasis.

Print media has been produced in the village since the early 20th century, when Briarcliff Farms operated a printing press and office, producing &quot;Briarcliff Farms&quot;, the &quot;Briarcliff Bulletin&quot; in 1900, the monthly &quot;Briarcliff Outlook&quot; in 1903 followed by &quot;The Briarcliff Once-a-Week&quot; in 1908 (all edited by Arthur W. Emerson). The Briarcliff Community Club, a social organization created by the village in 1910 and which existed until 1927, later printed &quot;Community Notes&quot;. Later papers include &quot;The Briarcliff Forum&quot; (founded in 1926) and the 1930s &quot;Briarcliff Weekly&quot;. Briarcliff Manor is the city of license of WXPK, and other media outlets include the Briarcliff Daily Voice, News 12, Patch Media, and the &quot;River Journal&quot;. Official newspapers for the village include &quot;The Journal News&quot; and &quot;The Gazette&quot;.

== Infrastructure ==
The Briarcliff Manor Police Department and the volunteer Briarcliff Manor Fire Department are stationed at the Briarcliff Manor Village Hall. The Police Department has 19 personnel—a chief, lieutenant, five sergeants, and twelve patrol officers—and one part-time civilian. The Briarcliff Manor Fire Department Ambulance Corps provides emergency medical transport with two ambulances. The village is also serviced by two private EMS providers.

Briarcliff Manor has a post office in its central business district on Pleasantville Road and in Scarborough by the train station. The first post office opened in 1881 in the first train station; it was named for Whitson&#x27;s Corners. The post office was renamed the Briarcliff Manor Post Office in 1897. When the station building was moved to Millwood, New York, the post office was temporarily moved to a building near the new station. The following post office, a concrete building, was to its east on Pleasantville Road. It was demolished to make way for the Briarcliff-Peekskill Parkway. The post office then moved to an inn, and subsequently to John Whitson&#x27;s house, the Crossways. In 1933 a replacement building was constructed in the central business district, followed in 1953 by a new brick building next to the present-day village hall. The current post office was constructed at a cost of $500,000 ($ in ) and was completed in November 1978. The building is located just south of its prior location. Post office house-to-house delivery began on November 17, 1952.

Consolidated Edison provides electric power and natural gas to the village, and the Briarcliff Manor Department of Public Works supplies water from the Catskill Aqueduct to the village&#x27;s water system. The department also maintains the sewer system, village vehicles, roads, and grounds, operates a recycling center, and removes snow. In 2016 the village recycled 53 percent of its waste, about the same as the county average of 54 percent. The department, primarily rooted in the 1941 sale of Walter Law&#x27;s Briarcliff Table Water Company, began with a state-mandated street commissioner. The commissioner in 1914 was Arthur Brown; asked by village officials if he needed an automobile, Brown replied that he preferred a horse but would use an automobile if the village purchased it (it did not). The department has about thirty vehicles and employs twenty-nine people.

The department operates the Long Hill Road water treatment plant and village pump stations. The Long Hill Road pump house is the primary water supply for the village with supply capacity exceeding 3.5 million gallons per day (MGD). Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s average daily water supply demand is 1.45 MGD with a peak demand of 3.5 MGD. Briarcliff Manor has four water storage tanks (at Rosecliff, Farm Road, the former King&#x27;s College, and the Edith Macy Conference Center) and two pump stations (the Long Hill Road pump house and the Dalmeny Road pump station).

=== Transportation ===
The village&#x27;s transportation system includes highways, streets, and a rail line; its low population density favors automobiles. Briarcliff Manor is accessible by the controlled-access Taconic State Parkway; it can also be reached by U.S. Route 9, New York State Route 9A and New York State Route 100, which traverse the village north to south. East-west travel is more difficult; Long Hill, Pine, Elm, and Scarborough roads are narrow, winding, and hilly. Routes 9 and 9A are the most heavily traversed roadways in the village.

According to the National Bridge Inventory, Briarcliff Manor has 15 bridges, with estimated daily traffic at 204,000 vehicles. Briarcliff Manor has 64 roads, with a total length of . Twelve are named after trees, eleven after local residents and eight after veterans, and most have the road type of &quot;lane&quot; or &quot;avenue&quot;, while the only &quot;street&quot; in the village is Stafford Street. The village&#x27;s oldest existing road is Washburn Road, on which is the oldest standing house in the village, Century Homestead. The longest road in the village, at , is Pleasantville Road; the shortest is Pine Court, . Around the time when the Briarcliff Lodge was active, Briarcliff Manor roadways were constructed of macadam and lined with concrete drains and stone fences. Early in Briarcliff Manor&#x27;s history, the first person to own an automobile was Henry Law (son of Walter Law), who owned a buckboard with an engine.

The Metro-North Railroad Hudson Line&#x27;s Scarborough station offers direct service to New York&#x27;s Grand Central Terminal, and is the primary public transport to the city. About 750 commuters board southbound trains during the morning rush hour, most driving to the station. Westchester County&#x27;s Bee-Line Bus System provides service to areas near the village center on routes 14, 15, and 19, and services the Scarborough neighborhood with routes 11 and 13.

Rail transportation in the village began on December 13, 1880, with the small Whitson&#x27;s Station on the New York City &amp; Northern Railroad (later the New York and Putnam Railroad). Before this time, residents would utilize the Ossining station, built in 1848. Walter Law replaced the 1880 station building in 1906 with a new structure in the style of his Briarcliff Lodge, with Mission style furniture and rugs. The old station was moved to Millwood, New York, around that time to become its station; it fell out of use and was demolished May 9, 2012, although plans exist for the construction of a replica. Law&#x27;s Briarcliff station became the public library in 1959.

<doc id="127546" wikidata="Q928168" url="?curid=127546" title="Bronxville, New York">
<text>Bronxville is a village in Westchester County, New York, United States, located approximately north of Midtown Manhattan. It is part of the town of Eastchester. The village comprises one square mile (2.5 km2) of land in its entirety, approximately 20% of the town of Eastchester. As of the 2020 U.S. census, Bronxville had a population of 6,656.

==History==
The region that includes the contemporary village of Bronxville was deeded to British colonists in 1666, but first settled by Europeans in the early 18th century. The two founding inhabitants were the Underhill and Morgan families. The Underhills built a sawmill and a gristmill, which was the first factory in the area, on the Bronx River. After they built a wooden bridge, the area became known as Underhill&#x27;s Crossing.

Millionaire real-estate and pharmaceutical mogul William Van Duzer Lawrence sparked the development of Bronxville as an affluent suburb of New York City by building grand homes in a rustic setting. The area became &quot;Bronxville&quot; when the village was formally established. The population grew in the second half of the 19th century when railroads enabled commuters from Westchester County to work in New York City. Lawrence&#x27;s influence can be seen throughout the community, including the historic Lawrence Park neighborhood, the Houlihan Lawrence Real Estate Corporation, and Lawrence Hospital.

The village was home to an arts colony in the early 20th century, when many noteworthy houses were built by prominent and casual architects. After the Bronx River Parkway was completed in 1925, the village expanded rapidly with the construction of several apartment buildings and townhouses, many of them built by the Lawrence family. As of 1959, the family continued to own or manage 97% of the rental market. 

The Gramatan Hotel on Sunset Hill was a residence hotel in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Gramatan was the name of the chief of the local Siwanoy Indian tribe that was centered in the Gramatan Rock area above Bronxville Station. Chief Gramatan sold the land to the settlers. The hotel was demolished in 1970, and a complex of townhouses was built on the site in 1980.

Elizabeth Clift Bacon, General George Armstrong Custer&#x27;s widow, lived in Bronxville, and her house still stands to this day.

St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church, located in the downtown area, was attended by the Kennedys when they were residents from 1929 to about 1938 before moving to London; Edward Kennedy returned to St. Joseph&#x27;s in 1958 for his wedding to Joan Bennett. Two years later, in the 1960 Presidential Election voters in the Village overwhelmingly chose Richard Nixon over Edward&#x27;s brother, John, by a 5-to-1 margin.

The US Post Office–Bronxville was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Other sites on the National Register are the Bronxville Women&#x27;s Club, Lawrence Park Historic District, and Masterton-Dusenberry House.

==Postal code==
Bronxville&#x27;s 10708 ZIP Code covers the village of Bronxville proper, plus Chester Heights and other sections of Eastchester, parts of Tuckahoe, and Lawrence Park West, Cedar Knolls, Armour Villa, and other sections of Yonkers. These areas are collectively known as &quot;Bronxville P.O.&quot; This brings the ZIP Code&#x27;s population to 22,411 (2000 census), covering an area more than twice as large as the municipality of Bronxville itself and encompassing several institutions, including Sarah Lawrence College.

==Education==
Bronxville was home to Concordia College, a liberal arts college operated by the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. The college was shuttered on January 28, 2021, following financial difficulties accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Plans are set for the campus to become acquired by nearby Iona University. In 2021, the purchase by Iona College, New Rochelle, NY was completed as the site for their new Health Sciences campus. Adjacent to the Concordia College campus is the Chapel School—a pre-K-8 school affiliated with the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod. 

The Bronxville Public School is known as The Bronxville School. The school was started as a progressive educational institution in 1922.

St. Joseph School is a Catholic parochial school run by St. Joseph&#x27;s Church. It was established in 1951, and schools children from kindergarten through eighth grade.

==Parks and recreation==
The Village of Bronxville has more than of parkland including athletic fields, woodlands, and a very small part of the Bronx River Parkway Reservation. The Reservation, Westchester’s oldest park, was created as an adjunct to the Bronx River Parkway that opened in 1925, and was the first linear park in the United States. The Reservation features ponds, wooden footbridges and hundreds of varieties of native trees and shrubs. The park is owned by Westchester County, and it is a favorite place for bicycling, walking, running, and nature study. It is sometimes referred to by locals as the &quot;Duck Pond&quot;.

The Bronxville School&#x27;s athletic fields contain a football field, three smaller fields used for various sports like field hockey and lacrosse, and a running track (which is only 380 meters in Lane 1 because of space issues). Bacon Woodlands, located on Kensington Road, is a natural rock outcropping which has been left in its natural state, the flatter portion of which is used as an informal play area by children. Scout Field, a Westchester County Park which is located predominantly in Yonkers and Mount Vernon but is controlled by Bronxville, is heavily utilized by the Bronxville schools&#x27; soccer, football, baseball, and cross-country running programs. In 2006, Chambers Field was replaced with turf, which was funded by the community and parents of athletes in Bronxville.

<text>Chappaqua ( ) is a hamlet and census-designated place in the town of New Castle, in northern Westchester County, New York, United States. It is approximately north of New York City. The hamlet is served by the Chappaqua station of the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line. In the New York State Legislature it is within the New York State Assembly&#x27;s 93rd district and the New York Senate&#x27;s 40th district. In Congress the village is in New York&#x27;s 17th District.

Chappaqua was founded by a group of Quakers in the 1730s and was the home of Horace Greeley, &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; editor and U.S. congressman. He now names Chappaqua&#x27;s high school.

A few notable people have called Chappaqua home. Leo Esaki, a Japanese physicist, was living in the town when he won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1973. Since the late 1990s, the 42nd president of the United States, Bill Clinton, and the 67th secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, have lived there.

==History==
In the early 1730s, a group of Quakers moved north from Purchase, New York, to settle in present-day Chappaqua. They built their homes on Quaker Road (more recently, Quaker Street; Quaker Road still exists but is no longer in the town center) and held their meetings at the home of Abel Weeks. Their meeting house was built in 1753 and still holds weekly meetings each Sunday. The area around the meeting house, known as Old Chappaqua Historic District, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Horace Greeley&#x27;s home, known as Rehoboth and built by Greeley himself, still stands in Chappaqua. It is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places along with Chappaqua Railroad Depot and Depot Plaza, Church of Saint Mary the Virgin and Greeley Grove, and the Greeley House.

Various spellings were used for the name they heard Native Americans use for their valley and hillside. It was an Algonquian word, &quot;shah-pah-ka&quot;, and it meant &quot;the rustling land&quot; or &quot;the rattling land,&quot; or a place where nothing is heard but the rustling of the wind in the leaves. The Quakers spelled it Shapiqua, Shapaqua, Shapequa, Shappaqua, and, finally, Chappaqua. Their meeting was often referred to as the Shapequa Meeting as early as 1745.

On March 18, 1791, the government of New York decided to split the overly large town of North Castle (jokingly called &quot;the two saddlebags&quot;) into two smaller towns, one of which was named New Castle. The border was drawn from the southwest corner of Bedford to the northeast edge of Mount Pleasant. New Castle&#x27;s borders have remained the same since 1791, except for a small piece of land received from Somers in 1846 and the secession of Mount Kisco in 1978.

Chappaqua had great streams such as the Saw Mill River and Roaring Brook. These bodies of water powered mills to crush corn and press oil from beans. The eastern half of Chappaqua was very suitable for farming. The majority of the Quaker settlers of Chappaqua were farmers. The popular farming industry also helped give way to Chappaqua&#x27;s high milk production. Other popular industries from Chappaqua included shoes, hardware, vinegar, pickles, eyeglasses, and furniture. Many early homes and businesses were demolished in the 1904 Chappaqua tornado.

In 1846 when the New York and Harlem Railroad extended through Chappaqua, business became centered on the new train station. These businesses included a hotel, livery stables, a public library, and various stores and small factories. The railroad enabled commuters to travel to New York City and back each day.

==Geography==
According to the 2020 U.S. census, Chappaqua has a total area of , all land. As delineated for the 2000 census, the CDP of Chappaqua covered a much greater area: , of which was land and , or 0.64%, was water.

Parts of the Chappaqua ZIP Code area are located in the towns of Mount Kisco, New Castle, Mount Pleasant, Yorktown, and Bedford, and the hamlet of Millwood. Parts of the Chappaqua Central School District include homes in other zip codes, such as 10570, the Pleasantville zip code.

Chappaqua is accessible from the Saw Mill River Parkway, which runs through Westchester County.

=== Downtown Chappaqua ===
Chappaqua downtown is located along King Street and South Greeley Avenue. It includes many commercial buildings such as Pizza Station, Little Thai Kitchen, a Bank of America office, and various local hardware shops. South Greeley Avenue is also home to Robert E. Bell Middle school, the Chappaqua Library, and the local police station.

==Demographics==


As of the 2010 census, following a major revision to the delineation of its boundaries by the Census Bureau, the population was 1,436. At the 2000 census, with very different census-defined boundaries, Chappaqua had a population of 9,468. Note the Chappaqua census-designated-place is different from the Hamlet of Chappaqua, which has a much higher population as part of the Town of New Castle.

As of the census of 2010, there were 1,434 people residing in Chappaqua. According to the 2015-2019 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, there are 595 housing units and the median household income is $250,000+. The racial makeup of the CDP was 76.1% White alone, 0% Black or African American alone, 0% Native American alone, 22.6% Asian alone, 0% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander alone, 0% some other race alone, and 1.3% from two or more races.

According to the 2010 census], the median age was 39 years, with 3.8% of the population under 5, 81.6% 18 and older, and 10% 65 and older. Males had a median income of $207,083 versus $128,750 for females. 0% of families were below the poverty line. 6.6% of people old enough had a high school or equivalent degree of education, 5.8 had some college but no degree, 4% had an associate degree, 37.3% had a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and 46.3% had a graduate or professional degree.

Nationwide, Chappaqua ranks 42nd among the 100 highest-income places in the United States (with at least 1,000 households). In 2008, CNNMoney listed Chappaqua fifth in their list of &quot;25 top-earning towns.&quot; Chappaqua 2007 estimated median household income was $198,000.

===Crime===
Although Chappaqua&#x27;s crime rate is far below the national average, the area has had a few high-profile murders. In 1996, a battle between a lottery winner and his former lover over custody of their 5-year-old child resulted in a gun battle; the winner was acquitted of the murder of his former lover on the basis of self-defense, and convicted of the shooting of the woman&#x27;s father. In November 2006 a disbarred attorney drove the body of his severely injured wife to Northern Westchester Hospital, claiming that the couple had been ambushed and shot in the nearby town of Millwood. She died soon after. For over a year, police expressed skepticism about the husband&#x27;s account and did not rule him out as a suspect. In December 2007 the man was charged with his wife&#x27;s murder after trying to collect on life insurance policies. Carlos Perez-Olivo was convicted October 4, 2008 for the murder of his wife, Peggy Perez-Olivo, who had been working as a teaching assistant at Douglas Grafflin Elementary School in Chappaqua.

=== History of Chappaqua schools ===
Small, one-room schoolhouses devoid of windows were prevalent in the 1800s. In the Chappaqua region, there were eight such schoolhouses. These small schools prevailed until around 1870, when the Quakers built a large school called the Chappaqua Mountain Institute on Quaker Street. In the year 1885 the school caught fire, and much refurbishing was done, with the addition of two new wings. It was sold in 1908 and the school&#x27;s property is now owned by Children&#x27;s Aid.

==Utilities==
===Emergency services===
Emergency medical services and fire protection are provided by volunteer agencies. The Chappaqua Volunteer Ambulance Corps provides basic life support services to most of New Castle, including Chappaqua. Paramedic service is provided by Westchester EMS, a non-profit provider. The hamlet is protected by the New Castle Police Department, which also provides first-response services for medical emergencies. The volunteer-based Chappaqua Fire Department, established in 1910, provides firefighting services to the hamlet of Chappaqua. The fire department currently maintains two firehouses in Chappaqua.

<text>Croton-on-Hudson ( ) is a village in Westchester County, New York, United States. The population was 8,327 at the 2020 United States census over 8,070 at the 2010 census. It is located in the town of Cortlandt as part of New York City&#x27;s northern suburbs. The village was incorporated in 1898.

==History==
Humans have lived in the area that would become Croton-on-Hudson since at least 7000 BC. The Kitchawanc tribe, part of the Wappinger Confederacy of the Algonquian peoples, signed a peace treaty with the newly arriving Dutch people at Croton Point in 1645, now commemorated by a plaque in the park there.

Stephanus van Cortlandt began acquiring land in the area to build a manor in 1677, the same year he became mayor of New York City. It was granted by royal patent in 1697 as the Manor of Cortlandt, including the area known as Croton Landing where the Croton River meets the Hudson River, where the manor house was built. A 1718 census reported 91 inhabitants, including Dutch settlers and English Quakers. People worked the manor primarily as farmers or millers.

In the mid- to late 1800s first the Croton Dam, then the New Croton Dam, and the Croton Aqueduct were built on the Croton River to supply New York City, along with the New York Central Railroad station on the Hudson River. Many Irish, Italian and German immigrants moved to the area to work on those projects, increasing the population dramatically. By 1898, when the Village incorporated, the population was 1,000 people, growing to 1,700 people in the early 1900s.

In 1846, work began on a Hudson River rail line from Poughkeepsie to New York City. Clifford Harmon, a realtor, purchased 550 acres of land next to the village of Croton in 1903. He gave part of the land to the New York Central Railroad to build a train station, on the condition that the station would forever be named after him. Today it is called the Croton-Harmon station of the Metro-North Railroad and of Amtrak. In 1906, the station became a major service facility for the railroad. The station expanded even further in 1913, when it became the stop at which electric trains from New York City switched to steam engines. The station still serves this purpose, but for diesel locomotives instead of steam engines.

Harmon thrived as an artist&#x27;s colony alongside the village, while the neighboring Mount Airy community evolved from Quakers to Greenwich Village artists and writers by the early 1900s. Mount Airy was home to many early members of the American Communist Party. In 1932 Harmon and most of Mount Airy were incorporated into the village.

== Economy ==
Croton-on-Hudson&#x27;s economy has historically thrived on the Metro-North train station that up until the early 1980s served as the point at which northbound trains would exchange their electric engines for other modes of conveyance. During those days, the train station and its super-adjacent area was known as Harmon. Because maintenance of diesel and steam engines was then very labor-intensive, there were many workers whose needs were served by abundant service businesses, such as restaurants and bars. Because of the separate development of both the Harmon and the Mt. Airy communities, there were originally two commercial districts—one centered on Grand Street, and the other in Harmon—though in recent years the two have merged into a single sprawling commercial district. There is also a North Riverside commercial district serving communities along Riverside Drive, Brook Street, Grand Street, and Bank Street.
After the New York Central Railroad folded into Penn Central in 1968, Croton-on-Hudson&#x27;s economy slowly stagnated. Although Croton-Harmon station still served as the main transfer point northbound between local and express trains, the laborers who had earlier fueled a bustling service economy were no longer present in Harmon. The exodus of labor during the early 1970s was compounded by the stagflation that was a result of higher oil prices and skyrocketing interest rates.

There has been an ongoing effort since the early 1990s to develop the riverfront for recreational use. Among the accomplishments are a pedestrian bridge spanning U.S. Route 9 and NY 9A between the lower village and Senasqua Park, the Crossining pedestrian footbridge across the Croton River, the bicycle trail extensions around Half Moon Bay Condominiums, rehabilitation of the &quot;Picture Tunnel&quot; (repaving and closing it to cars), and acquisition and clearing of the Croton Landing property. In addition, Croton Point Park is also along the riverfront.

==Transportation==
The town is a stop for Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Empire Service&quot;, &quot;Adirondack&quot;, &quot;Maple Leaf&quot;, &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot;, and &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; routes, as well the MTA&#x27;s Metro-North Hudson Line service, both at the Croton-Harmon station. Metro-North&#x27;s main shops and yards are also located here.

Croton-on-Hudson is served by US 9, NY 9A, and NY 129.

== Culture ==
Croton Point Park hosted Clearwater&#x27;s Great Hudson River Revival, a yearly folk music, art and environmental festival.

Croton-on-Hudson has an annual event called the Summerfest. Every year the central business district (with corners at the municipal building, Grand Street fire house and Croton-Harmon High School) is closed to automobile traffic for music, American food, local fund raisers, traveling, and local artists. 

Since 1981 Croton-on-Hudson has been the home of the annual Harry Chapin Run Against Hunger, a 10k race and Fun Run, held on a Sunday afternoon in October.

Every weekend in October, people visit Van Cortlandt Manor to see the Blaze. Started in 2005, the Blaze consists of thousands of pumpkins which are hollowed out by volunteers but carved by a creative team.

The Asbury United Methodist Church and Bethel Chapel and Cemetery, Croton North Railroad Station, and St. Augustine&#x27;s Episcopal Church Complex are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Van Cortlandt Manor is listed as a National Historic Landmark.

From the 1910s to the 1960s, Croton was a popular location for the summer homes of American communists, socialists and other radicals and many important artists and writers. This gave the Mt. Airy area in Croton the nickname &quot;Red Hill&quot;

Croton-on-Hudson is the original home of the Hudson Institute, a key Cold War think tank where the &quot;Mutual Assured Destruction&quot; strategy for nuclear war deterrence was developed.

The village is home to one of a handful operating &quot;dummy lights&quot; in the United States, located downtown at the intersection of Old Post Road South and Grand Street. It is a traffic signal on a pedestal which sits in the middle of an intersection, dating back to the 1920s. Another active dummy light located in New York State is at Beacon. The one in Canajoharie was removed in 2021.

<text>Dobbs Ferry is a village in Westchester County, New York, United States. The population was 10,875 according to the 2010 United States Census. In 2021, its population rose to an estimated 11,456. The village of Dobbs Ferry is located in, and is a part of, the town of Greenburgh. The village ZIP Code is 10522. Most of the village falls within the boundaries of the Dobbs Ferry Union Free School District.

Dobbs Ferry was ranked seventh in the list of the top 10 places to live in New York State for 2014, according to the national online real estate brokerage Movoto. Dobbs Ferry is also the first village in New York State certified as a Climate Smart Community and was granted in 2014 the highest level given out in the state.

==History==
Multiple groups of Native Americans lived around what is now known as Dobbs Ferry since at least 4500 BC. The most recent tribe who claimed territory of the area are the Wecquaesgeek, maintaining villages until the 1600s. Numerous artifacts from the tribe continue to be found along Wicker&#x27;s Creek in oyster middens.

Dobbs Ferry was named for the ferry service started in the early 1700s by John Dobbs or his son William. It was not a licensed service, so there are no official records to pin down exactly which Dobbs family member started the service or when. John was English, son of Walter Dobbs who can be found in the historical record getting a liquor license in Manhattan in 1680, leasing land on the East River to harvest salt marsh hay soon after, and serving as a constable in the Bowery Ward. John grew up in Manhattan, the nephew of the wealthy and politically prominent William Merritt, a mariner and businessman. Merritt was mayor of New York from 1695 to 1698 and co-founded Trinity Church (Anglican, now Episcopalian).

John leased the waterfront and adjoining acreage at present-day Dobbs Ferry from Frederick Phillips in 1698, when he was about 23 and single. Simultaneously his uncle William Merritt moved to a large parcel he co-owned on the opposite bank, at what was later called Snedens Landing (now Palisades, NY). It was a natural place for a ferry since it was the first spot going north from the city where the west bank was not blocked by the sheer rock cliff known as The Palisades. Merritt needed to get out of the city, because he had been an anti-Leislerite, allied with those who engineered Jacob Leisler&#x27;s trial and hanging in 1691 and therefore faced a perilous future in the city when a pro-Leislerite royal governor was sent over in 1698. (An anti-Leislerite ally who stayed in the city was arrested, charged with treason and sentenced to death by the re-ascendant Leislerites, though the sentence was not carried out.)

With members of the Dobbs/Merritt clan living on both sides of the river, the ferry service probably evolved as an adjunct to intra-family crossings of the river. By 1739 ownership of the ferry service passed to Robert and Mary (&quot;Mollie) Sneden who first rented and then bought a portion of Merritt&#x27;s former holdings. Mary is believed by some to have been John&#x27;s daughter Mary Dobbs. There is no proof of this, but Mary&#x27;s Christening was recorded at Sleepy Hollow Church and the date matches Mary Sneden&#x27;s birth year. Moreover, there is no alternative adulthood recorded for Mary Dobbs and no alternative childhood for Mary Sneden.

The ferry service continued until about 1943. Members of the Sneden and Dobbs families were involved almost throughout, including all of the 19th century and parts of the 20th century. There is a conflicting version of this history that is widely disseminated, which gives a prominent role to one Jeremiah Dobbs, but this has been debunked by recent careful research. There was a Jeremiah Dobbs among John&#x27;s descendants, but there is no evidence he played any important role in the ferry.

Dobbs Ferry played a vital role in the American Revolutionary War. The position of the village opposite the northernmost end of the Palisades gave it importance during the war. The region was repeatedly raided by camp followers of each army; the British army made Dobbs Ferry a &quot;rendezvous&quot;, after the Battle of White Plains in November 1776, and the continental division under General Benjamin Lincoln was here at the end of January 1777.

Mary Sneden and all but one of her sons were Tories (Robert Sneden Senior died before the war). Patriots on the west bank ordered the Tory Snedens to cease their involvement with the ferry because they were aiding the British cause. One son, Robert Sneden, sided with the rebels and so operation and eventually ownership of the ferry fell to him.

In July and August 1781, during the seventh year of the war, Continental Army troops commanded by General George Washington were encamped in Dobbs Ferry and neighboring localities, alongside allied French forces under the command of the Comte de Rochambeau. earthworks and a fort, commanding the Hudson ferry, were built by the American side. A large British army controlled Manhattan at the time, and Washington chose the Dobbs Ferry area for encampment because he hoped to probe for weaknesses in the British defenses, just to the south. But on August 14, 1781, a communication was received from French Admiral Comte de Grasse in the West Indies, which caused Washington to change his strategy. De Grasse&#x27;s communication, which advocated a joint land and sea attack against the British in Virginia, convinced Washington to risk a march of more than to the Chesapeake region of Virginia. Washington&#x27;s new strategy, adopted and designed in mid-August 1781, at the encampment of the allied armies, would win the war. The allied armies were ordered to break camp on August 19, 1781: on that date the Americans took the first steps of their march to Virginia along present-day Ashford Avenue and Broadway, en route to victory over General Cornwallis at the Siege of Yorktown and to victory in the Revolutionary War.

The village was originally incorporated in 1873 as Greenburgh, but the name was changed to Dobbs Ferry in 1882.

The current local government of Dobbs Ferry is headed by Mayor Vincent Rossillo, a Democrat, who was elected in November 2019.

The Estherwood and Carriage House, Hyatt-Livingston House, South Presbyterian Church, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

Dobbs Ferry is located at (41.012729, −73.866026).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and , or 23.03%, is water.

The village is bounded on the west by the Hudson River, and on the east by the Saw Mill River. Wickers Creek (name derived from the indigenous Weckquaesgeek) runs east to west through the center of the village from its main source in the Juhring Nature Preserve, Todd&#x27;s Pond.

The village consists of a series of neighborhoods as defined in the 2010 Vision Plan, the Master Plan for the village. These neighborhoods are not popularly recognized as of 2014. As the Vision Plan states, &quot;Sometimes the boundaries of these neighborhoods are clearly defined, but other times less so. Where necessary, boundaries have been interpolated.&quot; The neighborhoods are: Springhurst Park, Broadway, Wickers Creek, Waterfront, Old Town, Fairmead, Riverview Manor, Villard, Osborne, Belden, Maple, Walgrove, Virginia, Beacon Hill, Campuses and Woods, Parkway, Southfield, Knoll, Northfield, and Juhring. (Homes in Juhring are commonly referred to by real estate brokers as part of the Ardsley Park neighborhood, which encompasses the Juhring neighborhood in Dobbs Ferry and the Ardsley-on-Hudson neighborhood of Irvington, New York).

==Climate==
==Education==

A majority of the village is within the Dobbs Ferry Union Free School District, which consists of Springhurst Elementary, grades K–5, Dobbs Ferry Middle School, grades 6–8, and the Dobbs Ferry High School, grades 9–12.

Other parts of Dobbs Ferry are in Ardsley Union Free School District.

Mercy University, a private institution with undergraduate and graduate programs, has its main campus in Dobbs Ferry. Our Lady of Victory Academy, a local parochial school offering grades 9–12 for girls, was located on the campus of Mercy College until its closing in 2011.

The Masters School is a private school located south of the town center that offers grades 5–12 for boys and girls. It is a boarding or day school that was founded in 1877 by Eliza Masters. The school contains a mansion called Estherwood.

An Alcott Montessori School is located in the town.

==Public transit==
Almost 10% of households do not own a car and rely on public transit, bicycling, and walking.

Several lines of the Bee-Line Bus System run through Dobbs Ferry, facilitating north-south travel along the Broadway/Route 9 corridor and east-west along Ashford Avenue. The village operates a shuttle bus from the train station in the afternoon and evenings.

Commuter rail service to Grand Central Terminal is available via the Dobbs Ferry station, served by Metro-North Railroad. The train runs on the Hudson Line, and travel time from Dobbs Ferry to Grand Central Terminal is approximately 37 minutes on an express train and 43 minutes on a local train. Many Metro North riders connect to the New York City Subway&#x27;s at Marble Hill to reach destinations on the west side of Manhattan, or at Harlem–125th Street station for the Upper East Side.

Amtrak inter-city rail trains travel on the Hudson Line tracks, but trains do not stop in the village. The closest Amtrak stations are Yonkers and Croton–Harmon stations.

==Culture==
In 2018 Brooke Lea Foster of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that it was one of several &quot;Rivertowns&quot; in New York State, which she described as among the &quot;least suburban of suburbs, each one celebrated by buyers there for its culture and hip factor, as much as the housing stock and sophisticated post-city life.&quot; Of those, Foster stated that Dobbs Ferry had the most ethnic/cultural diversity.

=== Parks and recreation ===
The village&#x27;s Recreation Department runs a variety of programs out of the Embassy Community Center, including art and dance classes, sports leagues, summer camp, and other activities open to the public. Programs for older adults are also well-funded and used. Additional sports leagues for baseball and soccer are run independently but use village facilities.

There are a variety of village public parks, in order of size:
* Juhring Nature Preserve, a 76-acre wooded park with trail entrances from the Ardsley Park (Juhring), Northfield, and Knoll neighborhoods in Dobbs Ferry.
* Waterfront Park on the Hudson River shoreline with playground, soccer field, and open space. It serves as the site of the Dobbs Ferry Union Free School District graduation ceremony, summer concerts, and Independence Day fireworks.
* Gould Park, a gift of wealthy resident Jay Gould, in the center of the Village, with a public swimming pool, playground, basketball court, and multi-sport ballfields.
* Memorial Park has a wading pool, baseball field, basketball court, and bocce court. In 2014, the American Legion Post 148, which leased space in the park, collapsed and was razed.
* Chauncey Park along the Saw Mill River

Two linear parks used for active transportation and recreation traverse Dobbs Ferry as well. The Old Croton Aqueduct Trailway, a linear State Park, runs north-south through the village on its western side. The South County Trailway, a linear Westchester County park also runs north-south through the village, but on its eastern side along the bank of the Saw Mill River. There are also segments of trails unconnected to each other, including the Gateway Trail near Estherwood Avenue and Spoiler&#x27;s Run near Belden Avenue.

==Emergency services==

Dobbs Ferry is served by a paid police department, a volunteer fire department (housing three pumpers and one tower ladder in two firehouses) and a volunteer ambulance corps (possessing two ambulances (one equipped with four-wheel-drive) and a fire rehab unit). As a part of the Town of Greenburgh, the village is eligible for additional coverage from the town services. Mutual aid agreements exist with neighboring municipalities for further coverage.

<text>Elmsford is a village in Westchester County, New York, United States. It is part of the New York metropolitan area. Roughly one square mile, the village is fully contained within the borders of the town of Greenburgh. As of the 2010 census, the population of Elmsford was 4,664.

==History==

Elmsford was largely farmland throughout its early history. The construction of railroads in the late 19th century brought new prominence to the area, and in 1910 it was incorporated as a village.

The area was known from colonial times as &quot;Storm&#x27;s Bridge&quot; and later, &quot;Hall&#x27;s Corners&quot;, names derived from the principal landowners of the times. In 1870, the growing village was officially renamed &quot;Elmsford&quot; in honor of a local landmark, a giant elm tree (since deceased). The names Elmsford and Storm&#x27;s Bridge are reminders of the nearby Saw Mill River, which once had significant tributaries flowing through the village.

A longstanding legend holds that Elmsford is the birthplace of the term &quot;cocktail&quot;. According to the tale, a local colonial tavern (sometimes said to be established by town father Isaac Storm) had run out of wooden stirrers during the war and started using the quills of roosters&#x27; tailfeathers to stir their drinks; a more embellished version holds that the roosters were plundered from nearby Tory farmers.

Much of Elmsford developed around the New York and Putnam Railroad station, with train service beginning in the 1870s. Commuter rail service ended in 1958, and freight service ended in 1975. The railroad bed is now the South County Trailway and North County Trailway. The train station building is now a restaurant.

The Elmsford Reformed Church and Cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

==Geography==
Elmsford is located at (41.053963, -73.815711) in Westchester County, NY. According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

==Government==
Elmsford&#x27;s government comprises a mayor and four trustees. The board and mayor also employ a professional village manager.

Current Mayor: Robert Williams

==Fire Department==

The Village of Elmsford is protected by the all-volunteer Elmsford Fire Department, which consists of two fire companies each occupying their own firehouses, Live Oak Engine Company, operating two fire engines, and Elmsford Fire Company #1, operating a quint and a tower ladder. Emergency Medical Services are provided by the village-operated Elmsford EMS, which provides BLS services, and the Town of Greenburgh EMS which provides ALS-paramedic service when requested.

===Fire station locations and apparatus===
==Police Department==
The Elmsford Police Department, created with the incorporation of the village in 1910, is currently located in the same building as Village Hall, and provides round the clock police protection to the village. It currently employs 22 sworn personnel.

==Transportation==
The village was once served by the New York and Putnam Railroad. Passenger service ceased in 1958. The Elmsford train station, located on Saw Mill River Road (near the intersection with Route 119) is still standing and now houses a restaurant. The closest Metro-North Railroad stations are Tarrytown (on the Hudson Line) to the west and White Plains (on the Harlem Line) to the east.

Several routes of the Bee-Line Bus System pass through the village.

==Features==
Elmsford&#x27;s road system connects to numerous major highways and thoroughfares, including Interstate 287, the Saw Mill River Parkway, the Sprain Brook Parkway and Route 9A; the North County Trailway and South County Trailway bicycle paths terminate there. Convenient to White Plains, Yonkers, New York City, and Connecticut, the village is a significant center of commercial traffic and distribution. It is home to the large Local 456 of the Teamsters union.

The village&#x27;s public schools are run by the Elmsford Board of Education and include Dixson Primary, Alice E. Grady Elementary and Alexander Hamilton Junior/Senior High School. The village is also home to the private Roman Catholic elementary school Our Lady of Mount Carmel, which is affiliated with the Catholic parish of the same name and which was established in 1929.

Dedicated in 1996, Carol Nichols Park has facilities for softball, basketball, tennis as well as a gated &quot;kiddie park&quot; and Sprinkler Park (attendant) for small children.

The town has had an animal shelter since the 1930s. In 1995 the shelter, Central Westchester Humane Society, moved to a location on Warehouse Lane South. The shelter was replaced by Pets Alive Westchester, and later Paws Crossed Animal Rescue, the current owner.

The Westchester Broadway Theater was a professional dinner theater venue established in Elmsford in 1974. The theater closed permanently in October 2020 due to financial hardships caused by the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic.

==History==
According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Colonial geographers and surveyors identified a crossing over the Croton River in the Goldens Bridge area as early as 1750. The early maps refer to the bridge by different names, including Coldens Bridge, Goldings Bridge and Goldens Bridge. The bridge was washed away and rebuilt a number of times as the area around the crossing began to grow into a depot for farm produce from Connecticut and Salem and a stop for travelers along the river. But there is no trace of the bridge today as it lies under the Croton Reservoir, which was created when the Croton River was dammed around the turn of the 20th century.&quot;

In the mid-20th century, the hamlet was home to a majority Jewish community, which governed itself under communal living standards, with many residents considering the community to be the true owner of the land their homes were built upon. Bridge L-158, a railroad bridge, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

<doc id="127561" wikidata="Q8965042" url="?curid=127561" title="Edgemont, New York">
<text>Greenville, commonly known as Edgemont, is a census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Greenburgh in Westchester County, New York, United States. The population was 9,394 at the 2020 census. Most of its residents refer to the area as Edgemont, which is also the name of its school district.

It is an inner suburb of New York City, lying north of Columbus Circle. It is a partial bedroom community, with some of its residents working in Midtown Manhattan. Other workplaces of Greenville residents are in the offices and factories of White Plains, Yonkers, the Bronx, Rockland County, New York, or Stamford, Connecticut, as well as many businesses and hospitals in southern Westchester County. The hamlet was originally ethnic Jewish and Italian but is now ethnically diverse. Its main street is Central Park Avenue. It&#x27;s populated with strip malls, gas stations and outlet stores and caters mainly to shoppers from Yonkers and The Bronx.

The limits of the CDP are essentially defined by the areas served by the Edgemont Union Free School District and the Greenville Fire Department, whose areas slightly differ.

Greenville was originally a development designed by different architects for summer homes for Manhattanites. With its antique colonial homes and outstanding schools, it is an option for those seeking to move from New York City. Metro-North trains are accessible via the Scarsdale and Hartsdale train stations, and they run 25–55 minutes to Grand Central Terminal, depending on if one has an express or local train.

In March 2018, Bloomberg ranked Greenville as the 22nd wealthiest place in the United States, and the third wealthiest in New York.

==Postal address==
Greenville comprises two ZIP codes: 10583 (Scarsdale, New York) and 10530 (Hartsdale, New York). Both ZIP codes encompass significant areas outside of Greenville as well. While the bulk of Greenville lies within the Scarsdale zip code, none of Greenville is part of the village of Scarsdale. According to a local real estate broker, &quot;Edgemont is smaller and more intimate than Scarsdale&quot;. Essentially, Greenville is an unincorporated CDP within Greenburgh, New York, but with a Scarsdale, New York or Hartsdale, New York mailing address depending on where in the CDP someone is.

==Schools==
Greenville is known for its public schools, served by the Edgemont Union Free School District. This district consists of three schools: Edgemont Junior/Senior High School, Greenville Elementary School, and Seely Place Elementary School. Each elementary school has students from kindergarten through 6th grade. Edgemont Junior/Senior High School, which sits on an campus, contains students from grades 7 through 12.

In the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; 2018 ranking of public schools, Edgemont was ranked 14th in New York State and 87th nationwide. In &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2007 ranking of public high schools, Edgemont was ranked first in Westchester County and 41st nationwide. Similarly, in &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s 2006 public high school listings, Edgemont was ranked second in Westchester County and 56th nationwide. The magazine&#x27;s 2005 listings ranked Edgemont first in Westchester County and 26th in the nation. Similarly, in &quot;Westchester Magazine&#x27;s&quot; 2005 rankings of public schools (the most recent time the magazine ranked schools on any criteria other than income), Edgemont was ranked first among 44 public schools in the county. In 1999, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; named Edgemont as one of its &quot;examples of excellence&quot; for a suburban public school.

==Incorporation==
In 2016, a group of residents began circulating a petition to incorporate the Greenville Fire District into the Village of Edgemont and developed a website informing residents of the impacts and opportunities of such a change. In February 2017, it was filed with the Town for certification so that the residents may vote in a referendum. Town Supervisor Paul Feiner rejected the petition, but the petitioners sued the Town and the State Supreme Court overturned the Supervisor&#x27;s decision and ordered the election. The Supervisor appealed the State Supreme Court&#x27;s decision.

==Geography==
Greenville is located at (40.998977, -73.820147), in the southeastern corner of the town of Greenburgh.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.34% is water.

==Transportation==
The main highway to Edgemont is the Sprain Brook Parkway, which is accessed at the Jackson Avenue exit at the Edgemont-Yonkers border. The parkway is the western border of Edgemont. Some residents prefer to utilize the Bronx River Parkway, located along the eastern border of Edgemont. The main north–south road through Edgemont is Central Park Avenue, often referred to as Central Avenue by residents. Central Avenue is part of New York State Route 100. This road extends from Yonkers in the south to Somers in the north, by way of White Plains. There are four major east–west roads through Edgemont, notably Jackson Avenue, Ardsley Road, Mount Joy Avenue, and Underhill/Old Army Road. Ardsley Road experiences many backups through Edgemont into the village of Scarsdale, due to it being the primary east–west road between the eastern and western reaches of Westchester County in the gap between Interstate 287 and the Cross County Parkway.

Many residents commute to New York City on the Metro-North Railroad, using either the Scarsdale or Hartsdale station. Some residents can walk or take the Bee-Line Bus #65 to Scarsdale station, although parking tends to be more readily available at the Hartsdale station. Central Avenue also has an express bus running to 5th Avenue in Manhattan, but this takes considerably longer than the Metro-North due to traffic on the Major Deegan Expressway. Bee Line Bus route 20/21 runs from the NYC subway in the Bronx north to White Plains, and route 66 runs across Ardsley Road from the village of Dobbs Ferry to the city of New Rochelle.

<text>Hartsdale is a hamlet located in the town of Greenburgh, Westchester County, New York, United States. The population was 5,293 at the 2010 census. It is a suburb of New York City.

==History==
Hartsdale, a CDP/hamlet/post-office in the town of Greenburgh, New York, lies on the Bronx River north of New York City. It is served by the Metro-North Harlem River commuter rail line into Grand Central Terminal. Hartsdale is the home of America&#x27;s first canine pet cemetery (started by veterinarian Samuel Johnson in 1896), and the world&#x27;s first Carvel Ice Cream store (1934), which closed in 2008.

===Pre-Colonial Period===
Hartsdale&#x27;s earliest settlers were the Wecquaesgeek (sometimes spelled Weckquaesgeek), a band of the Wappinger people, an Algonquian tribe that lived in southeastern New York from northern Westchester down through Manhattan. &quot;Weekquaeskeek&quot; is an Algonquian term believed to mean &quot;place of the bark kettle&quot;; a representation of this kettle appears in the Greenburgh town seal.

===Colonial Era and American Revolution===
After the earliest British settlers arrived, the area was developed under the manor system when Frederick Philipse, a Dutch merchant and British Loyalist, was granted the land by the British government. As lord of his Philipse Manor, he leased his land to tenant farmers who for a time lived alongside their Native American neighbors.

There is evidence to show that Hartsdale played a significant role during the American Revolution, some of which still stands today. On October 28, 1776, a battle was fought alongside the Bronx River, near the site of the current Hartsdale train station. The Odell House (on Ridge Road, built in 1732) served as the headquarters for the French general the Comte de Rochambeau, and is where the count and George Washington are supposed to have formed an alliance leading to the Battle of Yorktown. The house was later named after John Odell, Washington&#x27;s guide, who bought the property in 1785. In 1965, his descendants deeded it to the Sons of the American Revolution, which today stands in severe decay, awaiting funds to transform it into a museum.

After the Continental Army&#x27;s triumph, Tory sympathizer Frederick Philipse III (third lord of the manor and great-grandson to Frederick Philipse I) fled, his land was confiscated, and auctioned to the remaining tenants, many of whom were descendants of the Hart family. The intersection of Central Park Avenue and Hartsdale Avenue was named &quot;Hart&#x27;s Corners&quot; after Robert Hart, one of those farmers, and by the mid-19th century the entire area became known as &quot;Hartsdale&quot;.

===19th Century===
The area remained largely agrarian until 1865, when Eleazar Hart deeded land for the development of the New York and Harlem Railroad line into Manhattan, setting the stage for Hartsdale&#x27;s change into a more cosmopolitan commuter village. Between 1880 and 1940, large tracts of farmland and estates were subdivided and converted into private houses and apartments at a furious pace. By the 1960s, almost no remaining farmland was left for sale.

===20th Century===
In 1904, the successful German-Jewish banker Felix M. Warburg (1871–1937) purchased large tracts of land to build his &quot;Woodlands&quot; estate in Hartsdale, a summer home next to the country club where he and his wife Frieda Schiff Warburg (1876–1958) spent considerable time. The estate would later become an important site in the history of modern American ballet, when in 1934, their son Edward M. M. Warburg (1908–1992) helped produce George Balanchine&#x27;s &quot;Serenade&quot;, his first full-length ballet in America. In keeping with the family&#x27;s philanthropic efforts, Frieda Schiff Warburg, on her death in 1958, bequeathed a remaining to the town of Greenburgh to build a public school. This parcel is now the home of the Greenburgh Central School District (formerly called Greenburgh Central 7 School District) and Woodlands High School. The main Warburg mansion currently serves as the school district headquarters, but other remnants from the original estate grounds can still be seen standing in the surrounding woods and neighboring streets.

In 1932, Henry Jacques Gaisman, inventor and founder of the Gillette safety razor blade, purchased of land along Ridge Road, most of which he purchased from George A. C. Christiancy, son of the former U.S. minister to Peru, Isaac Peckham Christiancy. In 1952, at age 82, Gaisman married his nurse Catherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Vance Gaisman, aged 33, a former Catholic nun. In 1957, he and his wife Catherine (Mrs. Henry J. Gaisman) passed the title for his land to the New York Archdiocese for $600,000, with the agreement that they could live there as long as they wished. Mr. Gaisman died in 1974 at age 104, and Mrs. Gaisman remained on the estate until she moved to Connecticut in 1995. In 1999, the estate was saved from sale and development when the Town of Greenburgh acquired the property and reopened it as the Hart&#x27;s Brook Nature Preserve. Part of the agreement included the preservation of some portion of the estate as a home for retired Catholic nuns. Today the Catherine and Henry J. Gaisman Foundation continues to donate large amounts of money to support medical research.

On a hot Memorial Day weekend in 1934, Greek immigrant and ice cream salesman Tom Carvelas was selling ice cream from his truck around roads in Westchester when he broke down with a flat tire on the southbound side of Central Avenue (just south of the &quot;Four Corners&quot; section of Hartsdale). With his inventory melting rapidly, he decided to simply sell it off right there. Successful, he bought the land there, and in 1936 opened up the world&#x27;s first Carvel ice cream store. It stood there until 2008, when it was closed and the land sold to developers. To commemorate the birth of Carvel ice cream in Hartsdale, the Hartsdale Fire Company distributes Carvel &quot;Flying Saucers&quot; from Fire Station 1 after every Memorial Day parade.

==Geography==

Hartsdale is one of the few communities immediately surrounding New York City that still has two working farms, both on Secor Road. It also has several parks, including the Secor Woods Park, the Ridge Road Park, and Rumbrook Park.

The town can generally be subdivided into several areas, including the &quot;Village&quot; or downtown part (East Hartsdale Avenue), Manor Woods, Windsor Park, Poet&#x27;s Corner, Ridge Road, Orchard Hill, College Corners, or more specifically one of the several condominium developments built since the 1970s. Over the years, the town has attracted many different ethnic groups, and the downtown village has a significant Japanese population with Japanese shops, restaurants, real-estate brokers, and even a Japanese supermarket all within walking distance of East Hartsdale Avenue.

Ferncliff Cemetery is located on Secor Road in Hartsdale, famous as the burial grounds for many celebrities, including Aaliyah, Malcolm X, Heavy D, Judy Garland, Jerome Kern, Joan Crawford, Basil Rathbone, Ed Sullivan, Jam-Master Jay, James Baldwin, Michel Fokine, Tom Carvel, Oscar Hammerstein, Thelonious Monk, Paul Robeson, Minnesota Timberwolves Guard Malik Sealy, soprano Arleen Auger, and others. British rocker John Lennon, U.S. Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, and Muppets creator Jim Henson were cremated there. Composer Béla Bartók was initially buried in Hartsdale before being reinterred in his native Hungary in 1988. Radio DJ Alan Freed was also initially interred in Hartsdale until his ashes were moved to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.

The Hartsdale Railroad Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011, as was the Evangeline Booth House in Hartsdale hamlet.

<doc id="127563" wikidata="Q3248527" url="?curid=127563" title="Hastings-on-Hudson, New York">
<text>Hastings-on-Hudson is a village in Westchester County located in the southwestern part of the town of Greenburgh in the state of New York, United States. It is a suburb of New York City, located approximately north of midtown Manhattan, and is served by a stop on the Metro-North Hudson Line. To the north of Hastings-on-Hudson is the village of Dobbs Ferry, to the south, the city of Yonkers, and to the east unincorporated parts of Greenburgh. As of the 2020 US Census, it had a population of 8,590. The town lies on U.S. Route 9, &quot;Broadway&quot; and the Saw Mill River Parkway.

==History==
The area that is now Hastings-on-Hudson and Dobbs Ferry was the primary settlement of the Weckquaesgeek Algonquian people, who called the community Wysquaqua. In the summer, the Weckquaesgeeks camped at the mouth of the ravine running under the present Warburton Avenue Bridge. There they fished, swam and collected oysters and clamshells used to make wampum. On the level plain nearby (which is now Maple Avenue), they planted corn and possibly tobacco.

The findings of large numbers of artifacts have suggested that there was significant tribal activity in the confluence of Factory Brook and Scheckler&#x27;s Brook just behind what is now the Cropsey Studio, but the interest in the site failed to generate any archeological inquiry.

===Pre-1920===
Around 1650, a Dutch carpenter, named Frederick Philipse, arrived in New Amsterdam. In 1682, Philipse traded with the Native Americans for the area that is now Dobbs Ferry and Hastings-on-Hudson. In 1693, the English Crown granted Philipse the Manor of Philipsburg, which included what is now Hastings-on-Hudson. After dividing the area into four nearly equal-sized farms, the Philipses leased them to Dutch, English and French Huguenot settlers.

During the American Revolution, what is now Hastings-on-Hudson, lay between the lines of the warring forces and was declared neutral territory. In reality, the area became a no-man&#x27;s land and was raided repeatedly by both sides. The minor Revolutionary War skirmish known as the Battle of Edgar&#x27;s Lane was fought in Hastings. Following the Revolution, the Philipses, who had been loyal to George III, saw their vast lands confiscated and sold by the newly established American state. In 1785, the four farms comprising today&#x27;s Hastings-on-Hudson were bought by James DeClark, Jacobus Dyckman, George Fisher, and tavern keeper Peter Post.

Around the same time, Westchester County, which had been established as one of the 10 original counties in New York, was divided into towns, and the area that is now Hastings-on-Hudson became part of the town of Greenburgh. The village was incorporated in 1879 and its name changed from Hastings-Upon-Hudson to Hastings-on-Hudson.

Stone quarrying was the earliest industry in Hastings-on-Hudson. From 1865 to 1871, hundreds of Scottish and Irish laborers blasted huge quantities of dolomitic marble from a white Westchester marble quarry. An inclined railroad carried the marble down to the quarry wharf where it was dressed by skilled stonecutters and loaded onto ships bound for cities like New York and Charleston, South Carolina.

By the 1880s, Hastings Pavement was producing hexagonal paving blocks which were used extensively in Central Park and Prospect Park in Brooklyn. Between 1895 and 1900, Hastings Pavement produced 10 million such blocks and shipped them throughout the United States and to cities in Canada, Brazil and England. By 1891, the National Conduit and Cable Company had established an operation on the waterfront producing cables for utility companies here and abroad. In 1912, labor strife between striking workers and their employer, the National Cable and Conduit Company, left two striking workers and two bystanders dead. Similar labor unrest occurred in 1916, whereby the Village was put under house arrest.

During World War I, 200 National Guardsmen were stationed in Hastings-on-Hudson because of the security interests of the National Conduit plant and a chemical plant opened by Frederick G. Zinsser that produced a wood alcohol called Hastings Spirits.

The plant was important because in 1915 it took orders from the UK to produce .303 ammunition but they could not pump up the production, so the contract were cancelled in late 1916. In 1917 it produced .30-06 ammo for the US Navy and Army.

===1920–recent===
The Anaconda Copper Company took over National Conduit in 1929, and a few years later acquired the Hastings Pavement property. By the end of World War II, Anaconda owned most of the industrial waterfront. Anaconda closed its Hastings-on-Hudson plant in 1975, bringing to an end the century-long era of heavy industry on the Hastings-on-Hudson waterfront.

The 1926-founded Hillside-on-Hastings sanitarium and hospital opened in 1926. They relocated to Glen Oaks, Queens, in 1941.

Billie Burke, actress (the &quot;Good Witch&quot; in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;), lived in Hastings-on-Hudson and left her property to the school district, which still owns it, and uses it for various sports.

Benjamin Franklin Goodrich, from Ripley, in western New York, used real estate profits to purchase the Hudson River Rubber Company, a small business in Hastings-on-Hudson. The following year, Goodrich relocated the business to Akron, Ohio.

Children&#x27;s Village, a boarding facility for children in difficult circumstances, located in neighboring Dobbs Ferry, sold about of its property in Hastings-on-Hudson to a developer in 1986. The developer was planning to build close to 100 homes that would result in traffic on the roads adjoining Hillside Elementary School. Local residents formed a committee called &quot;Save Hillside Woods&quot; and raised close to $800K. As a result of the 1987 stock market crash and the subsequent receivership of the bank that held the mortgage on the property, the Village purchased this parcel from the FDIC with the funds accumulated and a bond floated by the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson to expand and maintain Hillside Woods.

The Jasper F. Cropsey House and Studio and Hastings Prototype House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The John William Draper House is listed as a National Historic Landmark

In 2013, the infusion of urban professionals from New York City resulted in characterization of the town as an example of &quot;hipsturbia&quot;, a neologism coined by &quot;The New York Times&quot; to describe the hip lifestyle as lived in suburbia by &quot;hipsters&quot;. However, this article has been the subject of much controversy both within and with-out the community, with &quot;The New York Observer&quot; publishing one particularly scathing commentary.

<text>Hawthorne is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) located in the town of Mount Pleasant in Westchester County, New York, United States. The population was 4,586 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The village was originally known as Hammond&#x27;s Mills, and was part of Frederick Philipse&#x27;s estate Philipsburgh. On September 23, 1780, Major John André stopped here on his way to New York to ask directions after meeting with Benedict Arnold.

After the Revolutionary War, the name of the village changed to Unionville. The hamlet&#x27;s population consisted mostly of farmers. The Reformed Church of Unionville (Hawthorne Reformed Church) was built here in 1818. In 1832, a one-room school house was built. In 1847, a railroad station was established on New York Central&#x27;s Harlem Division, with the name Unionville. A post office was established on February 10, 1851, and was designated Neperan after the Indian name for the Saw Mill River.

In the early 1890s, real-estate developer Louis Smadbeck began buying up the area farms to subdivide into parcels, which were sold to working- and middle-class people looking to live outside the city.

In 1901, Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, also known as Mother Mary Alphonsa, O.P., a convert to Catholicism and daughter of Nathaniel Hawthorne, founded Rosary Hill Home in Sherman Park (now Thornwood) for those suffering from incurable cancer. Mother Mary Alphonsa also founded a Dominican Order now known as the Dominican Sisters of Hawthorne. Shortly after the opening of the cancer home, the hamlet was renamed Hawthorne in Mother Mary Alphonsa&#x27;s honor. Rosary Hill Home is still operated by the Dominican Sisters of Hawthorne and is located on a hilltop on Linda Avenue.

Hawthorne is the final resting place of Babe Ruth, James Cagney, Billy Martin, Malachi Martin, Dorothy Kilgallen, Ernesto Lecuona and many other notables interred at Gate of Heaven Cemetery.

The Hammond House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

On July 12, 2006, an F2 tornado struck the hamlet, causing major damage to the California Closets Warehouse and minor injuries to three people. It was the strongest tornado to strike in Westchester County.

==Geography==
Hawthorne is located at (41.103664, -73.795807).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

Bounded by Route 9A to the west, the Taconic State Parkway to the east, and split in the middle by the Sprain Brook Parkway, Hawthorne lies near the geographic center of Westchester County.

Corporate parks and nurseries line Hawthorne&#x27;s Route 9A corridor. Commerce Street (Route 141), the main commercial thoroughfare serving both Hawthorne and Thornwood, runs north to south, parallel to Metro-North&#x27;s Harlem Line tracks. It is a 40-minute train ride from the Hawthorne station to Grand Central Terminal.

==Education==
Hawthorne&#x27;s residents are served by the Mount Pleasant Central School District, which includes the Hawthorne Elementary School, Columbus Elementary School, Westlake Middle School and Westlake High School (the latter three actually located in Thornwood).

The Jewish Board of Family and Children&#x27;s Services (formerly &quot;Jewish Board of Guardians&quot;) runs two residential schools in Hawthorne, the Hawthorne Cedar Knolls School and the Linden Hill High School; both of these schools are on Linda Avenue. Hawthorne Country Day School is located near the Valhalla border.

Hawthorne Cedar Knolls School with less than thirty students eligible to play varsity sports (football, basketball and baseball) boasted numerous championship teams in the varsity sports during the sixties and seventies (playing in a small school league named the Tri-State league, NY, NJ, and Conn.). HCKS went undefeated in all three varsity sports and winning the championships in 1972-1973 and again in 1974–1975).

<text>Irvington, sometimes known as Irvington-on-Hudson, is a suburban village of the town of Greenburgh in Westchester County, New York, United States. It&#x27;s a suburb of New York City, north of midtown Manhattan in New York City, and is served by a station stop on the Metro-North Hudson Line. To the north of Irvington is the village of Tarrytown, to the south the village of Dobbs Ferry, and to the east unincorporated parts of Greenburgh, including East Irvington. Irvington includes within its boundaries the community of Ardsley-on-Hudson, which has its own ZIP code and Metro-North station, but which should not be confused with the nearby village of Ardsley.

The population of Irvington at the 2020 census was 6,652. Because many of Irvington&#x27;s residents – especially those in the upper income brackets – live in Irvington and work in New York City, the village has a reputation as a &quot;commuter town&quot; or a &quot;bedroom community&quot;.

The village&#x27;s half-mile-long (0.8 kilometers) Main Street area has been designated as a historic district by New York State and on January 15, 2014, was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2010, &quot;Westchester Magazine&quot; ranked Irvington as the &quot;Best Place to Live in Westchester&quot;.

== History ==
Before the area where Irvington is now located was settled by Europeans, it was inhabited by the Wickquasgeck, a band of the Wappingers, related to the Lenape (Delaware) tribes which dominated lower New York state and New Jersey. The Wickquasgeck still lived in the area as late as 1775.

After the Dutch came to the area in the 1600s, the land was part of the Bisightick tract of the Adrian Van der Donck grant. Early settlers in the Irvington area were Stephen Ecker, Jan Harmes, Captain John Buckhout, and Barent Dutcher. The Van der Donck grant was purchased by Frederick Philipse in 1682, after the British had taken over the area in 1664. At first it was settled by tenant farmers, but by the 1700s, most of the settlers were artisans. The King&#x27;s Highway – later the Albany Post Road, and now Broadway – which connected New York City with Albany, was built through the settlement by the 1720s, which created a need for inns and taverns to supplement Odell&#x27;s Tavern, which was built in 1690.

In 1785, the state of New York confiscated the Phillipse&#x27;s land from his grandson, Frederick Philipse III, after he sided with the British in the American Revolution, and sold it to local patriot farmers who had been tenants of the Phillipse family. This is presumably how part of it came to be the farm of William Dutcher. Dutcher sold half of his farm to Justus Dearman in 1817, who then sold it to Gustavo F. Sacchi in 1848 for $26,000. Sacchi sold the parcel to John Jay – the grandson of the American Founding Father by the same name – that same year, and Jay laid it out as a village which he called &quot;Dearman&quot;, after Justus Dearman, and sold lots at auction in New York City starting on April 25, 1850.

The organization of the streets into a right-angled grid pattern was criticized by Andrew Jackson Downing, who was at the time the foremost expert on landscape design. Downing condemned the use of the street grid outside of cities and saw the hilly and heavily wooded site of Dearman as particularly suited to his own theories, which called for curvilinear roads and irregular lots which followed the contours of the land. With the frequent steamboat, stagecoach, and train transportation available, he felt that Dearman could have been an ideal suburb, instead of &quot;mere rows of houses upon streets crossing each other at right angles and bordered with shade trees&quot;.

The side streets off the village&#x27;s Main Street – or &quot;Main Avenue&quot;, as an 1868 map has it – were originally designated &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and so forth, but are today named after many of the area&#x27;s early settlers, such as Barent and William Dutcher, Captain John Buckhout (who lived to 103) and Wolfert Ecker (or &quot;Acker&quot;).

===American Revolution===

Wolfert Ecker&#x27;s house, then owned by Jacob van Tassel, was burned by the British in the Revolutionary War because it had become a notorious hang-out for American patriots. Washington Irving later wrote about it under the name of &quot;Wolfert&#x27;s Roost&quot; (&quot;roost&quot; meaning &quot;rest&quot;), and purchased and re-modeled another house on the land to become &quot;Sunnyside&quot;. Another early settler was Capt. Jan Harnse, and the Harnse-Conklin-Odell Tavern on Broadway was built in 1693 and became an inn in 1743. (See below) It was at Odell&#x27;s Tavern that the Committee of Safety, the executive committee of the legislature of the new State of New York, officially received the news that George Washington had lost the Battle of Long Island, and, later, British troops camped nearby, putting Jonathan Odell into custody in the Old Dutch Church in Sleepy Hollow. No major battles of the Revolutionary War were fought in the area, only minor skirmishes between residents and soldiers.

With the capture of New York City by the British, Irvington and the rest of southern Westchester County became the &quot;Neutral ground&quot;, an unofficial wide zone separating British-occupied territory from that held by the Americans, and the people of the area who remained – many of the Patriot population had fled – traded with both sides to great profit. However, there was also a great deal of pillaging and plundering, even of Tory households, both by the regular British army and loyalist militias and irregulars, all in the name of hunting down rebels. By the time the war was over, the countryside had been ravaged:

The country is rich and fertile, and the farms appear to have been advantageously cultivated, but it now has the marks of a country in ruins, a large portion of the proprietors having abandoned their homes. On the high road where heretofore was a continuous stream of travelers and vehicles, not a single traveler was seen from week to week, month to month. The countryside was silent. The very tracks of the carriages were grown over with grass or weeds. Travelers walked along bypaths. The villages are abandoned, the residents having fled to the north, leaving their homes, where possible, in charge of elder persons and servants.

Eventually, the area recovered and continued to develop. The Hudson River Railroad reached the settlement on September 29, 1849; the first passengers on a regularly scheduled run through the village paid fifty cents to travel from Peekskill to Chambers Street in Manhattan on September 29, 1849. By 1853, a ferry ran across the Hudson from Dearman to Piermont on the west bank, the village had a population of around 600, a hotel, six stores, a lumber yard and around 50 houses, and the hamlet of &quot;Abbotsford&quot; – which would later become Ardsley-on-Hudson – was forming along Clinton Avenue.

===A change of name===
In 1854, Dearman and Abbotsford combined, and by popular vote adopted the name &quot;Irvington&quot;, to honor the American author Washington Irving, who was still alive at that time and living in nearby &quot;Sunnyside&quot; – which is today preserved as a museum. Influential residents of the village prevailed upon the Hudson River Railroad, which had reached the village by 1849, to change the name of the train station to &quot;Irvington&quot;, and also convinced the Postmaster to change the name of the local post office as well. It was thus under the name of &quot;Irvington&quot; that the village incorporated on April 16, 1872.

By the census of 1860, the population of the village was 599. A few years later, in 1863, Irvington was touched by the New York Draft Riots. Fearing that the violence in the city, which had to be put down by Federal troops, would spread to Westchester, special police were brought in and quartered in a schoolhouse on Sunnyside Lane. They were commanded by James Hamilton – the third son of Alexander Hamilton – whose estate, Nevis, was on South Broadway. The presence of this special force deterred any violence a group of draft protestors which passed through Greenburgh on their way to Tarrytown may have intended. This was the only instance in which Civil War-related activity directly affected Irvington.

With convenient rail transportation now available, the village&#x27;s cool summer breezes off the Hudson and the rural riparian setting began to attract wealthy residents of New York City – businessmen, politicians and professionals – to the area to buy up farms and build large summer residences on their new estates, setting a pattern which would hold until the early 20th century. Still, the village continued to expand, with various commercial enterprises opening along the waterfront. Pateman &amp; Lockwood, a lumber, coal and building supply company, opened in the village in 1853, and Lord &amp; Burnham, which built boilers and greenhouses, in 1856. Both expanded to newly created land across the railroad tracks, in 1889 and 1912 respectively, and the Cypress Lumber Company opened on a nearby site in 1909. Notwithstanding this commercial activity, for many years, through the 19th and early 20th centuries, Irvington was a relatively small community surrounded by numerous large estates and mansions where millionaires, aristocrats and captains of industry lived – the population was reported as 2,299 in 1890 and 2,013 in 1898.

After World War I, some of the bigger estates in the area were broken up into smaller lots, and were developed into communities inside the village, such as Jaffray Park, Matthiessen Park and Spiro Park. Many of the estates and mansions are now gone, but a small number still exist. After World War II, cooperative apartment complexes were built in the village, but despite these changes, Irvington still has many large houses, and is still an overwhelmingly well-heeled community.

===Recent events===
In June 2016, Irvington Fire Chief Christopher D. DePaoli was one of 23 recipients of the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission medal for heroism. In April 2015, DePaoli stepped in when he saw a woman being attacked by a man with a knife at the Irvington Metro-North Station. DePaoli was able get between the man and the woman, the man&#x27;s girlfriend, who was on the ground being stabbed, and distract him with a baseball bat until the police arrived. The man was arrested and the woman survived the attack.

Since 2014, Irvington has held a &quot;Celebrate Irvington&quot; festival on the village&#x27;s Main Street in the early summer.

Irvington&#x27;s first murder since 1974 took place on April 25, 2018, when a recently-hired dishwasher stabbed Bonifacio Rodriguez, a prep cook, in the kitchen of the River City Grille at 6 South Broadway. The accused woman, New York City resident Rosa Ramirez, told police when she was arrested shortly after the incident. that she had suffered a &quot;psychotic break&quot;. Ramirez pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, a Class A felony, on February 21, 2020, in return for an expected sentence of 17 years to life, which was made official in September 2020.

In May 2020, a lawsuit was filed against an 18 year old Irvington High School senior, Ellis Pinsky, who was accused with co-conspirators from the US and Europe of swindling digital currency investor Michael Terpin – the founder and chief executive officer of Transform Group – of $23.8 million in 2018, when the accused was 15 years old, through the use of data stolen from smartphones by &quot;SIM swaps&quot;. The complaint alleges that Pinsky had a personal worth of $70 million as of December 2017. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in White Plains, New York and asked for triple damages. An investigation by the &quot;New York Post&quot; revealed that Pinsky lived a lavish lifestyle, driving an Audi R8, maintaining an account with a private air service, purchasing prime tickets to New York Rangers hockey games, and wearing expensive clothing. Pinsky had previously been recognized by the College Board as being an &quot;AP Scholar&quot;.

== Geography ==
The village has a total area of , of which or about is land and , or 30.94%, is water.

The village&#x27;s main thoroughfare is Broadway (Route 9) originally an Indian footpath which gradually became a horse track and then a dirt road. It came to be called the &quot;King&#x27;s Highway&quot; around the time that it reached Albany. Later, it was called the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Highway&quot;, after Queen Anne, the &quot;Highland Turnpike&quot; after 1800 – a name still preserved in the nearby town of Ossining – the &quot;Albany Post Road&quot; and, after 1850, &quot;Broadway&quot;. The stretch that runs through Irvington was completed by 1723. During his tenure as Postmaster General, Benjamin Franklin had sandstone milestone markers placed along the Broadway, inscribed with the distance from New York City. Milestone #27 is still in place in Irvington, near the driveway to 30 South Broadway.

Broadway runs north-south parallel to the river, and connects Irvington to Dobbs Ferry in the south and Tarrytown in the north. All of the village&#x27;s major streets, including Main Street, extend east and west from Broadway, and are designated as such. Broadway is designated &quot;North Broadway&quot; above Main Street, and &quot;South Broadway&quot; below it. Main Street begins at the Metro-North train station, just off the Hudson River, and travels uphill to Broadway. Side streets off of Main, which were originally designated A Street, B Street, C Street, etc. when the village grid was laid out, now have names, most of which come from local history: Astor, Buckhout, Cottenet, Dutcher, Ecker, Ferris and Grinnell.

The southbound Saw Mill River Parkway can be reached via Harriman Road/Cyrus Field Road, past the village reservoir, or East Sunnyside Lane/Mountain Road through East Irvington. The northbound Saw Mill and the New York State Thruway are accessible via Ardsley, and the Mario Cuomo Bridge is nearby in Tarrytown.

Commuter train service to New York City is available at the Irvington and Ardsley-on-Hudson train stations, served by the Metro-North Railroad of the MTA. Bus service is provided on Broadway by the Westchester County Beeline Bus System via route #1T (The Bronx-Yonkers-Tarrytown) and #1W (The Bronx-Yonkers-White Plains).

As with all river communities in Westchester, Irvington is traversed by a stretch of the old Croton Aqueduct, about long, which is now part of the Old Croton Trailway State Park. The Aqueduct is a National Historic Landmark.

Bloomberg ranked Irvington 54th in its March 2017 profile of &quot;America&#x27;s 100 Richest Places&quot;. In the 2018 survey, it ranked 67th of the over 6,200 places covered.

===Housing===
As of 2018, there were approximately 1,180 single-family homes in the village, as well as 100 multi-family homes.

Cooperative or condominium apartment complexes in the village include in the Fieldpoint development, Woodbrook Gardens located at 140 North Broadway, and Irvington Gardens at 120 North Broadway, as well as in the Half Moon development on South Buckhout Street.

In 1999, the village began a program to make affordable housing available to the public. Two buildings, The Burnham Building at 2 Main Street, and Hudson Views at Irvington at 1 South Astor Street, provide such units. As of February 2012, the village had passed a local ordinance requiring new developments to provide affordable housing.

The cost of housing in Irvington was pushed upwards by Greenburgh&#x27;s town-wide re-evaluation of property values, which was initiated in 2016.

== Economy ==
Although Irvington is still an affluent suburban &quot;bedroom community&quot;, with a large number of people commuting into New York City to work, there are also several notable businesses and institutions located in the village, such as:

* BrightFarms, a company that grows salad greens, is headquartered in Irvington.
* Verve Medical Cosmetics – In January 2021 this company announced that it will open Verve Loft Westchester in a left space on Bridge Street. It is expected to open on February 4.
* CastleGreen Finance, a private capital source focused on commercial PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy) financing, is headquartered in Irvington.

==Government and politics==
Irvington is one of six incorporated villages that lie within the town of Greenburgh. The village is governed by a mayor, who is elected every two years in odd-numbered years, and four trustees, who also serve two-year terms. Two of the trustees are elected in odd-numbered years, with the mayor and the other two in even-numbered years. Each year, the mayor appoints one of the trustees to be deputy mayor. A paid village administrator is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the village, assisted by a clerk-treasurer. The administration is divided into eleven departments:

*Administrator
*Building
*Clerk-Treasurer
*Fire
*Justice Court
*Library
*Parks and Recreation
*Police
*Public Works
*Town Hall Theater
*Water and Sewer

In addition, the mayor and board of trustees are assisted in the governance of the village by a number of voluntary boards and committees:

*Architectural Review Board
*Beautification Committee
*Cable Advisory Board
*Citizens&#x27; Budget Committee
*Climate Protection Task Force
*Community Advisory Board
*Environmental Conservation Board
*Ethics Board
*Library Board
*Main Street Zoning Committee
*Open Space Advisory Committee
*Parks and Recreation Master Plan Committee
*Planning Board
*Recreation Advisory Committee
*Theater Commission
*Trailways Committee
*Transportation Committee
*Tree Preservation Commission
*War Monument Committee
*Zoning Board of Appeals

Irvington is protected by its own 22-person police department, along with a volunteer fire department and volunteer ambulance corps, all of which are located on Main Street. Irvington&#x27;s government communicates with the village&#x27;s citizens through a newsletter, e-mail notifications and the village website.

===2005 mayoral election===
The controversial 2005 Irvington mayoral election was held on March 15, 2005, but was not decided until October 27, 2005. The race between Republican incumbent Dennis P. Flood and Democratic challenger Erin Malloy ended up being decided &quot;by lots&quot;, as required by New York state law when a village election is tied (847 votes for each candidate).

The count that took place on election night gave Flood a one-vote lead. On March 18, the Westchester County Board of Elections recounted the votes, giving Malloy a one-vote lead. Turning to two unopened absentee ballots, the board found that one was for Flood, resulting in a tie. The other absentee ballot was not opened as the name on the envelope did not match any names on the voter-registration list. Susan B. Morton, who had registered to vote as Susan Brenner Morton, stepped forward three days later and demanded that her vote for Malloy be counted. For several months afterward, various suits, motions, and appeals were filed in state courts. On October 20, the Court of Appeals, New York State&#x27;s highest court, denied requests by Malloy and Morton, leaving the election in a tie. To comply with state law, the village had to use random lots to decide the winner.

State law does not specify the method of drawing lots, so the village opted to draw quarters from a bag. Eight quarters were used. Four had a bald eagle on the back and represented Malloy. Flood was represented by four quarters with the Statue of Liberty on the back. Village Trustee/Deputy Mayor Richard Livingston, a Republican, drew a quarter from the bag. It was handed to Village Clerk Lawrence Schopfer, who declared Flood to be the winner. Flood was then sworn in for his sixth two-year term as mayor of Irvington.

Months later, to complicate the situation even more, it was learned that an Irvington resident who has two houses and was registered to vote in both Irvington and a Long Island suburb, inadvertently broke the law by voting in both elections, although his intent was to cancel his Irvington voter registration. He was an adamant supporter of Flood.

Erin Malloy was elected mayor in the election of 2007, but resigned in 2008 to spend more time with her injured daughter.

===Infrastructure===
Irvington is one of 83 communities in New York State which are being considered by the New York State Energy and Research Development Authority (ERDA) for the installation of a microgrid system, which would run under Main Street. The village&#x27;s power lines would be moved underground and solar and natural gas generators would be utilized to make it 80% power self-sufficient. In the initial phase, the board of trustees is in discussion with a possible technology provider. There are no current community microgrids in New York.

On March 4, 2021, Irvington received from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) bronze-level certification as being a &quot;Climate Smart Community&quot;, one of 65 such in the state. The certification was based on 17 actions taken by the village, including its Comprehensive Plan, last updated in 2018, an energy audit for the Town Hall, the village&#x27;s flood mitigation program, the conversion of 81.5 percent of the villages streetlight to LEDs, and the establishment of a drop-off food waste program. The Climate Smart program, which began in 2009, is designed to provide technical support and guidance to the efforts of communities to deal with the effects of climate change, by, for instance, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving their response to extreme weather. The village also participates in the ERDA&#x27;s &quot;Clean Energy Communities&quot; program, and has previously received grants from the DEC for flood mitigation and as part of its Municipal Zero-Emission Vehicle program.

== Education ==

===Primary and secondary schools===
Irvington Union Free School District&lt;br&gt;
The majority of Irvington is part of the Irvington Union Free School District, which also includes East Irvington, an unincorporated area of the Town of Greenburgh, and the Pennybridge section of Tarrytown, Irvington&#x27;s northern neighbor. The schools are Dows Lane School (K-3), Main Street School (4&amp;5), Irvington Middle School (6–8), and Irvington High School (9–12). The Middle School and High School are sited together on a combined campus on Heritage Hill Road off of North Broadway, on the site where the Stern castle, &quot;Greystone&quot;, once stood. Stern purchased the property from Augustus C. Richards in the late nineteenth century.

Small portions of Irvington extend into the Dobbs Ferry Union Free School District, the Ardsley Union Free School District, and the Elmsford Union Free School District.

Abbott School&lt;br&gt;
Located in Irvington, but not part of the regular public school district, was the Abbott School, which served homeless, neglected, abused, or developmentally disabled boys in grades 2 through 9. The students came both from the residential Abbott House, where the school was located, and as day students from community schools in Westchester County, Rockland County, and New York City. The school graduated its last class in 2011. Currently, Abbott House operates a number of programs to support children and families with challenging circumstances. Abbot House&#x27;s administrative offices remain in the former school building in Irvington.

Immaculate Conception School&lt;br&gt;
The Immaculate Conception School, a Catholic elementary school located in Irvington, was closed by the Archdiocese of New York in June 2008, after 100 years of existence. In the 2009–2010 school year, John Cardinal O&#x27;Connor School, a Catholic non-denominational school for students in grades 2 through 8 with learning disabilities, which had formerly been St. Ursula&#x27;s Learning Center in Mount Kisco, moved into the vacant building.

===Colleges===
There are no colleges totally within Irvington, although part of the campus of Mercy University, founded in 1950, is located there, while the majority is just over the southern border in Dobbs Ferry, very close to Irvington&#x27;s Ardsley-on-Hudson train station, which is sub-labelled &quot;Mercy College&quot;.

In 1890, schoolteacher Mary F. Bennett founded the Bennett School for Girls in the village. The school offered a six-year course of study: four years of high school and two of higher study. In 1907 it moved to Millbrook in Dutchess County, and dropped the high school grades, becoming a junior college; the school was renamed to Bennett College. In that same year, Marymount College was founded in Tarrytown, north of the village. It later became a campus of Fordham University, but closed in 2007.

Columbia University maintains in Irvington its Nevis Laboratories – which specializes in the preparation, design, and construction of high-energy particle and nuclear experiments and equipment, which are transported to major laboratories worldwide, and also houses the Radiological Research Accelerator Facility which specializes in microbeam technology. The grounds also hold an agricultural research center and the offices of Columbia University Press.

== Culture ==
In 2018 Brooke Lea Foster of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that Irvington was one of several &quot;Rivertowns&quot; in Westchester County, which she described as among the &quot;least suburban of suburbs, each one celebrated by buyers there for its culture and hip factor, as much as the housing stock and sophisticated post-city life.&quot; Of those, Foster stated that Irvington was the &quot;toniest&quot;.

The Town Hall Theater, opened in 1902 and restored in 1979-80, is located in the village&#x27;s &quot;Town Hall&quot;. It was designed to be a replica of Ford&#x27;s Theatre in Washington, and was widely thought to be one of the best &quot;opera houses&quot; in the Hudson Valley. It was used for public events such as school graduation ceremonies, police and fire balls, plays and other cultural events. Today, the Town Hall Theater presents a wide variety of events, including concerts, plays, musicals and film series. (For more, see below.)

In 2021, a lifelong resident of Irvington, Kamran Saliani, founded the Irvington Shakespeare Company and signed into an Arts Partnership with the Irvington Theater. In 2023, the organization evolved into Rivertowns Playhouse, establishing itself as the permanent secular resident theater company at the Irvington Presbyterian Church. 

=== Religion ===
Irvington has four Christian churches. Three of them, the Irvington Presbyterian Church (Presbyterian), the Immaculate Conception Church (Roman Catholic) and The Church of St. Barnabas (Episcopal), are clustered together on Broadway, just north of Main Street. The Calvary Chapel of Westchester (Evangelical) is located in the Trent Building on South Buckhout Street.

The Jewish community of Irvington is served by three nearby synagogues: the traditional/non-denominational Chabad of the Rivertowns, the conservative Greenburgh Hebrew Center in Dobbs Ferry and the dual reform/conservative synagogue Temple Beth Abraham in Tarrytown. Irvington itself features a &quot;chavurah&quot;, or member-led Jewish congregation that follows in the conservative tradition, known as Rosh Pinah Chavurah of the Rivertowns.

Irvington is also the location of the Westchester Buddhist Center, whose executive director is interior designer Stacy T. Curchak.

Irvington is home to a number of members of the Unification Church, including several high-ranking families. There are several Church-owned estates and buildings located in Irvington and in the neighboring village of Tarrytown. Reverend Sun Myung Moon, the founder and, until his death in 2010, the spiritual leader of the church, had a large private estate of , the former Frederic Clark Sayles estate, on East Sunnyside Lane. As of 2012, the estate was still owned by the church, under its legal name &quot;Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity&quot;.

== Local media ==
From 1912 to 1998, Irvington&#x27;s daily newspaper was the &quot;Tarrytown Daily News&quot;. In 1998, the Gannett Company, the last owner of the newspaper, combined all their area local papers, including the &quot;Daily News&quot;, into &quot;The Journal News&quot;, which serves Westchester, Rockland and Putnam counties, an area also referred to as the Lower Hudson Valley.

From 1907 to 1969, the village was also served by &quot;The Irvington Gazette&quot;, a weekly newspaper which was published on Aqueduct Street &quot;in the interest of the village of Irvington and vicinity&quot;. From 1975 to the present, the &quot;Rivertowns Enterprise&quot;, a weekly newspaper, has reported on local government, schools, sports, arts and business in Irvington as well as Ardsley, Dobbs Ferry, and Hastings-on-Hudson. Additionally, the &quot;Hudson Independent&quot;, a monthly free newspaper begun in 2006, serves Irvington, Sleepy Hollow, and Tarrytown, an area also covered by the &quot;River Journal&quot;, an online news site, and &quot;Rivertowns Patch&quot;.

== Historic Irvington ==
===Landmark protection===
Irvington is home to a number of historic landmarks and an historic district. In 2018, the village board of trustees passed local legislation which sought &quot;the protection and enhancement&quot; of landmarks and historic sites. The law will be enforced by an architectural review board which will designate &quot;sites, structures, buildings, markers and objects&quot; that &quot;cannot be duplicated or otherwise replaced&quot; and that are &quot;illustrative of the growth and development of our nation, our state and our Village and that are of particular historic or aesthetic value to Irvington.&quot; A village master plan promulgated in 2003 recognized around 200 hones dating from 1859 to 1930 which were worthy of consideration.

=== Points of interest ===

* Ardsley-on-Hudson Station House – The station house on the northbound side, which houses the waiting room and the Ardsley-on-Hudson post office, is all that is left of the McKim, Mead &amp; White-designed Tudor style buildings associated with the Ardsley Casino which was located there. The casino, established with the support of Jay Gould, Cornelius Vanderbilt, J. Pierpont Morgan, William Rockefeller, and Amzi Lorenzo Barber, had a golf course, tennis courts, stables, a private dock of the New York Yacht Club, and daily stagecoach service to the Hotel Brunswick on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. The casino was torn down in 1936 and was replaced by the Hudson House apartment building, designed by Shreve, Lamb and Harmon, which still stands. The station was used as a location for the 2016 film &quot;The Girl on the Train&quot;, with the addition of a portico to recreate the feel of the station as it existed in 1890. (110 West Ardsley Avenue)

* Armour-Stiner House (also known as the Carmer Octagon House) &quot;(1860)&quot; – Built by financier Paul J. Armour according to the ideas of Orson Fowler, the house originally had only two stories and a flat roof. Expanded – adding the dome and the veranda, as well as elaborate deocartions and embellishments – and refurbished by Joseph Stiner in 1872, the Armour-Stiner House is said to be one of the most lavish octagon houses built in the period, and is now one of only perhaps a hundred still extant. The house was later occupied by historian Carl Carmer, who maintained that it was haunted. In 1976, the house was briefly owned by the National Trust for Historic Preservation to prevent it from being demolished. The trust was unable to fund the amount of renovation the property required, and sold it to a preservationist architect, Joseph Pell Lombardi, who has conserved the house, interiors, grounds and outbuildings. The house is a National Historic Landmark. &quot;(West Clinton Avenue, west of the Old Croton Trail)&quot;

* Churches:
** Church of St. Barnabas &quot;(1853)&quot; – A stone Gothic building listed on the National Register of Historic Places (2000), the cornerstone of St. Barnabas was laid on May 29, 1853. It was originally intended as a chapel and school, and was designed by the Reverend Dr. John McVickar, a professor at Columbia College and the General Theological Seminary and friend of Washington Irving – his son, William McVickar, was the church&#x27;s first rector. The building was constructed from stone quarried on the former Rutter estate across Broadway, where the &quot;Fieldpoint&quot; development is now located. In the early 1860s the building was enlarged to become a parish church, to plans produced by the firm of Renwick and Sands. (James Renwick Jr. was the architect who would design the Irvington Presbyterian Church which stands next to St. Barnabas.) The &quot;Lich Gate&quot; entryway dates from circa 1896, and was designed by A. J. Manning, who later designed the Irvington Town Hall. The gate is made of solid oak on a stone foundation, and was a memorial to Mrs. H. B. Worthington. &quot;(North Broadway, north of Main Street)&quot;

** Irvington Presbyterian Church &quot;(1869)&quot; – A Romanesque church designed by James Renwick Jr., who also designed St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, New York; the stained-glass windows were designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany, who had once been an Irvington resident. The cost of construction was $53,0000. &quot;(North Broadway, north of Main Street)&quot;

Cosmopolitan Building &quot;(1895)&quot; – This three-story stone neo-Classical revival building topped by three small domes was designed by Stanford White as the headquarters for &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; when the magazine moved from New York to Irvington. John Brisben Walker, who had bought the general interest magazine in 1889, had a mansion in Irvington only a short walk away. In 1897 Walker started a free correspondence school, the Cosmopolitan Educational University Extension. When 20,000 people enrolled, Walker was unable to keep to its offer of a no-cost education for all, and had to ask the students to pay $20 per year. Nevertheless, the venture attracted well-known academics to its staff, and public lectures and other events associated with the school were held in the headquarters building. The magazine also sponsored several automobile races from New York to Irvington to promote the automobile. &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; left Irvington shortly after William Randolph Hearst bought the magazine in 1905 and moved it back to New York. Afterwards, the building was used as a silent movie studio for some period of time, but for most of its subsequent history has primarily housed manufacturing concerns of various types, including one that made radio oscillators used by the U.S. Army in World War II, and a company that made looseleaf binders and other paper products.The Cosmopolitan Building still stands, although it is known as the &quot;Trent Building&quot; after the family that owns it, but it is quite run down, and its visage has suffered from the pedestrian brick industrial building which was stuck onto its rear, obscuring the eastern facade. The building houses manufacturers, offices, a video production facility, a publisher of art books, interior design firms, a yoga studio, a chapel, photographers, a spa, a florist and event space and at least one restaurant. &quot;(50 South Buckhout Street)&quot;

* East Irvington Public School &quot;(1898, 1925)&quot; – Built in 1891 as a one-story schoolhouse for the community of East Irvington, the building was expanded to two stories in 1925, and accommodated all elementary school children in the area. In 1954, because of overcrowding, the village built the Dows Lane Elementary School, although the East Irvington School continued to be used for some grades until 1970, when it was closed. East Irvington, an unincorporated area of the town of Greenburgh which is part of the Irvington School District, but not of the Village of Irvington, had been known as &quot;Dublin&quot; due to the number of Irish immigrant workers living there, many of whom worked at the nearby quarry. The school building was converted to condominiums in 1983, when it was also placed on the National Register of Historic Places. A similar school is located in the section of Tarrytown known as &quot;Pennybridge&quot;, which is also part of the Irvington School District.

* Halsey Teahouse &quot;(1905)&quot; – A. J. Manning was commissioned by oil and cotton magnate Melchior Beltzhoover to build an exact replica of a Rhineland castle. The 44-room mansion, called &quot;Rochroane&quot;, was sold to Benjamin Halsey in 1927 and renamed &quot;Grey Towers&quot;. The estate was given by Halsey&#x27;s widow to the Irvington Catholic Church in 1976, and the castle burned down the next year (the exterior was stone, but the interior was wood). The estate was sold to a developer, who gave the pond to the village in exchange for the right to build residence on the property. The &quot;Halsey Playhouse&quot; or &quot;Teahouse&quot;, which was restored in 1997, is the last remnant of the estate, except for a Tiffany landscape window now in the Corning Museum of Glass. The Teahouse has two floors, and an open hexagonal tower with Gothic-arched windows, and there is a walkway and stone bridge around Halsey Pond, which the structure overlooks. Vestiges of a fountain, dam, and other structures can be seen in the nearby woods and backyards.

* Hermit&#x27;s Grave &quot;(1888)&quot; – Johann W. Stolting was a native of Heligoland who lived deep in the woods of Irvington as a hermit in the 19th century. He slept in his coffin, made of local chestnut wood, in a cabin overlooking the Saw Mill River valley. Stolting made his own clothes, wore sandals for shoes, but never wore a hat. He survived by selling wooden buttons made on a homemade foot-powered lathe. He died in 1888 at the age of 78, and his grave is only a few hundred feet west of the Saw Mill Parkway – the only marked grave in Irvington. The grave is reachable by a marked trail (the blue and white blazed &quot;HG&quot; trail) that begins at the north end of the village reservoir. &quot;(trail head at Fieldpoint Road)&quot;

* Hillside &quot;(1889)&quot; – Built in 1889 for medical doctor Carroll Dunham, the Colonial Revival mansion house was designed for 34 rooms with 16 fireplaces, gables and bay windows, a large staircase, walls of mahogany paneling, and glass designed by Irvington resident Louis Comfort Tiffany. The grounds were designed by Charles Eliot, who also planned the Boston park system with later alterations by Frederick Law Olmsted, the co-creator of New York City&#x27;s Central Park. The estate was sold shortly after Dunham&#x27;s death in 1923 to Gordon Harris, the son of American Tobacco Company founder William R. Harris. Gordon Harris, then Vice President of the United States Lines shipping company, and his family lived on the estate until 1946
* 

Irvington Historic District &quot;(2013-14)&quot;. In December 2002, a committee prepared for the trustees of the village of Irvington a comprehensive request for the New York State Department of Parks, Recreation of Historic Preservation to create a State and Federal historic district to include the heart of the village: that area of Irvington bounded by the Hudson River to the West, and Broadway to the East (to include Saint Barnabas and the Presbyterian Churches), by the gates of Barney Park to the South, and by the gates of Matthiessen Park to the North. This boundary being consistent with the original 1850s layout of Dearman, later renamed Irvington-on-Hudson. This proposal did not result in an historic district being created. In 2011, a second attempt was made, with a Historic District Committee being created and another application being made, this time covering Portions of Main St., W. Main St., River St., Bridge St., N. and S. Astor St., N. and S. Buckhout St., N. and S. Cottenet St., N. and S. Dutcher St., N. and S. Eckar St., N. and S. Ferris St., E. and W. Home Pl., Grinnel St., Aqueduct Ln., N. and S. Dearman St., and Broadway In September 2013, the proposal was accepted by the state, and in January 2014 by the National Register for Historic Places. The district includes 212 contributing and 43 non-contributing buildings, and 1 contributing site.

* Lord &amp; Burnham Building &quot;(1881)&quot; – Lord &amp; Burnham manufactured greenhouses – an excellent example of which can be seen at Lyndhurst, the estate of Jay Gould, in neighboring Tarrytown – and boilers. The Burnham factory building, built in 1881 to replace a factory that burned down on the same site that year, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1999. It has been renovated and repurposed into residences and the new home of the expanded Irvington Public Library. Across the railroad tracks, the buildings of Lord &amp; Burnham&#x27;s expansion factory have been renovated and transformed into upscale commercial real estate buildings known as Bridge Street Properties, which houses around 60 different companies, retail stores, and restaurants. &quot;(Foot of Main Street at the train station).&quot; Additionally, residential row houses originally constructed for Lord &amp; Burnham&#x27;s factory workers can be found at #10-#16A North Buckhout Street, north of Main Street.

* McVickar House &quot;(1853)&quot; – The McVickar House was built by Reverend John McVickar for his son, the Reverend William McVickar, the first rector of St. Barnabas Church. John McVickar&#x27;s own house was on Fargo Lane, not far from Sunnyside, and it is said that Washington Irving enjoyed the view from John McVickar&#x27;s house better than the one from his own. The backyard of the William McVickar house became the site of a Con Edison substation in 1957, and served as a doctor&#x27;s office until 1984. The Village of Irvington acquired it in 2002, and it was restored and renovated to be the headquarters of the Irvington Historical Society, opening in November 2005 as the Irvington History Center. The building is on the National Register of Historic Places (2003). &quot;(131 Main Street, between North Dearman and Broadway)&quot;

* Nevis &quot;(1836)&quot; – Columbia University&#x27;s Nevis Laboratories is located on a property originally owned by James Alexander Hamilton, the third son of Alexander Hamilton. He called the estate, which was originally , &quot;Nevis&quot; after the Caribbean island which was the birthplace of the elder Hamilton. The Greek revival mansion James Hamilton built in 1836 is still standing on the grounds. Over the years, the estate was reduced to . It was purchased by Mrs. T. Coleman DuPont of Delaware in 1920, and was given to Columbia by her in 1934, &quot;to make more satisfactory provision for its increasingly important work in landscape architecture and general horticulture.&quot; One early pamphlet remarked, &quot;Nevis is one of the superb examples of historic and landscape architecture in America. No other country place north of Maryland so perfectly exemplifies the taste of the Early Republican Period in our history.&quot; The property contains an inventory of 2,640 trees and 1,928 ornamental shrubs. Columbia began the construction of a physics laboratory with a cyclotron – at the time the world&#x27;s most powerful – in 1947, which was dedicated by Columbia&#x27;s president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1950. It was decommissioned in 1978. The laboratory continues to be used to study high-energy physics and astrophysics. &quot;(South Broadway)&quot;

* Nuits &quot;(1853)&quot; – This Italianate villa was built as a summer home by the textile importer Francis Cottenet (who came from Nuits-St.-George in France, and whose name adorns &quot;Cottenet Street&quot; in Irvington) out of brick faced with Caen stone – a light creamy-yellow limestone quarried in northwestern France near the city of Caen, and brought to America as ballast in Cottenet&#x27;s ships – to a design by the noted German architect Detlef Lienau. The house was built in two stages, the south entrance area first in 1853, and the north extension, which features a Lord and Burnham conservatory, in 1860. The house passed through numerous owners, including Cyrus Field, John Jacob Astor III and Amzi Lorenzo Barber. Nuits remains a private residence, albeit on rather than the original estate. Nuits, which is also known as the Cottenet-Brown House, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, and the house was restored between 1980 and 2000. &quot;(2 Clifton Place at Hudson Road, Ardsley-on-Hudson)&quot;

* Odell&#x27;s Tavern &quot;(1693)&quot; – The main part of the Odell-Conklin-Harmse Tavern, the oldest house extant in Irvington, is constructed of fieldstone, with walls that are four feet thick. It was built by Jan Harmse after he moved to the area from Long Island, and was converted to a tavern in 1742 Mathius and Sophia Conklin, a function it served until sometime in the 19th century. The &quot;Convention of the Representatives of the State of New York&quot; stopped there in April 1776, when Jonathan Odell was the proprietor, on their way out of New York City when the British occupied it, and discussed General Washington&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Long Island. In 1989, the Village of Irvington had the opportunity to purchase for $5.5 million the Murray-Griffin property that includes the Tavern, as well as 19th century barn and carriage house and a 23-room four-story Bedford stone house built in 1938, but did not. The Tavern, which in 2006 was reported as having undergone a recent restoration using artisans from Lyndhurst, is now part of a private residence and is not open to the public. &quot;(South Broadway at West Clinton Avenue)&quot;

* Shadowbrook &quot;(1895)&quot;, is a 9-acre estate built for banker Henry Graves, located at the corner of West Sunnyside Lane and Broadway just over the border in Tarrytown. It has been the home of Irving Berlin, the noted American songwriter, and jazz musician Stan Getz. It was designed by noted architect R. H. Robertson in the Tudor Revival style. Robertson also designed Richmond Hill, an estate located at the corner of Broadway and Harriman Road in Irvington, which was later utilized as a laboratory for the North American Philips Company and then the Yeshiva Ohel Shmuel, a boarding school for high school and college students, before being torn down in 1979–80 to be replaced by condominiums. Shadowbrook has been converted into multiple private residences, and is not open to the public, although the mansion is sometimes used for weddings and other events.&quot;(821 South Broadway, Tarrytown)&quot;

* Station Road Tunnel &quot;(1837–1842)&quot; – At Station Road, west of Broadway, the Old Croton Aqueduct passes overhead inside a large stone and earthwork viaduct which spans what was the culvert formed by Jewel&#x27;s Brook. Through the viaduct passes a single-lane tunnel to allow the road to pass through, and another smaller tunnel to the north to allow Jewel&#x27;s Brook – now known as Barney Brook – through as well. The tunnel plays a major part in the 2016 film &quot;The Girl on the Train&quot;. &quot;(Station Road west of South Broadway)&quot;

* Strawberry Hill &quot;(1855, expanded c.1870s)&quot; – This stone mansion in Norman Victorian Gothic style was built by John Thomas and expanded by Edward Delano Lindsay for John Williams. Still a private residence as of 1995, it has pointed gables, turrets and large shuttered windows. &quot;(North Broadway)&quot;

* Sunnyside &quot;(1656/1835)&quot; – In 1835 Washington Irving bought for $1,800 a two-room pitched-roofed Dutch farm house built in 1656 from the property that was William Ecker&#x27;s, and spent 15 years expanding and redesigning the house with the help of his friend and neighbor George Harvey, a landscape painter. Ten years later Irving continued, adding a tower his friends called &quot;The Pagoda&quot;. Today, the house is owned and operated as a museum by Historic Hudson Valley. &quot;(West Sunnyside Lane at the river)&quot;

:* Washington Irving Memorial &quot;(1927)&quot; - Designed by Daniel Chester French, America&#x27;s leading sculptor at the time and the designer of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the Irving memorial, which is on the National Register of Historic Places (2000), shows a bust of Irving flanked by two of his characters, Boabdil from &quot;The Alhambra&quot; and Rip van Winkle, all set against polished pink Vermont granite. &quot;(North Broadway at West Sunnyside Lane)&quot;

* Town Hall &quot;(1902)&quot; – The Irvington Town Hall, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, is built on land deeded to the village before the turn of the 20th century by the Mental and Moral Improvement Society of Irvington, of which Charles Lewis Tiffany – founder of Tiffany &amp; Co. and the father of Louis Comfort Tiffany – was the president. The society required that the building must have in perpetuity a reading room, and also specified that it have a public hall. The brick, stone and terra cotta building, which is called a &quot;Town Hall&quot; despite Irvington being only a village, was designed by Alfred J. Manning and cost $150,000 to build. The library was to replace the short-lived Irvington Free Library (later the &quot;Atheneum&quot;) which began in the local &quot;little red schoolhouse&quot;. The new library, which opened in 1902, was designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany, with Tiffany-glass lighting fixtures. The furnishings were donated by Helen Gould, the daughter of Jay Gould, and Frederick W. Guiteau – uncle of Charles J. Guiteau, who assassinated President James Garfield – paid for the books with a $10,000 endowment which he originally intended to bequeath to it in his will. Although in 2000 the library moved into the Burnham Building, a reading room, the &quot;Tiffany Room&quot;, remains in the Town Hall, to fulfill the requirements of the deed. The reading room was restored in 2004.In front of the Town Hall is a stone fountain memorial to Dr. Isaiah Ashton, the village physician who died in 1889. It was originally located on Broadway, where it was intended to be used to water horses. A recently installed statue of Rip Van Winkle stands next to the Town Hall, on the grounds of the Main Street School. Beginning on August 1, 2016, restoration of the exterior began. Although the project was held up by a work stoppage and contractual disputes with the contractor. The work, which will provide new windows, masonry and terra-cotta tiles specifically produced for the building, is projected to be completed by April 2017. &quot;(Main Street at North Ferris Street)&quot;
:* Town Hall Theater &quot;(1902, restored 1979-80)&quot; - The theater was designed to be a replica of Ford&#x27;s Theatre in Washington, where Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, and when completed in 1902 it was widely thought to be one of the best &quot;opera houses&quot; in the Hudson Valley. For decades the social life of Irvington revolved around the theater, which hosted concerts, recitals, balls, cotillions, graduations, minstrel shows, auditions, political rallies and public meetings. Eleanor Roosevelt spoke at a Democratic rally just before her husband was elected President in 1932. Opera singer Lillian Nordica performed there, and Ted Mack auditioned talent for his &quot;Original Amateur Hour&quot; there as well. However, it gradually fell into disuse and disrepair by the 1960s, being used only for occasional exhibitions and overnight &quot;camping&quot; by the local Boy Scout troops. In 1978 concerted citizen action started the ball rolling to completely renovate and revitalize the theater, and it re-opened in 1980, run by Irvington Town Hall Theater, Inc., a non-profit corporation under the auspices of the Town Hall Theater Commission, whose members are appointed by the mayor. Today, the Town Hall Theater presents a wide variety of events, including concerts, plays and musicals – as well as the &quot;Best of Film&quot; series begun in 2007, an &quot;All Shorts&quot; film festival started in 2015, and a Playwright Festival inaugurated in 2017, – in its 432-seat facility. In 2016, the village received community revitalization funding as part of New NY Bridge, which it will use to create a street-level plaza for the theater. As of 2019, the theater&#x27;s website was using the name &quot;Irvington Theater&quot;. In April 2021, the Irvington Shakespeare Company was founded to perform at the theater. &quot;(Main Street at North Ferris Street)&quot;

* Villa Lewaro &quot;(1917)&quot; – Among Irvington&#x27;s famous residents was Madam C. J. Walker, America&#x27;s first female millionaire. An African American woman, she made her fortune by developing a line of hair care products, creating a company with 20,000 sales agents, and by investing in real estate. In 1917, Madam Walker had a $250,000 country home built on Broadway in Irvington, designed by Vertner Woodson Tandy, the first registered African-American architect in New York State. She wanted the home to be an example for her people, &quot;to see what could be accomplished, no matter what their background.&quot; The name Villa Lewaro was coined by Enrico Caruso, from the first two letters of each word in Lelia Walker Robinson, the name of her daughter, who later went by the name of A&#x27;Lelia Walker.
:Walker inherited the house, and occupied it until her death in 1931, when it was bequeathed to the NAACP which opted to take the proceeds from the sale of the house rather than assume the cost of taxes and upkeep during the Great Depression. The house became the Annie E. Poth Home, a retirement home for seniors operated by the Companions of the Forest, until the 1970s. The neo-Palladian-style mansion still stands today, and is again a private residence. &quot;Villa Lewaro&quot; is a National Historic Landmark. &quot;(North Broadway at Fargo Lane)&quot;
* Wisteria Cottage - This private residence located at 359 Mountain Road in the East Irvington neighborhood, was the place where Albert Fish – who would later serve as the inspiration for the character Hannibal Lecter – murdered and ate 10-year old Grace Budd in 1928. The house was abandoned at the time that Fish brought the child there on the premise that she would be attending his niece&#x27;s birthday party, but both the niece and the party were inventions. Fish already had a history of molesting and torturing disabled children, and had specifically picked out the house to murder his next victim. The house sold c.2016 for over a million dollars.

==Quality of life==
In an October 2010 ranking of the &quot;Best Places to Live&quot;, &quot;Westchester Magazine&quot; listed Irvington as #1 and called it &quot;charming, quiet, green, with a darling Main Street, stunning river views, [and] a burgeoning dining scene... a great mix.&quot; Factors in which Irvington was not highly ranked included &quot;Diversity&quot; and &quot;Property tax&quot;, both with a score of four out of ten, and &quot;Housing cost&quot;, with a five.

In May 2015, the village released a report which indicated that its water supply exceeded the requirements laid down by the State of New York.

In November 2016, &quot;Rivertowns Patch&quot; rated Irvington 17th among the &quot;30 Safest Places To Live In New York – 2016&quot;. Its violent crime rate per 1000 was 0.2, and its property crime rate, also per 1000, was 2.7.

Niche.com, a rating and ranking website, listed Irvington as #16 of all New York locations on its list of &quot;Best Suburbs to Live in New York State&quot;, one of 28 choices in the Hudson River Valley, although Irvington was not listed among the top 100 in the U.S. Factors considered for the April 2017 list included the quality of the schools, the crime rate, employment, amenities, using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. the U.S. Census Bureau, and the FBI. In May 2017, Niche rated Irvington as &quot;A+&quot; in their list of the best and worst places to live in New York.

On the other hand, in February 2016 the website &quot;RoadSnacks&quot;, in an article which made clear that it was &quot;opinion based on fact&quot; and intended as &quot;infotainment&quot;, not as serious science, listed Irvington as the third most boring place in New York State, after Briarcliff Manor and Rye Brook in Westchester, and just above Croton-on-Hudson, also in Westchester, and Chestnut Ridge in Rockland.

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many wealthy New York City residents abandoned the city to move to places which were considered to be safer and less affected by the virus, Irvington was one of the places in Westchester County which showed &quot;a significant increase in sales by New York City residents&quot;.

===Parks and recreation===
As of 2018 about 35% of Irvington&#x27;s land is undeveloped public land, and, as of 2010, 23 percent of the land in Irvington is set aside for parks and recreation. Three of Irvington&#x27;s parks, Memorial Park &quot;(Dows Lane or Station Road)&quot;, Matthiessen Park &quot;(Bridge Street off Astor Street)&quot;, and Halsey Pond Park, are open only to village residents with a permit, but others are accessible by the general public. The Irvington Parks and Recreation Department is located in the Isabel K. Benjamin Community Center on Main Street.

*There are no public golf courses located in Irvington, but the Ardsley Country Club, a private club founded in 1895, is located in Ardsley-on-Hudson, which is part of Irvington. The Ardsley Curling Club is located on the grounds of the country club.
*Westchester County&#x27;s V. Everit Macy Park is partly located in Irvington, along the Saw Mill River Parkway at the eastern side of the village boundaries. Created in 1926 and originally called &quot;Woodlands Park&quot;, it was renamed for the scion of the Macy family, who was Westchester&#x27;s first commissioner of public welfare and later became a local newspaper baron. The park has three distinct areas with slightly different atmospheres. One part, with an entrance in Ardsley (not Ardsley-on-Hudson) on Saw Mill Road, functions as a local park with ballfields, a playground, public toilets and picnic pavilion. Another, accessible by car only by the northbound lanes of the Saw Mill River Parkway, features the Great Hunger Memorial commemorating the Irish famine of 1845–1852 which drove many Irish immigrants to settle in Westchester. The area also includes Woodlands Lake, with fishing, ice skating, a recently-closed restaurant, access to the South County Trailway, and of the former Putnam Division Railroad. The final area is largely undeveloped. A county park permit may be required for some uses of the park.
*Irvington Woods Hiking Trails – an extensive network of hiking trails, most of them fairly non-strenuous, criss-crosses the woods between Broadway and the Saw Mill River Parkway. Highlights of the area include the Irvington Reservoir and its associated watershed as well as the Hermit&#x27;s Grave, the grave of a 19th century immigrant who called the woods his home. &quot;(trailheads on Cyrus Field Road, Mountain Road, Fieldpoint Road, and East Field near Irvington High School)&quot;
*The Old Croton Trailway State Historic Park and Trail, which runs along the Croton Aqueduct, traverses the village between Broadway and the Hudson River, and is a popular biking and jogging path. In 2016 the village received funding from the New York State Department of Transportation to improve the trail&#x27;s crossing of Main Street with input from the New York State Parks Department. &quot;(west of Broadway)&quot;
*Scenic Hudson Park, which is co-owned by the village and the Scenic Hudson Land Trust, is located on the river side of the railroad tracks, not far from the foot of Main Street. Pedestrians can use the underpass at the train station while cars cross the tracks via Bridge Street. The park has ballfields, children&#x27;s playgrounds, about a mile of flat walking paths, a boat launch and of lawn. In 2016, &quot;The Journal News&quot; called the park &quot;one of Westchester County&#x27;s most popular public spaces.&quot; &quot;(Bridge Street at the river)&quot;
*Just south of the village&#x27;s Matthiessen Park lies the Irvington Boat and Beach Club, a private club founded in the 1950s which is supported by member dues. The club is located off Bridge Street, and lies on land owned by Bridge Street Properties. The club has a pier connected to a floating dock from which members can swim, sunbathe or launch boats and kayaks. In 2017, the club spent $9,000 to shore up six of the pier&#x27;s pilings. On Friday March 2, 2018, one of 6 runaway construction barges connected to the building of the nearby Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, which broke away during a nor&#x27;easter with over winds, crashed into the pier, destroying it. The club&#x27;s Vice Commodore speculated that the barge went upriver during high tide, and came back down during low tide. One of the other barges capsized off of Yonkers, south of Irvington, while two others ran aground near Alpine, New Jersey, across the river. The Coast Guard, assisted by Westchester County Police Marine Unit, intercepted the remaining two barges.

===Restaurants===
One of the first of the notable restaurants to be founded in Irvington was &quot;Mima Vinoteca&quot; on Main Street, begun by Dana Santucci in 2007. In 2009, &quot;Westchester Magazine&quot; named Irvington as the best place for &quot;foodies&quot; to live on the west side of Westchester County, although the article named only two restaurants in the village itself – &quot;Red Hat&quot; and &quot;Chutney Masala&quot; – as well as others in nearby Dobbs Ferry, Hastings and Tarrytown. In May 2012, chef Michael Psilakis opened &quot;MP Taverna&quot; in a space in the former Lord &amp; Burnham warehouses near the river. In 2013, the &quot;Sixty One Bistro&quot; opened at 61 Main Street, and in November 2014, &quot;Wolfert&#x27;s Roost&quot; – named after the original name of Washington Irving&#x27;s Sunnyside estate – opened at 100 Main Street with an &quot;exuberant&quot; menu, which includes a 38-ounce steak for $129 that &quot;looks like something Fred Flintstone might have slapped on the grill&quot;; in October 2016 it was announced that it would be closing as a full-time restaurant in favor of catering and occasional &quot;pop up&quot; restaurants. The owner, Eric Korn, was also opening a traditional pizza shop on the same block. Also on Main Street is &quot;La Chinita Poblana&quot;, which also opened in 2014, a strong, un-&quot;kitschy&quot; Mexican restaurant decorated with paintings by Diego Rivera, and &quot;Chutney Masala&quot;, a Tandoori restaurant, which moved in 2016 from the Irvington waterfront to 76 Main Street. In October 2016, the owner of &quot;Chutney Masala&quot; opened &quot;Sambal Thai and Malaysian&quot; on Main Street.

In addition, Irvington&#x27;s former New York Central Railroad station house, which was a ticket office from 1889 to 1957, is now, in 2016, with the addition of an outdoor garden, &quot;Brrzaar&quot;, a 20-seat café. In December 2020, &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine highlighted the &quot;Irvington Delight Market&quot;, a bodega on the corner of South Broadway and Main Street, which specializes in homemade Middle Eastern food, as one of &quot;100 Restaurants America Can&#x27;t Afford to Lose&quot;.

<text>Lake Mohegan, commonly known as Mohegan Lake, is a census-designated place (CDP) located in the Town of Yorktown in Westchester County, New York, United States.

There is a private lake, Mohegan Lake, also known as &quot;Lake Mohegan&quot;, with beaches which are occasionally closed for swimming due to harmful algal blooms.

The town was home to several former summer bungalow colonies in the 1950s and 1960s. They included the Skyview Colony and Lakeview Colony off U.S. Route 6.

==Etymology==
Mohegan Lake was named &quot;Lake Mohegan&quot; in 1859 by William Jones, who owned the Mount Pleasant Hotel on the eastern side of the lake.

The Mohegan were a tribe of Native Americans once associated with the Pequot of easternmost Connecticut, who were pushed successively west to the area of the Housatonic River during the 17th and into the 18th century. There is no indication of them ever inhabiting northern Westchester County in the vicinity of Peekskill, or any other nearby area.

The change in syntax, reversing the modern community&#x27;s name to &quot;Mohegan Lake&quot;, dates back to the early 1970s, before which residents commonly referred to it as &quot;Lake Mohegan&quot;, the name still used by the United States Census Bureau for the CDP. The population in the 2010 Census was 6,010.

<text>Larchmont is a village located within the Town of Mamaroneck in Westchester County, New York. Larchmont is a suburb of New York City, located approximately northeast of Midtown Manhattan. The population of the village is 6,453 as of the World Population Review. In February 2019, Bloomberg ranked Larchmont as the 15th wealthiest place in the United States and the third wealthiest in New York.

==History==

===Colonial period===
Originally inhabited by the Siwanoy (an Algonquian tribe), Larchmont was explored by the Dutch in 1614. In 1661, John Richbell, a merchant from Hampshire, England, traded a minimal amount of goods and trinkets with the Siwanoy in exchange for land that is today known as the Town of Mamaroneck. The purchase included three peninsulas of land that lay between the Mamaroneck River to the east and Pelham Manor to the west. The east neck is now known as Orienta while the middle neck is what is now known as Larchmont Manor. The third neck was later sold and is now known as Davenport Neck in New Rochelle. The purchase was contested by Thomas Revell who, one month following Richbell&#x27;s purchase, bought the land from the Siwanoy at a higher price. Richbell petitioned Governor Stuyvesant, Director General of the Colonies of the New Netherland, and Richbell was issued the land patent in 1662. In 1664 Great Britain took control of the colonies and Richbell received an English title for his lands in 1668 whereupon he began to encourage settlement. In 1675 Richbell leased his &quot;Middle Neck&quot; to his brother however when he died in 1684 none of his original property remained in his name. In 1700, Samuel Palmer, who had been elected the Town&#x27;s first supervisor in 1697, obtained the original leases on the &quot;Middle Neck&quot;, and in 1722 the Palmer family obtained full title to the land which included what is now the Incorporated Village of Larchmont.

Larchmont&#x27;s oldest and most historic home, the &quot;Manor House&quot; on Elm Avenue, was built in 1797 by Peter Jay Munro. Munro was the nephew of John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and was later adopted by Jay. At the beginning of the 19th century, Munro was active in the abolitionist movement, helping to found the New York State Manumission Society, along with his uncle and Alexander Hamilton. In 1795 Munro had purchased much of the land owned by Samuel Palmer and by 1828 he owned all of the &quot;Middle Neck&quot; south of the Post Road and much of the land north of the Post Road as well. Munro later became a lawyer with Aaron Burr&#x27;s law firm and built a home in Larchmont Manor known as the Manor House. Munro&#x27;s house faced towards the Boston Post Road (the back is now used as the front), which tended to generate a lot of dust in summer months. To combat this, his gardener imported a Scottish species of larch trees that were known to be fast growing. These were planted along the front of the property, eventually giving the village its name.

===Summer resort===
When Munro died in 1833, his son Henry inherited the property which he subsequently lost and sold at auction in 1845 to Edward Knight Collins, owner of a steamship line. By the end of the Civil War in 1865, Collins had gone bankrupt and his estate was put up for auction and purchased by Thompson J.S. Flint. Flint divided the estate into building lots and called his development company the Larchmont Manor Company. Flint converted the Munro Mansion into an inn for prospective buyers and reserved some waterfront land for use as a park for the future residents of the Manor. After 1872 the area became a popular summer resort for wealthy New Yorkers. The arrival of the New York &amp; New Haven Railroad replaced the stagecoach and steamboat as the main mode of transportation to and from New York City, making it much easier to commute and thus, modernizing travel which ultimately helped develop much of Westchester from farmland into suburbs by the 1900s.

===Establishment of village===
The New York legislature created Mamaroneck as a town in 1788, which includes a part of the Village of Mamaroneck, The Village of Larchmont, and the unincorporated area in the Town of Mamaroneck. This three part division occurred in the 1890s to meet the growing demand for municipal services which the town could not provide. At the time, a town was defined as only being able to provide basic government functions leaving residents of Larchmont in need of adequate water supply, sewage disposal, garbage collection, and police and fire protection. In 1891 the residents of Larchmont Manor obtained a charter from the legislature in which they incorporated that section of Town into a village. In order to comply with a law requiring incorporated villages to have at least 300 inhabitants per square mile, the boundaries of the newly incorporated Larchmont village were expanded beyond the Manor&#x27;s to include land to its north and south of the railroad, and east to Weaver Street.

After the advent of the automobile, Larchmont quickly transitioned from a resort community into one of the earliest suburbs in the United States, catering to wealthy individuals commuting to and from New York City for work on a daily basis. Many of the Victorian &quot;cottages&quot; and a grand hotels (such as the Bevan House and Manor Inn) remain to this day, though these have been converted to other uses such as private residences. The Larchmont Yacht Club hosts an annual Race Week competition (2007 marked the 110th running of this event). It is adjacent to Manor Park, which was designed by Jeremiah Towle, an early summer resident of Larchmont Manor and an engineer.

<text>Lewisboro is a town in Westchester County, New York, United States. The population was 12,265 at the 2020 census. The town is named after John Lewis, an early settler. Lewisboro is a suburb of New York City.

== History ==

After purchasing land from the local natives, the first settlers established themselves around South Salem. The town was formed as &quot;Salem&quot; in 1747. By 1790 the town assumed its current dimensions as lands were removed for other towns. The name changed to South Salem in 1806. John Lewis, a financier, requested that the town be given his name and established a fund for the town, though he did not follow through on his promise of a railroad link. An abundance of natural open space, Dry-stone walls and elegant Colonial mansions are dominant features.

Lewisboro has had two noteworthy historical characters. Sarah Bishop was the hermit of West Mountain. Apparently mistreated by British soldiers at the time of the Revolutionary War, she retreated to a solitary life in the Lewisboro area. A spot known as &quot;Sarah Bishop&#x27;s Cave&quot; is on the hill on the north side of Lake Rippowam, near Mountain Lakes Camp. The second historical character appeared around the time of the Civil War. The Leatherman was a wanderer who got his name from homemade leather garments. He is frequently mentioned as being in Lewisboro in the middle of the 19th century. He followed a route past homes that would offer him a meal and reappeared at the same doorsteps for 25 years. One of the hiking destinations in Ward Pound Ridge is to the Leatherman&#x27;s cave, reportedly one of his more frequent homes. In 1987, a 10k trail race called &quot;The Leatherman&#x27;s Loop&quot; was started to honor his legacy and continues every spring at the Ward Pound Ridge Reservation.

The Mead Memorial Chapel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.

==Geography==

The east town line is the border of Ridgefield, Connecticut and Wilton, Connecticut, while the southern border is the town of New Canaan, Connecticut. Interstate 684 passes near the west side of the town.

==Lakes and reservoirs==

There are 7 lakes in the town of Lewisboro. Lake Waccabuc, Lake Oscaleta, and Lake Rippowam are interconnected and are collectively known as the Three Lakes, and are natural (not man-made) lakes. Lake Waccabuc is the largest and most well-known of these, and the area of town named after it has a separate post office. Lake Oscaleta and Lake Rippowam are also called the Twin Lakes, probably because of Twin Lakes Village, a development which runs between them. The other lakes in town are Lake Truesdale, Lake Katonah, Lake Kitchawan, and Timber Lake. Recognizing the importance of the lake communities in the town, in 2007 a Lakes Committee was formed by the Town of Lewisboro.

Additionally, there are a number of reservoirs in the town of Lewisboro, utilized by cities such as Norwalk, Connecticut.

<doc id="127573" wikidata="Q835831" url="?curid=127573" title="Mount Vernon, New York">
<text>Mount Vernon is a city in Westchester County, New York, United States. It is an inner suburb of New York City, immediately to the north of the borough of the Bronx. As of the 2020 census, Mount Vernon had a population of 73,893, making it the 24th-largest municipality in the state and largest African-American majority city in the state. Mount Vernon has 12,898 Jamaicans with African and Indian descent that had immigrated from their homeland of Jamaica after the country gained its independence from Britain on August 6, 1962.

Mount Vernon has two major sections. South-side Mount Vernon is more urban, while north-side Mount Vernon is more residential. Mount Vernon&#x27;s downtown business district is on the city&#x27;s south side, which includes City Hall, Mount Vernon&#x27;s main post office, Mount Vernon Public Library, office buildings, and other municipal establishments.

==History==
The Mount Vernon area was first settled in 1664 by families from Connecticut as part of the Town of Eastchester. Mount Vernon became a village in 1853, and a city in 1892. Early development was driven by the New York Industrial Home Association No. 1, a home building cooperative organized to build homes for &quot;tradesmen, employees, and other persons of small means&quot;.

Mount Vernon takes its name from George Washington&#x27;s Mount Vernon plantation in Virginia, much as neighboring Wakefield (in the Bronx) was named for the Virginia plantation where Washington was born.

In 1894, the voters of Mount Vernon participated in a referendum on whether to consolidate into a new &quot;City of Greater New York&quot;. The cities of Brooklyn (coterminous with Kings County) and Long Island City, the western towns and villages of Queens County, and all of Richmond County (present day Staten Island) all voted to join with the existing city (present day Manhattan and The Bronx). However, the returns were so negative in Mount Vernon and the adjacent city of Yonkers that those two areas were not included in the consolidated city and remain independent to this day.

The Mount Vernon Public Library, a gift to the city from Andrew Carnegie, opened in 1904 and is now part of the Westchester Library System, providing educational, cultural and computer services to county residents of all ages. The Mount Vernon Trust Company opened in 1903. It was the largest bank in Westchester County, with branches in the east and west sections of the city.

During the 1960s, Mount Vernon was a divided city on the brink of a &quot;northern style&quot; segregation. Many African Americans from the southern United States migrated north and settled in the city of Mount Vernon for better job opportunities and educational advancements. At the same time, many white Americans from the Bronx and Manhattan looked to Mount Vernon as a new &quot;bedroom community&quot; because of rising crime in New York City (a &quot;white flight&quot; factor contributed as well). As a result, Mount Vernon became divided in two by the New Haven Line railroad tracks of the Metro-North Railroad: North Side and South Side. The population south of the tracks became predominantly African-American, while that north of the tracks was largely white.

At the height of this segregation in the 1970s, August Petrillo was mayor. When he died, Thomas E. Sharpe was elected mayor. Upon Sharpe&#x27;s death in 1984, Carmella Iaboni took office as acting mayor until Ronald Blackwood was elected; Blackwood was the first Afro-Caribbean mayor of the city (as well as of any city in New York State). In 1996, Ernest D. Davis was elected the mayor of Mount Vernon; he served until 2007. Clinton I. Young, Jr. became the city&#x27;s mayor on January 1, 2008. Four years later, on January 1, 2012, Ernest D. Davis became the 21st mayor of Mount Vernon. In 2013, Davis was investigated for failure to report rental income. In 2015, Richard Thomas defeated Davis in an upset victory in the September primary. in the November general election, Thomas received 71% of the votes to become the mayor of Mount Vernon.

In the subsequent 2019 election, Shawyn Patterson-Howard unseated the incumbent Mayor Thomas in a hotly contested June primary to become the new Democratic nominee and went on to capture 81% of the vote to defeat André Wallace (who had since been named Acting Mayor and ran as a Republican) in the general election in November to become the first black woman mayor of Mount Vernon (and of any city in Westchester County).

Mount Vernon has in recent years undergone a transition from a city of homes and small businesses to a city of regional commerce. Between 2000 and 2006, Mount Vernon&#x27;s economy grew 20.5%, making it one of the fastest-growing cities in the New York metropolitan area.

In January 2019, Moody&#x27;s withdrew its credit rating for Mount Vernon because of the city&#x27;s failure to provide audited financial statements. The failure to prepare and deliver audited financial statements stemmed from a disagreement as to which entity would pay for the audit of the Urban Renewal Agency (URA), one of the city&#x27;s agencies, and which auditing firm would perform the audit. Further clouding the city&#x27;s financial condition is the prospect that it might have a repayment obligation to HUD in connection with grants previously awarded to the city 

=== 2019 mayoral dispute ===
On July 9, 2019, mayor Richard Thomas pleaded guilty to stealing campaign funds and lying to the State Board of Elections. Thomas was ordered to resign from office by September 30, 2019. The city council then appointed council president Andre Wallace as acting mayor. Thomas refused to resign from his post. Wallace then appointed Shawn Harris as new police commissioner. After arriving for work, Thomas ordered the Mount Vernon Police to arrest Harris for trespassing. Harris was released after an order from the Westchester County District Attorney. Both Thomas and Wallace occupied offices in the city hall, with Thomas in the mayor&#x27;s office, under the guard of the Mount Vernon Police. Finally, before a packed courtroom in White Plains, Judge Ecker made a decisive ruling that Thomas had actually vacated the office of mayor on July 8, that Wallace had automatically assumed the office at that time, and that Wallace would be the acting mayor of Mount Vernon until January 1, 2020.

=== Mount Vernon Charter Revision Commission ===
In March 2019, Mayor Richard Thomas called for the formation of the Mount Vernon Charter Revision Commission, suggesting the charter was antiquated, dating to the late 19th century. In August 2019, the Commission presented its final report which included four key proposed changes to the City&#x27;s Charter:
# A new requirement for annual financial audits.
# Quarterly financial reports showing the city&#x27;s fiscal condition.
# An updated comprehensive plan for economic growth.
# A periodic review of the city charter.

Beyond the regular political powers of elected officials, the City of Mount Vernon also has a checks and balances voting session called the Board of Estimate.

===City council===
The city council consists of five representatives, elected at-large, one of whom is the city council president. The city council president is appointed/elected by the existing city council members. Under normal circumstances the council presidency is rotated, as are the council committee assignments as chair of the four council committees. In recent years, the full rotation has ceased to reappoint the more experienced council members. The council president also serves as mayor, in the absence of the mayor. This can occur when the mayor is out of town, had resigned, or dies in office. When this happens the president pro tempore becomes acting city council president and the acting president pro tempore becomes assumes his/her duties.

===Mayor===
===Comptroller===
===Board of Estimate===
The Board of Estimate is composed of the mayor, the city council president, and the comptroller. The city council president votes on behalf of the city council. All monetary decisions, including the annual budget and many legal ramifications, must pass vote of the Board of Estimate, which meets every Tuesday after the city council&#x27;s Wednesday legislative session.

==Court system==

The Mount Vernon city court is part of the New York State Unified Court System. It has three elected full-time judges who serve for ten years and one part-time associate judge who is appointed by the mayor for a period of eight years. The judges of the court are William Edwards, Adrian Armstrong, and Nichelle Johnson. Adam Seiden serves as an associate judge of the court. The court handles a wide variety of cases, including initial processing of all felony criminal cases; handling of all misdemeanor cases from inception through trial; civil proceedings with a limited monetary jurisdiction of up to $15,000; all landlord tenant cases originating in the city; small claims cases; and all vehicle and traffic law matters. The court is housed in the public safety complex, which is adjacent to City Hall.

==Education==
Mount Vernon City School District includes 11 elementary schools, two middle schools, two high schools and one alternative high school.
Westchester Community College has an extension site education facility, downtown.

In 2011, &quot;The Journal News&quot; featured an article titled &quot;Region&#x27;s Aging Schools Crumble as Finances Falter&quot;, by Cathey O&#x27;Donnell and Gary Stern. The article discussed several old school buildings within the region that were in disrepair, how much it would cost to fix them, and which if any might need to be demolished. The Mount Vernon school district was included in the article, which stated:

:&quot;In Mount Vernon, meanwhile, where a high school wall collapsed last year, inspectors flagged buildings for insufficient smoke detectors, poor air quality, evidence of rodents and vermin, halls without emergency lighting and junction boxes with exposed live wires.&quot;

==Infrastructure and services==
===Fire department===
The city of Mount Vernon is protected by Fire Department of the City of Mount Vernon (FDMV).The FDMV currently operates out of four firehouses, throughout the city, under the command of the Chief of Operations. The department operates four engine companies and two ladder companies. The department responds to approximately 14,000 emergency calls annually.

=== Police department ===
As of 2021, the Mount Vernon Police Department has 184 officers.

In May 2021, the District Attorney for Westchester County requested intervention by the Department of Justice (DOJ) for civil rights violations by the Mount Vernon Police Department. The DOJ announced its civil investigation in December 2021.

===Healthcare===
The 115-year-old Mount Vernon Hospital has 121 beds. It is part of the Montefiore Health System and provides in-patient, critical care, and ambulatory services to residents of Mount Vernon and neighboring communities. The hospital is most known for its premier Chronic Wound Treatment and Hyperbaric Center, which is one of the most advanced in the Northeast. It also offers a variety of services, including the Assertive Community Treatment Center (ACT), the Family Health and Wellness Center, the Hopfer School of Nursing, Hyperbaric Medicine, and Intensive Case Management.

Mount Vernon Hospital is one of four hospitals in the county that provides programs in medicine, nursing, podiatry, and surgery. (Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital, Westchester Medical Center, and White Plains Hospital are the others.)

Mount Vernon Hospital&#x27;s emergency room treats 25,000 patients a year and is going to be expanded at a cost of $2.5 million, doubling its size from . The expansion plans include 15 private treatment rooms and upgrades to the waiting area, triage room and other areas in the emergency department.

The area around the hospital has many medical office buildings and treatment facilities which provide healthcare to residents living in Mount Vernon, the southeast section of Yonkers, and the north Bronx, which shares a border with the city. For example, Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, the Planned Parenthood affiliate that serves New York&#x27;s Putnam, Rockland, Suffolk and Westchester Counties, opened its first medical center in Mount Vernon in 1935; the affiliate remains a vital source for reproductive health care services to Mount Vernon residents.

===Places of worship===
The city&#x27;s previous motto was &quot;A City That Believes&quot;. This is reflected in the houses of worship in the city that represent more than 25 denominations.

Research has confirmed the tradition that Grace Baptist Church was founded in 1888 by a few women who formerly had been enslaved and it discovered their names: Emily Waller, Matilda Brooks, Helen Claiborne, Sahar Bennett, and Elizabeth Benson.

<text>New Castle is a town in Westchester County, New York, United States. The population was 18,311 in the 2020 United States census, an increase over 17,569 at the 2010 census.

In 1661, John Richbell purchased land, including all of present-day New Castle, from the Siwanoy. In 1696, Caleb Heathcote purchased that tract of land from Richbell&#x27;s widow. What is present-day New Castle was originally incorporated as part of the town of North Castle, which was jokingly referred to as &quot;the two saddlebags,&quot; in 1736. The first European settlers in the area were Quakers, who settled in present-day Chappaqua in 1753 and constructed a meeting house, which still stands today on Quaker Street. The town of New Castle broke away from North Castle in 1791.

<text>New Rochelle ( ; in ) is a city in Westchester County, New York, United States. It is a suburb of New York City, located approximately from Midtown Manhattan. In 2020, the city had a population of 79,726, making it the 7th-largest city and 22nd-most populous municipality in New York. 
==History==
===17th and 18th centuries===

This area was occupied by cultures of indigenous peoples for thousands of years. They made use of the rich resources of Long Island Sound and inland areas.

By the 17th century, the historic Lenape bands, who spoke a language in the Algonquian family, were prominent in the area. Their territory extended from the coastal areas of western present-day Connecticut, Long Island and south through New Jersey, Maryland and Delaware.

In 1654, the Siwanoy Indians, a band of Lenape (also known as the Delaware by English colonists), sold land to English settler Thomas Pell. Some 33 families established the community of &quot;La Nouvelle-Rochelle&quot; () in 1688. Many of them were artisans and craftsmen from La Rochelle, France.

A monument containing the names of these settlers stands in Hudson Park, the original landing point of the Huguenots. In 1689, Pell officially deeded 6,100 acres (25 km2) for the establishment of a Huguenot community.

Jacob Leisler is an important figure in the early histories of both New Rochelle and the United States. He arrived in America as a mercenary in the British Army and later became one of the most prominent merchants in New York. He was subsequently appointed acting-governor of the province; during his tenure he acted on behalf of the Huguenots.

One condition of the sale was that Pell and his heirs would receive &quot;one fatt calfe&quot; on June 24 of every year thereafter, if demanded. The &quot;fatt calfe&quot; was commemorated in the New Rochelle 250th Anniversary half dollar, minted in 1937. Pell&#x27;s descendants did not request a calf until the 1950s. Since then, there have been occasional &quot;fatt calfe&quot; ceremonies.

Of all the Huguenot settlements in America founded with the intention of being distinctly French colonies, New Rochelle most clearly fulfilled such plans. The colony attracted French refugees until as late as 1760, during the French and Indian War in North America between Britain and France.

The settlement was named after La Rochelle, France, where many of the French refugees had come from. The people continued to speak French, and it was common practice for people in neighboring areas to send their children to New Rochelle to learn the language.
In 1775, General George Washington stopped in New Rochelle on his way to assume command of the Army of the United Colonies in Massachusetts. In 1776 the British Army briefly occupied sections of New Rochelle and Larchmont. Following British victory in the Battle of White Plains, New Rochelle became part of a &quot;Neutral Ground&quot; for General Washington to regroup his troops.

After the Revolutionary War ended, in 1784, patriot Thomas Paine was given a farm in New Rochelle for his service to the cause of independence. The farm, totaling about 300 acres (1.2 km2), had been confiscated from its owners by the state of New York due to their Tory activities.

The first national census of 1790 shows New Rochelle with 692 residents. Some 136 were African American, including 36 who were freemen; the remainder were enslaved.

===19th and 20th centuries===
Through the 18th century, New Rochelle had remained a modest village that retained an abundance of agricultural land. During the 19th century, however, New York City was a destination from the mid-century on by waves of immigration, principally from Ireland and Germany. More established American families left New York City and moved into this area. Although the original Huguenot population was rapidly shrinking in relative size, through ownership of land, businesses, banks, and small manufactures, they retained a predominant hold on the political and social life of the town.

The 1820 Census showed 150 African-Americans residing in New Rochelle, six of whom were still enslaved. The state abolished slavery by degrees: children of enslaved mothers were born free, and all enslaved people were freed by 1827.

In 1857 the Village of New Rochelle was established within the borders of the Town of New Rochelle. A group of volunteers created the first fire service in 1861. In 1899, a bill creating the New Rochelle City Charter was signed by Governor Theodore Roosevelt. It was through this bill that the Village and Town of New Rochelle were joined into one municipality. In 1899, Michael J. Dillon narrowly defeated Hugh A. Harmer to become New Rochelle&#x27;s first mayor. The recently established city charter designated a board of aldermen as the legislative unit with two members to be elected from each of four wards and 10 elected from the city at-large.

By 1900, New Rochelle had a population of 14,720. Throughout the city, farms, estates, and wooded homesteads were bought up by realty and development companies. Planned residential neighborhoods such as Rochelle Park, one of the first planned communities in the country, soon spread across the city, earning New Rochelle the sobriquet &quot;City of Homes&quot;. In 1909, Edwin Thanhouser established Thanhouser Film Corporation. Thanhouser&#x27;s &quot;Million Dollar Mystery&quot; was one of the first serial motion pictures. In 1923, New Rochelle resident Anna Jones became the first African-American woman to be admitted to the New York State Bar.

Poet and resident James J. Montague captured the image of New Rochelle at the time in his 1926 poem &quot;Queen City of the Sound&quot;.

In 1930, New Rochelle recorded a population of 54,000, up from 36,213 only ten years earlier. During the 1930s, New Rochelle was the wealthiest city per capita in New York state and the third wealthiest in the country.

By the end of the century, the Metro North railroad station was rebuilt along with a $190 million entertainment complex, nicknamed New Roc City, which featured a 19-screen movie theater, an IMAX theater, an indoor ice-hockey arena, mini-golf, go karts, an arcade, restaurants, a hotel, loft-apartments and a mega supermarket. The complex was built on the site of the former New Rochelle Mall, which had opened in 1968.

===21st century===

In 2014, New Rochelle&#x27;s planning board approved $149 million in developments to three major sections of the city. The developments include restaurants, stores, hotels, an entertainment area, theaters and a mixed-use waterfront area, and are expected to be completed within 10 years. Additional tax breaks ranging in the tens of millions of dollars have since been awarded by the city government to further the redevelopment of the downtown area.
In March 2020, New Rochelle became one of the first reported centers for COVID-19 transmission in New York state during the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak. On March 10, 2020, Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered components of the New York Air National Guard and New York Army National Guard to institute a one-mile radius containment area centered around the Young Israel of New Rochelle synagogue in the Wykagyl section of the City in an attempt to stem the spread of the virus. The implementation of this containment area, which covered multiple neighborhoods in New Rochelle and extended into parts of the neighboring Town of Eastchester, marked the first use in the state of New York of social distancing measures and the closure of schools, houses of worship, and other institutions to combat the spread of the pandemic. Large gathering places including schools and places of worship were declared closed, while National Guard troops were deployed to provide logistical support
such as assistance with the distribution of food and the disinfection of public areas.

===Historic sites===

* Columbia Island – a small island (approx. square) situated between Davids Island and Pea Island. Up until 1940 it was known as Little Pea Island. CBS purchased it and built a concrete foundation to support a transmitter building topped by a tall antenna tower for WCBS-AM. The transmitter remained in operation until the 1960s, when the station was moved to nearby High Island.
* Execution Rocks Lighthouse – centered in the middle of Long Island Sound, just south of Davids Island. The structure was built in 1849 and includes a tall tower and the &#x27;keeper&#x27;s house&#x27;. It is rumored that the lighthouse&#x27;s site got its name before the American Revolutionary War when British colonial authorities executed people by chaining them to the rocks at low tide and allowing the rising water to drown them. In reality, the name was chosen to reflect the historically dangerous shipping area created by the rocks exposure during low tides.
* Huckleberry Island – a island owned by the Huckleberry Indians, Inc., a club within the New York Athletic Club. The island is an important nesting site for waterbirds such as egrets and night herons.
* Leland Castle – a 19th-century Gothic Revival castle built as the summer residence of Simeon Leland, a wealthy New York City hotel entrepreneur. It has since been acquired by the College of New Rochelle and is used as an art gallery available to the public.
* St. John&#x27;s Wilmot Church – a historic Episcopal parish located in the northern end of the City at the intersection of North Avenue and Wilmot Road, formerly referred to as &quot;Cooper&#x27;s Corner&quot;.
* Thomas Paine Historical Site – a historical nexus within the city, the site comprises: the country home of the American pamphleteer and Revolutionary War hero Thomas Paine, his burial site, monument, and a museum. Paine&#x27;s Cottage was built in 1793 and is a National Historic Landmark. The Thomas Paine Memorial Building, built in 1925, houses the library and museum collection of the Thomas Paine National Historical Association. Also on the site is the Brewster Schoolhouse, one of the oldest structural relics in Westchester County.
* Trinity-St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church – added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. It is located at the northwest corner of Huguenot Street (also known as the Boston Post Road) and Division Street. This church represents the body of the majority group of New Rochelle&#x27;s founding Huguenot French Calvinistic congregation that conformed to the liturgy of the established Church of England in June 1709. King George III gave Trinity its first charter in 1762. After the Revolutionary War, Trinity became a parish of the Protestant Episcopal Church of America.

<doc id="127576" wikidata="Q5081062" url="?curid=127576" title="Charles Moose">
<text>Charles Alexander Moose (August 4, 1953 – November 25, 2021) was an American author and police officer. He was the primary official in charge of efforts to apprehend the D.C. snipers in October 2002. During his law enforcement career, Moose served as the chief of police for Montgomery County, Maryland, and Portland, Oregon.

==Early life and education==
Moose was born in New York City on August 4, 1953. His family moved to Lexington, North Carolina, shortly after he was born, and Moose lived and attended school there until leaving for college. When he was sixteen years old, his mother died, and his father died when Moose was in his early twenties. Moose completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in U.S. History in 1975 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. That year he joined the Portland Police Bureau in Portland, Oregon, as a patrolman. He then earned a Master of Public Administration degree from Portland State University in 1984, and a PhD in urban studies and criminology in 1993.

==Career==

===Police executive===
In 1993, Moose became the police chief of the Portland Police Bureau and served as the top law enforcement official for the city until 1999. During his time in Portland he also taught at Portland State University and was a member of the Oregon Air National Guard. He had previously applied for a chief&#x27;s position with the police force in Jackson, Mississippi, but was rejected when they discovered his wife was white. On August 2, 1999, he became the 15th Chief of the Montgomery County Police Department in Maryland, being hired by County Executive Doug Duncan. In October 2002, he was the primary official in charge of the efforts to apprehend those responsible for the D.C. sniper attacks. In June 2003, Moose resigned after a disagreement with Montgomery County regarding a policy that barred him from working on a book and consulting on a movie about the sniper investigation. The book was released in September 2003 and is titled &quot;Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper&quot;. Before the trial, however, Chief Moose engaged in a publicity tour for his book on the sniper investigation, which jeopardized the prosecution. The tour included appearances on &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, the &quot;Today&quot; show, and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Assistant Prince William County Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney James Willett told &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Personally, I don&#x27;t understand why someone who&#x27;s been in law enforcement his whole life would potentially damage our case or compromise a jury pool by doing this.&quot; After his death, County Executive Doug Duncan defended Moose&#x27;s actions, saying he got a &quot;raw deal.&quot;

===Later work===
Until 2005, Moose served as the Squadron Commander of the 113th Security Forces Squadron, D.C. Air National Guard, United States Air Force. While Moose served with that unit, he deployed to Operation Katrina and served as military liaison and adviser to the New Orleans Police Department in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Moose was promoted to lieutenant colonel after arriving in Hawaii and served as the 154th Security Forces Commander there.

Moose later graduated from the Honolulu Police Academy and reported for duty as one of the members of the Honolulu Police Department. On August 4, 2010, &quot;The Gazette&quot; reported that Moose was no longer employed at the department, having left in 2008.

As of September 2012, Moose was retired and living in Tampa, Florida. He applied with the Portland Bureau of Police for the position of chief but was denied.

==Death==
Moose died at his home in Palm Harbor, Florida, on November 25, 2021, at age 68 while watching a football game on TV.

==In popular culture==
*Moose is portrayed by Charles S. Dutton in the 2003 T.V. film &quot;D.C. Sniper: 23 Days of Fear&quot;.

As of the 2020 census, North Salem was recorded as possessing a population of 5,243 people living on a land area of 21.37 square miles.

Founded prior to the American Revolution, North Salem contains an amalgamation of urban and rural features, including parks, forests, lakes, and horse trails alongside commuter train service and an interstate highway. The town has been referred to as &quot;Billionaires&#x27; Dirt Road&quot; due to a number of wealthy residents, although local median household income is not exceptionally high.

==History==

=== Revolutionary Era ===
Prior to the end of the Colonial Era, what would become North Salem and its neighboring town of South Salem were a single municipality, Salem. After the breakout of the American Revolutionary War in 1776, town residents sided with the revolutionary cause.

On September 22, 1780, amidst the war, John Paulding and Isaac Van Wart left from what was later known as the Yerkes Tavern, joined by David Williams. Their expedition resulted in the capture of the British spy Major John André. The foundation of Yerkes (Yerks) Tavern is all that is left of the historic building, once at the intersection of Yerkes Road and Bogtown Road. An historic plaque posted on the site reads:On this site stood one of North Salem&#x27;s early taverns. Its proprietor was John Yerkes, who received a license from the town &quot;to operate a tavern or inn for the accommodation and entertainment of travelers&quot; in 1815.
Early records indicate that this property was owned by the Smith family prior to this date.In late May 1784, soon after the end of the American Revolution, Salem split into two towns. What would become known as North Salem was known as Upper Salem for about four years after the split, until an act of the New York State Legislature in 1788 gave the town its modern name.

=== Nineteenth Century ===
The 1800 United States Census recorded several hundred enslaved individuals being held in North Salem. New York State began operating under a policy of gradual abolition in 1799, with full abolition in 1827; the practice of slavery in North Salem can therefore be estimated to have come to an end sometime between the years 1800 and 1827.

The Great Blizzard of 1888, which impacted communities across the northeastern United States, seriously disrupted agricultural production in North Salem and prevented train movement. It took over a week after the storm to restore roads and trains to operational order.

In 1893, the Titicus Reservoir began serving the New York City water supply. Today, the reservoir is stocked with brown trout each spring and fishing from rowboats is permitted.

=== Modern History ===
In 1932, the North Salem Free Library was established in the North Salem Town House. It was formally chartered by the State of New York in 1952 and later renamed the Ruth Keeler Memorial Library. Its current building was constructed in 1980 and renovated most recently in 2003.

Beginning in the late 1960s, Interstate 684 was constructed through North Salem. When finished in 1974, the new interstate included an exit on Hardscrabble Road.

North Salem&#x27;s Union Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.

In 2015, a small Cessna aircraft crashed into the Titicus Reservoir, killing both passengers.

==Geography==
Putnam County, New York borders North Salem to the north, while the State of Connecticut abuts it to the east. The town itself has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Climatically, the town is in plant hardiness zone 6b on the U.S.D.A. scale, meaning that in extreme circumstances, winter temperature lows could reach .

A geographic curiosity of North Salem is the so-called Standing Rock, a granite boulder sitting on several smaller stones. Since the boulder is not consistent with the geographic surroundings, it has been hypothesized that the rock was deposited by glaciers during the Last Ice Age, although others argue that it may have been moved and placed by Vikings or Native Americans.

==Education==
North Salem Middle School/High School is located on June Road in North Salem. In 2004, the high school was distinguished as a Blue Ribbon School for high levels of educational achievement by the United States Department of Education.

Pequenakonck Elementary School, located away from the middle school/high school, serves grades K-5. The middle school, which shares the same building as the high school, serves grades 6–8. This school is particularly small, with about 90 children on average per grade, making the student to faculty ratio relatively small.

North Salem&#x27;s town government consists of a town supervisor and four town board members. The supervisor serves a two-year term, and the board members serve four-year terms. Elections are staggered such that in any given election year, the supervisor and two board members&#x27; seats will be up for election.

<doc id="127579" wikidata="Q876191" url="?curid=127579" title="Peekskill, New York">
<text>Peekskill is a city in northwestern Westchester County, New York, United States, north of New York City. Established as a village in 1816, it was incorporated as a city in 1940. It lies on a bay along the east side of the Hudson River, across from Jones Point in Rockland County. The population was 25,431 at the 2020 U.S. census, up from 23,583 at the 2010 census. It is the third-largest municipality in northern Westchester County, after Cortlandt and Yorktown.
The area was an early American industrial center, primarily for iron plow and stove products. The Binney &amp; Smith Company, now named Crayola LLC and makers of Crayola products, is linked to the Peekskill Chemical Company founded by Joseph Binney at Annsville in 1864, and succeeded by a partnership by his son Edwin and nephew Harold Smith in 1885. 
The well-publicized Peekskill Riots of 1949 involved attacks and a lynching-in-effigy occasioned by Paul Robeson&#x27;s benefit concerts for the Civil Rights Congress, although the main assault following the September concert properly took place in nearby Van Cortlandtville. Nevertheless, the city of Peekskill has since had multiple African American mayors since 1984.

==History==

===Pre-Revolution===
In September 1609, English explorer Henry Hudson, captain of the &quot;Half Moon&quot;, anchored along the reach of the Hudson River at Peekskill. His first mate noted in the ship&#x27;s log that it was a &quot;very pleasant place to build a town&quot;. After the establishment of the province of New Netherland, New Amsterdam resident Jan Peeck made the first recorded contact with the Lenape people of this area, then identified as &quot;Sachoes&quot;. The date is not certain (possibly early 1640s), but agreements and merchant transactions took place, formalized in the Ryck&#x27;s Patent Deed of April 21, 1685.
 Peekskill&quot; derives from a combination of Peeck&#x27;s surname and the Dutch word for stream, &quot;kil&quot; or &quot;kill&quot;.

==Indian Village of Sachoes==
Not much is currently known about the village of the Sachoes or their origin. It was suggested by city historian Charles Arthur Clark that the grove of tall pine trees that the Sachoes lived amongst were &quot;not a native of this region, so it is believed that Indians must have brought them from somewhere, and planted them. The same may be believed about the cluster of weeping willow trees indicated.&quot;

The last known Sachem (chief) of the Sachoes at the time of the signing of Ryck&#x27;s Patent was named Sirham. 
After trading with Jan Peeck for a considerable amount of the time, the Sachoes began calling the creek where he set up his trading post as &quot;John Peek&#x27;s Creek&quot; and is likely how the city&#x27;s name came to be.

Some early writings regarding the Natives and Peekskill refer to the last Sachem as &quot;Saham.&quot; Other names quoted as the locality now known as Peekskill were Sachus, Sackhoes and Sackock. They are equivalents and refer to the outlet of Magregere&#x27;s Brook and have the same meaning - &quot;at the mouth or outlet of a creek or river.&quot; Their territory extended from this brook to Dickey Brook which runs through Depew Park and Blue Mountain Reservation. Sachus is regarded as the first Sachem of Sachoes. This name can be translated &quot;black kettle&quot;. After the signing of the patent, portions of then Van Cortlandt Manor, north of Magregories brook remained in its wilderness state and the natives roamed the entire section until approximately 1742.

===Appearance in World&#x27;s End===
The Sachoe tribe play a prominent role in World&#x27;s End, a novel by T. C. Boyle which takes place in a fictitious version of Peekskill named Peterskill.

==Fort Independence==
On the north bank of Annsville Creek as it empties into the Hudson, Fort Independence combined with Forts Montgomery and Clinton to defend the Hudson River Valley. Fort Independence was built in August 1776, while Forts Montgomery and Clinton were started in June. Fort Hill Park, the site of Camp Peekskill, contained five barracks and two redoubts.

Settlement was slow in the early 18th century. By the time of the American Revolution, the tiny community was an important manufacturing center, which made it attractive to the Continental Army, which established an outpost here in 1776. Several creeks and streams powered mills, which provided gunpowder, leather, planks, and flour. Slaughterhouses provided fresh meat, easily shipped from docks along the river. Much was needed to support several other forts and garrisons located to support the Hudson River Chains between Bear Mountain Bridge and Anthony&#x27;s Nose during the Revolution to prevent British naval passage upriver.

Though Peekskill&#x27;s terrain and mills were beneficial to the Patriot cause, they also made tempting targets for British raids. The most damaging attack took place in early spring of 1777, when an invasion force of a dozen vessels led by a warship and supported by infantry overwhelmed the American defenders. On leaving New Windsor in June 1781, Washington briefly established his quarters at Peekskill.

==Post-Revolution==

Peekskill&#x27;s first legal incorporation of 1816 was reactivated in 1826 when Village elections took place. The Village was further incorporated within the Town of Cortlandt in 1849 and remained so until separating as a city in 1940.

In 1859, Henry Ward Beecher bought a 36-acre farm at Peekskill. He made many improvements and established a summer home for his family. In 1902, the locally prominent McFadden family bought the property. In 1987, the Beecher-McFadden Estate was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

In August 1949, following reports misquoting Paul Robeson&#x27;s speech to the World Peace Conference in Paris as saying that African Americans would not fight for the United States in any prospective war against the Soviet Union, a planned benefit concert for the Civil Rights Congress in Peekskill was canceled amid White Nationalist and anti-communist violence. An effigy of Robeson was lynched in the town. The artists planned a second concert in nearby Van Cortlandtville on a farm owned by a Holocaust survivor. (His house was subsequently shot into and brickbats thrown through his windows.) The publicity drew a crowd of around 20,000, and two men with rifles were discovered and removed before any violence during the concert. It was one of the earliest performances of Pete Seeger&#x27;s &quot;If I Had a Hammer&quot;; Robeson sang surrounded by union guards and volunteers from the audience as protection against snipers. Afterward, area police and state troopers directed exiting traffic down a single road into an ambush where rocks were thrown through car windows (even at cars with small children). Some were overturned and their occupants beaten without police intervention. These Peekskill Riots were subsequently well-publicized in news reports and folk songs and formed a major event in E.L. Doctorow&#x27;s historical fiction novel &quot;The Book of Daniel&quot;.

Peekskill was the landing point of a fragment of the Peekskill Meteorite, just before midnight on October 9, 1992. At least 16 people recorded the meteoric trail on film. This was only the fourth meteorite in history for which an exact orbit is known. The rock had a mass of and punched through the trunk of a Peekskill resident&#x27;s automobile upon impact.

The &quot;Peekskill Evening Star&quot; and the &quot;Peekskill Highland Democrat&quot; were two of the city&#x27;s daily newspapers through much of the city&#x27;s history. The &quot;Evening Star&quot; published under various mastheads from the 19th century on, and as the &quot;Evening Star&quot; from 1939 until 1985, when the paper folded into what became the nexus of the &quot;Journal News&quot;, a conglomeration of local papers throughout Westchester County. But the &quot;Journal News&quot; focused more on statewide and New York City issues, which led to the founding of the &quot;Peekskill Herald&quot; in 1986. Although numerous prominent citizens came together to try to keep the paper afloat after a series of New York Times articles about the paper&#x27;s foundering fiscal situation, it folded in 2005, replaced by the &quot;Peekskill Daily&quot; in 2009.

The Centennial Firehouse, built in 1890, was under a U.S. Route 9 bridge. During the bridge&#x27;s original construction in 1932, part of the roof of the firehouse was removed. As part of a 2008 highway reconstruction project it was to be relocated to a new historic district. The city spent $150,000 in grant money in preparing the building. Unfortunately a mechanical failure during a turn caused the building to collapse.

In 1984, Richard E. Jackson became Peekskill&#x27;s first African American mayor.

==Geography==
Peekskill is located at (41.2889, −73.9200) in northwestern Westchester County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and (20.99%) is water. The city&#x27;s eastern border is the Town of Cortlandt and its western border is the Hudson River.

<text>Pleasantville is a village in the town of Mount Pleasant, in Westchester County, New York, United States. It is located 30 miles north of Manhattan. The village population was 7,513 at the 2020 census. Pleasantville is home to the secondary campus of Pace University and to the Jacob Burns Film Center. Most of Pleasantville is served by the Pleasantville Union Free School District, with small parts of northern Pleasantville served by the Chappaqua Central School District. The village is also home to the Bedford Road School, Pleasantville Middle School, and Pleasantville High School. The region of Pleasantville commonly referred to as &quot;The Flats&quot; is mostly served by the Mount Pleasant Central School district.

==History==
The settlement of Pleasantville dates back to the Rechgawawank and Sinsink tribes, belonging to the Munsee dialect of the Lenni Lenape. This region of the Hudson Valley has been inhabited since just after the last ice age. Lenape communities practiced ecosystem management, small-scale agriculture, hunting and gathering, democratic politics, and matrilineal governance. Called the “Grandfathers” by neighboring tribes, the Lenape were peaceful and skilled at conflict resolution between tribes and established trading routes crossing through the present-day village before the arrival of Europeans. By the end of the 17th century, most if not all of the New York Lenape people had been killed by disease or conflict or had been displaced westward; Lenape in the 21st century reside in Ontario, Oklahoma, Ohio, Wisconsin, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. French Huguenot Isaac See settled here as an agent for Dutch landowner Frederick Philipse in 1695, beginning the modern settler-colonial history of Pleasantville.

By the time of the American Revolution, the population of the growing settlement comprised English, Dutch, and Quakers, most of whom were tenant farmers. During the Revolution, this area was part of the Neutral Ground, where there were conflicting loyalties among the settlers. British spy Major John André passed through present-day Pleasantville carrying information from Benedict Arnold at Fort Clinton (West Point) to the British in New York City. André lost his bearings near the present-day corner of Bedford Road and Choate Lane and was captured in Tarrytown, New York. The capture of André is often cited as a key factor in the ultimate victory of the American forces.

As the area&#x27;s population grew in the early 19th century, the settlement was called Clark&#x27;s Corners, referring to property owned by Henry Clark at the intersection of Broadway and Bedford Road. This area was the village&#x27;s original commercial center. In the 1820s, the newly appointed postmaster, Henry Romer, was directed by the Postmaster General&#x27;s office in Washington, D.C., to give a name to the post office planned here. Romer&#x27;s proposed name, Clarksville, was rejected because another New York post office already had the name. His second choice, Pleasantville, was accepted, and the Pleasantville Post Office opened on February 29, 1828.

A significant change in the development of Pleasantville came with the arrival of the New York Central Railroad and New York and Harlem Railroad in 1846. In the following year, a train station was built near the present corner of Bedford Road and Wheeler Avenue, and as a result the commercial center of Pleasantville shifted to its current location. The older business district at Bedford Road and Broadway is today called the Old Village. The railroad offered a speedier and more frequent connection with New York City—only 70 minutes away by rail, compared with a five-hour overland journey by stagecoach or a two-hour steamboat trip down the Hudson River. The present-day train station, which currently houses a restaurant, was built in 1905 and was moved to its present location in the 1950s to accommodate the lowering of the tracks below grade. Before the addition of the now heavily trafficked station, commuters working in New York City and lower Westchester County were forced to rely on rides from Marc Damon, now famous in Pleasantville for being &quot;The Friendly Coachman&quot;.

According to several sources, Pleasantville was a stop on the Underground Railroad, a network of safe houses for escaped slaves from the South on their way to freedom in the north.

The latter half of the 19th century was a time of rapid growth in Pleasantville. By the 1870s, there were four shoemaking businesses, a shirtmaking business, and a pickle factory. The first newspaper to serve the village, &quot;The Pleasantville Pioneer&quot;, was launched at about 1886. The village&#x27;s numerous small farms and orchards began to be subdivided for a wave of solid foursquare and Victorian houses built for a growing middle class. The 1890s saw the establishment of a police department, volunteer fire department, and a library system. Pleasantville was incorporated as a village on March 16, 1897.

In the following years, Pleasantville quickly developed into a modern suburb of New York, with a large number of workers commuting between the village and the metropolis on what is now the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line. During the first two decades of the 20th century, roads were paved for the first time, water mains were installed, and electrical wires brought power to the village&#x27;s houses. Other improvements during the first half of the 20th century include the construction of Soldiers and Sailors Field in 1909, the Saw Mill River Parkway in 1924, the Rome Theater in 1925, Memorial Plaza in 1930, Parkway Field in 1930, and Nannahagen Park in 1937 (the adjacent village pool was completed two years later). By the time of World War II, the village had taken on the appearance that it bears today.

Pleasantville merits interest for its literary history. Playwright Lillian Hellman (&quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour,&quot; &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;) bought Hardscrabble Farm on the western outskirts of Pleasantville and lived there in the 1940s and 1950s. For many years author Dashiell Hammett (&quot;The Thin Man,&quot; &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;), with whom Hellman was romantically involved, lived and worked at Hardscrabble Farm. DeWitt Wallace and Lila Bell Wallace, co-founders of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, made Pleasantville their headquarters in 1922, using a converted garage and pony shed on Eastview Avenue as their office and later building a home and larger office space on adjacent property. Subsequently, the &quot;Digest&quot; held office space in several buildings throughout Pleasantville, including the present-day Village Hall at Bedford Road and Wheeler Avenue and, diagonally opposite, the bank building currently occupied by Chase. &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; moved its headquarters to nearby Chappaqua in 1939, but retained its Pleasantville post office box, thus making the name of the village familiar to millions of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; subscribers around the world. Pleasantville is also the home of Joseph Wallace, writer of the novel &quot;Diamond Ruby&quot;. Today Pleasantville is home to many novelists, editors, and writers, who find its easygoing charm and proximity to New York an attractive combination.
Pleasantville&#x27;s reputation as a cultural center was enhanced in 2001 with the opening of the nonprofit Jacob Burns Film Center in the landmark Rome Theater, a Spanish mission-style building and one of the first movie theaters in Westchester County. The Burns Center is dedicated to presenting independent, documentary, and world cinema. Guest speakers at the Burns Center have included Jerry Lewis, Woody Allen, Jonathan Demme, Robert Klein, Oliver Stone, Stephen King, Rob Lowe and numerous other notable filmmakers and actors.

Usonia Homes, a neighborhood of 50 houses spread among of wooded hillside, was started in 1948. Three houses were designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.

Pleasantville is home to the Westchester Table Tennis Center, where over 250 members compete, practice and train for various tournaments, and now, many are even training to become olympic athletes. The Captain Lawrence Brewing Company&#x27;s first brewing location was in Pleasantville.

Another addition to Pleasantville&#x27;s cultural scene is the Pleasantville Music Festival, made possible by the village, over 150 volunteers and WXPK, an all-day outdoor event stage at Parkway Field on the second Saturday in July. Main stage acts have included Roger McGuinn, The Bacon Brothers, Rusted Root, Jakob Dylan, Dar Williams, Carney, Back Door Slam, Marc Cohn, Augustana, Z.Z Ward, and Joan Osborne.

Pleasantville is also home to the Pleasantville Farmers Market. Started in 1998 as one of the first markets in Westchester with a goal of breathing life into a struggling downtown, the Saturday morning market is now the largest year-round farmers market in Westchester County, attracting upwards of 3,500 people a week to shop from about 60 vendors of locally grown and produced food. The market is run by volunteers in the community as a non-profit, and it has won the readers&#x27; choice &quot;Best of Westchester&quot; award from Westchester Magazine for eight consecutive years, since 2014.

From 1975 to 1987, Pleasantville was home to the New York Giants Training Camp. Each summer the Giants would hold their off-season workouts and Training Camp at the Pace University Pleasantville Campus. During their time at Pleasantville, thousands would flock to camp. During their stay in Pleasantville many businesses benefited from the influx of people and many of the players would be seen at many of the restaurants and delicatessens in town.

Pleasantville is also the only place in America to have hosted a royal wedding, between Estelle Bernadotte and Count Folke Bernadotte, a duke of Sweden who rejected his claim to the crown.

The Marmaduke Forster House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

<text>Port Chester is a village in the U.S. state of New York and the largest part of the town of Rye in Westchester County by population. At the 2010 U.S. census, the village had a population of 28,967 and was the fifth-most populous village in New York State. In 2019, its population grew to a census-estimated 29,342 residents. Located in southeast Westchester, Port Chester forms part of the New York City metropolitan statistical area. Port Chester borders Connecticut and the town of Greenwich to the east. It is one of only 12 villages in New York still incorporated under a charter; other villages either incorporated or reincorporated under the provisions of Village Law.

The village of Port Chester is nicknamed the &quot;Gateway to New England&quot; and serves as a transportation hub between New England states and New York. Its economy is primarily stimulated by small businesses, the local government and several national chain stores.

==Names==
The Wappinger people called the land on which the village was founded &quot;Haseco&quot;, meaning &quot;marshy land&quot; or &quot;marshy hassock&quot;. Upon colonial settlement, the area became known as Saw Pit (or Sawpits) for the saw pits in use during the time. Logs were cut in holes in the ground for wood to be used for homesteading. The name Saw Pit was used for the first time in 1732. The village outgrew this name and became Port Chester by incorporating as a village in 1868.

==History==

In 1660, three settlers from Greenwidge (now Greenwich, Connecticut)—Thomas Studwell, John Coe, and Peter Disbrow—arranged to buy Manursing Island and the land near the Byram River from the Native Americans. This First Purchase on Peningo Neck comprised the lower part of the present town of Rye, on the east side of Blind Brook. Over the next decade, additional purchases filled in the shoreline from Rye to Greenwich, made via land agreements with the Native Americans in the area.

These Native Americans&#x27; tribal affiliation has been a source of considerable debate. They may have been small, independent families or tribes, or subgroups of larger tribes in the area. What is documented is the names of the natives who signed land agreements. Their names were written by the English, using their semi-skilled interpretation of the phonetics. In spite of the English phonetic variations, the land records still existent were clearly signed by the same people:

Shawanórõckquot, aka Shanarockwell, aka Shanarocke (and other variations)

Cockho, aka Cokow, aka Cokeo (and other variations)

Cockinsecawa, aka Cokinseco, aka Cockenseco (and other variations)

Kamaque, aka Quaraiko, aka Rawmanquaie (and other variations)

Mehúmõw, aka Maowbert

Shanarocke was referred to by the others as their leader, or &quot;sachem&quot;. These elder tribe members or &quot;sagamores&quot; made many of the tribal decisions, and there were several instances where agreements could not be signed because he was not present.

Shanarocke was a Wiechquaeskeck Native American. Wiechquaskeck settlements were well-documented in shore areas from present-day Pelham to the Byram or &quot;Armonk&quot; river on the Connecticut state line. Shanarocke is specifically named a &quot;Wiechquaskeck sachem&quot; or titled &quot;Sachem of Poningoe&quot; on deeds that include parts of the Bronx and Harlem River area, as well as parts of Queens and Nassau County.

&quot;No Indian name more frequently occurs in the history of the county than that of &quot;Wechquaesgeek&quot;, nor one the precise location of which there is more difficulty in determining. O&#x27;Callaghan says: &#x27;This tract is described as extending from the Hudson to the East river. The name is from &quot;wigwos&quot;, birch bark, and &quot;keag&quot;, country—&#x27;the country of the birch bark.&#x27; Bolton gives the name to an Indian village which occupied the site of Dobbs&#x27; ferry, which he denominates &#x27;the place of the bark kettle.&#x27; 

In &quot;Albany Records&quot;, III, 379, is this entry: &#x27;Personally appeared &quot;Sauwenare&quot;, sachem of Wieckqueskeck, &quot;Amenameck&quot; his brother, and others, all owners, etc., of lands situated on North river called Wieckquaeskeck, and declared that they had sold the same to Wouter Van Twiller in 1645&quot; (source: Ruttenber, Edward Manning, &quot;History of the Indian Tribes of Hudson&#x27;s River: Their Origin, Manners and Customs; Tribal and Sub-Tribal Organizations; Wars, Treaties, Etc., Etc.&quot;, p. 366 (Albany, NY: J. Munsell, 1872). 

Wechqueskeck is not the name of a particular Native American tribe but the name applied to the territorial jurisdiction of a clan of Indians in Westchester County whose principal village was on the headwaters or tributaries of Armonck or Byram&#x27;s River. The later treaties at West Farms and Hunts Point, where Shanarocke is labeled &quot;Sachem of Rye&quot;, hint at his tribal affiliation. On that agreement are also the sachems of the Reckgawawancs.

Recent investigation points to affiliations with the Wappinger, Lenape, Mohawk, Mohegan, and other Westchester County natives. But Native Americans continued to live in Sawpit until their presence was considered a nuisance, a fate befell many Native Americans.

The Saw Pit area remained largely untouched until Revolutionary times except for a few farms in the hills above the Byram River and a few taverns along the trail that became the Boston Post Road. Although Rye and Saw Pit were created within Fairfield County, Connecticut, the King of England gave the Duke of York large territories west of present-day Connecticut, forming the New York Colony in 1683.

The controversy of divided loyalties to the King and the Duke continued for 105 years. In 1788, the Legislature of New York ruled that Saw Pit was a part of the town of Rye, New York. Families from Rye and Greenwich began to settle the Saw Pit area just before the Revolution, but even as late as 1800 there were only a handful of established homesteads.

Early roads in the area grew from native trails. The Boston Post Road, King Street, and Grace Church streets are some of the early migration paths in the Saw Pit/Rye settlement. Water transportation was equally important. The local waterways (the Byram River and Long Island Sound) were a key part of the growth and development of Saw Pit/Port Chester. Early residents took part in farming and fishing. After the Revolution, the harbor area became a shipbuilding site, with the Lyon family operating a considerable shipyard that produced some of the best sloops and seafaring fishing vessels. By the time the village of Saw Pit incorporated as Port Chester, it was considered a major seaport.

The Byram river provided a decent harbor, which became a factor in the industrialization of Port Chester at the beginning of the 19th century. The railroad&#x27;s arrival in 1849 turned Port Chester into a destination for manufacturing and wealthy NYC families, with hotels, theaters, and large estates. These exclusive properties included some of the East Coast&#x27;s grandest mansions, but slowly gave way to the crushing need for housing. Successive waves of immigrants from Germany, Ireland, and Italy each brought industry and prosperity as the village grew.

Steamships regularly sailed from Port Chester to New York City from 1870 until the First World War. The last two decades of the 19th century saw public services expand, and roads were widened and paved in the 1920s. Over 5,000 men from Port Chester served in the First and Second World Wars. After the Second World War, numerous corporations established headquarters or production centers in Port Chester. Examples include Life Savers, whose former factory is now a residential building, evidence of Port Chester&#x27;s progression from an industrial center to a suburban residential municipality.

On June 30, 1974, a nightclub fire killed 24 people. The Gulliver&#x27;s nightclub fire was the deadliest dance club fire in the U.S. in more than a generation (the November 28, 1942, Cocoanut Grove fire in Boston killed 491), and called attention to the dangers of herding young people into windowless underground rooms without smoke alarms, sprinklers, fire-resistant walls, or occupancy limits.

Despite the fire, there was no comprehensive New York State Fire Code reform until the 1980s. Fire code enforcement remains a top priority in Port Chester.

In 1999, the village of Port Chester established a &quot;redevelopment area&quot; and relegated regulatory authority in that area to private developer Gregory Wasser from G&amp;S Port Chester, LLC, including power to condemn private property. The decision spawned several lawsuits, including &quot;Brody v. Village of Port Chester&quot;, &quot;Edward Eways v. Village of Port Chester&quot;, and &quot;Didden v. Village of Port Chester&quot;.

In the late 20th and early 21st century, Port Chester underwent several redevelopment proposals and projects. The Port Chester Historical Society is dedicated to learning and teaching the public about Port Chester&#x27;s history.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has an area of , of which is land and , is water.

Port Chester has a humid subtropical climate (C&quot;fa&quot;). Due to its location on the coast, temperatures are neither extremely cold nor warm, and precipitation is plentiful for the entire year. Winters are usually cool, and powerful nor&#x27;easters can occur, sometimes dropping large amounts of rain and snow on the village. Average annual snowfall is 29.8 inches, significantly more than New York City&#x27;s 25.3. Snow cover is sporadic as the sea moderates temperatures, which melt snow. During the summer, Port Chester is typically warm, but far cooler than towns even a few miles inland, due to the sea&#x27;s influence.

== Education ==
Within the village&#x27;s borders, there is one public school district, the Port Chester-Rye Union Free School District. Established in 1884, it Westchester County&#x27;s oldest school district. Two schools in Port Chester are Port Chester Middle and Port Chester High School.

The Westchester Fairfield Hebrew Academy (now Carmel Academy) opened in Port Chester in 1997, in rented space. It has since moved out of town.

The Japanese Weekend School of New York, a &quot;hoshū jugyō kō&quot; (Japanese weekend school), holds classes at Port Chester Middle School. As of 2006, the school had about 800 students, including Japanese citizens and Japanese Americans, at locations in Westchester County and Long Island.

== Arts and culture ==
The Port Chester-Rye Brook Public Library is an association library funded by and for the villages of Port Chester and Rye Brook. The library was founded in 1876 by Jared V. Peck and was dedicated at its present location in 1926 at the intersection of Haseco and Westchester Avenues. Three major renovations have taken place, in 1967, 2007, and 2012. The latest renovation included the creation of a teen room, a multipurpose meeting room, the addition of new furniture and carpets, and the relocation of the children&#x27;s room and the implementation of an elevator. Although the renovation did not add square footage to the original three-story, 18,900-square-foot building, it provided a more open design, with better use of space and light to promote parent and child reading activities. The 2012 renovations, which cost $1 million, were paid for with the bequest of Douglas and Elise Lefferts. According to 2011 records, 19,900 people hold library cards and 10,221 people attended programs including GED and community interest classes. The summer reading program typically draws 13,000 children.

Another notable cultural landmark in Port Chester is the Capitol Theatre, a music venue that has hosted bands and artists such as The Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, The Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Bob Dylan, and The Ramones. Jerry Garcia of The Grateful Dead said, &quot;There&#x27;s only two theaters, man... that are set up pretty groovy all around for music and for smooth stage changes, good lighting and all that—the Fillmore [in Silver Spring, Maryland] and The Capitol Theatre.&quot; Because of Garcia&#x27;s fondness for the theatre, a section of Port Chester has Grateful Dead-themed adornments on sidewalks and telephone poles and in local businesses. Joplin also wrote her song &quot;Mercedes Benz&quot; outside the Capitol Theatre.

==Government and politics==
Port Chester&#x27;s government comprises a mayor and seven trustees. The board and mayor also employ a professional village manager. The current mayor of Port Chester is Luis Marino (D).

=== Board of trustees ===
*John J Allen Jr. (D)
*Juliana C Alzate (D)
*Joan Grangenois-Thomas (D)
*Bart Didden (C)
*Joseph E. Carvin Jr. (R)
*Philip Dorazio

Stuart L. Rabin serves as village manager.

Local elections in Port Chester occur in March. As part of a 2009 U.S. Justice Department consent decree, Port Chester employed cumulative voting for trustee positions. The decree expired in 2016, and after exploring voting options for elections scheduled for March 2019, Port Chester adopted cumulative voting in its charter by popular referendum in 2018. The mayor continues to be elected at large.

=== Voting ===
To enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the United States Department of Justice brought a lawsuit in 2006 to compel the village government to change from an allegedly racially discriminatory at-large electoral system to one that was district-based. This lawsuit would halt the March 2007 elections until the village developed an acceptable plan. In its December 15, 2006, complaint the Justice Department wrote, &quot;the current at-large system for electing members of the Port Chester Board of Trustees results in Hispanic citizens having less opportunity than white citizens to participate in the political process and to elect candidates of their choice to the Port Chester Board of Trustees.&quot; Local Latino activist Cesar Ruiz, State Assemblyman Peter Rivera, and National Institute for Latino Policy President Angelo Falcón held a news conference on Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s birthday (January 15, 2007) to display support for the Justice Department&#x27;s lawsuit and the need to reform the village&#x27;s electoral system.

The village board of trustees passed a resolution on December 4, 2006, expressing its disagreement with the Department of Justice&#x27;s decision that the village must reform its election system, claiming that the problem was not discrimination but rather &quot;apathy&quot; in the Hispanic community. Federal authorities believed that the village&#x27;s &quot;at large&quot; voting system denied Hispanics representation on the board of trustees and the board of education. According to Reuters, &quot;All voters in town elect each board member, whereas dividing the town into six electoral districts would give Hispanics a majority in at least one of them because they are largely concentrated in one area of town, the suit said.&quot; Although Latinos make up a significant portion of Port Chester&#x27;s population, none had ever been elected to the board of trustees or school board.

On March 2, 2007, federal court judge Stephen C. Robinson ruled in favor of the Department of Justice and placed an injunction on the upcoming trustee elections. This ruling did not affect the mayoral election, but was expected to result in Port Chester being broken into election districts. Instead, village officials came up with an alternative plan to address the problem by using cumulative voting. Robinson approved this plan on November 6, 2009.

===U.S. Post Office===
Port Chester&#x27;s United States Post Office is a historic building on Westchester Avenue. It was designed by consulting architects Zoller and Muller for the Office of the Supervising Architect, built in 1932–1933, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. It is a symmetrical, one-story building faced with brick and trimmed in limestone and granite in the Colonial Revival style. The front facade features a projecting central pavilion with a shallow portico composed of two pairs of limestone Corinthian columns echoed by Corinthian pilasters.

The lobby features an array of four large New Deal murals and nine slightly smaller lunettes, designed by Domenico Mortellito with Treasury Relief Art Project (TRAP) funding and installed in 1936. They depict a wide range of human activities, including firefighting, shipbuilding, baking, iron working, medicine, music, and teaching.

<doc id="127583" wikidata="Q1270755" url="?curid=127583" title="Pound Ridge, New York">
<text>Pound Ridge is a town in Westchester County, New York, United States. The population was 5,082 at the 2020 census. The town is located toward the eastern end of the county, bordered to the north and east by the town of Lewisboro, by Stamford, Connecticut, and New Canaan, Connecticut, to the south, Bedford, New York, and North Castle to the west.

==History==
===Native Americans===
In the early 17th century, Pound Ridge was inhabited by Native Americans who spoke the Munsee language and were members of the Wappinger Confederacy. The geographical boundaries of the tribes within the Confederacy are unclear. Pound Ridge has been variously listed as within the territory of the Kitchawong, Siwanoy, and Tankiteke bands.

The Siwanoy are generally agreed to have lived along the north Long Island Sound Coast with a maximum range extending from Hell Gate to the Five Mile River separating today&#x27;s Darien, Connecticut, from Rowayton to its east. The Tankiteke appear to have occupied easternmost Westchester County above the coast but extending further west in the northern part of the county and into southern and eastern Putnam County, and eastward in Fairfield County to the Saugatuck River in Westport. The territory of the Kitchawong is thought to have extended from the Croton River to Anthony&#x27;s Nose along the Hudson and some distance east from the river.

The Wappinger Confederacy participated in Kieft&#x27;s War which began in 1640 as a result of escalating tensions over land use, livestock control, trade and taxation between the Dutch West India Company colony of New Netherland and neighboring native peoples. In March 1644, a Wappinger Confederacy village in present-day Pound Ridge was attacked by a mixed force of 130 New Netherland soldiers under the command of John Underhill. This event is now known as the Pound Ridge Massacre. The soldiers surrounded and burnt the village in a night attack killing between 500 and 700 Indians. The dead included 25 members of the Wappinger tribe, with the remainder being either Tankiteke or Siwanoy or both. The New Netherland force lost one man killed and 15 wounded. More casualties were suffered in this attack than in any other single incident in the war. Shortly after the battle, four Wappinger Confederacy sachems arrived in the New England settlement of Stamford to sue for peace.

The territory of modern Pound Ridge was first permanently settled by Europeans in 1718 in the present-day Long Ridge Road area. Long Ridge Road was originally an Indian path and had been used by the first settlers of Bedford, New York, as they traveled to that destination from Stamford. Although the very first settlers were from Huntington on Long Island, most of the original settlers of Pound Ridge were from Stamford. A large portion of Pound Ridge was included in the town of North Castle when it was incorporated in 1721.

===Grants and patroons===
Three thousand acres in the northern part of present-day Pound Ridge were included within the more than Cortlandt Manor grant which extended from the Hudson River in the west east to the Connecticut border. A member of the historically prominent Lockwood family first purchased land in Pound Ridge in 1737 and several members of the family settled in the town within the next six years. The Scofield family first settled in the area in 1745 and the first Fancher settled in the area in 1758. Roads in the modern town bear the name of each of these families. The first record of the term &quot;Old Pound Ridge&quot; to refer to the present-day town&#x27;s territory is found in the North Castle records from 1737. &quot;Old Pound Ridge&quot; begins to appear in Stamford records in 1750. The name &quot;Old Pound Ridge&quot; is thought to have originated from the presence of an Indian game pound on a hill within the territory when the settlers first arrived.

During the 1700s, the Boutonville area of Pound Ridge found itself at the center of a 50-year land dispute concerning overlapping grants of the Van Cortlandt Manor grant to Stephanus Van Cortlandt and to the Stamford patentees. After a lengthy legal battle, clear title to the was finally given to Van Cortlandt heirs in 1788. Most of this land is now part of the Ward Pound Ridge Reservation. Sometime after that, Pierre Van Cortlandt built a home there. In 1815, Samuel Piatt (Peatt) (1773–1850) purchased and an existing house from Gen. Philip Van Cortlandt. This home, since demolished, was on what now is Honey Hollow Road. The farmland in the Pound Ridge and Lewisboro sections (Ward Pound Ridge Reservation) were part of the Van Cortlandt Manor lands that were divided into &quot;great lots&quot; of about each. These lots were further divided into farms.

===American Revolutionary War===
Pound Ridge was the site of a battle during the American Revolutionary War. On July 2, 1779, a force of 300 American rebels was attacked by 200 British soldiers under the command of Banastre Tarleton. The raid was the first independent command for the 24-year-old Tarelton. The attack was planned as one of a series of raids on rebel forces in the region, the purpose of which were to draw Washington&#x27;s army away from the Hudson River.

The rebels had been warned of an impending raid on the night of June 30 by the rebel spy Luther Kinnicutt. However, the spy was not able to discover the date of the attack. The American force consisted of 100 continental foot soldiers of the 6th Connecticut Regiment under Major Eli Leavenworth, 90 of Colonel Sheldon&#x27;s 2nd Regiment of Light Horse, and about 100 militia under Major Lockwood. The light horse detachment had been under the temporary command of Major Benjamin Tallmadge until the day before the attack when Colonel Sheldon arrived. Benjamin Tallmadge had organized the Culper Spy Ring which operated in British-occupied New York. The British force consisted of 200 mounted light dragoons and infantry and included some Hessian Jagers.

Tarleton left his base on the Bronx River near Yonkers on the night of July 1 in a heavy rain storm and rode until he reached North Castle early on July 2. He then decided to attack Pound Ridge by an indirect northern route. In this way he managed to avoid the force of continentals located on the southern road. A lookout spotted the British as they approached the town and warned Colonel Sheldon. The commander dispatched Major Tallmadge with a small group to find out if the arriving force were British or expected reinforcements under the command of Colonel Moylan. The force under Tallmadge withdrew upon contact with the British. The force of light horse and militia under Sheldon and Lockwood were scattered and withdrew to the south. Tarleton&#x27;s force pursued them for a time before returning to the town. They were then fired upon by some militia from behind cover. The British burned the Presbyterian Church and the home of Major Lockwood before withdrawing with prisoners, cattle, arms, equipment and the battle standard of Sheldon&#x27;s 2nd Regiment back along the northern road to Bedford. Tarleton had the Presbyterian Church in Bedford burned as well as the house of a patriot. The British abandoned the cattle in Bedford before returning to the Bronx River camp under pursuit by the Americans as far as North Castle. In the course of the raid the British had managed to capture some of Benjamin Tallmadge&#x27;s papers including a letter from George Washington. These papers revealed information on the operations of the Culper Spy Ring.

Reports on battle casualties are contradictory. One secondary source provides a figure of 10 Americans wounded and eight captured along with two British killed and four captured. The nearby towns of Bedford and Norwalk were burned by the British on July 11. Throughout the Revolutionary War, the region was witness to raids by both Patriots and Loyalists against opposing residents. A Loyalist raid in Pound Ridge in 1779 led to the death of a resident. Pound Ridge held a number of Loyalists as prisoners or under house arrest throughout the war. Later in the war Loyalists were denied freedom of speech, lost the use of the courts, were prevented from practicing their trades and had their property confiscated.

===19th century===
Pound Ridge was officially incorporated in 1788. In 1782, the population was 707 which increased to 1,062 by 1790 and 1,256 by 1800. One slave is listed as a resident in the 1800 and 1820 federal censuses. In 1830, the population was 1,437. The population remained between 1,400 and 1,500 through the census of 1860 after which the census indicates population decline. During this period Pound Ridge was an agricultural community in which families raised a variety of crops for their own consumption. Commercial beef and dairy farming were also practiced. The town was a center for shoemaking with almost 150 families listed as shoemakers. Shoe parts were acquired from factories in Long Ridge and New Canaan. Residents would then stitch, fit and attach the parts and return the completed shoes to the factories. This activity was greatest in the winter during which farmers had the time to pursue secondary occupations. This cottage industry declined as the shoemaking industry began to employ full-time workers around mid-century. As a result, a number of local shoemakers moved out of town to become factory workers. Pound Ridge became a center of basketmaking with 80 families employed in the trade at its peak. Basketmaking was concentrated in the present-day hamlet of Scotts Corners which was known as Basket Town. Baskets were used for a variety of purposes but were particularly important for the oyster industry along the Long Island Sound. This local industry reached its height in the 1860s, with basket prices falling thereafter. The decline of basketmaking in Pound Ridge was caused by a combination of competition from foreign and machine-made products as well as the collapse of the oyster industry in the Sound due to environmental pollution.
Pound Ridge furnished 109 men to fight in the American Civil War. Of the 94 new recruits, 53 served in Connecticut regiments and 41 in New York Regiments. Seven men were killed in action, 13 died of disease, three died in prison, seven were wounded and 13 disabled. When conscription was enacted, the town began to raise money to give to conscripts for their personal use or so that they could purchase substitutes. The money was raised through taxes, bonds and loans from the county. By the end of the war the town had $35,000 in debts. A significant portion of the money was entrusted to Alsop Hunt Lockwood who served as the town supervisor from 1844 to 1853 and then county sheriff for three years before becoming supervisor again from 1856 to 1868. In the spring of 1868, the town attempted to audit the supervisor to determine how the war funds were disbursed. The supervisor resigned in the summer of 1868 and the town went to court against him to recover $9,155.77 in damages and costs. The case was apparently settled out of court. The former supervisor sold his Pound Ridge house in 1871 and moved to White Plains where he died three years later. Alsop was the sixth and last member of the Lockwood family to serve as town supervisor.

In 1869, the Stamford Water Company purchased land for the construction of a dam and the creation of a reservoir for the use of the city of Stamford. Three ponds were joined to create Trinity Lake which reached a capacity of 450 million gallons when the dam height was increased in 1895. In 1891, the Stamford Water Company purchased additional land and created Siscowit Reservoir with a capacity of 88 million gallons. Annual farmers&#x27; picnics were held on the eastern shore of Trinity Lake for about 20 years from 1886 onwards. Up to 2,000 people from the region would attend.

===20th century===
The population of Pound Ridge declined from 1,417 in 1860 to a low of 515 in 1920. During this period general farming was replaced by dairy farming. Forest grew back over land cleared during the previous two centuries. The town had lost all three of its post offices by 1903. In May 1911, a series of fires broke out that burned hundreds of acres. George Irving Ruscoe served as town supervisor from 1894 to 1927. He also served as a justice of the peace for 62 years until his retirement in 1945. In 1916, the Northern Westchester District Nursing Association requested permission to open a Polio hospital in Pound Ridge. Sentiment in the town was strongly against the proposal and the hospital was not approved. The town board passed a resolution requiring all outside children under the age of 17 to be examined by health officials before they would be allowed to visit the town. In 1917, Pound Ridge was caught up in a Polio epidemic.

In 1925, Westchester County purchased over of land in northern Pound Ridge and adjacent Lewisboro to create the Pound Ridge Reservation. The park was renamed the Ward-Pound Ridge Reservation in 1938 after the park planner and longtime Republican county leader William L. Ward. From 1933 to 1940, the Reservation was host to a Civilian Conservation Corp camp known variously as Camp SP-9, Camp No. 24 and Camp Merkel after the parks superintendent for Westchester County. The camp had about 200 enrollees at any one time. Workers improved roads and built bridges, planted trees and constructed shelters, picnic areas, walls, latrines and a museum.

<text>Rye Brook is a village in Westchester County, New York, United States, within the town of Rye. The population was 9,347 at the 2010 census.

Rye Brook has been designated as a Tree City USA for 14 years.

==History==
Rye Brook is located in southeastern Westchester County and shares its eastern border with Greenwich, Connecticut. The village was an unincorporated section of the town of Rye until its incorporation as a village on July 7, 1982.

In 1982, 150 residents of the unincorporated area proposed to establish the village of Rye Brook and organized a petition containing 1,536 signatures. The petition drive, which contained the signatures of approximately 36% of the registered voters in the unincorporated area, was organized by the Independent Civic Association. It was reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot; that one resident commented, &quot;There is a time for a community to redefine itself,&quot; further stating that residents of the unincorporated area &quot;should be able to elect their own officers&quot; and &quot;protect their tax base.&quot;

The residents of the unincorporated area voted on June 23, 1982, to create the Village of Rye Brook. It was the first village created in New York State in 54 years. The referendum to create the new political identity passed with 58% of the voters in favor (1,991 to 1,434). The first election in the Village&#x27;s history was held to elect a mayor and four trustees. The first village official was Lee Russillo, who was sworn in as Rye Brook&#x27;s first Village Clerk, and was responsible for the first election day.

The village is home to the William E. Ward House, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Also known as Ward&#x27;s Castle, it was the home of the National Cartoon Museum, established by Mort Walker, the creator of Beetle Bailey, from 1976 to 1992.

<text>Somers is a town located in northern Westchester County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town had a population of 21,541. The nearby Metro-North Commuter Railroad provides service to Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan with an average commute time of 65 to 75 minutes from stations at Purdys, Goldens Bridge, Croton Falls, and Katonah.

==History==
Somers was originally inhabited by Native Americans known as Kitchawanks, part of the Wappinger tribe, an Algonquian people who called the land &quot;Amapaugh&quot;, meaning &quot;fresh water fish.&quot; This land was located in the eastern segment of an tract King William III of England granted to Stephanus Van Cortlandt of New York City in 1697. The part of Van Cortlandt Manor that ultimately became Somers and Yorktown was known as the Middle District, or Hanover.

European settlement in the New Oltenia area began after Van Cortlandt&#x27;s death in 1700 and the final partition of his estate in 1734. Early European settlers included tenants and freeholders from neighboring areas, among them English, Dutch, French Huguenots and Quakers. At the first known town meeting of European settlers held on March 7, 1788, at an inn owned by Benjamin Green, the town named Stephentown was established. However, there already existed a Stephentown in Rensselaer County. To alleviate confusion, the name was changed in 1808 to Somers to honor Richard Somers, a naval captain from New Jersey who died in combat during the First Barbary War. A memorial in West Somers Park was erected in his honor at Memorial Day ceremonies in 1958.

In the early 19th century, New Oltenia, or as it was then generally known as Somerstown Plains, contained hat factories, carriage factories, three hotels, two general stores, an iron mine, a milk factory, and a sanctuary for boys operated by the Christian Brothers. Today, the facility is known as Lincoln Hall, and houses incarcerated teens. There was a constant stream of goods and passengers to large markets and cities through the village. As early as 1809, a weekly newspaper was established, the &quot;Somers Museum and Westchester County Advertiser&quot;. Though primarily agricultural, the rural economy also supported a varied population of weavers, preachers, merchants, cabinetmakers, doctors, lawyers, teachers and servants. A good system of roads was maintained and some operated as commercial &quot;toll roads&quot;. The railroad, developed in the 1840s, bypassed the town of Somers, and affected a decline in growth over the next hundred years. The presence of the railroad in nearby communities did allow the agricultural emphasis to move towards dairy production and fruit growing, since the products could be shipped to markets in the city.

Industries continued to thrive, with grist, paper, saw and clothing mills operating in the area. Between 1890 and 1910, the Croton and Muscoot rivers were flooded to create the New York City reservoir system thereby changing the local landscape considerably. In the 1920s small lake communities began to spring up as vacation havens for summer visitors and farmers’ guests. These lake communities became larger and firmly established, eventually evolving from seasonal to year-round neighborhoods now known as Lake Lincolndale, Lake Purdys and Lake Shenorock. Following World War II, the rural countryside of Somers continued attracting &quot;weekenders&quot;, many from New York City who became more mobile because of the proliferation of automobile travel. The construction of Interstate 684 in the mid-1970s facilitated a resurgence of residential and commercial development in Somers for the next 20 years. Somers grew most rapidly during the 1980s and 1990s, after IBM and PepsiCo built large corporate facilities within it.

Somers is known for being the &quot;cradle of the American circus&quot;. It gained this notoriety after Hachaliah Bailey bought an African elephant, which he named &quot;Old Bet&quot;. Somers was in a minor dispute with Baraboo, Wisconsin, over which community is the &quot;birthplace&quot; of the American circus. Bailey intended to use the elephant for farm work, but the number of people it attracted caused Bailey to take her throughout the Northeast. Bailey&#x27;s success caused numerous others to tour with exotic animals, and during the 1830s the old-style circus and Bailey&#x27;s attractions merged to form the modern circus. Old Bet died on tour in 1827. Bailey later erected the Elephant Hotel in Somers in honor of Old Bet, and it was purchased by the town in 1927. It is a town landmark and in 2006 was dedicated a National Historic Landmark. The elephant remains a symbol of the town to this day, with the high school sports teams nicknamed &quot;Tuskers&quot;. The Elephant Hotel is currently the Somers Town Hall.

The Mount Zion Methodist Church, Gerard Crane House, Elephant Hotel, Somers Business Historic Preservation District, Bridge L-158 and West Somers Methodist Episcopal Church and Cemetery are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
