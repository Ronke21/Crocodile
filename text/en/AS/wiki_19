<text>Erotomania, also known as de Clérambault&#x27;s syndrome, is a relatively uncommon paranoid condition that is characterized by an individual&#x27;s delusions of another person being infatuated with them. It is listed in the DSM-5 as a subtype of a delusional disorder. Commonly, the onset of erotomania is sudden, and the course is chronic.

This disorder is most often seen (though not exclusively) in female patients who are shy, dependent, and sexually inexperienced. The object of the delusion is typically a male who is unattainable due to high social or financial status, marriage, or lack of interest. The object of obsession may also be imaginary, deceased, or someone the patient has never met. Delusions of reference are common, as the erotomanic individual often perceives that they are being sent messages from the secret admirer through innocuous events such as seeing license plates from specific regions.

==Symptoms==
The core symptom of erotomania is that the individual holds an unshakable belief that another person is secretly in love with them. In some cases, the person with the condition may believe several people at once are &quot;secret admirers&quot;. Most commonly, the individual has delusions of being loved by an unattainable person who is usually an acquaintance or someone the person has never met. They may also experience other types of delusions concurrently with erotomania, such as delusions of reference, wherein the perceived admirer secretly communicates their love by subtle methods such as body posture, arrangement of household objects, colors, numbers, license plates on cars from specific states and other seemingly innocuous or, if the person is a public figure, through clues in the media such as coded social media posts and meaningful clothing choices. Some delusions may be extreme such as the conception, birth, and kidnapping of children that never existed or the belief that the individual was predestined or chosen by God to be with the object of their obsession. The delusional objects may be replaced by others over time, and some may be chronic in fixed forms. Denial is characteristic with this disorder as the patients do not accept the fact that their object of delusion may be married, unavailable, or uninterested. The phantom lover may also be imaginary or deceased.

Erotomania has two forms: primary and secondary. Primary erotomania is also commonly referred to as de Clerambault&#x27;s syndrome and old maid&#x27;s insanity and it exists alone without comorbidities, has a sudden onset and a chronic outcome. The secondary form is found along with mental disorders like paranoid schizophrenia, often includes persecutory delusions, hallucinations, and grandiose ideas, and has a more gradual onset. Patients with a &quot;fixed&quot; condition are more seriously ill with constant delusions and are less responsive to treatment. These individuals are usually timid, dependent women that are often sexually or socially inexperienced. In those with a more mild, recurrent condition, delusions are shorter-lived and the disorder can exist undetected by others for years. Problematic behaviors include actions like calling and texting, sending letters and unwanted gifts, persistent internet harassment via social media and email, making unannounced house visits, contacting or attempting to contact the individuals friends, family or co-workers and other persistent stalking behaviors.

==Cause==
Erotomania may present as a primary mental disorder, or as a symptom of another psychiatric illness. With secondary erotomania, the erotomanic delusions are due to other mental disorders such as bipolar I disorder or schizophrenia. Symptoms may also be precipitated by alcoholism, substance abuse (including cannabis use) and the use of antidepressants. There may be a potential genetic component involved as family histories of first degree relatives (parents, siblings) with histories of psychiatric disorders and/or dementia are common. The disorder also has behavioral similarities to early onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (mood swings, poor judgement, confusion, hallucinations). Sigmund Freud explained erotomania as a defense mechanism to ward off homosexual impulses which can lead to strong feelings of paranoia, denial, displacement and projection. Similarly, it has been explained as a way to cope with severe loneliness or ego deficit following a major loss. Erotomania may also be linked to unsatiated urges dealing with homosexuality or narcissism. Some research shows brain abnormalities occurring in patients with erotomania such as heightened temporal lobe asymmetry and greater volumes of lateral ventricles than those with no mental disorders.

==Treatment==
Prognosis differs from person to person, and the ideal treatment is not completely understood. Treatment for this disorder gains the best results when tailored specifically for each individual. To date, the mainline pharmacological treatments have been pimozide (a typical antipsychotic which was also approved for treating Tourette&#x27;s syndrome), and atypical antipsychotics like risperidone and clozapine. Non-pharmacologic treatments that have shown some degree of efficacy are electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), supportive psychotherapy, family and environment therapy, rehousing, risk management and treating underlying disorders in cases of secondary erotomania. ECT may provide temporary remission of delusional beliefs; antipsychotics help attenuate delusions and reduce agitation or associated dangerous behaviors, and SSRIs may be used to treat secondary depression. In delusional disorder there is some evidence that pimozide has superior efficacy compared with other antipsychotics. Psychosocial psychiatric interventions can enhance the quality of life through allowing some social functioning, and treating comorbid disorders is a priority for secondary erotomania. Family therapy, adjustment of socio-environmental factors, and replacing delusions with something positive may be beneficial to all. In most cases, harsh confrontation should be avoided. Structured risk assessment helps to manage risky behaviors in those individuals more likely to engage in actions that include violence, stalking, and crime. For particularly troublesome cases, neuroleptics and enforced separation may be moderately effective.

==History==

Early references to the condition can be found in the work of Hippocrates, Freud (1911), French psychiatrist Gaëtan Gatian de Clérambault (1942), Erasistratus, Plutarch and Galen. Parisian physician, Bartholomy Pardoux (1545-1611) covered the topics of nymphomania and erotomania. In 1623, erotomania was referred to in a treatise by Jacques Ferrand (Maladie d&#x27;amour ou Mélancolie érotique) and has been called &quot;erotic paranoia&quot; and &quot;erotic self-referent delusion&quot; until the common usage of the terms erotomania and de Clérambault&#x27;s syndrome. In 1971 and 1977, M.V. Seeman referred to the disorder as &quot;phantom lover syndrome&quot; and &quot;psychotic erotic transference reaction and delusional loving&quot;. Emil Kraepelin and Bernard also wrote of erotomania and more recently, Winokur, Kendler, and Munro have contributed to knowledge on the disorder.

G. E. Berrios and N. Kennedy outlined in &quot;Erotomania: a conceptual history&quot; (2002) several periods of history through which the definition of erotomania has changed considerably:
*Classical times – early eighteenth century: General disease caused by unrequited love
*Early eighteenth-beginning of nineteenth century: Practise of excess physical love (akin to nymphomania or satyriasis)
*Early nineteenth century – beginning twentieth century: Unrequited love as a form of mental disease
*Early twentieth century – present: Delusional belief of &quot;being loved by someone else&quot;

In one case, erotomania was reported in a patient who had undergone surgery for a ruptured cerebral aneurysm.

==Well-known cases==
In his paper that described the syndrome, de Clérambault referenced a patient he had counselled who was obsessed with British monarch George V. She had stood outside Buckingham Palace for hours at a time, believing that the king was communicating his desire for her by moving the curtains. Parallels were drawn between this and a 2011 case where the body of a homeless American man was found on a secluded island in St James Park, within sight of Buckingham Palace. The man had sent hundreds of &quot;strange and offensive&quot; packages to Queen Elizabeth II over the previous fifteen years. 

The attempted assassination of United States president Ronald Reagan by John Hinckley Jr. has been reported to have been driven by an erotomaniac fixation on actress Jodie Foster, whom Hinckley was attempting to impress.

Late-night TV entertainer David Letterman and former astronaut Story Musgrave were both stalked by Margaret Mary Ray, who had erotomania.

Michael David Barrett allegedly had erotomania, stalking ESPN correspondent Erin Andrews across the country, trying to see her and taking lewd videos.

Many cases of obsession or stalking can be linked to erotomania but do not always necessarily go hand in hand.

<doc id="127590" wikidata="Q190155" url="?curid=127590" title="Van Halen">
<text>Van Halen ( ) was an American rock band formed in Pasadena, California, in 1973. Credited with restoring hard rock to the forefront of the music scene, Van Halen was known for their energetic live performances and the virtuosity of their guitarist, Eddie Van Halen.

From 1974 to 1985, Van Halen consisted of Eddie Van Halen, his brother, drummer Alex Van Halen, lead vocalist David Lee Roth, and bassist Michael Anthony. Upon its release in 1978, the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album reached No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and would sell over 10 million copies in the United States, achieving a Diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). By 1982, the band had released four more albums: &quot;Van Halen II&quot; (1979), &quot;Women and Children First&quot; (1980), &quot;Fair Warning&quot; (1981), and &quot;Diver Down&quot; (1982), all of which have since been certified multi-platinum. By the early 1980s, Van Halen was among the most commercially successful rock acts. The album &quot;1984&quot;, released in the eponymous year, was a commercial success with U.S. sales of 10 million copies and four successful singles. Its lead single, &quot;Jump&quot;, was the band&#x27;s only number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 1985, Roth left the band to embark on a solo career and was replaced by former Montrose lead vocalist Sammy Hagar. With Hagar, the group released four U.S. number-one, multi-platinum albums over the course of 11 years: &quot;5150&quot; in 1986, &quot;OU812&quot; in 1988, &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot; in 1991, and &quot;Balance&quot; in 1995. The group also released a double-platinum live album, &quot;&quot;, in 1993. Hagar left the band in 1996 shortly before the release of the band&#x27;s first greatest hits collection, &quot;Best Of – Volume I&quot;. Former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone replaced Hagar and recorded the commercially unsuccessful album &quot;Van Halen III&quot; with the band in 1998, before parting ways in 1999. Van Halen then went on hiatus until reuniting with Hagar in 2003 for a worldwide tour in 2004 and the double-disc greatest hits collection, &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; (2004). Hagar again left Van Halen in 2005. Roth returned in 2006, but Anthony was replaced on bass guitar by Eddie&#x27;s son, Wolfgang Van Halen. In 2012, the band released their final studio album, &quot;A Different Kind of Truth&quot;, which was critically and commercially successful. It was also the band&#x27;s first album with Roth in 28 years and the only one to feature Wolfgang. Eddie was diagnosed with cancer in 2001, and died of the disease on October 6, 2020. A month after his father&#x27;s death, Wolfgang confirmed that Van Halen had disbanded.

, Van Halen is 20th on the RIAA&#x27;s list of best-selling artists in the United States; the band has sold 56 million albums in the U.S. and more than 80 million worldwide, making them one of the best-selling groups of all time. , Van Halen is one of only five rock bands with two studio albums to sell more than 10 million copies in the United States and is tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American band. Additionally, Van Halen has charted 13 number-one hits on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Mainstream Rock chart. VH1 ranked the band seventh on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Hard Rock Artists&quot;.

==History==
===1972–1977: Formation and early history===
The Van Halen brothers were born in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Alex Van Halen in 1953 and Eddie Van Halen in 1955, sons to Dutch musician Jan Van Halen and Indonesian-born Indo Eugenia Van Beers. The family moved to Pasadena, California, in 1962. Young Edward began learning classical piano by ear, and became so proficient he won an annual piano recital contest 2 or 3 years in a row, despite never mastering sight-reading sheet music. The brothers began playing music together in the 1960s, with Eddie on drums and Alex on guitar. However, while Ed was delivering newspapers to pay off his drum set, Alex secretly developed a passion and proficiency at them. Eventually, out of frustration and brotherly competition, Ed told Alex, &quot;OK, you play drums and I&#x27;ll play your guitar.&quot;

The Van Halen brothers formed their first band, the Broken Combs, in 1964. As they gained popularity playing backyard parties and local high school functions, they changed their name first to the Trojan Rubber Co, then in 1972 to Genesis, later still to Mammoth when they discovered Genesis was already in use by a major-label British band. At this time the band included Eddie on both vocals and lead guitar and friend Mark Stone on bass. They rented a sound-system from Indiana-born Pasadena transplant David Lee Roth for $10 per night. The loquacious, worldly, energetic son of a local ophthalmologist, Roth fronted a local R&amp;B influenced rock band the Red Ball Jets. Roth&#x27;s uncle Manny owned NYC&#x27;s Bleecker street Cafe Wha? until 1968. Partly to save money, they now invited Roth to join as their lead vocalist despite previous unconvincing audition(s). Ultimately Roth&#x27;s charismatic &quot;Jim Dandy&quot; approach would be both an artistic foil to Eddie&#x27;s circumspect, guitar prodigy talents as well as allowing Eddie to focus his energies on song composition.
In 1973, Mammoth officially changed its name to Van Halen. According to Roth, this was his brainchild. He felt it was a name that held long-term identity, artistic and marketing advantages, like Santana. They continued to play Pasadena, San Bernardino, and Venice at clubs, festivals, backyard parties and city parks like Hamilton, drawing up to 2,000 people. Traffic jams and noise complaints to the local police often ensued, as far away as San Pedro. Van Halen subsequently played clubs in Los Angeles and West Hollywood to growing audiences, increasing their popularity entirely through self-promotion, passing out flyers at local high schools. This tenacious self-promotion soon built them an auspicious, loyal, area following. 

By 1974, Roth had been in the band for about a year, and they decided to replace the ambivalent Stone, who was unsure about a career in music. Michael Anthony Sobolewski, a Pasadena college music-classmate of Eddie&#x27;s, joined the group after an all-night jam session. He had sung and played bass in a number of less successful Arcadia backyard-party bands, including Snake. Although he was hesitant, his bandmate in Snake encouraged him to seize this opportunity. Also in 1974, the band had a major break when it was hired to play regularly at the Sunset Strip club Gazzarri&#x27;s. The Doors had also &quot;broken&quot; there in the late 1960s. Owner Bill Gazzarri had previously claimed Van Halen was too loud for the venue. However, their new managers, Mark Algorri and Mario Miranda, took over the club&#x27;s hiring and booked them through 1976. By the Spring of 1975, they were also the regular Tuesday night band at Myron&#x27;s Ballroom. They had succeeded in becoming a staple of the Los Angeles music scene during the mid-1970s, playing at well-known clubs like the Whisky a Go Go on Sunset Strip.

All the club gig success led naturally to the need for a demo tape, which was recorded at Cherokee Studios in Northridge where Steely Dan had recently completed an LP. According to a January 4, 1977, &quot;L.A. Times&quot; article by Robert Hilburn, entitled &quot;HOMEGROWN PUNK&quot;, Rodney Bingenheimer saw Van Halen at Gazzarri&#x27;s in the summer of 1976, and enticed Gene Simmons of Kiss to see them. Impressed to action, Simmons produced a 29-track Van Halen demo tape, entitled &quot;Zero&quot; at Village Recorder studios in Los Angeles and with post-production overdubs completed at Electric Lady Studios in New York. Simmons even suggested changing their name to &quot;Daddy Longlegs.&quot; However, a very disappointed Simmons could do no more once Kiss management opined that Van Halen &quot;had no chance of making it&quot;.

Doug Messenger, Van Morrison&#x27;s band leader guitarist, knowing that Ted Templeman was looking for a &quot;guitar hero&quot; act, had seen Van Halen at the Starwood in Hollywood and placed a number of calls to Warner Records for Ted to check them out. &quot;I don&#x27;t know if it was 4 calls or 10, but I knew this was exactly the act Ted wanted. So on a horrendously rainy night in mid-1977&quot;, Warner Bros. executive Mo Ostin and producer Ted Templeman saw Van Halen perform at the Starwood in Hollywood. According to a December 1977 story in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, it was Van Halen&#x27;s first booking at the Starwood and the first time they hired their own roadies. &quot;We wanted to come on with a little class and we couldn&#x27;t be seen setting up our own stuff in Hollywood,&quot; explained Roth. Although the audience was negligible – Messenger claims only a barmaid and himself were there until Ostin and Templeman arrived – the Warner Bros. reps were so impressed that they wrote a letter of intent on a napkin, and within a week met at a local diner with the band, their future manager Marshall Berle (nephew of comedian Milton Berle) and Warner touring manager Noel Monk, who had just guided the Sex Pistols across the United States. According to Noel Monk&#x27;s book, the band&#x27;s car had broken down enroute to the meeting at the diner, and rather than leave the Warner Bros. reps waiting and appear to be an irresponsible band, the members of Van Halen actually ran the remaining distance of several miles to arrive only slightly late . Warner offered the band a rather basic two album recording contract, one that heavily favored Warner, paying the four young men only $0.70 per unit (album) sold, a deal that would leave the band over $1 million in debt at the conclusion of their first supporting tour as the opening act for Journey and Ronnie Montrose. The group recorded their debut album at Sunset Sound Recorders studio from mid-September to early October 1977, recording guitar parts for one week and then vocals for two additional. All of the tracks were laid down with little overdubbing or multi-tracking. Minor mistakes were purposely left on the record and a very rudimentary instrument set-up was used to give the record a live feel. During this time, they continued to play various venues in Southern California, including some notable concerts at the Pasadena Convention Center produced by their promoter and impresario, Steve Tortomasi, himself a fixture in the local rock and roll scene.

Upon its release, &quot;Van Halen&quot; reached No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop music charts, one of rock&#x27;s most commercially successful debuts. It was highly regarded as both a heavy metal and hard rock album. The album included songs now regarded as Van Halen classics, like &quot;Runnin&#x27; with the Devil&quot; and the guitar solo &quot;Eruption&quot;, which showcased Eddie&#x27;s use of a technique known as &quot;finger-tapping&quot;, leading into what became the band&#x27;s first single, a cover of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;. The band toured for 9 months more, opening for Black Sabbath and establishing a reputation for their performances. The band&#x27;s chemistry was based on Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s guitar technique and David Lee Roth&#x27;s charisma. The band returned to the studio for 2 weeks, in late 1978, to record &quot;Van Halen II&quot;, a 1979 LP similar in style to their debut. This record yielded the band&#x27;s first hit single, &quot;Dance the Night Away&quot;, which peaked at 15 on BB Hot 100.

Over the next four years, the band toured non-stop, never taking more than 2 weeks to record an album. Their album &quot;Women and Children First&quot; was released in 1980, and further cemented Van Halen&#x27;s platinum-selling status to Warner Bros. It yielded two hit singles, &quot;And the Cradle Will Rock...&quot; and &quot;Everybody Wants Some!!&quot;. For the first time, an amplified Wurlitzer electric piano was used to complement Ed&#x27;s guitar.

In 1981, during the recording of &quot;Fair Warning&quot;, Eddie&#x27;s desire for darker, more complex songs in minor keys was at odds with Roth&#x27;s pop tastes and style. Nonetheless, Roth and veteran Warner Bros. rock producer Ted Templeman acquiesced to Eddie&#x27;s wishes on this album. Doug Messenger recalled how Ed and engineer Don Landee rerecorded the &quot;Unchained&quot; solo hours after Ted &quot;stormed out of&quot; the studio. This darker album only reached platinum status after $250,000 of payola pushed it up nationwide from 400k copies.

Planning to release a cover single, then take a hiatus, Roth and Ed agreed upon a remake of the 1960s Roy Orbison song &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot;, which peaked at 12 on BB Top 100. &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot;&#x27;s comical video helped its immediate success, but was also banned by MTV. Due to much pressure from Warner Bros., the hiatus was canceled and the &quot;Diver Down&quot; LP was squeezed out, again, within 2 weeks time. Roth&#x27;s preference for pop covers prevailed this time and with Ed&#x27;s synthesizer and guitar riffs &quot;Diver Down&quot; charted much better. The band then earned a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records for the highest-paid single appearance of a band: $1.5 million for a 90-minute set at Steve Wozniak&#x27;s 1983 US Festival, a show that both Noel Monk and Doug Messenger considered artistically a disaster, Roth having consumed alcohol to the point of forgetting lyrics. Despite this return to form, Roth and Eddie&#x27;s differences continued, and this caused friction with other band members. Billy Sheehan, after his band Talas completed a tour with Van Halen, claims he was approached by Eddie to replace Michael Anthony; the reasons for this were never completely clear to Sheehan, as nothing came of it. During this time, Eddie contributed the score and instrumental songs to the movie &quot;The Wild Life&quot;. The score was laden with drum machine and hinted at sounds and riffs that would come with their next two albums, &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;5150&quot;.

&quot;1984&quot; (released on January 9, 1984) was a commercial success, going five-times platinum after a year of release. Recorded at Eddie&#x27;s newly built 5150 Studios, the album featured keyboards, which had only been used sporadically on previous albums. The lead single, &quot;Jump&quot;, featured a synthesizer hook and anthemic lyrics inspired by news coverage of a suicidal jumper. It became the band&#x27;s first and only No. 1 pop hit with Roth, garnering them a Grammy nomination. 
Other singles included &quot;Panama&quot; (No. 13 U.S.), &quot;I&#x27;ll Wait&quot; (also No. 13 U.S.), and &quot;Hot for Teacher&quot;. Three of the songs had popular music videos on MTV. &quot;1984&quot; was praised by critics and peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts behind Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; (which notably had a guitar solo by Eddie on &quot;Beat It&quot;).

Following the &quot;1984 Tour,&quot; Roth decided to quit and form a new band. Group members have given different reasons for the split, but all were firmly rooted in control of the band&#x27;s sound, artistic direction, singles released and pace. Roth was concerned about Eddie playing music outside of Van Halen. Roth was also launching a successful solo career with two hit cover songs off his &quot;Crazy from the Heat&quot; EP, a remake of the Beach Boys&#x27; classic &quot;California Girls&quot; (#3 U.S.) and a pairing of the classic Al Jolson standard &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot; and &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Got Nobody&quot;(#12 U.S.), which had previously been paired together by Louis Prima. Roth was also offered a $20-million film deal for a script titled &quot;Crazy from the Heat&quot;. Roth hoped Van Halen would contribute the soundtrack; however, the film deal fell through when CBS Pictures was reorganized in 1986.

===1985–1996: Sammy Hagar era===

Eddie invited Patty Smyth of Scandal to replace Roth, but she declined. Daryl Hall was also offered the lead vocal position in 1985, but also declined. Hall verified to Hagar, his musical guest in the May 2015 season premiere of &quot;Live from Daryl&#x27;s House&quot;, that he was approached after a Hall &amp; Oates concert.

Eddie was introduced to Sammy Hagar in 1985, via their mutual Ferrari mechanic. Hagar was the former frontman for the hard rock group Montrose, and now a solo artist coming off a very successful year. His hit single &quot;I Can&#x27;t Drive 55&quot; came from his 1984 album &quot;VOA&quot;, produced by Ted Templeman, who had also produced Montrose&#x27;s first album &quot;Montrose&quot;, as well as all of Van Halen&#x27;s albums up to that point. Hagar agreed to sing as well as play rhythm guitar.

When Warner Bros. president Mo Ostin came to the band&#x27;s 5150 Studios to hear the band&#x27;s progress, Hagar said the band played &quot;Why Can&#x27;t This Be Love&quot; live with Eddie on keyboards, after which Ostin proclaimed: &quot;I smell money.&quot;

The 1986 Van Halen album &quot;5150&quot; was a huge hit, becoming the band&#x27;s first No. 1 album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, driven by the keyboard-dominated singles &quot;Why Can&#x27;t This Be Love&quot; (#3 U.S.), &quot;Dreams&quot;, and &quot;Love Walks In&quot; (Top 30 U.S.). To further introduce the new era for the band, a new Van Halen logo was put on the cover. The new logo retained elements of the original, but now the lines extending from either side of &#x27;VH&#x27; wrapped around and formed a ring.

Following the release of the &quot;5150&quot; album, the &quot;5150 Tour&quot; was launched to support it across North America. Footage was released on VHS and Laserdisc as &quot;Live Without a Net&quot;. The band minimized the use of pre-Hagar Van Halen songs in the set.

All four studio albums produced during this period reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop music charts and 17 singles breached the top 12 of the mainstream rock tracks chart. During that era, a single taken from 1988&#x27;s &quot;OU812&quot;, &quot;When It&#x27;s Love&quot;, reached the Top Five, peaking at No. 5. In addition, Van Halen was nominated for two Grammy awards. The band won the 1992 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal for the album &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot;. Van Halen continued to enjoy success throughout the mid-1990s. They recorded a live album and concert film at two 1992 F.U.C.K. tour shows in Fresno, California called &quot;.&quot; During the F.U.C.K. and the live album supporting Live: Right Here Right Now tour, Night Ranger&#x27;s Alan Fitzgerald played keyboards offstage every night allowing Eddie to concentrate on guitar. Fitzgerald would return to play-offstage keyboards on the 2004, 2007, and 2012 tours.

In 1995, Van Halen released the album &quot;Balance&quot; and supported Bon Jovi on their European Summer stadium tour. The Balance Tour was nicknamed the &quot;Ambulance Tour&quot; by the band due to an amount of physical ailments, as Hagar had throat problems during the first concerts, Eddie suffered a hip injury caused by avascular necrosis, and Alex wore a neck brace due to ruptured vertebrae.

During the recording of songs for the film &quot;Twister&quot;, escalating tension between Hagar and the Van Halen brothers boiled over and Hagar departed on Father&#x27;s Day, 1996. Hagar would claim he was fired, and Eddie would claim Hagar quit. The band had recorded &quot;Humans Being&quot;, a song for which Eddie, unhappy with Hagar&#x27;s lyrics, retitled the song and wrote the melody. This upset Hagar, and when they were to record a second song for the soundtrack, Hagar was in Hawaii for the birth of his child. It was not an easy birth as the baby was breech, so it needed to be delivered via C-section. With Hagar back in Hawaii and against the idea of doing the project, but having another song left to contribute, the Van Halen brothers alone recorded the instrumental &quot;Respect the Wind&quot;. The performance, which featured Eddie playing guitar and Alex playing keyboards, was nominated for Best Rock Instrumental Performance at the 39th Annual Grammy Awards.

The band was also working on a compilation album. This led to conflicts with Hagar and the group&#x27;s new manager, Ray Danniels (Ed Leffler&#x27;s replacement and Alex Van Halen&#x27;s former brother-in-law), even though it was Leffler who had renewed their contract with Warner Bros. Records and had added in the Best Of album option years before. Hagar was reluctant to work on a compilation album before a new album came out, but if the rest of the band and Danniels insisted on going forward with one at that time, his preference was that it should include only Roth-era songs, or as a third choice, that two volumes should be released, one of Roth-era songs and one of Hagar-era songs. During this same period, competing personal priorities and creative differences contributed to increasing interpersonal tensions within the band, particularly between Eddie and Hagar. The relationship between Hagar and Van Halen broke down.

===1996: Temporary reunion with Roth===
David Lee Roth called Eddie to discuss what tracks would be included on a planned Van Halen compilation (work on which had actually begun before Hagar&#x27;s departure). They got along well, and Eddie invited him up to his house/studio. Shortly afterwards, Roth re-entered the studio with the band and producer Glen Ballard. Two songs from those sessions were added to the band&#x27;s &quot;Best Of – Volume I&quot; album and released as singles to promote it.

In September, Van Halen was asked to present an award at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards. They agreed, and on September 4, 1996, the four original members of Van Halen made their first public appearance together in over eleven years. This helped to bring the compilation to No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. However, unknown to Roth, Eddie and Alex were still auditioning other singers, including Mitch Malloy.

The band&#x27;s appearance on the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards fueled reunion speculation. But several weeks after the awards show, it was discovered that Roth was out of Van Halen again. Roth released a statement that Van Halen misled him into thinking they were seriously considering bringing him back into the band and that he had made clear to them beforehand that he did not want to do the awards show unless they were actually reuniting. The next day, the Van Halen brothers and Anthony released their own statement, denying they had in any way led Roth to believe they were planning to bring him back into the band.

Eddie later recounted that at the MTV Video Music Awards appearance, he was embarrassed and outraged by Roth&#x27;s antics while on camera behind Beck, who was giving an acceptance speech for the award that Van Halen had presented to him. At a backstage press conference, press queries about a reunion tour were met with Eddie saying that he needed a hip replacement and would have to record an entire new studio album before any tour. Roth told Eddie to avoid talking about negative things like his hip and the two almost came to blows.

===1996–2000: Gary Cherone era===

Van Halen&#x27;s next lead singer was Gary Cherone, former frontman of the Boston-based band Extreme, a group which had enjoyed some popular success in the early 1990s. The result was the album &quot;Van Halen III&quot;. Many songs were longer and more experimental than Van Halen&#x27;s earlier work. It was a notable contrast from their previous material, with more focus on ballads than traditional rock songs (&quot;How Many Say I&quot;, with Eddie on vocals). Sales were poor by the band&#x27;s standards, only reaching a Gold certification, despite the album peaking at No. 4 on the U.S. charts. However, &quot;Van Halen III&quot; did produce the hit &quot;Without You&quot;, and another album track, &quot;Fire in the Hole&quot;, appeared on the &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; soundtrack. The album was followed by a tour. The &quot;III&quot; Tour saw Van Halen playing in new countries, including first ever visits to Australia and New Zealand. &quot;Without You&quot; acquired No. 1 place on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Charts in 1998, the 13th song of theirs to do so. This made them the band with the most Mainstream Rock No. 1s.

Van Halen returned to the studio and in early 1999 started work on a new album. For the sessions, they brought on Danny Kortchmar to produce. Working titles of songs included &quot;Left for Dead&quot;, &quot;River Wide&quot;, &quot;Say Uncle&quot;, &quot;You Wear it Well&quot;, &quot;More Than Yesterday&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Miss You ... Much&quot;, &quot;Love Divine&quot;, and &quot;From Here, Where Do We Go?&quot;; more than 20 songs were rumored to have been written. The project was never released, with Cherone leaving the band amicably in November 1999, citing musical differences and personal issues that he was going through. None of the material from these sessions has been released, and in fact the band released no new material until three new songs written and recorded with Hagar were included on the 2004 &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; compilation.

Cherone later stated that he believed if he and the band had toured first and then recorded an album they might have creatively gelled more and the album would have turned out better.

Touring with Cherone had proven disappointing in terms of attendance. Eddie later admitted that Warner Bros. had forced his hand in parting with Cherone. Unlike with the previous two singers, there was reportedly no bad blood behind the breakup, and Cherone remained in contact and on good terms with Van Halen. As when Hagar left, speculation resumed on a Roth reunion.

===1999–2003: Hiatus from public===
Eddie recovered from his hip surgery in November 1999, but from 2000 to early 2004 no official statements were made by Van Halen and no music was released. However, information about members past and present trickled in. The Van Halen brothers continued writing at 5150 Studios, Cherone recorded an album and toured with new band Tribe of Judah. One of the songs that Cherone had written for the scrapped second album with Van Halen, titled &quot;Left For Dead&quot;, would see its lyrics set to a new musical arrangement with Tribe of Judah.
Responding to speculation that he had been approached to replace Cherone, David Coverdale said, &quot;I called a mutual friend and said, &#x27;Tell Eddie I had nothing to do with this.&#x27; It just got ridiculous. I&#x27;ve heard that they were going to approach me, but since I left Purple I&#x27;ve always done my own thing. Why would I join anybody else?&quot;

In 2000, the band reunited briefly with David Lee Roth attempting to do a new album, only for disputes with Roth to abort these plans. The recorded demos would be among the ones reworked into new songs on 2012&#x27;s &quot;A Different Kind of Truth&quot;. The band also tried to just schedule some concerts with Roth at a later date. In 2001, the band had entered early discussions with Ozzy Osbourne to serve as the next lead vocalist of the band. Negotiations ended, due to the production schedule of &quot;The Osbournes&quot; however.

In the summer of 2002, Roth and Hagar teamed up in the &quot;Song for Song, the Heavyweight Champs of Rock and Roll&quot; tour (also known as the &#x27;Sans-Halen&#x27; or &#x27;Sam &amp; Dave&#x27; Tour). The tour, with both singers headlining, attracted media and audience fascination because it seemed more improbable than even a Van Halen tour with Roth or Hagar. It drew large crowds and featured no opening acts, Roth and Hagar alternating as the first act. Roth contrasted his personality with Hagar&#x27;s: &quot;He&#x27;s the kind of guy you go out with to split a bottle with a friend. I&#x27;m the kind of guy you go out with if you want to split your friend with a bottle.&quot; Anthony guested with Hagar&#x27;s band, the Waboritas, numerous times and sometimes even sang lead vocals. During performances, Hagar would tease Anthony by asking, &quot;Do the brothers know you&#x27;re here?&quot; Anthony never played with Roth. Cherone appeared on occasion. Hagar released a live album (&quot;Hallelujah&quot;), featuring vocals by Anthony and Cherone, and a documentary DVD, &quot;Long Road to Cabo&quot;, about touring with Roth. While the two singers promoted the tour and publicly claimed mutual respect, rumors of bitter acrimony and mutual loathing swirled. The allegations were later supported by backstage video, which showed the Roth and Hagar camps maintaining strict separation.

Next, Hagar joined with Joe Satriani and Journey guitarist Neal Schon to form a side project, Planet Us, with Michael Anthony and Deen Castronovo (also of Journey) on drums. The band recorded just two songs and played live a few times before dissolving when Hagar and Anthony rejoined Van Halen.

On July 4, 2004, Roth performed with one of the world&#x27;s most popular orchestras, the Boston Pops, at United States&#x27; annual &quot;Pops Goes the Fourth&quot; celebration in Boston. Hagar remained active, releasing five albums and creating his own merchandising brand &quot;Cabo Wabo&quot;, which lends its name to the line of tequila he formerly owned, as well as his franchise of cantinas. He reunited with Montrose in 2003 and 2005 for a few performances and maintained contact with Anthony, often playing with him. With Van Halen inactive, Anthony set up a website and worked on merchandising projects such as his signature Yamaha bass and range of hot sauces. He became involved with the annual music industry NAMM Show.

===2003–2005: Reunion with Hagar===

Anthony had repeatedly contacted Hagar regarding a reunion, detailing how the attempts to do the same with Roth never worked out. Eventually, Hagar decided to call Alex to spend a day together with him. The two got along and became interested in reuniting on stage. In late March 2004, Van Halen and Hagar announced that Hagar would reunite with the band for a new compilation release and a summer concert tour of the U.S.

In July 2004, Van Halen released &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot;, a double CD compilation featuring three new songs with Hagar: &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;, &quot;Up for Breakfast&quot;, and &quot;Learning to See&quot;. These new songs were credited to Hagar/Van Halen/Van Halen, which was unusual since normally the entire lineup, which also included Michael Anthony, would be credited. However, the performance was credited to the entire band. Anthony later revealed in interviews that Eddie had in fact not wanted him to be a part of the reunion, with him only joining at Hagar&#x27;s insistence. The new songs had already been recorded, with Eddie playing the bass parts himself instead, and Anthony only provided backing vocals for the three tracks. No songs with Cherone from &quot;Van Halen III&quot; were included. It was certified platinum in the US in August 2004.

The Summer 2004 tour grossed almost US$55 million, and Pollstar listed Van Halen in the top 10 grossing tours of 2004. Professional reviews of the tour, however, proved to be mixed. On some shows, Eddie&#x27;s son Wolfgang came onstage and played guitar with his father during &quot;316&quot;, a song dedicated to his son, taking its name from his March 16 date of birth. During the later stages of the tour, stories of Eddie being drunk began to surface along with fan-shot video footage of poor playing. At the band&#x27;s final show of the tour, in Tucson, Eddie smashed one of his guitars at the end of the show.

After the tour, things broke down. At first Hagar stated he had yet to decide what he would be doing with Van Halen, although he was still an official member of the band. Soon after, however, both Hagar and Anthony admitted that Eddie had problems with alcohol during the tour that affected everyone involved. Hagar stated that he was &quot;done with Van Halen&quot; and wished that everyone would have &quot;taken it more seriously.&quot; Despite this, Eddie later described himself as &quot;satisfied&quot; with the tour.

After the tour ended, Hagar returned to his solo band the Waboritas, and Anthony appeared with him on tour occasionally. The band quickly faded from view after Hagar left again.

===2006–2008: Second reunion with Roth and Wolfgang Van Halen era===

Rumors of a Roth reunion re-emerged and on January 3, 2006, Roth explained during an interview that he had spoken to Alex Van Halen the previous week and a reunion was &quot;inevitable.&quot; However, he also said that Eddie Van Halen was &quot;off in his own little world&quot; recently. When asked if any problems occurred with Hagar during the 2004 tour Eddie answered, &quot;Sammy is Sammy, and for the most part that&#x27;s just fine.&quot; Roth persisted with suggestions of a reunion, saying, &quot;People want the reunion,&quot; and &quot;No one will pay respect to what any of us do [musically] until we get the reunion out of the way.&quot; In May 2006, he told Billboard.com, &quot;There&#x27;s contact between the two camps.&quot;

On June 3, Anthony began a successful tour with Hagar billed as the Other Half (a reference to them being half of Van Halen with the other half being Eddie/Alex), with Anthony singing lead vocals sometimes. Meanwhile, on June 19 the Van Halen brothers jumped onstage with Kenny Chesney at The Home Depot Center performing &quot;Jump&quot; and &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;. This unusual performance was their first onstage since the 2004 tour. This was followed by another Eddie performance on July 19, 2006, at the House of Petals in Los Angeles, playing new material. He followed this with an announcement on July 27, 2006, that some of his new music would be released on the soundtrack for the pornographic film &quot;Sacred Sin&quot;.

In March 2006, Anthony spoke to Japanese rock magazine &quot;Burrn!&quot;, claiming the brothers did not want him on the 2004 reunion tour, although Hagar did (and would not play without Anthony), but he had to agree to reduced royalties and end absolutely all association with the band after the tour in terms of rights to using the name to promote himself. In this same interview he admitted he was not involved in the new songs on &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; and only recorded three tracks for &quot;Van Halen III&quot;.

Anthony was replaced as bass player by Eddie&#x27;s son, Wolfgang Van Halen, in 2006. On September 8, 2006, Howard Stern&#x27;s live interview with Eddie broke the band&#x27;s long silence. Eddie said he was willing to reunite with Roth and revealed a solo album in the works. Eddie confirmed that Wolfgang had replaced Anthony on bass; Wolfgang had played guitar alongside his father during Eddie&#x27;s guitar solo on some 2004 concert dates. When queried about the Other Half tour, Eddie said Anthony could &quot;do what he wants&quot; now. This shocked and offended many fans. In November, Eddie&#x27;s spokesperson, Janie Liszewski, claimed the Van Halen family was writing/rehearsing for a summer 2007 tour, which &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s website shortly confirmed. However, the Van Halen website remained in the state it had been in since the Hagar reunion.

On December 11, 2006, Eddie stated to &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine that Roth had been directly invited to rejoin the band. However, on December 28, Roth announced that he had not talked to Eddie in two years, and a reunion with Van Halen could result in a &quot;Jerry Springer-style fight.&quot;

In January 2007, Van Halen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The Van Halen brothers, Anthony, Hagar, and Roth were inducted, though only Hagar and Anthony appeared at the induction ceremony on behalf of the group. Eddie Van Halen was in rehab at the time, so neither he nor Alex attended the ceremony. Velvet Revolver had been slated to perform &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; with Roth on lead vocals. However, Roth wanted to perform &quot;Jump&quot; and the band hadn&#x27;t rehearsed that song, so Roth elected to not attend the ceremony at all, and Velvet Revolver performed &quot;Ain&#x27;t Talkin&#x27; &#x27;Bout Love&quot;. Anthony and Hagar performed &quot;Why Can&#x27;t This Be Love&quot; with Paul Shaffer. &quot;Billboard&quot; announced on January 24, 2007, that Van Halen would reunite with Roth for a U.S. tour. This was confirmed shortly after on the official Van Halen website.

The Van Halen News Desk announced on February 15, 2007, that a Van Halen &quot;Best Of (1978–1984)&quot;, a single-disc compilation of the Roth era, would be released by April 3. Shortly after, information arrived in a flood. Various sources claimed the tour was shut down as was the new &quot;Best Of&quot; CD. On March 8, 2007, Eddie announced on Van Halen&#x27;s website that he was in rehab. Along with the announcement, a change was made to the website. The logo at the top of the page changed to the original Van Halen logo from their 1978 debut album.

On April 21, 2007, Eddie served as an Honorary Race Official for the NASCAR race at Phoenix International Raceway. On May 24, he posted a note to the Van Halen website confirming that he had completed rehab successfully.

After nearly 10 months of speculation and rumors, Van Halen (and Roth separately via his own website) said that the band would be going on a tour of North America. Roth claimed in the press release that, &quot;the idea is that this will continue on and on and on&quot; and also that a world tour and a new album were both in the works.
Press reaction to the reunion was largely warm, but the re-designed website sparked controversy when Anthony was removed from images of old album artwork. The album covers were restored to their original condition a day later without a word. Wolfgang claimed in 2020 that the omission of Anthony on the website was a choice made by the band&#x27;s marketing team and was done without consent of the band. Once the band discovered the condition of the website, they ordered it be reverted to its original state. The Fall 2007 tour was originally 25 dates, but was extended into 2008 with a second leg.

Van Halen started their new tour on September 27, 2007, in Charlotte, North Carolina. Playing to sellout crowds, the tour generated positive reviews. Amid rumors of Eddie being back in rehab, multiple dates of the tour were postponed. The official reason was the need for medical procedures to be run on Eddie.

On March 5, 2008, &quot;World Entertainment Weekly&quot; to CBS News reported that the reason the tour had been interrupted was Eddie&#x27;s needing to reenter rehab. The report also indicated that it had been a &quot;furious backstage bust-up in Florida with his 17-year-old son and bandmate Wolfgang&quot; which had motivated Eddie to seek help once again.

In response to rumors about Eddie being back in rehab Valerie Bertinelli said that &quot;he is not in rehab.&quot; She did not, however, say if he had recently been in rehab, stating only that he was not currently, a statement echoed by Wolfgang during the 2008 Kids Choice Awards. The tour started back up on April 17 at the Reno Events Center in Nevada.

The tour ended on June 2, 2008, at the Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan. During the show Roth stated multiple times that this would not be their final show and that they would &quot;see everyone next time.&quot; At this show the arena sign was altered to read &quot;VAN HALEN ARENA&quot;. According to the Van Halen News Desk, the reunion tour with Roth was the highest grossing in the band&#x27;s history, raking in almost $93 million.

On July 3, 2008, Van Halen headlined the Quebec City Summer Festival in front of a crowd of 85,000.

===2008–2015: &quot;A Different Kind of Truth&quot;===
In an interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot;, posted on November 12, 2008, about the making of his upcoming new EVH Wolfgang guitar from Fender, Eddie said, in regard to new Van Halen music, &quot;I&#x27;ll be making music &#x27;til the day I die. I&#x27;ve done all kinds of stuff, and more is coming. I can&#x27;t tell you exactly when right now. Wolfgang is in the 12th grade and he needs to graduate first. Then I&#x27;m getting married in June. We&#x27;ll pick it up after that.&quot; Eddie underwent surgery on his left hand in 2009, following some treatment for arthritis as he felt pain in his fingers during the 2007 tour. In an interview with &quot;Glide Magazine&quot; appearing in the May 2010 issue, Dweezil Zappa commented that Eddie had played him &quot;new stuff from his record.&quot; It was not clear from the interview if the music was intended for a new Van Halen record.

In August 2010, Warner/Chappell Music extended its administration agreements with Van Halen (specifically Eddie and Alex Van Halen). Under the agreement, Warner/Chappell will continue to administer their catalog of works. This press release also stated that the group was in the studio recording an album with Roth, that was due for release in 2011.

Van Halen entered the Henson Studio C with producer John Shanks on January 17, 2011. Shanks posted on his Twitter account that he was in the studio with the band and posted a picture of one of Eddie&#x27;s signature amps.

On June 16, 2011, Creed, Alter Bridge and Tremonti guitarist Mark Tremonti claimed that he had been invited to 5150 studios and that Eddie, Alex and Wolfgang Van Halen performed the album live, in its entirety, for Tremonti and Creed touring guitarist, Eric Friedman. Producer/engineer Ross Hogarth claimed on July 31, 2011, that &quot;[t]he whole Van Halen record has been recorded.&quot; On September 5, 2011, it was reported that the mixing on the new album had been completed in mid-August, and production had progressed to the mastering stage.

Their official website was updated on December 26, 2011, announcing that tickets for their 2012 tour would be available starting January 10, 2012. On January 5, 2012, Van Halen played an intimate club gig at New York City&#x27;s Cafe Wha? which received widespread praise from media and fans. On January 10, the upcoming album&#x27;s first single, titled &quot;Tattoo&quot;, made its premiere on radio stations. The following week, the single debuted at No. 67 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Chart. The band&#x27;s new studio album from Interscope Records, titled &quot;A Different Kind of Truth&quot;, was released on February 7, 2012. It was Van Halen&#x27;s first studio release since 1998&#x27;s &quot;Van Halen III&quot; and the first new music from the band since the three new songs from the 2004&#x27;s &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; compilation. It would also be the first Van Halen album to feature Eddie&#x27;s son, Wolfgang, on the bass in place of Anthony. This would also be the first full-length album to feature Roth on vocals in over 27 years, and the first new material with him in 15 years, since the two new songs with him on the &quot;Best Of – Volume I&quot;.
On February 8, 2012, Van Halen performed a &quot;friends and family&quot; dress rehearsal at the Forum in Inglewood, California. The show featured many classics as well as several new songs from &quot;A Different Kind of Truth&quot;. Despite Van Halen&#x27;s long lay-off between studio albums, &quot;A Different Kind of Truth&quot; sold 188,000 copies during its first six days of release, debuting at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Albums Chart. There was an overwhelmingly positive critical and fan response to &quot;A Different Kind of Truth&quot;, which helped to fuel the album&#x27;s long run in the upper reaches of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Album Chart; additionally, it earned the band its highest-ever charting album in the United Kingdom (debuting at No. 6).

Despite an average ticket price of approximately $150, Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;A Different Kind of Truth Tour&quot; proved to be a commercial success as well, with nearly all U.S. arena shows &quot;either sold-out, or close to it.&quot; Critically, the band received mostly positive reviews, particularly when performing throughout the U.S. Northeast and West Coast. R&amp;B legends Kool and the Gang were hand-picked by frontman Roth to open the first two legs of Van Halen&#x27;s tour.

On May 17, 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported that Van Halen was postponing all tour dates after their show of June 26 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Shortly thereafter, the Van Halen News Desk revealed that the band&#x27;s members were in good health, had not been arguing with each other, and that the reason for the postponed tour dates was to take a break after 18 months of non-stop recording and touring as well as to allow the group the opportunity to enhance its concert presentation before resuming the tour in the late summer of 2012. However, the postponed dates were officially listed as canceled shortly thereafter.

On August 30, 2012, Eddie was diagnosed with diverticulitis and underwent surgery postponing the shows in Japan initially scheduled for November 2012. On April 20, 2013, the Roth-fronted Van Halen played its first show outside North America since 1984, and their first in Australia since 1998, at the Stone Festival in Sydney. This was followed by one show each in Tokyo and Nagoya, and two in Osaka, from June 18 to 26.

In February 2015, Van Halen fansite VHND.com announced that Van Halen would be releasing their first live album with Roth, &quot;Tokyo Dome Live in Concert&quot;, on March 31, 2015. The album featured performances from their June 23, 2013, performance at the Tokyo Dome. It was also reported that the band would be releasing newly remastered versions of their 1978 debut and &quot;1984&quot; on CD, digital, and vinyl. In an interview the same month, when asked about the status of Van Halen, Eddie responded by saying &quot;I&#x27;d love to make a studio record. Depends on everybody&#x27;s timing. I don&#x27;t know what Dave Lee Roth is up to now. I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s living in New York or Japan or wherever he is.&quot;

===2015–2020: North American Tour, Eddie&#x27;s death, and disbandment===
On March 24, 2015, Van Halen announced a 39 date tour with Roth to take place from July to October 2015 across North America. In April 2015, Eddie told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that the band would &quot;probably hunker down and do a studio record&quot; after their tour. The band worked with Chris Cornell to write songs, and to potentially lead the band; this ended when the singer passed away however.

On September 12, 2019, Van Halen announced that they would be releasing a box set of the Japanese singles, which was released on November 1, 2019. On September 30, 2019, while promoting an upcoming 2020 solo concert, Roth expressed uncertainty towards the band&#x27;s future, stating &quot;I think Van Halen is finished.&quot; However, Hagar indicated in a May 2020 interview that he believed otherwise claiming &quot;Until Ed or Alex Van Halen die, they&#x27;re not finished.&quot; He expressed a hope that the band could reunite with himself and Anthony saying &quot;My dream tour is the Sam and Dave tour with Ed, Al and Mike.&quot;

On October 6, 2020, Wolfgang announced on his Twitter account that Eddie had died from cancer. His death came just ten days after original Van Halen bassist Mark Stone died of cancer. In a November 2020 interview with Howard Stern, Wolfgang Van Halen confirmed the band&#x27;s end, stating &quot;You can&#x27;t have Van Halen without Eddie Van Halen.&quot; He had also confirmed that the band had considered a &quot;kitchen-sink&quot; reunion tour with Hagar, Anthony and Cherone in the mix prior to Eddie&#x27;s illness. He also stated that Eddie had been excited about reuniting with Anthony, Hagar, and Cherone. In August 2023, Wolfgang affirmed that there were no plans for a Van Halen reunion and stated that the band &quot;doesn&#x27;t exist anymore&quot;.

===2024–present: aftermath===
In October and November 2024, Alex Van Halen announced that he has been going through the band&#x27;s various backlog of unreleased songs and his intentions to release the material as a tribute to his deceased brother. He stated: &quot;There are so many different variables in a band like ours. We don&#x27;t just walk in the studio and plan, &#x27;Let&#x27;s make a record,&#x27; although we have done that to some degree. But it&#x27;s not a mechanical process for us. We go in and we play and see what happens, listen to it, invite a couple of people and then see what happens with that. ...But now that Ed&#x27;s gone, none of those things are really valid because all I have, and Wolf has, is all the recordings in the vault. And they will stay there until we figure out how and why and what to do with them. And again, you have to remember, it has to be on the level of where Ed and I, where we used to play.&quot; The musician explained that there is enough material for three to four complete albums. 

Alex detailed that in addition to the need for collaboration with other musicians to complete these variety of songs, he has looked into the potential use of AI to duplicate the style of guitar work by his brother, Eddie Van Halen. Additionally, he expressed interest in hiring Robert Plant as the vocalist for the future albums. He additionally announced plans to develop a biopic about the band&#x27;s formation.

==Contract riders==

The complex technical demands of a Van Halen tour ultimately had a notable side-effect on modern pop music tours, especially via the concert&#x27;s technical contract rider. The band used contract riders to verify the venue&#x27;s power availability, security, structural and weight distribution details. Their now-famous riders specified that a bowl of M&amp;M&#x27;s candies was to be placed in their dressing room and, separately, in a different area of the contract, that all of the brown M&amp;M&#x27;s were to be removed. According to both manager Noel Monk and Roth, this was listed in the technical portion of the contract not because the band wanted to make capricious demands of the venue location, but rather as a test to see if the electrical, structural, security, and safety requirements in the rider had been thoroughly observed.

If the bowl, without brown M&amp;Ms was present, then the band, management and crew could safely assume the other, more legitimate concerns in the technical rider were fulfilled; conversely, if the bowl was missing, or brown M&amp;M&#x27;s were present, then Van Halen management would be within their rights to have their crew or the venue inspect the work, redo it or even cancel the night&#x27;s production at the venue&#x27;s expense. In one notable incident, officials at what is now Colorado State University Pueblo refused to honor the request, leading the band to go on a rampage that involved throwing food all over a dining area as well as &quot;unmentionable&quot; acts in a nearby restroom. However, even more damage was caused to the basketball floor in the gymnasium due to the weight of the stage brought in.

==Musical style==
Van Halen&#x27;s musical style has been described as hard rock, heavy metal, AOR, pop rock, and glam metal. The band&#x27;s early material has been described as a &quot;party-ready pop metal sound&quot; spearheaded by David Lee Roth&#x27;s &quot;over-the-top&quot; vocal style, while their later material has been described as &quot;milder&quot; and &quot;more accessible&quot;.

<text>Tarrytown is a village in the town of Greenburgh in Westchester County, New York, United States. It is located on the eastern bank of the Hudson River, approximately north of Midtown Manhattan in New York City, and is served by a stop on the Metro-North Hudson Line. To the north of Tarrytown is the village of Sleepy Hollow (formerly &quot;North Tarrytown&quot;), to the south the village of Irvington and to the east unincorporated parts of Greenburgh. The Tappan Zee Bridge crosses the Hudson at Tarrytown, carrying the New York State Thruway (Interstates 87 and 287) to South Nyack, Rockland County and points in Upstate New York. The population was 11,860 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The Native American Weckquaesgeek tribe, who were closely related to the Wappinger Confederacy and further related to the Mohicans, lived in the area prior to European settlement. They fished the Hudson River for shad, oysters and other shellfish. Their principal settlement was at what is now the foot of Church Street near the Hudson River shore, between the current location of Losee Park and the Tappan Zee Bridge, at a place they called &quot;Alipconk&quot;, or the &quot;Place of Elms&quot;.

The first European settlers of Tarrytown were Dutch farmers, fur trappers, and fishermen. Records show that the first Dutch residence in Tarrytown was built in 1645; however, the exact location of this residence is not known. Tarrytown sits within the lands of the former Dutch Colony of New Netherland which fell under English rule in 1674 with the signing of the Treaty of Westminster. The name may come from the Dutch &quot;tarwe&quot;, meaning &quot;wheat&quot;.

In 1780, in a famous American Revolutionary War incident, British Major John André was arrested in Tarrytown, which exposed the plans of American defector Benedict Arnold. André was traveling south through the village on the Albany Post Road when he was stopped and searched by three local militiamen David Williams, John Paulding, and Isaac Van Wart. When suspicious papers were found in his boot, he was arrested as a spy, and later convicted and hanged. A circumstantial account of André&#x27;s capture by militiamen was written in 1903 by the owner and publisher of the &quot;Tarrytown Argus&quot;, Marcius D. Raymond.

The writer Washington Irving described Tarrytown in &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; (1820). Irving began his story, &quot;In the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern shore of the Hudson, at that broad expansion of the river denominated by the ancient Dutch navigators of the Tappan Zee, and where they always prudently shortened sail and implored the protection of St. Nicholas when they crossed, there lies a small market town or rural port which by some is called Greenburgh, but which is more generally and properly known by the name of Tarry Town. This name was given, we are told, in former days, by the good housewives of the adjacent country, from the inveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village tavern on market days.&quot; The Underground Railroad ran through Tarrytown prior to the end of the U.S. Civil War.

Tarrytown later became a favorite residence for many rich New Yorkers, including John D. Rockefeller, who first moved to Tarrytown in 1893. Kykuit, Rockefeller&#x27;s elaborate mansion, was completed in 1906. In 1914, Kykuit became the site of numerous labor protests by radical anarchists, which protests were broken up by police in a series of violent clashes. Kykuit was the intended target of at least two bombing attacks planned by anarchists associated with the radical journalists Alexander Berkman and Luigi Galleani.

On November 19, 1915, a powerful dynamite bomb was discovered at Cedar Cliff, the Tarrytown estate of John D. Archbold, President of the Standard Oil Company. Police theorized the bomb was planted by anarchists and Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) radicals as a protest against the execution of IWW member Joe Hill in Salt Lake City. The bomb was discovered by a gardener, John Walquist, who found four sticks of dynamite, weighing a pound each, half hidden in a rut in a driveway 50 feet from the front entrance of the residence. The dynamite sticks were bound together by a length of wire, fitted with percussion caps, and wrapped with a piece of paper matching the color of the driveway, a path used by Archbold when going to or from his home by automobile. The bomb was later defused by police.

The Christ Episcopal Church, First Baptist Church of Tarrytown, Foster Memorial AME Zion Church, Washington Irving High School, North Grove Street Historic District, Patriot&#x27;s Park, and Tarrytown Music Hall are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Lyndhurst and Sunnyside are listed as National Historic Landmarks.

The General Motors car manufacturing plant North Tarrytown Assembly was located in North Tarrytown until 1996. Today&#x27;s Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line runs through the abandoned property.

Sleepy Hollow Mayor Philip Zegarelli, in March 2007, met with Tarrytown Mayor Drew Fixell and district superintendent Howard Smith to discuss forming a blue-ribbon panel that would explore the pros and cons of an intermunicipal agreement. The two villages have shared a school district for 55 years. The villages already shared some services, as well, to lower their expenses, but the greatest reductions, especially in school and property taxes, would come from merging the two villages. However, each village has its own assessment roll. Zegarelli, who led an unsuccessful attempt in the mid-1970s to disaffiliate Sleepy Hollow from the town of Mount Pleasant, continues to advocate for secession – Sleepy Hollow from Mount Pleasant and Tarrytown from Greenburgh – as another way to save money. &quot;If the idea is to save money, why have two levels of government?&quot; he asked. The town of Mount Pleasant blocked Sleepy Hollow&#x27;s effort to secede, largely because it did not want to lose tax revenue from General Motors, Zegarelli said.

In 2014, Tarrytown was ranked second in the list of the top 10 places to live in New York, according to the national online real estate brokerage Movoto.

==Education==
Tarrytown was home to Marymount College, an independent women&#x27;s college established in 1907. Amid financial struggle, Marymount was taken over by Fordham University in 2002, but the effort was unsuccessful: the last graduates of &quot;Marymount College of Fordham University&quot; received diplomas in 2007. The historic hilltop campus was sold to the Swiss firm EF and became a branch of its foreign exchange secondary school, the EF International Academy.
Tarrytown is divided between two school districts: Union Free School District of the Tarrytowns and Irvington Union Free School District. The former school district also includes most of Sleepy Hollow. The Tarrytown school district supervises four separate K-8 schools, as well as Sleepy Hollow High School. A Roman Catholic elementary, the Transfiguration School (of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York), was established in 1949 and is maintained by the local parish.

Tarrytown is also home to the Hackley School, a private K–12 college preparatory. Situated on Castle Ridge, the school first opened in 1899.

The Westchester Library System has its headquarters just outside Tarrytown in an unincorporated area of Greenburgh.

==Culture==
In 2018 Brooke Lea Foster of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that it was one of several &quot;Rivertowns&quot; in New York State, which she described as among the &quot;least suburban of suburbs, each one celebrated by buyers there for its culture and hip factor, as much as the housing stock and sophisticated post-city life.&quot; Of those, Foster stated that Irvington was &quot;the most charming&quot;.

===Religion===
Tarrytown&#x27;s churches (many of which are located on Broadway, the village&#x27;s largest thoroughfare) cover all major denominations. Tarrytown is served by Episcopalian, Baptist, Catholic, Christian Science, Methodist, Reformed, and Korean churches. The Foster Memorial AME Zion Church on Wildey Street is the oldest black church in Westchester County. Tarrytown&#x27;s single largest religious denomination is Roman Catholicism, with over 60% of residents of Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow identifying as Catholics. Three Roman Catholic churches (Church of the Transfiguration, Immaculate Conception Church, and St. Theresa&#x27;s) serve the community&#x27;s Catholics and provide numerous social services including the Transfiguration School. Tarrytown is also the home of the motherhouse of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary, a Catholic woman&#x27;s religious order that founded and staffed the now-defunct Marymount College (now EF School).

Tarrytown also has a large Jewish community, which encompasses all major denominations. Temple Beth Abraham, located on Leroy Avenue, services both the Reform and Conservative communities. The DoubleTree Inn features a Glatt Kosher kitchen, as well as an Orthodox prayer service (minyan) on the Jewish sabbath (Shabbat). The local Jewish Community Center, JCC on the Hudson, features family programs, camps, and educational opportunities from a non-denominational approach.

<text>Thornwood is a hamlet (unincorporated community), census-designated place (CDP), and postal designation (with zip code 10594) in the town of Mount Pleasant in Westchester County, New York, United States. The population was 3,759 at the 2010 census.

==History==

In 1891, Lewis Smadback started a very successful development at what is now Thornwood. The village of Sherman Park was incorporated in 1906 and the name was changed to Hillside in 1909. The village was dissolved in 1914, when Thornwood took its current name and became a hamlet within the Town of Mount Pleasant. It is possible that Thornwood is a derivative of &quot;Hawthorne&#x27;s Woods,&quot; since Hawthorne is an adjacent hamlet. Another possibility is Thornwood is named after an area in Glasgow, Scotland.

Thornwood once had a large and thriving Westchester marble quarry near its heart, the intersection of Route 141 and Kensico Road (known as Four Corners). Dating back to 1845, the quarry supplied white marble which helped build St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral (hence the name of Marble Avenue which runs through the hamlet). The quarry pit was filled in during the mid-1980s, and the Town Center shopping mall was constructed over it.

Thornwood once had a station on the Harlem Line of the Metro-North Railroad and was approximately a 48-minute ride to Grand Central Terminal. The station building remains on Commerce Street, but the stop was eliminated when the up-starter Harlem Line (north of North White Plains) was electrified in the mid-1980s. Thornwood was the only stop eliminated as a result of the electrification process. While the station could accommodate diesel trains, the curvature of the tracks as proceeding north to Pleasantville made the construction at Thornwood of an elevated platform, necessary for electric trains, impractical.

The death of baby Kristie Fischer took place in 1991.

The seminarians studying here for the Catholic priesthood usually major in philosophy at the Thornwood Conference Center. However, due to a lack of vocations and private funds—partly due to the abuse scandal caused by the order&#x27;s founder, Father Marcial Maciel Degollado, which resulted in a Vatican investigation and revision—the entire course of Seminary studies will now be taken at the Legionaries&#x27; Seminary in Rome, Italy and the building will be sold.

<text>Tuckahoe is a village in Westchester County, New York, United States. One-and-a-half miles long and three-quarters of a mile wide, with the Bronx River serving as its western boundary, the Village of Tuckahoe is approximately sixteen miles north of midtown Manhattan in Southern Westchester County. As of the 2010 census, the village&#x27;s population was 6,486.

The village can be reached by the Metro-North railroad system. The Tuckahoe and Crestwood stations are 32 minutes and 34 minutes from New York City&#x27;s Grand Central Terminal, respectively.

==History==

===Industry and growth===


The name &quot;Tuckahoe,&quot; meaning “it is globular,&quot; was a general term used by the Native Americans of the region when describing various bulbous roots which were used as food. Throughout the 1700s and 1800s, Tuckahoe was a rural, minor community which was part of the larger town of Eastchester. It was not until the early nineteenth century that Tuckahoe first became a semi-prominent part of the New York Metropolitan Area upon the discovery of vast, high-quality, white marble deposits near the Bronx River by Scottish businessman Alexander Masterson. Through the use of his financial wealth and influence, Masterson started Tuckahoe&#x27;s marble industry, its first quarry in 1812. The high quality of &quot;Tuckahoe Marble&quot; was in great demand, quickly transforming the once quiet village into the &quot;marble capital of the world&quot;. In the 1840s, to serve quarry owners who transported marble to the city, the New York and Harlem Railroad opened two train depots in Tuckahoe. The booming industry drew succeeding waves of German, Irish and Italian immigrant workers, and, after the Civil War, African-Americans who migrated from the South. The Tuckahoe quarries produced heavily for almost a century before supplies dwindled and the industry ended. The village&#x27;s Church of the Immaculate Conception was constructed for the predominantly Catholic population using Tuckahoe Marble.

During the 1920s Burroughs Wellcome (now part of GlaxoSmithKline) established research and manufacturing facilities on Scarsdale Road on land acquired from the Hodgman Rubber Company, and for many years was a leading industry in Tuckahoe until the company moved to Research Triangle Park in North Carolina in 1971. The Nobel Prize winning scientists Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings worked there and invented drugs still used many years later, such as the cancer and autoimmune disease suppressant mercaptopurine.

<text>Valhalla ( ) is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) within the town of Mount Pleasant, in Westchester County, New York, United States, in the New York City metropolitan area. Its population was 3,162 at the 2010 U.S. Census. The name was inspired by a fan of the composer Richard Wagner, and the hamlet is known both as the home of the primary hospital campus of Westchester Medical Center and New York Medical College and as the burial place of numerous noted people. &quot;Valhalla&quot; is named after the hall of the slain in Norse mythology.

== History ==

=== Kensico Cemetery ===
The Kensico Cemetery was founded in 1889 in Valhalla at a time when many of the cemeteries in the city of New York were filling up, and several rural cemeteries were founded near the railroads that served the metropolis. Initially in size, the cemetery was expanded to in 1905, but reduced to in 1912, when a portion of its land was sold to the neighboring Gate of Heaven Cemetery. 

The Kensico Cemetery is the final resting place of numerous famous people, including legendary New York Yankees star Lou Gehrig; virtuoso pianist, composer, and conductor Sergei Rachmaninoff; the author Ayn Rand; and NBC founder David Sarnoff. It was also, after the Suicide of Danny Chen, the final resting place of Pvt. Danny Chen.

Valhalla and neighboring Hawthorne are fairly densely packed with cemeteries, albeit not as densely as Colma, California.

=== Recent events ===
On July 12, 2006, the Westchester tornado, an F2 event, touched down in nearby Hawthorne and proceeded to move into Valhalla, causing much destruction in the Stonegate section of the community. This was one of the strongest tornadoes the area had ever seen, as tornadoes of this magnitude are mostly in the Midwest. Power lines were knocked down, and hundreds of trees were uprooted. There were no deaths, but much of Valhalla changed as a result.

On September 11, 2006, &quot;The Rising&quot; memorial to September 11 victims was dedicated at the Kensico Dam by Westchester County and the Westchester County September 11 Memorial Committee. &quot;The Rising&quot; honors the 109 county residents who were killed in the terrorist attacks.

In July 2007, Valhalla hosted the opening ceremony of the 2007 Empire State Games. The ceremony was held at the Kensico Dam honoring the athletes and their families and was attended by Governor Eliot Spitzer among other politicians. ESPN&#x27;s Jeremy Schaap was a keynote speaker.

On February 3, 2015, in the Valhalla train crash, a Metro-North train crashed into a Mercedes-Benz SUV that was stuck on the tracks at Commerce Street near the Taconic State Parkway. The crash caused six deaths and 15 injuries, including seven seriously injured.

<doc id="127595" wikidata="Q7922547" url="?curid=127595" title="Verplanck, New York">
<text>Verplanck is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Cortlandt, Westchester County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 1,729. Both the hamlet and Verplanck&#x27;s Point derive their name from the activities of the Verplanck family, established in New Amsterdam by Abraham Isaacsen Verplanck in the 1630s.

==History==
Verplanck lies on a small peninsula in the extreme northwest of the town of Cortlandt. Tucked along the east bank of the Hudson River, it is bordered by Cortlandt&#x27;s village of Buchanan and hamlet of Montrose.

===Verplanck&#x27;s Point===

Verplanck&#x27;s Point lies at Verplanck&#x27;s southernmost end. The Continental Army of General George Washington encamped at Verplanck&#x27;s Point during the Revolutionary War, as a staging area for crossing the Hudson at adjacent Kings Ferry, lying between the Point and Montrose. Pursued by the army of British General William Howe, it crossed to Stony Point on the west bank, en route to Fort Lee, New Jersey. From there it continued south to Yorktown, Virginia, where Washington received the surrender of General Charles Cornwallis on October 19, 1781.

A year later, in September 1782, Verplanck&#x27;s Point, an alluvial plain and natural place for an encampment during the inherent bottleneck of an arduous and slow ferrying of men and materiel across the river, again became the site of the Continental Army&#x27;s bivouac upon crossing the Hudson.

John Trumbull painted a full-length oil portrait of &quot;Washington at Verplanck&#x27;s Point&quot;, and gifted it to Martha Washington. Based on its success he produced a much larger work scaled up to nearly four times its size for the City of New York, &quot;George Washington&quot;, substituting Evacuation Day of New York City in 1783 as its backdrop for departing French commander-in-chief General Rochambeau&#x27;s review of Washington&#x27;s Continental Army troops on September 14, 1782.

<text>White Plains is a city in and the county seat of Westchester County, New York, United States. It is an inner suburb of New York City, and a commercial hub of Westchester County, a densely populated suburban county that is home to about one million people. White Plains is located in south-central Westchester County. Its downtown (Mamaroneck Avenue) is north of Midtown Manhattan.

The city&#x27;s total population was 59,599 in the 2020 census, up from 53,077 at the 2010 census. According to the city government, the daytime weekday population is estimated at 250,000.

==History==
===Early history===
At the time of the Dutch settlement of Manhattan in the early 17th century, the region had been used as farmland by the Weckquaeskeck tribe, a Wappinger people, and was called &quot;Quarropas&quot;. To early traders it was known as &quot;the White Plains&quot;, either from the white balsam (&quot;Gnaphalium polycephalum&quot;) which was said to have covered it, or from the heavy mist that local tradition suggests hovered over the swamplands near the Bronx River. The first non-native settlement came in November 1683, when a party of Connecticut Puritans moved westward from an earlier settlement in Rye and bought about , presumably from the Weckquaeskeck. However, John Richbell of Mamaroneck claimed to have earlier title to much of the territory through his purchase of a far larger plot extending inland, perhaps from a different tribe. The matter was not settled until 1721, when a Royal Patent for White Plains was granted by King George II.

In 1758, White Plains became the seat of Westchester County when the colonial government for the county left West Chester, which was located in what is now the northern part of the borough of the Bronx, in New York City. The unincorporated village remained part of the Town of Rye until 1788 when the town of White Plains was created.

On July 9, 1776, a copy of the Declaration of Independence was delivered to the New York Provincial Congress, which was meeting in the county courthouse. The delegates quickly adopted a resolution approving the Declaration, thus declaring both the colony&#x27;s independence and the formation of the State of New York. The Declaration itself was first publicly read from the steps of the courthouse on July 11.

During September and October 1776, troops led by George Washington took up positions in the hills of the village, hotly pursued by the British under General Sir William Howe, who attacked on October 28. The Battle of White Plains took place primarily on Chatterton Hill, (later known as &quot;Battle Hill,&quot; and located just west of what was then a swamp but is now the downtown area) and the Bronx River. Howe&#x27;s force of 4,000–6,000 British and Hessian soldiers required three attacks before the Continentals, numbering about 1,600 under the command of Generals Alexander McDougall and Israel Putnam, retreated, joining Washington&#x27;s main force, which did not take part in the battle. Howe&#x27;s forces had suffered 250 casualties, a severe loss, and he made no attempt to pursue the Continentals, whose casualties were about 125 dead and wounded. Three days after the battle, Washington withdrew north of the village, which was then occupied by Howe&#x27;s forces. But after several inconclusive skirmishes over the next week, Howe withdrew on November 5, leaving White Plains to the Continentals. Ironically, one of Washington&#x27;s subordinates, Major John Austin, who was probably drunk after having celebrated the enemy&#x27;s withdrawal, reentered the village with his detachment and proceeded to burn it down. Although he was court-martialed and convicted for this action, he escaped punishment.

The first United States Census, conducted in 1790, listed the White Plains population at 505, of whom 46 were slaves. (New York City&#x27;s population at that time was about 33,000.) By 1800, the population stood at 575 and in 1830, 830. By 1870, 26 years after the arrival of the New York Central Railroad, it had swollen to 2,630 and by 1890 to 4,508. In the decades that followed the count grew to 7,899 (1900) and 26,425 (1910). White Plains was incorporated as a village in 1866 and as a city in 1916.

===Modern history===
After World War II, White Plains&#x27; downtown area developed into a shopping district featuring branches of many famous New York-based department and specialty stores. Some of these retail locations were the first large-scale suburban stores built in the United States. In 1949, Macy&#x27;s launched a grand White Plains store on Main Street across from City Hall. Other prestigious stores followed, such as B. Altman and Co., Rogers Peet, Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord &amp; Taylor, Alexander&#x27;s, Wallachs, and a short-lived branch of Bergdorf Goodman, which was converted to sister chain Neiman Marcus in 1981. Construction of nearby parkways and expressways in the 1940s through the 1970s brought shoppers from elsewhere.

During the late 1960s, the city of White Plains developed an extensive urban renewal plan for residential, commercial and mixed-use redevelopment that called for the demolition of its entire central business district from the Bronx River Parkway east to Mamaroneck Avenue. By 1978, the urban renewal program centered around the construction of the Westchester County Courthouse (1974), the Westchester One office building (1975), the Galleria at White Plains mall (1978), and a number of other office towers, retail centers and smaller commercial buildings. At the time of its construction, the Westchester One building was the largest office building between New York City and Albany, and east to Hartford.

Beginning in the 1950s, many major corporations based in New York City moved operations to White Plains and other suburban locations. These included General Foods, PepsiCo, Hitachi USA, IBM, Nestlé, Snapple, and Heineken USA. In the 1980s, at least 50 Fortune 500 corporations had their headquarters in Westchester County and nearby Fairfield County, Connecticut, but with the corporate mergers and downsizing of the 1990s, many of these companies reduced their operations in White Plains or left the area completely.

White Plains is home to the Arts Exchange Building, which serves as the headquarters of the Westchester Arts Council. Since March 1999, visual and performing artists, emerging cultural organizations and new creative businesses have had studios and offices in the building. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The construction of the Galleria at White Plains mall in the 1970s ushered in a new era of downtown retail and office development, but by the early 1990s, economic development had stagnated, hampered by a deep recession and the overbuilding of the commercial real estate markets. For a time, White Plains had one of the highest office vacancy rates in the northeastern United States. Consolidation within the retail industry led to the closing of many of downtown&#x27;s department and specialty stores. After its bankruptcy, the B. Altman store closed in 1989 and was demolished to make way for The Westchester, an upscale mall that opened in 1995 with anchors Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus. A freestanding branch of Macy&#x27;s, one of downtown&#x27;s original retail anchor stores, was moved two blocks away to The Galleria mall by its parent company, Federated Department Stores, replacing sister retailer Abraham &amp; Straus when these two store divisions were merged in 1995
A new courthouse for the Southern District of New York was opened in 1998 and several large-scale office properties in and near downtown, including the former General Foods headquarters building, were retrofitted and leased to accommodate smaller businesses. The Macy&#x27;s store on Main Street remained vacant for several years until it was also later demolished to make way for the massive City Center at White Plains complex. This large mixed-use development features two 35-story apartment and condominium towers, of retail, restaurant and entertainment space and new parking facilities.

Beginning in 2000, the city&#x27;s permanent population experienced a growth spurt as additional apartment buildings were constructed. The city is 31 minutes by express train from Midtown Manhattan, and this has attracted new residents who commute to New York City for work. In early 2003, the Saks Fifth Avenue location was closed and demolished; it was replaced in 2004 with the large retail complex called The Source at White Plains. In 2007, construction was completed on Renaissance Square, a downtown parcel that includes the luxury Ritz-Carlton hotel.

==Historic sites==
* Jacob Purdy House (1721), used as General George Washington&#x27;s headquarters in 1778 and possibly in 1776 during the Battle of White Plains in the American Revolutionary War. In the 1960s it was repaired and restored, and in 1973 the structure was moved to its present location. A further renovation was conducted around 1980, involving both professional craftsmen and local teenagers in an apprentice program.
* Elijah Miller House (1738), is a historic home in North White Plains, town of North Castle, Westchester County, New York. The house is an 18th-century Rhode Island-style farmhouse that was occupied by General George Washington on three occasions, most notably as a headquarters command post during the Battle of White Plains. In 2010 the county legislature passed a $1.2 million bond issue to finance its restoration. County executive Robert Astorino, who had supported preserving the building five years earlier as a member of the legislature, vetoed the measure, saying it should be supported by private funds.
* White Plains Armory (1910), erected on the site of the first Westchester County Courthouse. A monument in front of the building commemorates the first public reading in New York of the Declaration of Independence, on July 11, 1776.
* White Plains Rural Cemetery, incorporated 1854, although in use as a cemetery from 1797. The cemetery office occupies the structure that was the first Methodist Church in White Plains (1795, rebuilt in 1797 after a fire on the day of its original dedication).
* Percy Grainger Home and Studio, occupied by the composer from 1921 until his death in 1961, and by his widow, Ella Ström-Brandelius, until her death in 1979. It is now maintained as a museum by the International Percy Grainger Society.
* In addition to the above, the Bar Building, Good Counsel Complex, Leo Friedlander Studio, Mapleton, Peoples National Bank and Trust Company Building, Presbyterian Rest for Convalescents, Soundview Manor, and Woman&#x27;s Club of White Plains are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Yorktown is a town on the northern border of Westchester County, New York, United States. A suburb of the New York City metropolitan area, it is approximately north of midtown Manhattan. The population was 36,569 at the 2020 U.S. Census.

== History ==
Yorktown has a rich historical heritage. It was originally inhabited by one or more bands of Wappinger people, including the Kitchawank. Most of Yorktown was part of the Manor of Cortlandt, a Royal Manor granted by King William III for the Van Cortlandt family.

The Croton River, which runs through the southern part of Yorktown, was dammed by the New York City water supply system to provide the city with its first major source of clean and reliable water. The first Croton Dam was located in Yorktown and broke in 1842, causing significant damage to property and major loss of life.
During the American Revolution, Yorktown saw limited action. Late in the war, the Pines Bridge crossing of the Croton River was guarded by the 1st Rhode Island Regiment made up of White, African American, and Native American soldiers. Several of the soldiers were killed, including the regiment&#x27;s commander, Colonel Christopher Greene, on May 14, 1781, at the Battle of Pine&#x27;s Bridge in Croton Heights. A memorial was erected at the Presbyterian Church in Crompond, New York. Major John André, a British officer who communicated with Benedict Arnold, ate his final breakfast at the Underhill House at 370 Underhill Avenue on Hanover Street just before his capture and eventual hanging as a spy.

In 1788, the township was officially incorporated as Yorktown, commemorating the Revolutionary War victory of the Franco-American siege of Yorktown, near Yorktown, Virginia, on October 19, 1781. The area had previously been known as Hanover, with a now unwanted association with King George III.

Moving north after the battle of Yorktown, the French army camped at the site of today&#x27;s French Hill Elementary School, where cannonballs and other relics have been found. Although rumors claim that George Washington passed through Yorktown, no factual records confirm this.

A Bicentennial Committee in 1988 reviewed the town&#x27;s remaining historic sites and determined which should be preserved.

==Rail stops==
Yorktown once had five stations along the New York and Putnam Railroad — Kitchawan, Croton Lake, Croton Heights, Yorktown Heights, and Amawalk. The railroad was purchased by the New York Central Railroad, and ran into the early 1960s, when changes in vacation patterns impacting the numerous resort hotels further upline in Lake Mahopac and the dominant car culture killed the rail service. The old right of way is now part of the North County Trailway, which runs north as far as Carmel, New York. There is currently no rail service in Yorktown, but there are multiple Metro-North Railroad stations nearby, in Katonah in the east on the Harlem Line and Peekskill on the Hudson Line.

One of the New York Central stations was restored and today serves as the centerpiece of a small town park.

Since the 1930s Attica had been a prison town, and most correctional officers live here or nearby with their families.

On September 9, 1971, in the Attica Prison riot, more than 1200 inmates (of 2200) took over control of the prison. They sought to negotiate with authorities to improve living conditions.

<text>Bennington is a town in Wyoming County, New York, United States. The population was 3,235 during the 2020 census. The town was named after Bennington, Vermont.

Geographically, the town of Bennington is the largest in Wyoming County, occupying a significant portion of the county&#x27;s northwest corner.

==History==
The Town of Bennington was formed in 1818 from the Town of Sheldon. The Town of Bennington officially came into existence on March 6, 1818. The name came from Bennington, Vermont.

This narrative was written by :

&quot;In 1802, the land of Bennington was part of the Town of Batavia, Genesee County. Then in 1808, the land was taken from the Town of Batavia, to form the Town of Sheldon. Finally, on March 6, 1818, the land of Bennington was taken from Sheldon to form the Town of Bennington.

In the summer of 1802, John Tolles settled in Bennington. He settled in the area known over the years as Hubbard&#x27;s Corners, Danley&#x27;s Corners and the &quot;Beehive&quot;.

The first frame barn was erected in the township by Jacob Wright in 1805.

By 1806, over twenty families were located in the town. A tannery, shoe shop and blacksmith shop were erected. By 1807, the first school house was built. A sawmill was also built in the south part of the town near the Sheldon Town line. In 1806, Chauncey Loomis purchased large tracts of land in the third and fourth ranges of the township at the price of one dollar per acre, including all the land now known as Bennington Center. During 1807, a sawmill was built in Bennington Center and the first barn raised was built from lumber produced from the mill. Also in 1807, the road from Bennington to Sheldon was cut out.

Approximately nine years after the Loomis family settled in Bennington, Quartus Clapp set out to purchase his own land further west in the town. He selected a site four miles down Cayuga Creek near a waterfall and built a sawmill in 1816 or 1818. He purchased about a hundred acres, which covered more than half of the valley of the hamlet of Cowlesville. At that time it was known as Clapp&#x27;s Mills.

During 1826, Quartus Clapp built a grist mill adjoining his sawmill. This grist mill was the first of its kind in this town.

In 1827, Gaius B. Rich came from Attica and established the first store in Clapp&#x27;s Mills. A young man, Hiram Cowles, clerked in this store in 1831. It was at this store that mail came once a week for the local settlers to pick up. It is believed that Hiram Cowles had a great deal to do in establishing the Post Office at Clapp&#x27;s Mills, for on March 11, 1831, he was appointed Postmaster. In his honor, the settlement received the name of [Cowlesville].

The hamlet of Folsomdale is three miles southwest of Bennington Center. John Fitch came to Folsomdale, built a house, set out an orchard and built a saw and grist mill, about 1823. Little is known about Fitch but his property was purchased in 1825 by David Scott. He began a mercantile and milling business in this area.

When David Scott owned the land Folsomdale is located on, the name of Scottsville was given to it. About 1831, Benjamin Folsom came to Scottsville to manage a store for Mr. Scott. In 1834-1835, Mr. Scott built a tavern. It was later owned and operated by Mr. Folsom and it was after that, the hamlet was named Folsomdale.

The first Bennington town meeting was held in home of David Farnham. The first supervisor for the town was George Loomis.

On January 23, 1875, a meeting was held in Cowlesville with the purpose of dividing the Township into two towns. A resolution was drawn up and presented to the Board of Supervisors. The board, with a vote of ten to five, approved the resolution to create a new town on February 25, 1875. The new township was to be &quot;Elmont&quot;. When the request was sent to the Legislature of New York State, there was some error in proceedings and the proposal died in Albany.

Until the 1930s, town meetings were probably held in the schoolhouse at Bennington Center. In 1936, during Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency, the Works Progress Administration, known as W.P.A., provided jobs in building projects for a long-range value. The Town of Bennington had their town hall built. The federal government furnished the cost of labor for the building. The building is still used for the Town meetings. Several other organizations also use it.

Bennington was mainly a farming community. The 1990 Wyoming County Dairy Princess was from the Town of Bennington.

The Town had several small schools. The last school to close its doors was District #17, located in Cowlesville.

The town of Bennington boasted of six covered bridges to span the Cayuga Creek. The last of the six, known as the Ellis-Chesbro covered bridge, was destroyed by fire on March 17, 1966. It was the last structure of its kind that existed in New York State west of the Finger Lakes. The Ellis-Chesbro Bridge was the location of scenes shot for MGM&#x27;s motion picture &quot;The Great Waltz&quot;.

Frances Folsom, the granddaughter of John B. Folsom, became the First Lady of the United States. She spent much time as a young girl in Folsomdale. Frances Folsom was married to President Grover Cleveland, June 2, 1886, at the White House in Washington, D.C.

The Town of Bennington has had several churches. The first Baptist Church in Bennington Center was erected in 1832, the second in 1857 and that was destroyed by fire in 1886. It was rebuilt in 1887. BY 1925, the membership had diminished to five. The church was sold to the Cowlesville Baptist Society. They dismantled it and rebuilt it as an addition to their church.

The United Church of Christ in Bennington Center was dedicated in 1844. The Sacred Heart Catholic Church was erected at Bennington Center in 1871. The East Bennington Evangelic and United Brethren Church dates back to the early 19th century. The Catholic Church, Our Lady Help of Christians, in East Bennington was built in 1855. The Cowlesville Baptist Church was built in 1872 and an addition was added in 1924 or 1925. Cowlesville also had a Universalist Church which was dedicated in 1845. In 1914, the building was sold to the I.O.O.F. Lodge. It was eventually dismantled. The German Baptist Church was erected in 1869 at Folsomdale. There also was a Free Will Baptist Church in Folsomdale dedicated in 1858. The building was torn down in the early 20th century.

<doc id="127611" wikidata="Q622947" url="?curid=127611" title="Jane's Addiction">
<text>Jane&#x27;s Addiction is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1985. The band consists of singer Perry Farrell, guitarist Dave Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery. Jane&#x27;s Addiction was one of the first bands from the early 1990s alternative rock movement to gain commercial success. 

Founded by Farrell and Avery following the disintegration of Farrell&#x27;s previous band Psi Com, Jane&#x27;s Addiction&#x27;s first release was a live album, &quot;Jane&#x27;s Addiction&quot; (1987), which caught the attention of Warner Bros. Records. Their first two studio albums, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; (1988) and &quot;Ritual de lo Habitual&quot; (1990), received acclaim and grew a cult fanbase. As a result, Jane&#x27;s Addiction became icons of what Farrell dubbed the &quot;Alternative Nation&quot;. The band&#x27;s first farewell tour, in 1991, launched the first Lollapalooza, which has since become a perennial alternative rock festival.

In 1997, Jane&#x27;s Addiction reunited with Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers replacing Avery for a one-off tour. In 2001, a second reunion took place, with Martyn LeNoble and later Chris Chaney on bass. In 2003, Jane&#x27;s Addiction released its third studio album, &quot;Strays&quot;, before dissolving the following year. In 2008, the original lineup reunited and embarked on a world tour. Avery left acrimoniously in early 2010 as they began working on new material. In 2011, they released their fourth studio album, &quot;The Great Escape Artist&quot;, with Chaney returning for its recording and tour. They have toured and performed intermittently since.

In 2022, Avery rejoined Jane&#x27;s Addiction after a 12-year absence. Due to long COVID, Navarro was replaced by the Queens of the Stone Age guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen and the former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Josh Klinghoffer on tours in 2022 and 2023. In 2024, a reunion tour with Navarro was cancelled after Farrell shoved and punched him on-stage during a concert on September 13, 2024 in Boston, Massachusetts.

==History==
===1985–1987: Formation and &quot;Jane&#x27;s Addiction&quot;===
Jane&#x27;s Addiction formed from the remains of frontman Perry Farrell&#x27;s previous band, Psi Com. In mid-1985, Farrell was searching for a bassist to replace Kelly Wheeler in the faltering Psi Com. He was introduced to Eric Avery by Carla Bozulich (later of The Geraldine Fibbers), and the pair bonded over a mutual appreciation of Joy Division and The Velvet Underground. They began to practice together, although Avery never became a full-fledged member of Farrell&#x27;s disintegrating group.

The new band was dubbed &quot;Jane&#x27;s Addiction&quot; in honor of Farrell&#x27;s housemate, Jane Bainter, who was their muse and inspiration. However, the play on words also seems to be there suggesting that &quot;Jane&#x27;s&quot; signifies &quot;Chains&quot;, being a synonym for addiction (i.e. a corrosive habit). &quot;My girlfriend Casey Niccoli and I were sitting in the car,&quot; Farrell recalled, &quot;and we started to think about band names. She threw in Jane&#x27;s Heroin Experience. I thought it wasn&#x27;t vague enough. If you want to invite people in, you don&#x27;t want to put heroin on your door.&quot;

In its formative incarnation, Jane&#x27;s Addiction went through four guitarists and featured Matt Chaikin, formerly of Kommunity FK, on drums.

After Chaikin failed to show up for rehearsals, Farrell sought a new drummer. Avery&#x27;s younger sister Rebecca suggested her boyfriend Stephen Perkins. Avery was uncertain because of their differing tastes in music, but eventually relented. After Perkins was hired, the drummer and Rebecca promised to get their friend Dave Navarro into the group. Based on Perkins&#x27; recommendation, the band auditioned and hired Navarro.

Jane&#x27;s Addiction became a sensation on the Los Angeles club scene, primarily headlining at Scream, and won interest from a variety of record labels. While the group decided to sign with Warner Bros. Records, they insisted on releasing their debut on independent record label Triple X Records first. The band&#x27;s manager negotiated the largest advance up to that point, with Warner Bros. signing the band for between $250,000 to $300,000. In January 1987, the band recorded its debut &quot;Jane&#x27;s Addiction&quot; during a performance at the Roxy Theatre, at a cost of $4,000. Before the album&#x27;s release, Jane&#x27;s Addiction supported British band Love and Rockets on a two-month tour in late 1987. In late 1987, the band opened for former Bauhaus vocalist Peter Murphy at the now demolished Fender&#x27;s Ballroom in Long Beach.

===1988–1989: &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot;===
In January 1988, Jane&#x27;s Addiction went into the studio to record its major label debut and follow-up to &quot;Jane&#x27;s Addiction&quot;, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot;. Warner Bros. gave Jane&#x27;s Addiction a list of producers to choose from, and the group chose Dave Jerden.

&quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; was released in 1988. &quot;Mountain Song&quot; was released as a single; MTV refused to air the song&#x27;s music video because of a scene containing full frontal nudity. Farrell then decided to release the music video commercially with added live footage to create the &quot;Soul Kiss&quot; home video. Because of the lack of airplay on MTV and modern rock radio, the album only sold 200,000 to 250,000 copies in its first year of release.

After the album&#x27;s release, the band went on tour, opening for Iggy Pop and The Ramones. By the end of the tour, Jane&#x27;s Addiction was headlining clubs and theaters.

During the recording sessions, Farrell stated he wanted 50% of the band&#x27;s publishing royalties for writing the lyrics, plus a quarter of the remaining half for writing music, adding up to 62.5%. Bassist Eric Avery said he and the other members – guitarist Dave Navarro and drummer Stephen Perkins – were stunned by these demands. Farrell refused to compromise. One day Jerden drove to the studio to find Farrell, Navarro, and Perkins leaving; Farrell told him the band had broken up and there would be no record. Warner Bros. called an emergency meeting to resolve the situation. Farrell received the royalty percentages he sought, with the other members receiving 12.5 percent each. Avery said the incident had a profound effect on the band, creating an internal fracture.

Not long after the royalties dispute, Farrell and Avery – who had cofounded the band – had a falling-out. This was the result of Avery&#x27;s newfound sobriety as well as an incident in which Farrell believed Avery had drunkenly tried to pick up his girlfriend. &quot;Unfortunately,&quot; Farrell recalled, &quot;the tensions between Eric and I affected the whole family. Some people were asked to take sides, and others just moped about because they didn&#x27;t know what was going on.&quot; Perkins, however, is reported to have got along with Navarro, Avery and Farrell.

===1989–1991: &quot;Ritual de lo Habitual&quot;===
Jane&#x27;s Addiction was scheduled to begin recording its next album in mid-1989. Navarro later stated he had almost no recollection of working on the album due to his addiction to heroin. &quot;Ritual de lo Habitual&quot; was released in 1990. To support it, the band embarked on a lengthy tour. Farrell recalled, &quot;That thirteen-month tour behind &quot;Ritual&quot; was half the reason we wound up unable to stand one another. The other half is that I am an intolerable narcissist who can&#x27;t get along with anyone.&quot;

Part of the tour included headlining the first Lollapalooza festival, which traveled across North America in mid-1991. The festival, created by Farrell and Marc Geiger, was to become a farewell for Jane&#x27;s Addiction, but also a showcase for other cult artists: Siouxsie and the Banshees, Nine Inch Nails, the Butthole Surfers, Living Colour, The Rollins Band, The Violent Femmes, and Ice-T&#x27;s Body Count. The headliners began to get more exposure than ever before: &quot;Been Caught Stealing&quot; and &quot;Stop!&quot; became hits and earned rotation on MTV. During the first Lollapalooza show, Farrell and Navarro got into a fight onstage after violently bumping each other mid-song. The band walked off, but came back to play an encore; however, the fight continued and Navarro eventually threw his guitar into the crowd. Regardless, the band continued the tour and played about 25 more Lollapalooza shows, frequently covering Sly and the Family Stone&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Nigger, Whitey&quot; with Ice-T and Body Count.

Differences between the members on the issue of drug use on the &quot;Ritual&quot; tour led to a schism: Farrell and Perkins regularly partook, while Avery and Navarro abstained. According to &quot;Spin&quot;, between shows, Avery and Navarro sought to avoid temptation by retiring to a section of the tour bus set aside for them. After shows, Avery and Navarro (and Navarro&#x27;s wife at the time, Tanya) would retire to their hotel. &quot;They have,&quot; said &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;simply learned that they cannot use drugs of any kind anymore without becoming slaves to them, and that slavery is death.&quot;

In late 1991, Avery told Navarro that he planned to leave. Navarro quickly agreed to do the same. The two told their management, who in turn tried to convince them to play in Japan, but Avery and Navarro only wanted to play as much as was contractually obligated. The band played its last shows in Australia and Hawaii before disbanding. &quot;It&#x27;s weird to be at the end of a cycle like that,&quot; remarked Avery, &quot;having run the gamut of the usual &#x27;rock story&#x27; from beginning to end: you get signed, get strung out, break up.&quot;

===1997: First reunion and &quot;Kettle Whistle&quot;===
Dave Navarro joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1993 and during a hiatus for the band, Navarro along with Chili Peppers&#x27;s Flea joined Porno for Pyros to record &quot;Hard Charger&quot; in 1997 for Howard Stern&#x27;s movie, &quot;Private Parts&quot; soundtrack. This led to a brief Jane&#x27;s Addiction Relapse tour, with Flea replacing Avery who declined an invitation to rejoin the band. They produced a compilation album titled &quot;Kettle Whistle&quot; featuring two new songs with Flea on bass. In 2010, Perkins stated that &quot;Flea, to me, was a great match in &#x27;97. As a drummer, he was very exciting for me to work with.&quot;

===2001–2004: &quot;Strays&quot;===
&quot;I got a phone call from a promoter who asked me if I would be interested in re-forming the band for the Coachella festival in LA,&quot; said Farrell in 2001, &quot;and taking the band on tour after that... This comes at a time when this record &quot;Song Yet to Be Sung&quot; is about to be plucked. Perkins played on three of the songs, and Navarro played with Steve on the single. So there are plans for Jane&#x27;s&#x27; summer tour.&quot;

The consequent 2001 Jubilee Tour featured largely the classics, alongside &quot;Hungry&quot; from Navarro&#x27;s &quot;Trust No One&quot; and &quot;Happy Birthday Jubilee&quot; from &quot;Song Yet to Be Sung&quot;. Fans were told to expect a &quot;Sexual Psycho Circus... half-naked, penny rafters, guitar solos, and tribal drums...&quot; Indeed, during &#x27;Classic Girl&#x27;, scantily clad stage dancers filled the arenas. Avery declined to be involved. Since Flea was busy with the Chili Peppers, Porno for Pyros bassist Martyn LeNoble was enlisted. (Fellow Pyros member Peter DiStefano guested at one show, to play &quot;Pets&quot;.)

Following the success of this tour, the band decided to record a follow-up album to &quot;Ritual De Lo Habitual&quot; and tapped Chris Chaney to replace LeNoble on bass. They entered the studio with producer Bob Ezrin in 2001, recording as a band for the first time in over 10 years. The result was a fourth album, &quot;Strays&quot;. Some of the songs (or parts of songs) dated far back in the band&#x27;s history, while others were new. Reaction was generally favorable, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reporting that &quot;The band sounds familiar&quot; and &quot;beefier&quot; though without the &quot;glint of madness&quot; of the original line-up. The first single, &quot;Just Because&quot;, reached number 72 on the Billboard Hot 100, while &quot;Superhero&quot; garnered exposure as the theme for HBO&#x27;s hit series &quot;Entourage&quot;.

The band spent 2003 on an extensive worldwide tour in support of &quot;Strays&quot;, including a summer headliner slot in a reincarnated Lollapalooza U.S. tour. Following this homecoming of sorts, Jane&#x27;s Addiction once again broke up towards the end of 2003 after canceling several dates. Although details surrounding the band&#x27;s demise are sparse, Navarro claimed on his website, in June 2004, that the reasons were essentially the same as they were in 1991. Perkins later stated, &quot;We always break up if it&#x27;s not real. We really can&#x27;t fake it, We can make a million dollars for three months touring but we would fucking hate each other, which isn&#x27;t good. Even with the nostalgia, it&#x27;s not worth it if it doesn&#x27;t sound good, or look good. One of the things with Jane&#x27;s is that we have never been good at faking it.&quot;

A hits album – &quot;Up from the Catacombs – The Best of Jane&#x27;s Addiction&quot; – was released on September 19, 2006.

===2008–2010: Return of Eric Avery and NIN/JA Tour===

Jane&#x27;s Addiction performed at the first-ever NME Awards USA on April 23, 2008, with the reunited core line-up of Perry Farrell, Dave Navarro, Eric Avery, and Stephen Perkins. This was the first performance with bassist Eric Avery since 1991, taking place after their acceptance speech for the &quot;Godlike Genius Award&quot;. To follow this up, the original line up performed their first full set in 17 years in Los Angeles on October 23, 2008, at La Cita Bar, and played two further club gigs at the El Cid in Los Angeles on November 20. and the Echoplex on February 16, 2009. On April 11, 2009, they had a birthday bash for Perry that included members of Jane&#x27;s Addiction and Porno for Pyros on the same stage; the bash was nicknamed Perrypalooza.

Around this time, photos of Farrell, Navarro, Avery and Perkins, taken by Trent Reznor, appeared on Nine Inch Nails&#x27; official website, leading to speculation that Reznor could be helping Jane&#x27;s Addiction record new material. &quot;He did his best to be both producer and psychologist,&quot; Farrell said, in a &quot;Billboard&quot; report about tension between himself and Avery. &quot;He was very respectful, trying to get out of the way and not overproduce. I wish honestly he would&#x27;ve produced a little more, but he was a little gun-shy after seeing us explode on each other in the studio. He became the referee for a day and after that day I think he was done.&quot; Nonetheless, Reznor subsequently posted a blog entry announcing that Jane&#x27;s Addiction would accompany Nine Inch Nails on their summer 2009 tour, which kicked off on May 8 in West Palm Beach, Florida.

To accompany the tour, newly recorded versions of &quot;Chip Away&quot; and &quot;Whores&quot; were released for free via the official tour website. Farrell explained: &quot;To get some creative juice flowing, we went into the studio for about two weeks. We had the idea to re-record two tunes, just because they&#x27;d never been done officially in the studio. And we had some fun writing some new things. A handful that are close to finished, but not quite done. But there&#x27;s no rush to put anything out at this point.&quot; Navarro blogged: &quot;We wanted to give our longtime listeners something to celebrate the tour and &#x27;Whores&#x27; has always been one of the tracks that defined Jane&#x27;s early on.&quot;

A retrospective box set, &quot;A Cabinet of Curiosities&quot;, was released to coincide with the NIN/JA tour in April 2009.

In July 2009, Jane&#x27;s Addiction was scheduled to play the Splendour in the Grass festival in Australia when a health issue forced a last-minute cancellation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jane&#x27;s Addiction cancel Australian show/s&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Music Feeds reports that an arm infection, probably that of drummer Stephen Perkins, is the cause of the cancellation. The entire Australian leg of the Jane&#x27;s Addiction 2009 world tour was cancelled, though Jane&#x27;s Addiction would play the next year&#x27;s Splendour in the Grass.

Jane&#x27;s Addiction performed at the 2009 Voodoo Fest held at City Park in New Orleans, Louisiana over Halloween weekend. The concert was filmed and a year later released as &quot;Live Voodoo&quot; DVD, which received mixed reviews. &quot;It all falls rather flat, a two-dimensional sound robbing the likes of &#x27;Ocean Size&#x27; and &#x27;Ted, Just Admit It&#x27; of any sense of dynamics,&quot; Phil Mongredien of &quot;Q&quot; wrote.

Jane&#x27;s Addiction returned to Australia in February 2010 for the Soundwave Festival. Avery left the band following the festival, stating: &quot;That&#x27;s it. With equal parts regret and relief, the Jane&#x27;s Addiction experiment is at an end.&quot;

===2010–2012: &quot;The Great Escape Artist&quot;===
The band began working with Guns N&#x27; Roses bassist Duff McKagan on new material. with a picture of the group working together posted on Navarro&#x27;s Twitter page. It was later confirmed by Dave Navarro on his Dark Matter radio program that McKagan had indeed joined Jane&#x27;s Addiction on a permanent basis.

The new lineup of Jane&#x27;s Addiction made their debut, performing at singer Perry Farrell&#x27;s 51st birthday celebration, at Les Deux in Los Angeles, California on March 30.

In April 2010, the group announced two European dates, scheduled for June, taking place at the GelreDome, in Arnhem, Netherlands, and an appearance at the Rock in Rio in Madrid, Spain. Preceding these shows in Europe was a one-off Cinco de Mayo concert that took place at the Bardot in Hollywood, California on Wednesday, May 5, 2010. During the show, they debuted a new song titled &quot;Soulmate&quot;. In September 2010 McKagan left the band.

On September 25, 2010, Jane&#x27;s Addiction performed a live set for &quot;Guitar Center Sessions&quot; on DirecTV. The episode included an interview with the band by program host, Nic Harcourt.

On January 5, 2011, the band announced that they had recruited TV on the Radio guitarist and producer Dave Sitek as a replacement for Duff McKagan. Sitek was set to record the bass for the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, entitled &quot;The Great Escape Artist&quot;. On January 14, 2011, while talking about the recording of the new album, drummer Stephen Perkins mentioned that although Sitek was a &quot;stabilizing force&quot; for Jane&#x27;s Addiction, and was to appear on the upcoming album, he was not the band&#x27;s full-time bassist as was previously reported. It was then confirmed that Sitek would not be touring with the band, which was set to promote the album on a summer tour, including headlining Reading and Leeds Festivals. These sets would later be cancelled due to Farrell&#x27;s illness. It was then announced that Chris Chaney would be the band&#x27;s live bassist for some shows in 2011. On March 30, 2011, a song from &quot;The Great Escape Artist&quot;, titled &quot;End to the Lies&quot; was premiered on the Chilean radio station Radio Futuro, and was also performed at Lollapalooza Chile on April 3, 2011. On April 8, &quot;End to the Lies&quot; was released via their website as free to download. On July 23, 2011, the band headlined the Gathering of the Vibes Music and Arts festival in Bridgeport, Connecticut. On August 3, 2011, the band released the second single entitled &quot;Irresistible Force&quot;. The initial release date for new album was scheduled for September 27, 2011, but was postponed until October. &quot;The Great Escape Artist&quot; was released on October 18, 2011. In an interview with Jason Tanamor, guitarist Dave Navarro said, &quot;This album is different because the band went in a new direction that we haven&#x27;t been in before but at the same time there are many familiar threads of where we used to come from. It&#x27;s an evolution from where we were but always remembering where we came from.&quot;

Jane&#x27;s Addiction launched their Theatre of the Escapists Tour in 2012 to a sold-out crowd at the 2,000 seat Pageant Theatre in St. Louis, Missouri. In February 2012, Perry Farrell discussed the possibility of releasing a follow-up to &quot;The Great Escape Artist&quot; while touring in support of the album, stating, &quot;What I have not seen before is a group that&#x27;s done a record, had somewhat of a theme – escapism – and then done a second record almost as if it was a follow-up movie. I want to do that. We have material left from &quot;The Great Escape Artist&quot; we didn&#x27;t record. I&#x27;m very inspired to keep with the theme. Something&#x27;s feeling right about it.&quot;

In 2012, the band contributed a studio cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1968 song &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; to the television series &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;.

===2013–2021: Continued activity and anniversary touring===

After finishing up touring in support of &quot;The Great Escape Artist&quot;, the band remained active with several subsequent tours, releases and band-related projects. They released their second live album, &quot;Live in NYC&quot;, on July 8, 2013, recorded during their &quot;Theatre of Escapists&quot; tour. On August 8, 2013, they released a stand-alone studio single, called &quot;Another Soulmate&quot;, which they had previously performed live during Duff McKagen&#x27;s brief tenure as bass guitarist in 2010. Later that year, Jane&#x27;s Addiction was awarded with the 2,509th star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame on October 30, 2013. Their star is located at 6436 Hollywood Boulevard.

In 2014, the band embarked upon a tour performing &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; in full. In 2016, they launched the Sterling Spoon Anniversary Tour, celebrating the 25th anniversary of &quot;Ritual De Lo Habitual&quot; and Lollapalooza. Special guests on the tour included Dinosaur Jr., Living Colour, and Fishbone. A live album from this tour, &quot;Alive at Twenty-Five&quot;, was released on August 4, 2017.

On February 6, 2020, ten seconds of a song entitled &quot;Laughing Beats&quot; (also referred to as &quot;Embrace the Darkness&quot;) was played by Dave Navarro&#x27;s guitar tech Dan Cleary on Rare Form Radio. The song was recorded with Eric Avery and produced by Trent Reznor in 2009, prompting speculation that the song could be released in full in the near future.

On February 8, 2020, Jane&#x27;s Addiction performed for the first time in over two years at a memorial show for Andrew Burkle, son of billionaire Ronald Burkle, who died in January 2020. The band was joined on stage by John Frusciante for &quot;Mountain Song&quot;. Frusciante was there performing with the Red Hot Chili Peppers for the first time in 13 years after recently rejoining the band. Stephen Perkins also filled in for Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith during their performance due to Smith being unable to attend due to an art show appearance.

===2022–2023: Eric Avery&#x27;s second return and Navarro&#x27;s absence===
On May 11, 2022, the Smashing Pumpkins announced the Spirits on Fire Tour, a 32-date trek across America with Jane&#x27;s Addiction, starting in Dallas on October 2 and wrapping up in Los Angeles at the Hollywood Bowl on November 19. After contracting COVID-19 in December 2021, Dave Navarro continued to suffer health complications from long COVID, causing the band to cancel their planned summer festival appearances at Welcome to Rockville and Lollapallooza. Farrell and Perkins reformed Porno for Pyros to replace the band at both events, leading to a full reunion of Porno for Pyros&#x27; original line-up.
Upon reuniting Porno for Pyros, Perry Farrell stated that he would also like to see Jane&#x27;s Addiction record new material in 2022 in addition to touring. On August 17, 2022, the band revealed on Instagram that founding bass guitarist Eric Avery had returned to Jane&#x27;s Addiction after a twelve-year absence. Later that week, Avery confirmed that the band were working on new material: &quot;Four promising new song ideas. Big thanks to you all for all the kind words of support. It leaves me feeling inspired. Honestly. It produces the best kind of pressure, your passion leaves me determined to do all I can for Jane&#x27;s Addiction.&quot;

Avery&#x27;s surprise return was revealed to have been tentatively in the works since 2020, with Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins helping facilitate phone calls between Farrell and Avery for a possible reunion in honour of Lollapalooza&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 2021. Farrell envisioned the band becoming a five-piece with then-current bass guitarist Chris Chaney remaining in the band alongside Avery. Avery resisted the scenario, and despite Farrell and Avery coming to a peaceful understanding with one another, the original line-up of Jane&#x27;s Addiction did not reunite due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Following Taylor Hawkins&#x27; death in March 2022, Farrell reached out to Avery: &quot;He presented this idea of me returning to Jane&#x27;s, and how we would do it. He was like, &#x27;Here&#x27;s a few years&#x27; plan of how to return some luster to Jane&#x27;s Addiction.&#x27; It involved writing new music and playing shows. I told him that I&#x27;d take the next step, whatever that is.&quot; Avery elaborated, &quot;We had what I considered to be the most meaningful and honest and respectful talk that we&#x27;ve had since the Jane&#x27;s 1.0 days. I don&#x27;t mean to sound so &#x27;new age-y&#x27; about it, but it was sort of a healing of a rift.&quot; With Avery returning to the band, Chaney was let go after an eleven-year tenure. The split became acrimonious between Farrell and Chaney: &quot;Chris knew that this day would come because we talked about it. When Taylor died, things really changed in our relationship. We can definitely call it &#x27;estranged.&#x27; I do not have a good separation with Chris Chaney, that&#x27;s for sure.&quot;

Days prior to the band&#x27;s Spirits on Fire tour with the Smashing Pumpkins, Dave Navarro announced that he wouldn&#x27;t be performing with the band due to his ongoing struggles with long COVID: &quot;I had hoped for a full recovery by October but I am still very fatigued and will not be able to join this leg. I am personally gutted as our original bass player has returned, Eric Avery. We wanted to bring you the original line-up but that will have to wait until I am recovered. While the band is touring, I will be working on some new Jane&#x27;s material in the studio here in LA.&quot; For the duration of the tour, Navarro was replaced by Queens of the Stone Age guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, with Navarro noting: &quot;He is a great guy and I am honoured to have him help make this tour happen.&quot; Avery remarked: &quot;Troy is much grittier in every way. There&#x27;s sort of like a working-man grit to his playing, and to his sound,&quot; elaborating, &quot;This is an opportunity for Jane&#x27;s to have a little bit of a different sound. A little bit of a different experience.&quot; As the tour progressed, former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Josh Klinghoffer and Bauhaus&#x27; Daniel Ash joined the band for select moments during the set, with Farrell noting: &quot;They&#x27;re guitar peers, shall we say, of Jane&#x27;s. Friends first and foremost, but musical allies for sure.&quot;

Following the completion of the tour, the band entered the studio with producers James Ford and Peter Robinson to work on new material. Farrell, Avery and Perkins contributed to the recordings, with open invitations offered to Navarro and recent touring guitarists Van Leeuwen, Klinghoffer and Ash to work on the new material. Farrell noted: &quot;I don&#x27;t know who will end up recording the guitar tracks, but I&#x27;d love to see Dave, Troy, Josh and Daniel contribute — all the guys on the tour that really stuck it out.&quot; In January 2023, Klinghoffer was announced as Navarro&#x27;s full replacement for their 2023 tour dates.

===2024: Reunion tour, stage altercation and hiatus ===
On May 23, 2024, the classic Jane&#x27;s Addiction line-up of Farrell, Navarro, Avery and Perkins performed at the 400-capacity Bush Hall in London, marking the first time the four-piece had performed together since 2010. The band debuted new material at the show, their first with Avery in thirty-four years, ahead of a full European tour. Both &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;NME&quot;, awarded five-star reviews to the band&#x27;s performance at London&#x27;s Roundhouse, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; writing: &quot;They’ve not sounded this vivid and alive in decades. It might finally be time to believe in Jane&#x27;s Addiction again – after all, they clearly do,&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; describing them as &quot;a force to be reckoned with&quot;. Navarro said &quot;some of those UK club dates are among my favorite Jane’s Addiction shows that I’ve ever played&quot;.

Jane&#x27;s Addiction announced a US tour, with support from Love and Rockets, with whom the band had previously toured in 1987. On July 24, 2024, they released the single &quot;Imminent Redemption&quot;, the first original song with Avery in 34 years. The band stated: &quot;It is different this time. To have everyone back together, releasing new music. It&#x27;s time. Welcome to the next chapter of Jane&#x27;s Addiction. &#x27;Imminent Redemption&#x27; is only the beginning.&quot; The band confirmed that they had been working on several other new songs, with Avery saying he was &quot;guardedly optimistic&quot; that they could complete new music: &quot;The phrase that Dave and I were talking about the other day is: &#x27;If there is a Jane&#x27;s Addiction in 2025, then there will be new music for sure.&#x27; But you just never know if there&#x27;s going to be a band at all.&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that there were tensions between band members when they played in New York City in September. On September 13, a concert at Leader Bank Pavilion in Boston was cut short after Farrell shoved and punched Navarro and was restrained by the crew members. Farrell&#x27;s wife, Etty Lau Farrell, said Farrell had been suffering from tinnitus and a sore throat and felt his voice was being drowned out by the band. The following day, Jane&#x27;s Addiction issued an apology and canceled their scheduled show at Bridgeport, Connecticut. On September 16, they canceled the remainder of the tour and said they would &quot;take some time away as a group&quot;. Navarro, Avery and Perkins released a joint statement attributing the cancellation to Farrell&#x27;s behavior and mental health, while Farrell released an apology, saying his behavior was &quot;inexcusable&quot;.

On September 18, the band released a second new song with the reunited line-up, &quot;True Love&quot;, which had been scheduled for release prior to the band&#x27;s hiatus. After several months of inactivity, on December 25, Navarro and Avery re-released their 1994 &quot;Deconstruction&quot; album on music streaming services for the first time, with &quot;Spin&quot; naming it a &quot;quiet masterpiece&quot; in an accompanying feature. On January 3, 2025, it was revealed that Avery, Navarro and Perkins were working on new music together, without the participation of Farrell.

==Musical style and influences==
Often associated with alternative rock, Jane&#x27;s Addiction is credited for the mainstream exposure of the alternative music scene in the 1990s. The band has also been associated with such genres as funk-punk and funk metal.

According to Navarro, each of the band&#x27;s members has (for the most part) unique influences: &quot;we&#x27;ve never been on the same page in terms of our personal tastes, any one of us. We all have different record collections, with a few bands we land on at the same time - classic Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and [Rolling] Stones. We all kind of come together in that one little genre, but apart from that everything we love and are influenced by as individuals is completely different.&quot;

Talking about &quot;Ritual de lo Habitual&quot;, Alice Cooper remarked, &quot;I can spot traces of other people on this album, us included, but that&#x27;s all they are: traces. They were a really original band. This is their peak album, where they really went out on a limb. Sometimes I get so caught up in these songs, I can actually feel the band pushing themselves to their limits. Sometimes I can&#x27;t believe how strong it is. I wonder if this will have the same effect on some kid as Chuck Berry had on me ...&quot;

==Legacy and influence==
Jane&#x27;s Addiction is regarded as one of the most influential acts in alternative music. Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine compared the band&#x27;s influence to that of Nirvana. Artists influenced by Jane&#x27;s Addiction include Tool, Korn, the Smashing Pumpkins, Limp Bizkit, Candlebox, P.O.D., Oceansize, Paul Banks of Interpol, Nothingface, Stabbing Westward, Incubus, System of a Down, Devin Townsend and Strapping Young Lad.

&quot;&quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; influenced me a lot, especially with what Eric Avery proposed from the bass,&quot; said Nick Oliveri, of Queens of the Stone Age, Kyuss and Mondo Generator. &quot;Eric had written the music on his own, the guitars and the drums came later. So he inspired me on that side, it is very possible that they were the first really alternative band.&quot; In a dissenting appraisal from 1993, the Sugar bassist David Barbe said Jane&#x27;s Addiction was not &quot;alternative&quot; and described them as &quot;corporate dick rock. It&#x27;s Van Halen with different makeup artists.&quot;

==Side projects==

The band members pursued other projects in the 1990s. Farrell and Perkins formed another band, Porno for Pyros, and had some success with their two albums, &quot;Porno for Pyros&quot; (1993) and &quot;Good God&#x27;s Urge&quot; (1996); meanwhile, Avery and Navarro formed Deconstruction and put out a self-titled one-off album in 1994. Dave Navarro joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1993 and in the same year Stephen Perkins started a band named Banyan, with core members Nels Cline, Mike Watt, and Willie Waldman (with revolving studio guests). Banyan has released three albums, their self titled-debut, &quot;Anytime At All&quot; and &quot;Live at Perkins&#x27; Palace&quot;.

During their second major split, the band were involved in a number of other projects. Navarro, Perkins, and Chaney formed a new band, The Panic Channel, with singer Steve Isaacs, who together released one album, titled &quot;(ONe)&quot;, in 2006. Perry Farrell, together with his wife Etty Lau Farrell and Extreme guitarist Nuno Bettencourt, formed Satellite Party. The band signed with Columbia Records and released their debut album, &quot;Ultra Payloaded&quot; in 2007. Eric Avery signed with Dangerbird Records for the release of his solo album &quot;Help Wanted&quot; in 2008.

<text>Middlesex is a town in Yates County, New York, USA. The population was 1,495 at the 2010 census. The name originates from a historic region of the UK.

The Town of Middlesex is on the northwest corner of the county and is south of Canandaigua, New York.

== History ==
A legend of the Seneca tribe states that they originated in a village called Nundawao, near the south end of Canandaigua Lake, at South Hill. Right next to South Hill stands the 865-foot-high Bare Hill, known to the Senecas as Genundowa. Bare Hill is part of the Bare Hill Unique Area, which began to be acquired by the state in 1989. Bare Hill had been the site of a Seneca or pre-Seneca fort; first written reference to this fort was made in 1825 by David Cusick in his history of the Seneca Indians.

In the early 1920s, the material that made up the Bare Hill fort was used by the Town of Middlesex highway department for road fill.

The first settlers arrived around 1789. The town was formed in 1796 while still part of Ontario County, New York. The town was known as &quot;Augusta&quot; until 1808, when the name was changed to &quot;Middlesex&quot; to avoid confusion with another location named Augusta. When Yates County was formed in 1823, Middlesex became part of the new county.

The Town of Potter was formed from part of Middlesex in 1832, and more of Middlesex was added to Potter in 1856.

The Bates Cobblestone Farmhouse, John Carr House, Asahel Green Farm, Middlesex Center Methodist Church, Overackers Corners Schoolhouse, and Vine Valley Methodist Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Penn Yan is an incorporated village and the county seat of Yates County, New York, United States. The population was 5,159 at the 2010 census. It lies at the north end of the east branch of Keuka Lake, one of the Finger Lakes. Penn Yan, New York is home to one of the oldest mills in the United States, The Birkett Mills, founded in 1797.

The Village of Penn Yan is primarily in the Town of Milo, but a small section is in the Town of Benton. A smaller section is in the Town of Jerusalem. The Penn Yan Airport is south of the village. The name &quot;Penn Yan&quot; is a syllabic abbreviation of &quot;Pennsylvania Yankee&quot;. It houses the Penn Yan Central School District.

==History==
The first frame dwelling at Penn Yan was built in 1799. The village became the county seat in 1823, when Yates County was created. It was incorporated in 1833.

The first settlers were chiefly followers of the Public Universal Friend, a religious enthusiast born in Cumberland, Providence County, Rhode Island, who obtained a large tract for a settlement (called Jerusalem in 1789) in the present Yates County, and founded the village of Hopeton on the outlet of Keuka Lake, approximately one mile from Seneca Lake. Many followers settled there, and lived there after 1790, but the community gradually broke up.

Penn Yan, the name of the village, is said to have been contrived from the first syllables of &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; and &quot;Yankee&quot;, as most of the early settlers were from Pennsylvania and New England; the latter were known as Yankees. It became a trading center for the agricultural county, with mills for lumber, buckwheat and other grains. The village was the western terminus of the former Crooked Lake Canal.

In 1921, the Penn Yan Boat Company was founded by German immigrant Charles A. Herrman. It produced wooden and glass-fiber boats until 2001.

During the late 1800s and through the mid-to-late 1900s, Penn Yan and surrounding Yates County areas were home to a large number of dairy farms, many settled by Danish immigrants and their descendants. Even today, names such as Christensen and Jensen are common. Since the late 20th century, Old Order Mennonite and Amish families have settled and taken over farms in the region. Beginning in 1974, many families of the Groffdale Conference Mennonite Church moved to Yates County from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, seeking cheaper farmland. The Yates County Old Order Mennonites settlement is the largest horse-and-buggy community in the state of New York. There are also several Old Order Amish settlements in adjacent Steuben and Seneca counties, which were founded starting in 1979.

On May 13, 2014, heavy downpours caused severe flash flooding in the area, which ripped out roads as well as destroying at least one commercial building downtown as about five inches of rain fell over a few hours, considered to be at least a 100-year flood.

<text>Potter is a town in Yates County, New York, United States. The Town of Potter is located in the northwest part of the county and is south of Canandaigua. The population was 1,865 at the 2010 census.
== History ==
Potter was founded on April 26, 1832, when the town separated from nearby the Town of Middlesex. Previously, the region as a whole was known as District of Augusta. The town was initially known as &quot;Potter&#x27;s Town,&quot; as the area had been purchased by Arnold Potter a son of Judge William Potter. In December 1856, and additional were taken from Middlesex (Modern Potter contains ).

Early settlers of the time included Rowes Perry, Benjamin Brown, Jesse Brown and Joshua Brown, Elias Gilbert, Jabez French, Abraham Lane, Isaac Lane and Jacob Lane, Francis Briggs and Peleg Briggs, Jr., Edward Craft, David Southerland and John Griffin. 
Around 1805, Griffin and Riggs operated an ashery store and a distillery north of Nettle Valley, on what would eventually become the Erwin Wells farm in 1929. Riggs left, and in 1812, Griffin sold the operation to his brother-in-law, Richard M. Williams. Williams became an associate judge of Yates County; he largely concentrated on the manufacture of potash and whisky, and died on June 4, 1837. Williams&#x27; son, Richard H. Williams, was elected to the state senate in 1845, and served for two years before his term was cut short by the adoption of the 1846 constitution.

Luke Conley also built a distillery in Nettle Valley some time after his arrival in Potter in 1805. Around 1810, he sold this building to Arnold Potter, and it was moved to Potter&#x27;s Hollow, or Yatesville. For five years, he worked for Judge Potter in payment for on lot four of the second range. Mr. Conley was also associated with William B. Rochester and aided in laying the foundation for the first mill in Rochester, New York.

In Potter Center around 1790, there was at first a double log tavern, operated by one Bingham, believed to be Col. Luther Bingham, which was located just north of the hamlet on what is now Middle Rd. The tavern sat on the knoll on the east side of the road and just north of the Potter Center Schoolhouse #11. Mr. Bingham operated the tavern even before wagon roads were open. He was succeeded by Alben Darby who remained many years and died there. Many older documents refer to &quot;Darby&#x27;s Corners,&quot; which was the intersection of what we now call Simmons, Mothersell and Middle Rd. to the north of Potter Center.

In 1798, Lindsey Warfield established the &quot;Warfield Neighborhood&quot; which included, in part, land that would later become the township of Middlesex. Mr. Warfield&#x27;s residence was on a farm previously owned by Benjamin Watkins. His house was at the southeast corner of Ward Simmons and NY Route 247. The foundation of a house still remains there. His son, Lindsey D. Warfield, is listed in the 1876 Yates County Atlas at that site. The house burned in 1897 and was previously used as a tavern and public meeting place for town meetings. Other early settlers in the Warfield Neighborhood were a Mr. Wesson, William Foster, and Abraham Florence. Others were James Southerland, Jacob Voorhees, Peter Lamoreaux, Henry VanWormer who in 1796 settled on the Darwin B. Holbrook farm, which is now owned by the Pendleton family. Hendricks younger brother Jan VanWormer settled in about 1801.

Dr. Frederic Dutch was a native of Germany. He came to Potter around 1800 and settled on that eventually became the hamlet of Voak or The Dutch Settlement Dr. Dutch was a German Lutheran and helped to organize the German Lutheran Church at Voak. It is important to distinguish that it was not a &quot;Dutch settlement.&quot; It was a settlement of German Lutherans. At that location there is mention of the &quot;German Meeting House&quot; in 1816, where a Christopher Bergstresser settled near.

Other smaller settlements were Moontown and Hoardtown, which were basically the same location. These were not established villages. They were settlements highly populated by the Moon and Hoard family. It was basically the area of the intersections of Voorhees, West Swamp and Reynolds roads. There was a church on the north side of the intersection of Voorhees and West Swamp as early as 1810. The 1876 Yates County Atlas has it located on what now is the Artlip property. The school was originally located on the southeast corner. Later it was on the southwest corner.

In 1802 Dr. Jareb Dyer purchased that extended from the Willis Dyer Corners, west of the road, north beyond what would later become Potter Center. At that time there were no houses nearer than Warfield&#x27;s Corners to the north and Aberham Lane to the south. Samuel Wyman settled in Nettle Valley in 1809 where Enoch Bordwell and George Green built a sawmill and a log house.

Sanford Strobridge came to Potter in 1826 and at first settled one mile (1.6 km) north of Potter Center. He was a wheelwright and a chair maker. In 1838 he resided in Potter Center and owned a gristmill known as the &quot;Gully Mill&quot; located at the southeast corner of Hagerty Rd. and Rt. 364. His son George would later operate the gristmill. The foundation of that mill can still be found. Arnold Potter, a son of Judge William Potter built the first sawmill in 1794 at Potter Center. Sanford had eleven children. Sanford D. Strobridge; Lyman H. Strobridge, who planted the first vineyard in Potter; Samuel G. Strobridge, who lived where the old Olsen Farm is; George W. Strobridge, who was a wagon maker; and William M. Strobridge, who was a soldier killed in the American Civil War. The carriage or wagon shop owned by George W. Strobridge was located at the point where West Swamp Rd. and Rt. 364 meet. The carriage shop was a three-story building that was later opened in 1928 as the Blodgett Bean House. Still later that same building was used as a feed mill outlet for a milling company based in Rushville. It was torn down in 1968. Directly behind his wagon shop was a blacksmith shop belonging to Eben and Thomas Finch in 1825 and later. It was also a three-story building with a planked incline on the north side.

The Strobridge sawmill site at Hagerty Rd and the grist mill further down stream were driven by water from Mill Brook. When the mills were in operation, they made use of a dike west of Hagerty Rd. that must have also served as a bridge for that same road. The dike held the water back to the marsh in the gully towards Middlesex.

Another early mill was the sawmill that was upstream from the current Tony Hiler residence. This saw mill, based on location, was likely converted from the early grist mill shown in early maps. It was said to have wooden gears and no metal. Some of the beams and siding of the mill were used by Tony Hiler to repair his house, and make the lean-to additions. According to a conversation between Carl Simmons and Tony Hiler, the Simmons, Hiler and George Clark house were built from the wood cut at this mill. The Hiler house was built in 1850. The old or main part of the Simmons home was built in 1831. This is believed to be the sawmill referred to in a 1913 newspaper as being operated by Culver, Barber and Barrett. As early as 1868 the assessment records show the mill belonging to Barber and Burnett. By 1874 it was registered as belonging to Oscar Burnett. At some point it was also used as a feed mill.

In 1825, Milton Finch bought a lot from Henry Husted and established a public house, or tavern, and a blacksmith shop in Potter Center which he and his father, Ebenezer Finch ran. The tavern was located where the McDonald Hotel stood. It was first known as Finch&#x27;s Tavern. Cleveland’s book states that he was succeeded by Mark Weare, and Weare by Peleg Thomas. In 1879, the tavern burned and was later replaced by the McDonald Hotel. On the same night the store of John W. Durham and the George Fitzwater building also burned.

About 1836, Cyrus Daines, James Stout and one Silvernail purchased land in Potter Center off Henry Husted and each established a business and a residence. These were the first buildings in Potter Center. Daines opened a blacksmith shop, Stout, a shoe shop and Silvernail, a tailor shop. The first store was kept by James Turner who was succeeded by Cyrus Daines who continued until his death in 1870. Richard H. Williams built a house and store, which was long occupied by Daines. The 1876 Atlas shows that Daines&#x27;s store was on the east side of the road across from the hotel. The garage owned by Henry Eckert was in Cyrus Dains’s old store, which burned in 1931.

Peleg Thomas built a store on the west side of the road, which was later used as a Union Store. In 1836 in Potter Center there was a Methodist church, a Baptist church, two blacksmith shops, two wagon shops, one harness shop, other mechanics and one store. In 1928 James Blodgett opened a bean plant at the location of the old Aaron Gleason and Hobart carriage shop. The Aaron Gleason and Hobart carriage shop was the same building as the previous George Strobridge carriage shop.

A Post Office was established in Potter Center around 1835. It was located in several places, usually at the store of whoever was appointed Postmaster. Richard M. Williams was the first postmaster. It was his work that established a route from Canandaigua through Rushville, Potter, Naples, Blood&#x27;s Corners, Liberty, and Prattsburg. He had stores at most of these locations.&lt;
The James Hobart House, Arnold Potter House, and Yatesville Methodist Church and the Roundstone Schoolhouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
Alamance was the site of the largest conflict of the War of the Regulation on May 16, 1771. Governor William Tryon&#x27;s decisive victory over a force of 2,000 Regulators effectively ended the war (Battle of Alamance). The region around Alamance was also the site of a defeat of British Loyalists in the American Revolutionary War in a skirmish known as Pyle&#x27;s Massacre on February 25, 1781.

Alamance played a significant role in the development of the textile industry in the South. In 1837 Edwin Michael Holt, son of a local farmer, built the Alamance Cotton Mill at Alamance. In 1849, Holt began converting this spinning mill into a looming mill that produced the well-known &quot;Alamance Plaids.&quot; This was the first factory-dyed cotton cloth produced south of the Potomac. The Holt family subsequently built scores of mills across the state, as well as becoming involved in banking, railroads, politics and other ventures.

The Alamance Battleground State Historic Site, Alamance Mill Village Historic District, and L. Banks Holt House, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The name is said to have been given by German settlers, from the Native American word &quot;allamanca.&quot;

<text>Burlington is a city in Alamance and Guilford counties in the U.S. state of North Carolina. It is the principal city of the Burlington, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses all of Alamance County, in which most of the city is located, and is a part of the Greensboro–Winston-Salem–High Point, NC Combined Statistical Area. The population was 57,303 at the 2020 census, which makes Burlington the 18th-most populous city in North Carolina.

==History==


Alamance County was created when Orange County was partitioned in 1849. Early settlers included several groups of Quakers, many of which remain active in the Snow Camp area, German farmers, and Scots-Irish immigrants.

The need of the North Carolina Railroad in the 1850s to locate land where they could build, repair and do maintenance on its track was the genesis of Burlington, North Carolina. The company selected a piece of land slightly west of present-day Graham. On January 29, 1856, the last spikes were driven into the final tie of the North Carolina Railroad project, uniting the cities of Goldsboro and Charlotte by rail. The next day, the first locomotive passed along the new route. When the iron horse arrived in Alamance County, locals referred to it as &quot;the eighth wonder of the world&quot;.

Not long after this historic opening, the railroad realized a pressing need for repair shops. With Alamance County&#x27;s position along the new line, it became the logical choice for the shops&#x27; location. After several debates concerning where the shops would be located, Gen. Benjamin Trollinger, a progressive Alamance County manufacturer, made an offer that settled the matter. Gen. Trollinger owned land just northwest of Graham, and he convinced several other prominent citizens owning adjacent lots to join him and sell their property to the railroad. 57 buildings were constructed between 1855 and 1859, including structures for engine and machine shops, carpentry, blacksmithing, houses for workers and railway officials, and company headquarters. For a brief period, railroad directors changed the name of official name of &quot;Company Shops&quot; to &quot;Vance&quot; (1863–1864), the village returned to the &quot;Company Shops&quot; moniker in July 1864. During the Civil War, Company Shops remained a small village without many public utilities/services like churches or schools. It was only until 1863 that company stockholders approved city street layouts and the sale of private property in the village. Though, properties used for commercial purposes still had to be leased by the company and couldn&#x27;t be bought. In 1866, the village was officially incorporated as &quot;Company Shops.&quot;

Through a series of leases and mergers, the railroad was leased to Richmond &amp; Danville Railroad (1871), working as part of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and in 1893, the North Carolina Railroad was folded into the Southern Railway system. Following the leasing of the railroad to Richmond &amp; Danville, many of the railroad jobs transferred to Richmond and Manchester. With the railroad shops no longer operated there, the citizens of Company Shops decided a new name was needed. In February 1887, a contest was held to decide a name, and one person submitted the name &quot;Burlington&quot; after seeing it on a passing train. An appointed committee for the town selected the name, and the name was officially changed through North Carolina State Legislature.

Around the turn of the century, Edwin M. Holt established small textile operations along the Haw River and Great Alamance Creek. In 1908, Edwin M. Holt built the first cotton mill in the South. From the establishment of this single factory, Alamance County grew to eventually operate 30 cotton mills and 10 to 15 yarn manufacturing plants employing 15,000 people. Eventually, the early textile venture of Edwin M. Holt became known all over the world as Burlington Industries, and is now headquartered in nearby Greensboro. Throughout this period, Burlington became a prosperous and vibrant little city filled with schools, churches, newspapers, telegraph and telephone lines, roads and a streetcar lineall in keeping with the latest &quot;modern progress&quot; of the times.

Though textiles continued to dominate the local economy well into the 1970s, the people of Burlington knew they could not survive with only one industry. The country&#x27;s involvement in World War II brought important local economic changes. In 1942, the federal government purchased and leased a site to Fairchild Aircraft Corporation for the construction of test aircraft. After two years of production, the site was leased to Firestone Tire Company for the Army&#x27;s tank rebuilding program. At the close of the war, the federal government chose not to leave, but to utilize the property for government contract business. This decision would bring Western Electric to town along with new employees from around the country. Their contracts ensured Burlington&#x27;s participation during the Cold War manufacturing and testing of emerging defense technologies. Four decades later (1991), however, Western Electric (then AT&amp;T Federal Systems Division) permanently closed.

During this century-and-a-half of economic change, Burlington grew, adapted and prospered. Originally the center of commerce for Company Shops, the downtown area still serves as the heart of today&#x27;s community with financial services, government services, an expanded library, small shops, eateries and a restored theater. Downtown has also returned to its status as a major employment center, becoming the home to Laboratory Corporation of America, one of the world&#x27;s largest biomedical testing firms and Burlington/Alamance County&#x27;s largest employer.

The Alamance Hotel, Allen House, Atlantic Bank and Trust Company Building, Beverly Hills Historic District, Downtown Burlington Historic District, East Davis Street Historic District, Efird Building, First Baptist Church, First Christian Church of Burlington, Polly Fogleman House, Holt-Frost House, Horner Houses, Lakeside Mills Historic District, McCray School, Menagerie Carousel, Moore-Holt-White House, South Broad-East Fifth Streets Historic District, Southern Railway Passenger Station, St. Athanasius Episcopal Church and Parish House and the Church of the Holy Comforter, Stagg House, Sunny Side, US Post Office, West Davis Street-Fountain Place Historic District, and Windsor Cotton Mills Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Education==
The local public school in Haw River is Haw River Elementary School, part of the Alamance-Burlington School System, which was created by a merger between the Alamance County School System and the Burlington City School System in 1996.

==History==
In 1745, Adam Trollinger established a homestead on the banks of the Haw River. From that beginning, the community of Haw River was developed. Trollinger was a native of the Rhine river valley in Germany and had lived in Pennsylvania before heading south to seek a new life. His settlement was very near the site of an earlier Sissipahaw Indian village. Trollinger chose the spot because it had an easy crossing while nearby the river moved with enough power to drive a mill wheel.

In 1748, Adam&#x27;s son, Jacob, built a grist mill, one of the first industries in the wilderness area. A village known as Trollinger&#x27;s Ford grew up around the mill.

Lord Cornwallis passed nearby during the last days of the Revolutionary War. His foraging soldiers raided Trollinger&#x27;s mill and confiscated the miller&#x27;s grain. When Jacob confronted the redcoats, they bound him to a tree with a bridle bit in his mouth. Upon his release, Trollinger sent two of his sons and a slave to help fight the British.

Benjamin Trollinger built the first part of the Granite Mill in 1844, marking the beginning of the textile industry in the village. It is the only antebellum mill building in Alamance County still in use. Since that time, the development of the town has been inextricably linked to events at the mill.

In 1849, the North Carolina Railroad was chartered and Benjamin Trollinger secured its passage through the mill town by building a railroad bridge over the river at his own expense. The town became known as Haw River Depot. Benjamin Trollinger also was instrumental in locating the railroad repair station at Company Shops (now Burlington) a few miles west.

As a result of financial difficulties brought on by the failure of Trollinger&#x27;s hotel in Haw River, Edwin Michael Holt, already one of the state&#x27;s most successful manufacturers, and his son, Thomas M. Holt, acquired the mill in 1858. In 1861, Thomas M. Holt bought his father&#x27;s interest in the property and moved to Haw River to oversee the running of the mill.

During the Civil War, much cloth was shipped to Raleigh for Confederate uniforms. As the war drew to a close, gold and other treasures were hidden near the railroad line in and around Haw River, and tales of buried treasure persist. 

In 1868, Thomas Holt&#x27;s brother-in-law, Adolphus &quot;Dolph&quot; Moore, became partner in the mill, and the operation was called Holt and Moore. George Swepson came to town, and barges began carrying raw cotton to his mill in Swepsonville and returning with spun products to be shipped by rail.

In 1876, Dolph Moore was found shot in George Swepson&#x27;s yard. When Moore died, George Swepson was charged with the crime. Though acquitted, he was forced to leave town. The mills became the Thomas M. Holt Manufacturing Company.

Haw River developed as a typical mill village in which the mill owned the homes of the millworkers and operated the company store. Many people moved from family farms to the community around the mill. Community life centered on sections within the town like Red Slide, Pine Knot, Sugar Hill, and Johnson City.

In 1881, Thomas M. Holt built a power dam across the river and a second mill across the street from Granite. Holt&#x27;s progressive management of the mill and his leadership of the North Carolina Railroad and the Grange led to a term as governor between 1891 and 1893. He died in 1896, leaving his son, Charles, to run the mill. The mill underwent several changes in management in the first quarter of the twentieth century.

The railroad bridge was the scene of derailments in 1911, 1936, and 1960. The last wreck damaged the depot which led to its demolition.

In 1928, the cotton factories in Haw River were acquired by Proximity Manufacturing, which later became Cone Mills Corporation. When corduroy became popular, the company decided to produce the cloth in Haw River. The plants south of Main Street were renamed Tabardrey and were equipped with new machinery to produce corduroy. The mills north of the highway became Granite Finishing for the finishing of the cloth. Corduroy production began on May 1, 1930, and Granite was shipping finished goods by June of the same year.

The little town thrived in the years following World War II. Businesses flourished on Main Street in the 1950s, and the Cone plants became the largest producers of corduroy in the world, employing over 1,000 people in 1981.

William Kerr Scott served as governor of North Carolina from 1949 to 1953, and from 1969 to 1973 his son, Robert Walker Scott, held the same office. Both men had Haw River addresses so that the only three governors from Alamance County are claimed by Haw River.

Haw River was officially incorporated on June 1, 1973. The Haw River municipal building was dedicated on Sunday, July 18, 1976, as part of the nation&#x27;s bicentennial. The Haw River Municipal Park was opened on August 7, 1981.

Haw River is the location of the untimely death of blood plasma pioneer Dr. Charles Drew, on April 1, 1950. He was driving a group of his colleagues to a medical conference in Alabama when he apparently dozed off at the wheel, resulting in a crash and the mortal wounds that were the cause of his death. An urban myth developed that he had been denied treatment and allowed to bleed to death, because of his being black, but eyewitnesses, including one of his fellow doctors who was at the hospital, have testified that nothing of the sort happened, as detailed in the &quot;Raleigh News and Observer&quot;.

The Charles T. Holt House and Kerr Scott Farm are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Saxapahaw ( ) is a census-designated place (CDP) and unincorporated area in Alamance County, North Carolina, United States. It is part of the Burlington, North Carolina Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,648 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The Former Saxapahaw Spinning Mill and James Monroe Thompson House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The name Saxapahaw is from the Catawban /sak&#x27;yápha:/, which is composed of /sak/ (&quot;hill&quot;) and /yápha:/ (&quot;step&quot;).

Saxapahaw, like most communities in Alamance County, was a mill town built around the community&#x27;s cotton mill and along the Haw River. The first mill was built in the community in 1844 by the Quaker settler John Newlin, but was later demolished to make way for a brick structure. The current mill building was owned and operated by Dixie Yarns until 1994, when a tornado damaged the structure and operations never resumed. Building remodeling was completed in 2006 and the facility, now known as Rivermill, houses apartments.

The Haw River Ballroom is a music venue set in the former Dye House of Saxapahaw&#x27;s historic cotton mill.

<doc id="127647" wikidata="Q2029804" url="?curid=127647" title="Lansing, North Carolina">
<text>Lansing is a resort town in Ashe County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 126 at the 2020 census.

Lansing is a popular destination among retirees and tourists from Florida, as well as those from the lower elevations of the Carolinas and Georgia.

== History ==
The town of Lansing was incorporated May 16, 1928. Lansing has one stop sign, a single three-way intersection at NC 194 and Big Horse Creek Road.

In the early 20th century, Lansing was a prosperous community, primarily because of the Norfolk and Western Railroad Company, whose daily mixed train, nicknamed the &quot;Virginia Creeper&quot;, stopped here. Todd, West Jefferson, White Oak, and other towns in North Carolina were also regular stopping places for the train. There were some productive iron mines around Lansing that used the railroad to move ore.

In the 1930s and 1940s, Lansing was home to one of two cheese factories in Ashe County. Lansing&#x27;s cheese plant offered local farmers a place to bring their goods instead of traveling to the county&#x27;s other cheese plant in West Jefferson.

Lansing High School was built in 1941 by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) using local granite stone.

<text>West Jefferson is a resort town in Ashe County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 1,279 at the 2020 census.

West Jefferson is a popular destination among tourists and retirees from Florida, as well as those from the lower elevations of the Carolinas and Georgia.

==History==
West Jefferson was incorporated in 1909. At one time, West Jefferson had the distinction of having the only cheese factory in the southeastern United States. For many decades, West Jefferson was served by the Norfolk and Western Railroad, better known as the &quot;Virginia Creeper.&quot; The railroad was the primary reason for the creation of West Jefferson, as the town became a major stop on the railway. With the decline of the railroad and the loss of textile factory jobs to foreign markets, West Jefferson&#x27;s economy is increasingly devoted to the tourism industry. The town&#x27;s location in the Appalachian Mountains has led to many tourists visiting the area each year, and many out-of-state tourists have begun to build cabins and housing developments around the town. Attractions include a walkable main street with food, breweries, local art, a cheese factory, a vintage theater, an annual festival, a caboose from a train, and a children&#x27;s playground.

<text>Banner Elk is a town in Avery County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 1,028 at the 2010 census. Banner Elk is home to Lees–McRae College.

== History==
The area surrounding the Elk River was inhabited by the Cherokee before western settlement, although no evidence of a permanent Cherokee settlement has ever been found. It is likely the area was used for hunting and fishing. The first permanent settlement was established by Martin L. Banner in 1848. Although the Banner family originally came from Wales, Martin Banner moved from Forsyth County in the Piedmont region of North Carolina. Eventually, the Banner family grew to 55 members, and the area where they lived became known as Banner&#x27;s Elk. This name was later shortened to Banner Elk when the town was incorporated in 1911.

The Banner Elk Hotel and Robert Chester and Elsie H. Lowe House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Banner Elk is located in North America&#x27;s humid continental climate zone due to its elevation, which gives it a climate more like that of Altoona, Pennsylvania, than Asheville, North Carolina, during the winter. During the summer the temperatures are much like a mountain lake town in New Hampshire. The town typically has cold, snowy winters and mild summers.

==Attractions==
During summertime there is hiking, whitewater rafting, fishing, and other activities. The largest lake in the area, Watauga Lake, is a favorite spot just 30 minutes away for boating, fishing and wake boarding. In the winter the main activities are skiing and snowboarding. There are two slopes in the area: Beech Mountain and Sugar Mountain. There was formerly a third, but in the winter of 2008–2009, Hawks&#x27; Nest became an all-tubing park, the largest in the Eastern United States.

There are several restaurants in Banner Elk in addition to a post office, bank, and many lodging choices. The town has hosted the Woolly Worm festival over the third weekend of October since 1978.

In the 1970s, Beech Mountain was home to a theme park based on &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, called The Land of Oz, but it closed after 10 years. The attraction was never fully removed, and there have been various attempts to revive it.

==Education==

Lees–McRae College is a private four-year college in Banner Elk. Banner Elk has a K-5th school, run by the Avery County School system.

==History==
In 1882, the East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad (&quot;Tweetsie&quot;) linked Cranberry and Johnson City, Tennessee with a stop at Elk Park; three years later, Elk Park was incorporated. In 1911, Avery County was established; originally Elk Park was to serve as the county seat, but was changed after North Carolina Lieutenant Governor William C. Newland made a deal that the new county seat would be named after him for his aid in passage of the bill. However, Elk Park served as a temporary county seat while the new incorporated town of Newland was being constructed. In 1950, the East Tennessee and Western North Carolina decommissioned the railroad at Elk Park, ending rail service in Avery County, though it has survived as a town, unlike neighboring Cranberry.

Elk Park School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

<text>Newland is a town in and the county seat of Avery County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 715 at the 2020 census. By elevation, Newland is the highest county seat located east of the Mississippi River.

==History==
Before its founding, the area was known as &quot;Old Fields of Toe&quot;. It was an early muster ground in the campaign against Indians and before the Battle of Kings Mountain. On November 9, 1783, the land was granted to Colonel Waightstill Avery.

The name comes from the legend of Estatoe, pronounced &#x27;S - ta - toe&#x27;, about an Indian chief&#x27;s daughter who fell in love with a warrior of a rival tribe. Because their love could never be accepted by either&#x27;s families, they jumped from a precipice into the depths of a nearby river. In an alternative version, their love caused a bloody war between the tribes and Estatoe crafted a peace pipe with two stems in which both chiefs could smoke at once. The two rival chiefs assembled their respective followers on the bank of the river, and smoked till peace was concluded and Estatoe married her lover.

In 1899, the Linville River Railway (LRR) began rail service in the area, with a flag stop at &quot;Old Fields&quot;. In 1911, upon the establishment of Avery County, Old Fields of Toe was designated as the site for the county seat and was renamed Newland, after the North Carolina Lieutenant Governor William C. Newland. In 1912, the Newland Post Office was established; while in 1913, the Avery County Courthouse and Avery County Jail opened (both in the National Register of Historic Places). In that same year, Newland was incorporated as a town. In 1914, the East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad (ET&amp;WNC), successor of the LRR, opened the Newland Depot, which was equipped with telephone and telegraph services; burned down in 1921, but was soon rebuilt and continued operations till 1940.

<text>Bath is a town in Beaufort County, North Carolina, United States. Located on the Pamlico River, it developed a trade in naval stores, furs, and tobacco. The population was 245 at the 2020 census. North Carolina’s first town and port of entry, it was chartered on March 8, 1705.

Historically, Bath is often counted as North Carolina&#x27;s first capital, as it was nominally so designated in 1712, when the Province of North Carolina was separated from the Province of Carolina and granted its own governor, though no permanent government institutions were located there. The capital was officially moved to Edenton in 1722, but the meetings of the General Assembly would still periodically occur in Bath in the 18th century. Bath was the site of Cary&#x27;s Rebellion in 1711, and later served as one of many bases for notorious pirate Blackbeard. Bath waned in population, as its importance as both a port and government center were surpassed by the nearby city of New Bern. Bath&#x27;s population fluctuated through the 20th and 21st centuries, but it has never exceeded 400 residents.

== History ==
European settlement near the Pamlico River in the 1690s led to the founding of Bath. The first settlers were mostly English farmers and French Huguenots (Protestants who went as refugees to England and Virginia); among those inhabitants was John Lawson, naturalist, explorer, and town father. The town was named after Bath, England by the English settlers who founded the town.

In 1708, Bath consisted of 12 houses and about 50 people. Early Bath was disturbed by political rivalries, epidemics, Indian wars (the Tuscarora War), and piracy. Residents suffered yellow fever, along with a severe drought in 1711. A war between the early settlers and the powerful Tuscarora Indians arose following the fever and drought, as the American Indians tried to push out the peoples encroaching on their territory. They attacked Bath, as well as plantations along the rivers, but by 1715 were defeated by a coalition of colonial settlers from the Carolinas and a much larger group of American Indians allied against them.

From 1705 until 1722, Bath was the first nominal capital of North Carolina; Edenton was designated next. The colony had no permanent institutions of government until their establishment of the new capital New Bern in 1743.

John Lawson was known as the town father. He documented the beauty and unique qualities of the town, laid out the town plan and helped secure its charter in 1705. On March 8, 1705, the tract of land was incorporated as the town of Bath by the General Assembly at a meeting at Capt. John Heckenfield&#x27;s home in Albemarle. Lawson had laid out the town into 71 lots measuring and (Poles) (about a tenth of an acre). The lots were located on the waterfront; as was typical, this was the main transportation route. The bordering road is now known as Main Street. Early merchants had easy access by the water.

Blackbeard the pirate was notorious in the southern colonies. He was a prominent figure by the time he settled briefly in Bath. He had conducted piracy off the East Coast and in the West Indies. He settled in Bath in 1718, gaining a royal pardon (these were offered by the Crown through colonial officials in an attempt to reduce piracy). He soon started piracy again, and was captured and executed later that year by Virginia forces. Bath was also the site of Cary&#x27;s Rebellion in 1711.

During the Great Awakening in America, the English Methodist evangelist, George Whitefield, visited the town four times between 1747 and 1762 to preach the gospel. On his fourth visit, the Anglican church reportedly refused to allow him to preach. T. Jensen Lacy in his book, &quot;Amazing North Carolina,&quot; writes: 
Whitfield finally gave up on converting Bath ... Just like the disciples of old, he drove his wagon to the outskirts of town, removed his shoes, shook the dirt from them, and put a curse on the town. He told onlookers that the Bible said people who couldn&#x27;t get sinners to reform were to do just what he had done, and by shaking the dust of Bath from his shoes, the town would be cursed for its hardness of heart against the Word. Whitfield declared, &quot;I say to the village of Bath, village you shall remain, now and forever, forgotten by men and nations until such time as it pleases God to turn the light of His countenance again upon you.&quot;

Development moved past Bath and the town lies almost entirely within the same boundaries laid out by its primary founder, John Lawson. The major business cities of North Carolina have developed in the Piedmont area, stimulated by construction of railroads and nineteenth-century textile mills. Bath has remained a sleepy little village on the North Carolina coast. By contrast, population has continued to increase in the county, reaching nearly 50,000 in 2010. But the area is being developed for retirement and second homes, making it strong in a service economy, but with mostly low-paying jobs.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 60.99%, is water.

As of the census of 2000, there were 275 people, 122 households, and 86 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 150 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 95.64% White, 2.91% African American, 1.09% Native American, and 0.36% from other races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.82% of the population.

There were 122 households, out of which 21.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 62.3% were married couples living together, 5.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.5% were non-families. 27.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 18.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.25 and the average family size was 2.73.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 19.6% under the age of 18, 3.3% from 18 to 24, 21.1% from 25 to 44, 32.0% from 45 to 64, and 24.0% who were 65 years of age or older.

About 8.0% of families and 8.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.8% of those under the age of eighteen and 11.3% of those 65 or over.

==Economy==

Bath has changed little since the colonial and early federal period. People interested in heritage tourism have made it a destination for both locals of eastern North Carolina and visitors from other regions. Tourists swell the population during the summer. Favorite water-based recreation includes wakeboarding, water skiing, and boat rides or jet ski rides through the creek down to the river.

Other attractions include the Historic Bath State Historic Site, which gives tours of the old town of Bath; St. Thomas Church, the oldest standing Episcopal Church in North Carolina; historical houses; and a visitors center. A ferry route provides service from the northern shore of the Pamlico River to the southern shore of the river. Visitors to Goose Creek State Park can see and learn about the beautiful marshes and swamps along the Pamlico River and Goose Creek; they can rent canoes as well as fish from the shores of the river.

In addition to the Bath Historic District and St. Thomas Church, the Bath School, Bonner House, and Palmer-Marsh House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==In popular culture==
* Edna Ferber wrote &quot;Show Boat,&quot; featuring a Bath setting. She was inspired by her own visit to the showboat &quot;James Adams Floating Theatre&quot; when it visited Bath Creek during the spring of 1925. Her novel featured an interracial relationship and issues related to a mixed-race person during the period of racial segregation in the South. The novel was adapted as a film and as a musical produced on Broadway.

<doc id="127657" wikidata="Q160149" url="?curid=127657" title="Mark Rothko">
<text>Mark Rothko ( ; Markus Yakovlevich Rothkowitz until 1940; September 25, 1903February 25, 1970) was a Latvian American abstract painter. He is best known for his color field paintings that depicted irregular and painterly rectangular regions of color, which he produced from 1949 to 1970. Although Rothko did not personally subscribe to any one school, he is associated with the American abstract expressionism movement of modern art.

Born in Daugavpils, Latvia, then part of the Russian Empire, Rothko and his family emigrated to the United States, arriving at Ellis Island in late 1913 and originally settling in Portland, Oregon. He moved to New York City in 1923 where his youthful period of artistic production dealt primarily with urban scenery. In response to World War II, Rothko&#x27;s art entered a transitional phase during the 1940s, where he experimented with mythological themes and Surrealism to express tragedy. Toward the end of the decade, Rothko painted canvases with regions of pure color which he further abstracted into rectangular color forms, the idiom he would use for the rest of his life.

In his later career, Rothko executed several canvases for three different mural projects. The Seagram murals were to have decorated the Four Seasons Restaurant in the Seagram Building, but Rothko eventually grew disgusted with the idea that his paintings would be decorative objects for wealthy diners and refunded the lucrative commission, donating the paintings to museums including the Tate Gallery. The Harvard Mural series was donated to a dining room in Harvard&#x27;s Holyoke Center (now Smith Campus Center); their colors faded badly over time due to Rothko&#x27;s use of the pigment lithol red together with regular sunlight exposure. The Harvard series has since been restored using a special lighting technique. Rothko contributed 14 canvases to a permanent installation at the Rothko Chapel, a non-denominational chapel in Houston, Texas.

Although Rothko lived modestly for much of his life, the resale value of his paintings grew tremendously in the decades following his suicide in 1970. His painting &quot;No. 6 (Violet, Green and Red)&quot; sold in 2014 for $186 million.

== Childhood ==
Rothko was born in 1903 in Dvinsk (now Daugavpils, Latvia), a &quot;shtetl&quot; (Jewish village) within the Pale of Settlement in the Russian Empire. His father, Jacob (Yakov) Rothkowitz, was a pharmacist and intellectual who initially provided his children with a secular and political, rather than religious, upbringing. According to Rothko, his Marxist father was &quot;violently anti-religious&quot;. In an environment where Jews were often blamed for many of the evils that befell Russia, Rothko&#x27;s early childhood was plagued by fear.

Despite Jacob Rothkowitz&#x27;s modest income, the family was highly educated (&quot;We were a reading family&quot;, Rothko&#x27;s sister recalled), and Rothko spoke Lithuanian Yiddish (Litvish), Hebrew and Russian. Following his father&#x27;s return to the Orthodox Judaism of his own youth, Rothko, the youngest of four siblings, was sent to the cheder at age five, where he studied the Talmud, although his elder siblings had been educated in the public school system.

==Migration from Russian Empire to the U.S.==
Fearing that his elder sons were about to be drafted into the Imperial Russian Army, Jacob Rothkowitz emigrated from Russian Empire to the United States. Mark, then known as Markus, remained in Russian Empire with his mother and elder sister Sonia. They arrived as immigrants, at Ellis Island, in late 1913. From there, they crossed the country, to join Jacob and the elder brothers, in Portland, Oregon. Jacob&#x27;s death, a few months later, of colon cancer, left the family without financial support. Sonia operated a cash register, while Markus worked in one of his uncle&#x27;s warehouses, selling newspapers to employees. His father&#x27;s death also led Rothko to sever his ties with religion. After he had mourned his father&#x27;s death for almost a year at a local synagogue, he vowed never to set foot in one again.

Rothko started school in the United States in 1913, quickly accelerating from third to fifth grade. In June 1921, he completed the secondary level, with honors, at Lincoln High School in Portland, Oregon, at age 17.
He learned his fourth language, English, and became an active member of the Jewish community center, where he proved adept at political discussions. Like his father, Rothko was passionate about issues such as workers&#x27; rights and contraception. At the time, Portland was a center of revolutionary activity in the U.S. and the region where the revolutionary syndicalist union Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) was active.

Having grown up around radical workers&#x27; meetings, Rothko attended meetings of the IWW, including such speakers as the radical socialist Bill Haywood and the anarchist Emma Goldman, where he developed strong oratorical skills he later used in defense of Surrealism. With the onset of the Russian Revolution, Rothko organized debates about it. Despite the repressive political atmosphere, he wished to become a labor union organizer.

Rothko received a scholarship to Yale. At the end of his first year in 1922, the scholarship was not renewed, and he worked as a waiter and delivery boy to support his studies. Rothko was more an autodidact than a diligent pupil: One of his fellow students remembers that he hardly seemed to study, but that he was a voracious reader.

Rothko and a friend, Aaron Director, started a satirical magazine, &quot;The Yale Saturday Evening Pest&quot;, that lampooned the school&#x27;s stuffy, bourgeois tone. Finding Yale to be elitist, and racist, at the end of his sophomore year, Rothko dropped out, never returning until he was awarded an honorary degree 46 years later.

==Early career==
In the autumn of 1923, Rothko found work in New York&#x27;s garment district. While visiting a friend at the Art Students League of New York, he saw students sketching a model. According to Rothko, this was the beginning of his life as an artist. He later enrolled in the Parsons The New School for Design, where one of his instructors was Arshile Gorky. Rothko characterized Gorky&#x27;s leadership of the class as &quot;overcharged with supervision.&quot; That same autumn, he took courses at the Art Students League taught by Cubist artist Max Weber, who had been a part of the French avant-garde movement. To his students eager to know about Modernism, Weber was seen as &quot;a living repository of modern art history&quot;. Under Weber&#x27;s tutelage, Rothko began to view art as a vehicle for emotional and religious expression. Rothko&#x27;s paintings from this era reveal the influence of his instructor. Years later, when Weber attended a show of his former student&#x27;s work and expressed his admiration, Rothko was immensely pleased.

===Rothko&#x27;s circle===
Rothko&#x27;s move to New York landed him in a fertile artistic atmosphere. Modernist painters regularly exhibited in New York galleries, and the city&#x27;s museums were an invaluable resource for a budding artist&#x27;s knowledge and skills. Among the important early influences on him were the works of the German Expressionists, the surrealist art of Paul Klee, and the paintings of Georges Rouault.

In 1928, with a group of other young artists, Rothko exhibited works at the Opportunity Gallery. His paintings, including dark, moody, expressionist interiors and urban scenes, were generally well accepted among critics and peers. To supplement his income, in 1929 Rothko began instructing schoolchildren in drawing, painting, and clay sculpture at the Center Academy of the Brooklyn Jewish Center, where he remained active for over twenty years.

During the early 1930s, Rothko met Adolph Gottlieb, who, along with Barnett Newman, Joseph Solman, Louis Schanker, and John Graham, was part of a group of young artists surrounding the painter Milton Avery. According to Elaine de Kooning, it was Avery who &quot;gave Rothko the idea that [the life of a professional artist] was a possibility.&quot;Avery&#x27;s abstract nature paintings, utilizing a rich knowledge of form and color, had a tremendous influence on him. Soon, Rothko&#x27;s paintings took on the subject matter and color similar to Avery&#x27;s, as seen in &quot;Bathers, or Beach Scene&quot; of 1933–1934.

Rothko, Gottlieb, Newman, Solman, Graham, and their mentor, Avery, spent considerable time together, vacationing at Lake George, New York, and Gloucester, Massachusetts. In the daytime, they painted, then discussed art in the evenings. During a 1932 visit to Lake George, Rothko met Edith Sachar, a jewelry designer, whom he married later that year. The following summer, his first one-person show was held at the Portland Art Museum, consisting mostly of drawings and aquarelles. For this exhibition, Rothko took the very unusual step of displaying works done by his pre-adolescent students from the Center Academy, alongside his own. His family was unable to understand Rothko&#x27;s decision to be an artist, especially considering the dire economic situation of the Depression. Having suffered serious financial setbacks, the Rothkowitzes were mystified by Rothko&#x27;s seeming indifference to financial necessity. They felt he was doing his mother a disservice by not finding a more lucrative and realistic career.

===First solo show in New York===
Returning to New York, Rothko had his first East Coast one-person show at the Contemporary Arts Gallery. He showed fifteen oil paintings, mostly portraits, along with some aquarelles and drawings. Among these works, the oil paintings especially captured the art critics&#x27; eyes. Rothko&#x27;s use of rich fields of colors moved beyond Avery&#x27;s influence. In late 1935, Rothko joined with Ilya Bolotowsky, Ben-Zion, Adolph Gottlieb, Louis Harris, Ralph Rosenborg, Louis Schanker and Joseph Solman to form &quot;The Ten&quot;. According to a gallery show catalog, the mission of the group was &quot;to protest against the reputed equivalence of American painting and literal painting.&quot;

Rothko was earning a growing reputation among his peers, particularly among the group that formed the Artists&#x27; Union. The Artists&#x27; Union, including Gottlieb and Solman, hoped to create a municipal art gallery, to show self-organized group exhibitions. In 1936, the group exhibited at the Galerie Bonaparte in France, which resulted in some positive critical attention. One reviewer remarked that Rothko&#x27;s paintings &quot;display authentic coloristic values.&quot; Later, in 1938, a show was held at the Mercury Gallery in New York, intended as a protest against the Whitney Museum of American Art, which the group regarded as having a provincial, regionalist agenda. Also during this period, Rothko, like Avery, Gorky, Pollock, de Kooning, and many others, found employment with the Works Progress Administration.

===Development of style===
Rothko&#x27;s work has been described in eras. His early period (1924–1939) saw representational art inflected by impressionism, usually depicting urban scenes. In 1936, Rothko began writing a book, never completed, about similarities between the art of children and the work of modern painters. According to Rothko, the work of modernists, influenced by primitive art, could be compared to that of children in that &quot;child art transforms itself into primitivism, which is only the child producing a mimicry of himself.&quot; In this manuscript, he observed: &quot;Tradition of starting with drawing in academic notion. We may start with color.&quot; Rothko was using fields of color in his aquarelles and city scenes. His style was already evolving in the direction of his renowned later works. In the 1930s, Rothko and Gottlieb together worked through intellectual perceptions and opinions they had about contemporary art. By the 1940s, both artists were delving into mythology for themes and forms, tapping into what could be considered universal consciousness.

This period extended into his middle, &quot;transitional&quot; years (1940–1950), continuing incorporation of mythical and &quot;biomorphic&quot; abstraction, and &quot;multiforms&quot;, the latter being canvases with large regions of color. Rothko&#x27;s transitional decade was influenced by World War II, which prompted him to seek novel expression of tragedy in art. During this time Rothko was influenced by ancient Greek tragedians such as Aeschylus and his reading of Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;.

In Rothko&#x27;s mature or &quot;classic&quot; period (1951–1970), he consistently painted rectangular regions of color, intended as &quot;dramas&quot; to elicit an emotional response from the viewer.

==Maturity==
Rothko separated temporarily from his wife Edith in mid-1937. They reconciled several months later, but their relationship remained tense and they would divorce in 1944. On February 21, 1938, Rothko finally became a citizen of the United States. Concerned about antisemitism in America and Europe, Rothko abbreviated his name from &quot;Markus Rothkowitz&quot; to &quot;Mark Rothko&quot;. The name &quot;Roth&quot;, a common abbreviation, was still identifiably Jewish, so he settled upon &quot;Rothko.&quot;

===Inspiration from mythology===
Fearing that modern American painting had reached a conceptual dead end, Rothko was intent on exploring subjects other than urban and nature scenes. He sought subjects that would complement his growing interest in form, space, and color. The world crisis of war gave this search a sense of immediacy. He insisted that the new subject matter have a social impact, yet be able to transcend the confines of current political symbols and values. In his essay &quot;The Romantics Were Prompted,&quot; published in 1948, Rothko argued that the &quot;archaic artist ... found it necessary to create a group of intermediaries, monsters, hybrids, gods and demigods,&quot; in much the same way that modern man found intermediaries in Fascism and the Communist Party. For Rothko, &quot;without monsters and gods, art cannot enact a drama&quot;.

Rothko&#x27;s use of mythology as a commentary on current history was not novel. Rothko, Gottlieb, and Newman read and discussed the works of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. In particular, they took interest in psychoanalytical theories concerning dreams, and archetypes of a collective unconscious. They understood mythological symbols as images, operating in a space of human consciousness, which transcends specific history and culture. Rothko later said that his artistic approach was &quot;reformed&quot; by his study of the &quot;dramatic themes of myth&quot;. He allegedly stopped painting altogether in 1940, to immerse himself in reading Sir James Frazer&#x27;s study of mythology &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, and Freud&#x27;s &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;.

===Nietzsche&#x27;s influence===
Rothko&#x27;s new vision attempted to address modern man&#x27;s spiritual and creative mythological requirements. The most crucial philosophical influence on Rothko in this period was Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;. Nietzsche claimed that Greek tragedy served to redeem man from the terrors of mortal life. The exploration of novel topics in modern art ceased to be Rothko&#x27;s goal. From this time on, his art had the goal of relieving modern man&#x27;s spiritual emptiness. He believed that this emptiness resulted partly from lack of mythology, which, according to Nietzsche, &quot;The images of the myth have to be the unnoticed omnipresent demonic guardians, under whose care the young soul grows to maturity and whose signs help the man to interpret his life and struggles.&quot; Rothko believed his art could free unconscious energies, previously bound by mythological images, symbols, and rituals. He considered himself a &quot;mythmaker&quot;, and proclaimed that &quot;the exhilarated tragic experience is for me the only source of art&quot;.

Many of his paintings in this period contrast barbaric scenes of violence with civilized passivity, using imagery drawn primarily from Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Oresteia&quot; trilogy. A list of Rothko&#x27;s paintings from this period illustrates his use of myth: &quot;Antigone&quot;, &quot;Oedipus&quot;, &quot;The Sacrifice of Iphigenia&quot;, &quot;Leda&quot;, &quot;The Furies&quot;, &quot;Altar of Orpheus&quot;. Rothko evokes Judeo-Christian imagery in &quot;Gethsemane&quot;, &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, and &quot;Rites of Lilith&quot;. He also invokes Egyptian (&quot;Room in Karnak&quot;) and Syrian (&quot;The Syrian Bull&quot;) myths. Soon after World War II, Rothko believed his titles limited the larger, transcendent aims of his paintings. To allow maximum interpretation by the viewer, he stopped naming and framing his paintings, referring to them only by numbers.

===&quot;Mythomorphic&quot; abstractionism===
At the root of Rothko and Gottlieb&#x27;s presentation of archaic forms and symbols, illuminating modern existence had been the influence of Surrealism, Cubism, and abstract art. In 1936, Rothko attended two exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, &quot;Cubism and Abstract Art&quot;, and &quot;Fantastic Art, Dada, and Surrealism&quot;.

In 1942, following the success of shows by Ernst, Miró, Wolfgang Paalen, Tanguy, and Salvador Dalí, artists who had immigrated to the United States because of the war, Surrealism took New York by storm. Rothko and his peers, Gottlieb and Newman, met and discussed the art and ideas of these European pioneers, as well as those of Mondrian.

New paintings were unveiled at a 1942 show at Macy&#x27;s department store in New York City. In response to a negative review by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Rothko and Gottlieb issued a manifesto, written mainly by Rothko. Addressing the &quot;Times&quot; critic&#x27;s self-professed &quot;befuddlement&quot; over the new work, they stated &quot;We favor the simple expression of the complex thought. We are for the large shape because it has the impact of the unequivocal. We wish to reassert the picture plane. We are for flat forms because they destroy illusion and reveal truth.&quot; On a more strident note, they criticized those who wanted to live surrounded by less challenging art, noting that their work necessarily &quot;must insult anyone who is spiritually attuned to interior decoration&quot;.

Rothko viewed myth as a replenishing resource for an era of spiritual void. This belief had begun decades earlier, through his reading of Carl Jung, T. S. Eliot, James Joyce and Thomas Mann, among other authors.

===Break with Surrealism===
On June 13, 1943, Rothko and Sachar separated again. Rothko suffered depression following their divorce. Thinking that a change of scenery might help, Rothko returned to Portland. From there, he traveled to Berkeley, where he met artist Clyfford Still, and the two began a close friendship. Still&#x27;s deeply abstract paintings would be of considerable influence on Rothko&#x27;s later works. In the autumn of 1943, Rothko returned to New York. He met with noted collector and art dealer Peggy Guggenheim, but she was initially reluctant to take on his artworks. Rothko&#x27;s one-person show at Guggenheim&#x27;s the Art of This Century gallery, in late 1945, resulted in few sales, with prices ranging from $150 to $750. The exhibit also attracted less-than-favorable reviews from critics. During this period, Rothko had been stimulated by Still&#x27;s abstract landscapes of color, and his style shifted away from surrealism. Rothko&#x27;s experiments in interpreting the unconscious symbolism of everyday forms had run their course. His future lay with abstraction:

Rothko&#x27;s masterpiece &quot;Slow Swirl at the Edge of the Sea&quot; (1945) illustrates his newfound propensity towards abstraction. It has been interpreted as a meditation on Rothko&#x27;s courtship of his second wife, Mary Alice &quot;Mell&quot; Beistle, whom he met in 1944 and married in early 1945. Other readings have noted echoes of Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot;, which Rothko saw at an &quot;Italian Masters&quot; loan exhibition, at the Museum of Modern Art, in 1940. The painting presents, in subtle grays and browns, two human-like forms embraced in a swirling, floating atmosphere of shapes and colors. The rigid rectangular background foreshadows Rothko&#x27;s later experiments in pure color. The painting was completed, not coincidentally, in the year the Second World War ended.

Although initially hesitant to purchase his works, Guggenheim did acquire several works following Rothko&#x27;s exhibition at the Art of This Century gallery, including &quot;Sacrifice&quot; (1946), which she purchased immediately following its completion. Like other works of this period, it depicted biomorphic shapes and abstract imagery in subtle tones. Guggenheim later showed this work in her European galleries, making it among the first of Rothko&#x27;s paintings to be exhibited outside the United States.

Despite the abandonment of his &quot;Mythomorphic Abstractionism&quot;, Rothko would still be recognized by the public primarily for his surrealist works, for the remainder of the 1940s. The Whitney Museum included them in their annual exhibit of contemporary art from 1943 to 1950. &quot;Baptismal Scene&quot; (1945), included in the shows at the Whitney, was acquired by the museum in 1946; this was the first work of Rothko&#x27;s to enter a museum collection, marking a key career milestone. &quot;Baptismal Scene&quot; depicts an abstracted baptism in watercolors against a dusky grayish brown background, with an identifiable baptismal fountain at the top of the painting.

===&quot;Multiforms&quot;===
In 1946, Rothko created what art critics have since termed his transitional &quot;multiform&quot; paintings, although Rothko never used the term himself. Several of them, including &quot;No. 18&quot; and &quot;Untitled&quot; (both 1948), are less transitional than fully realized. Rothko himself described these paintings as possessing a more organic structure, and as self-contained units of human expression. For him, these blurred blocks of various colors, devoid of landscape or the human figure, let alone myth and symbol, possessed their own life force. They contained a &quot;breath of life&quot; he found lacking in the most figurative painting of the era. They were filled with possibility, whereas his experimentation with mythological symbolism had become a tired formula. The &quot;multiforms&quot; brought Rothko to a realization of his signature style of rectangular regions of color, which he continued to produce for the rest of his life.

In the middle of this crucial period of transition, Rothko had been impressed by Clyfford Still&#x27;s abstract fields of color, which were influenced in part by the landscapes of Still&#x27;s native North Dakota. In 1947, during a summer semester teaching at the California School of Fine Art, Rothko and Still flirted with the idea of founding their own curriculum. In 1948, Rothko, Robert Motherwell, William Baziotes, Barnett Newman, and David Hare founded the Subjects of the Artist School at 35 East 8th Street. Well-attended lectures there were open to the public, with speakers such as Jean Arp, John Cage, and Ad Reinhardt, but the school failed financially and closed in the spring of 1949.

Although the group separated later in the same year, the school was the center of a flurry of activity in contemporary art. In addition to his teaching experience, Rothko began to contribute articles to two new art publications, &quot;Tiger&#x27;s Eye&quot; and &quot;Possibilities&quot;. Using the forums as an opportunity to assess the current art scene, Rothko also discussed in detail his own work and philosophy of art. These articles reflect the elimination of figurative elements from his painting, and a specific interest in the new contingency debate launched by Wolfgang Paalen&#x27;s &quot;Form and Sense&quot; publication of 1945.

Rothko described his new method as &quot;unknown adventures in an unknown space&quot;, free from &quot;direct association with any particular, and the passion of organism&quot;. Breslin described this change of attitude as &quot;both self and painting are now fields of possibilities – an effect conveyed ... by the creation of protean, indeterminate shapes whose multiplicity is let be.&quot;

In 1947, he had a first solo exhibition at the Betty Parsons Gallery (March 3 to 22). In 1949, Rothko became fascinated by Henri Matisse&#x27;s &quot;Red Studio&quot;, acquired by the Museum of Modern Art that year. He later credited it as another key source of inspiration for his later abstract paintings.

==Late period==
The discovery of his definitive form came at a period of great distress to the artist, as his mother Kate had died in October 1948. As the &quot;multiforms&quot; developed into what was to become his signature style, by early 1949 Rothko exhibited these new works at the Betty Parsons Gallery. For critic Harold Rosenberg, the paintings were nothing short of a revelation. After painting his first &quot;multiform&quot;, Rothko had secluded himself in his home in East Hampton on Long Island. He invited only a select few, including Rosenberg, to view the new paintings.

Rothko happened upon the use of symmetrical rectangular blocks of two to three opposing or contrasting, yet complementary, colors, in which, for example, &quot;the rectangles sometimes seem barely to coalesce out of the ground, concentrations of its substance. The green bar in &quot;Magenta, Black, Green on Orange&quot;, on the other hand, appears to vibrate against the orange around it, creating an optical flicker.&quot;

For the next seven years, Rothko painted in oil only for large canvases with vertical formats. Very large-scale designs were used in order to overwhelm the viewer, or, in Rothko&#x27;s words, to make the viewer feel &quot;enveloped within&quot; the painting. For some critics, the large size was an attempt to make up for a lack of substance. In retaliation, Rothko stated:

 Rothko even went so far as to recommend that viewers position themselves as little as eighteen inches away from the canvas so that they might experience a sense of intimacy, as well as awe, a transcendence of the individual, and a sense of the unknown. As Rothko achieved success, he became increasingly protective of his works, turning down several potentially important sales and exhibition opportunities:

To some critics and viewers, Rothko&#x27;s aims exceeded his methods. Many of the abstract expressionists discussed their art as aiming toward a spiritual experience, or at least an experience that exceeded the boundaries of the purely aesthetic. In later years, Rothko emphasized more emphatically the spiritual aspect of his artwork, a sentiment that would culminate in the construction of the Rothko Chapel.

Many of his early signature paintings are composed of bright, vibrant colors, particularly reds and yellows, expressing energy and ecstasy. By the mid-1950s, however, Rothko began to employ dark blues and greens, which many critics suggested was representative of growing darkness within Rothko&#x27;s personal life.

===Technique===
With an absence of figurative representation, what drama there is to be found in a late Rothko is in the contrast of colors, radiating against one another. His paintings can then be likened to a sort of fugue-like arrangement, with each variation counterpoised against one another, yet all existing within one architectonic structure.

To achieve this effect, Rothko applied a thin layer of a binder mixed with pigment directly onto uncoated and untreated canvas and painted significantly thinned oils directly onto this layer, creating a dense mixture of overlapping colors and shapes. One of his objectives was to make the various layers of the painting dry quickly, without mixing of colors, so that he could soon create new layers on top of the earlier ones. His brushstrokes were fast and light, a method he would continue to use until his death. His increasing adeptness at this method is apparent in the paintings completed for the chapel.

Rothko used several original techniques that he tried to keep secret even from his assistants. Electron microscopy and ultraviolet analysis conducted by the MOLAB showed that he employed natural substances such as egg and glue, as well as artificial materials including acrylic resins, phenol formaldehyde, modified alkyd, and others.

In 1968 Rothko, in declining health, began painting most of his large works in acrylic paint instead of oils.

===European travels and increasing fame===
Rothko and his wife visited Europe for five months in early 1950. The last time he had been in Europe was during his childhood in Latvia, at that time part of Russia. Yet he did not return to his homeland, preferring to visit the important painting collections in the major museums of England, France, and Italy. The frescoes of Fra Angelico in the monastery of San Marco, Florence, most impressed him. Fra Angelico&#x27;s spirituality and concentration on light appealed to Rothko&#x27;s sensibilities, as did the economic adversities the artist faced, which Rothko saw as similar to his own.

Rothko had one-man shows at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1950 and 1951 and at other galleries across the world, including in Japan, São Paulo, and Amsterdam. The 1952 &quot;Fifteen Americans&quot; show curated by Dorothy Canning Miller at the Museum of Modern Art formally heralded the abstract artists and included works by Jackson Pollock and William Baziotes. It also created a dispute between Rothko and Barnett Newman, after Newman accused Rothko of having attempted to exclude him from the show. Growing success as a group was leading to infighting and claims of supremacy and leadership. When &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine named a Rothko painting in 1955 as a good investment, Newman and Clyfford Still branded him a sell-out with bourgeois aspirations. Still wrote to Rothko to ask that the paintings he had given him over the years be returned. Rothko was deeply depressed by his former friends&#x27; jealousy.

During the 1950 Europe trip, Rothko&#x27;s wife, Mell, became pregnant. On December 30, when they were back in New York, she gave birth to a daughter, Kathy Lynn, called &quot;Kate&quot; in honor of Rothko&#x27;s mother, Kate Goldin.

===Reactions to his own success===
Shortly thereafter, due to the &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine plug and further purchases by clients, Rothko&#x27;s financial situation began to improve. In addition to sales of paintings, he also had money from his teaching position at Brooklyn College. In 1954, he exhibited in a solo show at the Art Institute of Chicago, where he met art dealer Sidney Janis, who represented Pollock and Franz Kline. Their relationship proved mutually beneficial.

Despite his fame, Rothko felt a growing personal seclusion and a sense of being misunderstood as an artist. He feared that people purchased his paintings simply out of fashion and that collectors, critics, and audiences were not grasping his work&#x27;s true purpose. He wanted his paintings to move beyond abstraction, as well as beyond classical art. For Rothko, the paintings were objects that possessed their own form and potential and must be encountered as such. Sensing the futility of words in describing this decidedly nonverbal aspect of his work, Rothko abandoned all attempts at responding to those who inquired after its meaning and purpose, saying finally that silence is &quot;so accurate&quot;: My paintings&#x27; surfaces are expansive and push outward in all directions, or their surfaces contract and rush inward in all directions. Between these two poles, you can find everything I want to say.

Rothko began to insist that he was not an abstractionist and that such a description was as inaccurate as labeling him a great colorist. His interest was:

For Rothko, color was &quot;merely an instrument&quot;, and the signature paintings were just a simpler, purer form of expressing the same basic human emotions as his surrealistic mythological paintings. Rothko&#x27;s comment on viewers breaking down in tears before his paintings may have convinced the de Menils to construct the Rothko Chapel. As he grew older, hingeing around the late 1950s, the spiritual expression he meant to portray on canvas grew increasingly dark, and his bright reds, yellows, and oranges were subtly transformed into dark blues, greens, grays, and blacks.

Rothko&#x27;s friend, the art critic Dore Ashton, points to the artist&#x27;s acquaintance with poet Stanley Kunitz as a significant bond in this period (&quot;conversations between painter and poet fed into Rothko&#x27;s enterprise&quot;). Kunitz saw Rothko as &quot;a primitive, a shaman who finds the magic formula and leads people to it&quot;. Great poetry and painting, Kunitz believed, both had &quot;roots in magic, incantation, and spell-casting&quot; and were, at their core, ethical and spiritual. Kunitz instinctively understood the purpose of Rothko&#x27;s quest.

In November 1958, Rothko gave an address to the Pratt Institute. In a tenor unusual for him, he discussed art as a trade and offered the recipe of a work of art—its ingredients—how to make it—the formula

# There must be a clear preoccupation with death—intimations of mortality ... Tragic art, romantic art, etc., deals with the knowledge of death.
# Sensuality. Our basis of being concrete about the world. It is a lustful relationship with things that exist.
# Tension. Either conflict or curbed desire.
# Irony, This is a modern ingredient—the self-effacement and examination by which a man for an instant can go on to something else.
# Wit and play ... for the human element.
# The ephemeral and chance ... for the human element.
# Hope. 10% to make the tragic concept more endurable.

I measure these ingredients very carefully when I paint a picture. It is always the form that follows these elements and the picture results from the proportions of these elements.

===Seagram Murals–Four Seasons restaurant commission===

In 1958, Rothko was awarded the first of two major mural commissions, which proved both rewarding and frustrating. The beverage company Joseph Seagram and Sons had recently completed the new Seagram Building skyscraper on Park Avenue, designed by architects Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson. Rothko agreed to provide paintings for the building&#x27;s new luxury restaurant, the Four Seasons. This was, as art historian Simon Schama put it, &quot;bring[ing] his monumental dramas right into the belly of the beast&quot;.

For Rothko, this Seagram murals commission presented a new challenge, since it was the first time he was required not only to design a coordinated series of paintings but to produce an artwork space concept for a large, specific interior. Over the following three months, Rothko completed forty paintings, comprising three full series in dark red and brown. He altered his horizontal format to vertical, to complement the restaurant&#x27;s vertical features: columns, walls, doors, and windows.

The following June, Rothko and his family again traveled to Europe. While on the SS &quot;Independence&quot; he disclosed to journalist John Fischer, who was publisher of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, that his true intention for the Seagram murals was to paint &quot;something that will ruin the appetite of every son-of-a-bitch who ever eats in that room&quot;. He hoped, he told Fischer, that his painting would make the restaurant&#x27;s patrons &quot;feel that they are trapped in a room where all the doors and windows are bricked up, so that all they can do is butt their heads forever against the wall&quot;.
While in Europe, the Rothkos traveled to Rome, Florence, Venice, and Pompeii. In Florence, he visited Michelangelo&#x27;s Laurentian Library, to see first-hand the library&#x27;s vestibule, from which he drew further inspiration for the murals. He remarked that &quot;the room had exactly the feeling that I wanted ... it gives the visitor the feeling of being caught in a room with the doors and windows walled-in shut.&quot; He was further influenced by the somber colors of the murals in the Pompeiian Villa of the Mysteries. Following the trip to Italy, the Rothkos voyaged to Paris, Brussels, Antwerp and Amsterdam, before going to London, where Rothko spent time in the British Museum studying the Turner watercolors. They then traveled to Somerset and stayed with the artist William Scott, who was just starting a large mural project, and they discussed the respective issues of public and private sponsorship. After the visit the Rothkos continued to St. Ives in the West of England and met up with Patrick Heron and other Cornish painters before returning to London and then the United States.

Back in New York, Rothko and his wife Mell visited the nearly completed Four Seasons restaurant. Upset with the restaurant&#x27;s dining atmosphere, which he considered pretentious and inappropriate for the display of his works, Rothko refused to continue the project and returned his cash advance to the Seagram and Sons Company. Seagram had intended to honor Rothko&#x27;s emergence to prominence through his selection, and his breach of contract and public expression of outrage was unexpected.

Rothko kept the commissioned paintings in storage until 1968. Given that Rothko had known in advance about the luxury decor of the restaurant, and the social class of its future patrons, the motives for his abrupt repudiation remain mysterious, although he did write to his friend William Scott in England, &quot;Since we had discussed our respective murals I thought you might be interested to know that mine are still with me. When I returned, I looked again at my paintings and then visited the premises for which they were destined, it seemed clear to me at once that the two were not for each other.&quot; A temperamental personality, Rothko never fully explained his conflicted emotions over the incident. One reading is offered by his biographer, James E.B. Breslin: the Seagram project could be seen as an acting-out of a familiar, in this case self-created &quot;drama of trust and betrayal, of advancing into the world, then withdrawing, angrily, from it ... He was an Isaac who at the last moment refused to yield to Abraham.&quot; The final series of &quot;Seagram Murals&quot; was dispersed, and now hangs in three locations: London&#x27;s Tate Britain, Japan&#x27;s Kawamura Memorial Museum, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. This episode was the main basis for John Logan&#x27;s 2009 play &quot;Red&quot;.

In October 2012, &quot;Black on Maroon&quot;, one of the paintings in the Seagram series, was defaced with writing in black ink, while on display at Tate Modern. Restoration of the painting took 18 months. The BBC&#x27;s Arts Editor Will Gompertz explained that the ink from the vandal&#x27;s marker pen had bled all the way through the canvas, causing &quot;a deep wound, not a superficial graze&quot;, and that the vandal had caused &quot;significant damage&quot;.

===Rising American prominence===
Rothko&#x27;s first completed space was created in the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., following the purchase of four paintings by collector Duncan Phillips. Rothko&#x27;s fame and wealth had substantially increased; his paintings began to sell to notable collectors, including the Rockefeller family. In January 1961, Rothko sat next to Joseph Kennedy at John F. Kennedy&#x27;s inaugural ball. Later that year, a retrospective of his work was held at the Museum of Modern Art, to considerable commercial and critical success. In spite of this newfound fame, the art world had already turned its attention from the now passé abstract expressionists to the &quot;next big thing&quot;, pop art, particularly the work of Warhol, Lichtenstein, and Rosenquist.

Rothko called pop artists &quot;charlatans and young opportunists&quot;, and wondered aloud during a 1962 exhibition of pop art, &quot;Are the young artists plotting to kill us all?&quot; On viewing Jasper Johns&#x27;s flags, Rothko said, &quot;We worked for years to get rid of all that.&quot;

On August 31, 1963, Mell gave birth to a second child, Christopher. That autumn, Rothko signed with the Marlborough Gallery for sales of his work outside the United States. In New York, he continued to sell the artwork directly from his studio.

===Harvard Murals===
Rothko received a second mural commission project, this time for a room of paintings for the penthouse of Harvard University&#x27;s Holyoke Center. He made 22 sketches, from which ten wall-sized paintings on canvas were painted, six were brought to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and only five were hung: a triptych on one wall and opposite two individual panels. His aim was to create an environment for a public place. Harvard President Nathan Pusey, following an explanation of the religious symbology of the Triptych, had the paintings hung in January 1963, and later shown at the Guggenheim. During installation, Rothko found the paintings to be compromised by the room&#x27;s lighting. Despite the installation of fiberglass shades, the paintings were all removed by 1979 and, due to the fugitive nature of some of the red pigments, in particular lithol red, were placed in dark storage and displayed only periodically. The murals were on display from November 16, 2014, to July 26, 2015, in the newly renovated Harvard Art Museums, for which the fading of the pigments has been compensated by using an innovative color projection system to illuminate the paintings.

===Rothko Chapel===
The Rothko Chapel is adjacent to the Menil Collection and the University of St. Thomas in Houston, Texas. The building is small and windowless except for a skylight and features a geometric, postmodern structure. The chapel, the Menil Collection, and the nearby Cy Twombly gallery were funded by Texas oil millionaires John and Dominique de Menil.

In 1964, Rothko moved into his last New York studio at 157 East 69th Street. To simulate the lighting he wanted for the chapel, he equipped the studio with pulleys carrying large walls of canvas material to regulate light from a central cupola. Rothko reportedly intended the chapel to be his most important artistic statement. He became extremely involved in the building&#x27;s layout and insisted that it feature a central cupola like his studio&#x27;s. Architect Philip Johnson, unable to compromise with Rothko&#x27;s vision about the kind of light he wanted in the space, left the project in 1967 and was replaced by Howard Barnstone and Eugene Aubry. The architects frequently flew to New York to consult. On one occasion they brought a miniature of the building for Rothko&#x27;s approval.

For Rothko, the chapel was a place of pilgrimage far from the center of art (in this case, New York) where seekers of his newly &quot;religious&quot; artwork could journey. The chapel is now nondenominational, but it was originally intended to be Roman Catholic. During the first three years of the project (1964–67), Rothko believed it would remain so. The building&#x27;s design and the paintings&#x27; religious implications were inspired by Roman Catholic art and architecture. Its octagonal shape is based on a Byzantine church of St. Maria Assunta, and the format of the triptychs is based on paintings of the Crucifixion. The de Menils believed the universal &quot;spiritual&quot; aspect of Rothko&#x27;s work would complement the elements of Roman Catholicism.

Rothko&#x27;s painting technique necessitated physical strength and stamina that the ailing artist could no longer muster. He hired two assistants to apply the multiple layers of paint. On half of the works, Rothko applied none of the paint himself and was content to supervise the slow, arduous process. He felt the completion of the paintings to be &quot;torment&quot;, and the inevitable result was to create &quot;something you don&#x27;t want to look at&quot;.

The chapel represents six years of Rothko&#x27;s life and his growing concern for the transcendent. For some, viewing the chapel&#x27;s these paintings is akin submitting to a spiritual experience. The paintings have been likened to self-awareness, hermeticism, and contemplativeness.

The chapel paintings consist of a monochrome triptych in soft brown, on the central wall, comprising three 5-by-15-foot panels and a pair of triptychs on the left and right made of opaque black rectangles. Between the triptychs are four individual paintings, measuring 11-by-15 feet each. One additional individual painting faces the central triptych, from the opposite wall. The effect is to surround the viewer with massive, imposing visions of darkness. Despite its basis in religious symbolism and imagery, the paintings may be considered distinct from traditional Christian motifs and may act on the viewers subliminally. Rothko&#x27;s erasure of symbols both removes and creates barriers to the work.

The paintings were unveiled at the chapel&#x27;s opening in 1971. Rothko never saw the completed chapel and never installed the paintings. On February 28, 1971, at the dedication, Dominique de Menil said, &quot;We are cluttered with images and only abstract art can bring us to the threshold of the divine&quot;, noting Rothko&#x27;s courage in painting &quot;impenetrable fortresses&quot; of color.

==Suicide and estate lawsuit==

In early 1968, Rothko was diagnosed with a mild aortic aneurysm. Ignoring doctor&#x27;s orders, he continued to drink and smoke heavily, avoided exercise, and maintained an unhealthy diet. &quot;Highly nervous, thin, restless&quot;, was his friend Dore Ashton&#x27;s description of Rothko at this time. But Rothko did take the medical advice not to paint pictures taller than three feet, and turned his attention to smaller, less physically strenuous formats, including acrylics on paper. Meanwhile, his marriage became increasingly troubled, and his poor health and impotence resulting from the aneurysm compounded his feeling of estrangement in the relationship. Rothko and Mell, who had been married from 1944, separated on New Year&#x27;s Day 1969; he moved into his studio.

On February 25, 1970, Oliver Steindecker, Rothko&#x27;s assistant, found the artist lying dead on the kitchen floor in front of the sink, covered in blood. He had overdosed on barbiturates and cut an artery in his right arm with a razor blade. There was no suicide note. He was 66. The Seagram Murals arrived in London for display at the Tate Gallery on the day of his suicide.

Near the end of his life, Rothko painted a series known as the &quot;Black on Grays&quot;, uniformly featuring a black rectangle above a gray rectangle. These canvases and Rothko&#x27;s later work in general have been associated with his depression and suicide, although the association has been criticized. Rothko&#x27;s suicide has been studied in medical literature, where his later paintings have been interpreted as &quot;pictorial suicide notes&quot; due to their somber palettes and especially in contrast to the brighter colors Rothko employed more frequently during the 1950s. Although art critic David Anfam acknowledged that the Black and Grays are interpreted as premonitions of suicide or as &quot;moonscapes&quot; (the first Apollo Moon landings were contemporaneous with their execution), he rejected the interpretations as &quot;naive&quot;, arguing instead that the paintings were a continuation of his lifelong artistic themes and not symptoms of depression. Susan Grange observed that, after his aneurysm, Rothko executed several smaller works on paper using lighter hues, which are less well-known. Throughout his life Rothko consistently intended his works to evoke serious dramatic content, regardless of the colors used in a particular painting. When a woman visited his studio asking to buy a &quot;happy&quot; painting featuring warm colors, Rothko retorted, &quot;Red, yellow, orange – aren&#x27;t those the colors of an inferno?&quot;
Shortly before his death, Rothko and his financial advisor, Bernard Reis, created a foundation intended to fund &quot;research and education&quot; that received the bulk of Rothko&#x27;s work after his death. Reis later sold the paintings to the Marlborough Gallery, at substantially reduced values, and then split the profits from sales with Gallery representatives. In 1971, Rothko&#x27;s daughter Kate, who was 19 at the time of his death, sued Reis, Morton Levine, and Theodore Stamos, the executors of his estate, over the sham sales. The lawsuit continued for more than 10 years and became known as the Rothko Case. In 1975, the defendants were found liable for negligence and conflict of interest, were removed as executors of the Rothko estate by court order, and, along with Marlborough Gallery, were required to pay $9.2 million in damages to the estate. This amount represents only a small fraction of the eventual value of numerous Rothko works. Marlborough Gallery was also required to return the remaining 658 unsold paintings to two parties. One half of the remaining paintings were given to Rothko&#x27;s estate, which was now controlled by Kate in addition to, eventually, her brother Christopher, who was 6 years old at the time of Rothko&#x27;s death. The other half were given to the Mark Rothko Foundation, which the court had reestablished as part of the lawsuit proceedings, appointing investment banker and art collector Donald M. Blinken as the foundation&#x27;s president.

Rothko&#x27;s estranged wife Mell, also a heavy drinker, died six months after him at the age of 48. The cause of death was listed as &quot;hypertension due to cardiovascular disease&quot;.

==Legacy==
After being reestablished by the court during the lawsuit proceedings following Rothko&#x27;s death, the Mark Rothko Foundation donated the entirety of its holdings of Rothko&#x27;s art to 35 museums and art institutions in the United States and Europe. Separately from the foundation, Kate and Christopher, as the executors of Rothko&#x27;s estate following the lawsuit, have donated several of their holdings of Rothko&#x27;s art to museums, and, as of 2021, continued to sell paintings from the estate&#x27;s collection through Pace Gallery.

Rothko&#x27;s complete works on canvas, 836 paintings, have been catalogued by art historian David Anfam, in his &quot;Mark Rothko: The Works on Canvas: Catalogue Raisonné&quot; (1998), published by Yale University Press.

A previously unpublished manuscript by Rothko, &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Reality&quot; (2004), about his philosophies on art, edited by his son Christopher, was published by Yale University Press.

&quot;Red&quot;, a play by John Logan based on Rothko&#x27;s life, opened at the Donmar Warehouse in London, on December 3, 2009. The play, starring Alfred Molina and Eddie Redmayne, centered on the period of the Seagram Murals. This drama received excellent reviews and usually played to full houses. In 2010 &quot;Red&quot; opened on Broadway, where it won six Tony Awards, including Best Play. Molina played Rothko in both London and New York. A recording of &quot;Red&quot; was produced in 2018 for Great Performances with Molina playing Rothko and Alfred Enoch playing his assistant.

In Rothko&#x27;s birthplace, the Latvian city of Daugavpils, a monument to him, designed by sculptor Romualds Gibovskis, was unveiled on the bank of the Daugava River in 2003. In 2013 the Mark Rothko Art Centre opened in Daugavpils after the Rothko family had donated a small collection of his original works.

A number of Rothko&#x27;s works are held by the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía and by the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, both in Madrid. The Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, New York includes both Rothko&#x27;s painting &quot;Untitled&quot; (1967) and a large mural by Al Held, &quot;Rothko&#x27;s Canvas&quot; (1969–70).

Fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy showed fabrics inspired by Rothko in 1971. A number of musical compositions have been inspired by Rothko&#x27;s work, including Adam Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Finding Rothko&quot; (2006) and Anna Clyne&#x27;s &quot;Color Field&quot; (2020).

==Resale market==
Prices for Rothko&#x27;s work on the secondary market and at auction rose significantly toward the end of his career and after his death, and have consistently remained among the highest for works of art by a modern or contemporary artist. Three years prior to his death, a work by Rothko sold on the secondary market for $22,000; in 2003 a painting by Rothko sold for $7,175,000. Rothko&#x27;s paintings sold at successively higher prices at auction through the mid-2010s, reaching $86.8 million in 2012, a record for Rothko and, at the time, a new nominal value record for any postwar painting sold at a public auction.

Works by Rothko have continued to regularly achieve prices at auction ranging as high as $80 million through the 2020s. His painting &quot;No. 6 (Violet, Green and Red)&quot; sold in 2014 for $186 million.

<text>Hans Michael Frank (23 May 1900 – 16 October 1946) was a German politician, war criminal, and lawyer who served as head of the General Government in German-occupied Poland during the Second World War.

Frank was an early member of the German Workers&#x27; Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party (NSDAP). He took part in the failed Beer Hall Putsch, and later became Adolf Hitler&#x27;s personal legal adviser as well as the lawyer of the NSDAP. In June 1933, he was named as a &quot;&quot; (Reich Leader) of the party. In December 1934, Frank joined the Hitler Cabinet as a &quot;Reichsminister&quot; without portfolio.

After the German invasion of Poland in 1939, Frank was appointed Governor-General of the occupied Polish territories. During his tenure, he instituted a reign of terror against the civilian population and became directly involved in the mass murder of Jews. He engaged in the use of forced labour and oversaw four of the extermination camps. Frank remained head of the General Government until its collapse in early 1945. During that time, over 4 million people were murdered under his jurisdiction.

After the war, Frank was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials. He was sentenced to death and executed by hanging in October 1946.

==Early years==
Frank, the middle child of three, was born in Karlsruhe to Karl, a lawyer, and his wife, Magdalena (née Buchmaier), a daughter of a prosperous baker. He graduated from high school at Maximilians &quot;gymnasium&quot; in Munich. At seventeen he joined the German Army fighting in World War I, but did not serve time at the front.

After the war, Frank studied law and economics, from 1919 to the summer semester of 1921 at the University of Munich, between 1921 and 1922 at the University of Kiel, and back from the winter semester 1922 to 1923 at Munich. On 21 July 1923, he passed the final exam there, obtaining his Dr. jur. degree in 1924.

Between 1919 and 1920, he was a member of the Thule Völkisch society. He served also in the &quot;Freikorps&quot; under Franz Ritter von Epp&#x27;s command, taking part in the crackdown of the Münchner Räterepublik. In 1919, as did other members of the Thule Society, he joined the German Workers&#x27; Party (DAP) at its beginning.

==Nazi Party career==
Although the DAP evolved quite soon into NSDAP (Nazi Party), Frank waited until September 1923 to become a member of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), where he would eventually attain the rank of SA-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; in November 1937. In October 1923, he officially joined the NSDAP. In November of the same year, Frank took part in the &quot;Beer Hall Putsch&quot;, the failed coup attempt intended to parallel Mussolini&#x27;s March on Rome. In the aftermath of the attempted putsch, Frank fled to Austria, returning to Munich only in 1924, after the pending legal proceedings were stayed.

Frank rose to become Adolf Hitler&#x27;s personal legal adviser. As the Nazis rose to power, Frank also served as the party&#x27;s lawyer. He represented it in over 2,400 cases and spent over $10,000. This sometimes brought him into conflict with other lawyers. Once, a former teacher appealed to him: &quot;I beg you to leave these people alone! No good will come of it! Political movements that begin in the criminal courts will end in the criminal courts!&quot; In September–October 1930, Frank served as the defence lawyer at the court-martial in Leipzig of Lieutenants Richard Scheringer, Hans Friedrich Wendt and Hanns Ludin, three &quot;Reichswehr&quot; officers charged with membership in the NSDAP. The trial was a media sensation. Hitler himself testified and the defence successfully put the Weimar Republic itself on trial. Many Army officers developed a sympathetic view of the Nazi movement as a consequence. In October 1928, Frank founded the National Socialist German Jurists Association and became its leader. He was also elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; from electoral constituency 8, Leignitz, in October 1930.
On 10 March 1933, when the Nazis seized control of the Bavarian state government, Frank was made the &quot;Staatskommissar&quot; (State Commissioner) in charge of justice, and also was appointed one of the state&#x27;s representatives to the &quot;Reichsrat&quot; until its abolition on 14 February 1934. In April 1933, he was appointed Minister of Justice for Bavaria, serving until December 1934 when he was named a &quot;Reichsminister&quot; without portfolio in the Reich government. On 2 June 1933, he was made a &quot;Reichsleiter&quot;, the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party, in his capacity as head of the party&#x27;s legal affairs department. On 26 June 1933, Frank founded the Academy for German Law. At its inaugural meeting on 2 October 1933, he was named its Leader (renamed President on 9 August 1934) and would continue in this capacity until 20 August 1942 when he also left his positions as &quot;Reichsleiter&quot; and head of the Jurists Association. Frank also served as the Chairman of the Academy&#x27;s Legal Philosophy Committee and was editor of its several publications. In January 1934, Frank was named as one of the three judges on the Supreme Party Court.

In March 1933, in a speech on the Bavarian radio, Frank issued &quot;a greeting to his oppressed comrades in Austria&quot; and threatened that, if necessary, the Nazi Party would &quot;take over the safeguarding of the freedom of the German comrades in Austria&quot;. The Austrian government officially protested in Berlin, but Hitler denied responsibility for Frank&#x27;s words. In May 1933, Frank went to Vienna, accompanied by the Prussian Minister of Justice Hanns Kerrl and his Ministerial Director Roland Freisler, to promote Nazi propaganda. Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss declared their presence in Austria undesirable, and had them deported. In response, Hitler imposed the thousand-mark ban to weaken the Austrian economy, which was heavily dependent on tourism, and Austrian Nazis launched a wave of terrorist attacks, which ultimately led to the banning of the Nazi Party in Austria on 19 June 1933. 

Frank objected to extrajudicial killings as it weakened the power of the legal system (of which he himself was a prominent member), both at the Dachau concentration camp and during the &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot;. Frank&#x27;s view of what the judicial process required was that:
On 7 April 1938, Frank addressed some 10,000 Nazis at the Passau &quot;Nibelungenhalle&quot;.

==Governor-General in Poland==

In September 1939, Frank was assigned as Chief of Administration to Gerd von Rundstedt in the German military administration in occupied Poland. Beginning on 26 October 1939, following the completion of the invasion of Poland, Frank served as Governor-General of the occupied Polish territories, overseeing the General Government, the area of Poland not directly incorporated into Germany (roughly 90,000 km2 out of the 187,000 km2 Germany had gained).

Frank oversaw the segregation of the Jews into ghettos. From the outset, Jews were discriminated against savagely and the rations given to them were slender. He oversaw the Warsaw ghetto and the use of Polish civilians as forced labour. In 1942, he lost his positions of authority outside the General Government after annoying Hitler with a series of speeches in Berlin, Vienna, Heidelberg, and Munich and as part of a power struggle with Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger, the State Secretary for Security – head of the SS and the police in the General Government. Krüger himself was ultimately replaced by Wilhelm Koppe.

On 16 December 1941, Frank spelt out to his senior officials the approaching annihilation of the Jews:A great Jewish migration will begin in any case. But what should we do with the Jews? Do you think they will be settled in Ostland, in villages? We were told in Berlin, &#x27;Why all this bother? We can do nothing with them either in Ostland or in the Reichskommissariat. So liquidate them yourselves.&#x27; Gentlemen, I must ask you to rid yourself of all feelings of pity. We must annihilate the Jews wherever we find them and whenever it is possible.

When this was read to him at the Nuremberg trials he said:One has to take the diary as a whole. You cannot go through 43 volumes and pick out single sentences and separate them from their context. I would like to say here that I do not want to argue or quibble about individual phrases. It was a wild and stormy period filled with terrible passions, and when a whole country is on fire and a life and death struggle is going on, such words may easily be used... Some of the words are terrible. I myself must admit that I was shocked at many of the words which I had used... A thousand years will pass and still this guilt of Germany will not have been erased.

An assassination attempt by the Polish Secret State on 29/30 January 1944 (the night preceding the 11th anniversary of Hitler&#x27;s appointment as Chancellor of Germany) in Szarów near Kraków failed. A special train with Frank travelling to Lemberg/Lvov/Lviv was derailed after an explosive device discharged but no one was killed. Around 100 Polish hostages from Montelupich prison were executed as a punishment for the act.

==Death camps==
Hans Frank participated in the growth of the politics leading to genocide in Poland. Under his guidance, mass murder became a deliberate policy. The General Government was the location of four out of six extermination camps, namely: Bełżec, Treblinka, Majdanek and Sobibór; Chełmno and Birkenau fell just outside the borders of the General Government. Frank later claimed that the extermination of Jews was entirely controlled by Heinrich Himmler and the SS, and he — Frank — was unaware of the extermination camps in the General Government until early 1944, an assertion found to be untrue by the Nuremberg tribunal. During his testimony at Nuremberg, Frank claimed he submitted resignation requests to Hitler on 14 occasions, but Hitler would not allow him to resign. Frank fled the General Government in January 1945, as the Red Army advanced.

==Capture and trial==

Frank was captured by American troops on 4 May 1945, at Tegernsee in southern Bavaria. He attempted suicide twice. He was indicted for war crimes and tried before the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg from 20 November 1945 to 1 October 1946. During the trial he converted, guided by Fr Sixtus O&#x27;Connor , to Roman Catholicism, and claimed to have had a series of religious experiences.

Frank voluntarily surrendered 43 volumes of his personal diaries to the Allies, believing his struggles against other Nazi officials would be enough to secure his defence, and which were then used against him as evidence of his guilt. Frank confessed to some of the charges, and testified in response to questions from his defence attorney:
after having heard the testimony of the witness Rudolf Höss, my conscience does not allow me to throw the responsibility solely on these minor people. I myself have never installed an extermination camp for Jews, or promoted the existence of such camps; but if Adolf Hitler personally has laid that dreadful responsibility on his people, then it is mine too, for we have fought against Jewry for years; and we have indulged in the most horrible utterances.

During his captivity, he penned a series of letters in which he also left his last thoughts. To his son Norman, he wrote that he preferred to die and join the &quot;brave soldiers, who were (...) killed in this war&quot; than &quot;be dealt in revenge from [migrants], traitors&quot;, from those such as Willy Brandt.

During their trials, he and Albert Speer were the only defendants to show any degree of remorse for their crimes, though, according to his son Niklas, he portrayed himself as a &quot;man of the law&quot;, and was not personally acknowledging guilt, rather shifting it to the &quot;German people&quot; as a whole. At the same time, he accused the Allies, especially the Soviets, of their own wartime atrocities. Frank was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity on 1 October 1946 and was sentenced to death by hanging. The death sentence was carried out at Nuremberg Prison on 16 October by US Army Master Sergeant John C. Woods. Journalist Joseph Kingsbury-Smith wrote of the execution:

He answered to his name quietly and when asked for any last statement, he replied &quot;I am thankful for the kind treatment during my captivity and I ask God to accept me with mercy.&quot;

His body and those of the other nine executed prisoners and the corpse of Hermann Göring were cremated at Ostfriedhof (Munich) and the ashes were scattered in the river Isar.

==Memoirs==

While awaiting execution, he wrote his memoirs, &quot;Im Angesicht des Galgens&quot; (In the Face of the Gallows), later published by his widow. In the capacity as his attorney, Frank was privy to personal details of Hitler&#x27;s life. In his memoirs, Frank made the sensational claim that Hitler had commissioned him to investigate Hitler&#x27;s family in 1930 after a &quot;blackmail letter&quot; had been received from Hitler&#x27;s nephew, William Patrick Hitler, who allegedly threatened to reveal embarrassing facts about his uncle&#x27;s ancestry. Frank said that the investigation uncovered evidence that Maria Schicklgruber, Hitler&#x27;s paternal grandmother, had been working as a cook in the household of a Jewish man named Leopold Frankenberger before she gave birth to Hitler&#x27;s father, Alois, out of wedlock. Frank claimed that he had obtained from a relative of Hitler&#x27;s by marriage a collection of letters between Maria Schicklgruber and a member of the Frankenberger family that discussed a stipend for her after she left the family&#x27;s employ. According to Frank, Hitler told him that the letters did not prove that the Frankenberger son was his father but rather his grandmother had merely extorted money from Frankenberger by threatening to claim his paternity of her illegitimate child.

Frank accepted this explanation, but added that it was still just possible that Hitler had some Jewish ancestry. But he thought it unlikely because, &quot;from his entire demeanor, the fact that Adolf Hitler had no Jewish blood coursing through his veins seems so clearly evident that nothing more need be said on this.&quot;

Given that all Jews had been expelled from the province of Styria (which includes Graz) in the 15th century and were not allowed to return until the 1860s, scholars such as Ian Kershaw and Brigitte Hamann dismiss as baseless the &quot;Frankenberger hypothesis&quot;, which before had only Frank&#x27;s speculation to support it. More recent scholarship by Leonard Sax points out that many Jews lived in places without official sanction and demonstrated the existence of a settled Jewish community in Graz before the law formally permitted their residence. Nevertheless, there is no evidence outside of Frank&#x27;s statements for the existence of a &quot;Leopold Frankenberger&quot; living in Graz in the 1830s, and Frank&#x27;s story is inaccurate on several points such as the claim that Maria Schicklgruber came from &quot;Leonding near Linz&quot;, when in fact she came from the hamlet of Strones near the village of Döllersheim. Some suggest that Frank (who turned against Nazism in his defence after 1945 but remained an anti-Semitic fanatic) made the claim that Hitler had Jewish ancestry as a way of proving that Hitler was really a &quot;Jew&quot; and not an &quot;Aryan&quot;, and in this way &quot;proved&quot; that the Third Reich&#x27;s crimes were the work of the &quot;Jewish&quot; Hitler. The full anti-Semitic implications of Frank&#x27;s story were borne out in a letter entitled &quot;Was Hitler a Jew?&quot;, written to the editor of a Saudi newspaper in 1982 by a German man living in Saudi Arabia. The writer accepted Frank&#x27;s story as the truth, and added since Hitler was a Jew, &quot;the Jews should pay Germans reparations for the War, because &quot;one of theirs&quot; caused the destruction of Germany&quot;.

But Jewish-American author Ron Rosenbaum suggested another reason for Frank&#x27;s story:On the other hand, a different version of Frank emerges in the brilliantly vicious, utterly unforgiving portrait of him by his son, Niklas Frank, who (in a memoir called &quot;In the Shadow of the Reich&quot;) depicts his father as a craven coward and weakling, but one not without a kind of animal cunning, an instinct for lying, insinuation, self-aggrandizement. For &quot;this&quot; Hans Frank, disgraced and facing death on the gallows for following Hitler, fabricating such a story might be a cunning way of ensuring his place in history as the one man who gave the world the hidden key to the mystery of Hitler&#x27;s psyche. While at the same time, revenging himself on his former master for having led him to this end by foisting a sordid and humiliating explanation of Hitler on him for all posterity. In any case, it was one Frank knew the victors would find seductive.

==Family==
On 2 April 1925 Frank married 29-year-old secretary Brigitte Herbst (29 December 1895 – 9 March 1959) from Forst (Lausitz). The wedding took place in Munich and the couple honeymooned in Venetia. Hans and Brigitte Frank had five children:
* Sigrid Frank (born 17 March 1927 and died in South Africa)
* Norman Frank (3 June 1928 – March 2009)
* Brigitte Frank (13 January 1935 – 1981)
* Michael Frank (15 February 1937 – 1990)
* Niklas Frank (born 9 March 1939)

Brigitte Herbst had a reputation for having a more dominant personality than her husband: after 1939 she called herself &quot;a queen of Poland&quot; (&quot;Königin von Polen&quot;), which began as a jest from her husband at the time of his nomination. The marriage was unhappy and became colder from year to year, with Brigitte having many affairs, which weren&#x27;t unknown amongst her children, including resulting rumours on there being different fathers. Frank sought a divorce in 1942, after meeting and falling in love with a former childhood acquaintance who was looking for her son, a soldier who had gone missing in the Eastern Front. Brigitte made great efforts to save their marriage in order to remain the &quot;First Lady in the General Government&quot;. One of her most famous comments was &quot;I&#x27;d rather be widowed than divorced from a Reichsminister!&quot; Frank answered: &quot;So you are my deadly enemy!&quot; Besides making her children intercede for her with their father, she would go on to contact Himmler and Mrs. Goebbels, who would get Hitler to personally forbid Frank from divorcing his wife.

Contrary to Hans&#x27; later stance on the concentration camps and ghettos, the children were not isolated from them, despite them not being a topic their parents discussed directly with them. The youngest, Niklas, was often taken to a concentration camp by Hilde, their nanny. On one occasion, for Niklas and his brother Norman&#x27;s enjoyment, the guards made undernourished prisoners sit on a donkey, which would then be made to jump and throw the compulsed riders to the ground. Niklas would also be told that a sad prisoner was a &quot;witch&quot;, but one whom he did not have to worry about, since she would &quot;dead very soon&quot;. At another point, a Polish servant soiled bed sheets with soot, and his mother screamed he would be sent to the camps. Niklas, who had befriended the Pole, heard this and began to cry, which made his mother stop scolding the man and start comforting her son. In the end, she let the matter go, and after the war the man and his wife would credit Niklas with saving their lives.

All but Niklas would grieve their father at the time of his execution, feeling he was &quot;innocent&quot;. Niklas Frank had been shunned early on by his parental figure, because of his father&#x27;s belief he was instead the son a former family friend, Karl Lasch, and so he instead bonded closer to Hilde, their nanny, and also felt closer to his mother than his father. According to Niklas, his siblings&#x27; &quot;brains&quot; had been &quot;poisoned&quot; by their father. Niklas, who in his early adult years became a journalist for the Time magazine in Germany, would also participate in the early printing of &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;. In 1987, Niklas Frank wrote a book about his father, &quot;Der Vater: Eine Abrechnung&quot; (&quot;The Father: A Settling of Accounts&quot;), which was published in English in 1991 as &quot;In the Shadow of the Reich&quot;. The book, first of a trilogy about his family&#x27;s experiences, was serialized in the magazine &quot;Stern&quot;, and caused controversy in Germany, and even in some sectors of Poland, because of the scathing way in which the younger Frank depicted his father: Niklas referred to him as &quot;a slime-hole of a Hitler fanatic&quot; and questioned his remorse before his execution. In his work, Niklas also created a compilation of Nazi-era films of the Frank family.

The scars of having Hans as a parent would seemingly carry on not quite healed. Michael, the closest to Niklas in their youth, though an ardent defender of their father&#x27;s innocence, would develop an addiction for milk, to the point his wife would struggle to save some for their children, and which go on to cause severe obesity and in consequence organ failure. Michael died in 1990, at 53 years old.

Norman, whose last words from his father was that Norman should be silent (which would lead to tensions between him and Niklas, whose work was often about documenting insights into his family), would also become addicted, to alcohol. Though he recognized and was critical of his father&#x27;s political work and nazi rhetoric of his recorded speeches, Norman followed his father&#x27;s advice on silence and so was critical of Niklas&#x27; work though he later privately confessed being proud of his brother. 

Brigitte committed suicide in 1981, at 46 years old; and Niklas would claim the motivation was &quot;because she didn&#x27;t want to become older&quot; than their father. Niklas would come to believe this despite the fact his sister had cancer, but which the doctors claimed she could have survived about five to seven years. According to Niklas, she had written in her 16 year old diary she didn’t want to became older than their father, and made it so it happened. She took her own life by overdosing whilst sleeping with her 8 year old son, Hans&#x27; grandson.

Despite as a young woman, in 1945, being worried that they wouldn&#x27;t be forgiven for &quot;what we have done to the Jews&quot;, worried then of deadly retaliations, Sigrid remained a committed Nazi who emigrated to South Africa during the apartheid regime and, having developed an addiction for tranquilizers, died there.

Niklas is the sole living child of Hans and Brigitte Frank. Despite severe differences, specially when it came to Hans Frank&#x27;s memory, Hans&#x27; family would remain unestranged all throughout their lives, not letting their differences destroy the relationships, no matter how fiercely they disagreed on the facts of the father&#x27;s crimes.

Whilst some, if not all, of Hans&#x27; grandchildren have been noticeably affected by the events of their grandfather&#x27;s life, Niklas&#x27; daughter has claimed her father&#x27;s critical work about her grandfather was a &quot;wall&quot; around her, growing up.

<doc id="127662" wikidata="Q1990446" url="?curid=127662" title="Chocowinity, North Carolina">
<text>Chocowinity ( ) is a town in Beaufort County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 722 at the 2020 census. The town is a part of the Washington Area located in North Carolina&#x27;s Coastal Plains region.

==History==
The meaning of the name Chocowinity appears to be derived from the Tuscarora word &quot;chackauene&quot;, meaning &quot;otter&quot; or &quot;little otters.&quot; However, most people from the area insist that the name actually means &quot;fish in many waters.&quot; In 1928, Rev. N.C. Hughes, D.D., met a well-educated Native American encamped on the banks of the Edisto River in South Carolina. While talking with him, Hughes mentioned he lived in a small village with a Native American name. Hughes pronounced the name &quot;Chocowinity&quot; and also spelled its former name of &quot;Chocawanateth.&quot; The Indian thought for a moment and finally responded, &quot;Oh yes, I have it now. That word means FISH FROM MANY WATERS.&quot;

In the early 20th century, Chocowinity became the railroad hub of the regional system known as the Norfolk Southern Railway in 1910. The town is sometimes called Marsden as a result of a railroad communications problem. Around 1917, the railway started calling the pivotal location &quot;Marsden&quot;, which was easier to spell on a telegraph than &quot;Chocowinity&quot;. The source of the new name was apparently taken in honor of one of its financial backers, Marsden J. Perry of New York, who eventually served as president of the railroad.

The regional Norfolk Southern (one of the predecessors of the modern system which adopted the same name) had lines between Norfolk, Virginia and Charlotte and served many locations in southeastern Virginia (including branches to Virginia Beach and Suffolk) and most of eastern and central North Carolina, including Raleigh, Elizabeth City, New Bern, Morehead City, Goldsboro, Durham, Fayetteville, Asheville, and Greenville. The regional carrier was acquired by the Southern Railway, and lent its historic name to the merger with the Norfolk and Western in the early 1980s to form the current large Norfolk Southern Railway System. The railroad resumed using &quot;Chocowinity&quot; to designate the location in 1970, after railway telegraphs were replaced with voice communications via 2-way radios.

The Trinity Episcopal Cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

The most recent tornado, rated EF2, was on April 7, 2014. It rolled along Pantego Creek, ran along one of its canals, Cuckold&#x27;s Creek, and almost hit a railroad bridge and Highway 264, it took a turn, hit through a small marsh, split a house in half, and threw a truck over 40 feet high and threw it in a nearby field, the two occurred five feet from each other, the tornado then curved into a forest, destroying a Hardee&#x27;s billboard, and rolled across the Cuckold&#x27;s Creek again, and it slid along a field, until it curved into four houses on one side of the road, turned, hit another house across the street, hit another field. A man in a plane flew over the field it crossed, and he saw curved and grooves in the dirt, revealing &quot;arcs&quot; in the field suggesting it was a multiple-vortex tornado. It also hit a two-story house, taking the top floor off the house, and leaving the bottom floor, continued until it hit a house in Ponzer, approximately 15 miles from Pantego, and leveled that house. Marc Van Essendelf, his seven children, and his wife, who was eight months pregnant, hid in a ditch; the house was splintered and obliterated. There was a near-miss with another tornado that hit Whichard&#x27;s Beach and Washington. It was the first EF-3 tornado of the 2014 season, and it almost continued into Pantego.

The Pantego Academy was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

<doc id="127673" wikidata="Q2026656" url="?curid=127673" title="Roxobel, North Carolina">
<text>Roxobel is a town in northwestern Bertie County, North Carolina, United States. It dates to 1724 and was originally known as Cotten&#x27;s Cross Roads. After several name changes, it has remained Roxobel since 1849. The population was 240 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Roxobel Township, in the northwest corner of Bertie County, North Carolina, consists of the twin towns of Roxobel and Kelford and the surrounding 60 square miles of farms and plantations. It stretches from Roxobel in the north to the outskirts of Woodville in the south, and from the Roanoke River in the west to the border of Aulander in the east.

Roxobel is the older town, dating to the early eighteenth century. In 1719, John Cotten, a major slave plantation owner from South Quay, Virginia, purchased 540 acres of land in what is now Bertie County and neighbouring Hertford County. He and his large family established settlements and plantations across this land. His son, Samuel Cotten, had already set up home in the area that became Roxobel and these lands were part of those acquired by his father.  He inherited the land on his father’s death, but he was hardly a model citizen: “Little is known of Samuel Cotten, except that he was hardy, vigorous, domineering and rich. He was not at all conventional in his relations with women and some other things, I suspect, and having lived to a great age more feared than loved.” The settlement was located at the intersection of two roads, one leading south to the Roanoke River, the other heading west, and was initially known as Cotten&#x27;s Cross Roads.

In 1756 the Cotten family moved to their plantation in Northampton County and the Granbery family moved into the area. William Granbery was a plantation owner and Thomas Granbery was a timber and furniture merchant. Around 1808, possibly to commemorate William Granbery who died that year, the town was renamed Granberys Cross Roads.

An indication of the growing population in the area was the establishment of the Bertie Church. Initially when it was set up in 1740 it was an ad hoc branch of a neighboring church, but in 1750 it was constituted as an independent Baptist church with its own pastor. Included in its congregation at the turn of the nineteenth century were 125 enslaved people from the local plantations. In the early nineteenth century the church moved a mile out of town to Sandy Run and became known as the Sandy Run Baptist Church and, although the church moved back into the town in 1854, it retained this name. A masonic lodge was also formed in 1799, with the Davie Lodge No. 39. This had a membership of around 20 of the area’s prominent landowners and businessmen, although several members were expelled in its early years as they fell foul of the strict masonic code of behaviour.

Around 1815 William Britton, a successful merchant and farmer from Petersburg, Virginia, moved into the area and purchased the general store. By 1819 he had taken over the post office. The town then became known as Britton’s Store or Britton’s Cross Roads. This name was considered by the post office to be too similar to Britton’s Neck in South Carolina and so in December 1847 the town was renamed Roxobel after Mary Martha Sherwood’s popular 1831 novel &quot;Roxobel&quot;.

By 1830 the Roanoke River had been made navigable for steamboats and with the small landing stage of Norfleet’s Ferry just two miles south of Roxobel this spurred the town’s growth as a trading center. Roxobel became connected by rail when the Roanoke and Tar Railroad was opened in 1888 and this brought renewed prosperity to the town. By 1906 Roxobel’s population was nearing 400 and was served by six retail stores, a wholesale store, two churches and a school. The second church was the Episcopal Church, St Marks, which was established in 1881. The school was Roxobel Academy, which was established in 1890 with a roll of about 30 pupils. The growing commercial needs of the town were serviced by the Bank of Roxobel, which was opened in 1908.  

The town of Kelford lies two miles south of Roxobel and was laid out in 1890 in response to the construction of the Norfolk and Carolina Railroad. The station was opened, and the town incorporated, in 1892. The town included stores, a hotel, a Baptist church, a school and a bank. By 1910 it had a population of just over 300. In 1914 a Coca-Cola bottling plant was opened in the town and became one of the town’s major employers. After rapid expansion the town suffered during the depression years when several businesses folded, the hotel and the bank closed and the school roll was combined with Roxobel.

In 1943 a tornado ripped through Roxobel, killing six inhabitants and causing massive damage. Twenty-five homes and 12 store buildings were completely destroyed and the Methodist church was lifted several hundred feet into the air and smashed to the ground. Around 50 other buildings were badly damaged. Further tornadoes in 1984 and 1988 caused similar destruction.

As well as the two towns in Roxobel Township there were a number of significant plantations. The largest plantation owner in the area was Stephen Andrews Norfleet (1822-1910) who had several cotton plantations in Bertie County, including Woodbourne, Indian Woods, Norfleet&#x27;s Ferry, and Kelford. His father, Thomas Figuers Norfleet, established the Woodbourne estate around 1810 and he inherited it following his father’s death in 1838. Kelford Plantation was established when Stephen A. Norfleet bought 600 acres of land from the heirs of the Granbery family in 1848-1850. He erected a home known as Kelford on the plantation, which later gave its name to the nearby town. By the time of the Civil War, Norfleet owned 150 slaves and 4,000 acres of land in Bertie County. His plantation journals and accounts from 1844 to 1895 have survived and contain records of the enslaved and formerly enslaved people on his plantations. During the American Civil War he was appointed Colonel of the Bertie Country Militia and was put in charge of the county’s Confederate military affairs.

The Pineview plantation was established when 325 acres of land were purchased from the Granbery family by Joshua Brown in 1835. By 1850 he owned 17 enslaved people and 394 acres of farmland, which was used for livestock, corn, peas, sweet potatoes, and cotton. His son, Joseph Henry Browne, inherited the estate in 1856 and expanded it to 500 acres. During the Civil War, Browne served as a lieutenant in the Confederate army.

The Oaklana plantation was created in 1825 when Perry Cotten Tyler purchased 240 acres of land to the north of Roxobel for the production of corn and cotton. By 1850 Tyler owned of 3,000 acres of and 34 enslaved people. His son, John E. Tyler, took over the plantation in 1886 and as well as his farming interests he was a scholar of Latin and Greek, published poetry and obtained patents for numerous inventions for farming equipment, ordnance, and mechanical tools. He also served as a judge of the Inferior Court of Bertie County.

Oaklana, Pineview, and Woodbourne are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Bladenboro is a town in Bladen County, North Carolina, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 1,648.

==History==

===Establishment and early years===

Development around Bladenboro, a farming community also known in its earliest days for its turpentine and lumber, began to take off after a railroad was built through the area in 1859. In 1885, brothers R.L. and H.C. Bridger came to Bladenboro from Little River, South Carolina, to operate a turpentine business. They soon became involved in the timber business and operated a cotton gin. The brothers and their descendants would have a major effect on the shaping of the town and its economy for much of the next century. Major businesses, owned and operated by members of the Bridger family and which employed many area residents, have included Bridger Corporation (a farming supply company and general store no longer in operation), Bladenboro Cotton Mills (established in 1912 and later sold to become Highland Mills), and the Bank of Bladenboro (established in 1908 and now part of First Citizens Bank).

The town of Bladenboro was incorporated in 1903.

===Beast of Bladenboro===
In 1954, Bladenboro received national attention for several mysterious animal killings, mostly of dogs and livestock, in the area. The animals had broken jaws and had been drained of blood in a fashion not unlike the supposed attacks of Chupacabra. However, sightings describe the attacker as resembling a cat or wolf, which led to the local legend known as the &quot;Beast of Bladenboro.&quot; In 2008, the History Channel television series &quot;Monster Quest&quot; performed an analysis concerning these attacks, which were beginning to happen again, and concluded that the attacker might have been a cougar.

=== Death of Lennon Lacy ===

In August 2014, Lennon Lacy, a student attending West Bladen High School, was found dead, hanging from the frame of a swing set in the center of a mobile home community. The death was initially declared a suicide by North Carolina&#x27;s Chief Medical Examiner, but Lacy&#x27;s family believed that he had been lynched. Lacy, who was black, had been dating a white woman, who also believed Lacy had been murdered, and who claimed neighbors had warned her that their interracial relationship was &quot;not right&quot;. In December 2014, the FBI announced it would investigate. In June 2016, the conclusion of the FBI investigation was announced, having found &quot;no evidence to pursue federal criminal civil rights charges&quot;.

Bladenboro&#x27;s downtown was heavily damaged by hurricanes Matthew and Florence.
