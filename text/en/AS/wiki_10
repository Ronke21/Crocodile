<text>University Gardens (also known as Lakeville and Little Neck, Nassau County) is a hamlet and a census-designated place (CDP) in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. It is located within the Town of North Hempstead and is part of the Greater Great Neck area. The population was 4,358 at the time of the 2020 census.

The University Gardens CDP includes the University Gardens subdivision and the other unincorporated areas between it and the Nassau / Queens line, such as Great Neck Terrace.

== History ==
Much of the land which is now located within the University Gardens CDP was once farmland. Suburban development in the community started to take off in the early 20th century. This includes development in and of the Little Neck Park, University Gardens, and Waverly Hills sections; at the time, the hamlet was known as Lakeville and Little Neck, Nassau County.

The University Gardens development (for which the hamlet and CDP is named) was developed in the late 1920s. It includes 218 homes and 17 commercial properties.

In the 1940s, large portions of the Waverly Hills section of the hamlet were developed with homes designed by architect H.C. Meyer.

In the 1950s, the 652-family Great Neck Terrace garden apartment complex within the hamlet was constructed. Located at the northwestern corner of the hamlet, the complex&#x27;s 28 garden apartment buildings were designed by architect Samuel Paul.

=== Etymology ===
The name of the University Gardens CDP is taken from a planned community of the same name, which was constructed within the hamlet in the 1920s. The name reflects the fact that the land which that subdivision is located on was purchased from (and built atop) the short-lived University Golf Club – and because Russell Gardens, located across Northern Boulevard, was being developed around the same time. As such, the &quot;University&quot; part of its name comes from the golf club and the &quot;Gardens&quot; part of its name comes from Russell Gardens.

<text>Valley Stream is a village in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population in the Village of Valley Stream was 40,634 at the time of the 2020 census.

The Incorporated Village of Valley Stream is within the Town of Hempstead, along the border with Queens, and is served by the Long Island Rail Road at the Valley Stream, Gibson, and Westwood stations.

==History==
In the year 1640, 14 years after the arrival of Dutch colonists in Manhattan (New Amsterdam), the area that is now Valley Stream was purchased by the Dutch West India Company from Rockaway Native Americans (they were a Lenape, or Delaware, band, known by the place where they lived).

With populations concentrated to the west, this woodland area was not developed for the next two centuries. The census of 1840 lists approximately 20 families, most of whom owned large farms. At that time, the northwest section was called &quot;Fosters Meadow&quot;. What is now the business section on Rockaway Avenue was called &quot;Rum Junction&quot;, because of its taverns. The racy northern section was known as &quot;Cookie Hill&quot;, and the section of the northeast that housed the local fertilizer plant was called &quot;Skunks Misery&quot;. Hungry Harbor, a section that has retained its name, was home to a squatters&#x27; community.Robert Pagan was born in Scotland on December 3, 1796. In or about the late 1830s, Robert, his wife Ellen, and their children emigrated from Scotland. On the journey to the United States, one of their children died and was buried at sea. The 1840 U.S. Census for Queens County lists Pagan&#x27;s occupation as a farmer. Two children were born to Robert and Ellen Pagan after they settled in the Town of Hempstead.

At this time, the community did not have a post office, so residents had to pick up their mail in the village of Hempstead. After Pagan petitioned authorities for a post office, he was appointed postmaster and it was based in his farmhouse, now known as the Pagan-Fletcher House. He was advised that the community needed a name. Pagan chose &quot;Valley Stream&quot; based on the topographical appearance of the area and because of the Valley Stream Brook, which runs through it. In 1843, the U.S. Post Office formally accepted the name of Valley Stream. As a consequence, Pagan is credited with naming the community. Pagan died on March 25, 1870.

His wife, Ellen, also played a significant role in early village history. Tired of traveling to Lynbrook for religious services, she began holding services in her home. A Methodist minister was hired for periodic stops at the Pagan home, and the first congregation in Valley Stream was founded.

In 1853, Hempstead Turnpike was the only road that connected Valley Stream to Jamaica and New York City. The main streets in Valley Stream that connected the small village to the turnpike were Mill Road (which is Corona Avenue today) in the west, Sand Street (Central Avenue) in the south, and Dutch Broadway in the north. That year Merrick Road, a planked, one-lane road, was constructed through Valley Stream, connecting the village to Merrick in the east and Jamaica to the west. With the new thoroughfare in the area, Valley Stream residents and industry began to move southward.

In 1869, the South Side Railroad began stopping in Valley Stream and a branch of the railroad was constructed to connect the main line with the Rockaways. The new branch is now called the Far Rockaway Branch of the Long Island Railroad.

The new railroad, combined with the emergence of Merrick Road as a major artery, stimulated growth in Valley Stream, and it became a substantial community. Around the start of the 20th century, Hendrickson Park was a prime vacationing destination for people from Brooklyn and Queens. The Valley Stream Hotel opened at the beginning of the 20th century, overlooking the golf course. Many tourists who came to visit wound up moving to Valley Stream. The Village of Valley Stream was incorporated on February 14, 1925, as a result of its growth.

In 1922, developer William R. Gibson came to Valley Stream after building more than 2,500 houses in Queens. He bought of land on Roosevelt Avenue and built homes on Avondale, Berkeley, Cambridge, Derby, and Elmwood streets. Many descendants of immigrants moved into the area. Five years later, he expanded his development to Cochran Place and Dartmouth Street. Realizing that his development was perfectly designed for white-collar commuters, he petitioned the Long Island Railroad for a stop. The LIRR agreed to stop in the area if Gibson built the station himself. On May 29, 1929, the Gibson station was opened. Gibson station, as it became known, retains the name of its founder.

On Pearl Harbor Day in 1970, a thirteen-year-old Dennis Falcone was struck by a Ford Falcon on Mill Road on his way home from school when the driver, to whom the car did not belong, lost control, mounting the sidewalk. According to Falcone, he did not notice the vehicle coming because he was distracted while adjusting his ski cap. The impact, which broke the fibula and tibia in both legs, threw Falcone approximately thirty feet through the air and into a frozen creek. The incident was witnessed by an off-duty police officer, who fished the unconscious boy from the creek. This incident put him in the hospital for seventeen days; he was discharged on Christmas Eve and spent the next six months in a wheelchair before the casts were removed and he began receiving physical therapy to return his mobility. The lawsuit was not taken to court until 1973, where a sixteen-year-old Falcone was awarded $20,000 in damages, which he later used as a down payment on his first house.

In 1984, President Ronald Reagan addressed Temple Hillel in Valley Stream at the invitation of Rabbi Morris Friedman, father of Ambassador David Friedman, which was the first time since President George Washington a sitting American President addressed a Jewish congregation at their house of worship.

<text>Wantagh ( ) is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, on Long Island, New York, United States. The population was 18,613 at the time of the 2020 census.

Wantagh is known as &quot;The Gateway to Jones Beach&quot;.

==History==

===17th century===
The Wantagh area was inhabited by the Merokee (or Merikoke) tribe of the Metoac Indians prior to the first wave of European settlement in the mid-17th century. The Merokee were part of the greater Montauk tribe that loosely ruled Long Island&#x27;s Native Americans. Wantagh was the sachem (chief) of the Merokee tribe in 1647, and was later the grand sachem of the Montauk tribe from 1651 to 1658. The Dutch settlers came east from their New Amsterdam colony, and English settlers came south from Connecticut and Massachusetts settlements. When the English and Dutch settled their competing claims to Long Island in the 1650 treaty conducted in Hartford, the Dutch partition included all lands west of Oyster Bay and thus the Wantagh area. Long Island then was ceded to the Duke of York in 1663–64, but then fell back into Dutch hands after the Dutch regained New York in 1673. The Treaty of Westminster in 1674 settled the land claims once and for all, incorporating Long Island into the now-British colony of New York.

===18th century===
Early settler accounts refer to Wantagh as &quot;Jerusalem&quot;. The creek running north–south through Wantagh, and which has been covered up in many places but is still visible between the Wantagh Parkway and the housing developments west of Wantagh Avenue, was originally the Jerusalem River. The original post office was built in 1837, for Jerusalem, but mail service from Brooklyn began around 1780. The town&#x27;s first school was established in 1790. At some time around the 1880s, Jerusalem was renamed Ridgewood, and the town&#x27;s original LIRR station was named &quot;Ridgewood Station&quot;. Later, Ridgewood was renamed Wantagh to avoid confusion with another town in New York State with the same name.

George Washington rode through Jerusalem on April 21, 1790, as part of his 5-day tour of Long Island. The Daughters of the American Revolution have placed a plaque on Hempstead Turnpike to commemorate Washington&#x27;s travels, which took him from Hempstead on Jerusalem Road (now North Jerusalem Road) to Jerusalem, on to Merrick Road. He then went on to head east, then circle back west on the north shore. During the Revolutionary War, British ships traveled up Jones inlet and came ashore to raid Jerusalem farms.

The oldest original settlers of the Wantagh/Jerusalem area were the Jackson and Seaman families, and their marks are still visible. The Cherrywood shopping center (at the corner of Jerusalem and Wantagh avenues) was the site of prominent settler Capt. John Seaman&#x27;s estate, which was named Cherrywood. Wantagh is home to a number of New York State Historical Markers (9 of Nassau County&#x27;s 25), including:

* Cherrywood, Capt. John Seaman&#x27;s estate and home, from 1644, on the corner of Wantagh and Jerusalem avenues
* 1666 Jackson House, the home of Col. John Jackson, Brig. Gen. Jacob Shearman Jackson, and Samuel Jackson Jones (in 1923), on Merrick Road east of Riverside Drive
* The Grist Mill Site, granted to Col. John Jackson on the Jerusalem River in 1704, on Merrick Road east of Riverside Drive 
* The Cornbury Patent, given by Queen Anne conferring the present-day site of Jones Beach to Major Thomas Jones, whose family would later provide the land that would become Jones Beach State Park in 1929
* The 1644 home of Robert Jackson, Jerusalem&#x27;s pioneer settler, on Wantagh Avenue south of Hempstead Avenue
* North Jerusalem Road, originally constructed in 1644 between Hempstead and Jerusalem
* The 1777 home of Richard Jackson, Captain in the Queens County Militia in the Revolutionary War, and where his daughter, Jane, lived with her husband, ex-Hessian soldier Lt. John Althause, on Wantagh Avenue and Island Road

The Samuel and Elbert Jackson House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

The oldest cemetery in Wantagh is the Jackson Cemetery, located just north of the St. Frances de Chantal Roman Catholic Church on Wantagh Avenue. There are 63 confirmed graves that include descendants from the Seaman and Jackson families, with the most notable including Thomas Jackson, who served in the Revolutionary War in the Second New York Regiment and participated in the Battle of Long Island and the storming of Fort St. George under Major Talmadge in 1780, and who was the original landowner of the site of land around the Wantagh Public Library; and General Jacob Seaman Jackson, a brigadier general in the War of 1812 and senior warden of Long Island&#x27;s first chartered Masonic lodge in 1797.

The Rierson burial plot was located in what has been redeveloped into Bunker Avenue. This cemetery includes members of the Rierson family who were Loyalists during the American Revolutionary War.

The Jerusalem Society of Friends Cemetery is located behind (east of) the current Christian Tabernacle Church. The Society of Friends were Quakers who maintained meeting houses in Jericho, Bethpage, and Hempstead, and met in then-Jerusalem as early as 1697. Capt. John Seaman allowed the Society to conduct meetings on his land in 1699, but the congregation later traveled to Bethpage to worship.

===19th century===
The Jerusalem Society of Friends purchased land from another Seaman, Arden Seaman, and then constructed their own meeting house on the site of the current Christian Tabernacle Church in 1827, and added the cemetery in 1861. By the 1940s, the congregation had dwindled significantly, and the property was sold in 1952 to the newly formed Wantagh Baptist Church and then recently sold to the newly formed Christian Tabernacle Church in 2007. The cemetery contains the graves of three Civil War veterans: Lt. H.R. Jackson, Gilbert Seaman, of the 139th Regiment of NY Volunteers, and Charles Wilson, of the 119th Regiment of NY Volunteers and who was wounded in Gettysburg.

The St. John of Jerusalem Cemetery served the German Methodists, who moved to Jerusalem from New York City around 1850 to farm. The cemetery can be found west of Wantagh Avenue a few hundred yards north of North Jerusalem Road (now North Wantagh). The congregation began to meet in 1854 and held services entirely in German. The cemetery was constructed in 1862 and was intended only for use by congregation members and their families.

===20th century===
Later generations of congregants grew weary of the services in German, and numbers dwindled until the last German service was held in 1911. From 1912 to 1926, the church remained unused. The church has since been used by a local Lutheran congregation from 1926 to 1940, and a United Christian congregation from 1949 to 1969. Since then, however, the church has remained unused, although the cemetery has been fenced in and maintained by a board of trustees. The cemetery contains graves of veterans from the Civil War, Spanish–American War, World War I, World War II, and Vietnam.

The area that became today&#x27;s Wantagh continued primarily as a farming area until the construction of Sunrise Highway and Jones Beach in the early 20th century, when tourism and fishing took hold, centering on Jones Beach. The Long Island Rail Road has served the town since 1885 and possibly as early as 1867, but the town did not take on a suburban character until the housing development between the 1950s and 1970s. The LIRR tracks were completely elevated in 1968, along with neighboring Seaford station. The Wantagh Railroad Complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

Former U.S. President Richard Nixon&#x27;s dog, Checkers, is buried at Wantagh&#x27;s Bide-a-Wee Pet Cemetery on Beltagh Avenue.

<text>West Hempstead is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 19,835 at the time of the 2020 census. It is an unincorporated area in the Town of Hempstead and is represented by Councilman Edward Ambrosino.

==History==

West Hempstead first appeared on maps as the name of a Long Island Railroad station in 1893. There are three railroad stations within its borders: West Hempstead, Hempstead Gardens, and Lakeview. The line continues to Valley Stream where it joins the Babylon Branch. Halls Pond Park, the main park within West Hempstead, was dedicated by Nassau County in 1961. The smaller Echo Park contains a public indoor pool. Its name is derived from the community&#x27;s first four little league teams: Eagles, Cardinals, Hawks, and Orioles. In 1956, the West Hempstead Public Library was founded and chartered by the State in 1967. Its present 28,000 square-foot facility was completed in 2007.

In 2001, residents of West Hempstead held a nonbinding referendum on renaming the community. The vote followed a two-year effort by the West Hempstead Civic Association and the West Hempstead Chamber of Commerce to give the community a unique name, distancing itself from the neighboring crime ridden Hempstead. By a 94-vote margin, West Hempstead retained its name over the proposed Mayfair Gardens.

West Hempstead is easily accessed from the Southern State Parkway at Exit 17N.

The West Hempstead Union Free School District currently operates 4 schools; 1 kindergarten, 1 elementary, 1 intermediate school and 1 secondary school.

The West Hempstead Fire Department (also referred to as West Hempstead FD and abbreviated as WHFD) is the main provider of Fire Protection and Emergency Medical Services within West Hempstead.

West Hempstead&#x27;s name reflects upon the fact that it is located immediately west of the Village of Hempstead.

West Hempstead lies on a gently sloping terrain between the Hempstead Plains and the Atlantic Ocean. Pine Stream runs through the center of West Hempstead, feeding into Halls Pond. The community is bordered on the east by Hempstead Lake State Park and on the south by the Southern State Parkway.

<text>The Incorporated Village of Westbury is a village in the towns of North Hempstead and Oyster Bay in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. It is located about east of Manhattan. The population was 15,404 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The first settlers arrived in 1658 in the region known as the Hempstead Plains. Many of the early settlers were Quakers.

Westbury&#x27;s Jericho Turnpike, which provides connection to Mineola and Syosset as well as to the Long Island Expressway (or LIE), was once a trail used by the Massapequa Indians. As far back as the 17th century, it served as a divider between the early homesteads north of the Turnpike and the Hempstead Plains to its south. Today, it serves as a state highway complex.

In 1657, Captain John Seaman purchased from the Algonquian Tribe of the Massapequa Indians. In 1658, Richard Stites and his family built their homestead in this area. Theirs was the only family farm until an English Quaker, Edmond Titus, and his son Samuel joined them and settled in an area of Hempstead Plains, known today as the Village of Westbury. In 1675 Henry Willis, also an English Quaker, named the area &quot;Westbury&quot;, after Westbury, Wiltshire, his hometown in England. Other Quaker families who were also seeking a place to freely express their religious beliefs joined the Tituses and Willises. The first Society of Friends meeting house was built in 1700. The early history of Westbury and that of the Friends are so interconnected that they are essentially the same.

These settlers, like many other landowners throughout the colonies, owned slaves. In 1775, compelled by their religious beliefs, the Quakers freed all 154 African-Americans that they owned. Many of these freed men and women built their own homesteads on the open land near the sheep grazing pastures. Their new community consisted of farms and dairies. In 1834, with Quaker assistance, they and their descendants built the New Light Baptist Church. In 1867 the congregation moved to 247 Grand Boulevard, and in 1892 changed their name to Westbury A.M.E. Zion Church. In 2014, the congregation celebrated its 180th anniversary. The building still stands on the corner of Union Ave. and Grand Blvd.

The outbreak of the American Revolution disrupted Westbury&#x27;s tranquility. From the beginning of the war until 1783, British soldiers and German-speaking mercenaries occupied local homes, confiscated livestock, and cleared the woods for firewood for the troops. With the close of the war, Westbury received its third group of settlers, the Hessians, mostly from Hesse-Cassel in the Holy Roman Empire, who chose not to return to their home country. Instead, they remained in an area now known as New Cassel, a name chosen in honor of the part of Hesse from which most had come.

By 1837, the Long Island Rail Road had built through Westbury. Schedules from March 1837 mention a stop at Westbury, but by June list Carle Place instead, with schedules from 1842 listing both.
In 1840, the first public school was built. The railroad made it easier for Italian and Irish immigrants to work Westbury&#x27;s farms and in 1857, St. Brigid&#x27;s Parish was founded.

At the same time more African-American families came to the area via the Underground Railroad. For some, Westbury was only one stop on the way to Canada, but several stayed in this area after being harbored in secret rooms in the homes of the Quakers. In the years after the Civil War, until near the turn of the century, the few stores that comprised the small village around the railroad depot, were mainly black owned.

The Village moved from its agricultural setting in the late 19th century when the very wealthy began to settle and build mansions. This area is now known as Old Westbury. Post Avenue soon became a commerce center to serve the surrounding estates. Various estate workers began to move in as well. Streets were mapped out and constructed. Post Avenue received electricity in 1902 and in 1914 a water company was founded.

From the 1850s to the 1900s, Westbury&#x27;s population and ethnic diversity began to rise as many people of Irish and Italian origins continued to settle. New Cassel began to be developed in the first quarter of the 20th century.

In 1927, Charles Lindbergh took off from Roosevelt Field, a couple of hundred yards south of downtown, for the history-making flight to Paris, marking probably the most famous event tied to Westbury.

In response to a rumor that northern Westbury planned to incorporate, thereby leaving the southern part without a name, residents collected enough petitions for third class incorporation in 1932. The Village included Grantsville, the section south of Union Avenue around A.M.E. Zion church, but did not take in New Cassel, since the few families that lived there thought it would only unnecessarily increase their taxes.

In 1938, the Northern State Parkway was constructed and in 1940, Roosevelt Raceway. In 1941, the Second World War began. Westbury sent 1,400 persons to serve the country. This was 20% of the community&#x27;s population, making it the highest percentage of any comparable community in the United States.

In the mid-1950s, Westbury virtually ran out of undeveloped land and with it came the end of the building boom. In 1940, Westbury listed its population at 4,525. By 1960, Westbury&#x27;s population had grown to 14,757, according to the census data for that year. Many Caribbean and Latin American families began to settle during this time and in the decades that followed.

On September 8, 1974, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash performed at the Roosevelt Raceway.

A great number still reside on the Hill across from Saint Brigid&#x27;s Church.

<text>Niagara Falls is a city in Niagara County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 48,671. It is adjacent to the Niagara River, across from the city of Niagara Falls, Ontario, and named after the famed Niagara Falls which they share. The city is within the Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area and the Western New York region.

While the city was formerly inhabited by Native Americans, Europeans who migrated to the Niagara Falls in the mid-17th century began to open businesses and develop infrastructure. Later in the 18th and 19th centuries, scientists and businessmen began harnessing the power of the Niagara River for electricity and the city began to attract manufacturers and other businesses drawn by the promise of inexpensive hydroelectric power. After the 1960s, however, the city and region experienced an economic decline. As industries left the region, affluent and middle-class families relocated from Niagara Falls to other metropolitan areas around the country.

Due to the loss of jobs in the region, especially in the manufacturing sector, the city has gone from over 102,000 residents in 1960 to approximately 48,000 residents in 2020, a population drop of more than 50%.

==History==
Before Europeans entered the area, it was dominated by the Neutral Nation of Native Americans. European migration into the area began in the 17th century. The first recorded European to visit the area was Frenchman Robert de la Salle, who built Fort Conti at the mouth of the Niagara River early in 1679, with permission from the Iroquois, as a base for boatbuilding; his ship &quot;Le Griffon&quot; was built on the upper Niagara River at or near Cayuga Creek in the same year. He was accompanied by Belgian priest Louis Hennepin, who was the first known European to see the falls. The influx of newcomers may have been a catalyst for already hostile native tribes to turn to open warfare in competition for the fur trade.

The City of Niagara Falls was incorporated on March 17, 1892, from the villages of Manchester and Suspension Bridge, which were parts of the Town of Niagara. Thomas Vincent Welch, a member of the charter committee and a New York state assemblyman and a second-generation Irish American, persuaded Governor Roswell P. Flower to sign the bill on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. George W. Wright was elected the first mayor of Niagara Falls.

By the end of the 19th century, the city was heavily industrialized, due in part to the power potential offered by the Niagara River. Tourism was considered a secondary niche, while manufacturing of petrochemicals, abrasives, metallurgical products and other materials was the main producer of jobs and attracted a large number of workers, many of whom were immigrants.
In 1927, the city annexed the village of La Salle, named for Robert de la Salle, from the Town of Niagara.

Industry and tourism grew steadily throughout the first half of the 20th century due to a high demand for industrial products and the increased mobility of people to travel. Paper, rubber, plastics, petrochemicals, carbon insulators and abrasives were among the city&#x27;s major industries. This prosperity would end by the late 1960s as aging industrial plants moved to less expensive locations. In addition, the falls were incompatible with modern shipping technology.

In 1956, the Schoellkopf Power Plant on the lower river just downstream of the American Falls was critically damaged by the collapse of the Niagara Gorge wall above it. This prompted the planning and construction of one of the largest hydroelectric plants to be built in North America to that time, generating a large influx of workers and families to the area. New York City urban planner Robert Moses built the new power plant in nearby Lewiston, New York. Much of the power generated there fueled growing demands for power in downstate New York and New York City.

The neighborhood of Love Canal gained national media attention in 1978 when toxic waste contamination from a chemical landfill beneath it forced United States President Jimmy Carter to declare a state of emergency, the first such presidential declaration made for a non-natural disaster. Hundreds of residents were evacuated from the area, many of whom were ill because of exposure to chemical waste.
After the Love Canal disaster, the city—which had already been declining in population for nearly two decades—experienced accelerated economic and political difficulties. The costs of manufacturing elsewhere had become less expensive, which led to the closure of several factories. The city&#x27;s population eventually dropped by more than half of its peak, as workers fled the city in search of jobs elsewhere. Then, much like the nearby city of Buffalo, the city&#x27;s economy plummeted when a failed urban renewal project destroyed Falls Street and the tourist district.

In 2001, the leadership of Laborers Local 91 was found guilty of extortion, racketeering and other crimes following an exposé by Mike Hudson of the &quot;Niagara Falls Reporter&quot;. Union boss Michael &quot;Butch&quot; Quarcini died before trial, while the rest of the union leadership was sentenced to prison.

In early 2010, former Niagara Falls Mayor Vincenzo Anello was indicted on federal charges of corruption, alleging the mayor accepted $40,000 in loans from a businessman who was later awarded a no-bid lease on city property. The charges were dropped as part of a plea deal after Anello pleaded guilty to unrelated charges of pension fraud, regarding a pension from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, of which he is a member. He was sentenced to 10 to 16 months in prison.

The city&#x27;s decline received national exposure from Bloomberg Businessweek in 2010.

On November 30, 2010, the New York State Attorney General entered into an agreement with the city and its police department to create new policies to govern police practices in response to claims of excessive force and police misconduct. The city committed to create policies and procedures to prevent and respond to allegations of excessive force, and to ensure police are properly trained and complaints are properly investigated. Prior claims filed by residents will be evaluated by an independent panel.

In 2020, a public square named Cataract Commons opened on Old Falls Street. It is a public space for outdoor events and activities.

The city has multiple properties on the National Register of Historic Places. It also has three national historic districts, including Chilton Avenue-Orchard Parkway Historic District, Deveaux School Historic District and the Park Place Historic District.

In response to gun violence, volunteer groups such as Operation SNUG mobilized to promote positive community involvement in the troubled areas of the city.

==Economy==

Niagara Falls&#x27; main industry is tourism, driven primarily by the waterfalls.

A 2012 profile from the Office of the New York State Comptroller reported that Niagara Falls has &quot;struggled through decades of population losses, rising crime and repeated attempts to reinvent itself from a manufacturing town with some tourism to a major tourist destination.&quot; The city became a boomtown with the opening of the New York State Power Authority&#x27;s hydroelectric Niagara Power Plant in the 1960s; the cheap electricity produced by the plant generated power for a burgeoning manufacturing industry. Along with the rest of Western New York, Niagara Falls suffered a significant economic decline from a decline in industry by the 1970s. Today, the city struggles to compete with Niagara Falls, Ontario; the Canadian side has a greater average annual income, a higher average home price, and lower levels of vacant buildings and blight, as well as a more vibrant economy and better tourism infrastructure. The population of Niagara Falls, New York fell by half from the 1960s to 2012. In contrast, the population of Niagara Falls, Ontario more than tripled. In 2000, the city&#x27;s median household income was 36% below the national average. In 2012, the city&#x27;s unemployment rate was significantly higher than the statewide unemployment rate.

Significant sources of economic activity in the region includes the Niagara Falls International Airport, which was renovated in 2009; the Seneca Gaming Corporation&#x27;s Seneca Niagara Casino &amp; Hotel, which opened in the 2000s respectively; and the nearby Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station.

In late 2001, the State of New York established the USA Niagara Development Corporation, a subsidiary to the State&#x27;s economic development agency, to focus specifically on facilitating development in the downtown area. However, the organization has been criticized for making little progress and doing little to improve the city&#x27;s economy.

===Convention Center===

From 1973 to 2002, the city had a Convention and Civic Center on 4th street. In 2002 the venue was converted into the Seneca Niagara Casino &amp; Hotel. In 2004, a new Niagara Falls Convention Center (NFCC) opened on Old Falls Street. The Old Falls Street venue has 116,000 square feet for exhibitions and meetings, and a 32,200-square-foot event/exhibit hall.

===Tourism===

The city is home to the Niagara Falls State Park. The park has several attractions, including Cave of the Winds behind the Bridal Veil Falls, Maid of the Mist, a popular boat tour which operates at the foot of the Rainbow Bridge, Prospect Point and its observation tower, Niagara Discovery Center, Niagara Falls Underground Railroad Heritage Center, and the Aquarium of Niagara.

Several other attractions also near the river, including Whirlpool State Park, De Veaux Woods State Park, Earl W. Brydges Artpark State Park in nearby Lewiston (town), New York, and Fort Niagara State Park in Youngstown, New York.

<doc id="126821" wikidata="Q1378018" url="?curid=126821" title="North Tonawanda, New York">
<text>North Tonawanda is a city in Niagara County, New York, United States. The population was 31,568 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Buffalo–Niagara Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city is named after Tonawanda Creek, its south border.

Tonawanda in the Seneca language means &quot;Swift Running Water&quot;. Tonawanda Creek, which flows into the Niagara River, once had large stretches of rapids (see Rapids, New York) until it was tamed with the construction of the Erie Canal.

The city also calls itself &quot;The Lumber City,&quot; due to its past primary industry and once was the largest port on the Great Lakes during the height of the Erie Canal. Along Goundry Street are mansions built for the lumber barons, including 208 Goundry Street, called &quot;Kent Place&quot;, designed by Stanford White. Many of the local residents refer to the city as &quot;The Jewel of Niagara County&quot; due to its geographical setting between the Niagara River and Erie Canal. Street signs on the borders of town welcome visitors to &quot;The Home Of The Carousel&quot;.

==History==
After the first settlers arrived in 1809, North Tonawanda became part of the town of Wheatfield, New York in Niagara County, from May 1836. An abortive attempt at a village containing portions in two counties and two towns from January 1854 until April 1857, it was part of the Niagara County/Town of Wheatfield component, with the other portion in Erie County and the Town of Tonawanda. The experiment was abandoned after New York State removed the village&#x27;s North Tonawanda component. Oral history claims a dispute between merchants was the cause, but the combination of communities in two counties and two towns was unwieldy. After becoming a village on May 8, 1865 (still in the Town of Wheatfield, but as part of Martinsville, New York), North Tonawanda was incorporated as a City on April 24, 1897.

North Tonawanda is on the north side of the Erie Canal/Tonawanda Creek, across from Erie County, New York and the communities of the City of Tonawanda and the Town of Amherst. The Town of Wheatfield borders North Tonawanda on the north and east; the Niagara River serves as its western border, as Tonawanda Creek is its southern border. North Tonawanda is the second largest city in Niagara County, after Niagara Falls, New York.

North Tonawanda is known as &quot;The Lumber City,&quot; because it was from the mid-19th century through the 1970s, a lumber transportation and forwarding center of significance because of the ready availability of lumber. It was the birthplace of the Herschell-Spillman Company/Allan Herschell Co., one of the leading manufacturers of carousels in America and is now the home of the Herschell Carrousel Factory Museum. In 1888, Herschell attracted expatriate Belgian Eugene de Kleist to North Tonawanda, who started the North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory to produce band organs. Taken over in 1909 by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company after De Kleist became mayor of North Tonawanda in 1906, Wurlitzer became one of the largest musical instrument manufacturing plants in the world. The Ray H. Bennett Lumber Co., one of more than 150 lumber companies to have called North Tonawanda home, produced kit homes sold around the nation and Canada for 70 years. Richardson Boat, Buffalo Bolt, Durez Chemical, National Grinding Wheel, Taylor Devices, International Paper, Tonawanda Iron &amp; Steel, Riverside Chemical, and hundreds of other successful manufacturing businesses called North Tonawanda home.

The Railroad Museum of the Niagara Frontier occupies a 1923 Erie Railroad station on Oliver Street. The Riviera Theater and Performing Arts Center on Webster Street, in a restored Italian Renaissance-style building, features plays, concerts, movies and other events, and its 1926 &quot;Mighty Wurlitzer&quot; organ is featured in monthly organ concerts. The theater is one of only a handful in the United States with projectors capable of showing nitrate film prints in common use before about 1951. The Ghostlight Theatre is a community theater in a century-old church. The former Carnegie Library is home to the Carnegie Art Center. An E. B. Green designed building houses the Buffalo Suzuki Strings Musical Arts Center. An active arts community has developed in the downtown area as well. The North Tonawanda History Museum no longer occupies the former G. C. Murphy Co. store building on Webster Street in the heart of the Downtown Historic District.

Parks in North Tonawanda include Veteran&#x27;s Park, which has a monument to U.S. Seabees, one to the U.S. Marines, and is working on one to Vietnam War Veterans; Gateway Harbor Park, along the Erie Canal, the site of the annual Canal Fest in July and free concerts and other activities; the Gratwick-Riverside Park along the Niagara River; and Pine Woods Park, Mayor&#x27;s Park, and the North Tonawanda Botanical Gardens with a boat launch.

The Buffalo Norsemen played their home games in North Tonawanda during their existence.

==Geography==
North Tonawanda is located at (43.041006, -78.868920).

The Erie Canal defines the southern and the majority of the eastern borders of the city, with the rest of the eastern border made up of Sweeney Street and Old Falls Boulevard. Niagara Falls Boulevard (US Route 62) defines the northeastern border of the city. The majority of the northern border of the city is a line that runs east-west just above Forbes Terrace, mostly paralleling Ruie Road, with the rest of the northern border being a short northwesterly line that runs from Ward Road to Witmer Road. The western edge of the city is defined by the Niagara River and a line that runs just west of and parallel to Witmer Road. Also, at the southwest corner of the city is Tonawanda Island, which is separated from the mainland by the Little River (Part of the East Branch of the Niagara River) and is part of the city.

The edge of North Tonawanda is sometimes hard to find, because the southern parts of both the Towns of Wheatfield and Pendleton use the same zip code as North Tonawanda, 14120.

<text>Olcott is a hamlet (and census-designated place) located in the Town of Newfane in Niagara County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census, this community population was 1,241. Most locals refer to it as Olcott Beach. It is part of the Buffalo–Niagara Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Olcott is a lakeside community which is home to the deepest harbor on Lake Ontario west of Rochester. The community is at the junction of East/West Lake Road (NYS Route 18) and Lockport-Olcott Road (NYS Route 78).

Many of these attractions have closed, however, after the decline of the City of Niagara Falls and a prolonged economic downturn which has hard hit all of Niagara County. Slowly, efforts are being made to bring back this economic prosperity that the region once saw, and so far has been a success in Olcott. Heritage tourism has become quite popular in Niagara County, and new festivals include the &quot;Olcott Pirate Festival&quot; as well as a famous car show that takes place during the summer.

In 2012, Olcott Beach won the prestigious title of Ultimate Fishing Town in a contest sponsored by The World Fishing Network (WFN). Olcott Beach enjoys a superior reputation as a world-class fishing destination by sportsmen and hobbyists alike.

Expansion of the schools has taken place in recent years to accommodate an increase of school population.

Up until recently, Pendleton has been primarily an agricultural community. It now is rezoning much of its land area for residential subdivisions and business. The population of Pendleton continues to grow as more residential development takes place.

Pendleton has an all-volunteer fire company serviced by Wendelville Fire company.

In March 2010, Sir Benjamin Ruppert, Esq., of the Western New York Residency Evaluation Committee, nominated Pendleton for &quot;Best Place to Grow Up in America.&quot;

For thousands of years, the area was inhabited by various cultures of indigenous peoples. At the time of European encounter, this was the territory of the powerful Iroquois Confederacy, based in present-day New York state.

Permanent European-American settlement did not take place until after the American Revolution, about 1801, after most of the Iroquois had been forced to cede their lands to New York and had emigrated across the Niagara River to Upper Canada.

The Town of Porter was created in 1812 from the Town of Cambria, but further development was hindered by the War of 1812. The United States&#x27; war with Great Britain first included an embargo of trade with Canada, disrupting the local economy. Warfare along the border continued until 1814.

==Geography==
Ransomville is located at (43.236955, -78.915327).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

== History ==

===Founding===
The town of Ransomville was established in 1842 by the Ransom and Curtiss families and was named after William Henry Harrison Ransom. The Curtiss family, led by brothers Gideon and Capt. Gilbert Curtiss, were the first to settle in the area in the 1820s, establishing the early links with neighboring towns.

The son of immigrants from Sullivan County in the Hudson River Valley, W.H.H. Ransom arrived in Niagara County in 1839 and built a farm that he worked with his wife, Elisa Estes Ransom. In 1846, Ransom purchased a general store from his uncle, Jehiel Ransom, who had been in Niagara County since 1826 and served as postmaster. Ransom had 13 children and died at the age of 74 in Ransomville on December 29, 1889.

===Development===

Ransomville was established as a farming community, but some of the earliest businesses were the log taverns built by Gideon Curtiss, the first of which was erected in 1817 and the second in 1825. A cemetery was laid out by 1821. In 1840 the Ransomville House was built as a larger, more refined building. In addition to the hotel, an 1860 map of the village lists two doctors and two blacksmiths, as well as a bootmaker, carriage maker, harness maker, grocer, lumber mill and general merchandise store.

Early settlers from the Curtiss family cleared and laid down the roads from Ransomville to Youngstown to the West (NY 93), along the ridge to the South (NY 104) and Lake Ontario to the North (CR 17). In 1876, The Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad took over the Lake Ontario Shore Railroad and extended track, connecting Ransomville with Lewiston to the West and Syracuse to the East. This was later incorporated into the New York Central Railroad. A year later, Gilbert Curtiss built the Excelsior Elevator across from the rail depot. The Curtisses&#x27; agricultural business would grow to include a poultry farm that was considered the largest in the nation by the early 20th century.

In the 20th century, the town&#x27;s claim to poultry fame faded with the development of new techniques and the opening of larger facilities.

<text>Wheatfield is a town in Niagara County, New York, United States. The population was 18,117 at the 2010 census. The name stems from the agricultural use of the town lands, the growing of wheat.

The Town of Wheatfield is east of Niagara Falls International Airport.

==History==

The Town of Wheatfield was formed in 1836 from the Town of Niagara. It is situated in the southwest part of the county, surrounded by the towns of Lewiston and Cambria to the north, Pendleton to the east, the City of North Tonawanda and the Niagara River to the south, and the City of Niagara Falls and Town of Niagara to the west.

The earliest known settler on the site of present-day Martinsville in North Tonawanda was George N. Burger, who came in 1809, built a log tavern on the river, and remained a resident until about 1825. Joshua Pettit came in 1810 and settled near the Niagara Iron Works, where he opened a tavern. He was the father of Mrs. Daniel C. Jacobs and Mrs. Whitman Jacobs. Stephen Jacobs, a soldier at the Battle of Bunker Hill, located on the river two miles (3 km) below in 1817, where he purchased of Augustus Porter, paying eight dollars an acre. He died in Niagara Falls in January 1840. William Vandervoorte settled here in 1825, occupying a log house which tradition says was the only one then in existence.

It was his intention to make a business of purchasing staves and timber for the Boston market, and ultimately to open a mercantile business. In 1828, he finished the first public house in the place, which was called the Niagara; it was burned in 1844. Later he purchased of land of the Holland Company and sold to Prussian immigrants the largest part of their possessions on Tonawanda Creek and its vicinity. He established the first bank in 1836. As before indicated, little progress of a business nature was made here until the opening of the Erie Canal. The interior of the town was still almost an unbroken wilderness and, as late as 1850, a large part of the area of the town was unimproved.

The first town meeting was held on June 6, 1836, in the schoolhouse of District No. 7, on the north line of the town. The soil of the town, clay loam, is very good for wheat crops in particular, and leads to the origin of the name Wheatfield.

Starting in 1843, German immigrants in the region established the communities of Bergholz (called at first &quot;Neu Bergholz&quot; and named for an existing village in the Ukermark region of eastern Germany), St. Johnsburg (originally known as &quot;Little Bergholz&quot;), Walmore (first known as &quot;Walmow&quot; and originally acquired from a Mennonite community), Martinsville, and Gratwick. The latter two towns are now part of North Tonawanda. Later, other communities were formed at railroad stops and along major highways.

In the 1920s, the River Road section of the Town became a prosperous farm area, including the showplace &quot;Wheatfield Farms&quot;. Vacation cottages, beaches, an amusement park, and nightclubs were all constructed along the river. Permanent housing has since replaced most of these, but some remnants are still visible along River Road.

During World War II, industries located in the Town. The largest was Bell Aircraft (later Bell Aerospace) founded by Larry Bell which produced, for example, the World War II fighter plane, P-39 Airacobra. One Russian-leased example of this aircraft is on display at the Niagara Aerospace Museum. 10% of all aircraft production by the United States was produced in Western New York and by Bell in particular. Later, the company made products for the aerospace industry. This included aspects of the Apollo Program such as the Apollo Lunar Module propulsion system. With the closure of the facility in 1990, the vast plant was repurposed as a mixed-business complex, including a branch of the Lockheed Martin company.

During the postwar period, other industries and businesses were established in the town, including those serving the tourist trade such as motels and restaurants. The largest included Carborundum, Demler Cider Mill, Sawyer Creek Hotel, Loblaws grocery stores, assorted businesses and light manufacturing industries along Liberty Drive, and Thiele&#x27;s dairy and bakery (defunct as of 1989), and plant nursery/agricultural supply company, which still exists to this day. The Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station is a major employer of the Town and of Niagara County, as is the Summit Medical Campus (in association with the Memorial Medical Center in Niagara Falls) which hosts the Summit Family Health Center among other specialist outlets.

Growth and prosperity in the town continued, as families migrated from nearby communities creating new neighborhoods. During this period, Summit Park Mall was built, opening in 1972 to serve the people of Wheatfield and nearby communities. The property closed as a mall by 2008 and is being redeveloped.

The largest spurt of growth in the town began in the 1980s and still continues today with many new housing developments emerging and new industrial and business parks being built. The population of the town now exceeds 18,000, which classifies it as a town of the first class, according to standard municipal classifications.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and 2.41% is water.

The Niagara River is part of the western border of the town.

<text>Youngstown is a village in Niagara County, New York, United States. The population was 1,935 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Buffalo–Niagara Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Youngstown is on the western edge of the town of Porter and is at the international border with Canada, at Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. It is north of the city of Niagara Falls.

== History ==
The village&#x27;s early growth was under the protection of Fort Niagara.
The village was destroyed by the British in 1813 during the War of 1812.
The Village of Youngstown was incorporated in 1854, named after John Young.

Youngstown is an historic village located at the northwestern corner of the state where the Niagara River flows into Lake Ontario.
In an area known to the Indians for hundreds of years, the French explorer La Salle left his mark by building a small fort in 1670, less than a mile north of where the village now stands. The French gained control of the Great Lakes area and by 1727 built the &quot;Castle&quot; which became the centerpiece of Old Fort Niagara.

John Young, who lived across the river, saw opportunities on this side and built a store on the landing area in 1809. In 1811, he bought Lots 1 and 2 of the Mile Reserve. These included all the property from what is now the north side of Falkner Park and as far south as Campbell Street and from the river eastward to what is now the Niagara Scenic Parkway.

Young sold the Falkner Park area to Robert Greensit in March 1812 before the war started between the U.S. and England. By that time, a number of log cabins had been built to provide shelter for the skilled tradesmen and storekeepers who were attracted to the area by the Fort which needed many supplies and services.

In 1813, American forces captured Fort George across the river. At Christmas time, they retreated to the American side after burning the Village of Newark, Ontario (now Niagara-On-The-Lake). In retaliation, British and Indians captured Fort Niagara and burned most of the buildings and homes south of it to what is now Buffalo.

Rebuilding gradually took place and by the 1840s the village was well established with many fine homes and stores. The moderate climate, the excellent fishing, accessibility by lake boats and proximity to Canada all played a part in Youngstown&#x27;s growth. The soil proved invaluable for fruit culture which attracted many farmers. This led to the development of industries such as barrel making, fruit packing and storage, the drying of apples and making of cider and vinegar. Carpenters, blacksmiths and other tradesmen were needed as lumber and shipbuilding businesses were important for many years.

Many changes have come about through the years: concrete sidewalks replaced those made of wood. The dirt and stone road to Lewiston became a safe paved highway; the fire company grew from a man-pulled hose cart into a fully equipped fire department and water and sewer systems were installed throughout the village. The handling of mail began in Judge Hinman&#x27;s home and was finally delivered house to house in 1959.

Three railroads were built to the village. Two failed immediately in the 1850s, but the electric line carried supplies to the village and fort as well as bringing thousands of people to the old beach amusement park.

The following are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Fort Niagara Light, John Carter Farmstead, St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, and the Old Fort Niagara-Colonial Niagara Historic District.

=== Old Fort Niagara ===
Old Fort Niagara is a National Historic Landmark and New York State Historic Site that welcomes more than 100,000 visitors every year. It offers a collection of original military architecture and fortifications from the 18th century and the 19th century, as well as living history events and programs, historical exhibits and collections, archaeology, and education.

The history of Old Fort Niagara spans more than 300 years. During the colonial wars in North America a fort at the mouth of the Niagara River was vital, for it controlled access to the Great Lakes and the westward route to the heartland of the continent. With the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, however, the strategic value of Fort Niagara diminished. It nonetheless remained an active military post well into the 20th century.

The three flags flown daily above the parade ground symbolize the nations which have held Fort Niagara. Each competed for the support of a fourth nation; the powerful Iroquois Confederacy. The French established the first post here, Fort Conti, in 1679. Its successor, Fort Denonville (1687–88) was equally short lived. In 1726 France finally erected a permanent fortification with the construction of the impressive &quot;French Castle.&quot; Britain gained control of Fort Niagara in 1759, during the French &amp; Indian War, after a nineteen-day siege. The British held the post throughout the American Revolution but were forced, by treaty, to yield it to the United States in 1796. Fort Niagara was recaptured by the British in 1813. It was ceded to the United States a second time in 1815 at the end of the War of 1812.

<text>Annsville is a town in Oneida County, New York, United States. At the 2010 census the town population was 3,012. The town is named after Ann Bloomfield, wife of a founder.

The Town of Annsville is in the northwestern part of the county.

==History==
Annsville was settled in April 1793 when John W. Bloomfield moved from Burlington, New Jersey to what is now the hamlet of Taberg, and erected a saw mill and a grist mill.

===Land===
Annsville&#x27;s territory is land first acquired by John and Nicholas Roosevelt in 1791 from the New York State Land Commission. This patent was for 530,000 acres situated in present Oswego and Oneida counties. Approximately 499,000 acres of the Roosevelt Tract became &quot;Scriba’s Patent&quot; in 1793 as partial payment of debts owed to the Scriba Bank by the Roosevelts. The land was divided into Townships at this time. Annsville contains portions of towns 1,2,3, and 8.

===Early settlers===

<text>Augusta is a town in Oneida County, New York, United States. The population was 2,021 at the 2020 census.

The Town of Augusta is in the southwestern part of Oneida County.

== History ==
Augusta was settled in 1793 by a man named Gunn, whose son, Peter Smith Gunn, was the first child born in the town.

===Other early settlers=== 
Gunn was followed by Benjamin Warren, David Morton, and John Alden. On August 17, 1793, Ichabod Stafford, and Joseph and Abraham Forbes arrived bringing the population to 23. Other settlers arriving in 1794 and 1795 were Isaac and Benjamin Allen, Amos Parker, a Revolutionary War veteran, James Cassety, Frances O&#x27;Toole, Ozias Hart, Abel Prior, Thomas Spafford, Ezra Saxton, Abiel Lindsley, and J. Reynolds.

1796 brought Abraham and Alexander Holmes, Oliver Bartholomew, Deacon Philip Pond, William Martin, Stephen Crosby, Archibald and John Manchester, Robert Worden, and John Goodhue.

Several families arrived in 1797, all from Washington, Connecticut. These were Robert Durkee, Newton Smith, Joseph Hurd, Sheldon Parmalee, Benhamin and Joseph Durkee, and David Curtis.

Andrew McMillan arrived from North Conway, New Hampshire, in 1798. McMillan&#x27;s son, also named Andrew McMillan, became superintendent of the Utica Schools. The first merchant, named Adams, opened in 1798.

Josiah Cook came from Otis, Massachusetts, in 1799. The area in which he settled was called &quot;Cook&#x27;s Corners&quot;. Several other settlers arrived from an adjacent town, Blandford including Abner Ranney, Elisha Shepard, and many belonging to the Knox family. Cook&#x27;s Corners was later renamed Knox&#x27;s Corners then Knoxboro.

Another early settler was Charles Putnam, from Stonington, Connecticut, having first lived in Clinton for two years. He is also a Revolutionary War veteran and is credited with building the first timber frame barn in the town, built of black ash.

===Land===
The town is made up of land of:
*The Peter Smith tract (later called the New Petersburgh Patent), an Indian lease of 60,000 acres in 1794. Smith sub-divided his tract and leased the land to settlers.
*Part of the approximately 4,000 acre Stockbridge Indian reservation (later called the Stockbridge Patent)
*a small portion of the &quot;Chenango Twenty Towns&quot; (or the &quot;Governor&#x27;s Purchase&quot;), purchased via treaty from the Six Nations in 1788
*a portion of the &quot;Oneida Reservation&quot;, a tract sold by the Oneida Indians to New York State in 1795 and auctioned by the state in 1797.

===Civic formation===

The first attempt to organize the town was in 1797. A bill was considered in the New York State Legislature and passed the Assembly, but failed in the Senate because Senator Samuel Jones noted that town officers must be freeholders and many of the prospective town officials were lessees of Peter Smith&#x27;s land. Organization was successful the next year and Augusta was created as a town simultaneously with the creation of Oneida County on March 15, 1798. It was created from part of the town of Whitestown.

The first town meeting was held on April 3, 1798. The following positions were filled: town supervisor, town clerk, assessors (4), commissioner of highways (3), overseers of the poor (2), constable and collector, inspectors of schools (3), fence viewers (3).

Part of the town was taken to form part of the new town of Vernon on February 17, 1802.

===Name===

The act that created the town specified it would be called Augusta to honor General Augustus Van Horn. This was arranged by Thomas Cassety, son of James Cassety and a Colonel in the militia, in exchange for a new military hat from Van Horn.

===Commerce===

James Cassety built a saw mill in 1794 and the first grist-mill in 1796, which was destroyed by flooding around 1807. A second mill was built by David Currie and had an adjacent saw-mill, both powered by the water of Oriskany Creek. A tannery and currier was built by Aaron Burley in 1816. The building was subsequently used as a grist-mill, distillery, and later a wool factory. A hotel was built around 1836 by John Stebbins. A foundry and machine-shop was built in 1853 that manufactured various machines and implements. A later grist-mill was built by Martin Miller in 1861–62. A yarn factory was built in 1865.

A plank road was constructed through Oriskany Falls connecting Deansville (now Deansboro) and Hamilton in June 1848 by the Hamilton and Deansville Plank Road Company. It was abandoned in 1874.

A plank road was constructed through Augusta connecting Rome and Madison by the Rome and Madison Plank Road Company in April 1850.

The Chenango Canal, connecting the Erie Canal in Utica with the Susquehanna River at Binghamton was constructed from July 1834 to October 1836 and passed through a corner of Augusta. It was an important means of transporting coal from Pennsylvania but ceased operation in 1878 and was abandoned after rail transport became dominate.

The railroad reached Augusta in the late 1860s with the construction of the Utica, Clinton and Binghamton Railroad with a station in the Oriskany Falls, a village in southeast Augusta, on the line from Utica to the New York, Ontario and Western Railway.

The economy of the town was largely based upon agriculture, the small industry centered around the village of Oriskany Falls, and the quarrying of lime and limestone which was in abundant supply and exported around the country.

===Assemblymen from Augusta===

The following people from Augusta represented Oneida County in the New York State Assembly.

*David I. Ambler - 40th New York State Legislature, 1816–17
*Winthrop H. Chandler - 50th New York State Legislature, 1827

<text>Ava is a town in Oneida County, New York, United States. The population was 680 at the 2020 census.

The Town of Ava is in the north central part of the county. Ava is north of the city of Rome.

==History==
Ava was formed from Boonville on May 12, 1846. It was the second to last town to be created in the county, followed only by Forestport in 1869.

===Early settlers=== 
Ava was settled in 1798 by Ebenezer Harger, who two years prior moved to Whitestown from Connecticut. The next settlers were Zephaniah and Abner Wood. Isaac Knight arrived from Rhode Island in 1798 or 1799. Around 1800, Philo Harger, Benjamin Jones, Lemuel Wood, Justus Beardsley and Salmon Bates (who opened the town&#x27;s first tavern in his house) arrived. Daniel Buck, an American Revolutionary War veteran arrived from Massachusetts in 1800. Other early settlers were Rickerson Kenyon, Joseph Hunt, Remember Kent, who built an early saw-mill, and Bates, Barnard, Fanning, Adams, Beck, Tiffany.

The first child born in Ava was Chauncey Harger in March 1801. The first saw-mill was built in 1801 by Philo Harger and Benjamin Jones.

===Land===
The town is made up of land of:

*Adgate patent, a 45,000 acre patent issued to Matthew Adgate. Adgate was a member of the NY assembly and the US constitutional convention.
*the Oothoudt Patent, a 16,052 acre patent issued to Henry Oothoudt in 1786 (about one have of Ava lies within this patent). Oothoudt was a delegate to the New York Provincial Congress in 1775 and 1776, Albany County assemblyman in the 3rd New York State Legislature, 1779–1780, one of three commissioners of forfeitures under the New York Act of Attainder which seized the property of loyalists, and delegate to the US constitutional convention.
*the Gore Patent, a 15,360 acre patent issued to Thomas Machin in 1787 (one of the several Machin Patents). Machin was an engineer and surveyor and used his skills in support of the American Revolutionary War.
*the Scriba Patent, land first acquired by John and Nicholas Roosevelt in 1791 from the New York State Land Commission. This patent was for 530,000 acres situated in present Oswego and Oneida counties. Approximately 499,000 acres of the Roosevelt Tract became Scriba&#x27;s Patent in 1793 as partial payment of debts owed to the Scriba Bank by the Roosevelts.
*the Franklin and Robinson Tract (also called the Quaker Tract), a 75,000 acre parcel purchased from George Scriba in 1795.
*the Muller Tract, a 1615-acre previously part of the Franklin and Robinson Tract that whose mortgage was foreclosed upon by Rembrandt Muller.

===Civic formation===

Ava was created by the legislature on May 12, 1846. The first town meeting was held on May 26, 1846. The following positions were filled: Town Supervisor, Town Clerk, Justices of the Peace (4), Assessors (3), Commissioner of Highways (3), Overseers of the Poor (2), Collector, Constables (4), Superintendent of Schools (1), Sealer of Weights and Measures.

===Name===

Ava was named after the Kingdom of Ava.

===Commerce===
An early road connecting Fort Stanwix to Carthage passed through the town. It was known as the old &quot;French Road&quot; from the time that Carthage was a French settlement on the Black River.

A plank road was constructed through Ava connecting Rome and Turin by the Rome and Turin Plank-Road Company in 1848. It was abandoned in 1855.

The area was primarily agricultural before becoming more dependent on dairying in the second half of the 19th century, when six cheese factories were located in Ava.

<doc id="126838" wikidata="Q1021657" url="?curid=126838" title="Clinton, Oneida County, New York">
<text>Clinton (or Ka-dah-wis-dag, &quot;white field&quot; in Seneca language) is a village in Oneida County, New York, United States. The population was 1,942 at the 2010 census, declining to 1,683 in the 2020 census, 13% decline). It was named for George Clinton, the first Governor of New York.

The village of Clinton is within the town of Kirkland. Clinton was known as the &quot;village of schools&quot; due to the large number of private schools operating in the village during the 19th century. Hamilton College is in proximity to the village.

In describing the attractions of Hamilton College in 1833, it was stated to be &quot;situated in one of the most healthful, delightful, and fertile parts of our country; surrounded by a numerous, increasing, virtuous, and enterprising population.&quot; In 1903, another school catalogue, besides &quot;the unrivalled beauty of the surrounding scenery&quot; and &quot;the remarkable healthfulness of the vicinity,&quot; commented on &quot;the high moral fiber of the community and its superior educational advantages&quot;, all of which made Clinton &quot;a most highly favored place for mental and moral culture.&quot;

== History ==
Part of Coxe&#x27;s Patent, 6th division, Clinton began in March 1787 when Revolutionary War veterans from Plymouth, Connecticut, settled in Clinton. Pioneer brought seven other families with him to the area. The new inhabitants found good soil, plentiful forests, and friendly in southern Kirkland along with Oneida people, who passed through on trail.
Named after New York&#x27;s first governor, George Clinton, fourth Vice President of the United States and an uncle of Erie Canal builder and New York governor DeWitt Clinton, the village had a gristmill on the Oriskany Creek on College Street the first year and slowly developed as a farming and mercantile center.

In 1793, Presbyterian minister Rev. Samuel Kirkland founded Hamilton-Oneida Academy as a seminary to serve as part of his missionary work with the Oneida tribe. The seminary admitted both white and Oneida boys, although no Oneida boys lasted more than one year.
Kirkland named it in honor of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, who was a member of the first Board of Trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy. The Academy became Hamilton College in 1812, making it the third oldest college in New York, after Columbia and Union, after it expanded to a four-year college curriculum.

Originally in the Town of Whitestown and then the Town of Paris, Clinton became part of the newly formed Town of Kirkland in 1827, and became an incorporated village in April 1843 with its own board of trustees, officials, employees, and status as a taxing jurisdiction.

According to Gordon&#x27;s 1836 &quot;Gazetteer&quot;, Clinton had 50 dwellings, six stores, four taverns, two clothing works, a worsted factory, a grist mill, three churches (Universalist, Baptist, and Congregational), two academies, and two seminaries.

Elihu Root, Secretary of State under President McKinley and Secretary of War under presidents McKinley and Roosevelt, was born in a building on the Hamilton College campus, and is probably Clinton&#x27;s most famous son.

Although never a factory town, Clinton did have the Clinton Knitting Company on the site of the Clinton House Apartments on Kirkland Avenue in the first half of the 20th century, as well as the Clinton Canning Company to process local vegetables in the late summer and fall.

The pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb began as the Clinton Pharmaceutical Company in 1887 on the second floor of 3-5 West Park Row and moved to Syracuse after three years. Both founders, William Bristol and John Myers, graduated from Hamilton College.

== Attractions ==


The village centers around the Village Green, a park where many community events take place. Annual events on and around the Village Green include a summer farmers market, the Shopper&#x27;s Stroll during the weekend after Thanksgiving, and the Clinton Art and Music festival in August. The Kirkland Art Center also hosts many activities throughout the year, including the KAC Road Race. The historic Clinton Cider Mill, a local favorite on Elm Street, has been producing cider since the early 1900s and is open seasonally from Labor Day through Thanksgiving.

The Clinton Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. There is also an active Clinton Historical Society.

==Education==
The Clinton Central School District covers Clinton and most of the surrounding town of Kirkland.. Its campus is near the center of Clinton.

Hamilton College is adjacent to the village, in the town of Kirkland.

=== History of education ===

In the 19th century, Clinton was known as a &quot;village of schools&quot; and was sometimes called &quot;Schooltown&quot; and described as &quot;an Academic village.&quot; The prosperity and reputation of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy had drawn public attention to Clinton as a place of education. It had numerous private schools, some day schools and some boarding, some secondary, of which there was no public school until 1891, and some primary. The largest building in town was a school (the Clinton Liberal Institute). A survey lists 37 schools, not counting Hamilton College, that operated in Clinton between 1790 (?) and 1915. A later list has 60, noting that &quot;many...were in...the stately homes throughout the town; A subsequent list located 70. Some of these were small, one-room schools, often short-lived, and not much information survives on them.

Prior to the passage of the New York State Compulsory School Law of 1894, about half of the town&#x27;s school-age children attended a school.

As put in 1878:

There was a public elementary or grammar school on East Park Row, which in 1802 was replaced by a brick building and in 1839 by a larger wood structure.

From 1793 to 1812 the Hamilton–Oneida Academy, forerunner of Hamilton College (1812), operated in what would later become Clinton. 
Its three-story building, torn down in 1830 or 1832, became the original building of the college.

Between the closing of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in 1812 and the opening of the Clinton Grammar School a &quot;classical&quot; (college preparatory) school operated at what is today (2023) the oldest house in Clinton, at 29 West Park Row.
In 1813 the Clinton Grammar School was founded; it was chartered in 1815. Under four different names, including Rural High School and Clinton Military Academy, it survived until 1892 and was primarily in two buildings at 86–88 College St., though in 1891 it consolidated with Kirkland Hall (see below) and met there. The school was considered a &quot;classical school&quot;, meaning it prepared students for college. Sometimes it had a &quot;Female Department&quot; Elihu Root, Mark Hopkins, and Grover Cleveland all studied there. It was torn down in 1900.

From 1814 to 1856 the Royce Academy was a boarding and day school for young ladies. Its last location was the former Royce mansion, at the intersection of Kirkland and Chenango Avenues. It closed upon the death of Miss Nancy Royce, an invalid who was the main instructor. &quot;Two or three Indian girls, of the Stockbridge tribe, were at one time members of this school.&quot;
The Clinton Liberal Institute was a coeducational preparatory school founded by the Universalist Church, operating at the corner of Utica and Mulberry Streets from 1831 to 1878, and then in Fort Plain until destroyed by fire in 1900. An advertisement in 1841 reveals that it had a female department, and among the subjects taught were Greek, Hebrew, French, Astronomy, and Moral Philosophy. The Female Department was located at 12 Utica Street until 1851, then moved to 13 Chestnut Street, across from William Street. In this latter location it was also known as the White Seminary. After the Institute moved to Fort Plain, this building housed Kirkland Hall, a school for boys.

In 1833, Rev. Hiram H. Kellogg, a Presbyterian minister, abolitionist, Hamilton College graduate, and good friend of Gerrit Smith, opened in Clinton a Young Ladies&#x27; Domestic Seminary, also called the Clinton Female Seminary and the Clinton Seminary, a counterpart to some extent to the all-male Oneida Institute. Like the Institute, it admitted students of all skin colors: three Negro girls. Another gives the number of Negro students as seven. The first was Mary E. Bibb, who became a teacher. Another was Louisa Matilda Jacobs, daughter of author Harriet Jacobs. A native American, Electa Quinney, also studied there, as did Elizabeth Smith Miller, daughter of Gerrit Smith (1835–1836). A manual labor school, it was located at 23 Kellogg Street, on the corner of Mulberry. The students spent &quot;a portion of each day&quot; on &quot;domestic avocations...to prepare them to run a household.&quot; This was interrupted in 1841; he became President of Knox College. Over 500 young ladies were educated in the eight years preceding his departure for Knox. The school, an inspiration for the seminary at Monticello, Illinois, the Mount Holyoke Seminary, and the Female Departments of Knox, Oberlin, and Elmira College, reopened less successfully from 1847 to 1850, after which it merged with the Clinton Grammar School. The original building survives.

In 1841, the Free Will Baptists purchased the building previously occupied by Kellogg&#x27;s Seminary, and established the Clinton Seminary. The Clinton Seminary began publication of a paper called the &quot;Clinton Seminary Advocate&quot;. When the school enrollment outgrew the building&#x27;s capacity it removed to the vacant Oneida Institute buildings and became the Whitestown Seminary. The former Kellogg&#x27;s Seminary buildings were reopened as a private school by Pelatiah Rawson, previously of the Oneida Institute, but Rawson&#x27;s health led it, within three years, to close (or rather, change ownership and name).

In 1844, the Clinton Grammar School, Clinton Liberal Institute, Clinton Seminary, and Hamilton Academy, all being under the supervision of the New York State Board of Regents which made them eligible, received state appropriations of $48.84, $274.01, $387.95, and $225.18 respectively. No other village in the area had as many recipient institutions, Together with the Oneida Institute, which received $86.82, other Oneida institutions made it the leading county. The Clinton Liberal Institute, along with other military subjects, offered fencing. In 1846, the Clinton Grammar School, Clinton Liberal Institute, and Hamilton Academy received state appropriations of $302.20, $369.35, and $271.67 respectively. In 1847, the Clinton Grammar School, Clinton Liberal Institute, and Clinton Academy received state appropriations ($262.89, $360.05, $45.73 respectively). The Clinton Grammar School received a state appropriation of $25 in 1849, and $105.36 in 1869. In 1873 the Clinton Grammar School and the Clinton Liberal Institute each received $149.23.

In 1849, an advertisement reveals that Miss Catherine Hopkins, for some years Principal of the Female Department of the Hamilton Academy, was running a Young Ladies&#x27; Seminary, where Latin, Greek, French, German, and Italian could be studied.

In 1854, a Home Cottage Seminary was founded, at 23 Chestnut St., &quot;at the west end of Chestnut Street,&quot; on the corner of Franklin Avenue, by Louisa M. Barker, previously Principal of the Female Department of the Clinton Liberal Institute. In 1861 it changed ownership and its name was changed to the Houghton Seminary (the maiden name of the associate principal and wife of the principal, Dr. John Chester Gallup, replaced in 1880 for health reasons by Prof. and Mrs. A. G. Benedict.). Its grounds occupied 20 acres. In 1874 its enrollment was 90—boys were one quarter of the enrollment—and it was described as &quot;in all respects highly prosperous.&quot; It had both an Academic and a Collegiate (college preparatory) Program.Its students were allowed to use the geological and chemical laboratories, the &quot;philosophical [scientific] apparatus,&quot; and the library of Hamilton College. Hamilton faculty gave courses of lectures in chemistry, anatomy, and physiology. Grover Cleveland&#x27;s sister and niece attended. Graduates of the college preparatory course were guaranteed admission, &quot;without examination&quot;, to Smith College. Starting about 1882, alumnae published the &quot;Houghton Record&quot;, 4 numbers per year in 1902. Houghton closed in 1903; Elihu Root was the final graduation speaker. Its books were given to the Kirkland Town Library. The building was torn down in 1912. At the time the name changed in 1861, the original founder, Miss Barker, set up a new, separate Home Seminary, known as the Cottage Seminary, on College Street. In 1878 it had an enrollment of 14 boarders; by 1890 this had risen to twenty. It occupied the same campus as the Clinton Central Middle School, and was said to have the most attractive campus of all of Clinton&#x27;s schools.

In 1858, a one-man Law School that was operated in Clinton by Theodore Dwight, son of Benjamin Dwight (see below), at Hamilton College was moved to New York City, &quot;where it will be maintained in connection with Columbia College.&quot;

In 1860, a &quot;picturesque&quot; Rural High School, occupying 18 acres at Elm St. and Norton Avenue (at the time Factory Street), operated in Clinton. It had a large gymnasium and a bowling alley, and was described by &quot;all who saw it as one of the largest and finest buildings in the county&quot;. It operated from 1858 to 1865, when the building burned, after which it moved into the building of the Clinton Grammar School. In 1873 enrollment was about 70. It was operated by Rev. Benjamin W. Dwight, who previously operated it in Brooklyn, N.Y. Maximum enrollment was 80, of whom 53 were boarders. It was for boys only, although towards the end, Dwight also ran Dwight&#x27;s School for Young Ladies, &quot;an English, French, and German Boarding School.&quot; It closed in 1882.

From 1861 to 1896 a Cottage School for girls, later renamed the Cottage Seminary, operated on the west side of current Chenango Avenue, at College Street. It was a combination boarding and day school. In 1898 it was converted into the Clinton Preparatory School, for boys, which operated until 1908.

Additional schools operating at this time included Miss Mary Brown&#x27;s School on College Street, and Miss Louisa Pond&#x27;s Select School (1830s–1840s). Miss Katherine Lee conducted in her home a school for young children from 1905 to 1912; another source says it closed in 1906. Mrs. Elizabeth Marr&#x27;s Select School, established in 1861, located finally at 8 Meadow St., continued late into the 1870s; in 1873 the enrollment was 26. Mrs. Chloe R. Garlinghouse&#x27;s school on Marvin Street operated from 1876 to 1891. Miss Martha Mears&#x27;s school on College Street was operated in the 1880s. Miss Anna Sykes conducted her Music School on Dwight Avenue for a number of years from 1872. Rev. Benjamin Dwight opened his home for a girls&#x27; school from 1865 to 1889.

In 1882 a school for boys, named Kirkland Hall, opened in the former White Seminary, vacant since the Clinton Liberal Institute moved to Fort Plain. It operated until 1889. It had an affiliated fraternity chapter, Theta Phi. Another source says that in 1886, the Flint Brothers &quot;reopened the Anderson school in the old Institute.&quot;

In 1884 a boarding and day school for girls was established, in a new building at the north-east corner of Marvin and Chestnut Streets. It was first named the Florence Seminary, then renamed Huntington Hall. It closed in 1888, the students moving to the Houghton Seminary.

In 1873, there were in Clinton &quot;two Schools for young gentlemen, and three for young ladies. In 1887, there were in Clinton three seminaries for young ladies, two high schools for young men, and one select and two common schools for children. In 1889, it was described as &quot;a village of Grammar schools and ladies&#x27; seminaries.&quot;

In 1891, Clinton&#x27;s public school started to offer classes in grades 1 through 12. 191 pupils enrolled on opening day. In 1893, the opening of the Clinton Union School and Academy, on Marvin Street, ended the need for private secondary schools, although the Clinton Preparatory School, described as &quot;military,&quot; occupying the facilities of the former Cottage Seminary on the site of today&#x27;s (2023) Middle School, lasted from 1873 until 1913. It used the 2nd floor of the Kirkland Town Library as its gymnasium. From 1920 to 1923 the 7th Day Adventist Church operated a boarding school for grades 7–10, called the Eastern New York Academy, on Brimfield Street.

<doc id="126842" wikidata="Q2237198" url="?curid=126842" title="Güiro">
<text>The güiro () is a percussion instrument consisting of an open-ended, hollow gourd with parallel notches cut in one side. It is played by rubbing a stick or tines (see photo) along the notches to produce a ratchet sound.

The güiro is commonly used in Cuban, Puerto Rican, and other forms of Latin American music, and plays a key role in the typical rhythm section of important genres like son, trova and salsa. Playing the güiro usually requires both long and short sounds, made by scraping up and down in long or short strokes.

The güiro, like the maracas, is often played by a singer. It is closely related to the Cuban guayo, Dominican güira, and Haitian graj which are made of metal. Other instruments similar to the güiro are the Colombian guacharaca, the Brazilian reco-reco, the Cabo Verdean ferrinho, the quijada (cow jawbone) and the frottoir (French) or fwotwa (French Creole) (washboard).

== Etymology ==
In the Arawakan language, a language of the indigenous people of Latin America and spread throughout the Caribbean spoken by groups such as the Taíno, güiro referred to fruit of the güira and an instrument made from fruit of the güira.

== Construction and design ==
The güiro is a notched, hollowed-out gourd. Often, the calabash gourd is used. The güiro is made by carving parallel circular stripes along the shorter section of the elongated gourd. Today, many güiros are made of wood or fiberglass.

== History ==
The güiro was adapted from an instrument which originated in South America. The Aztecs produced an early cousin to the güiro, called the &quot;omitzicahuastli&quot;, which was created from a small bone with serrated notches and was played in the same manner as the güiro. The Taíno people of the Caribbean have been credited with the origins of the güiro. The Taínos of Puerto Rico developed the &quot;güajey&quot;, a long gourd or animal bone with notches, an antecedent of the modern day güiro.

== Use in music ==
Across Latin America and the Caribbean, the güiro can be found in a variety of traditional, folk dance music and used in dance ensembles and religious festivals. In the Yucatán Peninsula, the güiro is used in two Mayan dances, the mayapax and the jarana. In Cuba, the güiro is used in the genre danzón. In Puerto Rico, the güiro often associated with the music of the jíbaro and is used in the musical genres of the plena, the seis, and the danza. In the Caribbean coast, the güiro was used in traditional, folk dance cumbia music and is still used in modern cumbia music. In Panama, the güiro can be found in folk dances such as the merjorana and cumbia.

=== Use in classical music ===

The güiro is used in classical music both to add Latin American flavor, and also purely for its instrumental qualities.

Examples of compositions including a güiro are &quot;Uirapuru&quot; by Heitor Villa-Lobos (though the score specifies reco-reco), &quot;Latin-American Symphonette&quot; by Morton Gould and &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; &quot;(Le Sacre du printemps&quot;) by Stravinsky.

<doc id="126844" wikidata="Q41271" url="?curid=126844" title="Internationalization and localization">
<text>In computing, internationalization and localization (American) or internationalisation and localisation (British), often abbreviated i18n and l10n respectively, are means of adapting to different languages, regional peculiarities and technical requirements of a target locale.

Internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by translating text and adding locale-specific components.

Localization (which is potentially performed multiple times, for different locales) uses the infrastructure or flexibility provided by internationalization (which is ideally performed only once before localization, or as an integral part of ongoing development).

== Naming ==
The terms are frequently abbreviated to the numeronyms &quot;i18n&quot; (where &quot;18&quot; stands for the number of letters between the first &quot;i&quot; and the last &quot;n&quot; in the word &quot;internationalization&quot;, a usage coined at Digital Equipment Corporation in the 1970s or 1980s) and &quot;l10n&quot; for &quot;localization&quot;, due to the length of the words. Some writers have the latter term capitalized (&quot;L10n&quot;) to help distinguish the two.

Some companies, like IBM and Oracle, use the term &quot;globalization&quot;, &quot;g11n&quot;, for the combination of internationalization and localization.

Microsoft defines internationalization as a combination of world-readiness and localization. World-readiness is a developer task, which enables a product to be used with multiple scripts and cultures (globalization) and separates user interface resources in a localizable format (localizability, abbreviated to &quot;L12y&quot;).

Hewlett-Packard and HP-UX created a system called &quot;National Language Support&quot; or &quot;Native Language Support&quot; (NLS) to produce localizable software.

Some vendors, including IBM use the term &quot;National Language Version&quot; (NLV) for localized versions of software products supporting only one specific locale. The term implies the existence of other alike NLV versions of the software for different markets; this terminology is not used where no internationalization and localization was undertaken and a software product only supports one language and locale in any version.

== Scope ==
According to &quot;Software without frontiers&quot;, the design aspects to consider when internationalizing a product are &quot;data encoding, data and documentation, software construction, hardware device support, and user interaction&quot;; while the key design areas to consider when making a fully internationalized product from scratch are &quot;user interaction, algorithm design and data formats, software services, and documentation&quot;.

Translation is typically the most time-consuming component of language localization. This may involve:
* For film, video, and audio, translation of spoken words or music lyrics, often using either dubbing or subtitles
* Text translation for printed materials, and digital media (possibly including error messages and documentation)
* Potentially altering images and logos containing text to contain translations or generic icons
* Different translation lengths and differences in character sizes (e.g. between Latin alphabet letters and Chinese characters) can cause layouts that work well in one language to work poorly in others
* Consideration of differences in dialect, register or variety
* Writing conventions like:
** Formatting of numbers (especially decimal separator and digit grouping)
** Date and time format, possibly including the use of different calendars (e.g. the Islamic or the Japanese calendar)

=== Standard locale data ===
Computer software can encounter differences above and beyond straightforward translation of words and phrases, because computer programs can generate content dynamically. These differences may need to be taken into account by the internationalization process in preparation for translation. Many of these differences are so regular that a conversion between languages can be easily automated. The Common Locale Data Repository by Unicode provides a collection of such differences. Its data is used by major operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, macOS and Debian, and by major Internet companies or projects such as Google and the Wikimedia Foundation. Examples of such differences include:

* Different &quot;scripts&quot; in different writing systems use different characters – a different set of letters, syllograms, logograms, or symbols. Modern systems use the Unicode standard to represent many different languages with a single character encoding.
* Writing direction is left to right in most European languages, right-to-left in Hebrew and Arabic, or both in boustrophedon scripts, and optionally vertical in some Asian languages.
* Complex text layout, for languages where characters change shape depending on context
* Capitalization exists in some scripts and not in others
* Different languages and writing systems have different text sorting rules
* Different languages have different numeral systems, which might need to be supported if Western Arabic numerals are not used
* Different languages have different pluralization rules, which can complicate programs that dynamically display numerical content. Other grammar rules might also vary, e.g. genitive.
* Different languages use different punctuation (e.g. quoting text using double-quotes (&quot; &quot;) as in English, or guillemets (« ») as in French)
* Keyboard shortcuts can only make use of buttons on the keyboard layout which is being localized for. If a shortcut corresponds to a word in a particular language (e.g. Ctrl-s stands for &quot;save&quot; in English), it may need to be changed.

=== National conventions ===
Different countries have different economic conventions, including variations in:

* Paper sizes
* Broadcast television systems and popular storage media
* Telephone number formats
* Postal address formats, postal codes, and choice of delivery services
* Currency (symbols, positions of currency markers, and reasonable amounts due to different inflation histories) – ISO 4217 codes are often used for internationalization
* System of measurement
* Battery sizes
* Voltage and current standards

In particular, the United States and Europe differ in most of these cases. Other areas often follow one of these.

Specific third-party services, such as online maps, weather reports, or payment service providers, might not be available worldwide from the same carriers, or at all.

Time zones vary across the world, and this must be taken into account if a product originally only interacted with people in a single time zone. For internationalization, UTC is often used internally and then converted into a local time zone for display purposes.

Different countries have different legal requirements, meaning for example:

* Regulatory compliance may require customization for a particular jurisdiction, or a change to the product as a whole, such as:
** Privacy law compliance
** Additional disclaimers on a website or packaging
** Different consumer labelling requirements
** Compliance with export restrictions and regulations on encryption
** Compliance with an Internet censorship regime or subpoena procedures
** Requirements for accessibility
** Collecting different taxes, such as sales tax, value added tax, or customs duties
** Sensitivity to different political issues, like geographical naming disputes and disputed borders shown on maps (e.g., India has proposed a bill that would make failing to show Kashmir and other areas as intended by the government a crime)
* Government-assigned numbers have different formats (such as passports, Social Security Numbers and other national identification numbers)

Localization also may take into account differences in culture, such as:

* Local holidays
* Personal name and title conventions
* Aesthetics
* Comprehensibility and cultural appropriateness of images and color symbolism
* Ethnicity, clothing, and socioeconomic status of people and architecture of locations pictured
* Local customs and conventions, such as social taboos, popular local religions, or superstitions such as blood types in Japanese culture vs. astrological signs in other cultures

== Business process for internationalizing software ==
To &quot;internationalize&quot; a product, it is important to look at a variety of markets that the product will foreseeably enter. Details such as field length for street addresses, unique format for the address, ability to make the postal code field optional to address countries that do not have postal codes or the state field for countries that do not have states, plus the introduction of new registration flows that adhere to local laws are just some of the examples that make internationalization a complex project. A broader approach takes into account cultural factors regarding for example the adaptation of the business process logic or the inclusion of individual cultural (behavioral) aspects.

Already in the 1990s, companies such as Bull used machine translation (Systran) on a large scale, for all their translation activity: human translators handled pre-editing (making the input machine-readable) and post-editing.

== Engineering ==
Both in re-engineering an existing software or designing a new internationalized software, the first step of internationalization is to split each potentially locale-dependent part (whether code, text or data) into a separate module. Each module can then either rely on a standard library/dependency or be independently replaced as needed for each locale.

The current prevailing practice is for applications to place text in resource files which are loaded during program execution as needed. These strings, stored in resource files, are relatively easy to translate. Programs are often built to reference resource libraries depending on the selected locale data.

The storage for translatable and translated strings is sometimes called a message catalog as the strings are called messages. The catalog generally comprises a set of files in a specific localization format and a standard library to handle said format. One software library and format that aids this is gettext.

Thus to get an application to support multiple languages one would design the application to select the relevant language resource file at runtime. The code required to manage data entry verification and many other locale-sensitive data types also must support differing locale requirements. Modern development systems and operating systems include sophisticated libraries for international support of these types, see also Standard locale data above.

Many localization issues (e.g. writing direction, text sorting) require more profound changes in the software than text translation. For example, OpenOffice.org achieves this with compilation switches.

== Process ==
A globalization method includes, after planning, three implementation steps: internationalization, localization and quality assurance.

To some degree (e.g. for quality assurance), development teams include someone who handles the basic/central stages of the process which then enables all the others. Such persons typically understand foreign languages and cultures and have some technical background. Specialized technical writers are required to construct a culturally appropriate syntax for potentially complicated concepts, coupled with engineering resources to deploy and test the localization elements.

Once properly internationalized, software can rely on more decentralized models for localization: free and open source software usually rely on self-localization by end-users and volunteers, sometimes organized in teams. The GNOME project, for example, has volunteer translation teams for over 100 languages. MediaWiki supports over 500 languages, of which 100 are mostly complete .

When translating existing text to other languages, it is difficult to maintain the parallel versions of texts throughout the life of the product. For instance, if a message displayed to the user is modified, all of the translated versions must be changed.

Independent software vendor such as Microsoft may provides reference software localization guidelines for developers. The software localization language may be different from written language.

== Commercial considerations ==
In a commercial setting, the benefit of localization is access to more markets. In the early 1980s, Lotus 1-2-3 took two years to separate program code and text and lost the market lead in Europe over Microsoft Multiplan. MicroPro found that using an Austrian translator for the West German market caused its WordStar documentation to, an executive said, not &quot;have the tone it should have had&quot;. When Tandy Corporation needed French and German translations of English error messages for the TRS-80 Model 4, the company&#x27;s Belgium office and five translators in the US produced six different versions that varied on the gender of computer components.

However, there are considerable costs involved, which go far beyond engineering. Further, business operations must adapt to manage the production, storage and distribution of multiple discrete localized products, which are often being sold in completely different currencies, regulatory environments and tax regimes.

Finally, sales, marketing and technical support must also facilitate their operations in the new languages, to support customers for the localized products. Particularly for relatively small language populations, it may never be economically viable to offer a localized product. Even where large language populations could justify localization for a given product, and a product&#x27;s internal structure already permits localization, a given software developer or publisher may lack the size and sophistication to manage the ancillary functions associated with operating in multiple locales.

<doc id="126845" wikidata="Q2104919" url="?curid=126845" title="Gothic fashion">
<text>Gothic fashion is a clothing style worn by members of the goth subculture. A dark, sometimes morbid, fashion and style of dress, typical gothic fashion includes black dyed hair and black clothes. Both male and female goths can wear dark eyeliner, dark nail polish and lipstick (most often black), and dramatic makeup. Styles are often borrowed from the Elizabethans and Victorians. BDSM imagery and paraphernalia are also common. Gothic fashion is sometimes confused with heavy metal fashion and emo fashion.

==Characteristics==

Cintra Wilson declares that &quot;The origins of contemporary goth style are found in the Victorian cult of mourning.&quot; Valerie Steele is an expert in the history of the style.

Goth subculture is stereotyped as eerie, mysterious, and complex, and the fashion is used as an outlet to express these characteristics. Goth fashion can be recognized by its stark black clothing. Ted Polhemus described goth fashion as a &quot;profusion of black velvets, lace, fishnets and leather tinged with scarlet or purple, accessorized with tightly laced corsets, gloves, precarious stilettos and silver jewelry depicting religious or occult themes&quot;.

Nancy Kilpatrick&#x27;s &quot;Goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined&quot; defines &quot;poseur&quot; for the goth scene as follows: &quot;goth wannabes, usually young kids going through a goth phase who do not hold to goth sensibilities but want to be part of the goth crowd (...)&quot;. Kilpatrick contributor &quot;Daoine O&#x27;&quot; denigrates poseur goths as &#x27;Batbabies&#x27; whose clothing is bought at [mall store] Hot Topic with their parents&#x27; money&quot;.

==Icons==
One female role model is Theda Bara, the 1910s femme fatale known for her dark eyeshadow. Siouxsie Sioux was particularly influential on the dress style of the gothic rock scene; Paul Morley of &quot;NME&quot; described Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; 1980 gig at Futurama: &quot;[Siouxsie was] modeling her newest outfit, the one that will influence how all the girls dress over the next few months. About half the girls at Leeds had used Sioux as a basis for their appearance, hair to ankle.&quot; Robert Smith, Musidora, Bela Lugosi, Bettie Page, Winona Ryder, Vampira, Morticia Addams, Nico, Rozz Williams, David Bowie, Lux Interior, Dave Vanian, are also style icons. The 1980s established designers such as Drew Bernstein of Lip Service, while the 1990s saw a surge of US-based gothic fashion designers, many of whom continue to evolve the style through the current day. Style magazines such as Gothic Beauty have given repeat features to a select few gothic fashion designers who began their labels in the 1990s, such as Kambriel, Rose Mortem, and Tyler Ondine of Heavy Red. Influential goth models include Wednesday Mourning and Lady Amaranth.

== Music ==

During the emergence of the goth subculture in 1980&#x27;s London, many genres of music played a large role in establishing the fashion trends - fashion spelled out the music an individual would listen to. Because of its origins, the major music inspirations during the early emergence of the goth subculture were similarly English bands. Some bands who have influence gothic fashion over the years include bands like Bauhaus, the Cure, Sisters of Mercy and Siouxsie and the Banshees. The Batcave was a nightclub in London, between 1982–1986, that hosted live music and paid homage to all things goth. The interior, as described by Kelly Rankin, included cobwebbed ceilings and a real coffin at the entrance. She says that &quot;The Batcave became iconic because it aided the progression of this movement.&quot;

==Variations==
===Deathrock===
Deathrock fashion, much like goth music, is closely related to goth fashion. The influences of the style come from a blend of glam rock, punk rock, gothic horror literature, and undead characters of classic horror films. The aesthetic was born from the early Los Angeles punk rock scene, and gained influences from fashion worn by patrons of the Batcave club in the UK as the two regional scenes had met. Many deathrockers have a dark DIY punk approach on their attire. The common theme of the aesthetic is dominantly black clothing: shirts featuring deathrock bands or horror themes, torn fishnets as a shirt and/or hosiery, pale fleshtone or pale white foundation and powder makeup on the face, black or darkly colored eye makeup, combat boots or Doc Martens, and skirts, leggings, slim fit pants or shorts. Iconic hairstyles of this style are the &quot;Deathhawk&quot;, mohawks or variants of mohawks, and spiky or teased hair. The horror punk and deathrock fashion section of the punk fashion article has more details.

===Haute goth===
In 1977, Karl Lagerfeld hosted the Soirée Moratoire Noir party, specifying &quot;tenue tragique noire absolument obligatoire&quot; (black tragic dress absolutely required). The event included elements associated with leatherman style.

Goth fashion has a reciprocal relationship with the fashion world. In the later part of the first decade of the 21st century, designers such as Alexander McQueen, Anna Sui, Rick Owens, Gareth Pugh, Ann Demeulemeester, Philipp Plein, Hedi Slimane, John Richmond, John Galliano, Olivier Theyskens and Yohji Yamamoto brought elements of goth to runways. This was described as &quot;Haute Goth&quot; by Cintra Wilson in the &quot;New York Times&quot;. Thierry Mugler, Claude Montana, Jean Paul Gaultier and Christian Lacroix have also been associated with a gothic style. In Spring 2004, Riccardo Tisci, Jean Paul Gaultier, Raf Simons and Stefano Pilati dressed their models as &quot;glamorous ghouls dressed in form-fitting suits and coal-tinted cocktail dresses&quot;. Swedish designer Helena Hörstedt and jewelry artist Hanna Hedman also practice a goth aesthetic.

===Gothic Lolita===
Gothic Lolita, sometimes shortened to in Japanese (or &quot;goth loli&quot; in roman characters), is a combination of gothic and lolita fashions. The fashion originated in the late 1990s in Harajuku.

Gothic Lolita fashion is characterized by darker make-up and clothing. Red lipstick and smoky or neatly defined eyes, created using black eyeliner, are typical styles, although as with all lolita sub-styles the look remains fairly natural. Though Gothic make-up has been associated with a white-powdered face, this is usually considered poor taste within the (largely Japanese) lolita fashion scene.

Brands which exemplify the Gothic Lolita style include Atelier-Pierrot, Atelier Boz, Black Peace Now, H. Naoto Blood and Moi-même-Moitié. Author and TV Host La Carmina is a popular model of Gothic Lolita fashion.

===Aristocrat===
Aristocrat is a type of Japanese street fashion, championed by the visual kei rock musician Mana with his fashion label Moi-même-Moitié, and influenced by gothic and Neo-Victorian fashions. A typical outfit will combine elements of fetish wear with Victorian and sometimes steampunk fashions, including tight pants, velvet sportcoats, top hats, cravats, corsets, ankle length skirts, lace petticoats, and the frilly pirate shirts previously popularised by the New Romantics of the 1980s.

===Cybergoth===

The Cybergoth and rivethead subcultures emerged in America during the late 1990s, and combined classic gothic fashions such as leather duster coats, tripp pants or Demonia brand platform boots with the clothing worn by fans of industrial metal and rave music to create a dystopian, futuristic science fiction look. Shaved heads, synthetic neon dreadlocks, camouflage, tight leather pants, chains, platform boots, stretched body piercings, sleeve tattoos, goggles, corsets, PVC or leather skirts, and black trenchcoats decorated with metal studs are frequently seen on members of this subculture.

===Traditional goth===
Traditional goth (or trad goth) is a term defining the aesthetic that reflects the classic and original aesthetics of Goth from the 1980s. The examples are from the attire worn by Bauhaus, Siouxsie Sioux and the Cure. Dominantly black clothing, creepers, winklepickers, and backcombed, disheveled hair are common. Patrons of the Batcave club in the UK had an impact on the fashion with the attire they wore. This also has close relation to the deathrock revival and fashion, as the 1980s goth and Batcave fashion influenced the aesthetic over the decades into the 2010s.

=== Victorian goth ===

Victorian goth is a modern fashion movement that interprets and redefines certain aspects regarding fashion of the Victorian Era. The Victorian Era is notable for having big dresses and elegant hair, and these elements have made subsequent integration into modern day main stream gothic fashion. With early inspiration taken from medieval settings that were used by Edgar Allan Poe, in addition to late-Victorian examples of gothic fashion that are used in Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;.

== Social media influence ==
Social media has increased the level of awareness surrounding gothic fashion trends, but this has also modified the dynamic and expectations within the community itself. Bianca Wooden describes the emergence of a new wave of goth fad fashion and says that &quot;goth has become less of an organic movement and more of a calculated brand&quot;.

=== Performative gothic fashion ===
Goth YouTuber Angela Benedict describes in this video, some of the negative impacts that social media has had on gothic fashion. Some of these include the increased emergence of &quot;elitist goths&quot; who shame others for not being &quot;goth&quot; enough. This has led to many online goths who portray their gloomy attire and dramatic makeup looks only to take pictures or film videos.

== History ==
The first settlers were the Brothertown Indians, a group of about 400 people formed from scattered remnants of tribes from New England and Long Island, led by Asa Dick and Samson Occom, who arrived around 1774. They were granted land by the Oneida Indians, for the purpose of creating a new township for Christian Indians. They made their homes around the Oriskany Creek, which provided power for their grist mills. Many Brotherton Indians left town during the Revolutionary War, returning after end of the war to farm. Because Brotherton Indians came from different peoples whose languages were not mutually intelligible, many adopted the English language. The number of Brotherton Indians had dwindled by 1850, with some succumbing to alcoholism, and others selling their land and moving to Green Bay, Wisconsin.

<text>New York Mills is a village in Oneida County, New York, United States. The population was 3,327 at the 2010 census.

The village of New York Mills is partly in the town of Whitestown and partly in the town of New Hartford. It is a western suburb of the city of Utica.

==History==
There were four mills which gave the village its name. They dated from around 1808 and closed in the 1950s. The Middle Mill Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

James S. Pula and Eugene E. Dziedzic provide a detailed history on the village in their book &quot;New York Mills (Images of America)&quot;:
New York Mills, named for the textile factories that were once the backbone of the surrounding villages economy, ranked among the foremost producers of quality fabrics in the country. Originally a wilderness area just south of the Mohawk River, the community began with a few scattered homes after the establishment of a small textile mill in 1808. Nourished by a growing economy, the village attracted a mosaic of Welsh and French-Canadian workers in the 19th century, followed by Poles, Syro-Lebanese, and Italians in the early 20th century. A hotbed of abolitionism in the antebellum years, it sent high percentages of its residents off to the Civil War, World War I, and World War II. In 1912 and 1916, its Polish residents founded a union and led textile strikes that were considered the most successful in the nation at that time. With the eventual closing of the mills in the 1950s, residents found employment in the surrounding area as the village evolved into a stable and prosperous suburban community.

After the Revolutionary War, which started in the year of 1775 and ended in 1783, an act was passed and the town of Whitestown was formed. There was a piece of land west of Sadaquada Creek newly given the name New York Mills. People started to settle down on this small piece of land and create a life there in 1902. The people of the village built a school house, organized a school district for other settlers and their children. In 1902 Walcott &amp;. Co was formed.

In 1810 mill number 2 of 4 was formed &quot;Oneida Manufacturing Society.&quot; In 1813 mill number 3 &quot;Whitestown Cotton and Woolen Manufacturing Society&quot; was formed and began operating in 1827. 1870 the Burr Stone mill was created and lastly mill number 4 of 4 was built and operating in 1902. New York Mills was full of booming industries before it became a village. The village is close to major rivers, the Mohawk river being one, and &quot;many lakes and the spectacular Adirondack Mountains where residents can be dazzled by the fresh water lakes, valleys or mountains within a short time.&quot;

The village has always been fairly small considering it is located in between, and in close proximity to, the two larger villages of New Hartford and Whitesboro [New York Mills also adjoins the village of Yorkville, both being western suburbs of the City of Utica]. The village incorporated a blacksmith, bakery, drug stores, and a few hotels. The name New York Mills originated from the mills that were located in the small village. In 1870 the Burr Stone Mill was built. It is massive in size and stands four and a half stories high, &quot;the mill is 250 feet long and 70 feet wide&quot;. Weaving machinery was dedicated to the first floor of the building. &quot;The remaining floors two, three, and four were for spooling, carding, and warping.&quot;

In 1909, the mills of the New York Mills Corporation went into foreclosure and were purchased by Augustus D. Juilliard Company. The Juilliard Company sold the mills again in 1953.

In 1902, Benjamin Stuart Walcott Sr. and his son, Benjamin Stuart Walcott Jr. opened the Walcott &amp; Campbell Spinning Mill on Sauquoit Street. The Walcotts established the mill near Sadaquada Creek because they saw the potential of water power from the creek. After the mill shut down near mid-century, the building was split into two units, with the south side of the building occupied by the Nehi Bottling Works, and the north side occupied by Husted Concrete Products, a company that manufactured concrete pipe. As early as 1878, a high percentage of immigrants became an integral part of the villages population&quot;. At this time Polish Immigrants began to settle in New York Mills to look for jobs and a place to live. Since the inception of the village, many improvements have been made such as road paving and updating old buildings that were built 75 years ago. However, &quot;from its meager beginnings New York Mills has evolved and shaped up in throughout the past centuries&quot;

Oneida Castle is east of the city of Oneida (located in Madison County) and west of the city of Sherrill in New York State.

== History ==
The village was formerly the site of a major fortified village, Kanonwalohale (written as &quot;tkanaˀalóhaleˀ&quot; modern Oneida orthography), of the Oneida tribe, one of the original Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. They established it in the beginning of the 18th century, moving from an area where they suffered raids by parties from the French colony of Quebec, which was trying to control their fur trade. The village was surrounded by tall wooden palisades, with a moat bordering this. Dwellings and storage structures were protected inside. Mohawk Joseph Brant led a war party which destroyed the village in July 1780.

Later European-American settlers named the village of Oneida Castle for this last great village or &quot;castle&quot; of the Oneida people. In the colonial period, Europeans often referred to the major fortified Iroquois villages as &quot;castles&quot; because it was a familiar reference for them for such a settlement; other examples include Seneca Castle and Genesee Castle.

<text>Oriskany ( or ) is a village in Oneida County, New York, United States. The population was 1,315 at the 2020 census. The name is derived from the Iroquois word for &quot;nettles&quot;.

The village of Oriskany is in the town of Whitestown, southeast of Rome, New York. NY-69 passes through the village, which is south of the Erie Canal.

== History ==
The Oneida village of Oriska was established at the confluence of the Oriskany Creek and the Mohawk River before 1766. Oriska, sometimes also spelled as Ockrisk, Oriska, or Oriske, is believed to be a linguistic corruption of &quot;Ol Hiskè&quot; meaning &quot;a place of nettles.&quot;

On August 5, 1777, during the American Revolution, Oriska was visited by the Tryon County militia led by Brigadier General Nicholas Herkimer. The American-aligned militia was en route to Fort Stanwix to help lift a siege by allied British forces. Several dozen to one hundred Oneida joined Herkimer&#x27;s militia for the trip.

On the morning of August 6, 1777, the forces left Oriska for Fort Stanwix but were met by an ambush about three miles outside of Oriska. The location today is marked by the Oriskany Battlefield State Historic Site.

The Tory Mohawk who allied with the British later retaliated against Oriska, destroying &quot;stock and provisions&quot; of the village&#x27;s residents.

Records of the village for the remainder of the war remain sparse. In a letter dated November 30, 1778, Major General Philip Schuyler implores General Washington that &quot;for the Support of the Communication and Security of Convoys&quot; between Albany and Oswego &quot;Another post to be Occupied by a like number [of 50 men] should be Established At or near Oriska,&quot; among seven other sites.Founders Online: To George Washington from Major General Philip Schuyler, 30 No …

In June 1785, the area was surveyed by G. Lansing for a map entitled &quot;Surveys &amp; Partition of the Oriskany or Oriskary Patent,&quot; with seven allotments and numerous land claims noted.

Before 1810, the surveyor, Col. Gerritt Lansing, returned to the Oriskany Patent to settle. In 1811, he helped found the Oriskany Manufacturing Company. The company&#x27;s year of incorporation is commonly cited as the founding date for the resettled village.

Oriskany Manufacturing Company would operate for several decades. The site later became the Waterbury Felt Mill.

The Erie Canal passed through the village until it was surpassed by the NYS Barge Canal. The path of the earlier canal later became State Route 69.

The naming of the village from Oriska to Oriskany has become something of an urban legend. As the legend goes, there was a mix up at the post office - a missing comma. Instead of &quot;Oriska, NY&quot; the envelope was labeled as &quot;Oriska NY&quot; and shortly after &quot;Oriskany, NY&quot; was born. This post office legend is disproven by several eighteenth century documents that use &quot;Oriskany,&quot; including letters from the Founding Fathers&#x27; papers and several extant maps, which antedate the founding of the local post office by decades.

==USS &quot;Oriskany&quot;==

Oriskany had an aircraft carrier named after an American Revolutionary War battle fought there. served the United States Navy from 1950 to 1976. On May 17, 2006, the ship was laid to rest as an artificial reef in the Gulf of Mexico near Pensacola, Florida. Trinkaus Park, located in Oriskany, has several monuments erected in memory of USS &quot;Oriskany&quot;. Among the monuments in the park are items from the ship itself including a bell, an anchor, and a Douglas A-4 Skyhawk aircraft.

Rome is one of two principal cities in the Utica–Rome Metropolitan Statistical Area, which lies in the &quot;Leatherstocking Country&quot; made famous by James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Leatherstocking Tales,&quot; set in frontier days before the American Revolutionary War. Rome is in New York&#x27;s 21st congressional district.

The city developed at an ancient portage site of Native Americans, including the historic Iroquois nations. This portage continued to be strategically important to Europeans, who also used the main 18th and 19th-century waterways, based on the Mohawk and Hudson rivers, that connected New York City and the Atlantic seaboard to the Great Lakes. The original European settlements developed around fortifications erected in the 1750s to defend the waterway, in particular the British Fort Stanwix (1763) built in New York.

Following the American Revolution, the settlement began to grow with the construction of the Rome Canal in 1796, to connect Wood Creek (leading from Lake Ontario) and the headwaters of the Mohawk River. In the same year the state created the Town of Rome as a section of Oneida County. For a time, the small community next to the canal was informally known as Lynchville, after the original owner of the property, the prominent wine merchant Dominick Lynch.

The New York State Legislature converted the Town of Rome into a city on February 23, 1870. The residents have called Rome the &quot;City of American History&quot;.

==History==

===Oneida Carrying Place===
Rome was founded along an ancient Native American portage path known as the &quot;Oneida Carrying Place&quot;, &quot;Deo-Wain-Sta&quot;, or &quot;The Great Carrying Place&quot; to the Six Nations (Iroquois), or the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot; in their language. These names refer to a portage road or path between the Mohawk River to the east, which flows east to the Hudson River,and Wood Creek to the west, which flows into Oneida Lake and, eventually, Lake Ontario via the Oneida and Oswego Rivers. Now located within the modern Rome city limits, this short portage path was the only overland section of a water trade route stretching more than 1,000 miles between Lake Ontario and the lower Hudson. Travelers and traders coming up the Mohawk River from the Hudson had to transfer their cargo and boats and transport them overland between 1.7 and six miles (depending on the season) to continue west on Wood Creek to Oneida Lake which was drained by the Oswego River that ultimately flowed into Lake Ontario. This ancient trade route joined the Great Lakes and Canada via the Mohawk River to the Hudson River and the Atlantic Ocean.
During the French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War, this region was the scene of much fighting. The British colonists had erected several small forts to guard the Oneida Carrying Place and the lucrative fur trade against French incursions from Canada; however, a combined French regular army, Canadian, and allied Native American force overwhelmed and massacred a British force here in the Battle of Fort Bull. Later in 1758, after several abortive attempts to fortify the area, the British sent a very large force to secure the Oneida Carry and build a stronger rampart complex, which they named Fort Stanwix.

Following their defeat by Britain during the war, the French ceded their territory in North America east of the Mississippi River to the British. The British signed the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768 with the Iroquois, under the terms of which they promised to preserve areas west of the Appalachian Mountains as an Indian reserve and to prohibit American colonial settlement. The treaty has also been described as &quot;the last desperate effort of the British to create order west of the Appalachians. The British were unable to enforce their promise, as American colonists continued to move west of the Appalachians, causing conflicts with native tribes. The British abandoned Ft. Stanwix after that war; it deteriorated and was eventually torn down, its parts and materials used by settlers for other structures.

===Revolutionary War and Fort Stanwix===

At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, American Continental forces took control of the Fort Stanwix site, rebuilding and improving the fort. The installation survived a siege by the British in the Saratoga Campaign of 1777, and it became renowned as &quot;the fort that never surrendered&quot;. Patriot militia, regulars, and their Oneida Nation allies under the command of Col. Peter Gansevoort, successfully repelled a prolonged siege in August 1777 by British, German, Loyalist, and Canadian troops and warriors from several Native American nations, all commanded by British Gen. Barry St. Leger. The failed siege, combined with the battle at nearby Oriskany as well as the battles of Bennington, and Saratoga, thwarted a coordinated British effort to take the northern colonies. Following this success, the Americans were able to gain alliances with France and the Netherlands, as both countries were becoming more confident that the rebels had a chance to win.

After the repulsion of the British at Fort Stanwix, bloody fighting erupted along the American northern frontier and throughout the Mohawk Valley. There were heavy losses for both American settlers and the people of the Six Nations, as each side made retaliatory raids against the other in a round of violence. Because many of the Oneida were fighting with the rebels and against the four nations allied with the British, especially the Mohawk and Seneca, the Iroquois had members attacking each other, which they had avoided doing earlier in this century.

The Americans used Fort Stanwix as the primary staging point for attacks against British loyalist units and their Haudenosaunee allies. The Sullivan Expedition of 1779 was launched from here as a scorched earth campaign against villages of Iroquois nations that were allied with the British. Commander George Washington ordered the campaign in retaliation for the fierce frontier attacks in New York, such as the Cherry Valley Massacre by Loyalist irregulars led by Mohawk Chief Joseph Brant and John Butler. The Sullivan campaign destroyed nearly 50 Iroquois villages and their food stores, leading to starvation of many people of these nations during the following winter. Many Iroquois went to Upper Canada for refuge but struggled with starvation there, too.

The American forces abandoned the fort in 1781. After the war, as the area became settled, pioneers took materials to use in constructing their own homes and barns. They built the Rome Canal along Wood Creek, to connect it to the Mohawk River and enable continuous passage by water from Lake Ontario via the Mohawk and Hudson rivers to New York City.

After completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, development of Rome increased. The city became an industrial and trade center in the western Mohawk Valley. The fort site was reduced to a mound of dirt, with bushes and grasses growing over it. During the Great Depression in the early 20th century, Congress passed the Fort Stanwix Act of 1935 to establish the fort as a National Monument because of the site&#x27;s historic importance. The site was administered by the National Park Service (NPS).

In 1973, the NPS began reconstruction of Fort Stanwix, based on historical evidence related to 18th-century construction and occupation. It was completed in 1976. The fort is operated by the National Park Service as a museum. On July 2, 2005, the Marinus Willet Center opened on the grounds of the monument. It provides audio-visual programs to orient visitors, as well as secure storage space for the museum&#x27;s collection of artifacts and related historic materials.

===Commercial growth: Erie Canal===
The critical east/west American trade route through the frontier was improved by construction of the Erie Canal. On July 4, 1817, construction on the canal began in Rome. The Erie Canal reaches a summit in Rome, attaining an elevation of 420 feet. The first phase was completed in 1825, connecting the Hudson River by waterway to the Great Lakes. It resulted in an increase in trade and traffic between communities around the Great Lakes and New York City, stimulating development all along the route.

===Copper City===

During the Industrial Revolution, Rome became known as the “Copper City,” as its metal industries produced approximately 10 percent of all copper in the United States. In 1851, Jesse Williams founded the first cheese factory in the United States at Rome. Williams also developed the process used today for large-scale cheese manufacturing. During the later 19th century, there were numerous dairy farms in the area and throughout the Mohawk Valley. Many shipped their milk and cheese to customers in New York City.

The City of Rome was incorporated in 1870.

Revere Copper Products, Inc., founded in Rome during 1928 and 1929, is one of the oldest manufacturing companies in the United States. It developed from a series of mergers between several companies, including Revere Copper Company located in Canton, Massachusetts. The first president of Revere Copper Products, Inc, George H. Allen, was formerly the president of Michigan Copper and Brass Company, which was one of the companies included in the merger. The early history of Revere Copper Products, Inc is detailed in the book &quot;Copper Heritage: The Story of Revere Copper and Brass, Inc.&quot; by Isaac F. Marcosson. At one time, 10 percent of all copper products used in the United States were manufactured in Rome.

===Cold War to present day===
Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome was open from 1942 to 1995, when it closed as part of the Base Realignment and Closure process. It remains home to Rome Laboratory, which is now part of the Air Force Research Laboratory, and to the Eastern Air Defense Sector. Some of the land that formerly made up the land has been redeveloped: Rome Free Academy, the city&#x27;s public high school, moved onto former base land in 2002. Its airstrip is now part of Griffiss Airport.

Woodstock 1999 was held in Rome, at the former Griffiss AFB site. The three-day rock festival was held over the weekend of July 23–25, and drew a crowd of about 200,000 people. Cable network MTV covered the concert extensively, and live coverage of the entire weekend was available on pay-per-view. The festival featured acts including Metallica, Kid Rock, DMX, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rage Against the Machine, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Alanis Morissette and Wyclef Jean; early reviews for many of the acts were positive. Critics particularly praised performances by George Clinton, Jamiroquai, James Brown, Sheryl Crow, and Rage Against the Machine. However, the festival ended in a riot, with bonfires being lit in the crowd, brawls with police, and looting.

During the September 11 attacks, Boston Center contacted the Eastern Air Defense Sector in Rome at 8:37 AM. This was the first report of a hijacking that reached NORAD on that day.
On July 16, 2024, a high-end EF2 tornado struck Rome, causing widespread power outages and property damage. The tornado touched down just north of the Erie Canal, passed through the center of Rome, and lifted up on the far side of Griffiss Air Force Base. A decommissioned B-52 on display near the airport was moved nearly 25 feet off its platform. Among other heavily damaged structures, two churches were heavily damaged, losing their steeples and having their roofs collapse. Many brick structures collapsed. State of emergencies were declared by the city, county, and state governments.

==Geography==
Rome is the second-largest city by area in New York State, and the 140th largest city in the United States. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.99%) is water.

New York State Route 26, New York State Route 46, New York State Route 49 and New York State Route 69 converge in downtown Rome and are part of two separate triplexes. New York State Route 233 becomes part of a duplex with NY 69 south of the inner district before meeting its northern terminus at the Utica-Rome Expressway (NY 49). New York State Route 365 passes through the eastern portion of the outer district before becoming part of the Utica-Rome Expressway at an interchange.

Summer high temperatures range from . The city is in USDA plant hardiness zone 5b, and native vegetation can tolerate temperatures from .
Rome averages over of snowfall each winter, mostly due to its proximity to Lake Ontario and the lake-effect snow that it produces.

==Demographics==
The city had its peak of population in 1960, with declines caused by restructuring of industry and loss of jobs. Later in the 20th century, the closure of the Air Force base also drew away jobs and residents. The city has worked to develop a new economy. Elements of the base have been redeveloped for new uses, while high-quality research continues.

==Economy==
Rome is headquarters to AmeriCU Credit Union, which serves members in Central and Northern New York.

Rome Memorial Hospital is another major local employer. &quot;Rome Hospital&quot; opened in 1884. In 1940 it combined with the 1920-founded &quot;Murphy Memorial Hospital&quot;. The resultant &quot;Rome Memorial Hospital&quot; is licensed for 129 beds.

==Sports==
One of Rome&#x27;s most popular venues is the John F. Kennedy Civic Arena. The facility hosts multiple ice hockey and figure skating events, as well as roller derby bouts. The arena was constructed in 1963–1964. It was fully renovated in 2008.

Between 1964 and 1988, the Rome Knights and later the Copper City Chiefs played their home games on Saturday evenings at the Kennedy Arena. The Chiefs were a semi-professional ice hockey club that competed against Senior and Intermediate level teams from the province of Ontario, Canada; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Newark, New Jersey; New England, and cities from the State of New York. The Chiefs were known for a physical and aggressive style of ice hockey, the team roster being built around team toughness. In its 25 years, the Chiefs never had a losing season.

The professional sports franchise, the Rome Frenzy of the Federal Hockey League, made Rome its base and began play in November 2010 at the Kennedy Civic Arena. In February 2011, citing poor attendance, the Frenzy suspended operations and cancelled the last three weeks of the season in Rome.

Rome is also the headquarters of Hamilton College Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Rowing. Their boathouse, completed in 2022, is located in Bellamy Harbor Park off the Erie Canal.

<doc id="126860" wikidata="Q1298934" url="?curid=126860" title="Synth-pop">
<text>Synth-pop (short for synthesizer pop; also called techno-pop) is a music genre that first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the Krautrock of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late 1970s.

Electronic musical synthesizers that could be used practically in a recording studio became available in the mid-1960s, and the mid-1970s saw the rise of electronic art musicians. After the breakthrough of Gary Numan in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s. In Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra introduced the TR-808 rhythm machine to popular music, and the band would be a major influence on early British synth-pop acts. The development of inexpensive polyphonic synthesizers, the definition of MIDI and the use of dance beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the New Romantic movement, together with the rise of MTV, led to success for large numbers of British synth-pop acts in the US during the Second British Invasion.

The term &quot;techno-pop&quot; was coined by Yuzuru Agi in his critique of Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; in 1978 and is considered a case of multiple discovery of naming. Hence, the term can be used interchangeably with &quot;synth-pop&quot;, but is more frequently used to describe the scene of Japan. The term &quot;techno-pop&quot; became also popular in Europe, where it started: German band Kraftwerk&#x27;s 1986 album was titled &quot;Techno Pop&quot;; English band the Buggles has a song named &quot;Technopop&quot; and Spanish band Mecano described their style as tecno-pop.

&quot;Synth-pop&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;electropop&quot;, but &quot;electropop&quot; may also denote a variant of synth-pop that places more emphasis on a harder, more electronic sound. In the mid to late 1980s, duos such as Erasure and Pet Shop Boys adopted a style that was highly successful on the US dance charts, but by the end of the decade, the synth-pop of bands such as A-ha and Alphaville was giving way to house music and techno. Interest in synth-pop began to revive in the indietronica and electroclash movements in the late 1990s, and in the 2000s synth-pop enjoyed a widespread revival and commercial success.

The genre has received criticism for alleged lack of emotion and musicianship; prominent artists have spoken out against detractors who believed that synthesizers themselves composed and played the songs. Synth-pop music has established a place for the synthesizer as a major element of pop and rock music, directly influencing subsequent genres (including house music and Detroit techno) and has indirectly influenced many other genres, as well as individual recordings.

==Characteristics==

Synth-pop is defined by its primary use of synthesizers, drum machines and sequencers, sometimes using them to replace all other instruments. Borthwick and Moy have described the genre as diverse but &quot;characterised by a broad set of values that eschewed rock playing styles, rhythms and structures&quot;, which were replaced by &quot;synthetic textures&quot; and &quot;robotic rigidity&quot;, often defined by the limitations of the new technology, including monophonic synthesizers (only able to play one note at a time).

Many synth-pop musicians had limited musical skills, relying on the technology to produce or reproduce the music. The result was often minimalist, with grooves that were &quot;typically woven together from simple repeated riffs often with no harmonic &#x27;progression&#x27; to speak of&quot;. Early synth-pop has been described as &quot;eerie, sterile, and vaguely menacing&quot;, using droning electronics with little change in inflection. Common lyrical themes of synth-pop songs were isolation, urban anomie, and feelings of being emotionally cold and hollow.

In its second phase in the 1980s, the introduction of dance beats and more conventional rock instrumentation made the music warmer and catchier and contained within the conventions of three-minute pop. Synthesizers were increasingly used to imitate the conventional and clichéd sound of orchestras and horns. Thin, treble-dominant, synthesized melodies and simple drum programmes gave way to thick, and compressed production, and a more conventional drum sound. Lyrics were generally more optimistic, dealing with more traditional subject matter for pop music such as romance, escapism and aspiration. According to music writer Simon Reynolds, the hallmark of 1980s synth-pop was its &quot;emotional, at times operatic singers&quot; such as Marc Almond, Alison Moyet and Annie Lennox. Because synthesizers removed the need for large groups of musicians, these singers were often part of a duo where their partner played all the instrumentation.

Although synth-pop in part arose from punk rock, it abandoned punk&#x27;s emphasis on &quot;authenticity&quot; and often pursued a deliberate &quot;artificiality&quot;, drawing on the critically derided forms such as disco and glam rock. It owed relatively little to the foundations of early popular music in jazz, folk music or the blues, and instead of looking to America, in its early stages, it consciously focused on European and particularly Eastern European influences, which were reflected in band names like Spandau Ballet and songs like Ultravox&#x27;s &quot;Vienna&quot;. Later synth-pop saw a shift to a style more influenced by other genres, such as soul music.

==History==
===Precursors===
Electronic musical synthesizers that could be used practically in a recording studio became available in the mid-1960s, around the same time as rock music began to emerge as a distinct musical genre. The Mellotron, an electro-mechanical, polyphonic sample-playback keyboard was overtaken by the Moog synthesizer, created by Robert Moog in 1964, which produced completely electronically generated sounds. The portable Minimoog, which allowed much easier use, particularly in live performance was widely adopted by progressive rock musicians such as Richard Wright of Pink Floyd and Rick Wakeman of Yes. Instrumental prog rock was particularly significant in continental Europe, allowing bands like Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Can and Faust to circumvent the language barrier. Their synthesizer-heavy &quot;Kraut rock&quot;, along with the work of Brian Eno (for a time the keyboard player with Roxy Music), would be a major influence on subsequent synth rock.

In 1971, the British film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; was released with a synth soundtrack by American Wendy Carlos. It was the first time many in the United Kingdom had heard electronic music. Philip Oakey of the Human League and Richard H. Kirk of Cabaret Voltaire, as well as music journalist Simon Reynolds, have cited the soundtrack as an inspiration. Electronic music made occasional moves into the mainstream, with jazz musician Stan Free, under the pseudonym Hot Butter, having a top 10 hit in the United States and United Kingdom in 1972, with a cover of the 1969 Gershon Kingsley song &quot;Popcorn&quot; using a Moog synthesizer, which is recognised as a forerunner to synth-pop and disco.
The mid-1970s saw the rise of electronic art musicians such as Jean Michel Jarre, Vangelis, and Tomita. Tomita&#x27;s album &quot;Electric Samurai: Switched on Rock&quot; (1972) featured electronic renditions of contemporary rock and pop songs, while utilizing speech synthesis and analog music sequencers. In 1975, Kraftwerk played their first British show and inspired concert attendees Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys – who would later found Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) – to &#x27;throw away their guitars&#x27; and become a synth act. Kraftwerk had its first hit UK record later in the year with &quot;Autobahn&quot;, which reached number 11 in the British Singles Chart and number 12 in Canada. The group was described by the BBC Four program &quot;Synth Britannia&quot; as the key to synth-pop&#x27;s future rise there. In 1977, Giorgio Moroder released the electronic Eurodisco song &quot;I Feel Love&quot; that he had produced for Donna Summer, and its programmed beats would be a major influence on the later synth-pop sound. David Bowie&#x27;s Berlin Trilogy, comprising the albums &quot;Low&quot; (1977), &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; (1977), and &quot;Lodger&quot; (1979), all featuring Brian Eno, would also be highly influential.

The Cat Stevens album &quot;Izitso&quot;, released in April 1977, updated his pop rock style with the extensive use of synthesizers, giving it a more synth-pop style; &quot;Was Dog a Doughnut&quot; in particular was an early techno-pop fusion track, which made early use of a music sequencer. &quot;Izitso&quot; reached No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, while the song &quot;(Remember the Days of the) Old Schoolyard&quot; was a top 40 hit. That same month, the Beach Boys released their album &quot;Love You&quot;, performed almost entirely by bandleader Brian Wilson with Moog and ARP synthesizers, and with arrangements somewhat inspired by Wendy Carlos&#x27;s &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; (1968). Although it was highly praised by some critics and musicians (including Patti Smith and Lester Bangs), the album met with poor commercial reception. The album has been considered revolutionary in its use of synthesizers, while others described Wilson&#x27;s extensive use of the Moog synthesizer as a &quot;loopy funhouse ambience&quot; and an early example of synth-pop.

===Origins: New wave and post-punk (1977–1980)===
Early guitar-based punk rock that came to prominence in the period 1976–77 was initially hostile to the &quot;inauthentic&quot; sound of the synthesizer, but many new wave and post-punk bands that emerged from the movement began to adopt it as a major part of their sound. British punk and new wave clubs were open to what was then considered an &quot;alternative&quot; sound. The do it yourself attitude of punk broke down the progressive rock era&#x27;s norm of needing years of experience before getting up on stage to play synthesizers. The American duo Suicide, who arose from the post-punk scene in New York, utilised drum machines and synthesizers in a hybrid between electronics and post-punk on their eponymous 1977 album. Around this time, Ultravox member Warren Cann purchased a Roland TR-77 drum machine, which was first featured in their October 1977 single release &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot;.

Be-Bop Deluxe released &quot;Drastic Plastic&quot; in February 1978, leading off with the single &quot;Electrical Language&quot; with Bill Nelson on guitar synthesizer and Andy Clark on synthesizers. Japanese band Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO) with their self-titled album (1978) and &quot;Solid State Survivor&quot; (1979), developed a &quot;fun-loving and breezy&quot; sound, with a strong emphasis on melody. They introduced the TR-808 rhythm machine to popular music, and the band would be a major influence on early British synth-pop acts.

1978 also saw the release of UK band the Human League&#x27;s debut single &quot;Being Boiled&quot; and The Normal&#x27;s &quot;Warm Leatherette&quot;, which both are regarded as seminal works in early synth-pop. Sheffield band Cabaret Voltaire are also regarded as pioneers of the late 1970s that influenced the emerging synth-pop in Britain. In America, post-punk band Devo began moving towards a more electronic sound. At this point synth-pop gained some critical attention, but made little impact on the commercial charts.

British punk-influenced band Tubeway Army, intended their debut album to be guitar driven. In late 1978, Gary Numan, a member of the group, found a minimoog left behind in the studio by another band, and started experimenting with it. This led to a change in the album&#x27;s sound to electronic new wave. Numan later described his work on this album as a guitarist playing keyboards, who turned &quot;punk songs into electronic songs&quot;. A single from the second Tubeway Army album &quot;Replicas&quot;, &quot;Are Friends Electric?&quot;, topped the UK charts in the summer of 1979. The discovery that synthesizers could be employed in a different manner from that used in progressive rock or disco, prompted Numan to go solo. On his futuristic album &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; (1979), he played only synths, but retained a bass guitarist and a drummer for the rhythm section. A single from the album, &quot;Cars&quot; topped the charts.

Numan&#x27;s main influence at the time was the John Foxx-led new wave band Ultravox who released the album &quot;Systems of Romance&quot; in 1978. Foxx left Ultravox the following year and scored a synth-pop hit with the single &quot;Underpass&quot; from his first solo album &quot;Metamatic&quot; in early 1980.

In 1979, OMD released their debut single &quot;Electricity&quot;, which has been viewed as integral to the rise of synth-pop. This was followed by a series of landmark releases within the genre, including the 1980 hit singles &quot;Messages&quot; and &quot;Enola Gay&quot;. OMD became one of the most influential acts of the period, introducing the &quot;synth duo&quot; format to British music. Vince Clarke, who co-founded the popular synth-pop groups Depeche Mode, Erasure, Yazoo and the Assembly, has cited OMD as his inspiration to become an electronic musician. Bandleaders Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys have been described in the media as &quot;the Lennon–McCartney of synth-pop&quot;.

Giorgio Moroder collaborated with the band Sparks on their album &quot;No. 1 In Heaven&quot; (1979). That same year in Japan, the synth-pop band P-Model made its debut with the album &quot;In a Model Room&quot;. Other Japanese synth-pop groups emerging around the same time included the Plastics and Hikashu. This zeitgeist of revolution in electronic music performance and recording/production was encapsulated by then would-be record producer Trevor Horn of the Buggles in the single &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;; the song topped the UK charts in October 1979 and it also became an international hit; two years later it was the first song aired on MTV. Geoff Downes, keyboardist for the Buggles, states, &quot;When we did a rerecorded version for &quot;Top of the Pops,&quot; the Musicians’ Union bloke said, &quot;If I think you’re making strings sounds out of a synthesizer, I’m going to have you. Video Killed the Radio Star is putting musicians out of business.&quot;

1980 also saw the release of where &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; came from, the Buggles&#x27; debut album &quot;The Age of Plastic&quot;, which some writers have labeled as the first landmark of another electropop era, as well as what for many is the defining album of Devo&#x27;s career, the overtly synth-pop &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot;.

===Commercial success (1981–1985)===
The emergence of synth-pop has been described as &quot;perhaps the single most significant event in melodic music since Mersey-beat&quot;. By the 1980s synthesizers had become much cheaper and easier to use. After the definition of MIDI in 1982 and the development of digital audio, the creation of purely electronic sounds and their manipulation became much simpler. Synthesizers came to dominate the pop music of the early 1980s, particularly through their adoption by bands of the New Romantic movement. Despite synth-pop&#x27;s origins in the late 1970s among new wave bands like Tubeway Army and Devo, British journalists and music critics largely abandoned the term &quot;new wave&quot; in the early 1980s. This was in part due to the rise of new artists unaffiliated with the preceding punk/new wave era, as well as aesthetic changes associated with synth-pop&#x27;s movement into the pop mainstream. According to authors Stuart Borthwick and Ron Moy, &quot;After the monochrome blacks and greys of punk/new wave, synthpop was promoted by a youth media interested in people who wanted to be pop stars, such as Boy George and Adam Ant&quot;.

The New Romantic scene had developed in the London nightclubs Billy&#x27;s and the Blitz and was associated with bands such as Duran Duran, Visage, and Spandau Ballet. They adopted an elaborate visual style that combined elements of glam rock, science fiction and romanticism. Spandau Ballet were the first band of the movement to have a hit single as the synth-driven &quot;To Cut a Long Story Short&quot; reached number 5 on the UK Singles Chart in December 1980. Visage&#x27;s &quot;Fade to Grey&quot;, characteristic of synth-pop and a major influence on the genre, reached the top ten a few weeks later. Duran Duran have been credited with incorporating dance beats into synth-pop to produce a catchier and warmer sound, which provided them with a series of hit singles, beginning with their debut single &quot;Planet Earth&quot; and the UK top five hit &quot;Girls on Film&quot; in 1981. They would soon be followed into the British charts by a large number of bands utilising synthesizers to create catchy three-minute pop songs. In summer 1981 Depeche Mode had their first chart success with &quot;New Life&quot;, followed by the UK top ten hit &quot;Just Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot;. A new line-up for the Human League along with a new producer and a more commercial sound led to the album &quot;Dare&quot; (1981), which produced a series of hit singles. These included &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot;, which reached number one in the UK at the end of 1981.

Synth-pop reached its commercial peak in the UK in the winter of 1981–2, with bands such as OMD, Japan, Ultravox, Soft Cell, Depeche Mode, Yazoo and even Kraftwerk, enjoying top ten hits. The Human League&#x27;s and Soft Cell&#x27;s UK number one singles &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot; and &quot;Tainted Love&quot; became the best selling singles in the UK in 1981. In early 1982 synthesizers were so dominant that the Musicians&#x27; Union attempted to limit their use. By the end of 1982, these acts had been joined in the charts by synth-based singles from Thomas Dolby, Blancmange, and Tears for Fears. Bands such as Simple Minds also adopted synth-pop into their music on their 1982 album &quot;New Gold Dream (81–82–83–84)&quot;. ABC and Heaven 17 had commercial success mixing synth-pop with influences from funk and soul music.

Dutch entertainer Taco, who has a background in musical theatre, released his own synth-driven re-imagining of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz&quot;; resulting in a subsequent long-play, &quot;After Eight&quot;, a concept album that takes music of 1930s sensibilities as informed by the soundscape of 1980s technology. The proliferation of acts led to an anti-synth backlash, with groups including Spandau Ballet, Human League, Soft Cell and ABC incorporating more conventional influences and instruments into their sounds.
In the US (unlike the UK), where synth-pop is sometimes considered a &quot;subgenre&quot; of &quot;new wave&quot; and was described as &quot;technopop&quot; or &quot;electropop&quot; by the press at the time, the genre became popular due to the cable music channel MTV, which reached the media capitals of New York City and Los Angeles in 1982. It made heavy use of style-conscious New Romantic synth-pop acts, with &quot;I Ran (So Far Away)&quot; (1982) by A Flock of Seagulls generally considered the first hit by a British act to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; top ten as a result of exposure through video. The switch to a &quot;new music&quot; format in US radio stations was also significant in the success of British bands. Reaching No. 2 in the UK in March 1983 and No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 six months later, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called Eurythmics&#x27; single &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; &quot;a synth-pop masterpiece&quot;. Bananarama&#x27;s 1983 synth-pop song &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; became an instant UK hit before having similar success in the US the following year. The success of synth-pop and other British acts would be seen as a Second British Invasion. In his early 1980s columns for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, music critic Robert Christgau frequently referred to British synth-pop as &quot;Anglodisco&quot;, suggesting a parallel to the contemporary genres of Eurodisco and Italo disco, both highly popular outside the US. Indeed, synth-pop was taken up across the world alongside the continuing presence of disco, with international hits for German synth-pop as well as Eurodisco acts including Peter Schilling, Sandra, Modern Talking, Propaganda, and Alphaville. Other non-British groups scoring synth-pop hits were Men Without Hats and Trans-X from Canada, Telex from Belgium, Yello from Switzerland, and Azul y Negro from Spain. The synth-pop scene of Yugoslavia spawned a large number of acts, a number of them enjoying huge mainstream popularity in the country, like Beograd, Laki Pingvini, Denis &amp; Denis, and Videosex.
In the mid-1980s, key artists included solo performer Howard Jones, who S.T. Erlewine has stated to have &quot;merged the technology-intensive sound of new wave with the cheery optimism of hippies and late-&#x27;60s pop&quot;, (although with notable exceptions including the lyrics of &quot;What Is Love?&quot; – &quot;Does anybody love anybody anyway?&quot;) and Nik Kershaw, whose &quot;well-crafted synth-pop&quot; incorporated guitars and other more traditional pop influences that particularly appealed to a teen audience. Pursuing a more dance-orientated sound were Bronski Beat whose album &quot;The Age of Consent&quot; (1984), dealing with issues of homophobia and alienation, reached the top 20 in the UK and top 40 in the US. and Thompson Twins, whose popularity peaked in 1984 with the album &quot;Into the Gap&quot;, which reached No.1 in the UK and the US top ten and spawned several top ten singles. In 1984, Frankie Goes to Hollywood released their debut album &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; (produced by Trevor Horn of the Buggles), with their first three singles, &quot;Relax&quot;, &quot;Two Tribes&quot; and &quot;The Power of Love&quot;, topping the UK chart. The music journalist Paul Lester reflected, &quot;no band has dominated a 12-month period like Frankie ruled 1984&quot;. In January 1985, Tears for Fears&#x27; single &quot;Shout&quot;, written by Roland Orzabal in his &quot;front room on just a small synthesizer and a drum machine&quot;, became their fourth top 5 UK hit; it would later top the charts in multiple countries including the US. Initially dismissed in the music press as a &quot;teeny bop sensation&quot; were Norwegian band a-ha, whose use of guitars and real drums produced an accessible form of synth-pop, which, along with an MTV friendly video, took their 1985 single &quot;Take On Me&quot; to number two in the UK and number one in the US.

===Declining popularity (1986–2000)===

Synth-pop continued into the late 1980s, with a format that moved closer to dance music, including the work of acts such as British duos Pet Shop Boys, Erasure and the Communards. The Communards&#x27; major hits were covers of disco classics &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot; (1986) and &quot;Never Can Say Goodbye&quot; (1987). After adding other elements to their sound, and with the help of a gay audience, several synth-pop acts had success on the US dance charts. Among these were American acts Information Society (who had two top 10 singles in 1988), Anything Box, and Red Flag. British band When in Rome scored a hit with their debut single &quot;The Promise&quot;. Several German synth-pop acts of the late 1980s included Camouflage and Celebrate the Nun. Canadian duo Kon Kan had major success with their debut single, &quot;I Beg Your Pardon&quot; in 1989.

An American backlash against European synth-pop has been seen as beginning in the mid-1980s with the rise of heartland rock and roots rock. In the UK the arrival of indie rock bands, particularly the Smiths, has been seen as marking the end of synth-driven pop and the beginning of the guitar-based music that would dominate rock into the 1990s. By 1991, in the United States synth-pop was losing its commercial viability as alternative radio stations were responding to the popularity of grunge. Exceptions that continued to pursue forms of synth-pop or rock in the 1990s were Savage Garden, the Rentals and the Moog Cookbook. Electronic music was also explored from the early 1990s by indietronica bands like Stereolab, EMF, the Utah Saints, and Disco Inferno, who mixed a variety of indie and synthesizer sounds.

===21st-century revival (2000s–present)===
Indietronica began to take off in the new millennium as the new digital technology developed, with acts such as Broadcast from the UK, Justice from France, Lali Puna from Germany, and Ratatat and the Postal Service from the US, mixing a variety of indie sounds with electronic music, largely produced on small independent labels. Similarly, the electroclash subgenre began in New York at the end of the 1990s, combining synth-pop, techno, punk and performance art. It was pioneered by I-F with their track &quot;Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass&quot; (1998), and pursued by artists including Felix da Housecat, Peaches, Chicks on Speed, and Fischerspooner. It gained international attention at the beginning of the new millennium and spread to scenes in London and Berlin, but rapidly faded as a recognizable genre as acts began to experiment with a variety of forms of music.

In the new millennium, renewed interest in electronic music and nostalgia for the 1980s led to the beginnings of a synth-pop revival, with acts including Adult and Fischerspooner. Between 2003 and 2004, it began to move into the mainstream with Ladytron, the Postal Service, Cut Copy, the Bravery and the Killers all producing records that incorporated vintage synthesizer sounds and styles that contrasted with the dominant genres of post-grunge and nu metal. In particular, the Killers enjoyed considerable airplay and exposure and their debut album &quot;Hot Fuss&quot; (2004) reached the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The Killers, the Bravery and the Stills all left their synth-pop sound behind after their debut albums and began to explore classic 1970s rock, but the style was picked up by a large number of performers, particularly female solo artists. Following the breakthrough success of Lady Gaga with her single &quot;Just Dance&quot; (2008), the British and other media proclaimed a new era of female synth-pop stars, citing artists such as Little Boots, La Roux, and Ladyhawke. Male acts that emerged in the same period include Calvin Harris, Empire of the Sun, Frankmusik, Hurts, Ou Est Le Swimming Pool, Kaskade, LMFAO, and Owl City, whose single &quot;Fireflies&quot; (2009) topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. In 2009, an underground subgenre with direct stylistic origins to synth-pop became popular, chillwave. Other 2010s synth-pop acts include the Naked and Famous, Chvrches, M83, and Shiny Toy Guns.

American singer Kesha has also been described as an electropop artist, with her electropop debut single &quot;Tik Tok&quot; topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for nine weeks in 2010. She also used the genre on her comeback single &quot;Die Young&quot;. Mainstream female recording artists who have dabbled in the genre in the 2010s include Madonna, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Jessie J, Christina Aguilera, and Beyoncé.

In Japan, girl group Perfume, along with producer Yasutaka Nakata of Capsule, produced technopop music combining 1980s synth-pop with chiptunes and electro house from 2003. Their breakthrough came in 2008 with the album &quot;Game&quot;, which led to a renewed interest in technopop within mainstream Japanese pop music. Other Japanese female technopop artists soon followed, including Aira Mitsuki, immi, Mizca, SAWA, Saori Rinne and Sweet Vacation. Model-singer Kyary Pamyu Pamyu also shared the same success as Perfume&#x27;s under Nakata&#x27;s production with the album &quot;Pamyu Pamyu Revolution&quot; in 2012, which topped electronic charts on iTunes as well as the Japanese Albums chart. Much like Japan, Korean pop music has also become dominated by synth-pop, particularly with girl groups such as f(x), Girls&#x27; Generation and Wonder Girls.

In 2020, the genre experienced a resurgence in popularity as 1980s-style synth-pop and synthwave songs from singers such as the Weeknd who gained success on international music charts. &quot;Blinding Lights&quot;, a synthwave song by the Weeknd, peaked at number one in 29 countries, including the United States, in early 2020; and later became the &quot;Billboard&quot; number-one greatest song of all time in November 2021. This wave of revival not only popularized established acts but also enabled new artists like Dua Lipa, whose retro-influenced album &quot;Future Nostalgia&quot; won multiple awards and was hailed for its energetic embrace of vintage pop sounds. Meanwhile, indie artists such as M83 continued to explore the boundaries of the genre, blending it with shoegaze and ambient music to create a complex, layered sound in their album &quot;Digital Shades Vol. 2&quot;. The genre&#x27;s adaptability and nostalgic appeal have contributed to its enduring presence and continued evolution in the music industry.

==Criticism and controversy==

Synth-pop has received considerable criticism and even prompted hostility among musicians and in the press. It has been described as &quot;anaemic&quot; and &quot;soulless&quot;. Synth-pop&#x27;s early steps, and Gary Numan in particular, were also disparaged in the British music press of the late 1970s and early 1980s for their German influences and characterised by journalist Mick Farren as the &quot;Adolf Hitler Memorial Space Patrol&quot;. In 1983, Morrissey of the Smiths stated that &quot;there was nothing more repellent than the synthesizer&quot;. During the decade, objections were raised to the quality of compositions and what was called the limited musicianship of artists. Gary Numan observed &quot;hostility&quot; and what he felt was &quot;ignorance&quot; regarding synth-pop, such as his belief that people &quot;thought machines did it&quot;.

OMD frontman Andy McCluskey recalled a great many people &quot;who thought that the equipment wrote the song for you&quot;, and asserted: &quot;Believe me, if there was a button on a synth or a drum machine that said &#x27;hit single&#x27;, I would have pressed it as often as anybody else would have – &quot;but there isn&#x27;t&quot;. It was all written by real human beings&quot;.

According to Simon Reynolds, in some quarters synthesizers were seen as instruments for &quot;effete poseurs&quot;, in contrast to the phallic guitar. The association of synth-pop with an alternative sexuality was reinforced by the images projected by synth-pop stars, who were seen as gender bending, including Phil Oakey&#x27;s asymmetric hair and use of eyeliner, Marc Almond&#x27;s &quot;pervy&quot; leather jacket, skirt wearing by figures including Martin Gore of Depeche Mode and the early &quot;dominatrix&quot; image of the Eurythmics&#x27; Annie Lennox. In the U.S. this led to British synth-pop artists being characterised as &quot;English haircut bands&quot; or &quot;art fag&quot; music, though many British synth-pop artists were highly popular on both American radio and MTV. Although some audiences were overtly hostile to synth-pop, it achieved an appeal among those alienated from the dominant heterosexuality of mainstream rock culture, particularly among gay, female and introverted audiences.

==Influence and legacy==
By the mid-1980s, synth-pop had helped establish the synthesizer as a primary instrument in mainstream pop music. It also influenced the sound of many mainstream rock acts, such as Bruce Springsteen, ZZ Top and Van Halen. It was a major influence on house music, which grew out of the post-disco dance club culture of the early 1980s as some DJs attempted to make the less pop-oriented music that also incorporated influences from Latin soul, dub, rap music, and jazz.

American musicians such as Juan Atkins, using names including Model 500, Infinity and as part of Cybotron, developed a style of electronic dance music influenced by synth-pop and funk that led to the emergence of Detroit techno in the mid-1980s. The continued influence of 1980s synth-pop could be seen in various incarnations of 1990s dance music, including trance. Hip hop artists such as Mobb Deep have sampled 1980s synth-pop songs. Popular artists such as Rihanna, UK stars Jay Sean and Taio Cruz, as well as British pop star Lily Allen on her second album, have also embraced the genre.

On September 10, 1969 Police Chief Thomas P. Reilly and Patrolman Robert A. Mumford were shot on Route 5 and Sherrill Road when questioning a man about a $500 holdup of a gas station in Canastota, NY. Martin J. Fitzpatrick killed Patrolman Mumford that day and Chief Reilly died 3 days later.

<text>Waterville (called Ska-na-wis, &quot;long swamp&quot; by the Haudenosaunee) is a village in Oneida County, New York, United States. According to the 2020 census, its population was 1,473.

== History ==
Long the traditional territory of the Iroquoian-speaking Oneida people of the Haudenosaunee, the Waterville area was first settled by European Americans &quot;circa&quot; 1792 after the United States&#x27; victory in the American Revolutionary War. The US forced the Iroquois Confederacy to cede most of its land in New York state. The settlement was known as &quot;The Huddle&quot;. In 1808, the settlement formally took the name of Waterville. The village is named after Waterville, Maine.

Hops &quot;(humulus lupulus)&quot; were introduced to the area in about 1820; by 1875, Waterville was considered the &quot;Hops Capital of the World.&quot; Several inventions related to the cultivation and curing of hops were developed locally, the most important of which was liquid hop extract. The International Hop Stock Exchange was established in the 1860s.
With the introduction of railway service in 1867, chiefly the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, Waterville became a major shipping point for hops-related cargo; &quot;Waterville Hops&quot; and hop extract were shipped to brewers all over the world. The economic prosperity fueled by the hop industry was reflected by merchants building fine Victorian-style homes. By the 1920s, hop production began to wane, due primarily to poor agricultural technology. By the close of the 1940s, Waterville&#x27;s working hop farms had all been converted to other uses. Some locals continue to grow hops as a recreational &quot;tip of the hat&quot; to Waterville&#x27;s past.

The Loomis Gang, a notorious group of horse thieves, lived and operated in the Waterville area during the mid-nineteenth century. Beyond documented history, there is much folklore associated with the Loomis family, including legends of ghosts that haunt the Nine Mile Swamp area located one mile south of Waterville.

Also of interest is the former home of George Eastman, the father of the Kodak Company. Kodak made, and continues to make, high-quality cameras and accessories. The parking lot across from St. Bernard&#x27;s Church is the approximate site of Eastman&#x27;s former residence.

<text>Whitesboro is a village in Oneida County, New York, United States. The population was 3,772 at the 2010 census. The village is named after Hugh White, an early settler.

The Village of Whitesboro is inside the Town of Whitestown.

==History== 
The village began to be settled in 1784, and was incorporated in 1813. An 1851 list gave the name &quot;Che-ga-quat-ka&quot; for Whitesboro in a language of the Iroquois people.

The abolitionist Oneida Institute (1827–1843) was located in Whitesboro.
The older part of the village was bordered by the Erie Canal and the village&#x27;s Main Street. When the canal was filled in the first half of the 20th century, Oriskany Boulevard was built over the filled-in canal. The streets that connect the two roads form the oldest part of the village.

The Whitestown Town Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It currently serves as the village courthouse, while offices for the Town of Whitestown are housed in newer buildings outside of Whitesboro.

===Village seal controversy===

The Whitesboro seal, originating in the early 1900s, displays founder Hugh White wrestling an Oneida Native American. The seal has been controversial because it has been interpreted as a settler choking the Native American; city officials contend it depicts a friendly wrestling match that White won, gaining the respect of the Oneida. The 1970-2017 version of the seal was created after a lawsuit by a Native American group: the version used before the suit showed the settler&#x27;s hands on the Native American&#x27;s neck instead of his shoulders. In 1999, Mayor John Malecki suggested a contest for a new seal, but received no submissions.

The seal received attention in 2015 as part of national discussion about display of the Confederate flag. In January 2016, the town cooperated with Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Show&quot; to hold a non-binding vote for a new village seal. Many of the alternative seals were humorous, including one depicting the two men as luchadores and another depicting an arm wrestling contest. Village residents voted 157 to 55 to keep the seal as-is. Afterwards, Mayor Patrick O&#x27;Connor was criticized for not disclosing Comedy Central&#x27;s involvement. &quot;The Daily Show&quot;&#x27;s January 21 show covered the vote and the controversy around the seal. At the end of the segment, correspondent Jessica Williams announced that the mayor told her that the town would change the seal. This was confirmed by a joint press release from Whitesboro and the Oneida Indian Nation the next day.

An updated seal was adopted in the summer of 2017. The new seal was created by a communication design student at PrattMWP in Utica, under direction of a professor there. While the new seal depicts the same scene as the previous seal, it moves White&#x27;s hands down to the Oneida chief&#x27;s upper arms instead of near his neck, and neither man appears to be dominating the other. Additionally, both men were given more realistic skin tones, and their attire was corrected for historical accuracy.

<text>Baldwinsville is a village in Onondaga County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 7,898. It is part of the Syracuse Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is often referred to by those in the area as &quot;B’ville&quot;. 

Baldwinsville (the village itself) is located in the towns of Lysander and Van Buren, astride the Seneca River. Baldwinsville mailing addresses also include a small northwestern section of the town of Clay.

== History ==

The village is named after Dr. Jonas Baldwin, who built a dam across the Seneca River to generate energy and a private canal to keep the integrity of the water highway. It incorporated in 1848 as the Village of Baldwinsville. Prior to this, the community was known by a number of other names, including McHarrie&#x27;s Rifts.

Baldwinsville initially grew as a local center for a prosperous farming area, with numerous mills along the north and south shores of the Seneca River. A canal on the north shore of the river allowed boats to navigate around the dam. In the early 1900s this canal was superseded with the construction of the New York State Barge Canal on the south shore of the river. In the early 1900s the village was also served by the Erie Lackawanna Railway, connecting Baldwinsville to the cities of Syracuse and Oswego. 

In addition to agriculture, Baldwinsville had small factories, such as Morris Machine Works, Jardine Bronze Foundry, and others. A large brewery now owned by Anheuser-Busch was constructed immediately east of the village in the mid-1970s to take advantage of ample water supplies from Lake Ontario. As agriculture and industry have receded, Baldwinsville has evolved into an attractive riverside community.

Grace Episcopal Church, formerly of Elizabeth Street, was one of the first churches in the United States to use electric lighting.

Dozens of local farm boys are listed on the Civil War monument in the village cemetery along the Seneca River, having served and died in several units of the Union Army. Those listed on this monument served under General John A. Logan as part of William T. Sherman&#x27;s army. Other units included 1st Regiment, Light Artillery, N. Y. S. Volunteers, Battery B (Pettit&#x27;s Battery) which fought at many major battles, including:

* Antietam, Md. September 15–17, 1862.
* Battle of Fredericksburg December 12–17, 1862.
* Battle of Chancellorsville May 1–3, 1863.
* Battle of Gettysburg July 2–3, 1863.
* Battle of Spotsylvania May 12, 1864.
* Petersburg, Virginia June 16–20, 1864.

The Baldwinsville Village Hall, Mrs. I. L. Crego House, and Oswego-Oneida Streets Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Government ==
The mayor is Bruce Stebbins and the deputy mayor is Megan O’Donnell. The Board of trustees includes Mayor Bruce Stebbins, Ruth Cico, Megan O&#x27;Donnell, Mike Shepard, Nathan Collins, Eric Reinagel, and Donna Freyleue.

== Education ==
It is within the Baldwinsville Central School District. The district has one high school (C.W. Baker High School), one middle school (Donald S. Ray Middle School), one junior high school (Theodore R. Durgee Junior High School), and five elementary schools (Harry E. Elden, Catherine McNamara, L. Pearl Palmer, Mae E. Reynolds and Martin Van Buren).

A number of parochial schools are also located there. Baldwinsville Christian Academy, a private Christian school, is located just outside the village on Van Buren Rd. Another Private Christian School, Word of Life Christian Academy is located in the Village on East Oneida Street.

== Culture ==

Several community festivals are held each year. The Baldwinsville Oktoberfest, a festival that celebrates the village and surrounding community is held every September to raise funds for a variety of not-for-profit causes in the Baldwinsville community. 

The Rotary Club organizes the Seneca River Days festival (formerly the John McHarrie Day festival) occurs in June; it features an &quot;anything that floats race&quot;, which encourages entrants to build a floating vehicle without spending more than a set amount (currently $50). Many functions are held at the amphitheater on Paper Mill Island. 

There have been several local, regional and national bands playing on weekends throughout the summer months. A 9/11 memorial was completed and presented to the community on the 10 year anniversary of the September 11 attacks in New York City.

== Geography ==

Baldwinsville is located at (43.1599, -76.3346). The village is located on the Seneca River, which flows through the village, through the historic downtown area and forms a section of the Erie Canal. Its 24th lock sports a local restaurant which is popular for guests.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and (5.23%) is water.

Baldwinsville is located on gently rolling hills, nearby Lake Ontario and the Finger Lakes. It lies in a transitional zone between the nearly flat plain immediately adjacent to Lake Ontario, and the hills to the south that form the approaches to the Allegheny Mountains of southern New York and northern Pennsylvania. This rolling glacial terrain is intersected and divided by forests, meadows, farmland, and bodies of water of all types, which is marked by significant seasonal variations. Local soils are a rich and varied blend, with deposits of gravels, sands, and rock flour, ground up and tilled by the glaciers, and left behind as they receded to the north. As is typical of the Great Lakes plains, these varied soils and gentle slopes create ideal conditions for specialty agriculture, orchards, and vegetable farming. The &quot;lake effect&quot; moderates the harsh Arctic winters found on the north side of Lake Ontario, but this comes at a price. Snowfall in the region is the highest for any metropolitan area in the United States. High average rainfall and snowfall result in abundant water resources.

Baldwinsville is in a region of rivers, lakes, streams, swamps, marshes, creeks, and ponds. Local forests, while predominantly hardwoods such as Sugar Maple, are also widely variable due to the variations in soil, drainage, and microclimate. Nearly every tree species found in the northeastern United States can be found in the forests near Baldwinsville. Wildlife is abundant, and many varieties of fish are found in the local waters in the Seneca River. Because the Seneca River flows to Lake Ontario by way of the Oswego River, the introduction of the invasive zebra mussel by international shipping in the Great Lakes has had significant ecological effects on the river, for example, a dramatic improvement in clarity and a consequent flourishing of aquatic vegetation along the banks.

The village was incorporated in 1881 and population peaked in the early 1960s, with a 1960 census reported population of 4,708.

==History==

The original inhabitants of the area were Onondaga clans, whose village was atop a hill on the eastern border of Onondaga territory along what is now Kinne St. An established trail ran down part of what is now James Street to Ley Creek where the Onondagas could travel by canoe to their capital along the northeast shore of Onondaga Lake. Portions of this Onondaga village dating from the early eighteenth century were uncovered in the 1930s when East Syracuse High School was being built on Kinne St near James St.

The current settlement, originally named &quot;Messina,&quot; grew up along the northern edge of the Erie Canal across from Headson&#x27;s Landing, a busy canal port with the only bridge to cross the canal east of downtown Syracuse for ten miles. In the middle of the nineteenth century the Messina Plank Road (now New York State Route 290) was built from Messina east to Manlius Center and the canal port there. Large venetian blind and buggy whip factories operated in Messina in the late nineteenth century.

In the 1870s, the main line of the New York Central Railroad was built through the northern part of Messina. The DeWitt Railyards complex, one of the busiest in the world in its day, stretched from Messina five miles east to Minoa. East and westbound trains were assembled in the yards at the &quot;Hump&quot;, where trains were pushed up tracks on one side of an artificial hill and routed to their train by track switches as the rolled freely down the far side. During most of the nineteenth century the larger part of the hamlet was south of the railroad yards, but as the population grew with rail workers, housing expanded to the north.

During the boom following construction of the railroad, the name &quot;East Syracuse&quot; began to replace Messina. That name was chosen for the new village when it was incorporated in 1881. At that time the village thrived due to its access to transportation. The railroad was the new powerhouse, but the canal remained viable, with Headson&#x27;s Landing still a busy port. The northeastern corner of the Headson&#x27;s Landing Bridge was the original southwestern corner of the village.

In the 20th century, Erie Boulevard was built over the canal from west of Syracuse to about a mile past Headson&#x27;s landing. In the 1960s, Interstate 690 was built through the southern part of the village between the railroad and Erie Blvd. Now only a small portion of the original settlement south of the railroad remains, including about 100 of the village&#x27;s 1400 dwelling units.

With the canal gone and the railroad seeing only a portion of its former business, and as the interstate system and other high speed roads have turned the all-day trip of the nineteenth century into a few hours&#x27; drive, East Syracuse has become fully a suburb of Syracuse.

East Syracuse is home to Bristol Laboratories, formerly Cheplin Laboratories, which Bristol-Myers purchased in 1943 and converted from the production of acidophilus milk to penicillin until 2005 when it became more economical to produce overseas. Now a division of Bristol-Myers Squibb, the facility makes several newer drugs, along with housing a state-of-the-art ramp-up facility designed to quickly adapt to make moderate quantities of new drugs for clinical trials.

Jason M Rhoades became the village&#x27;s youngest mayor at the age of twenty-five.

The Brockway Tavern building, located on the northwest corner of West Genesee and Onondaga, formerly housed a tavern, motor inn, restaurants and later a funeral home, and now houses a credit union. The house was built c. 1808 and survives as one of the oldest structures in the hamlet. The oldest house still used as a residence dates from 1876.

Previously known as Tyler or Jeromeville, the area became formally identified as Fairmount when its post office (formerly designated &quot;Tyler&quot;) was renamed on January 1, 1846. (This post office was discontinued in 1899.) Fairmount was also a minor station on the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad and its successor railroads (including the New York Central Railroad) from 1838 to the end of the 19th century. The Fairmount Farm Colony, a working farm for the vocational training of young men with intellectual disabilities, was established by the Syracuse State School north of the hamlet in 1883. Farmland in the hamlet was developed into residential tracts from the 1890s through the 1990s, with intense residential and commercial development during the 1950s and 1960s. A large area of undeveloped land, formerly used for quarrying and a munitions factory in the 19th and early 20th centuries, borders Fairmount to the south at Split Rock.

The Geddes family&#x27;s &quot;Fair Mount&quot; mansion was demolished in 1929, although a carriage house from the estate survived until 2014. Small sections of the estate&#x27;s stone fences are still standing.

In 2007, Fairmount was 27th on &quot;Newsweek&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Best Places to Raise Your Kids&quot; list.

<text>Geddes is a town in Onondaga County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 17,088.

The Town of Geddes is west of the neighborhood of Far Westside of Syracuse. The town is a western suburb of Syracuse.

== History ==
The town was formed from the Town of Salina in 1848. It is named after James Geddes, a prominent early settler who settled at the head of Onondaga Lake in 1794 and developed the salt industry.

There also was an Old Geddes Village which included part of the west side of Syracuse and Tipperary Hill, the village square being located near St. Mark&#x27;s Circle. The village of Geddes (incorporated in 1832 and 1837) was annexed to the City of Syracuse on May 20, 1886, with a population of nearly 7,000. Today the town of Geddes still includes the Village of Solvay, which operates independently, and the hamlets of Westvale and Lakeland.

Geddes is the youngest town in Onondaga County.

===Background===
Geddes was formed from Salina on March 18, 1848. It lies upon the western bank of Onondaga Lake with level surface in the north and rolling hills in the south. In the southwest of the town, are several isolated, rounded drift hills (or knolls).

The Seneca River forms the north border and Onondaga Creek formed part of the eastern boundary. Nine Mile Creek flows east through the center of town.

The soil is clay and sandy loam. In 1859, the town contained two churches, both Protestant, an Episcopalian and Methodist Episcopalian.

===Early industry===
By 1859, several salt wells were located near the southwest extremity of the lake. The S.B.&amp; N.Y.R.R. coal depot was situated on the Erie Canal. In the southeast section of town, there were extensive stone quarries.

There was also a brewery and distillery, and a large number of salt works within the town limits. The population was 950.

In 1841, W. H. Farrar, who had recently arrived from Vermont, started a small pottery business in the town of Geddes, New York called Farrar Pottery. During 1868, Farrer sold the business to what later became the Empire Crockery Manufacturing Company.

On July 20, 1871, several local businessmen purchased the struggling local pottery, capitalized the company for $50,000, and expanded its lines to produce ceramic material for table and toilet use. At that time, the name changed to Onondaga Pottery Company (O.P.Co.). The company name was officially changed to Syracuse China in 1966. They specialized in the manufacture of fine china and commercial ware.

During 1874, Ashton Salt Mill was operating in the town of Geddes, on the western edge of the city and Saginaw Salt Works was located southwest of the city in the town of Onondaga. That same year, several other salt producers were operating within the city limits including; G. A. Porter &amp; Company, Haskin&#x27;s Salt Mill and J. W. Barker &amp; Company.

<text>Jordan is a village in Onondaga County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 1,192. It is part of the Syracuse Metropolitan Statistical Area. It was named after the Jordan River.

Jordan is located in the northwest part of the town of Elbridge, west of Syracuse.

== History ==
The village bloomed with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825. Due to the canal, Jordan became larger than Elbridge Village farther south. In 1835, Jordan was incorporated as a village.

In 1983, much of the village was included in the Jordan Village Historic District and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Erie Canal ==
When the Erie Canal opened in October 1825, the original route went through the middle of Jordan, along what is today Clinton and Mechanic streets, with the original lock being Lock 59 (located near the current post office).

When the Canal was expanded, straightened, and widened in the 1840s, the path of the Canal migrated to the north slightly. Lock 59 was removed with Lock 51, built to about 1 mile west of the village, replacing it. A four-arched Aqueduct was built to allow the Canal to cross over Skaneateles Creek.

The section of Canal that went through Jordan was closed in 1918 with the opening of the New York State Barge Canal that bypassed Jordan, using the natural waterway of the Seneca River north of the Village.

Today, much of the expanded Canal&#x27;s stonework is visible, with its path having been turned into a park in the middle of the Village.

== Lincoln Funeral Procession and Cannonball ==
In 1865 as the Lincoln Funeral Train passed through the village, along the New York Central Railroad, a cannonball was fired in honor of the former president. The cannonball hit an old tree standing on the farmland of Issac Otis, which survived the hit

The tree was cut down in 1935 by two men, Jerome Teachout and O. J. Conger. As the two men were clearing away the trunk, they discovered that the tree had grown around the cannonball, fully engulfing it.

In 1997, teachers Kathy Philips and Kathy Jones led their 4th grade class in researching and fundraising for a historic marker.

== Historic places and businesses ==
The Jordan Lodge 386 F. &amp; A.M., also known as the Masonic building, is located in Jordan on North Main Street. It was built in 1979. Bush Funeral Home, established in 1904, is also located on North Main Street.

==Image Gallery==
==Geography==
Jordan is located at (43.0658, -76.4729).

The village was formerly located on the Erie Canal, which has been re-routed farther north. The New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) passes north of the village, but there is no interchange at all in the town.

Skaneateles Creek flows through the village. The Jordan Aqueduct still stands where the Erie Canal crossed Skaneateles Creek.

<text>Lakeland is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in Onondaga County, New York, United States. The population was 2,786 at the 2010 census. The community name is derived from its location next to Onondaga Lake.

The community is in the northwest part of the town of Geddes.

== History ==
From the latter part of the nineteenth century through the early years of the twentieth century, Lakeland was home to several upscale hotels and a small amusement park along the shores of Onondaga Lake. These were served by a trolley car line from Syracuse. However, the resort area began to decline before World War I and was gone by the Great Depression. The former resort area is now largely covered by Interstate 690 and parking areas for the New York State Fair, whose permanent grounds are at the southern edge of Lakeland.

==1943 industrial waste flood==
On Thanksgiving Day in 1943, 40,000 tons of industrial waste consisting of calcium carbonate and magnesia flooded Lakeland. The industrial waste broke through a waste bed retaining wall at the Solvay Process Company plant. Two square miles were covered by the waste, which reached as much as eight feet deep in some places. &quot;The Post-Standard&quot; reported in 1993 that &quot;every tree, shrub or blade of grass within a square mile was dead&quot;. Parked cars were mired and flooded by the waste, including one car at the fairgrounds that was swept 1,000 feet.

All available Onondaga County Sheriff&#x27;s Office deputies, as well as nearby fire departments, Solvay police, the New York State Police, the American Red Cross, and Solvay Process crews were called in to contain the flood and rescue residents. Volunteers from the SPCA were also present to help rescue animals and livestock. The Red Cross operated a shelter at the State Fair Hotel. There were no reported fatalities, but there were a few people injured, such as an auxiliary military policeman from Solvay Process who was treated for acid burns and two frozen toes after rescuing numerous stranded residents using a rowboat. Several animals, pets, and livestock were also rescued, though a pig, several geese and ducks, and hundreds of chickens drowned in the sludge. 55 residents were left homeless as a result of the flood.

The waste was initially intended to be removed by dumping truckloads of cinders into the waste until it solidified enough to be shoveled out, but that plan was scrapped in favor of dissolving the waste using water and eventually pumping it into Ninemile Creek, which flows into Onondaga Lake. The cleanup process took two months to complete. The houses affected by the flood, now destroyed and worthless, were purchased by Solvay Process and demolished.

An investigation launched by Solvay Process into the incident reported that the dykes at the plant were built of old Solvay waste, not dirt, and that they were built too rapidly. The investigation also stated that the demand for production during World War II was too great and help was too limited. After the incident, Solvay Process moved their waste beds away from the shoreline of Onondaga Lake.

Most of the affected area is now a parking lot for the fairgrounds.

== Community ==
The community includes a few gas stations, various food outlets, two churches, a few small restaurants, a car dealership, a credit union, Solvay Middle School, a hotel, and a golf course. All are within minutes of the New York State Fair.
