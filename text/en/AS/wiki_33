The line became known as the Panhandle Route and was operated in the Pennsylvania Railroad system and currently by the Columbus and Ohio River Railroad (Ohio Central Railroad System). Tragedy struck this track on September 11, 1950, when the crack passenger train &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; hit another train carrying 600 men of the 109th Field Artillery Battalion of the Pennsylvania National Guard. 33 men were killed as a result of the accident. A memorial was placed near the site of the accident in 1990. A 105mm howitzer is at the memorial also, commemorating the manufacture of 105mm shells at Moore Enamelling across the tracks during WWII.

The village was once known as the &quot;Enamel Center of the World&quot;. Before plastics were invented, steel vessels covered with a ceramic called enamelware were the norm in American homes. In 1903 the Lafayette Stamping and Enameling Co. was founded. Moore Enameling and Jones Metal also manufactured enamelware.

The West Lafayette Homecoming was founded in 1950 and continues today as the &quot;Hometown Festival.&quot;

<text>Bucyrus ( ) is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and the county seat of Crawford County, located in northern Ohio approximately 28 miles (45 km) west of Mansfield and southeast of Toledo. The population was 11,684 at the time of the 2020 census. The city is the largest in Crawford County, and the center of the Bucyrus Micropolitan Statistical Area (as defined by the United States Census Bureau in 2003).

==History==
The origin of the name Bucyrus is not certain. It was given by James Kilbourne, who laid out the town in 1821. One theory is that the name Bucyrus is derived from &quot;beautiful&quot; coupled with the name of Cyrus the Great, founder of the First Persian Empire. An alternate theory is that the city was named after Busiris, a city of ancient Egypt.

The Bucyrus Foundry and Manufacturing Company, a predecessor to Bucyrus International, Inc. was founded in Bucyrus in 1880. The company moved to Wisconsin in 1893.

Bucyrus was once home to the Dostal Brothers Brewery. Founded in 1902, the brewery was run by John M. and George A. Dostal.

The Lincoln Highway, later US Route 30, was routed through the city along Mansfield Street in 1913. In 1971 a modern, limited-access bypass was built to the north, but the associated freeway links to the east and west of Bucyrus, replacing the old two-lane Lincoln Highway route, were not completed until 2005, nearly 35 years after they were first proposed.

Ohio Central Traction Company, an interurban line that connected the two communities of Bucyrus and Galion, developed Seccaium Park at the end of the nineteenth century.

There was a notable landmark of an Elephant with a “B” atop the Geiger Clothing store (since demolished) on Washington Square. This was to promote Geiger&#x27;s motto which was, “Buy your clothing here, for it will last like the hide of an elephant.” 

On March 10, 2007, Bucyrus was featured as the town of the week on the nationally syndicated Public Radio International program, &quot;Whad&#x27;Ya Know?&quot;. 

==Geography==

<text>Galion ( ) is a city in Crawford, Morrow, and Richland counties in the U.S. state of Ohio. The population was 10,453 at the 2020 census. Galion is the second-largest city in Crawford County after Bucyrus.

The Crawford County portion of Galion is part of the Bucyrus micropolitan statistical area. The small portion of the city that is located in Richland County is part of the Mansfield metropolitan area, while the portion extending into Morrow County is considered part of the Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area.

==History==
The region was first inhabited by Native American tribes up until the first settlers, Benjamin Leveridge and his two sons, arrived in 1817. In 1820, William Hosford and his two sons, Asa and Horace, settled on land outside of the area. It was not until Colonel James Kilbourne decided to &quot;lay out a town half way between Columbus and the Lakes&quot; that the crossroads of Portland and Main street were settled by the Hosford family. This crossing was known by various names including: Moccasin, Horseshoe, Hard Scrabble, Spang Town, Hosfords and Goshen. Galion was laid out in 1831. However, in 1824 the town petitioned for a post office using the name Goshen and later changed to Galion by the postmaster general, John McLean, due to a town already being named Goshen in Ohio. The etymology of the name Galion is uncertain. A post office called Galion has been in operation since 1825.

Asa Hosford is considered the &quot;Father of Galion&quot; due to his work as a state legislator in which he did work to get a rail line through the area that was completed in 1851.

===1882 lynching===
On April 30, 1882, in Galion, Ohio, a mob of around 2,000 people took Frank Fisher, an African American man accused of raping a white woman, from the town jail and lynched him. The mob hanged Fisher in broad daylight despite efforts by local authorities to intervene. The event was widely covered in newspapers at the time and is recognized as a tragic episode in Galion&#x27;s history.&lt;

===2005 financial scandal===
In 2005, Galion, Ohio, faced a major financial scandal when its former finance director, William Bauer, confessed to embezzling at least $87,000 from the city. Bauer’s mismanagement left the town $11 million in debt, resulting in significant cuts to city services. Programs such as the D.A.R.E. antidrug initiative were eliminated, police cruisers and computers were sold, and road projects were scrapped. Residents faced higher taxes and utility costs, while volunteers stepped in to clean parks and fund community events.

Bauer, who had been finance director since 1985, admitted to stealing money due to a gambling addiction and credit card problems. He attempted suicide before being sentenced and was blinded in the attempt. Bauer later pleaded guilty to five counts of embezzlement, avoiding a trial that would have revealed more details of his crimes. Despite his confession, questions about where the stolen funds went remained unanswered.

The State Auditor placed Galion in fiscal emergency, appointing a board to help the city recover financially, which was expected to take five years. City officials, who trusted Bauer due to his longstanding reputation, implemented new financial safeguards to prevent future fraud.

==Geography==
Galion is located in the southeastern corner of Crawford County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Galion lies just south of a continental divide. The Olentangy River begins near and runs through Galion, and then winds southward toward Columbus and eventually empties into the Scioto River, a tributary of the Ohio and thus of the Mississippi. However, Lake Galion, which lies just north of town, is part of the Sandusky River watershed, which drains via Lakes Erie and Ontario into the Saint Lawrence River.

==Economy==
The Galion brand of heavy equipment, such as road graders, road rollers, and earthmovers, was manufactured by Galion Iron Works, later purchased by Dresser Industries and then by Komatsu.

Galion was once the home of Peabody Galion, a manufacturer of sanitation equipment, primarily dump bodies, as well as front loading, side-loading and rear loading garbage trucks; rivaling the Heil Company for numbers of units sold throughout the world. For a short time, in the early 1970s, Peabody Galion maintained a manufacturing plant in Durant, Oklahoma, known as &quot;Peabody Galion, Durant Division&quot;.

Galion was also once home to North Electric Company, a prime supplier of telephone switching systems for government and international markets. It was also producer of the Ericofon, the first ever one-piece telephone designed by Ralph Lysell and Hugo Blomberg. Founded in 1884 by Charles N. North, the company became part of Ericsson in 1951. It was purchased by ITT in the mid-1970s and operated as ITT PowerSystems until the late 1980s, when it was sold to a private consortium and renamed PECO II (the name is derived from North Electric Company&#x27;s purchase of Power Equipment Company (PECO) in 1960). Peco II purchased the telecommunications product line and associated assets from ITT in 1988. In 2010, PECO II was acquired by Lineage Power of Plano, Texas and has since closed the plant.

==Arts and culture==

===Community organizations===
The Galion Community Theatre (GCT), founded in 1972, has been a cultural cornerstone of the city, offering a platform for both local talent and a broad range of theatrical performances. Located in downtown Galion, the theater operates out of a historic building that adds to the town’s charm and cultural landscape. The GCT presents a variety of productions throughout the year, including musicals, plays, and children’s theater, catering to diverse audiences.

In addition to its mainstage productions, GCT serves as an educational space, hosting workshops and classes that foster community engagement with the performing arts. These programs provide creative outlets for aspiring actors, directors, and technicians of all ages. The theater is particularly known for its role in nurturing young talent through youth programs, giving children and teens a chance to participate in live theater, both on stage and behind the scenes. The Galion Community Theatre’s impact extends beyond entertainment. It strengthens community bonds by offering residents a venue for socializing, volunteering, and participating in cultural events. Local participation is encouraged through open auditions and the involvement of volunteers in various capacities, from set design to production support. This has made the theater a vital part of Galion’s social and cultural identity. Additionally, the theater collaborates with local businesses and organizations, further embedding itself in the community by hosting special events, fundraisers, and themed performances that resonate with local traditions and causes.

The Galion History Center is a historical institution located in Galion, Ohio, dedicated to preserving and sharing the history of the city and its surrounding areas.

The cottage is built in the Gothic architectural style, and the center offers guided tours about Bishop Brown. The center also features exhibits, archives, and collections that document the industrial, social, and cultural evolution of Galion. It also hosts educational programs, special events, and community engagement activities.

===Festivals===
The Pickle Run Festival began in 1961 and was said to have been inspired &quot;when a grocer used to dump his old pickles into the Whetstone Creek behind his store and the pickles would run through the creek.&quot; The festival would include events like the Pickle Run 5k, car show, watermelon diving competition along with carnival rides and food vendors among other things. The Pickle Run did not run from 1998 up till 2015 when volunteers started the Pickle Run festival over moving the original date on Labor Day to the Fourth of July weekend.

Started by the Galion Jaycees in 1976 and later ran by the local Moose Lodge, the Galion Oktoberfest is the city&#x27;s fall festival that runs on the last weekend of September in the city&#x27;s Uptowne Business District.

===Historic landmarks===
Home of the founder of the Galion Buggy Company, the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 30, 1978 and is located on South Boston Street. The home was built in 1898 and was later owned by the Galion Historical Society and sat vacant for 50 years until its auction to Tim and Connie Musselman in 2015. The Victorian-era house designed by Vernon Redding features &quot;massive pillars on the front porch, a golden oak vestibule and carved stairs leading to a circular balustrade and ballroom, all illuminated by a stained-glass skylight.&quot;

Brownella Cottage and Grace Episcopal Church and Rectory is a historic church complex at S. Union and Walnut Streets. The site is significant for its association with Bishop William Montgomery Brown, notable as the first bishop of his communion to be tried for heresy since the Reformation and &quot;&#x27;the first of any creed in America to be deposed for heretical teaching&#x27;&quot;.

The Central Hotel is a combination of three buildings that are &quot;all that remains of Galion&#x27;s significant commercial boom in the 1860&#x27;s.&quot; The Central Hotel was registered on the National Historic Registry on Nav.13, 1976 but did not see any significant improvements until it was procured by the Ohio Capital Corporation for Housing in 2004. The non-profit led a significant restructuring and investment into the building and the building is now an affordable housing for seniors.

The Hessenauer Cabin, which is located on Cedar Point’s Frontier Trail, was originally built around 1835 near Galion, Ohio, by an early settler named Adam Rensch. This log cabin is one of the few historic structures on the Frontier Trail with a marker providing details about its origins. The cabin now serves as a Candle Shop where visitors can purchase candles and even hand-dip their own. The cabin is part of a broader effort by Cedar Point to recreate the atmosphere of early American frontier life, featuring various historic and reconstructed buildings along the Frontier Trail. While some structures on the trail are more modern recreations, the Hessenauer Cabin is notable for being an authentic historical structure, albeit retrofitted with modern amenities like electricity and an ADA access ramp.

The Hosford House was built in 1892 by Asa Hosford and listed on the National Historic Registry on April 30, 1976. Asa Hosford is considered the &quot;Father of Galion&quot; due to his work as a state legislator to get a rail line through the area that was completed in 1851.

Galion, Ohio, is home to four Lustron homes, which are notable for their unique post-World War II design. Lustron homes were prefabricated, all-metal houses produced between 1948 and 1950, designed to address the housing shortage in America after the war. Constructed from enameled steel panels, these homes were durable, low-maintenance, and featured modern conveniences for the time. The homes in Galion are part of this architectural innovation and stand as examples of mid-century modern design. Today, these Lustron homes are recognized as historically significant due to their rarity and contribution to post-war housing developments in the United States.

==Government==
The government of Galion, Ohio, operates under a mayor-council system, with the mayor acting as the city’s chief executive officer. The city council serves as the legislative branch and is composed of seven members—four representing specific wards and three at-large members representing the entire city. This structure allows for a balance between local representation and broader city-wide governance.

The city provides essential services through its various departments, including public safety, utilities, public works, and parks and recreation. The government prioritizes community engagement, with public city council meetings open to residents, ensuring transparency and allowing citizens to participate in the decision-making process. Galion’s administrative offices are located at 301 Harding Way East, and city council meetings are regularly held to address local issues.

==Education==

===Public schools===
The Galion City School District encompasses the entire city of Galion, graduating about 150 students annually. There are a handful of neighborhoods outside of Galion that are also included in the school district, including Blooming Grove. Galion High School serves students ranging from grades 9 through 12. The school colors are blue and orange and its athletic teams are known as the Tigers. The current high school building opened in 2007 following the demolition of the previous home of Galion High School on North Union Street.

The first Galion Union High School was built in 1868 on West Walnut Street and served as Galion High School until 1917. This building was demolished in 1924 and a new junior high school was built on the site in 1925, which was razed in April 2008. The second home of GHS was built in 1917 on the site of a former cemetery on North Union Street. This building was extended in 1962, adding features such as a large gymnasium. This building was in use until the end of the 2006–2007 school year, with the new Galion High School opening in late 2007.

===Library===
The Galion Public Library was formally dedicated on April 28, 1904. The &quot;purely 20th century synthesis of Greek and Roman designs&quot; was designed by Vernon Redding a prominent architect from Mansfield, Ohio that designed the Mansfield Public Library using the Galion design as a foundation. However, the organization and establishment of the current library were made from the efforts of a woman&#x27;s organization called The Current News Club. The organization pushed for the establishment of a public library and started a library fund that had been started using funds from other organizations and contributions from citizens of Galion. In 1898, a state law was passed providing for a mandatory establishment of a library through the Boards of Education in Galion due to its size. The Current News Club incorporated the Galion Public Library Association on March 26, 1901 with &quot;the purpose of building and opening a public library free to all the citizens of the Galion Public School district.&quot; The association purchased the land in which the building currently resides on North Market street for $2,850 in which &quot;the lot already had an old log residence on it, one of the oldest buildings in the city, and was one of the early school houses half a century previously.&quot; This log building, now located in Heise Park, provided for a comfortable &quot;reading room&quot; and &quot;became the pride and glory of the infant library association&quot; but quickly became too small for to serve the citizens of Galion. In February 1902 the association sent representatives to meet with Andrew Carnegie to seek financial assistance in building a new library and was approved for $15,000 with a &quot;guarantee of an annual support for the library of not less than ten percent of that amount&quot; which was later approved by the city council with a resolution that passed on April 18, 1902.

==Media==
Galion and neighboring communities are served by a semi-weekly newspaper, the &quot;Galion Inquirer&quot;. The city&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The District Democrat&quot;, was founded in 1855 and later sold and renamed &quot;The Galion Train&quot;.

Galion radio station 102.3 The Fox is a classic rock station based in Galion, Ohio. It broadcasts a wide range of rock music from the 1960s through the 1990s, catering to fans of artists like Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, and Pink Floyd. The station is popular for its mix of music and local programming, including community updates, news, and sports coverage, particularly focused on local high school sports. 102.3 The Fox also features radio personalities who engage with listeners through various on-air segments and promotions, making it a favorite for classic rock enthusiasts in the Galion and surrounding areas.

==Infrastructure==
===Healthcare===
Healthcare in Galion, Ohio, is primarily provided through a network of local clinics, hospitals, and specialized medical services. The city is served by Avita Health System, which operates Avita Galion Hospital, a full-service facility offering emergency care, surgical services, and a range of outpatient services. Avita is a key healthcare provider in the region, with additional locations in nearby towns like Bucyrus and Ontario. The hospital plays a crucial role in providing healthcare for both routine and critical needs for Galion and the surrounding areas.

Additionally, Galion has access to various healthcare clinics and specialists, offering services in family medicine, physical therapy, and mental health. The city’s healthcare system also connects with larger medical centers in nearby metropolitan areas for more specialized treatments.

===Transportation===
The Erie Railroad also ran through Galion and established large rail yards here, making the city an important rail center. In April, 1851 the Cleveland Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad, later known as the &quot;Big Four&quot; and eventually the New York Central, began operating regular service between Columbus and Cleveland, stopping at Galion along the way. Prior to the end of the 19th century, Galion became a division headquarters for the line.

Galion once boasted two large railroad depots. The Big Four Depot at 127 Washington Street served passenger trains until 1971. The Erie Depot on South Market Street, served until 1970 and the 1891 structure was demolished later that year. With the move of the Erie yards to Marion in the 1910s, the railroads declined, although the city remained a passenger rail center into the 1960s. The Big Four Depot was abandoned; however, it has since been acquired by the City of Galion and is undergoing a slow but thorough restoration.From 1915 to 1923, Galion was on the original route of the Lincoln Highway, America&#x27;s first coast-to-coast route. In later years, however, the northern route was improved and became US 30 North, although until approximately 1970 the route through Galion was designated as US 30 South. The new, four-lane US 30 opened in 2005, and passes just north of town, giving the community excellent transportation access.

State routes in Galion include 309, which connects Marion to the southwest with Ontario to the east; 598, which originates in Galion and stretches northward; 19, which heads westward toward the county seat and also south toward Williamsport; 61, which goes south towards Morrow and Delaware Counties and north to Lake Erie, and 97, which goes east through Lexington.

<doc id="129069" wikidata="Q812092" url="?curid=129069" title="Bay Village, Ohio">
<text>Bay Village is a city in western Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. Located along the southern shore of Lake Erie, the city is a western suburb of Cleveland and a part of the Cleveland metropolitan area. The population was 16,163 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Before the first European-Americans arrived in the area around 1600, Erie Indians lived in Bay Village and the surrounding areas. The most important Indian trail in Ohio is present-day Lake Road, which is a main road in Bay Village. In that same century, what is now Bay Village, along with Avon Lake, Avon, and Westlake, was part of one territory. This territory was later called by the whites in a native language, &quot;Xeuma&quot;, a term roughly meaning &quot;those who came before us&quot;.

The area belonged to Connecticut until 1803, the year in which Ohio became a state. Before 1803, the Connecticut Land Company sold and gave away land in the area to Connecticut citizens, who had lost their homes and farms during the Revolutionary War. Because many had lost their homes to fires during the war, this new area was named &quot;the Firelands&quot;. One surveyor with the Connecticut Land Company was Moses Cleaveland. He came with his friends on horseback from Connecticut and stopped at the Cuyahoga River with his Indian guides in July 1796. The land was then divided into five townships. The area between the Cuyahoga River and The Firelands to the west was laid out in 1806. 
Joseph Cahoon settled in what is now Bay Village in 1810. Bay Village was part of the original Dover Township, which comprised present-day Bay Village, Westlake, and portions of North Olmsted. By the turn of the 20th century, Dover would have a permanent population of roughly 2,200, with wealthy part-time residents who owned summer cottages on Lake Erie adding to this total in the summer months. In 1901, landowners in northern Dover forced an election to split from Dover Township, forming Bay Township. In 1903, Bay Village was incorporated, and the first mayor and council were elected. Ida Marie Cahoon, the last Cahoon descendant, died in 1917, leaving the family home and 115 acres of land to the city which is known today as Cahoon Memorial Park. John Huntington, one of the original partners of Standard Oil Company, donated his summer estate to the Cleveland Metroparks, which would later become the Huntington Reservation. Bay Village became a city on January 1, 1950, when it had reached a population of 6,917.

With decades of growth starting in the 1930s, Bay Village became a prominent Cleveland suburb. Today, it is characterized by tree-lined streets of craftsman, Cape Cod, Tudor, and colonial style homes, as well as mansions along the Lake Erie shoreline.

On August 6, 2024, Bay Village was hit by two EF-1 Tornadoes of five total in the greater Cleveland area, it left large parts of the area without power.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

Bay Village is home to the Cleveland Metroparks Huntington Reservation. Lake Erie Nature &amp; Science Center and BAYarts are also located within the reservation. Bay Village is located in Ohio&#x27;s 7th congressional district.

<text>Beachwood is a city in eastern Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. As of the 2020 census the city&#x27;s population was 14,040. A suburb of Cleveland, it is a part of the Cleveland metropolitan area.

==History==
The land that eventually became Beachwood was originally part of the Connecticut Western Reserve. Before becoming an independent municipality, Beachwood was part of Warrensville Township. In 1915, it seceded from Warrensville after the Township voted to close a nearby area school. A petition was organized, and on June 26, 1915, Beachwood was incorporated into an independent village. In 1960, Beachwood had reached the number of residents to attain city status under the Ohio Revised Code.

Beachwood was named for the numerous Beech trees that grew throughout the village. The origin of the spelling of the city is disputed. Upon incorporation, the city&#x27;s name was originally spelled &quot;Beechwood&quot;. One popular theory is that an early village hall clerk misspelled the name on some official documents, giving rise to the current spelling.

In 1948, a village wide debate was sparked after the proposal of the construction of the Anshe Chesed Fairmount Temple following the purchase of 32 acres of land on which the temple currently stands. The debate started due to the growing trend of families moving to the suburbs due to the booming post WWII economy. Considering that Beachwood at the time was a small community with few Jews, the sudden proposal of the large synagogue of 1,800 families sparked anti-Semitic worries among the village&#x27;s community due to the imminent demographics change that the establishment of a large synagogue would bring. The village council, no member of which was Jewish, cited in 1952 that the establishment of Anshe Chesed &quot;would be detrimental to the public safety, welfare, and convenience of the village&quot;. One morning in May 1952, following Anshe Chesed&#x27;s threat to sue the village of Beachwood, residents opened their mailboxes and found a white supremacist newspaper called &quot;The Plain Truth,&quot; with the message: 
Zoning arguments between the village and the congregation regarding the temple&#x27;s construction led to the Ohio Supreme Court ruling in 1954 that the synagogue must be allowed to be built, as well as issuing state building permits to the congregation. The temple&#x27;s construction was finished in 1957.

Since the late 1950s, multiple other synagogues relocated to Beachwood, establishing the Jewish influence on the growth of the community.

===Jewish community===

Since its development in the 1950s, Beachwood has been a destination for the Jewish community in the Greater Cleveland area. Following WWII, Jewish families from inner city neighborhoods such as Glenville began relocating to established communities in the city&#x27;s eastern suburbs. In 2017, with approximately 90% of the Beachwood&#x27;s population identifying as Jewish, the city had the fourth largest per capita Jewish population of any municipality outside of Israel. Beachwood&#x27;s Jewish establishment is rooted in decades of development of various Jewish institutions, such as synagogues, Jewish schools, The Maltz Museum of Jewish Heritage, Menorah Park Center for Assisted Living, the Mandel Jewish Community Center, Young Israel of Greater Cleveland, the Beachwood Kehilla, Green Road Synagogue, the Jewish Federation of Cleveland, and many Jewish owned restaurants, stores and other businesses. Beachwood&#x27;s rapid growth from village to city status is attributed to the influx of Jewish families seeking suburban homes, naturally forming an ethnic enclave. Most of the homes built in Beachwood between the 1940s and the 1990s were developed by Jewish owned companies, down to the lumber used to build the structures themselves. Beachwood&#x27;s Jewish community is also reflected in the city&#x27;s public schools, with Hebrew being offered as a foreign language at the local Middle and High School, making Beachwood one of the only public schools in the United States to do so.

<text>Bedford is a city in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. The population was 13,149 at the 2020 census. It is an eastern suburb of Cleveland.

==History==
The area that is now Bedford and northeastern Ohio was originally inhabited by Native Americans as early as 11,000 years ago. By 1662 the area was declared a part of the Connecticut Colony through royal charter. Much of the colony&#x27;s land, which extended to the Pacific Ocean, was ceded to the early U.S. government, but a few million acres west of the border of Pennsylvania became what was known as the Western Reserve.

Bedford began as part of the Connecticut Western Reserve in 1797. A large portion of the Western Reserve was sold to the Connecticut Land Company in 1795. Surveying of the land began shortly after and was spearheaded by Moses Cleaveland. Seth Pease and Amzi Atwater surveyed Lot 46, which eventually would become Bedford Township. It was surveyed as township 6, range 11.

The first settlers to the area started to arrive in 1813. Early settlers to the region were drawn to Tinkers Creek and the hardwood forests. Waterfalls on Tinkers Creek were ideal for mills, which would power local businesses. The first mill in Bedford Township was built by Adams and Starr in 1815. It was situated at the mouth of Tinkers Creek. The first official settler to the area was Elijah Nobles. He settled here in 1810 in the western part of the township on one of the 100 lots surveyed.

More settlers followed, including Benjamin Franklin Fitch, who founded the Taylor Chair Company in 1816. He began making chairs at his home, which was located at Warrensville Center and Libby Roads in present-day Maple Heights, Ohio. The company did not close until 2012, making it the longest-running manufacturing company in the Western Reserve area. Fitch made chairs that were considered to be better than others because of his use of pre-shrunk wood that prevented creaking. He is also known for inventing the strap lathe, a tool that would become standard in furniture making.

Bedford Township was officially founded in 1823 and Township 6 was renamed Bedford Township by Daniel Benedict, originally a native of Bedford, New York. The original township covered what today includes Bedford, Bedford Heights, Maple Heights, Oakwood Village, and Walton Hills.

In 1834, the First Baptist Church was established to help meet the religious needs of the growing population in the area. The first church in Bedford was the First Baptist Church, founded with just 14 original members at the home of Hezekiah Dunham. In 1893, the church moved into its first dedicated building located on the Bedford Commons. The old First Baptist Church is a stone building done in the Late Gothic Revival style and was designed by architect Jacob Snyder. In 1968, the First Baptist Church moved to its present location at the corner of Turney Road and West Glendale Avenue. The old stone church still stands though and is owned by the Bedford Historical Society. It currently serves as a community building and a rental hall.

Bedford became an incorporated village on March 15, 1837. In 1837, the population of Bedford Township had grown to be 475 people and at that time, the residents petitioned to become the Village of Bedford, which sits at the geographic center of Bedford Township. At this time, Hezekiah Dunham, who was a prominent and wealthy local business man, and his wife, Clarissa Dunham, donated three acres of land for the village to be able to build a public square as well as other public and religious buildings. The deed for the land stated the property was to be &quot;used as a public square forever.&quot;

In addition to the falls on Tinkers Creek and the abundant forests, transportation helped Bedford to grow. Before the roads were even built, Bedford was situated along the main route between Pittsburgh and Cleveland and was an important stagecoach stop. Today this is State Route 14, which runs through town from the northwest to southeast.

Transportation became even more important in the area when the Ohio and Erie Canal opened in 1827 and the Cleveland &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad began in 1852. Both of these helped drive more industry to the area, and by 1840 the population of Bedford was 2,021. Another railroad, the Connotton Valley Railroad, opened in 1881.

In 1927, the Bedford Municipal Hospital was built. The original hospital still stands, though it has been heavily added onto since it was first constructed. It is now operated as a branch of University Hospitals of Cleveland.

The village of Maple Heights left Bedford Township in 1915 and in 1932 Maple Heights achieved city status.

In 1932, the Village of Bedford adopted a city manager government and charger and became the City of Bedford. As the village grew, many industries developed in Bedford and new businesses opened. Some of the important businesses in Bedford were manufacturing companies:

* The Marble &amp; Shattuck Chair Company operated in Bedford from 1885 to 1894, when it moved to Cleveland. 
* The B.L. Marble Chair Co. made wooden chairs from 1894. 
* Founded in 1903, the Franklin Oil and Gas Company made engine oil and similar products. 
* The Best Foundry Co., founded in 1905 manufactured metal castings, especially stoves.
* The McMyler-Interstate Company, established in 1910, was the largest manufacturer in Bedford. It made the largest crane in the world in 1919.
* Founded in 1922, the Walker China Company made marbles before manufacturing china. 
* The Harper Aircraft Manufacturing Company built monoplanes beginning in 1930. 
* In 1938, the Lewis Welding and Engineering Corporation opened and was an important supplier for the military during World War II.

The first car dealerships opened on Broadway Avenue in the early 1950s and formed the Bedford Automile Dealers Association in 1956, formally creating the first Bedford Automile. The Bedford Automile Dealers Association was created to not only give the car dealerships in the area a unified voice for working with the city but to also create a group who would actively help to improve the city.

On February 20, 1951, the northeast corner of Bedford Township broke off from the City of Bedford and incorporated to become the village of Bedford Heights, Ohio. Bedford Heights achieved city status in 1961.

On February 20, 2023, an explosion occurred at a I. Schumann &amp; Co. copper alloy plant in Bedford, causing a large fire and catastrophic damage to the facility and numerous cars in a lot across the street. According to authorities, 14 people were hospitalized for burn injuries, including a 46 year old factory worker, who later succumbed to them after being admitted in critical condition.

<doc id="129074" wikidata="Q818897" url="?curid=129074" title="Berea, Ohio">
<text>Berea ( ) is a city in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. The population was 18,545 at the 2020 census. A western suburb of Cleveland, it is a part of the Cleveland metropolitan area. Berea is home to Baldwin Wallace University, as well as the training facility for the Cleveland Browns and the Cuyahoga County Fairgrounds.

==History==

Berea was established in 1836. The first European settlers were originally from Connecticut. Berea fell within Connecticut&#x27;s Western Reserve and was surveyed and divided into townships and ranges by Gideon Granger, who served as Postmaster General under President Thomas Jefferson. Abram Hickox, a Revolutionary War veteran, bought the first plot in what is today Middleburg Heights and in 1808 traveled west from Connecticut to his new purchase. Dissuaded by the swampy and heavily forested land he decided to settle in Cleveland. He became successful as Cleveland&#x27;s first full-time blacksmith. His plot of land was sold to his nephew, Jared Hickox, who came to the area with his wife Sarah and family in 1809. They followed an ancient Indian highway down through the forest from Cleveland and then, at what is now the corner of Bagley and Pearl roads, began to hack their way directly west. About in, they found Granger&#x27;s plot markers and set up their homestead. Today, this area is a strip mall on Bagley Road, just down the road from Berea. At the time Hickox discovered Granger&#x27;s plot markers, the area was a swampy lowland and, as fate would have it, the Hickox&#x27;s two grown up sons died from typhoid fever shortly after the family&#x27;s arrival. The family farm was in dire straits, having been so severely depleted of male laborers. Love came to the rescue, however; and the area&#x27;s spirits were lifted by its first marriage, that of Jared&#x27;s daughter Amy Hickox to a recent arrival, Abijah Bagley. Bagley ended up taking over the farm and managing it into a successful concern. Today, Berea&#x27;s largest street bears his name.

In 1827, educator John Baldwin moved to Middeburg Township where he joined forces with James Gilruth and Henry Olcott Sheldon, Methodist circuit preachers who wanted to form an ideal Christian community. In 1836, they pledged to pool all their properties to create a Utopian &quot;Community of United Christians.&quot; Members of the Community vowed to avoid all luxuries and temptations that would prevent them from achieving the Methodist ideal of &quot;sanctification,&quot; or perfect love of God. In 1836, Baldwin and the others of the Utopian Community tried to think of a name for their new town. Nehemiah Brown proposed Tabor (perhaps from the biblical Mount Tabor), but Henry Sheldon suggested Berea, citing the biblical Berea in the Acts 17:10-11. They decided to let God decide the Community&#x27;s place name by flipping a coin, and the coin came up Berea. Financial disputes led to the dissolution of the Community and the departure of James Gilruth within a year. John Baldwin and Henry Sheldon then teamed up with Josiah Holbrook, the founder of the American Lyceum movement for adult and community education, to found the Berea Seminary, a central instructional facility for Lyceum teachers, and a Lyceum Village composed of community members dedicated to creation of an educated population. The Lyceum Village concept never caught on in Berea due to the 1838 Public School Act, but the idea of an ideal community centered around a school continued even after the Berea Seminary closed.

The failure of these two Utopian experiments left John Baldwin and Henry Sheldon in deep debt. However, Baldwin had since 1838 been making grindstones from sandstone in the creek bed of the Rocky River. In the 1840s, Henry Sheldon began selling them via the Erie Canal in New York State. This was the beginning of the Berea quarrying industry. After the Big Four Railroad was built from Cleveland to Cincinnati, Baldwin built a railroad to connect his quarries to the Big Four Depot.

In 1845, Baldwin convinced the North Ohio Conference of the Methodist Church to charter a new school: a new Utopian venture of sorts, because the new school, the Baldwin Institute, would provide education to all, regardless of sex, race, religious creed, or ability to pay. In 1855, it was renamed Baldwin University. By the 1880s, the quarries had begun to intrude on the site of the university. In 1891, the school broke ground for a new campus at Front Street and Bagley Road. New buildings were constructed and old buildings were moved. In 1866, James Wallace purchased the site of the Lyceum Village from the German Children&#x27;s Home to become the German Wallace College Campus. In 1913, Baldwin University and German-Wallace College merged to become Baldwin–Wallace College, now Baldwin Wallace University. Berea High School was the town&#x27;s first high school, founded in 1882 and closed in 2020. The current Berea–Midpark High School opened in 2020.

===Berea sandstone===

The geological stratum on which the city rests is the sedimentary formation Berea sandstone, a geological formation named after the city which extends across Ohio, western Pennsylvania, and northern Kentucky. This comprises a sandstone laid down during the early Mississippian. In the 19th and early 20th century, this formation was extensively quarried, with the quarries eventually displacing the original main street of the town, as well as the original location of Baldwin University, which sold its five-acre campus to the quarries for $100,000 in 1888, moving to a new location to the north.

After beginning of quarrying of the Berea sandstone in the 1830s, Baldwin initially shipped grindstones to Cleveland by ox carts, and later the quarries were connected to the railroad by a spur line. Berea proclaims itself &quot;The Grindstone Capital of the World&quot;. The town&#x27;s symbol is a grindstone, a tribute to the many grindstones that came out of its quarries.

The quarries also provided sandstone that was extensively used as a construction material, in the form of Berea dimension stone. Huge amounts of it came from Berea, and were used architecturally in many important buildings. The quarries closed in the late 1930s, when concrete came into wide use for construction. Several lakes in the area are former quarry pits that have been allowed to fill with water, including Baldwin, Wallace and Coe lakes.

<text>Bratenahl ( ) is a village in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States, on the southern shore of Lake Erie. One of Cleveland&#x27;s oldest streetcar suburbs, it is bordered by the city on three sides and by the Lake Erie shoreline to the north. The population was 1,430 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Incorporated in 1903, Bratenahl was named after its founder, Charles Bratenahl. It is one of the older residential suburbs of Cleveland along with Shaker Heights, Lakewood, and Cleveland Heights; of these, Bratenahl has the highest per capita wealth. Bratenahl is a small community of fewer than 1,200 population inhabiting approximately 700 households, some of which are stately estates, townhouses, and condominiums on the lakefront. Its famous Lake Shore Boulevard has been featured in many magazines including &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot;.

Bratenahl is home to a once controversial luxury high-rise condominium complex named Bratenahl Place. Though many residents opposed it at the time, in 1967 two large multi-occupancy buildings of brutalist architectural design were built on the lakefront. One of the two structures was originally intended to be a 180-unit rental apartment building, while the other, smaller one was a condominium from its inception. In 1976 however, the larger one also became a condominium.

Bratenahl was the subject of a joint Marshall Project and WEWS investigation that found that the majority of drivers cited for traffic violations by the Bratenahl police were Black. The report found that Bratenahl village had assessed more than $700,000 in fines, court costs, and other revenue since 2020, mostly from Black drivers passing through the village&#x27;s jurisdiction.

<text>Cleveland Heights is a city in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. The population was 45,312 at the 2020 census. One of Cleveland&#x27;s historic streetcar suburbs, it was founded as a village in 1903 and a city in 1921.

==History==

The area that is now the city of Cleveland Heights lies atop the Portage Escarpment. Until the late 1800s, the area remained largely timber and farmland, with a few orchards, quarries, and vineyards. The first road through the city, Mayfield Road, was not built until 1828. Some of the land was divided into farms, but it also had quarries in the 19th century. One of the early quarries was established by Duncan McFarland who mined bluestone. This led to the settlement that grew up around the quarry for the workers to live in to be referred to as Bluestone. There is still a road of this name in that area.

In 1873, business magnate John D. Rockefeller acquired about in what is now the cities of East Cleveland and Cleveland Heights, with a water cure hotel, which he converted to a mansion for his family in East Cleveland. Eventually, some of the land, straddling both suburbs, was turned into residential developments, and, in 1938, the family donated land which is now Forest Hill Park.

The development of electric streetcars made the development of suburbs far outside Cleveland&#x27;s city limits practical for the first time in the 1890s. About 1890, a town center began forming at what is now the intersection of Mayfield and Superior roads. The population of the area encompassed by Cleveland Heights voted in August 1900 to incorporate under state law as a hamlet. The population of about 1,500 grew quickly, and in 1903 incorporated as a village. It had a population of 15,396 in 1920 and was incorporated as a city on August 9, 1921. Between 1920 and 1930, Cleveland Heights&#x27; population more than tripled. By 1960 it had a population of 61,813.
In 1890, railroad baron Patrick Calhoun purchased atop nearby Cedar Hill, and in 1893 established the planned community of Euclid Heights. In 1913, Barton R. Deming convinced Rockefeller to enter into a purchase agreement for the formerly leased to the Euclid Golf Club of Euclid Heights, which resulting in the founding of the B.R. Deming Company to develop the Euclid Golf Allotment. The Euclid Golf Allotment was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

In November 1926, the establishment of a new business district on Taylor Road was announced. This resulted in numerous residential homes and mixed-use structures built in the Tudor Revival style that are now known as the Stadium Square Historic District. 

In the 1950s, Cleveland Heights saw the influx of many merchant class and professional Jewish people leaving Cleveland, particularly the Hough and Glenville neighborhoods. In 1961, 35% of the Jewish population of Cuyahoga County lived in Cleveland Heights. Although the Black population of Cleveland Heights was less than 1% in 1960, partially due to restrictive covenants, Black Clevelanders began to move into Cleveland Heights in the 1960s and 1970s. This led to violence and pushback from some white citizens. However, organizations such as Heights Citizens For Human Rights and Heights Community Congress formed to protest violence against Black citizens, and promote integration in the city.

==Geography==
Cleveland Heights is located at (41.509652, -81.563301).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Cleveland Heights is made up of three watersheds, the Doan Brook Watershed, the Dugway Brook Watershed, and the Nine Mile Creek Watershed. Approximately 50% of Cleveland Heights is part of the Dugway Brook Watershed.

==Economy==

Coventry Village is a commercial business district in Cleveland Heights situated on Coventry Road. Coventry is associated with Northeast Ohio&#x27;s artistic, musical, bohemian, hippie and emerging hipster communities.

==Government==
Cleveland Heights is governed by a city charter adopted in 1921 and amended in 1972, 1982, 1986 and 2019. Until 2019, the Cleveland Heights city charter specified a council–manager form of government, with seven members of council elected to four-year terms. On November 5, 2019, Cleveland Heights voters approved an amendment to the city&#x27;s charter to become a strong Mayor-Council form of government with the Mayor serving as the city&#x27;s chief executive. Under the amended Charter, in November 2021, Cleveland Heights voters cast ballots for Mayor for the first time. Kahlil Seren was elected to be Cleveland Heights&#x27; first directly elected mayor, and was sworn in on January 1, 2022.

The current city council is composed of Vice President Craig Cobb, President Melody Joy Hart, Davida Russell, Tony Cuda, Janine Boyd, Anthony Mattox, Jr., and Gail Larson.

Cleveland Heights is reliably Democratic. Six of the seven current members of council are Democrats. In the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama defeated John McCain 84.2%-15.0% while winning the state, while in the 2004 presidential election, John Kerry defeated George W. Bush 80.8%-18.8% in the city but was unable to win the state. In 2012, every precinct in the city was carried by Barack Obama. Even in 2016 and 2020, as Ohio as a whole became more Republican, Cleveland Heights voted strongly Democratic; Hillary Clinton defeated Donald Trump 83.9%-11.4% and Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump 85.1%-13.1%.

Cleveland Heights is in Ohio&#x27;s 11th congressional district, which is represented by Congresswoman Shontel Brown. Ohio&#x27;s 11th congressional district was formerly represented by U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia Fudge.

In 2003, Cleveland Heights voters approved a referendum to establish Ohio&#x27;s first domestic partnership registry.

<text>East Cleveland is a city in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. The population was 13,792 at the 2020 census. It is a suburb lying east and south of Cleveland and west of Cleveland Heights.

==History==

Historically East Cleveland was partially founded by Scottish immigrants, whose names can still be found in the city such as Shaw, McIlrath, and Eddy. East Cleveland incorporated as a village in 1895 and became a city in 1911. This charter included provisions for women&#x27;s suffrage, which at the time was unheard of east of the Mississippi River. Before the charter passed, the city of Cleveland unsuccessfully attempted to annex the emerging municipality in 1910 and again in 1916.

East Cleveland is home to General Electric&#x27;s historic Nela Park, the world&#x27;s first industrial park. Nela Park, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, continues to operate today as the functional headquarters for GE Lighting and is the city&#x27;s second largest employer. Huron Hospital, a satellite hospital of the Cleveland Clinic, was the city&#x27;s largest employer. Huron Hospital was a notable health care facility, being the only Level-II trauma center between Cleveland&#x27;s MetroHealth Medical Center, located on West 25th Street, and Hillcrest Hospital, located in Mayfield Heights. Huron Hospital closed in early spring of 2011.

By the Great Depression a great number of homes along &quot;Millionaires&#x27; Row&quot; were demolished or abandoned. Although commercial properties and fast-food chains replaced many Euclid Avenue homes during the second half of the 20th century, East Cleveland is still home to 18 of the original &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Row&quot; homes, while only six are left in the city of Cleveland.

After World War II, development of other suburbs within the region brought a number of changes to East Cleveland. By the 1960s, African Americans constituted an increasingly large portion of the city&#x27;s population. By 1984, East Cleveland was one of the largest primarily black communities in Ohio, with a population of 36,957.

Rockefeller Park and the Historic Lake View Cemetery.

A complete road repair of both Euclid Ave and Superior Ave has also led to interest and land purchases in the vicinity. 
== Government ==

East Cleveland is a charter city that is granted its authority under the home rule provisions of the Ohio constitution.

Prior to 1985, East Cleveland had been under the leadership of a Commission and City Manager. In 1985 voters grew frustrated with that form of government after two commissioners were charged with theft in office, and after a revolving door of city managers resulted in little stability and a reduction in services. Citizens for Sound Government, a group of residents, led a petition drive to elect a strong mayor and to create a five-member city council. Attorney Darryl E. Pittman became the first mayor to lead the city since 1908. He was sworn in on January 1, 1986.

After two years on the job, in Pittman&#x27;s second two-year term, Ohio&#x27;s State Auditor declared on September 9, 1988 that East Cleveland was in fiscal emergency. The fiscal emergency designation came when the water and sewer fund were found to have deficits in excess of $2 million. Pittman was defeated in 1989 by Wallace D. Davis, the council president and a funeral home owner. Prior to his defeat, Pittman convinced former U.S. Rep. Louis Stokes to support a congressional amendment that made East Cleveland a &quot;direct entitlement city&quot; under HUD. That designation gave the city the authority to receive more than $1 million a year in block grant funding directly from HUD.

Davis borrowed $2.5 million that had to be paid back in eight years to get the city out of fiscal emergency. His administration made the last payment in 1997, but the city remained in fiscal emergency throughout Mayor Emmanuel Onunwor&#x27;s eight-year term in office, and after he was indicted and convicted on federal charges of racketeering and corruption in 2004. Onunwor was sentenced to nine years in federal prison in September 2004. He was replaced by Council President Saratha Goggins who finished the remainder of his term.

Eric J. Brewer became the city&#x27;s fourth elected mayor on January 1, 2006 and served one term. Brewer had been an investigative journalist. He negotiated an agreement with Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson to take over East Cleveland&#x27;s water department in 2008, resulting in significant savings to help the city as it struggled through fiscal emergency. The deal resulted in the transfer of city employees to Cleveland as part of the 25-year agreement.

During his primary re-election campaign in 2009, Brewer accused the police union of releasing photographs depicting him wearing women&#x27;s lingerie.

Gary Norton, a Democrat first elected to the city council in 2006, was elected mayor after defeating Brewer by a nearly 2-1 margin in the Democratic primary election. He took office in January 2010. He did not face a challenger in the general election.

After two unsuccessful recall attempts, Gary Norton and city council president Thomas Wheeler were defeated in a special recall election on December 6, 2016. Norton lost 548 to 528 and Wheeler lost 229 to 211. The city council&#x27;s vice president, Brandon King, assumed Norton&#x27;s position as mayor. King won the September 2016 Democratic primary for mayor, and was elected on in November 2017 to serve out the remainder of Norton&#x27;s term.

===Crime===
The violent crime rate of 7.69 per 100,000 residents is about twice the national rate of 3.8 and above the statewide rate of 2.85. In the same way, the number of reported crimes per square mile (168) is about five times that of Ohio (35) and the nation (32.8).

===Arrest of Arnold Black===
On April 28, 2012, Detective Randy Hicks, Officer Jonathan O&#x27;Leary, and other members of the East Cleveland Police Department arrested Arnold Black on suspicion of drug activity. Hicks punched Black as O&#x27;Leary stood by. Black was then placed in a holding cell after his arrest and was later released. Black claimed that the police beat him while he was handcuffed and locked him in a storage closet for four days with no toilet and nothing to eat or drink but a carton of milk. In the resulting lawsuit, the police were unable to produce dashboard camera video of the beating or any police reports of the arrest. A jury initially awarded Black $22 million, including $10 million from Police Chief Ralph Spotts. The city appealed the verdict and the Eighth District Court of Appeals overturned the decision. The Ohio Supreme Court also refused to hear Black&#x27;s appeal. However at a subsequent re-trial in 2019 Black was awarded US$20 million in compensatory damages and US$30 million in punitive damages.

== Parks and recreation ==
The Forest Hill Park boasts three baseball diamonds, tennis courts and walking trails that have retained the natural green space as intended by John D. Rockefeller Jr. when he deeded the park to East Cleveland and the City of Cleveland Heights. Forest Hill Park is the largest single body of green park space between two large metroparks on the far east and west sides of Cleveland, Ohio. The city also features Pattison Park and Hawley Park.

==Infrastructure==

East Cleveland is a major public transportation hub for northeast Ohio with a total of 80 (approximately one-third) of the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority bus routes beginning or ending inside the city.

The GCRTA&#x27;s Red Line&#x27;s eastern terminus is located at the Windermere Rapid Station, located on Euclid Avenue in East Cleveland. Destinations along the Red Line include University Circle, Cleveland State University, Tower City Center/Public Square, the West Side Market, and Hopkins International Airport. Passengers boarding GCRTA buses with stops in East Cleveland have access to an even wider range of employment, educational, recreational and cultural destinations throughout the Cleveland area.

=== Medical care ===
East Cleveland is home to several medical care facilities including the Candlewood Park Healthcare Center and the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Health Center. Candlewood Park Healthcare Center offers care for senior citizens including outpatient care, behavioral healthcare and rehabilitation services. The Stephanie Tubbs Jones Health Center, which is also a Cleveland Clinic facility, specializes in many different areas including cardiology, chronic disease services, diabetes, internal medicine, and general surgeries.

==Education==

The East Cleveland demographics on the levels of education are as follows: with 34% of residents having a high school diploma or equivalent, 37% have at least some college, and 7% have a completed bachelor&#x27;s degree.

=== East Cleveland City Schools ===
The East Cleveland City School District provides public education to more than 3000 students in seven new or renovated buildings that were updated as part of a $94 million state-sponsored school construction project. Voters in 1997 agreed to add another $10 million to the $94 million for operating costs.

According to the Ohio Department of Education reports from January 2016, nearly 30% of high school students attending East Cleveland City Schools fail to graduate on time. Students are falling behind state expectations in English, Language Arts, and Mathematics. The district also lags behind the state in the performance index score. During the 2014–2015 school year, East Cleveland City Schools’ performance index score was 66.8. This was the lowest it had been in four years.

East Cleveland schools consist of Shaw High School, Heritage Middle School (formerly Kirk Middle School), Prospect Elementary School (closed in 2016) open for administrative use, Chambers Elementary School, Superior Elementary School, Mayfair Elementary School and Caledonia Elementary School. Rozelle Elementary School was closed due to lower student enrollment and was later demolished.

East Cleveland Public Library operates the Main Branch at 14101 Euclid Avenue. In December 2009 the Caledonia Branch at 960 Caledonia Avenue, and the North Branch at 1425 Hayden Avenue were closed due to budget cuts and the decline in population. East Cleveland Public Library became a member of CLEVNET in 1985.

<text>Fairview Park is a city in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. The population was 17,291 at the 2020 census. A suburb of Cleveland, it is a part of the Cleveland metropolitan area.

== History ==

Fairview Park was originally part of Rockport Township, later the Rocky River hamlet. The hamlet was incorporated as a village in 1903 and was split in 1910, with the northern part of the region becoming Rocky River and the southern part assuming the name Goldwood. Part of the Goldwood Township was later annexed to Rocky River and Goldwood would subsequently be incorporated as a separate village. Afterwards, Goldwood was split into two regions. A large portion of the land to the north became the Village of Fairview (later Fairview Village). Meanwhile, the remaining land located in the southwest corner and land along Center Ridge Road remained as Goldwood and was later incorporated as a village. By 1925, the remaining Goldwood region was renamed Parkview.

Both Fairview Village and Parkview remained small suburbs of its neighboring Cleveland (which had annexed most of what was West Park in 1923). In 1929, an economic recession in Fairview led to consideration of annexation to Cleveland. However, the plan never went to the ballot and Fairview maintained its independence. In 1948, Fairview became Fairview Park. Much of the growth of this region did not take place until after World War II. Most notably, the village began attracting former Cleveland residents when Fairview Shopping Center opened in 1947 on Lorain Road. In 1950, the village&#x27;s size exceeded 5,000 at 9,234 and became the City of Fairview Park. The first city charter was adopted in November 1958. The remaining Parkview region was later annexed to Fairview in 1967.

<doc id="129090" wikidata="Q174857" url="?curid=129090" title="Scoliosis">
<text>Scoliosis (: scolioses) is a condition in which a person&#x27;s spine has an irregular curve in the coronal plane. The curve is usually S- or C-shaped over three dimensions. In some, the degree of curve is stable, while in others, it increases over time. Mild scoliosis does not typically cause problems, but more severe cases can affect breathing and movement. Pain is usually present in adults, and can worsen with age. As the condition progresses, it may alter a person&#x27;s life, and hence can also be considered a disability. It can be compared to kyphosis and lordosis, other abnormal curvatures of the spine which are in the sagittal plane (front-back) rather than the coronal (left-right).
The cause of most cases is unknown, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Scoliosis most often occurs during growth spurts right before puberty. Risk factors include other affected family members. It can also occur due to another condition such as muscle spasms, cerebral palsy, Marfan syndrome, and tumors such as neurofibromatosis. Diagnosis is confirmed with X-rays. Scoliosis is typically classified as either structural in which the curve is fixed, or functional in which the underlying spine is normal. Left-right asymmetries, of the vertebrae and their musculature, especially in the thoracic region, may cause mechanical instability of the spinal column.
Treatment depends on the degree of curve, location, and cause. The age of the patient is also important, since some treatments are ineffective in adults, who are no longer growing. Minor curves may simply be watched periodically. Treatments may include bracing, specific exercises, posture checking, and surgery. The brace must be fitted to the person and used daily until growing stops. Specific exercises, such as exercises that focus on the core, may be used to try to decrease the risk of worsening. They may be done alone or along with other treatments such as bracing. Evidence that chiropractic manipulation, dietary supplements, or exercises can prevent the condition from worsening is weak. However, exercise is still recommended due to its other health benefits.
Scoliosis occurs in about 3% of people. It most commonly develops between the ages of ten and twenty. Females typically are more severely affected than males with a ratio of 4:1. The term is .
==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms associated with scoliosis can include:
* Pain in the back at the site of the curve, which may radiate to the legs
* Respiratory or cardiac problems in severe cases
* Constipation due to curvature causing &quot;tightening&quot; of the stomach, intestines, etc.

The signs of scoliosis can include:
* Uneven musculature on one side of the spine
* Rib prominence or a prominent shoulder blade, caused by rotation of the rib cage in thoracic scoliosis
* Uneven posture
* Heart and lung problems in severe cases
* Calcium deposits in the cartilage endplate and sometimes in the disc itself

===Course===
People who have reached skeletal maturity are less likely to have a worsening case. Some severe cases of scoliosis can lead to diminishing lung capacity, pressure exerted on the heart, and restricted physical activities.

Longitudinal studies have revealed that the most common form of the condition, late-onset idiopathic scoliosis, causes little physical impairment other than back pain and cosmetic concerns, even when untreated, with mortality rates similar to the general population. Older beliefs that untreated idiopathic scoliosis necessarily progressed into severe (cardiopulmonary) disability by old age have been refuted.

==Causes==

An estimated 65% of scoliosis cases are idiopathic (cause unknown), about 15% are congenital, and about 10% are secondary to a neuromuscular disease.

About 38% of variance in scoliosis risk is due to genetic factors, and 62% is due to the environment. The genetics are likely complex, however, given the inconsistent inheritance and discordance among monozygotic twins. The specific genes that contribute to development of scoliosis have not been conclusively identified. Several candidate gene studies have found associations between idiopathic scoliosis and genes mediating bone formation, bone metabolism, and connective tissue structure. Several genome-wide studies have identified a number of loci as significantly linked to idiopathic scoliosis. In 2006, idiopathic scoliosis was linked with three microsatellite polymorphisms in the &quot;MATN1&quot; gene (encoding for matrilin 1, cartilage matrix protein). Fifty-three single nucleotide polymorphism markers in the DNA that are significantly associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis were identified through a genome-wide association study.

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis has no clear causal agent, and is generally believed to be multifactorial; leading to &quot;progressive functional limitations&quot; for individuals. Research suggests that Posterior Spinal Fusion (PSF) can be used to correct the more severe deformities caused by adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Such procedures can result in a return to physical activity in about 6 months, which is very promising, although minimal back pain is still to be expected in the most severe cases. The prevalence of scoliosis is 1–2% among adolescents, but the likelihood of progression among adolescents with a Cobb angle less than 20° is about 10–20%.

Congenital scoliosis can be attributed to a malformation of the spine during weeks three to six &quot;in utero&quot; due to a failure of formation, a failure of segmentation, or a combination of stimuli. Incomplete and abnormal segmentation results in an abnormally shaped vertebra, at times fused to a normal vertebra or unilaterally fused vertebrae, leading to the abnormal lateral curvature of the spine.
Vertebrae of the spine, especially in the thoracic region, are, on average, asymmetric. The mid-axis of these vertebral bodies tends to point systematically to the right of the median body plane. A strong asymmetry of the vertebrae and their musculature, may lead to mechanical instability of the column, especially during phases of rapid growth. The asymmetry is thought to be caused by an embryological twist of the body.

===Resulting from other conditions===
Secondary scoliosis due to neuropathic and myopathic conditions can lead to a loss of muscular support for the spinal column so that the spinal column is pulled in abnormal directions. Some conditions which may cause secondary scoliosis include muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, poliomyelitis, cerebral palsy, spinal cord trauma, and myotonia. Scoliosis often presents itself, or worsens, during an adolescent&#x27;s growth spurt and is more often diagnosed in females than males.

Scoliosis associated with known syndromes is often subclassified as &quot;syndromic scoliosis&quot;. Scoliosis can be associated with amniotic band syndrome, Arnold–Chiari malformation, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, cerebral palsy, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, connective tissue disorders, muscular dystrophy, familial dysautonomia, CHARGE syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hyperflexibility, &quot;floppy baby&quot; syndrome, and other variants of the condition), fragile X syndrome, Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia, hemihypertrophy, Loeys–Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, nail–patella syndrome, neurofibromatosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, Prader–Willi syndrome, proteus syndrome, spina bifida, spinal muscular atrophy, syringomyelia, and pectus carinatum.

Another form of secondary scoliosis is degenerative scoliosis, also known as de novo scoliosis, which develops later in life secondary to degenerative (may or may not be associated with aging) changes. This is a type of deformity that starts and progresses because of the collapse of the vertebral column in an asymmetrical manner. As bones start to become weaker and the ligaments and discs located in the spine become worn as a result of age-related changes, the spine begins to curve.

==Diagnosis==
People who initially present with scoliosis undergo a physical examination to determine whether the deformity has an underlying cause and to exclude the possibility of the underlying condition more serious than simple scoliosis.

The person&#x27;s gait is assessed, with an exam for signs of other abnormalities (e.g., spina bifida as evidenced by a dimple, hairy patch, lipoma, or hemangioma). A thorough neurological examination is also performed, the skin for &quot;café au lait&quot; spots, indicative of neurofibromatosis, the feet for cavovarus deformity, abdominal reflexes and muscle tone for spasticity.

When a person can cooperate, he or she is asked to bend forward as far as possible. This is known as the Adams forward bend test and is often performed on school students. If a prominence is noted, then scoliosis is a possibility and an X-ray may be done to confirm the diagnosis.

As an alternative, a scoliometer may be used to diagnose the condition.

When scoliosis is suspected, weight-bearing, full-spine AP/coronal (front-back view) and lateral/sagittal (side view) X-rays are usually taken to assess the scoliosis curves and the kyphosis and lordosis, as these can also be affected in individuals with scoliosis. Full-length standing spine X-rays are the standard method for evaluating the severity and progression of scoliosis, and whether it is congenital or idiopathic in nature. In growing individuals, serial radiographs are obtained at 3- to 12-month intervals to follow curve progression, and, in some instances, MRI investigation is warranted to look at the spinal cord. An average scoliosis patient has been in contact with around 50–300 mGy of radiation due to these radiographs during this time period.

The standard method for assessing the curvature quantitatively is measuring the Cobb angle, which is the angle between two lines, drawn perpendicular to the upper endplate of the uppermost vertebra involved and the lower endplate of the lowest vertebra involved. For people with two curves, Cobb angles are followed for both curves. In some people, lateral-bending X-rays are obtained to assess the flexibility of the curves or the primary and compensatory curves.

Congenital and idiopathic scoliosis that develops before the age of 10 is referred to as early-onset scoliosis. Progressive idiopathic early-onset scoliosis can be a life-threatening condition with negative effects on pulmonary function. Scoliosis that develops after 10 is referred to as adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Screening adolescents without symptoms for scoliosis is of unclear benefit.

===Definition===
Scoliosis is defined as a three-dimensional deviation in the axis of a person&#x27;s spine. Most instances, including the Scoliosis Research Society, define scoliosis as a Cobb angle of more than 10° to the right or left as the examiner faces the person, i.e. in the coronal plane.

Scoliosis has been described as a biomechanical deformity, the progression of which depends on asymmetric forces otherwise known as the Hueter–Volkmann Law.

==Management==

Scoliosis curves do not straighten out on their own. Many children have slight curves that do not need treatment. In these cases, the children grow up to lead normal body posture by itself, even though their small curves never go away. If the patient is still growing and has a larger curve, it is important to monitor the curve for change by periodic examination and standing x-rays as needed. The rise in spinal abnormalities require examination by a neurosurgeon to determine if active treatment is needed.

The traditional medical management of scoliosis is complex and is determined by the severity of the curvature and skeletal maturity, which together help predict the likelihood of progression.
The conventional options for children and adolescents are:

# Observation
# Bracing
# Surgery
# Physical therapy. Evidence suggests use of scoliosis specific exercises might prevent the progression of the curve along with possible bracing and surgery avoidance.

For adults, treatment usually focuses on relieving any pain:

# Pain medication
# Posture checking
# Bracing
# Surgery

Treatment for idiopathic scoliosis also depends upon the severity of the curvature, the spine&#x27;s potential for further growth, and the risk that the curvature will progress. Mild scoliosis (less than 30° deviation) and moderate scoliosis (30–45°) can typically be treated conservatively with bracing in conjunction with scoliosis-specific exercises. Severe curvatures that rapidly progress may require surgery with spinal rod placement and spinal fusion. In all cases, early intervention offers the best results.

A specific type of physical therapy may be useful. Evidence to support its use, however, is weak. Low quality evidence suggests scoliosis-specific exercises (SSE) may be more effective than electrostimulation. Evidence for the Schroth method is insufficient to support its use. Significant improvement in function, vertebral angles and trunk asymmetries have been recorded following the implementation of Schroth method in terms of conservative management of scoliosis. Some other forms of exercises interventions have been lately used in the clinical practice for therapeutic management of scoliosis such as global postural reeducation and the Klapp method.

===Bracing===

Bracing is normally done when the person has bone growth remaining and is, in general, implemented to hold the curve and prevent it from progressing to the point where surgery is recommended. In some cases with juveniles, bracing has reduced curves significantly, going from a 40° (of the curve, mentioned in length above) out of the brace to 18°. Braces are sometimes prescribed for adults to relieve pain related to scoliosis. Bracing involves fitting the person with a device that covers the torso; in some cases, it extends to the neck (example being the Milwaukee Brace).

The most commonly used brace is a TLSO, such as a Boston brace, a corset-like appliance that fits from armpits to hips and is custom-made from fiberglass or plastic. It is typically recommended to be worn 22–23 hours a day, and applies pressure on the curves in the spine. The effectiveness of the brace depends on not only brace design and orthotist skill, but also people&#x27;s compliance and amount of wear per day. An alternative form of brace is a nighttime only brace, that is worn only at night whilst the child sleeps, and which overcorrects the deformity. Whilst nighttime braces are more convenient for children and families, it is unknown if the effectiveness of the brace is as good as conventional braces. The UK government have funded a large clinical trial (called the BASIS study) to resolve this uncertainty. The BASIS study is ongoing throughout the UK in all of the leading UK children&#x27;s hospitals that treat scoliosis, with families encouraged to take part.

Indications for bracing: people who are still growing who present with Cobb angles less than 20° should be closely monitored. People who are still growing who present with Cobb angles of 20 to 29° should be braced according to the risk of progression by considering age, Cobb angle increase over a six-month period, Risser sign, and clinical presentation. People who are still growing who present with Cobb angles greater than 30° should be braced. However, these are guidelines and not every person will fit into this table.

For example, a person who is still growing with a 17° Cobb angle and significant thoracic rotation or flatback could be considered for nighttime bracing. On the opposite end of the growth spectrum, a 29° Cobb angle and a Risser sign three or four might not need to be braced because the potential for progression is reduced. The Scoliosis Research Society&#x27;s recommendations for bracing include curves progressing to larger than 25°, curves presenting between 30 and 45°, Risser sign 0, 1, or 2 (an X-ray measurement of a pelvic growth area), and less than six months from the onset of menses in girls.

Evidence supports that bracing prevents worsening of disease, but whether it changes quality of life, appearance, or back pain is unclear.

===Surgery===

Surgery is usually recommended by orthopedists for curves with a high likelihood of progression (i.e., greater than 45–50° of magnitude), curves that would be cosmetically unacceptable as an adult, curves in people with spina bifida and cerebral palsy that interfere with sitting and care, and curves that affect physiological functions such as breathing.

Surgery is indicated by the Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) at 45–50° and by the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) at a Cobb angle of 45°. SOSORT uses the 45–50° threshold as a result of the well-documented, plus or minus 5° measurement error that can occur while measuring Cobb angles.

Surgeons who are specialized in spine surgery perform surgery for scoliosis. To completely straighten a scoliotic spine is usually impossible, but for the most part, significant corrections are achieved.

The two main types of surgery are:
* Anterior fusion: This surgical approach is through an incision at the side of the chest wall.
* Posterior fusion: This surgical approach is through an incision on the back and involves the use of metal instrumentation to correct the curve.

One or both of these surgical procedures may be needed. The surgery may be done in one or two stages and, on average, takes four to eight hours.

A new tethering procedure (anterior vertebral body tethering) may be appropriate for some patients.

Spine surgery can be painful and may also be associated with post-surgical pain. Different approaches for pain management are used in surgery including epidural administration and systemic analgesia (also known as general analgesia). Epidural analgesia medication are often used surgically including combinations of local anesthetics and pain medications injected via an epidural injection. Evidence comparing different approaches for analgesia, side effects or benefits, and which approach results in greater pain relief and for how long after this type of surgery is of low to moderate quality.

== Prognosis ==
A 50-year follow-up study published in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; (2003) asserted the lifelong physical health, including cardiopulmonary and neurological functions, and mental health of people with idiopathic scoliosis are comparable to those of the general population. Scoliosis that interferes with normal systemic functions is &quot;exceptional&quot; and &quot;rare&quot;, and &quot;untreated [scoliosis] people had similar death rates and were just as functional and likely to lead productive lives 50 years after diagnosis as people with normal spines.&quot; In an earlier University of Iowa follow-up study, 91% of people with idiopathic scoliosis displayed normal pulmonary function, and their life expectancy was found to be 2% more than that of the general population. Later (2006–) studies corroborate these findings, adding that they are &quot;reassuring for the adult patient who has adolescent onset idiopathic scoliosis in approximately the 50–70° range.&quot; These modern landmark studies supersede earlier studies (e.g. Mankin-Graham-Schauk 1964) that did implicate moderate idiopathic scoliosis in impaired pulmonary function.

Generally, the prognosis of scoliosis depends on the likelihood of progression. The general rules of progression are larger curves carry a higher risk of progression than smaller curves, and thoracic and double primary curves carry a higher risk of progression than single lumbar or thoracolumbar curves. In addition, people not having yet reached skeletal maturity have a higher likelihood of progression (i.e., if the person has not yet completed the adolescent growth spurt).

==Epidemiology==
Scoliosis affects 2–3% of the United States population, or about five to nine million cases. A scoliosis (spinal column curve) of 10° or less affects 1.5–3% of individuals. The age of onset is usually between 10 years and 15 years (but can occur younger) in children and adolescents, making up to 85% of those diagnosed. This is due to rapid growth spurts during puberty when spinal development is most susceptible to genetic and environmental influences. Because female adolescents undergo growth spurts before postural musculoskeletal maturity, scoliosis is more prevalent among females.

Although fewer cases are present since using Cobb angle analysis for diagnosis, scoliosis remains significant, appearing in otherwise healthy children. Despite the fact that scoliosis is a disfigurement of the spine, it has been shown to influence the pneumonic function, balance while standing and stride execution in children. The impact of carrying backpacks on these three side effects have been broadly researched. Incidence of idiopathic scoliosis (IS) stops after puberty when skeletal maturity is attained, however further curvature may occur during late adulthood due to vertebral osteoporosis and weakened musculature.

==History==

Ever since the condition was discovered by the Greek physician Hippocrates, a cure has been sought. Treatments such as bracing and the insertion of rods into the spine were employed during the 1900s. In the mid-20th century, new treatments and improved screening methods have been developed to reduce the progression of scoliosis in patients and alleviate their associated pain. School children were during this period believed to develop poor posture as a result of working at their desks, and many were diagnosed with scoliosis. It was also considered to be caused by tuberculosis or poliomyelitis, diseases that were successfully managed using vaccines and antibiotics.

The American orthopaedic surgeon Alfred Shands Jr. discovered that two percent of patients had non-disease related scoliosis, later termed &quot;idiopathic scoliosis&quot;, or the &quot;cancer of orthopaedic surgery&quot;. These patients were treated with questionable remedies. A theory at the time—now discredited—was that the condition needed to be detected early to halt its progression, and so some schools made screening for scoliosis mandatory. Measurements of shoulder height, leg length and spinal curvature were made, and the ability to bend forwards, along with body posture, was tested, but students were sometimes misdiagnosed because of their poor posture.

An early treatment was the Milwaukee brace, a rigid contraption of metal rods attached to a plastic or leather girdle, designed to straighten the spine. Because of the constant pressure applied to the spine, the brace was uncomfortable. It caused jaw and muscle pain, skin irritation, as well as low self-esteem.

===Surgery===
In 1962, the American orthopaedic surgeon Paul Harrington introduced a metal spinal system of instrumentation that assisted with straightening the spine, as well as holding it rigid while fusion took place. The now obsolete Harrington rod operated on a ratchet system, attached by hooks to the spine at the top and bottom of the curvature that when cranked would distract—or straighten—the curve. The Harrington rod obviates the need for prolonged casting, allowing patients greater mobility in the postoperative period and significantly reducing the quality of life burden of fusion surgery. The Harrington rod was the precursor to most modern spinal instrumentation systems. A major shortcoming was that it failed to produce a posture wherein the skull would be in proper alignment with the pelvis, and it did not address rotational deformity. As the person aged, there would be increased wear and tear, early onset arthritis, disc degeneration, muscular stiffness, and acute pain. &quot;Flatback&quot; became the medical name for a related complication, especially for those who had lumbar scoliosis.

In the 1960s, the gold standard for idiopathic scoliosis was a posterior approach using a single Harrington rod. Post-operative recovery involved bed rest, casts, and braces. Poor results became apparent over time.

In the 1970s, an improved technique was developed using two rods and wires attached at each level of the spine. This segmented instrumentation system allowed patients to become mobile soon after surgery.

In the 1980s, Cotrel–Dubousset instrumentation improved fixation and addressed sagittal imbalance and rotational defects unresolved by the Harrington rod system. This technique used multiple hooks with rods to give stronger fixation in three dimensions, usually eliminating the need for postoperative bracing.

===Evolution===
There are links between human spinal morphology, bipedality, and scoliosis which suggest an evolutionary basis for the condition. Scoliosis has not been found in chimpanzees or gorillas. Thus, it has been hypothesized that scoliosis may actually be related to humans&#x27; morphological differences from these apes. Other apes have a shorter and less mobile lower spine than humans. Some of the lumbar vertebrae in &quot;Pan&quot; are &quot;captured&quot;, meaning that they are held fast between the ilium bones of the pelvis. Compared to humans, Old World monkeys have far larger erector spinae muscles, which are the muscles which hold the spine steady. These factors make the lumbar spine of most primates less flexible and far less likely to deviate than those of humans. While this may explicitly relate only to lumbar scolioses, small imbalances in the lumbar spine could precipitate thoracic problems as well.

Scoliosis may be a byproduct of strong selection for bipedalism. For a bipedal stance, a highly mobile, elongated lower spine is very beneficial. For instance, the human spine takes on an S-shaped curve with lumbar lordosis, which allows for better balance and support of an upright trunk. Selection for bipedality was likely strong enough to justify the maintenance of such a disorder. Bipedality is hypothesized to have emerged for a variety of different reasons, many of which would have certainly conferred fitness advantages. It may increase viewing distance, which can be beneficial in hunting and foraging as well as protection from predators or other humans; it makes long-distance travel more efficient for foraging or hunting; and it facilitates terrestrial feeding from grasses, trees, and bushes. Given the many benefits of bipedality which depends on a particularly formed spine, it is likely that selection for bipedalism played a large role in the development of the spine as we see it today, in spite of the potential for &quot;scoliotic deviations&quot;. According to the fossil record, scoliosis may have been more prevalent among earlier hominids such as &quot;Australopithecus&quot; and &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, when bipedality was first emerging. Their fossils indicate that there may have been selected over time for a slight reduction in lumbar length to what we see today, favoring a spine that could efficiently support bipedality with a lower risk of scoliosis.

==Society and culture==
The cost of scoliosis involves both monetary loss and lifestyle limitations that increase with severity. Respiratory deficiencies may arise from thoracic deformities and cause abnormal breathing. This directly affects capacity for exercise and work, decreasing the overall quality of life.

In the United States, the average hospital cost for cases involving surgical procedures was $30,000 to $60,000 per person in 2010. As of 2006, the cost of bracing was up to $5,000 during rapid growth periods, when braces must be consistently replaced across multiple follow-ups.

The month of June is recognized as Scoliosis Awareness Month to highlight and spread awareness of scoliosis. It emphasizes its wide impact and the need for early detection.

==Research==
Genetic testing for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, which became available in 2009 and is still under investigation, attempts to gauge the likelihood of curve progression.

<doc id="129091" wikidata="Q3264171" url="?curid=129091" title="Love Is Strange">
<text>&quot;Love Is Strange&quot; is a crossover hit by American rhythm and blues duet Mickey &amp; Sylvia, which was released in late November 1956 by the Groove record label.

The song was based on a guitar riff by Jody Williams and was written by Bo Diddley under the name of his wife at the time, Ethel Smith; it was recorded by Bo and Buddy Holly, among others.

== Background and recordings ==
At a concert at Howard Theatre in Washington, D.C. Mickey and Sylvia heard Jody Williams play a guitar riff that Williams had played on Billy Stewart&#x27;s debut single &quot;Billy&#x27;s Blues&quot;. &quot;Billy&#x27;s Blues&quot; was released as a single in June 1956 . Sylvia Robinson claims that she and Mickey Baker wrote the lyrics, while Bo Diddley claims that he wrote them.

The first recorded version of &quot;Love Is Strange&quot; was performed by Bo Diddley, who recorded his version on May 24, 1956 with Jody Williams on lead guitar. This version was not released until its appearance on &quot;I&#x27;m a Man: The Chess Masters, 1955–1958&quot; in 2007. Mickey &amp; Sylvia&#x27;s version was recorded several months later on October 17, 1956. A second Mickey &amp; Sylvia studio recording, recorded some years after, featured now-legendary drummer Bernard &quot;Pretty&quot; Purdie on his first paid session gig.

== Charts and accolades ==
&quot;Love Is Strange&quot; peaked at #1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s most played by jockeys R&amp;B Singles chart on March 6, 1957 and #11 on the Hot 100. In 2004 &quot;Love Is Strange&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for its influence as a rock and roll single.

== Cover versions ==
=== Full covers and adaptations ===
===Samplings===
Part of the song was sampled for the 2012 Pitbull hit &quot;Back in Time&quot; from &quot;Men In Black 3&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The song was featured in the 1987 film &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; and included on the soundtrack, which is one of the best-selling albums of all time.

The spoken part is parodied by Eric Bloom and Buck Dharma of Blue Öyster Cult in a live recording of &quot;7 Screaming Diz-Busters&quot; on their 1975 album &quot;On Your Feet or on Your Knees&quot;:
&quot;Bloom:&quot; I know Lucifer so well I call him by his first name!
&quot;Dharma:&quot; What do you call him?
&quot;Bloom:&quot; I call him, hey Lu!
&quot;Dharma:&quot; And if he don&#x27;t answer?
&quot;Bloom:&quot; I say, hey Lu... lover boy...
The song is parodied in the 1973 New York Dolls song &quot;Trash&quot;, where singer David Johansen quotes &quot;Oh how do you call your loverboy? ... Trash!&quot; then later uses the same melody for several bars. 

The song is &quot;covered&quot; by the fictional Scottish band &quot;The Majestics&quot; in the BBC Television series &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; (1987), starring Emma Thompson, Robbie Coltrane, Maurice Roeves, Jake D&#x27;Arcy and Stuart McGugan. 

The spoken part is referenced by Lou Reed at the end of his song &quot;Beginning of A Great Adventure&quot; on his 1989 album &quot;New York&quot;. He had married Sylvia Morales in 1980.

The song appears also in the Dennis Potter 1993 TV miniseries &quot;Lipstick on Your Collar&quot; where Mickey and Sylvia become the two main characters.

It also gained a following after appearing in &quot;Deep Throat&quot; (1972). The song was also played in the Terrence Malick film &quot;Badlands&quot; (1973) and in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Casino&quot; when Robert De Niro sees Sharon Stone for the first time. The song also is played in the 2000 HBO hit show &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, season two, episode 6 (&quot;The Happy Wanderer&quot;). It can also be heard playing in the second episode of &quot;The Wire&quot;.

==History==

The Village of Glenwillow was carved out of Solon Township and established in 1893 as a company town by Austin Powder Company.

It moved its manufacturing operations to Athens, Ohio, and closed its Glenwillow plant in 1972. In the 1980s, the village installed infrastructural and utility improvements and added a industrial park. Served by the Solon City Schools, a system consistently rated as one of the 100 best schools in the U.S. by publications such as &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, the village has since experienced residential development. In the early 2000s, the village received significant investment through mixed-use development, including renovation of the former Austin Powder housing stock and general store into boutiques, a tavern, in conjunction with a new town center, village park and new housing in a town plan layout.

Much of the land area in Independence is used by the intersection of I-480 and I-77. The I-77/I-480 interchange is a four-level stack interchange, but locals often refer to as the cloverleaf, as it largely replaced a nearby interchange of that type. The larger interchange opened in 1940, but construction of the Willow Freeway, which became I-77, was stalled by World War II and was not completed until the 1950s. In the late 1970s, I-480 connected into I-77. The original 1939 cloverleaf is still in existence on Granger and Brecksville Roads. It is still in use today, generally for local traffic.

In the 1970s, the Rockside corridor was developed into offices and numerous hotels to help downtown Cleveland.

<text>Lakewood is a city in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States, on the southern shore of Lake Erie. Established in 1889, it is one of Cleveland&#x27;s historical streetcar suburbs and part of the Cleveland metropolitan area. The population was 50,942 at the 2020 census, making it the third largest city in Cuyahoga County, behind Cleveland and Parma.

==History==
===Establishment===
The area now called Lakewood was populated by the Ottawa, Potawatomi, Chippewa, Wyandot, Munsee, Delaware and Shawnee tribes until the Treaty of Ft. Industry pushed them west in 1805. Prior to the treaty, American settlers were prohibited from moving west of the Cuyahoga River. The treaty ceded 500,000 acres of some of the tribes&#x27; land to the United States for about $18,000 or 3.5 cents/acre. The Shawnee and Seneca, living with the Wyandot, were to get $1000 &quot;...every year forever hereafter.&quot;

In 1806, the area was formally surveyed as Rockport Township, Township 7, Range 14, of the Connecticut Western Reserve. It was purchased from the Connecticut Land Company by a syndicate of six men headed by Judson Canfield on April 4, 1807, for $26,084. In 1818, permanent settlement began with the arrival from Connecticut of James Nicholson. Other early pioneers included Jared Kirtland and Mars Wagar. Settlements were mostly along Detroit Avenue, a toll road operated by the Rockport Plank Company from 1848 to 1901, with large farms and properties extending north to Lake Erie. Making bricks and planting orchards were among the most prolific occupations until natural gas and oil wells were developed in the early 1880s. By 1819, 18 families lived in Rockport Township. Early settlers sustained their lives through farming. The land was ideal for fruit farming and many vineyards began to emerge. Current street names reflect this history such as Orchard Grove and Blossom Park. The most common occupations in Lakewood were farming and the building trades.

===Incorporation and growth===
A toll road was established from Cleveland to Lakewood by the Rockport Plank Road Company, operating from 1848 to 1901. Lakewood was incorporated as a village in 1889, and named for its lakefront location. In 1893, streetcars came from Cleveland to Lakewood with the construction of the Detroit Avenue line, followed by the Clifton Boulevard line in 1903 and the Madison Avenue line in 1916.

Under the Ohio Common School Act of April 9, 1867, three schools were allotted to East Rockport, called 6, 8, and 10; they were later designated East, Middle, and West. Each school had one teacher. As the community began to grow and more schools were required, the school board adopted the policy of honoring Ohio&#x27;s presidents by assigning their names to the school buildings. The Rocky River Railroad was organized in 1869 by speculators as an excursion line to bring Clevelanders to the resort area they developed at the mouth of the Rocky River. Financially unsuccessful as a pleasure and amusement venture, the line was sold to the Nickel Plate Railroad in 1881. The railroad line still exists today, running in an east–west direction north of Detroit Avenue.

Notably, Lakewood was home to two pioneering automobile manufacturers: Winton Motor Carriage Company (est. 1897) and Baker Motor Vehicle (1899). By 1906, the latter became the largest electric vehicle maker in the world at the time.

===Modern redevelopment===
Rockport Square was developed on the eastern end of the city in 2004 and incorporated residential townhouses all along Detroit Avenue.

Lakewood was accepted into the nationally renowned Ohio Main Street Program in 2005. In 2009, the American Institute of Architects and the Cleveland Restoration Society honored the City of Lakewood Department of Planning &amp; Development and LakewoodAlive with an award for Creative &amp; Effective Preservation Advocacy. Lakewood first introduced curbside recycling in 1989 and has one of the highest recycling rates in all of Ohio at 79% in 2009.

Lakewood operates a CERT program. This all-citizen emergency response program was created in 2005.

==Geography==

Lakewood is located about west of Downtown Cleveland. The city borders Lake Erie to the north, the Cleveland neighborhoods of Edgewater and Cudell to the east, and the neighborhoods of Jefferson and Kamm&#x27;s Corners to the south. It borders the suburb of Rocky River to the west at the Rocky River valley. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Neighborhoods===

Historical housing throughout the city and an active historical society are the norm in Lakewood. The &quot;Make Lakewood Beautiful&quot; program involves contests in which residents compete to make their homes look and resemble their original design and architecture, and awards are given to several homeowners each year. The city offers tours of the most famous homes in the spring, summer, and fall.
* Arts District - Centered around the Beck Center for the Arts, on the west side of Lakewood.
* Birdtown - Southeastern corner of Lakewood, a well-known 8-street residential district on the southeast side of the city that was built specifically for the workers of the nearby National Carbon Company in the 1890s. The houses are distinctive and most of the streets are named after birds. Birdtown was designated a National Register Historic District in 2006. It is adjacent to Madison Park, the former Union Carbide factory, and the W. 117th St. Rapid Transit Station. Many of the original houses built there were boarding houses. Birdtown achieved National Historic Register status in 2006.
* Clifton Boulevard - Lined with big trees and multi-family homes, apartment complexes, and 4×4 brick structures, and turn of the century single family colonials, the seven-lane Clifton Boulevard is one of the busiest streets in greater Cleveland.
* Clifton Park - The wealthiest neighborhood of Lakewood is situated in the northwestern corner of the city, and consists mostly of magnificent Victorian mansions. It is bounded by Sloane on the south, Webb Road on the east, the Rocky River on the west, and Lake Erie on the north. Built in the late 19th century, this area has been historically, and continues to be, home to many of greater Cleveland&#x27;s most prominent citizens. Includes the private Clifton Beach community.
* Downtown Lakewood - The main section of Lakewood is centered at Detroit Avenue and Warren Road. Downtown Lakewood spans from Bunts Avenue to the east and Arthur Avenue to the west along Detroit. This district was formally identified when Lakewood was chosen as a member of the national MainStreet program in 2005. The area is lined with office buildings, restaurants, and variety shops. Lakewood Library, the USPS, and the site of the former Lakewood Hospital are all located in this district.
* The Edge - This easternmost neighborhood includes many concert venues, pubs, and taverns.
*Victorian Village - This was named after the large Victorian homes on Grace, Clarence and Cohassett Avenues on the city&#x27;s east end. When constructed in the early 1900s, it served as residences for executives from the National Carbon Company.
* The Gold Coast - Collection of high rises on the northeast end of Lakewood, bordering Lake Erie.
* Rockport Square - Rockport Square (not to be confused with the former Rockport Township) is an urban renewal project along Detroit Avenue on the eastern side of the city. Construction began in 2004 of roughly 200 condos, lofts, and live-work spaces.
* West End - The West End is the westernmost neighborhood of Lakewood, along the Rocky River Reservation. In 2002, the administration of Mayor Madelaine Cain proposed to seize homes in this area using eminent domain, to replace them with retail development. After a citizen-led resistance attracted national media attention from &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, the West End proposal failed in a 2003 referendum.

The new medical center which included outpatient programs, an emergency department and wellness services opened across the street from the old hospital site in 2018. None of the 845 employees of Lakewood lost their jobs, as they were offered other positions in the Cleveland Clinic system. There was opposition to the closing from a citizens&#x27; group called &quot;Save Lakewood Hospital&quot; who contended that the city could find another entity to manage the hospital and keep it open.

Cleveland Clinic completed construction of a new one-story facility on Detroit Avenue in 2005, adjacent to Rockport Square. Cleveland Clinic began demolition in 2016 of a professional office building and garage in preparation for the construction of a new $34 million, 62,000 square foot family health building, which will serve as a replacement, in part, for Lakewood Hospital.

==Controversy over traffic fines==
Beginning under Prohibition, Linndale became notorious for its gambling and illicit alcohol. Criminals would &quot;lay low there to escape the big-city heat&quot; of Cleveland. After the construction of Interstate 71, however, the village became known as a speed trap, and for many years had the busiest, on a per-capita basis, Mayor&#x27;s Court in the State of Ohio. The village in the past has successfully defended its legal right to enforce the 60 mph speed limit on the of I-71 within its jurisdiction under the &quot;Home Rule&quot; provisions of the state constitution. The combination of traffic enforcement and Mayor&#x27;s Court has provided 80% of Linndale&#x27;s one million dollar annual budget, and underwritten its four full-time and ten part-time police officers.

On December 20, 2012, Governor John Kasich signed a bill into law effective March 22, 2013, that dissolved Linndale&#x27;s Mayor&#x27;s Court. A sergeant in the Linndale police department stated that traffic cases would subsequently be handled by nearby Parma.

In response to decreasing revenue, Linndale has installed speed cameras on its most heavily traveled non-interstate road Memphis Avenue and is processing some traffic violations locally instead of relying on Parma Municipal Court. Another attempt to increase revenue with a proposed increase in the village income tax from 2% to 2.5% failed in an 8-12 referendum vote.

In October 2017, Linndale was featured on the internationally syndicated NPR show &quot;This American Life&quot; in episode 629 entitled Expect Delays.

<text>Lyndhurst is a city in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States, and an eastern suburb of Cleveland. The population was 14,050 at the 2020 census. A small part of Lyndhurst was originally part of Mayfield Township.

==History==
The land currently comprising Lyndhurst was part of the Connecticut Western Reserve, obtained via treaty with the Iroquois tribe in 1796 by the Connecticut Land Company. In 1797, Moses Cleaveland named the area east of the Cuyahoga River &quot;Euclid,&quot; after the Greek Mathematician and Patron Saint of surveyors. Euclid Township was officially formed in 1809. Despite this, Lyndhurst&#x27;s population consisted mostly of Native American Indians until after the War of 1812.

In 1828 Euclid Township was divided into nine districts, with the present area of Lyndhurst becoming district four.

From 1877 the main traffic corridor has been Mayfield Road (U.S. Route 322). Initially a wood-planked toll road, it is now home to many retail establishments and restaurants.

The earliest industry was farming. As the area grew, it became known as Euclidville Village, the name changing to Lyndhurst Village in 1920 before Lyndhurst was formally incorporated as a city in 1921.

Population growth in Lyndhurst, which tapered during the Great Depression, skyrocketed during the postwar period, driven by both the baby boom and white flight from the urban center of Cleveland. Lyndhurst&#x27;s population peaked in the 1970s. By 1980, lacking large tracts of available land for development, and with a population shift to exurban communities, the population of Lyndhurst began to shrink. The 2010, population of Lyndhurst was 29% less than its peak during the 1970s.

<text>Moreland Hills is a village in eastern Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. The population was 3,466 at the 2020 census. An eastern suburb of Cleveland, it is part of the Cleveland metropolitan area.

==History==
In 1815, settlement began near the point where State Route 87 crosses the Chagrin River. Orange Township was established in 1820 and became known for its steam sawmills, cheese factories and farms. The village, which in 1831 was still part of Orange Township, was the birthplace of James A. Garfield, the 20th President of the United States. In 1897, the Cleveland-Chagrin Falls Railway spurred residential development in the area as it served as a commuter line to employment opportunities in Cleveland.

In the early 20th century, Orange Township was divided into five municipalities, Moreland Hills, Hunting Valley, Orange Village, Pepper Pike and Woodmere. Moreland Hills was incorporated as a village in 1929, encompassing the southeast quadrant of the original Orange Township. Moreland Hills adopted a village charter in 1972, defining the municipal corporation with a mayor-council form of government.

What is known as the Orange Conference in the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) took place from October 25–26, 1831, in what is now Moreland Hills. It occurred at the home of Serenes Burnett, located at the southeast corner of today&#x27;s Ohio Route 87 and Chagrin River Road (not the house that now occupies the site). The three leading figures in the church at that time, Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, and Oliver Cowdery were in attendance.

Moreland Hills is home to state historical landmark Hiram House, the country&#x27;s second settlement house after Hull House in Chicago. Hiram House moved its operations from Cleveland to its current site at Harvard Road and State Route 91 in the 1940s.

== Political controversy ==
Former mayor Trevor Elkins was accused of illegally using campaign funds for personal reasons from 2015 to 2019. Elkins spent $134,705 over the course of 651 occasions for personal expenditures when those funds cannot be used for such purposes, even if reimbursed by Elkins. He also paid a political consulting firm he owns $8,400 from campaign funds. The Franklin County Prosecutor&#x27;s Office is expected to take up the case and has said that a felony charge is &quot;fully on the table.&quot; The Ohio Elections Commission has voted to refer the case for prosecution by a vote of 5-2. Elkins also has admitted to misusing more than $134,100 of his campaign funds on 650 occasions from 2015 to 2019, using a campaign debit card to cover routine personal expenses. He said he always repaid the account and did not realize what he was doing was illegal until it was pointed out to him.

Former Newburgh Heights mayor Trevor Elkins, accused of elections-related offenses, agreed to plead guilty to three misdemeanor charges. According to the Franklin County Prosecutor&#x27;s Office, Elkins agreed that he will plead guilty to one count of attempted theft in office and two counts of attempted election falsification. He also agreed to step down from his position as mayor once he entered those guilty pleas. Prosecutors accused Elkins of dipping into his campaign account 650 times between 2015 and 2019, totaling more than $134,000. Elkins told the Ohio Elections Commission last month that he put his own money into the campaign account and sometimes withdrew it for personal use. &quot;It&#x27;s like a bank robbery,&quot; special prosecutor Brian Simms told FOX 8. &quot;You commit a bank robbery, and you return to the bank and give them back their money. Well, guess what? You still committed a bank robbery.&quot; The prosecutor&#x27;s office also says Elkins agreed to shut down his campaign account and can not run for any Cuyahoga County elected office for the 2024-2028 term.

Trevor Elkins is currently Mayor of Newburgh Heights again, as of the last election in 2024.

==Traffic enforcement==
Newburgh Heights is a nationally-known speed trap, employing traffic cameras along a very short stretch of Interstate 77 that runs through it. In addition, traffic cameras are employed in the stretch of Harvard Avenue that leads to the I-77 on ramp. The penalties range from $150.00 to $300.00.

Former mayor Trevor Elkins said in 2017 his village issues about 300 speeding tickets per week from using its one hand-held camera. He said the system is safer than when officers pull over speeding drivers, and he disagreed with critics who might say the camera is a cash grab. &quot;The people who are speeding are not victims,&quot; Elkins said. &quot;They were breaking the law, and they got caught.&quot; 25% of the city revenue comes from traffic tickets. The national average is at least ten times lower, at approximately 2%.

Mayor Elkins has stated publicly that he defends the use of the cameras and admits they generate revenue, and said in 2016, &quot;do I recognize that they generate revenue? Absolutely. Do I apologize for that? No.&quot;

As of July 3, 2019, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine signed into law legislation that reduces state funding for any city, town, or village operating red light or speed cameras by an amount equivalent to the fines collected. (The provision withholding state funding has been enjoined by the 8th District Court of Appeals) The law requires all appeals of tickets received through camera technology to be heard in court rather than by an administrative officer.

<text>Olmsted Falls is a city in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. The population was 8,582 at the 2020 census. A southwestern suburb of Cleveland, it is part of the Cleveland metropolitan area. The city&#x27;s main business district is located at the corners of Bagley and Columbia Roads and contains the Grand Pacific Junction, a historic district.

==History==

After the Revolutionary War, the area that later became Olmsted Township, from which Olmsted Falls (as well as most of North Olmsted) was subsequently created, was part of the Western Reserve, a strip of northeastern Ohio land stretching 120 miles west from the Pennsylvania border, that was claimed by Connecticut. In 1795, Connecticut sold most of that land to the Connecticut Land Company, which then divided it into townships and sold it by auction. Several bidders won the right to purchase what then was known as Township 6, Range 15, with the largest share of almost half of the township going to Aaron Olmsted, a sea captain from East Hartford, Connecticut. However, it took years for the sales to be consummated. Olmsted died in 1806, so when the sale of his land was completed in 1807, it went to his widow and three sons, who sold parts of the land to settlers. 

Although James Geer, who then lived in Columbia Township to the south, planted a crop of corn across the border in 1814, it was 1815 when he and his family moved into a small log house in Township 6, Range 15, to become the township’s first settlers in a section that later became part of Olmsted Falls. The township had several informal names, including Kingston, until 1823, when it was organized as a civil township called Lenox. However, because of confusion with another Lenox Township in Ashtabula County, one resident suggested renaming it Olmsted Township in honor of Aaron Olmsted. Olmsted’s son, Charles Hyde Olmsted, not only agreed to the request but was so pleased that he offered to send the community about 500 books from Connecticut by oxcart. Those books became known as the Oxcart Library. 

On April 7, 1856, Olmsted Falls was incorporated as a village from a portion of Olmsted Township. In 1857, the village doubled in size when it annexed Plum Creek, the unincorporated hamlet to the north. Olmsted Falls subsequently annexed other parts of Olmsted Township over the years. In 1970, voters in Olmsted Falls and Westview (also known as West View) voted to merge their two villages, which were roughly the same size, under the name Olmsted Falls. The merger became effective at the beginning of 1971. In 1972, the state recognized Olmsted Falls as Ohio’s 231st city because it had a population of more than 5,000 people. The city is governed by a charter with a mayor and council elected on a non-partisan basis.

Two railroads run through Olmsted Falls. CSX tracks, originally built in 1849, cross northeast-southwest through the southeastern corner of the city. Norfolk Southern tracks, originally built in 1853, cut east-west through the city. 

Olmsted Falls is part of the Olmsted Falls City School District, which also includes Olmsted Township and parts of Berea and Columbia Township.

Vitamix has its world headquarters in Olmsted Township right on the border with Olmsted Falls.

<text>Parma is a city in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. It is a suburb located south of Cleveland. As of the 2020 census, its population was 81,146. Parma is the seventh-most populous city in Ohio, the largest suburb in the state, and the second-largest city in Cuyahoga County.

==History==

===Greenbriar (1806–1826)===
In 1806, the area that would eventually become Parma and Parma Heights was originally surveyed by Abraham Tappan, a surveyor for the Connecticut Land Company, and was known as Township 6 - Range 13. This designation gave the town its first identity in the Western Reserve. Soon after, Township 6 - Range 13 was commonly referred to as &quot;Greenbriar&quot;, supposedly for the rambling bush that grew there. Benajah Fay, his wife Ruth Wilcox Fay, and their ten children, arrivals from Lewis County, New York, were the first settlers in 1816. It was then that Greenbriar, under a newly organized government seat under Brooklyn Township, began attending to its own governmental needs.

===Parma Township (1826–1924)===
Self-government started to gain in popularity by the time the new Greenbriar settlement contained twenty householders. However, prior to the establishment of the new township, the name Greenbriar was replaced by the name Parma. This was largely due to Dr. David Long who had recently returned from Italy and &quot;impressed with the grandeur and beauty...was reminded of Parma, Italy and...persuaded the early townspeople that the territory deserved a better name than Greenbriar.&quot;

Thus, on March 7, 1826, a resolution was passed ordering the construction of the new township. It stated,

On the same day, a public notice was issued to qualified electors by the County Commissioners. They met at the Samuel Freeman House on April 3, 1826, to elect township officers according to the law. It was then that the first eleven officers were elected to lead the new government.

During this time, Parma Township remained largely agricultural. The first schoolhouse was a log structure built on the hill at the northern corner of what is now Parma Heights Cemetery. A memorial plate on a stone marks the spot. In 1827, the township was divided into road districts. The Broadview Road of today was then known as Town Line Road as well as Independence Road. Ridge Road was known then as Center Road as it cut through the center of town. York Road was then known as York Street as arrivals from the state of New York settled there. Pearl Road then had many names which included Medina Wooster Pike, Wooster Pike, the Cleveland Columbus Road, and the Brighton and Parma Plank Road.

A stone house, built in 1849 and known as the Henninger House, was occupied by several generations of Henningers and is still standing today. The house rests on one of the higher points in Cuyahoga County, which provided visibility for the entire northeastern part of Parma Township. This was also the same site where the Erie Indians, centuries before, stood to read and send fire signals as well as pray to their spirits.

By 1850, the US census listed Parma Township&#x27;s population at 1,329. However, the rising population of the township had slowed over the decades. The Civil War affected Parma much as it did other towns and villages in the nation. Three out of four homes sent a father, sons, or sometimes both, to fight in the war. By 1910, the population of the township had increased to 1,631.

In 1911, Parma Heights, due to the temperance mood of the day, separated itself from the Parma Township after by a vote of 42 to 32 and was incorporated as a village comprising 4.13 square miles.

: &quot;A main reason for establishing the village of Parma Heights was to get a town marshal...There is one saloon in the territory...some pretty rough crowds Sundays have disturbed the quiet of the neighborhood...wanted it closed on Sundays. To do this they wished a town marshal. They couldn&#x27;t have a town marshal without becoming a village, so they became one.&quot;

===The Village of Parma (1924–1930)===
By 1920, the US census showed Parma Township had a population of just 2,345, but the following decade proved to be a time of significant growth and development for Parma. It was in the 1920s that Parma Township transformed from a farming community into a village. On December 15, 1924, Parma was incorporated as a village.

The largest and fastest growing development of that time was H. A. Stahl&#x27;s Ridgewood Gardens development, which started in 1919, continued through the 1920s, and into the 1930s. A resident of Shaker Heights, Ohio&#x27;s first Garden City, H. A. Stahl developed Ridgewood as an ambitious &quot;model village&quot; project patterned along the lines of and rivaling the earlier Shaker Heights project with &quot;churches, schools, motion picture theater, community house, and other features forming a part of all well-developed residence communities&quot;. Ridgewood was designed and marketed as a Garden City on 1,000 acres of land to accommodate about 40,000 residents &quot;325 feet above Lake Erie, in the healthiest section of the South Side, free from the smoke of industries, or the congestion and noises of sections nearer the Public Square.&quot;

===The City of Parma (1931–present)===
On January 1, 1931, Parma became a city with a population of 13,899. Whereas the incorporation of the village of Parma was met with much optimism, the newly established city of Parma faced the uncertainty of the Great Depression which had almost entirely stopped its growth. Money was scarce, tax income was limited, and some began to talk of annexation of both the city and school district to Cleveland. Both annexation issues, however, were soundly defeated as Parma voters overwhelmingly voted against them and silenced proponents of annexation. Not long after this, Parma was once again solvent due in large part to the newly created Gallagher Act, a 1936 Ohio law that aided cities threatened with bankruptcy and the determination of Parma&#x27;s Auditor, Sam Nowlin. By 1941, a building boom appeared to be underway in Parma just as the United States was about to enter World War II.

After World War II, Parma once again began to experience tremendous growth as young families began moving from Cleveland into the suburbs. Between 1950 and 1960, Parma&#x27;s population soared from 28,897 to 82,845. By 1956, Parma was unchallenged as the fastest growing city in the United States. The population peaked in 1970 at 100,216.

In 2016, Parma&#x27;s population had declined to 81,601, though it remains one of the Cleveland area&#x27;s top three destinations young adults (aged 22 to 34) are increasingly choosing as a place to live, along with Lakewood and downtown Cleveland and in 2016 was recognized by Businessweek as one of the best places to raise kids in Ohio.

==In popular culture==
===Moon Over Parma===
In the late 1980s, Bob McGuire penned a song entitled &quot;Moon Over Parma&quot;, about an eccentric courtship that traverses the various suburbs of Cleveland. The song first received wide exposure on &quot;Big Chuck and Lil&#x27; John&quot; during its &quot;New Talent Time&quot; segment. Though McGuire was given the shepherd&#x27;s crook, McGuire&#x27;s song was offered for free, in the form of sheet music, to those who wrote to the show requesting a copy.

&quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;’s opening credits of its first season consisted of a caricature of Drew Carey — consisting of his face and a yellow tie — singing &quot;Moon Over Parma&quot; with an abridgment and some minor lyrical changes.

Occasionally, during the 1960s and 1970s, Parma was the target of light-hearted jabs by local movie show hosts Ghoulardi, Hoolihan, Big Chuck and Lil’ John, and The Ghoul, due to its central European image promoted by the friendly rivalry between Ernie &quot;Ghoulardi&quot; Anderson and &quot;Big Chuck&quot; Schodowski and contrary to actual demographics. Ghoulardi, the horror host of late night Shock Theater at WJW-TV, Channel 8, in Cleveland from January 13, 1963, through December 16, 1966, made a series of shorts called &quot;Parma Place&quot; and focused on an alleged love of white socks, pink flamingos, chrome balls, kielbasa, pierogi and the polka.

===Novak v. City of Parma===

In March 2016, Anthony Novak, a resident of Parma, created a parody Facebook page superficially resembling the local police department&#x27;s official page, with outlandish, satirical posts easily distinguished from actual police public-affairs content. Despite the page being voluntarily removed after 12 hours, the Parma Police subsequently obtained warrants and raided Novak&#x27;s apartment in the middle of the night three weeks later, seizing electronic devices belonging Novak and his roommate, and arresting and jailing Novak for four days until he could make bail. Novak was charged with felony disruption of police operations, but was acquitted at trial; a subsequent lawsuit against the police for civil rights violations was rebuffed by the Sixth Circuit, citing qualified immunity. Novak&#x27;s appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court garnered legal briefs from the ACLU and Cato Institute, but gained notoriety because of a supporting brief filed by satirical website &quot;The Onion&quot;.

==History==
===&quot;Greenbriar&quot; (1806–1826)===

In 1806, the area that was to become Parma and Parma Heights was originally surveyed by Abraham Tappan, a surveyor for the Connecticut Land Company, and was known as Township 6 - Range 13. This designation gave the town its first identity in the Western Reserve. Soon after, Township 6 - Range 13 was commonly referred to as &quot;Greenbriar,&quot; supposedly for the rambling bush that grew there. Benajah Fay, his wife Ruth Wilcox Fay, and their ten children, arrivals from Lewis County, New York, were the first settlers in 1816. The area of Greenbriar that was to later become Parma Heights was first settled in 1817. It was around that time that Greenbriar, under a newly organized government seat under Brooklyn Township, began attending to its own governmental needs.

===Parma Township (1826–1911)===

Self-government started to gain in popularity by the time the new Greenbriar settlement contained twenty householders. However, prior to the establishment of the new township, the name Greenbriar was replaced by the name Parma. This was largely due to Dr. David Long who had recently returned from Italy and &quot;impressed with the grandeur and beauty...was reminded of Parma, Italy and...persuaded the early townspeople that the territory deserved a better name than Greenbriar.&quot;

Thus, on March 7, 1826, a resolution was passed ordering the construction of the new township. It stated,

: &quot;On the petition of sundry inhabitants for a new township to be organized and erected comprising No. 6 in the 13th Range. Ordered that said Township No. 6 in the 13th Range be set off and erected into a new Township by the name of Parma, to be bounded by the original lines of said Township.&quot;

On the same day, a public notice was issued to qualified electors by the County Commissioners. They met at the house of Samuel Freeman on April 3, 1826 to elect township officers according to the law. It was then that the first eleven officers were elected to lead the new government.

During this time, Parma Township remained largely agricultural. The first schoolhouse was a log structure built on the hill at the northern corner of what is now Parma Heights Cemetery. A memorial plate on a stone marks the spot. In 1827, the township was divided into road districts. The Broadview Road of today was then known as Town Line Road as well as Independence Road. Ridge Road was known then as Center Road as it cut through the center of town. York Road was then known as York Street as arrivals from the state of New York settled there. Pearl Road then had many names which included Medina Wooster Pike, Wooster Pike, the Cleveland Columbus Road, and the Brighton and Parma Plank Road.

A stone house, known as the Henninger House, was built in 1849, occupied by several generations of Henningers, and is still standing today. More than 160 years ago, this house rested on one of the highest points in Cuyahoga County which provided visibility for the entire northeastern part of Parma Township. This was also the same site that the Erie Indians, centuries before, also stood to read and send fire signals as well as pray to their spirits.

By 1850, the US census listed Parma Township&#x27;s population at 1,329. However, the rising population of the township had slowed over the decades. The Civil War affected Parma much like it did other towns and villages in the nation. Three out of four homes sent father or sons, or sometimes both, to fight in the war. By 1910, the population of the township had increased to 1,631.

===Village of Parma Heights (1911–1956)===

In 1911, Parma Heights, due to the temperance mood of the day, separated itself from the Parma Township by a vote of 42 to 32 and was incorporated as a village comprising 4.13 square miles.

: &quot;A main reason for establishing the village of Parma Heights was to get a town marshal...There is one saloon in the territory...some pretty rough crowds Sundays have disturbed the quiet of the neighborhood...wanted it closed on Sundays...To do this they wished a town marshal. They couldn&#x27;t have a town marshal without becoming a village, so they became one.&quot;

By 1920, census records show that Parma Heights contained 310 residents.

===City of Parma Heights (1956-Present)===

In December 1956, Parma Heights was incorporated as a city, under the administration of Roy F. Cappallo, Mayor.

On November 26, 2014, an early-morning fire destroyed the office of Mayor Mike Byrne and resulted in severe damage to city hall. Investigators determined the fire was intentionally set using a Molotov cocktail.

<text>Pepper Pike is a city in eastern Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. The population was 6,796 as of the 2020 census. A suburb of Cleveland, it is a part of the Cleveland metropolitan area.

== History ==
In 1763, sixteen pioneers settled the area along the eastern border of present-day Cuyahoga County. In 1763, Orange Township was established, which included the present municipalities of Pepper Pike, Hunting Valley, Moreland Hills, Orange Village and Woodmere. Orange Township was the birthplace of President James A. Garfield in 1831. By the late 1880s, dairy farming and cheese production became the primary industry of the township. In 1924, residents of the northwestern quadrant of Orange Township voted to separate, and the village of Pepper Pike was incorporated. The name &quot;Pepper Pike&quot; was supposedly selected after the Pepper family, who lived and worked along the primary transportation corridor (i.e., turnpike), although there are other theories about the name. Incorporated as a city in 1970, Pepper Pike operates under the mayor-council form of government. In the late 2000s, it was chosen as one of the top seven strangest city names by the World Book of Facts.

Homes in the city are required to have an area of one acre so that residents can enjoy bucolic surroundings. Pepper Pike has been named a &quot;Tree City USA&quot; several consecutive years by the National Arbor Day Foundation.

The RTA&#x27;s greenline was originally planned to extend from Green Road to Brainard in Pepper Pike, but financial setbacks in the 1930s prevented its completion. The arrival of I-271 in the 1960s cemented the region&#x27;s reliance on automobiles over the train system.

On November 15, 2019, a natural gas pipeline in Pepper Pike exploded.

<text>Rocky River is a city in western Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. A suburb of Cleveland, it is located along the shore of Lake Erie approximately west of downtown Cleveland. The city is named for the Rocky River that forms its eastern border. The population was 21,755 according to the 2020 census data results.

==Early history==
In the summer of 1764, British Colonel John Bradstreet led a force of more than 2,000 regular soldiers, American volunteers and native Americans as part of an attack to stop Pontiac’s Rebellion, which ended before Bradstreet could attack. His mission was revised to retrieval of prisoners, exploration and peacemaking. As the host of 60 boats and nine canoes attempted to find shelter in an increasing storm on Lake Erie, waves overcame the fleet, ruining 25 boats and damaging many others. Bradstreet and his men came ashore in what is now Bradstreet’s Landing Park in Rocky River on 18 October 1764. After tarrying three days, the diminished force returned to Ft. Niagara enduring significant hardship on their voyage. Rumors to the contrary, only one life was lost in the endeavor.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Most of Rocky River&#x27;s eastern border follows the river bearing its name, which runs through the Rocky River Reservation of the Cleveland Metroparks system, adjacent to the city&#x27;s eastern neighbor, Lakewood. A small strip of Cleveland itself also borders Rocky River; however, the two cities are not directly connected via road. Lake Erie lines the entire northern border of the city while the city of Fairview Park marks the southern border. On Rocky River&#x27;s western border are the cities of Bay Village to the northwest and Westlake to the southwest.

<text>Shaker Heights is a city in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 29,439. Shaker Heights is an inner-ring streetcar suburb of Cleveland, abutting the eastern edge of the city&#x27;s limits. It is a planned community developed by the Van Sweringen brothers, railroad moguls who envisioned the community as a suburban retreat from the industrial inner city of Cleveland.

==History==

Shaker Heights is home to the oldest house in Cuyahoga County, built in 1817 by Moses Warren. The name &quot;Shaker Heights&quot; has origins in two local sources. The community was laid out on land formerly owned by the North Union Community of the United Society of Believers in Christ&#x27;s Second Appearing, more commonly known as Shakers. &quot;Heights&quot; refers to the plateau east of Cleveland that rises sharply in elevation from 582 feet above sea level at the base of the Cedar Glen Parkway rising to 950 feet above sea level in nearby Cleveland Heights; Shaker Heights&#x27; elevation is 1050 feet above sea level.

Ralph Russell established the North Union Shaker Settlement in 1822 with just over 80 individuals. Between 1826 and 1854, the group dammed Doan Brook, which made Upper and Lower Lake, and established three grist and a sawmills. The colony peaked around 1850 with about 300 settlers, but subsequently faded away and was closed in 1889.

In 1905, the land was bought by brothers M.J. and O.P. Van Sweringen who envisioned the first garden styled suburb in Ohio for the site. The brothers constructed homes, set aside land for churches and schools, and planted trees. Originally referred to as Shaker Village, the community was incorporated in 1912 and reached city status in 1931.

Shaker Heights is known for its stringent building codes and zoning laws, which have helped to maintain the community&#x27;s housing stock and identity throughout the years. Approximately seventy-five percent of the city of Shaker Heights is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Shaker Village Historic District.

Efforts toward racial integration began in the late 1950s, with neighbors in the Ludlow Elementary School area working together to make integration successful. As a result, Shaker Heights avoided many of the problems created from practices such as blockbusting and white flight. In 1986, the city began the Fund for the Future of Shaker Heights, which offered loans for down payments for residents buying homes in segregated neighborhoods, which helped to create multi-ethnic neighborhoods. Today, the city maintains a housing assistance office that works with home buyers to achieve and maintain neighborhood integration.

Shaker Heights was a finalist for the All-America City Award in 1989.

Shaker Heights is drained by the Doan Brook watershed, and has several small artificial lakes: Horseshoe Lake, Green Lake, Lower Shaker Lake, and Marshall Lake. Horseshoe Lake and Lower Shaker Lake had been dammed by the Shakers, while developers added Green Lake and Marshall Lake, the latter named after drugstore chain owner W. A. Marshall, at a later point.

<text>Solon ( ) is a city in southeastern Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. The population was 24,262 at the 2020 census. A suburb of Cleveland, it is part of the Cleveland metropolitan area.

== History ==
In 1820, the first settlers arrived from Connecticut to live in part of the Connecticut Western Reserve. The township was named after Lorenzo Solon Bull, who was the son of Isaac Bull, one of the first settlers. Purportedly, the selection of young Lorenzo&#x27;s middle name was due to its derivation from the &quot;father of democracy&quot;, Solon, the lawmaker of Ancient Greece. The early settlers faced challenges common to pioneers, but in Solon, drainage and wetlands issues complicated settlement and agriculture. Overcoming these obstacles, Solon Township became an arable farming area, producing corn and wheat crops and supporting dairy farm] (including five cheese factories). By 1850, the population of Solon Township reached 1,034.

Because of nearby Cleveland&#x27;s position as a national hub of the railroad industry, rail also contributed greatly to Solon&#x27;s growth. In 1857, the Cleveland-Youngstown section of the Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad established a line running through Solon.

Laid out in a traditional New England plan, Solon, like many of the neighboring townships, established a public square in its town center. In conjunction with townships to the north, a north–south corridor was established through the town centers of Solon, Orange, and Mayfield townships (from south to north, respectively) and, accordingly, was named SOM Center Road (now Ohio 91). Solon Township included the current municipalities of the City of Solon and the villages of Bentleyville and Glenwillow. In 1927, Solon was incorporated as a village and later became a city in 1961, operated under the mayor-council form of government.

Solon was one of the first cities to use a comprehensive zoning plan and has been able to achieve a strong industrial base, while insulating its bedroom communities from industrial activities. Further, the city has primarily concentrated its commercial and retail districts in the town center, making them convenient to all residents. In addition to its planned use for corporate and residential areas, Solon has of city parks and recreational area, of Cleveland Metroparks (the South Chagrin Reservation) and three golf courses within its borders.

In 1991, the extension of a divided highway, US 422, was completed as an east–west corridor just north of its town center. US 422 enables easy access to many points throughout Northeast Ohio, providing a corridor extending from Cleveland through Solon and beyond Warren into Pennsylvania.

<text>South Euclid is a city in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. It is an inner-ring suburb of Cleveland located on the city&#x27;s east side. As of the 2020 census, the population was 21,883.

==History==

The land currently comprising South Euclid was part of the Western Reserve, obtained via treaty with the Iroquois confederation in 1796 by the Connecticut Land Company. In 1797, Moses Cleaveland named the area east of the Cuyahoga River Euclid, after the Greek mathematician and &quot;patron saint&quot; of surveyors. Euclid Township was officially formed in 1809. In 1828, Euclid Township was divided into nine districts, with South Euclid becoming district two.

The earliest industry was farming. But, by the 1860s, quarrying of the area&#x27;s rich Bluestone deposits replaced agriculture as the town&#x27;s economic mainstay. Two separate locations – one along Nine Mile Creek near present-day Quarry Park at South Belvoir and Monticello Boulevards, and the other along what is today part of the Euclid Creek reservation – were consolidated by Forest City Stone Company in the 1870s, creating one of the region&#x27;s largest producers of the stone. By the end of the 19th century, the northern section of the town had become known as Bluestone village.

Residents of South Euclid eventually wanted autonomy from the larger Euclid Township, and voted on October 13, 1917, to be incorporated as a village, with Edward C. Foote being elected the first mayor a few weeks on November 6. At the same time, with the decline of the Bluestone industry brought on by improvements to poured concrete, Bluestone village was absorbed into South Euclid.

South Euclid&#x27;s rapid economic and population growth continued in the early decades of the 20th century, partly driven by industry in nearby Cleveland. Due in part to funding by the WPA, which helped keep people employed through the Great Depression, the village continued to grow and was officially incorporated as a city in 1941.

Population growth, which tapered during the Depression era, skyrocketed during the postwar period, driven by both the baby boom and white flight from the urban center of Cleveland. South Euclid&#x27;s population peaked in the early 1970s. By 1980, lacking large tracts of available land for development, and with a population shift to exurban communities, the population of South Euclid began to shrink.

==Geography==
Acting approximately as a central point for the east side of the Greater Cleveland area, South Euclid is bordered by Cleveland, Cleveland Heights, University Heights, Beachwood, Lyndhurst, Richmond Heights, and Euclid.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

==Demographics==
Like Cleveland Heights to the west and University Heights to the south, South Euclid is racially integrated. A large portion of the city&#x27;s population consists of African-Americans, Italian-Americans, Jews, and immigrants from Russia and other former Soviet republics.

==Culture==

The historic William E. Telling mansion, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. served as home to the South Euclid-Lyndhurst branch of the nationally renowned Cuyahoga County Public Library system. A wing of this same building, which once served as the gardener&#x27;s quarters, houses the South Euclid - Lyndhurst Historical Society. In 2012, the CCPL announced plans to sell the Telling mansion and move the Library to a new facility at 1876 South Green Road. In September, 2013, the Library board voted to sell the Mansion to Cleveland investor Richard A. Barone. The mansion now houses the Museum of American Porcelain Art.

==Parks and recreation==

There are four city-owned public parks: Quarry (divided by Monticello Boulevard into distinct North and South sections), Victory, Bexley, and Oakwood.

Quarry has a splash/sprinkle park, Victory sand volleyball courts, and Bexley a swimming pool. Quarry, Victory, and Bexley have playground equipment, and all four parks permit picnicking (although grilling facilities only remain at Bexley&#x27;s pavilion and at Quarry North).
Quarry and Bexley both have baseball diamonds utilized by the city&#x27;s public baseball and softball leagues. Quarry Park North features a fenced off dog park, where canines can play unleashed, with a separate section for smaller dogs.

The southern portion of the Euclid Creek reservation of the Cleveland Metroparks is located in South Euclid. Nearby, the South Euclid War Memorial lists the names of those who died while serving in wartime.

South Euclid has partnered with nearby Lyndhurst to form several recreational groups, including clubs for soccer, youth football, youth softball and baseball, and basketball.

South Euclid ranked 10th out of the 114 largest cities in Ohio in terms of walkability.

==Education==
The South Euclid-Lyndhurst City School District consists of three elementary schools, one upper elementary school, one junior high school and Charles F. Brush High School. The city was formerly home to Regina High School from 1954 to 2010. The building was purchased by nearby Notre Dame College. A small portion of South Euclid is located within the Cleveland Heights-University Heights City School District.

There is one parochial elementary school, one Catholic college preparatory school, and one college located in South Euclid: St. John&#x27;s, a Lutheran school located on Mayfield Road which opened in the mid-1850s; The Lyceum, a Catholic coeducational, college preparatory school offering a classical curriculum for grades seven through twelve; and Notre Dame College, a Roman Catholic college located on Green Road, north of Cedar. Notre Dame was established in 1922 as an all-female institution. After 79 years, the college became coed in January 2001. In addition to their brick and mortar school, Notre Dame College offers online degree programs through the school&#x27;s online campus.

The Japanese Language School of Cleveland (JLSC; クリーブランド日本語補習校 &quot;Kurīburando Nihongo Hoshūkō&quot;), a weekend Japanese supplementary school for Japanese nationals and Japanese Americans, previously held its classes in Regina High School.

<text>Strongsville is a city in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States, and a suburb of Cleveland. As of the 2020 census, its population was 46,491.

The city&#x27;s nickname, Crossroads of the Nation, originated from the intersection between the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Southwestern Electric Line that connected Cleveland and Wooster, Ohio. As the railroad line ceased operation in 1931, the motto and city seal have been adapted to reflect the modern-day intersection of Interstate 71 and the Ohio Turnpike.

==History==
Founded by settlers arriving in the newly purchased Connecticut Western Reserve, the city was named after John Stoughton Strong, the group&#x27;s leader. He brought his oldest son, Emory Strong, his brother-in-law Elijah Lyman Sr., and Guilford Whitney, another relative of the Strongs. Along with Whitney came his daughter, her husband John Hilliard, and their daughter. Other pioneers in the group included William Fuller Jr., Obadiah Church, Zachariah Goodale, and George Fox Gilbert. They arrived in 1816 and cleared enough land to construct log cabins. The 25-square-mile area of land was surveyed and divided into lots for John Stoughton Strong to sell off by agreement with Oliver Ellsworth of Hartford, Connecticut. Strongsville officially became Township No. 5, 14th range on February 25, 1818. Strongsville then became a village in 1923 and was ultimately designated a city in 1961.

John Stoughton Strong, originally from Vermont, was instrumental in Strongsville&#x27;s establishment and early growth. He drew in settlers from New York, Pennsylvania, and New England by driving cattle that he obtained to markets in those states. In the following years, he oversaw the development of settlements, roads, businesses, schools, and churches. He had the first mill built in 1820 on the Rocky River in Albion. While it is no longer standing, the dam and foundation still exist in what is now Bonnie Park. He also brought in settlers with specialized skills, such as Dr. William Baldwin as the town doctor. The John Stoughton Strong House was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 24, 1980.

Many of the main streets in the city are named after other principal figures and landowners from the city&#x27;s history, e.g. Howe, Drake, Shurmer, and Whitney.

The Pomeroy House, built in 1847, was known as the Homestead for over a century. Alanson Pomeroy, the homeowner and prominent Strongsville resident, hosted members of the Congregational Church of which he was an active member, and opened his spare room to travelers. During the Civil War, the Homestead became a stop on the Underground Railroad, where he concealed runaway slaves on his property. From this residence in Strongsville, the runaway slaves were taken to boats on the Rocky River for passage to Canada. The Alanson Pomeroy House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in June of 1975. After a few years of renovation, it opened as Don&#x27;s Pomeroy House Restaurant &amp; Pub in 1980. Guests can dine in the library, the old dining room, the study, or the parlor. The pub is located downstairs and the upstairs bedrooms now serve as private dining rooms.

In 1853, John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s family moved to Strongsville. At the time, Rockefeller was only a child.

On April 11, 1965, an F4 tornado hit Strongsville; it was part of the 1965 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak.

===2013 Strongsville City Teachers&#x27; Strike===
The Strongsville City Teachers&#x27; Strike was a labor strike organized by the Strongsville Education Association that lasted for eight weeks.

The strike commenced at 12:01 a.m. on March 4, 2013. The dispute is over a number of issues, notably teacher contracts, pay step increases, health insurance premium costs, and general working conditions. The Strongsville Education Association claims the Board does have the money to meet the teachers&#x27; salary requirements, but that &quot;the &#x27;projection&#x27; figures released by the Board on its website are no more than arbitrary, meaningless figures.&quot; The Strongsville Board of Education attests that the district is currently &quot;operating in the red&quot;, meaning the district budget deficit will increase drastically if the status quo remains. Several rounds of negotiations over said issues between the S.E.A. and the B.O.E. have taken place since March 2010. The strike ended after eight weeks.

<doc id="129126" wikidata="Q597623" url="?curid=129126" title="Antoni Kępiński">
<text>Antoni Ignacy Tadeusz Kępiński (16 November 1918 – 8 June 1972) was a Polish psychiatrist and philosopher. In his youth he was influenced by Carl Jung&#x27;s approach. He is known as the originator of concepts like information metabolism (IM) and axiological psychiatry.

==Biography==
Kępiński was born in Dolina, which at that time was part of Poland (now southwestern Ukraine). During the childhood years, he resided in Nowy Sącz where his father held the position of starosta. He attended the élite Bartłomiej Nowodworski High School in Kraków. In 1936, Kępiński entered the Medical Faculty of the Jagiellonian University. In 1939, he interrupted his studies before graduation and volunteered for the Polish Army to defend his country from the impending Invasion of Poland. After the simultaneous Invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Kępiński was captured and imprisoned in Hungary, to where he had fled. In 1940, he managed to escape imprisonment and headed to France, then Spain, where he was imprisoned in Miranda del Ebro.

Later he was freed and moved to the United Kingdom, spending a short time with the Polish Air Force in Great Britain. In 1944–1945, he continued his medical studies at University of Edinburgh&#x27;s Polish School of Medicine, graduating in 1946. He then returned to Poland and took up psychiatry at the Psychiatric Clinic in the &quot;Collegium Medicum&quot; of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. Shortly before his death in 1972 he was appointed professor in the faculty.

As a concentration camp inmate himself, Kępiński took part in a rehabilitation programme for survivors from the Auschwitz concentration camp.

==His work==
===Auschwitz syndrome===
Due to his involvement, in the 1950s, in the rehabilitation programme for former concentration camp inmates, Kępiński may be regarded as the pioneer of the PTSD research. The idea of such research originated in the mind of Kępiński&#x27;s colleague Stanisław Kłodziński. Together with fellow researchers from the Psychiatric Clinic of the Medical Academy in Cracow they examined large number of Auschwitz-Birkenau survivors and mapped out the clinical picture of the concentration camp syndrome which they called the &quot;KZ-Syndrome&quot;. As noted by psychiatrist Krzysztof Rutkowski, the same syndrome was later investigated in other countries (for example in the United States after the Vietnam War in the 1970s), and is currently known as the post-traumatic stress disorder.

===The specificity of psychiatric examination===
Co-workers and biographers of Kępiński emphasize that the key characteristic of his professional activity was his unique approach to the patient, inspired by the philosophy of dialogue. Part of his writings is devoted to peculiarities and subtleties of the psychiatric examination. In his view, diagnosis and therapy should not be based solely on logical analysis, as the inclusion of the emotional dimension is indispensable in psychology. Therefore, the therapist should form an emotional relationship with the patient, based on empathy and trust. The hierarchy in such relationship should be more or less horizontal, as both parties can learn a lot from each other. The general attitude of the therapist should encourage the patient to share experiences, feelings and thoughts without the fear of being judged. In such way, the doctor obtains the chance to better understand the structure and beauty of the inner world of the patient and to establish an appropriate base for the diagnosis. Wearing masks, assuming the position of superiority and being inauthentic during the therapeutic interaction are the most significant mistakes made by therapists.

===Axiological psychiatry===
In philosophy, axiology is the theory of value. According to Kępiński, the problem of value is of the greatest importance in psychiatry. It has two dimensions. Firstly, there are certain ethical values which should guide the doctors in their medical practice. Secondly, the therapeutic process in psychiatry should lead to reorganization or rebuilding of the hierarchy of values in the patient.

Kępiński&#x27;s bioethics were derived directly from The Hippocratic Oath. He restated the widely held view, that the main goal of the psychiatrist is to bring relief to patients. Being a physician is a type of mission or calling rather than an ordinary paid occupation. A key value to be upheld is hope. Without it, the actions undertaken by the doctors can become meaningless. Moreover, patients can sometimes recognise perplexity in the face of their physician. Hence whether improvement is realistic should always guide the medical profession.

Another axiological theme in Kępiński&#x27;s psychiatry was his view on the nature of psychoses, especially schizophrenia. According to that view, psychosis may be seen as distortions of the hierarchy of values which is one of the key aspects of the information metabolism process occurring in the organism of the patient. He contended that therapeutic work could lead to the formation of a healthy hierarchy of values, allowing the patient to interact with reality in a more balanced manner. His axiological take on psychopathology was seen as something unique and new in Polish psychiatry. It opened the way for new directions of research, such that some reviewers recognised Kępiński&#x27;s works as the foundation for a new branch of psychiatry.

===Information metabolism===

Information metabolism is a psychological theory of interaction between biological organisms and their environment based on information processing. The most detailed description of information metabolism concept was given by Kępiński in his book &quot;Melancholy&quot; (1974). In this model, the living organism is considered an open system as understood by von Bertalanffy. Living beings are characterized by ability to increase and maintain their own negentropy - an idea popularized in Schrödinger&#x27;s book &quot;What is life?&quot;. This ability makes the difference between them and inanimate objects which obey the increase of entropy principle. The body retains the same basic structure, although its building elements (molecules) are replaced quite frequently in anabolic and catabolic processes. The energy derived from food and oxygen is spent on securing the integrity of the organism. To refer to anabolic and catabolic processes in cells Kępiński used the term &quot;energy metabolism&quot;. Any activity of an organism is an informational sign to other beings. Activities in the physical realm are reactions to changes perceived in the external or internal reality of the organism. Bearing that in mind, the psyche can be seen as the information-processing unit. As emphasized by Kępiński, psychological structure of an individual remains relatively stable despite an ongoing exchange of information, analogically to the physical structure subject to energy metabolism.
In his books, Kępiński explained various mental conditions as disorders and imbalances of the information metabolism in general and its inherent value structure in particular. During his life, Kępiński mentioned that his model of information metabolism is not complete. The work upon it was interrupted by his illness and death.

===Kępiński as philosopher===
As a young medic, Kępiński was drawn to the works of Carl Jung and subjected the more &quot;mystical&quot; aspects to a critique which inspired him to launch on his own clinical and philosophical quest. Despite being essentially of a scientific turn of mind, Kępiński&#x27;s works invoked great interest among Polish philosophers, most notably Józef Tischner, who greatly appreciated his anthropological insights. Kępiński was not afraid of hypothesizing about the most difficult philosophical problems such as the nature of life, the problem of free will, consciousness and human autonomy. On the other hand, he was skeptical about methods and theories which lacked a sufficiently solid scientific basis, e.g. psychoanalysis, and rejected various forms of what he dismissed as &quot;magical thinking&quot; in psychology. Kępiński argued that human ethics are not socially-constructed but rooted in biology and their prerequisites can be found in the animal world. He strongly rejected every form of ideology and extensively commented on the destructive impact of ideologies on human history. Tischner emphasized that many interesting ideas found in Kępiński&#x27;s works are taken from other thinkers. He recognized information metabolism and axiological psychiatry as two truly original ideas of Kępiński. Kępiński&#x27;s disciple - psychiatrist Jacek Bomba - noted that the greatest value of his information metabolism theory is its quality of being an accurate and comprehensive synthesis of knowledge from neurophysiology, psychology, social science and medicine.

Kępiński maintained a good relationship with phenomenologist, Roman Ingarden, a prominent disciple of Edmund Husserl. The influence of phenomenology is apparent in his approach to human psychology. It may be regarded as his second favorite analytical tool, next to the scientific approach.

<text>Ansonia is a village in Darke County, Ohio, United States. The population was 1,160 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Ansonia was founded in 1845 under the name of &quot;Dallas.&quot; The village initially grew slowly; significant expansion only came after the coming of a railroad in 1852. Because dense swamps hindered settlement in the vicinity, woodland was plentiful, and Ansonia became a center of manufacturing for hardwood products. In 1873, the residents replaced their old school with a substantial two-story building at the cost of ten thousand dollars; this building was the first home of Ansonia High School, which was founded in that year. In turn, this building was demolished and a replacement erected in 1903. Another prominent structure in the village was a mausoleum; built of marble in 1911, it was the first mausoleum in Darke County.

In its early decades, Ansonia was heavily influenced by Freemasonry. The community&#x27;s first lodge was chartered on October 21, 1874, with a membership of sixteen; in its first forty years, this lodge expanded nearly eightfold. An IOOF lodge was instituted on June 18, 1875, with sixteen members; it grew nearly sevenfold in its first forty years. Sixteen women in the community founded a chapter of the Daughters of Rebekah in 1894, and a lodge of the Knights of Pythias was also established in the village in 1889.

Gunder instructed the men to &quot;select a name and have one that is not on the map of the globe.&quot; Between the first requirement and the dark, foggy November weather, the men chose &quot;Arcanum,&quot; which conveniently means &quot;secret, hidden.&quot; A post office has been in operation at Arcanum since 1852.

<text>Castine ( ) is a village in Darke County, Ohio, United States. The population was 110 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Castine was platted in 1832 and replatted in the following year. Its location was chosen because it lay at the intersection of the road between Greenville and Eaton with the road between the communities of Miami County, Ohio and New Garden, Indiana. For its first few decades, the village (then known as &quot;New Castine&quot;) grew and prospered, but the building of the Little Miami Railroad through West Manchester, to the south, retarded Castine&#x27;s progress. Revival came with the construction of the Cincinnati Northern Railroad in 1894.

<text>Gettysburg is a village in Darke County, Ohio, United States. The population was 463 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Gettysburg was founded by natives of Adams County, Pennsylvania, in the late 1820s. When the settlement was platted by John Hershey in 1842, the community was named for Gettysburg, the county seat of Adams County. The community&#x27;s first church was a congregation of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, established in 1847 or 1848, while the first school was built in 1850.

By the 1860s the village had an active business sector including general stores, shoe shops, cabinet makers, wagon/carriage shops, harness shops, tanning yards, cooperages, blacksmiths, tinning shop, tailors, physicians, a hotel, grain elevator, flouring and saw mills. Several saloons opened but soon failed.

Around 1863 the Richmond and Covington Railroad (becoming part of the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1921) constructed a rail line that ran through Gettysburg. Early in the morning of April 30, 1865, Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Funeral Train passed through the village on its journey to his burial place in Springfield, IL.

The railroad turned the town into a busy shipping point for agricultural products. For example, in 1907 one hundred and sixty-eight rail cars of tobacco valued at over one million dollars were shipped out. Also that year 398 carloads of grain valued at $300,000 were shipped from the town&#x27;s grain elevators. The rail line was abandoned in the 1980s and a portion of the railway corridor is now used for the Tecumseh Trail Multi-use Pathway, a popular recreation trail.

In 1922 Ira Petersime, a local businessman and entrepreneur, invented the electric poultry incubator. In short time Petersime and his son, Ray, built a manufacturing plant in Gettysburg and began shipping their incubators and other hatchery equipment all over the country and abroad. Their business grew to be one of the largest manufacturers of poultry incubators in the world. In 1933 a local historian commented that “the Petersime Incubator Co. put Gettysburg on the map of the world”. The business closed in 2006.

<text>Greenville is a city in and the county seat of Darke County, Ohio, United States. It is located near Ohio&#x27;s western edge, about northwest of Dayton. The population was 12,786 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Indigenous tribes in the region included the Wyandot, the Delaware, the Shawnee, the Ottawa, the Chippewa, the Pottawatomi, the Miami, the Wea, the Kickapoo, the Piankasha, the Kaskaskia and the Eel River. These participated in the Northwest Indian War, their effort to repel European Americans from the Northwest Territory.

Greenville is the historic location of Fort Greene Ville, built in November 1793 by General Anthony Wayne&#x27;s Legion of the United States during the Northwest Indian War. Named for Revolutionary War hero Nathaniel Greene, its defenses covered about , making it North America&#x27;s largest wooden fort. It was a training ground and base of operations for the ~3000 soldiers of the Legion and Kentucky Militia before their August 1794 march northward to the Battle of Fallen Timbers. A year after the battle, the Treaty of Greenville was signed at the fort on August 3, 1795, with chiefs of the tribes that had confronted the U.S. This brought an end to the Indian wars in the area and opened the Northwest Territory for European-American settlement.

In 1805 or 1806, the Shawnee chief Tecumseh and his younger brother Tenskwatawa established an illegal settlement in Greenville. In peaceful protest of the boundary line of the Treaty of Greenville, their group occupied the confluence of Mud Creek and Greenville Creek until 1808. Under pressure from William Henry Harrison, territorial governor of Indiana, and the burgeoning population of settlers, Tecumseh, Tenskwatawa, and their followers relocated to Prophetstown, Indiana, near which the intertribal confederacy was shattered at the Battle of Tippecanoe. Tenskwatawa visited Greenville by request in 1826 as he accompanied the Shawnee during their removal by the U.S. Army.

The Army abandoned Fort Greenville in 1796; it was partly burned later that year to retrieve nails used in its construction. Local settlers carried away some of its logs for building the new settlement of Dayton, Ohio, to the south. In the War of 1812, the Army refitted what remained of the fort; it was used as a supply depot and staging area. The earliest European-American settlers came in 1807; the city of Greenville was officially founded in August 1808.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

Local airports include Darke County Airport, seven miles away in Versailles, and James M. Cox Dayton International Airport, 35 miles away in Dayton, Ohio.

<text>Hollansburg is a village in Darke County, Ohio, United States. The population was 243 at the 2020 census.

==History==
On March 28, 1838, local landowner James Stewart platted a community in northwestern Harrison Township and named it &quot;Union.&quot; When William Hollaman, another landowner, attempted to purchase lots in the settlement, a dispute erupted between the two men; seven months later, Hollaman attempted to avenge himself by platting another community only to the northeast of Union, to which a third landowner, Valentine Harland, quickly made additions. The new community was given the name of &quot;Hollansburg&quot; as a portmanteau of the owners&#x27; names — Hollaman and Harland. Within a year, a countryside post office named &quot;Republican&quot; was moved to Hollansburg, and the village quickly began to outgrow Union; the two communities ultimately merged. The first church in the village, a Church of Christ, was founded in 1840, while the first school building was erected in 1848.

<doc id="129139" wikidata="Q520127" url="?curid=129139" title="Periodontal disease">
<text>Periodontal disease, also known as gum disease, is a set of inflammatory conditions affecting the tissues surrounding the teeth. In its early stage, called gingivitis, the gums become swollen and red and may bleed. It is considered the main cause of tooth loss for adults worldwide. In its more serious form, called periodontitis, the gums can pull away from the tooth, bone can be lost, and the teeth may loosen or fall out. Halitosis (bad breath) may also occur.

Periodontal disease typically arises from the development of plaque biofilm, which harbors harmful bacteria such as &quot;Porphyromonas gingivalis&quot; and &quot;Treponema denticola&quot;. These bacteria infect the gum tissue surrounding the teeth, leading to inflammation and, if left untreated, progressive damage to the teeth and gum tissue. Recent meta-analysis have shown that the composition of the oral microbiota and its response to periodontal disease differ between men and women. These differences are particularly notable in the advanced stages of periodontitis, suggesting that sex-specific factors may influence susceptibility and progression. Factors that increase the risk of disease include smoking, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, family history, high levels of homocysteine in the blood and certain medications. Diagnosis is by inspecting the gum tissue around the teeth both visually and with a probe and X-rays looking for bone loss around the teeth.

Treatment involves good oral hygiene and regular professional teeth cleaning. Recommended oral hygiene include daily brushing and flossing. In certain cases antibiotics or dental surgery may be recommended. Clinical investigations demonstrate that quitting smoking and making dietary changes enhance periodontal health. Globally, 538 million people were estimated to be affected in 2015 and has been known to affect 10–15% of the population generally. In the United States, nearly half of those over the age of 30 are affected to some degree and about 70% of those over 65 have the condition. Males are affected more often than females.

==Signs and symptoms==

In the early stages, periodontitis has very few symptoms, and in many individuals the disease has progressed significantly before they seek treatment.

Symptoms may include:
* Redness or bleeding of gums while brushing teeth, using dental floss or biting into hard food (e.g., apples) (though this may also occur in gingivitis, where there is no attachment loss gum disease)
* Gum swelling that recurs
* Spitting out blood after brushing teeth
* Halitosis, or bad breath, and a persistent metallic taste in the mouth
* Gingival recession, resulting in apparent lengthening of teeth (this may also be caused by heavy-handed brushing or with a stiff toothbrush)
* Deep pockets between the teeth and the gums (pockets are sites where the attachment has been gradually destroyed by collagen-destroying enzymes, known as collagenases)
* Loose teeth, in the later stages (though this may occur for other reasons, as well)

Gingival inflammation and bone destruction are largely painless. Hence, people may wrongly assume painless bleeding after teeth cleaning is insignificant, although this may be a symptom of progressing periodontitis in that person. 
===Associated conditions===
Periodontitis has been linked to increased inflammation in the body, such as indicated by raised levels of C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. It is associated with an increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis and hypertension. It is also linked in those over 60 years of age to impairments in delayed memory and calculation abilities. Individuals with impaired fasting glucose and diabetes mellitus have a higher degrees of periodontal inflammation and often have difficulties with balancing their blood glucose level, owing to the constant systemic inflammatory state caused by the periodontal inflammation. Although no causal association was proven, there is an association between chronic periodontitis and erectile dysfunction, inflammatory bowel disease, and heart disease.
==== Diabetes and periodontal disease ====
A positive correlation between raised levels of glucose within the blood and the onset or progression of periodontal disease has been shown in the current literature.

Data has also shown that there is a significant increase in the incidence or progression of periodontitis in patients with uncontrolled diabetes compared to those who do not have diabetes or have well-controlled diabetes. In uncontrolled diabetes, the formation of reactive oxygen species can damage cells such as those in the connective tissue of the periodontal ligament, resulting in cell necrosis or apoptosis. Furthermore, individuals with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus who have frequent exposure to periodontal pathogens have a greater immune response to these bacteria. This can subsequently cause and/or accelerate periodontal tissue destruction leading to periodontal disease.

===Oral cancer and periodontal disease===

Current literature suggests a link between periodontal disease and oral cancer. Studies have confirmed an increase in systemic inflammation markers such as C-Reactive Protein and Interleukin-6 to be found in patients with advanced periodontal disease. The link between systemic inflammation and oral cancer has also been well established.

Both periodontal disease and cancer risk are associated with genetic susceptibility and it is possible that there is a positive association by a shared genetic susceptibility in the two diseases.

Due to the low incidence rate of oral cancer, studies have not been able to conduct quality studies to prove the association between the two, however future larger studies may aid in the identification of individuals at a higher risk.

===Systemic implications===

Periodontal disease (PD) can be described as an inflammatory condition affecting the supporting structures of the teeth. Studies have shown that PD is associated with higher levels of systemic inflammatory markers such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF). To compare, elevated levels of these inflammatory markers are also associated with cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular events such as ischemic strokes.

The presence of a wide spectrum inflammatory oral diseases can increase the risk of an episode of stroke in an acute or chronic phase. Inflammatory markers, CRP, IL-6 are known risk factors of stroke. Both inflammatory markers are also biomarkers of PD and found to be an increased level after daily activities, such as mastication or toothbrushing, are performed. Bacteria from the periodontal pockets will enter the bloodstream during these activities and the current literature suggests that this may be a possible triggering of the aggravation of the stroke process.

Other mechanisms have been suggested, PD is a known chronic infection. It can aid in the promotion of atherosclerosis by the deposition of cholesterol, cholesterol esters and calcium within the subendothelial layer of vessel walls. Atherosclerotic plaque that is unstable may rupture and release debris and thrombi that may travel to different parts of the circulatory system causing embolization and therefore, an ischemic stroke. Therefore, PD has been suggested as an independent risk factor for stroke.

A variety of cardiovascular diseases can also be associated with periodontal disease. Patients with higher levels of inflammatory markers such as TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 can lead to progression of atherosclerosis and the development and perpetuation of atrial fibrillation, as it is associated with platelet and coagulation cascade activations, leading to thrombosis and thrombotic complications.

Experimental animal studies have shown a link between periodontal disease, oxidative stress and cardiac stress. Oxidative stress favours the development and progression of heart failure as it causes cellular dysfunction, oxidation of proteins and lipids, and damage to the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), stimulating fibroblast proliferation and metalloproteinases activation favouring cardiac remodelling.

During SARS Covid 19 pandemic, Periodontitis was significantly associated with a higher risk of complications from COVID‐19, including ICU admission, need for assisted ventilation and death and increased blood levels of markers such as D‐dimer, WBC and CRP which are linked with worse disease outcome.

== Clinical significance ==
=== Inadequate nutrition and periodontal disease ===
Periodontal disease is multifactorial, and nutrition can significantly affect its prognosis. Studies have shown that a healthy and well-balanced diet is crucial to maintaining periodontal health. Nutritional deficiencies can lead to oral manifestations such as those in scurvy and rickets disease. 
Different vitamins will play a different role in periodontal health:
* Vitamin C: Deficiencies may lead to gingival inflammation and bleeding, subsequently advancing periodontal disease
* Vitamin D: Deficiencies may lead to delayed post-surgical healing
* Vitamin E: Deficiencies may lead to impaired gingival wound healing
* Vitamin K: Deficiencies may lead to gingival bleeding
Nutritional supplements of vitamins have also been shown to positively affect healing after periodontal surgery and many of these vitamins can be found in a variety of food that we eat within a regular healthy diet. 
Therefore, vitamin intakes (particularly vitamin C) and dietary supplements not only play a role in improving periodontal health, but also influence the rate of bone formation and periodontal regeneration. However, studies supporting the correlation between nutrition and periodontal health are limited, and more long-term research is required to confirm this.

== Causes ==
Periodontitis is an inflammation of the periodontium, i.e., the tissues that support the teeth. The periodontium consists of four tissues:
* gingiva, or gum tissue,
* cementum, or outer layer of the roots of teeth,
* alveolar bone, or the bony sockets into which the teeth are anchored, and
* periodontal ligaments (PDLs), which are the connective tissue fibers that run between the cementum and the alveolar bone.

The primary cause of gingivitis is poor or ineffective oral hygiene, which leads to the accumulation of a mycotic and bacterial matrix at the gum line, called dental plaque. Other contributors are poor nutrition and underlying medical issues such as diabetes. Diabetics must be meticulous with their homecare to control periodontal disease. New finger prick tests have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the US, and are being used in dental offices to identify and screen people for possible contributory causes of gum disease, such as diabetes.

In some people, gingivitis progresses to periodontitis — with the destruction of the gingival fibers, the gum tissues separate from the tooth and deepened sulcus, called a periodontal pocket. Subgingival microorganisms (those that exist under the gum line) colonize the periodontal pockets and cause further inflammation in the gum tissues and progressive bone loss. Examples of secondary causes are those things that, by definition, cause microbic plaque accumulation, such as restoration overhangs and root proximity.
Smoking is another factor that increases the occurrence of periodontitis, directly or indirectly, and may interfere with or adversely affect its treatment. It is arguably the most important environmental risk factor for periodontitis. Research has shown that smokers have more bone loss, attachment loss and tooth loss compared to non-smokers. This is likely due to several effects of smoking on the immune response including decreased wound healing, suppression of antibody production, and the reduction of phagocytosis by neutrophils

Ehlers–Danlos syndrome and Papillon–Lefèvre syndrome (also known as palmoplantar keratoderma) are also risk factors for periodontitis.

If left undisturbed, microbial plaque calcifies to form calculus, which is commonly called tartar. Calculus above and below the gum line must be removed completely by the dental hygienist or dentist to treat gingivitis and periodontitis. Although the primary cause of both gingivitis and periodontitis is the microbial plaque that adheres to the tooth surfaces, there are many other modifying factors. A very strong risk factor is one&#x27;s genetic susceptibility. Several conditions and diseases, including Down syndrome, diabetes, and other diseases that affect one&#x27;s resistance to infection, also increase susceptibility to periodontitis.

Periodontitis may be associated with higher stress. Periodontitis occurs more often in people in the lower classes than people in the upper classes.

Genetics appear to play a role in determining the risk for periodontitis. It is believed genetics could explain why some people with good plaque control have advanced periodontitis, whilst some others with poor oral hygiene are free from the disease. Genetic factors which could modify the risk of a person developing periodontitis include:
* Defects of phagocytosis: person may have hypo-responsive phagocytes.
* Hyper-production of interleukins, prostaglandins and cytokines, resulting in an exaggerated immune response. 
* Interleukin 1 (IL-1) gene polymorphism: people with this polymorphism produce more IL-1, and subsequently are more at risk of developing chronic periodontitis.
Diabetes appears to exacerbate the onset, progression, and severity of periodontitis. Although the majority of research has focused on type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes appears to have an identical effect on the risk for periodontitis. The extent of the increased risk of periodontitis is dependent on the level of glycaemic control. Therefore, in well managed diabetes there seems to be a small effect of diabetes on the risk for periodontitis. However, the risk increases exponentially as glycaemic control worsens. Overall, the increased risk of periodontitis in diabetics is estimated to be between two and three times higher. So far, the mechanisms underlying the link are not fully understood, but it is known to involve aspects of inflammation, immune functioning, neutrophil activity, and cytokine biology.

Hormonal fluctuations can also play a significant role in the development and progression of gingivitis and periodontitis. Changes in hormone levels, particularly during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, can lead to increased sensitivity and inflammatory responses in the gums. For example, elevated oestrogen and progesterone during pregnancy can heighten the inflammatory response to dental plaque, making pregnant individuals more susceptible to gingival disease. 

==Mechanism==
As dental plaque or biofilm accumulates on the teeth near and below the gums there is some dysbiosis of the normal oral microbiome. As of 2017 it was not certain what species were most responsible for causing harm, but gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, spirochetes, and viruses have been suggested; in individual people it is sometimes clear that one or more species is driving the disease. Research in 2004 indicated three gram negative anaerobic species: &quot;Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans&quot;, &quot;Porphyromonas gingivalis&quot;, &quot;Bacteroides forsythus&quot; and &quot;Eikenella corrodens&quot;.

Plaque may be soft and uncalcified, hard and calcified, or both; for plaques that are on teeth the calcium comes from saliva; for plaques below the gumline, it comes from blood via oozing of inflamed gums.

The damage to teeth and gums comes from the immune system as it attempts to destroy the microbes that are disrupting the normal symbiosis between the oral tissues and the oral microbe community. As in other tissues, Langerhans cells in the epithelium take up antigens from the microbes, and present them to the immune system, leading to movement of white blood cells into the affected tissues. This process in turn activates osteoclasts which begin to destroy bone, and it activates matrix metalloproteinases that destroy ligaments. So, in summary, it is bacteria which initiates the disease, but key destructive events are brought about by the exaggerated response from the host&#x27;s immune system.

==Classification==
There were several attempts to introduce an agreed-upon classification system for periodontal diseases: in 1989, 1993, 1999, and 2017.

=== 1999 classification ===
The 1999 classification system for periodontal diseases and conditions listed seven major categories of periodontal diseases, of which 2–6 are termed &quot;destructive&quot; periodontal disease, because the damage is essentially irreversible. The seven categories are as follows:

* Gingivitis
* Chronic periodontitis
* Aggressive periodontitis
* Periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease
* Necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis/periodontitis
* Abscesses of the periodontium
* Combined periodontic-endodontic lesions

Moreover, terminology expressing both the extent and severity of periodontal diseases are appended to the terms above to denote the specific diagnosis of a particular person or group of people.

====Severity====

The &quot;severity&quot; of disease refers to the amount of periodontal ligament fibers that have been lost, termed &quot;clinical attachment loss&quot;. According to the 1999 classification, the severity of chronic periodontitis is graded as follows:
* Slight: of attachment loss
* Moderate: of attachment loss
* Severe: ≥ of attachment loss

====Extent====

The &quot;extent&quot; of disease refers to the proportion of the dentition affected by the disease in terms of percentage of sites. Sites are defined as the positions at which probing measurements are taken around each tooth and, generally, six probing sites around each tooth are recorded, as follows:

* Mesiobuccal
* Mid-buccal
* Distobuccal
* Mesiolingual
* Mid-lingual
* Distolingual

If up to 30% of sites in the mouth are affected, the manifestation is classified as &quot;localized&quot;; for more than 30%, the term &quot;generalized&quot; is used.

=== 2017 classification ===
The 2017 classification of periodontal diseases is as follows:

Periodontal health, gingival disease and conditions

* Periodontal health and gingival health
** Clinical gingival health on an intact periodontium
** Clinical gingival health on an intact periodontium
*** Stable periodontitis
*** Non periodontitis person
*Gingivitis — Dental biofilm induced
**Associated with the dental biofilm alone
**Mediated by systemic and local risk factors
**Drug induced gingival enlargement.
*Gingival diseases — Non dental biofilm induced
**Genetic/developmental disorders
**Specific infections
**Inflammatory and immune conditions
**Reactive processes
**Neoplasms
**Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic
**Traumatic lesions
**Gingival pigmentation.

Periodontitis

*Necrotizing periodontal diseases
**Necrotizing Gingivitis
**Necrotizing periodontitis
**Necrotizing stomatitis
* Periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease
* Periodontitis

Other conditions affecting the periodontium

(Periodontal Manifestations of Systemic Diseases and Developmental and Acquired Conditions)

* Systemic disease of conditions affecting the periodontal support tissues
* Other Periodontal Conditions
** Periodontal abscesses
** Endodontic- periodontal lesions
*Mucogingival deformities and conditions
**Gingival Phenotype
**Gingival/Soft Tissue Recession
**Lack of Gingiva
**Decreased Vestibular Depth
**Aberrant Frenum/muscle position
**Gingival Excess
**Abnormal Color
**Condition of the exposed root surface
*Traumatic occlusal forces
**Primary Occlusal Trauma
**Secondary Occlusal Trauma
* Tooth and prosthesis related factors
** Localized tooth-related factors
** Localized dental prostheses-related factors

Peri-implant diseases and conditions

* Peri-implant health
*Peri-implant mucositis
*Peri-implantitis
* Peri-implant soft and hard tissue deficiencies

==== Staging ====
The goals of staging periodontitis is to classify the severity of damage and assess specific factors that may affect management.

According to the 2017 classification, periodontitis is divided into four stages; after considering a few factors such as:

* Amount and percentage bone loss radiographically
* Clinical attachment loss, probing depth
* Presence of furcation
* Vertical bony defects
* History of tooth loss related to periodontitis
* Tooth hypermobility due to secondary occlusal trauma

==== Grading ====
According to the 2017 classification, the grading system for periodontitis consists of three grades:

*Grade A: Slow progression of disease; no evidence of bone loss over last five years
*Grade B: Moderate progression; &lt; 2mm of bone loss over last five years
*Grade C: Rapid progression or future progression at high risk; ≥ 2mm bone loss over five years

Risk factors affecting which grade a person is classified into include:

*Smoking
* Diabetes

=== Periodontal probing ===

Dentists and dental hygienists measure periodontal disease using a device called a periodontal probe. This thin &quot;measuring stick&quot; is gently placed into the space between the gums and the teeth, and slipped below the gumline. If the probe can slip more than below the gumline, the person is said to have a gingival pocket if no migration of the epithelial attachment has occurred or a periodontal pocket if apical migration has occurred. This is somewhat of a misnomer, as any depth is, in essence, a pocket, which in turn is defined by its depth, i.e., a 2-mm pocket or a 6-mm pocket. However, pockets are generally accepted as self-cleansable (at home, by the person, with a toothbrush) if they are 3 mm or less in depth. This is important because if a pocket is deeper than 3 mm around the tooth, at-home care will not be sufficient to cleanse the pocket, and professional care should be sought. When the pocket depths reach in depth, the hand instruments and ultrasonic scalers used by the dental professionals may not reach deeply enough into the pocket to clean out the microbial plaque that causes gingival inflammation. In such a situation, the bone or the gums around that tooth should be surgically altered or it will always have inflammation which will likely result in more bone loss around that tooth. An additional way to stop the inflammation would be for the person to receive subgingival antibiotics (such as minocycline) or undergo some form of gingival surgery to access the depths of the pockets and perhaps even change the pocket depths so they become 3 mm or less in depth and can once again be properly cleaned by the person at home with his or her toothbrush.

== Prevention ==
Daily oral hygiene measures to prevent periodontal disease include:
*Brushing properly on a regular basis (at least twice daily), with the person attempting to direct the toothbrush bristles underneath the gumline, helps disrupt the bacterial-mycotic growth and formation of subgingival plaque.
*Flossing daily and using interdental brushes (if the space between teeth is large enough), as well as cleaning behind the last tooth, the third molar, in each quarter.
*Using an antiseptic mouthwash: Chlorhexidine gluconate-based mouthwash in combination with careful oral hygiene may cure gingivitis, although they cannot reverse any attachment loss due to periodontitis.
*Regular dental check-ups and professional teeth cleaning as required: Dental check-ups serve to monitor the person&#x27;s oral hygiene methods and levels of attachment around teeth, identify any early signs of periodontitis, and monitor response to treatment.

Typically, dental hygienists (or dentists) use special instruments to clean (debride) teeth below the gumline and disrupt any plaque growing below the gumline. This is a standard treatment to prevent any further progress of established periodontitis. Studies show that after such a professional cleaning (periodontal debridement), microbial plaque tends to grow back to precleaning levels after about three to four months. Nonetheless, the continued stabilization of a person&#x27;s periodontal state depends largely, if not primarily, on the person&#x27;s oral hygiene at home, as well as on the go. Without daily oral hygiene, periodontal disease will not be overcome, especially if the person has a history of extensive periodontal disease.

==Management==
The cornerstone of successful periodontal treatment starts with establishing excellent oral hygiene. This includes twice-daily brushing with daily flossing. Also, the use of an interdental brush is helpful if space between the teeth allows. For smaller spaces, products such as narrow picks with soft rubber bristles provide excellent manual cleaning. Persons with dexterity problems, such as with arthritis, may find oral hygiene to be difficult and may require more frequent professional care and/or the use of a powered toothbrush. Persons with periodontitis must realize it is a chronic inflammatory disease and a lifelong regimen of excellent hygiene and professional maintenance care with a dentist/hygienist or periodontist is required to maintain affected teeth.

===Initial therapy===
Removal of microbial plaque and calculus is necessary to establish periodontal health. The first step in the treatment of periodontitis involves nonsurgical cleaning below the gum line with a procedure called &quot;root surface instrumentation&quot; or &quot;RSI&quot;, this causes a mechanical disturbance to the bacterial biofilm below the gumline. This procedure involves the use of specialized curettes to mechanically remove plaque and calculus from below the gumline, and may require multiple visits and local anesthesia to adequately complete. In addition to initial RSI, it may also be necessary to adjust the occlusion (bite) to prevent excessive force on teeth that have reduced bone support. Also, it may be necessary to complete any other dental needs, such as replacement of rough, plaque-retentive restorations, closure of open contacts between teeth, and any other requirements diagnosed at the initial evaluation. It is important to note that RSI is different to scaling and root planing: RSI only removes the calculus, while scaling and root planing removes the calculus as well as underlying softened dentine, which leaves behind a smooth and glassy surface, which is not a requisite for periodontal healing. Therefore, RSI is now advocated over root planing.

===Reevaluation===
Nonsurgical scaling and root planing are usually successful if the periodontal pockets are shallower than . The dentist or hygienist must perform a re-evaluation four to six weeks after the initial scaling and root planing, to determine if the person&#x27;s oral hygiene has improved and inflammation has regressed. Probing should be avoided then, and an analysis by gingival index should determine the presence or absence of inflammation. The monthly reevaluation of periodontal therapy should involve periodontal charting as a better indication of the success of treatment, and to see if other courses of treatment can be identified. Pocket depths of greater than which remain after initial therapy, with bleeding upon probing, indicate continued active disease and will very likely lead to further bone loss over time. This is especially true in molar tooth sites where furcations (areas between the roots) have been exposed.

===Surgery===
If nonsurgical therapy is found to have been unsuccessful in managing signs of disease activity, periodontal surgery may be needed to stop progressive bone loss and regenerate lost bone where possible. Many surgical approaches are used in the treatment of advanced periodontitis, including open flap debridement and osseous surgery, as well as guided tissue regeneration and bone grafting. The goal of periodontal surgery is access for definitive calculus removal and surgical management of bony irregularities which have resulted from the disease process to reduce pockets as much as possible. Long-term studies have shown, in moderate to advanced periodontitis, surgically treated cases often have less further breakdown over time and, when coupled with a regular post-treatment maintenance regimen, are successful in nearly halting tooth loss in nearly 85% of diagnosed people.

===Local drug delivery===
Local drug deliveries in periodontology has gained acceptance and popularity compared to systemic drugs due to decreased risk in development of resistant flora and other side effects. A meta analysis of local tetracycline found improvement. Local application of statin may be useful.

===Systemic drug delivery===
Systemic drug delivery in conjunction with non-surgical therapy may be used as a means to reduce the percentage of the bacterial plaque load in the mouth. Many different antibiotics and also combinations of them have been tested; however, there is yet very low-certainty evidence of any significant difference in the short and long term compared to non-surgical therapy alone. It may be beneficial to limit the use of systemic drugs, since bacteria can develop antimicrobial resistance and some specific antibiotics might induce temporary mild adverse effects, such as nausea, diarrhoea and gastrointestinal disturbances.

=== Adjunctive systemic antimicrobial treatment ===
There is currently low-quality evidence suggesting if adjunctive systemic antimicrobials are beneficial for the non-surgical treatment of periodontitis. It is not sure whether some antibiotics are better than others when used alongside scaling and root planing).

===Maintenance===
Once successful periodontal treatment has been completed, with or without surgery, an ongoing regimen of &quot;periodontal maintenance&quot; is required. This involves regular checkups and detailed cleanings every three months to prevent repopulation of periodontitis-causing microorganisms, and to closely monitor affected teeth so early treatment can be rendered if the disease recurs. Usually, periodontal disease exists due to poor plaque control resulting from inappropriate brushing. Therefore, if the brushing techniques are not modified, a periodontal recurrence is probable.

=== Other ===
Most alternative &quot;at-home&quot; gum disease treatments involve injecting antimicrobial solutions, such as hydrogen peroxide, into periodontal pockets via slender applicators or oral irrigators. This process disrupts anaerobic micro-organism colonies and is effective at reducing infections and inflammation when used daily. A number of other products, functionally equivalent to hydrogen peroxide, are commercially available, but at substantially higher cost. However, such treatments do not address calculus formations, and so are short-lived, as anaerobic microbial colonies quickly regenerate in and around calculus.

Doxycycline may be given alongside the primary therapy of scaling (see § initial therapy). Doxycycline has been shown to improve indicators of disease progression (namely probing depth and attachment level). Its mechanism of action involves inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (such as collagenase), which degrade the teeth&#x27;s supporting tissues (periodontium) under inflammatory conditions. To avoid killing beneficial oral microbes, only small doses of doxycycline (20 mg) are used.

Phage therapy may be a new therapeutic alternative.

==Prognosis==
If people have 7-mm or deeper pockets around their teeth, as measured by a periodontal probe, then they would likely risk eventual tooth loss over the years. If this periodontal condition is not identified and people remain unaware of the progressive nature of the disease, then years later, they may be surprised that some teeth will gradually become loose and may need to be extracted, sometimes due to a severe infection or even pain.

According to the Sri Lankan tea laborer study, in the absence of any oral hygiene activity, approximately 10% will experience severe periodontal disease with rapid loss of attachment (&gt;2 mm/year). About 80% will experience moderate loss (1–2 mm/year) and the remaining 10% will not experience any loss.

== Epidemiology ==
Periodontitis is very common, and is widely regarded as the second most common dental disease worldwide, after dental decay, and in the United States has a prevalence of 30–50% of the population, but only about 10% have severe forms.

Chronic periodontitis affects about 750 million people or about 10.8% of the world population as of 2010.

Like other conditions intimately related to access to hygiene and basic medical monitoring and care, periodontitis tends to be more common in economically disadvantaged populations or regions. Its occurrence decreases with a higher standard of living. In Israeli populations, individuals of Yemenite, North-African, South Asian, or Mediterranean origin have higher prevalence of periodontal disease than individuals from European descent. Periodontitis is frequently reported to be socially patterned, i.e. people from the lower end of the socioeconomic scale are affected more often than people from the upper end of the socioeconomic scale.

==History==
An ancient hominid from 3 million years ago had gum disease. Records from China and the Middle East, along with archaeological studies, show that mankind has had periodontal disease for at least many thousands of years. In Europe and the Middle East archaeological research looking at ancient plaque DNA, shows that in the ancient hunter-gatherer lifestyle there was less gum disease, but that it became more common when more cereals were eaten. The Otzi Iceman was shown to have had severe gum disease. Furthermore, research has shown that in the Roman era in the UK, there was less periodontal disease than in modern times. The researchers suggest that smoking may be a key to this.

==Society and culture==

=== Etymology ===
The word &quot;periodontitis&quot; (Greek: ) comes from the Greek &quot;peri&quot;, &quot;around&quot;, ( ), &quot;tooth&quot;, and the suffix , in medical terminology &quot;inflammation&quot;. The word &quot;pyorrhea&quot; (alternative spelling: &quot;pyorrhoea&quot;) comes from the Greek (), &quot;discharge of matter&quot;, itself from , &quot;discharge from a sore&quot;, &quot;rhoē&quot;, &quot;flow&quot;, and the suffix -&quot;ia&quot;. In English this term can describe, as in Greek, any discharge of pus; i.e. it is not restricted to these diseases of the teeth.

===Economics===
It is estimated that lost productivity due to severe periodontitis costs the global economy about US$54 billion each year.

==Other animals==
Periodontal disease is the most common disease found in dogs and affects more than 80% of dogs aged three years or older. Its prevalence in dogs increases with age, but decreases with increasing body weight; i.e., toy and miniature breeds are more severely affected. Recent research undertaken at the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition has established that the bacteria associated with gum disease in dogs are not the same as in humans. Systemic disease may develop because the gums are very vascular (have a good blood supply). The blood stream carries these anaerobic micro-organisms, and they are filtered out by the kidneys and liver, where they may colonize and create microabscesses. The microorganisms traveling through the blood may also attach to the heart valves, causing vegetative infective endocarditis (infected heart valves). Additional diseases that may result from periodontitis include chronic bronchitis and pulmonary fibrosis.
