<text>Smithville is a city in Bastrop County, Texas, United States, near the Colorado River. The population was 3,922 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Thomas Jefferson Gazley arrived in 1827 and set the pace of development for Smithville by building the first house and establishing the first store, which served incoming settlers. He later served in the Mexican government and helped write the Texas Declaration of Independence and the first Constitution, and became a true Texas hero.

William Smith&#x27;s family arrived several years after Gazley. They also owned a store and were early influences on the area, including the naming of Smithville where about seventeen families lived on the south bank of the Colorado River.

Local businessman, Murray Burleson, persuaded the approaching railroad to erect a terminus here and the TB&amp;H steamed through in 1887. The Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas took over the Taylor, Bastrop, and Houston Railroad in 1891. In 1894, the MK&amp;T established central shops in Smithville, giving rise to growth which resulted in Smithville becoming the largest town in Bastrop County for nearly fifty years.

This population created markets for homes, stores, and other necessities as it grew from a frontier village to a town. The Hill family moved retail marketing here and established the first bank. The need for infrastructure systems attracted the Buescher brothers to come and create the first utilities. Partnerships of prominent men involved in land-based activities united the Bueschers, Powells, Cooks, Eaglestons, Turneys, Rabbs, Buntes and others to establish cotton gins, general stores, drugstores, lumber and brickyards and to develop numerous churches and fraternal organizations such as the Masons and the Oddfellows and to provide medical care for this now flourishing community.

In 1895, this thriving town was officially incorporated into the City of Smithville.

==History==

Seymour was founded by settlers from Oregon, who called the town Oregon City; it was originally located where the Western Trail crossed the Brazos River, which flows just south of the townsite. A post office was established in 1879, when the town&#x27;s name was changed to honor local cowboy Seymour Munday, after whom nearby Munday was also named. The census of 1880 shows 78 people living in the 901-square-mile county. The first settlers were ranchers. During those years, the Miller brothers established a large ranch with the headquarters some 10 miles south of Seymour on Miller Creek. About 50 men were in the Miller outfit, and some of these were reportedly outlaws. Not unusually, some of the cowboys rode into town and proceeded to &quot;shoot it up&quot;. The Millers realized that law had come to Baylor County in 1884, and sold the ranch. It was the largest transaction ever made in northwest Texas at that time. The purchasers used the Hashknife Ranch brand, which is still in use in the county.

Commerce, a newspaper, a hotel, and the county courthouse all followed soon after, as did violence between cowboys and settlers. The town experienced two distinct economic booms; the first, short-lived, was with the construction of the Wichita Valley rail line in 1880, and the second was due to the discovery of oil in 1906. The population grew from 500 in 1884 to almost 3800 in 1950; it remained around that level for more than 30 years, but has declined since to 2,575 in the 2020 census. Agribusiness, as well as some tourism from nearby Lake Kemp, has overtaken oil as the driving factor of the local economy. The Old Settlers Reunion and Rodeo has been held each July since 1896.

The town calls itself &quot;the crossroads of North Texas&quot; because it is located at the junction of five highways: U.S. highways 82, 277, 183, and 283, and State Highway 114.

On August 12, 1936, the temperature at Seymour reached , the highest temperature ever recorded in Texas.

<text>Beeville is a city in Bee County, Texas, United States. Its population of 13,543 at the 2020 census makes it the 207th-largest city in Texas. It is the county seat of Bee County and home to the main campus of Coastal Bend College. The area around the city contains three prisons operated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.

Many of the stately homes, commercial buildings, and schools in the area, including the Bee County Courthouse, were designed by architect William Charles Stephenson, who came to Beeville in 1908 from Buffalo, New York. Beeville is a national Main Street city. Gutzon Borglum, the sculptor of Mount Rushmore, and his son Lincoln, lived in the city during the time Rushmore was being sculpted.

==History and culture==
The original and official site on the Poesta River was first settled by the Burke, Carroll, and Heffernan families in the 1830s. Present-day Beeville was established on of land donated by Ann Burke in May 1859, after the Republic of Texas was annexed by the United States. It was first named &quot;Maryville&quot; for pioneer Mary Heffernan.

It was renamed Beeville after Barnard E. Bee, Sr., who had served as secretary of state and secretary of war for the Republic of Texas. It was called Beeville-on-the-Poesta, with a nearby community called Beeville-on-the-Medio 7 mi (11 km) to the west. The first post office opened in 1859.

In 1886, the first railroad was constructed through Beeville, stimulating the growth of the economy and population. The Southern Pacific Transportation Company operated these railroads until the early 1970s.

In September 1942, Alfred Irving, who is believed to be one of the final chattel slaves in the United States, was freed at a farm near Beeville. Alex L. Skrobarcek and his daughter, Susie, were indicted by a federal grand jury in Laredo, Texas on November 9, 1942. The pair were found guilty in Federal court in Corpus Christi, Texas on Thursday, March 18, 1943. Alex L. Skrobarcek was sentenced to only four years in prison, while his daughter, Susie Skrobarcek, received two years.

The United States Navy operated the Beeville Naval Air Station, which trained Navy airplane pilots during World War II from 1943 through 1946. The base was reopened in 1952 as Naval Air Station Chase Field, continuing in operation until 1992.

Beeville was served by Trans-Texas Airways during the 1950s; it operated scheduled passenger flights with Douglas DC-3 propeller airliners from Chase Field with service to Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Harlingen, Houston, San Antonio, and other destinations in Texas.

In 1967, the town was inundated by of rain during Hurricane Beulah.

Joseph T. Hallinan, the author of the 2001 book &quot;Going Up the River: Travels in a Prison Nation&quot;, described Beeville as a prison town. At the time, Beeville was trying to attract more prison business since the employment is stable. Hallinan wrote that Beeville was attempting to be &quot;a prison hub, becoming roughly what Pittsburgh is to steel or Detroit is to cars&quot;.

<text>Belton is a city in the U.S. state of Texas. Belton is the county seat of Bell County and is the fifth largest city in the Killeen-Temple metropolitan area. In 2020, the population of Belton was 23,054, and the metro region had a population of 450,051 according to US Census estimates.

==History==
Belton and Bell County have been the site of human habitation since at least 6000 BCE. Evidence of early inhabitants, including campsites, kitchen middens and burial mounds from the late prehistoric era have been discovered in the Stillhouse Hollow Lake and Belton Lake areas. The earliest identifiable inhabitants were the Tonkawa, who traditionally followed buffalo by foot. Belton was also home to the Lipan Apache, Wacos, Nadaco, Kiowas and Comanche. By the 1840s most tribes had been pushed out by settlements, but skirmishes with the Comanche existed until the early 1870s.

Belton was first settled 1850 and named Nolanville, taking the name of nearby Nolan Springs which were named after the Texan explorer Philip Nolan. In 1851, it changed its name to Belton after being named the county seat of newly created Bell County named after Peter Hansborough Bell, the Governor of Texas at that time. In 1860, the population was 300, the largest in the county. During the run up to the civil war, Belton had a large pro-Union minority. A Whig Party paper and anti-secession paper called &quot;The Independent&quot; was published there and the city voted overwhelmingly for Sam Houston for governor, who was strongly against Texas secession. Nonetheless, in 1861 Bell County voted for secession and many residents fought in the Confederate Army. After the civil war, Belton experienced unrest. Several pro-union sympathizers were lynched in 1866 and Federal troops were called in to protect the Federal Judge serving in the city. After Reconstruction, the city, close to a major feeder of the Chisholm Trail, served as growing business center for the region.

In 1868, Martha McWhirter, a prominent figure in Belton&#x27;s non-sectarian Union Sunday School, created the Woman&#x27;s Commonwealth, the only Texas women&#x27;s commune of the 1800s. The
commune started several business ventures including a successful hotel. In 1899, the group sold their holdings and relocated to Maryland. The town experienced rapid growth in the 1880s with the building of the courthouse, Baylor Female College buildings, and a &quot;railroad war&quot; in 
which, by 1881, Belton was bypassed by the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad, which built Temple, 8 miles to the east, as the local junction and depot town. In 1904, the town reported 
a population of 3,700. The town began to thrive and reached a population of 6,500 in 1928. However the town was decimated by the Great Depression and was down to a population of 3,779 only three years later in 1931.

The town began to recover in the run up to World War II as Fort Hood was opened nearby in 1942, housing the tank destroyer Tactical and Firing Center. 
Encompassing over 200,000 acres and almost 90,000 troops, this brought a large population and a lot of economic activity to the area. By 1950, the city&#x27;s population was back up to 6,246 and by 1990 had reached 12,476.

<text>Harker Heights is a city in Bell County, Texas, United States. As of the 2020 census, 33,097 people resided in the city, up from a population of 17,308 in 2000. This makes Harker Heights the third-largest city in Bell County, after Killeen and Temple. Incorporated in 1960, the city derives its name from one of the two original landowners and founder, Harley Kern. Harker Heights is part of the Killeen–Temple–Fort Hood metropolitan area.

==History==
Harker Heights is located near Fort Cavazos, a major United States Army post that was designated a permanent military facility in 1950. As the post expanded, the surrounding civilian population increased. Water Control and Improvement District No. 4 was established on land near the Killeen city limits and the military post in 1955, and included the land owned by Pinckney R. Cox and Harley Kern, two hog farmers. These two men subdivided their land in 1957 and began selling lots. By 1960, between 600 and 700 of the lots had been developed and new residents supplied with water and other utility services. Following a petition for an incorporation election, the city was established on September 24, 1960, and Cox was elected mayor. Kern had died before the incorporation, and the Harker in Harker Heights was a concatenation of Harley Kern&#x27;s name as a tribute to one of the original landowners. The town&#x27;s boundaries expanded to include Forest Hills, Highland Oaks, and Comanche Hills. Cox, Sam Garth Jr., and Barney Sissom created GIASISCO Corporation, which was meant to help expand the town from .

<text>Holland is a city in Bell County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,075 at the 2020 census. The center of population of Texas is located in Holland. It is part of the Killeen–Temple–Fort Hood metropolitan statistical area. (Fort Hood was recently renamed Fort Cavazos.)

==History==
Holland&#x27;s history reaches back to a time before the Civil War, when a community known as Mountain Home began to grow up near Gotcher&#x27;s Mountain, a hill south of town. A post office was established on August 22, 1870, under the name Mountain Home, with James Shaw as postmaster. On November 6, 1871, the Mountain Home post office was officially closed.

In 1881, an extension of the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad was laid out from Denison to Taylor, and the tracks were constructed through Bell County in 1881 and 1882, from north to south, passing through the Holland community. This brought about the town of Holland as it is known today.

James Reuben Holland arrived in Belton, Texas, on October 26, 1874, with a wagon and horses, his wife and four children, and six dollars cash. A. Moss made an application for the Mountain Home community to have a new post office again, but by that time, the name &quot;Mountain Home&quot; had already been claimed by another community. Without Holland&#x27;s knowledge, Moss submitted the name &quot;Holland&quot;. The Holland post office was officially approved April 10, 1879, with the appointment of Alfred Evans as postmaster. In 1877, Holland bought of land along Darr&#x27;s Creek for $5.00 an acre. The following year, Holland bought an additional and built a steam-powered cotton gin.

<text>Killeen is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, located in Bell County. According to the 2020 census, its population was 153,095, making it the 19th-most populous city in Texas and the largest of the three principal cities of Bell County. It is the principal city of the Killeen–Temple–Fort Cavazos Metropolitan Statistical Area. Killeen is north of Austin, southwest of Dallas, and northeast of San Antonio.

Killeen is directly adjacent to the main cantonment of Fort Cavazos. Its economy depends on the activities of the post, and the soldiers and their families stationed there. It is known as a military &quot;boom town&quot; because of its rapid growth and high influx of soldiers.

==History ==

In 1881, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway extended its tracks through central Texas, buying a few miles southwest of a small farming community known as Palo Alto, which had existed since about 1872. The railroad platted a 70-block town on its land and named it after Frank P. Killeen, the assistant general manager of the railroad. By the next year, the town included a railroad depot, a saloon, several stores, and a school. Many of the residents of the surrounding smaller communities in the area moved to Killeen. By 1884, the town had grown to include about 350 people, served by five general stores, two gristmills, two cotton gins, two saloons, a lumberyard, a blacksmith shop, and a hotel.

Killeen expanded as it became an important shipping point for cotton, wool, and grain in western Bell and eastern Coryell Counties. By 1900, its population was about 780.

Around 1905, local politicians and businessmen convinced the Texas legislature to build bridges over Cowhouse Creek and other streams, doubling Killeen&#x27;s trade area. A public water system began operation in 1914 and its population had increased to 1,300 residents.

Until the 1940s, Killeen remained a relatively small and isolated farm trade center. The buildup associated with World War II changed that dramatically. In 1942, Camp Hood (recommissioned as Fort Hood in 1950) was created as a military training post to meet war demands. Laborers, construction workers, contractors, soldiers, and their families moved into the area by the thousands, and Killeen became a military boomtown. The opening of Camp Hood radically altered the nature of the local economy, since the sprawling new military post covered almost half of Killeen&#x27;s farming trade area.

The loss of more than 300 farms and ranches led to the demise of Killeen&#x27;s cotton gins and other farm-related businesses. New businesses were started to provide services for the military camp. Killeen then suffered a recession when Camp Hood was all but abandoned after the end of the Second World War, but when Southern congressmen got it established in 1950 as a permanent army post, the city boomed again. Its population increased from about 1,300 in 1949 to 7,045 in 1950, and between 1950 and 1951, about 100 new commercial buildings were constructed in Killeen.

In addition to shaping local economic development after 1950, the military presence at Fort Hood also changed the city&#x27;s racial, religious, and ethnic composition. No blacks lived in the city in 1950, for example. By the early 1950s, Marlboro Heights, an all-black subdivision, had been developed. In 1956, the city school board voted to integrate the local high school. The city&#x27;s first resident Catholic priest was assigned to the St. Joseph&#x27;s parish in 1954, and around the same time, new Presbyterian and Episcopal churches were built.

By 1955, Killeen had an estimated 21,076 residents and 224 businesses. Troop cutbacks and transfers in the mid-1950s led to another recession in Killeen, which lasted until 1959, when various divisions were reassigned to Fort Hood. The town continued to grow through the 1960s, especially after US involvement deepened in the Vietnam War and demand for troops kept rising.

By 1970, Killeen had developed into a city of 35,507 inhabitants and had added a municipal airport, a new municipal library, and a junior college (Central Texas College). By 1980, when the census counted 49,307 people in Killeen, it was the largest city in Bell County.

After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in the late summer of 1990, the city prepared for war, sending thousands of troops from the 2nd Armored Division and the 1st Cavalry Division to the Middle East.

On October 16, 1991, George Hennard murdered 23 people and then committed suicide at the Luby&#x27;s Cafeteria in Killeen.

In December 1991, one of Killeen&#x27;s high school football teams, the Killeen Kangaroos, won the 5-A Division I state football championship by defeating Sugar Land Dulles 14–10 in the Astrodome.

<text>Nolanville is a city in Bell County, Texas, United States. The population was 5,917 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Killeen–Temple–Fort Cavazos Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Nolanville reached its peak as a town between 1890 and 1900, when it went into a holding pattern. A weekly newspaper, the &quot;Item&quot;, was started by 1896. The first telephone service in Nolanville was started, using barbed wire for lines. Two lines were used, a south and a north, with Nolan Creek serving as the dividing line. Nolanville School, one of the larger rural schools in the county in the early 20th century, had 90 pupils in 1903. The first automobile appeared between 1900 and 1910. The automobile caused Nolanville businesses to decline because it made the trip to Belton or Killeen so much easier.

In 1921, a new two-story brick school was built, and in 1938, the original part of the present school plant was built. By the mid-1940s, the community had 150 to 200 residents, but began to decline after the end of World War II. After dropping to 50 inhabitants in the 1950s, the town began to revive in the 1960s and had 200 residents and six businesses when it incorporated on March 27, 1961. By the late 1960s Nolanville was caught up in the expansion of the Killeen-Fort Cavazos area, and, as a suburban community, its population rose to 740 in 1968. Nolanville was featured in a 1970s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; episode, which exposed creative law enforcement practices.

Nolanville Common School District #50 ceased to exist in the spring of 1972, when it was annexed to the Killeen Independent School District by the Bell County Board of School Trustees. This action was requested by the Nolanville Board of School Trustees. The Nolanville Common School District was one of only three remaining common school districts in Bell County at that time. It was also uncommon for a school to consolidate because its enrollment and academic needs were greater than its capacity rather than because enrollment had dropped.

By 1974, Nolanville&#x27;s population was 1,050. It had grown to 1,834 in 1990 and 2,150 in 2000, then jumped to 4,259 as of the 2010 census.

The city became home rule in the 2011 election. The city motto is &quot;A Great Place to Live.&quot; Demographics suggest a high number of youth live in the city. Nolanville is a common starting point for endurance bicycling and running. Special events include the Annual Fox Trot 5K and Train Whistle Jamboree.

==Geography==

<text>Salado ( ) is a village in Bell County, Texas, United States. Salado was first incorporated in 1867 for the sole purpose of building a bridge across Salado Creek. In 2000, the citizens of Salado voted in favor of reincorporation, before which it was a census-designated place. The population was 2,394 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Archaeological evidence of a paleolithic Native American settlement dating back about 15,500 years, the Buttermilk Creek Complex, has been unearthed in Salado.

The first record of white settlers in the area occurred in 1834, but by 1836, the pioneer settlers abandoned the area due to frequent Indian attacks and the invasion by General Santa Anna and the Mexican Army. The first permanent Anglo-American settler at Salado was Archibald Willingham in 1850. In 1852, the Salado Post Office was established. In 1859, the Salado College Joint Stock Company was created by Col. Elijah Sterling Clack Robertson, who donated 320 acres north and south of the springs to be broken into lots and form the village of Salado, with the proceeds of the sale going to form Salado College. The college operated from 1860 to 1885 and 1895 to 1913; the former college building was occupied by the Thomas Arnold High School.

From 1866 to 1885, the famous Chisholm Trail cattle drives passed through this area, with the Stagecoach Inn being one of the stops. In 1867, Salado incorporated to build a bridge across Salado Creek. By 1884, Salado had a population of 900, seven churches, 14 stores, two hotels, two blacksmiths, and three cotton gins. However, after the railroads bypassed Salado to the north and south, trade moved away from the town and the population began to dwindle, hitting 400 by 1914 and down to 200 by 1950.

The town is home to the Stagecoach Inn, the oldest continuously running hotel in Texas.

Nineteen Salado locations are listed in the National Register of Historic Places, including the George Washington Baines House.

<text>Temple is a city in Bell County, Texas, United States. As of 2020, the city has a population of 82,073 according to the U.S. census. Temple lies in the region referred to as Central Texas and is a principal city in the Killeen–Temple–Fort Hood metropolitan area, (Fort Hood was redesignated &quot;Fort Cavazos&quot; in 2023) which as of the 2020 Census had a population of 475,367. Located off Interstate 35, Temple is 65 miles north of Austin, 34 miles south of Waco and 27 miles east of Killeen.

==History==

Temple was founded as a railroad town by the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad (GC&amp;SF). The settlement began in 1880 as a GC&amp;SF construction camp called Temple Junction by the railway and known as &quot;Tanglefoot&quot; or &quot;Mud Town&quot; to residents. In January 1881, a post office was established, and the settlement was officially named Temple, after Bernard Moore Temple, the chief civil engineer of the GC&amp;SF. The town was incorporated in 1882.

Also in 1882, the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway built through the town, and soon after, the GC&amp;SF made Temple a division point. In its early years, Temple was a town of shacks and tents with a large number of saloons and tough characters found in the early West. Locally, it was nicknamed &quot;Tanglefoot&quot; because some residents found that the combination of muddy streets and liquor made walking through the town challenging.

Very shortly after the town was incorporated in 1882, two private schools were founded in the city: the Temple Academy was organized and a public school was established in 1884. In 1893, the annual Temple Stag Party began, growing out of a private Thanksgiving celebration attended by some of the town&#x27;s leading men. It was held until 1923. 

The city became home to numerous medical clinics and the Santa Fe Hospital and Scott and White Memorial Hospital; the two hospitals merged in 1983 and now form the Baylor Scott &amp; White Medical Center – Temple. Temple&#x27;s position as the largest city in Bell County was earned largely on account of its medical facilities and its importance as a major railroad junction.

In 1886, the GC&amp;SF was purchased by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, popularly known as the Santa Fe Railroad or simply the Santa Fe. The Santa Fe&#x27;s Temple depot was the site of the largest Harvey House restaurant in Texas, and the Harvey House organization also operated a dairy and vegetable farm near the city. Harvey Houses provided meals for Santa Fe passengers during stopovers and were also popular with local customers. The chain was famous for its high-quality food and its iconic uniformed all-female &quot;Harvey Girl&quot; waitstaff. 

The Temple Railroad and Heritage Museum, on the second floor of the Santa Fe Railroad depot at 315 West Avenue B, commemorates the significance of railroads for the city and includes a large collection of Harvey House memorabilia.

==Geography==
Temple is located northeast of the center of Bell County. It is the second-largest city in Bell County. It is bordered to the southwest, on the opposite side of the Leon River, by Belton, the county seat.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
The Hill Country Transit District (The HOP) operates three bus routes within the city, with an additional bus connection to Killeen.

Temple was founded as a railroad junction and serves as a major freight railroad hub to this day. Both the Union Pacific Railroad and BNSF Railway have mainlines serving the city, and a BNSF rail yard and locomotive maintenance facility are located here. Amtrak serves the city with its &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; passenger train, which stops at the Temple Railway Station.

Temple has general aviation services via Draughon-Miller Central Texas Regional Airport. While commercial airline service is not currently available in the city, Temple is served by these nearby airports:

* Killeen Regional Airport in Killeen (32 miles west)
* Waco Regional Airport in Waco (44 miles north)
* Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Austin (74 miles south)

====High-speed rail====
In 2009, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) proposed the Texas T-Bone High Speed Rail Corridor that would create a high-speed rail line from Dallas-Fort Worth to San Antonio and another line from Houston that would connect with the first line. While the location for the connection of the two lines had not been officially established, the mayor at the time, Bill Jones III, made an effort to ensure that connection happened in Temple. Temple would be a stop along the line, regardless of where that connection between the two lines would be. The next year in 2010, TxDOT received a federal grant to conduct a study for a line connecting Oklahoma City with San Antonio, and Temple was in the pathway of that line. In 2013, a consultant for the Texas High Speed Rail Corporation stated that the only two connections being considered for the two lines were a connection in Temple and a connection in San Antonio; they expected to make that decision by the end of 2014. The organization also indicated that they plan to have the high-speed rail in operation by 2025. If that connection occurred in Temple, the Killeen – Temple – Fort Hood metropolitan area, with a population of 420,375, would be within about 45 minutes of Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio.

===Health care===
Temple is known as a regional medical center, with four major hospitals: Baylor Scott &amp; White Medical Center, Baylor Scott &amp; White McLane Children&#x27;s Medical Center, Olin E.

<text>Converse is a city in Bexar County, Texas, United States, northeast of downtown San Antonio. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 27,466. It is part of the San Antonio metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Converse is on Farm to Market Road 1976, thirteen miles northeast of downtown San Antonio in northeastern Bexar County. It was named for the chief engineer of the Southern Pacific Railroad, a Major Converse, who in 1877 bought a tract of land including the townsite. A post office was established in 1878, and by 1885 a population of thirty was reported. In 1896 the town had a saloon, two cotton gins, and a grocery. In 1990, the community, originally settled by German farmers, reportedly had the oldest 4-H Club in Texas. A singing society, the Salatrillo Liederkranz, had been active for many years. The population in 1946 was 175; by 1965 the town had twenty-two businesses and 900 residents. Over time, Converse has become a suburb of San Antonio. In the 1980s, an influx of middle-class African Americans most of them first-time homeowners were attracted to developing communities northeast of San Antonio. Today, Converse is a prime example of wealthy, Black suburbs in the U.S. In 1990, the community had a population of 8,887, and in 1991 it had seventy-three businesses. In 2000 the population had grown to 11,508 with 390 businesses.

In 2017, Converse proposed the annexation of 12 mi2 of territory near Randolph Air Force Base in northeastern Bexar County. Several large commercial areas are included in the annexation. The additional land would be taken in a series of phased expansions until 2033. Once completed, the area of Converse would triple in size. Municipal services would become available to an often neglected part of the county. The San Antonio City Council has unanimously approved the annexation; now the measure goes before the Converse City Council and the county commissioners.

<text>Helotes ( ) is a city in Bexar County, Texas, United States, located on the far northwestern side of San Antonio. It is part of the San Antonio-New Braunfels metropolitan statistical area. Its population was 9,030 at the 2020 census.

==History==

According to anthropologists, the area was occupied seasonally from about 5,000 BCE by small bands of nomadic Native American tribes in search of food and game. The Lipan Apache moved into the area in the late 17th century and occupied it throughout the 18th century. However, the Lipan were forced from the area in the early 1820s by the Comanche Indians.

A small farming and ranching community began to develop in the area shortly after the Texas Revolution in the late 1830s. The ranches suffered occasional attacks by the Comanches until the late 1870s. The last Indian raid in Helotes may have been in 1878, when a postmaster, Carl Mueller, was killed by Indians. 

In 1858, a Scottish immigrant, Dr. George Marnoch, purchased the land that later became the site of the town. Marnoch&#x27;s home at one time served as a stagecoach stop and a post office for cowboys driving their cattle from Bandera to auction in San Antonio. His heirs sold a portion of their property in 1880 to a Swiss immigrant, Arnold Gugger, who built a home and mercantile store around which the town of Helotes arose. In 1908, Gugger sold his property to Bert Hileman, who opened the town&#x27;s first dance hall. He was also instrumental in getting old Bandera Road paved and opening the town&#x27;s first filling station. He sold his property in downtown Helotes in 1919, when the town&#x27;s population declined.

In 1946, the manager of San Antonio&#x27;s Majestic Theatre, John T. Floore, opened the landmark John T. Floore Country Store, which is actually a dance hall (or &quot;honky tonk&quot;) that draws top country music talent, including Willie Nelson, who still plays the venue on occasion. Floore also financed the first annual Helotes Cornyval festival in the 1960s, which was held to celebrate the opening of a new post office.

Corn played an important role in the heritage of Helotes. The local Native Americans planted corn (maize outside the US) in the fertile valleys of the area, and feed corn was a major crop grown in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The town name is derived from the Spanish word &quot;elote&quot;, which can mean &quot;ear of maize&quot;, &quot;corncob&quot;, or simply &quot;corn&quot;, but exactly how the town came to be called Helotes is still a subject of debate.

As the urban sprawl of San Antonio expanded and approached the outskirts of Helotes in the 1970s. After a decade of planning and negotiation, Helotes became an incorporated city in October 1981. To this day, residents struggle with the dilemma of maintaining the city&#x27;s rugged country charm, while at the same time allowing for the development of modern suburban facilities and businesses. Helotes was the hometown of late Texas State Senator Frank L. Madla, who died after his home on the south side of San Antonio caught fire on November 24, 2006.

===1953 tornado===
On April 28, 1953, the town was hit by a violent wide F4 tornado struck the city, damaging or destroying multiple structures. Two people were killed and 15 others were injured.

== History ==

The Town of Hollywood Park was officially incorporated on December 7, 1955, after residents were concerned about losing the neighborhood&#x27;s autonomy to San Antonio. The community has a distinctly rural feel and residents often build homes they intend to live in for the rest of their lives. Many of the community&#x27;s leaders of today are the children and grandchildren of some of the original residents.

The Police Department was established in 1955 soon after the town was incorporated. John Nelson was hired as its first Police Chief. The police car was a Ford Fairlane 500. Shortly thereafter, a few volunteer part-time policemen joined the force. When the town was formed, water hoses had to stay connected at each residence and ready to use in case of a fire. In 1958, a group of men joined and a couple of volunteers attended the Firefighters School at Texas A&amp;M University, and the Hollywood Park Volunteer Fire Department was founded. That year all the firemen had was a small pump unit. Robert Oakes, as general chairman, and many volunteers organized the first Hollywood Park Volunteer Fire Department Benefit Barbeque held June 22, 1968, at Raymond Russell Park. Volunteers prepared all the food. 746 people went through the serving line. The event was held for many years at Raymond Russell Park with games for the entire family and a live band. Funds were raised for equipment and to purchase 20 new two-way portable alerting units. Fred T. Keepers, Jr. was Fire Chief from 1967 to 1978. By 1969, eighteen dedicated volunteers provided protection for the 612 residents of Hollywood Park, Hill Country Village, as well as over a large area of ranchlands in the northernmost sections of Bexar County. The City provided the firemen with bright yellow uniforms, but they got no other compensation for their duty. The largest fire occurred in August 1968 when a grass fire erupted near Hwy 281 and burned off 3,000 acres. By 1973, there were 29 volunteers. A new Rescue Unit was purchased through fund raising projects and donations.

In 1971, Mr. Voigt—a rancher who owned the land the town was built on—donated $10,000 to the Town of Hollywood Park to build the Voigt Center, naming Alverne Halloran as custodian, until the town matched funds to begin building. The 3,000 sq. ft. recreation building was finally built in 1974, and the grand opening and dedication was held on October 20, 1974. This was a day of fun and entertainment with games, food and drink offered. The City Council designated this day as &quot;E.E.Voigt Day&quot; in honor of the occasion. Mayor Felix Forshage opened the ceremony. Mr. Voigt introduced his family and spoke of the origin of the park. Tennis courts and a covered picnic area were built in 1975 with an additional $5,000 donation from Mr. Voigt for the tennis courts. A children&#x27;s playground was added later.

In addition to the homes originally built in Hollywood Park, two additional sections were added later to include The Gardens of Hollywood Park and The Enclave of Hollywood Park.

==History==
Kirby was founded as an agricultural community by German immigrants in the early 1900s. Its name derived from the Kirby yard of the Southern Pacific Railroad that crossed through the town. In 1920, the population was around 18 people, made up of mostly farmers. At this time, German was a commonly spoken language.

In the 1950s, the composition of the city shifted from mostly agricultural to military as individuals settled in homes to commute to work at Randolph AFB. The population grew to 600 at this point, and German was less commonly spoken. In 1955, the city was incorporated. A two-year-long drought began in 1957, which ultimately caused many farm failures. Unable to make a profit, the farmers decided to sell their land to the city. Homes and roads were constructed on the purchased land, and the city was further transformed into the suburban area it is today.

===Hobo festival===
Because of the presence of the railroad and the influx of drifters, Kirby received the nickname the &quot;Hobo Capital of Texas.&quot; Officials discovered this fact in 2007 and planned for a &quot;Hobo festival.&quot;

The city held its first annual &quot;hobo festival&quot; during the first weekend of May 2008, including a &quot;hobo parade&quot; through the streets and the crowning of a hobo King and Queen. Through the years, musical acts such as Wade Hayes and Darrell McCall performed at the event. It continued annually until 2019, when officials cancelled it due to some residents&#x27; dislike of the term &quot;hobo&quot;. Other residents have vowed to bring back the festival in the future. The state of the festival has become a political issue in the city.

==Government==
Kirby is characterized as a &quot;home rule&quot; city as permitted under Texas law. The city can govern itself, and mandate ordinances and actions as long as they do not infringe on state or federal law. The government is set up by the 1988 City Charter that calls for a legislative body of six members (city council) and a mayor that heads the legislative body and represents the city. The current mayor is Janeshia Grider. The charter also identifies a city manager to be directed by the council, and accountable for the operation of the city.

==Education==
Residents of Kirby are zoned to Judson Independent School District.

They are zoned to :
* Hopkins Elementary School
* Kirby Middle School
* Karen Wagner High School

===Northern Kirby===
The northern section of the city contains the Kirby Manor and Old Town neighborhoods. It includes Kirby Middle School, Old Seguin Road, FM 78, Gibbs Sprawl Road, and the Southern Pacific railroad tracks. A consistent population of homeless people live under the 410 overpass. 
===Southern Kirby===

The southern section of the city contains Hopkins Elementary School, named after longtime principal Joseph Hopkins. This area of the city is divided between a strictly agricultural sector between Hopkins Elementary and Candlewood Elementary and the homes of the astronaut streets on the other side of Binz Engleman Road. Ackerman is the main road here; it leads to Interstate 10.

===Community sector===

Kirby is characterized as strictly a suburban area of San Antonio. Kirby has its own fire and police departments. The City Hall is located on Bauman Street. This is also where Kirby Municipal Court is located. The Police Department and New Fire Station are located on Ackerman Rd. The city has two parks on both sides of Binz Engleman separated by Ackerman. The western half of the park consists of mostly baseball fields, and the eastern section is accommodated with a full range of recreational activities.

===Natural resources===
Kirby is a major producer of pecans, which grow naturally in the soil. Pecans produce in large quantities between September and November. Certain trees do not produce every four years; 1996, 2000, and 2004 were all years with low pecan production.

Rosillo Creek is the main water stream in Kirby. It once provided the farmers in the agricultural sector with water to irrigate their crops. The creek flows from under the railroad tracks on Gibbs Sprawl Road and further downstream divides Hopkins and Candlewood Elementaries before emptying into Salado Creek in southeastern Bexar County.

==Neighborhoods==
The neighborhoods of Kirby include Kirby Manor, Old Town, Kirby Terrace, and the Springfield Manor (Astronaut Streets).

===Kirby Manor===
Kirby Manor is located within Old Seguin Road to its north, Ackerman Road to its east and Binz Engleman Road to its south. The houses of Kirby Manor were built between the 1950s and 1960s. The citizens are a mix of the native settlers in this area and the newer crowd of young people moving in from other San Antonio suburbs and urban areas to start a life. Kirby Manor&#x27;s proximity to the police station on Ackerman is the main reason why this area has a lower crime rate than the other areas of Kirby.

===Old Town===
Old Town is located between Old Seguin Road and FM 78. Its eastern and western boundaries include Gibbs Sprawl Road and Kirby Middle School, respectively. This is the area where the first homes of Kirby were built. The area is also where Kirby City Hall, the former Kirby Post Office and the old Kirby Fire Department were located. The demographics of this area are increasingly becoming younger, but there is still a large elderly population.

===Springfield Manor===
Springfield Manor (Astronaut Streets) is the westernmost section of Kirby. The area is given this name due to the streets, which are named after famous astronauts. This is the newest section of Kirby and has a large population. To its north is FM 78, to its south is Swann Lane and Gordon Cooper Drive, to its west is Springfield Road and to its east is Ackerman Road.

===Kirby Terrace===
Kirby Terrace is across from Hopkins (formerly Kirby) Elementary, bordered on one side by Ackerman Road.

<text>Somerset is a city in Bexar County, Texas, United States. It is located less than 20 miles south of Downtown San Antonio and is part of the metropolitan area. The population was 1,756 at the 2020 census.

==History==

English speaking European settlers had already arrived in the area by the early 1800s. Somerset was named for an organized settlement that had been begun in 1848, in what is now Atascosa County, by a group of Baptist families from Somerset, Kentucky. The present site was named Somerset when the First Townsite Company was formed on the Artesian Belt Railroad right-of-way on May 25, 1909, by A. M. Pyron, Carl Kurz, and Jonas A. Kerr.

In 1913, while drilling for artesian water, Kurz discovered oil and an economic boom followed. The Somerset oilfield extended from Somerset to below Pleasanton and was the largest known shallow field in the world at that time. Two oil refineries in the field and a pipeline into San Antonio handled the high-gravity crude.

The town grew rapidly from fifty residents in 1925 to 700 in 1928; it was served by a state bank, a ten-room hotel, and several machine and blacksmith shops. A post office opened there in 1920. A nearby lignite coal mine also added to the booming economy of the area.

During the 1920s farmers turned from cotton to dryland fruit and vegetable farming. In 1931, the Somerset Fruit Growers Exchange building was dedicated, and between truck farming, oil, and coal, the town prospered until the mid-1930s, when diminishing oil returns and the Great Depression caused a decline. In 1931 the town reported twenty businesses; by 1958 there were only eight.

In 1920, the Somerset Independent School District was formed from at least five other school districts: Wildman, Senior, Bexar, Old Rock (Old Somerset area), and Oak Island. The Somerset Police Department was created in 1972 followed by the city being incorporated in 1973. Somerset has a mayor-council form of city government.

<doc id="135514" wikidata="Q982843" url="?curid=135514" title="Clifton, Texas">
<text>Clifton is the largest city in Bosque County, Texas, United States. The city&#x27;s population was 3,465 at the 2020 census. Clifton and the surrounding area was settled by Norwegian settlers in the mid 1800s. Today, this areas is in the National Register of historic places as the Norse Historic District. 

==History==
Clifton was founded in the winter of 1852–1853, when the families of Frank Kell, Joseph A. Kemp, Samuel and Monroe Locker, and T. A. McSpadden settled in the vicinity. The town was named Cliff Town after the surrounding limestone cliffs. Over the years, the name was altered to Clifton. The site was originally on the banks of Clear Branch. The Masonic lodge hall and a log schoolhouse were the first public buildings. The post office was established in 1859. The First Presbyterian Church of Clifton was organized in 1861 and is the county&#x27;s oldest church in continuous service. The Baptists built the first church building in Clifton in 1884–1885. After the Civil War, Joel Martin Stinnett, the grandfather of Joseph Kemp, built a flour mill powered by the Bosque River. In 1868, this mill was replaced by a limestone mill, which was converted to the electric power plant that provided the first electricity for Clifton homes and businesses. A three-story school known as Rock School was built &quot;circa&quot; 1870 and served the community for more than twenty years. In 1893, a new building was constructed on property donated to the Clifton school system.

In 1880, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway built a station a mile south of Clifton. Merchants moved their businesses closer to the railroad station, and the town thrived as a business and trade center. The Merchant Exchange and Flour Mill, the first steam flour mill in the Bosque valley, was established in 1887 or 1888. The &quot;Clifton Record&quot;, a newspaper that began publishing in 1895 under the ownership of W. C. O&#x27;Brian, continued to serve the community. Clifton served as the county seat between 1890 and 1892. Clifton Lutheran College, later known as Clifton College, opened in 1896. The community was incorporated in 1901. An earlier attempt at incorporation in 1891 failed when the election results were declared invalid. A fire on December 23, 1906, destroyed a large portion of the business district, which was eventually rebuilt. The Clifton Volunteer Fire Department was organized in 1907. The town&#x27;s need for a hospital was met by Dr. V. D. Goodall and Dr. S. L. Witcher, who formed the Goodall-Witcher Hospital in 1938, which is still operating today, along with the Clifton Clinic. The Lutheran Sunset Home for the elderly was established in Clifton in 1954. In 1991, the Bosque River flooded much of the town due to torrential rains. The town had an estimated population of 204 in 1904 and 3,542 in 2000. It now has a population of 3,442.

On December 21, 1929, a weather station near Clifton recorded 24 inches of snowfall. This is the greatest daily snowfall recorded anywhere in Texas.

On January 15, 2017 an EF1 Tornado struck Clifton damaging at least 25 homes. Although no injuries were reported, the heaviest damage was in town near the intersection of Pecan and Avenue G.

==Culture==
In May 1997, the Texas Legislature officially designated Clifton as the Norwegian Capital of Texas. Clifton and the surrounding area was settled by Norwegian immigrants in the mid-19th century. The nearby community of Norse is the final resting place of Cleng Peerson, commonly recognized as the &quot;Father of Norwegian Immigration to America.&quot; The founder of Norse was Ole Canuteson (Ole Knudsen) from the Stavanger region of Norway.

Visitors to Clifton may explore the vast collection of pioneer Norwegian articles at the Bosque Memorial Museum, or take the Cleng Peerson Memorial Highway west to the Norse Historic District. Sites along the route include many 19th century homes and churches. Among them is Our Savior&#x27;s Lutheran Church, which was established in 1869. The church is the annual site of the Norse Smorgasbord, a feast of traditional foods introduced to the area by Norwegian settlers. Further down the road a Lutefisk dinner is held annually in Cranfills Gap, near the site of the historic St. Olaf Kirke, often called the Old Rock Church.

Clifton celebrates its Norwegian heritage each year with the Norwegian Country Christmas Tour, held the first Saturday of December. The daylong event features demonstrations of Norwegian crafts, tours of homes and buildings harkening back to the days of the early settlers, and many other related activities. The 1999 tour was a featured Road Trip appearing in the November 1999 issue of &quot;Texas Highways&quot;.

The City of Clifton was officially designated a Cultural District by the Texas Commission on the Arts and the State of Texas on Saturday, October 22, 2011. Clifton is home to the Bosque Arts Center. Housed in a restored three-story building that was the former Main Hall of Clifton College, the organization offers a local outlet for visual and performing arts unique for a city of Clifton&#x27;s size. Among its many offerings are a performing theater, classes in a variety of subjects, an annual photography show and a nationally recognized art show, the Conservatory Art Classic. Clifton has twice been designated as one of the top 100 small art communities in the nation. It is home to nationally recognized artists, including several members of the prestigious Cowboy Artists of America. Artist Merritt Mauzey received the first Guggenheim Foundation fellowship in fine arts ever awarded to a Texan in 1946. His works are sold locally at the Bosque County Emporium.

<text>Cranfills Gap is a city located in Bosque County in central Texas, United States. It was founded by Norwegian Emigrants and to this day most residents can trace their lineage to those Norwegian Founders. The Bosque county area surrounding Cranfills Gap is listed on the National Register of Historic places as the Norse Historic District. The population was 277 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area in which Cranfills Gap is located was originally settled by and named for George Eaton Cranfill in 1851.

Norwegian settlers in and around the community, who were mostly Lutheran, built St. Olaf Kirke (&quot;kirke&quot; is Norwegian for &quot;church&quot;) in a rural area just outside Cranfills Gap. St. Olaf Kirke, commonly referred to as The Rock Church, is a small Lutheran church located in the unincorporated rural community of Norse, Texas. Among the pioneers in Norse was Cleng Peerson. The founder of Norse was Ole Canuteson (Ole Knudsen) from the Stavanger region of Norway. In 1917, as the congregation of that church began to grow, a new church was built for the congregation inside the town.

The town slowly grew to its peak population of 600 in 1940. During World War II, Cranfills Gap was the first town to sell more than its quota of war bonds for the Fourth War Loan Drive. While as many as 25 businesses operated within &quot;the gap&quot;, as locals commonly refer to it, the population and the business activity slowly dwindled to roughly nine businesses in 1980 and a population of 269 in 1990.

On December 3, 2008, KXXV-TV in nearby Waco reported on its website that Cranfills Gap had been selected for participation in an advertising campaign for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. The selection process compared hundreds of rural communities from across the USA seeking &quot;the most unique all-American town in all of the 50 states.&quot; Cranfills Gap was first contacted by the LVCVA in October 2008 when the town was placed on the list of ten candidate communities. A film crew and LVCVA representative visited the town for a few days and interviewed residents about the town, their impressions of and experience with Las Vegas, and their opinions about the ongoing selection process. In November 2008, Cranfills Gap Chamber of Commerce members were notified that the LVCVA had shortened the list to two finalists including their town. Another LVCVA delegation was dispatched to Cranfills Gap for a closer look. The visitors stayed for about a week and conducted a fresh set of interviews and observed the community at work and play. Although the LVCVA had initially intended to send 150 residents from the winning locality to Sin City, the Cranfills Gap Chamber of Commerce and elected officials struck a feasible compromise with their visitors: if selected, Cranfills Gap would make every effort to provide one hundred adult men and women for the LVCVA&#x27;s project. During the first week of December 2008, Cranfills Gap and local media were notified by LVCVA that the town had won the nationwide search and 100 of its residents would be sent on a free trip to Las Vegas during the weekend of December 5–7, 2008. Cranfills Gap City Council member Ron Hubbard told the press that he sincerely hoped Cranfills Gap would reap benefits from the ad campaign beyond just plane tickets and memories. &quot;With that national recognition, maybe people will come visit, see what we&#x27;re all about,&quot; said Hubbard.

<text>Maud is a city in Bowie County, Texas, United States, within the Texarkana metropolitan area. According to the 2020 U.S. census, it had a population of 977.

==History==
Maud is situated by the St. Louis Southwestern Railway, near U.S. Highway 67 in southern Bowie County. The territory around Maud, known before the Republic of Texas era as the Red River Country, was among the earliest settled areas, but Spanish claims to the land, outlaws from the Neutral Ground, and general lawlessness discouraged extensive development. Before the city of Maud was established, the historic Trammel Trace road went just south of the city, where the crossing of the Sulphur River was made via Epperson&#x27;s Ferry.

After the railroad reached the site in 1870, a community gradually began to emerge. The town was named for Maud Knapp, daughter of Samuel D. Knapp, the first postmaster and the donor of land for the townsite. A post office opened in 1881, closed the next year, then reopened in 1893. By 1910, the population of the town had reached 300, and by 1940 it had grown to 750. During World War II, the Red River Army Depot and the Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant were built north of the community. These two facilities provided jobs for many Maud citizens. In 1982, Maud had eleven rated businesses and an estimated population of 1,059. The two military installations remained the largest employers of Maud residents. In 1990, the community population was 1,049.

<doc id="135524" wikidata="Q978847" url="?curid=135524" title="Nash, Texas">
<text>Nash is a city in Bowie County, Texas, United States, and a suburb of Texarkana. It is part of the Texarkana metropolitan area. The population was 2,960 at the 2010 census, up from 2,169 at the 2000 census. In 2020, its population was 3,814, representing continued population growth as a suburban community.

==History==

===Early years===
Long before the birth of Nash, the land on which it is located was in the name of the State of Texas. The State of Texas patented the land which makes up the eastern portion of Nash to William Crutcher on December 19, 1849. The west portion of Nash was patented to Josiah W. Fort, assignee of Thomas Price on December 18, 1951.

===Growth period===
Originally, the town of Nash was first called &quot;T. C. Junction&quot; or sometimes Texarkana Junction for its location on the transcontinental division of the Texas and Pacific Railway, which officially was entitled from its construction days as the Trans-Continental Division. The first railroad track was built from Marshall eastward to T.C. Junction in 1873. The official origin date of the town is unknown, but records indicate Nash began sometime between 1873 and the late 1880s.

In 1884, the town was renamed &quot;Park&quot;, after Dr. John N. Parker, who received a grant for a post office. He was the first postmaster. Dr. Parker changed the name of the town to &quot;Park&quot; because the government would not accept such a long name as Trans-Continental Junction; therefore, he used his own name dropping the &quot;er&quot;. In 1906, the town was renamed again to &quot;Nash&quot;, in honor of Martin Manny Nash, the Division Superintendent for the Texas &amp; Pacific Railroad Company.

The first school started in 1885, in a single room by Dr. K. M. Kelley, located on the corner of Dodd and Elm streets. In 1890, the town had a store, a pharmacy, two mills, a cotton gin, and 100 inhabitants. In 1894, the town was struck by a cyclone that destroyed one-third of the town, demolishing the first school, the Methodist church, the Baptist Church, several dwellings, and killing two people.

The town of Nash has two cemeteries. The oldest one, referred to as the Handley or Blocker Cemetery, dates back to 1876. This cemetery is the burial place of two Confederate soldiers of the Confederate &quot;army:&quot; T.P. Wagnon, Pvt Co. E. Ragsdale Battn. Cav., and James Bentley, Co. B. 41st Alabama Regiment, who was with Robert E. Lee when he surrendered. The Nash Cemetery, the second oldest cemetery, is the burial place of the following Confederate soldiers: Joshua R. Brower, A.J. Herrington, Ruben L. Redden, George R. Robinson, George W. Simpson, William G. Blocker, Pvt Co. G. Third Regiment Alabama, and John King.

During the 1950s, the town was incorporated and began to grow again. In 1980, many Nash residents were employed either in Texarkana or at one of two nearby military installations: Red River Army Depot and Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant, located a few miles west of the town. The population was 2,169 in 2000.

<text>New Boston is a city in Bowie County, Texas, United States. Boston was named for an early storekeeper in the settlement, W.J. Boston. The coming of the railroads led to the location of two more Bostons. A depot was built approximately four miles north of Boston and was named New Boston. The original Boston then became Old Boston. The courthouse was moved to Texarkana in the early 1880s, but a later election carried to move the courthouse back to the geographic center of the county. This location was between the Bostons. The Post Office Department named this location Boston, so Bowie County has claim to three Bostons: New Boston, Boston, and Old Boston. The population was 4,550 at the 2010 census, and 4,612 in 2020.

==History==

The Red River Expedition (1806) was stopped by the Spanish in the vicinity of the town.

When the Missouri Pacific Railroad was being constructed north of the village of Boston (now Old Boston) in the summer of 1876, it was clear to many businessmen in the town that it would suffer a serious decline as a result of its distance from the line. At a mass meeting, J. H. Smelser, a local resident and surveyor for the railroad, was selected to meet with railroad officials to secure the location of a depot at a point on the line nearest to Boston. The negotiations were successful, and in September 1876, lots were laid out and put up for sale on that the railroad had purchased. Because most of those engaged in the project were from Boston, the new town was named New Boston.

A post office was established in 1877 with L. C. DeMorse as postmaster. The town grew rapidly, and by 1884, it had 400 residents, two churches, a school, several mills and gins, and a newspaper, the &quot;New Boston Herald&quot;, edited by W. W. West. A furniture factory and another newspaper, the &quot;Bowie County Populist&quot;, were added in the 1890s.

By 1900, the town had a population of 762. It grew slowly until the late 1920s, when a short-lived boom raised the population from 869 in 1925 to 1,300 in 1929. The population fell to 949 by 1931. During World War II, the Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant and the Red River Army Depot were constructed just southeast of New Boston. The two massive military installations were probably responsible for the town&#x27;s rapid growth in the 1940s. The population grew from 1,111 in 1940, then to 2,688 in 1950. In 1980, it reached 4,628. Although an International Paper mill, the Barry Telford state prison and a few smaller factories provided some industrial base for the town, New Boston depends heavily on the two military installations for its continued prosperity. The town had 5,057 residents in 1990 and 4,550 residents in 2010.

New Boston is known for its Pioneer Days Festival and Rodeo. The townfolk gather at the T&amp;P Trailhead Park for entertainment such as carnival rides, street dances, and live musical and comedy presentations.

On the evening of November 4, 2022, an EF3 tornado hit the western outskirts of the city, causing minor damage.

<text>Redwater is a city in Bowie County, Texas, United States. The population was 853 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Texarkana metropolitan area.

==History==
Redwater is twelve miles southwest of Texarkana in southeastern Bowie County. It grew up in the mid-1870s around a sawmill operated by two men named Daniels and Spence, who named the community Ingersoll, in honor of the agnostic Robert Ingersoll. A post office was established in 1881, and by 1884 the town had an estimated population of fifty.

In 1886 a big revival meeting was held in the town, which resulted in about 110 conversions. Shortly after the meeting residents of the town, no longer wishing to honor the agnostic, decided that the name of the town should be changed. They had just completed a new well that yielded red water, and the town was renamed for this feature. The name of the post office was not officially changed until 1894. Although the population of the town swelled to an estimated 300 by 1892, by 1900 it had fallen to 128. It reached 250 in the 1920s.

During World War II the Red River Army Depot and Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant were built just north of Redwater, providing thousands of jobs for county residents. The population of Redwater jumped from 250 in the early 1940s to 457 by 1950. In 1982 Redwater had a population of 460 and five rated businesses. In 1990 the population was 894.

<text>Texarkana is a city in Bowie County, Texas, United States, in the Ark-La-Tex region. Located approximately from Dallas, Texarkana is a twin city with neighboring Texarkana, Arkansas. The Texas city&#x27;s population was 36,193 at the 2020 census.

The city and its Arkansas counterpart form the core of the Texarkana metropolitan statistical area, encompassing all of Bowie County, Texas, and Miller County, Arkansas. The two cities had a combined population of 65,580 in the 2020 decennial census, and the metropolitan area had a population of 149,482.

==History==

Railroads were quick to see the possibilities of connecting markets in this vast area. In the late 1850s, the builders of the Cairo and Fulton Railroad were pushing their line steadily south across Arkansas. By 1874, they crossed the Red River and reached the Texas state line. Between February 16 and March 19, 1874, trains ran between the Texas border and the Red River, whence passengers and freight were ferried north to Fulton, Arkansas to continue by rail. The Red River Bridge opened on March 20, 1874. Since then, trains have run directly from Texarkana to St. Louis, Missouri.

Keen rivalry existed between the 1870s railroad builders. The Texas and Pacific Railroad reached across Texas to the Arkansas state line. The border was the logical place for the different railways to connect. On December 8, 1873, the Texas and Pacific sold the first town lots for the future city. The first buyer was J. W. Davis, who purchased the land where today&#x27;s Hotel McCartney now stands on the Texas side of the border, opposite Union Station which is split between both the Arkansas and Texas border.

==Etymology==

The name Texarkana is known to be a portmanteau of Texas, Arkansas, and nearby Louisiana. However, accounts of the name&#x27;s origin differ, and it had been in use some time before the town was founded. The most popular tradition is that when the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway was building its line through the area, Col. Gus Knobel, a railroad surveyor, coined the name. He is said to have painted it on a plank and nailed it to a tree, saying &quot;This is the name of a town which is to be built here.&quot; Another story tells of a Red River steamboat named &quot;The Texarkana&quot;, . A third account relates that a storekeeper named Swindle in Red Land, Louisiana, concocted a drink called &quot;Texarkana Bitters&quot;.

==Geography==

Texarkana is located at the junction of Interstate 30 and US highways 59, 67, 71 and 82 in extreme northeastern Texas on the Texas-Arkansas border. It is bordered by the city of Texarkana, Arkansas, to the east, and by the smaller cities of Nash, Wake Village and Liberty Eylau, Texas to the west. It is in the Central Time Zone.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Texas city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.39%, is covered by water. The city is roughly 180 miles northeast of Dallas.

Several creeks run through the area including Wagner Creek, Cowhorn Creek, Swampoodle Creek and Days Creek.

===Climate===

== History ==
Brazoria was founded in 1828 on land granted by Stephen F. Austin to John Austin, who laid out the town. The town&#x27;s name was selected by John Austin, &quot;for the single reason that I know of none like it in the world&quot;. Supposedly, the first Masonic lodge in Texas was founded in 1835 when six men met under the Masonic Oak in Brazoria. The following year, the town was nearly deserted during the Runaway Scrape. H. M. Shaw opened a school in Brazoria in 1838 and a post office opened in 1846. The community&#x27;s 1884 population was served by 12 general stores, five churches, three hotels, good schools, cotton gins, and sugar mills. By 1890 the town had become the county seat. Two years later the &quot;Velasco World&quot; weekly newspaper began publishing in the town.

However, the railroad bypassed Brazoria and it lost the county seat to Angleton in 1897. The town went into decline. The Brazoria school boasted three teachers and 142 students in 1906. The &quot;Banner&quot; weekly news started publishing in 1914. The local discovery of oil and sulphur in 1939 and the construction of a bridge across the Brazos River helped restore the town&#x27;s fortunes. By 1987 Brazoria counted 50 businesses. Brazoria celebrates Frontier Days in March, the No Name Festival in June, and the Santa Ana Ball in July.

<text>Clute is a city in Brazoria County, Texas, United States, within the Houston metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 10,604. The city gained some fame with the discovery of a fossilized mammoth named Asiel.

==History==
Clute&#x27;s history began at the junction of the old Calvit and Eagle Island Plantations. Alexander Calvit, one of Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s Old Three Hundred, obtained title to the land in 1824. Eagle Island Plantation belonged to Jared Groce, the richest man in Austin&#x27;s Colony. Calvit&#x27;s plantation later became the Herndon sugar plantation, owned by John H. Herndon, who married Calvit&#x27;s only daughter.

After the American Civil War, Joseph Pegan, Soloman (or Solomon) J. Clute, and several relatives including George and John Clute, founded a community near the plantation site. In 1881, the name Clute was adopted when both plantations were bought by Solomon J. Clute. George was described as, &quot;a little Yankee from New York with a long, white beard.&quot; The other founders of Clute have also been described as northerners. The Clutes acquired additional land from Herndon, who put it up for auction in the 1870s. A deed dated March 17, 1886, transferred ownership from Soloman J. Clute to George Clute for property known as Clute&#x27;s Place. Soloman Clute administered the community until 1888 or 1889, when it was sold. The Eagle Island Plantation of William H. Wharton occupied the site of present Restwood Memorial Park.

In 1933, Clute had only two businesses and a population of ten. By 1937 the town had a school for white children with two teachers and two schools for black children with one teacher each. In the early 1940s, Clute began to prosper with the advent of Dow Chemical and several large construction companies moving into Southern Brazoria County. A post office was established by 1943, and a new grade school was built in the 1950s.

In 1950, Clute had a population of 700 and thirty-six businesses; in 1954 the residents numbered 3,200 and the businesses forty-five. Clute was incorporated in May 1952 under the name Clute City, with a commission form of government; in 1955 the town changed its name back to Clute and adopted an alderman (city council) form of government.

Brazoswood High School opened in Clute in 1969 with grades 9–11. The first class graduated 356 students in May 1971. Brazoswood won the state championship in football in 1974.

==Mammoth discovery==
In November 2003, a pair of mammoth tusks were found buried in a sand pit near Brazoswood High School by a backhoe operator. They are believed to be remains of the first-dated mammoth discovered on the Texas Gulf Coast.

The mammoth was judged to be about 38,000 years old, judging from the age of logs recovered near the site, and was considered to be a Columbian mammoth. These mammoths were slightly larger and less hairy than their famous cousin, the woolly mammoth. In addition, fossil logs and remains of bison, horse, deer and turtle are present, providing a glimpse of a unique Ice Age environment buried 35 feet below the surface, said Robson Bonnichsen, director of the Center for the Study of the First Americans.

There is now a restaurant/museum of the same name to honor the discovery.

<doc id="135537" wikidata="Q973220" url="?curid=135537" title="Damon, Texas">
<text>Damon is a census-designated place (CDP) in Brazoria County, Texas, United States. The population was 436 at the 2020 census. The town is located about south of Rosenberg on Texas State Highway 36. Damon sits partly atop a salt dome which was exploited for petroleum, sulphur, and limestone.

==Geography==
Damon is located in northwestern Brazoria County at (29.289519, -95.737038). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

Damon is from the San Bernard River and from the Brazos River. The community is between Needville in Fort Bend County and West Columbia in Brazoria County.

Damon is home to the highest point in Brazoria County, Damon Mound, rising above sea level.

The west part of the town sits atop Damon Mound, the surface expression of a salt diapir or dome. The plug of salt rises through geological formations of Tertiary geologic age. The top of the salt mass is about below the surface and above it are limestone, gypsum, and anhydrite. Petroleum was trapped around the salt dome in sandstone and limestone layers. Five million barrels of crude oil were extracted from 85 wells in the years up to 1924. In the year 1930 alone the mound yielded 224,000 barrels of oil.

==History==
The Karankawa people lived on Damon Mound before the arrival of Europeans. Arrowheads, burial grounds, broken pottery, and stone tools found in the area are evidence of their habitation. In ancient times, the mound&#x27;s sour earth was regarded by the local native peoples as having medicinal properties. This feature was caused by the presence of sulphur and other minerals near the surface.

The area was first settled by Europeans in 1831 when Samuel Damon arrived from the United States. Damon married Lorena Darst and built a home on the south side of the mound. The settlement grew until it counted 100 inhabitants in 1890 when it was called Damon Mound. At that time cattle ranching was an important business. In 1895, the post office reopened after having been closed for three years. The town was renamed Damon around that time. A Baptist church opened in 1896. In 1918 a railroad line was built from Rosenberg to Damon in order to haul away the limestone and sulphur that were quarried from the mound.

In 1925, the town had 300 residents and a Catholic church was founded. The population dipped to 260 in 1931 at which time the town had its own school district. In 1944 the railroad line was discontinued beyond Guy to the north. Nevertheless, Damon&#x27;s population reached nearly 400 from the 1940s to the 1980s. In 1989 there were 375 residents, a feed store, cotton gin, quarry and other businesses. The 2000 census reported 535 persons and Baptist, Catholic, Church of Christ, and Lutheran places of worship.

Although not directly on a railroad line, Iowa Colony was served by the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe line through nearby Manvel. The population grew slowly to twenty-seven and remained at that level until the mid-1960s. The discovery of oil in 1948 brought regional employment to the area. By 1961 the Iowa Colony post office had closed, yet during the 1960s the settlement began to grow vigorously as part of the greater Houston area. By 1973 Iowa Colony had been incorporated (in 1972), and by 1989 the town listed a population of 661.

In 1911 and 1912, an elementary school and a previous version of Iowa Colony High School, respectively, were established. Iowa Colony&#x27;s school district later became a part of Alvin ISD. Alvin High School served all Iowa Colony residents, until fall 2006, when Manvel High opened to immediately accept 9th and 10th grades and phase in 11th and 12th grades in two years. After 2006 and prior to Iowa Colony High&#x27;s opening, Manvel High&#x27;s boundary included all of Iowa Colony. Prior to the opening of Meridiana Elementary, zoned elementary schools were E. C. Mason, Don Jeter, and Savannah Lakes in Manvel. Residents were divided between Manvel Junior High and Fairview Junior High in Alvin. In 2015 Manvel Junior High became the junior high for almost all of Iowa Colony, except a small portion zoned to Rodeo Palms Junior High. In 2022 Iowa Colony High will open, relieving Manvel High.

Additionally, Alvin Community College provides basic undergraduate courses and adult education. Iowa Colony is in the ACC taxation zone.

===Highways===
Texas State Highway 332 extends from its west end SH 36 in Brazoria to its east end at Surfside Beach.

===Streets===
* The city&#x27;s layout and the six designs for homes were completed by Michigan architect Alden B. Dow.
* All streets radiating from downtown end in the word &quot;Way.&quot; Among the streets are Center Way, Winding Way, Circle Way, and Parking Way. There is an intersection of two streets named This Way and That Way. In the same spirit, a local church near Bess Brannen Elementary placed a small sign in their driveway named His Way. There is also an Any Way.
* Most other streets were named after some form of flora. As the city grew and common names such as Pine, Mulberry, and Oak were taken, developers had to become more creative; thus, among the plants used are Jalapeño, Tangerine, Mango, and Habañero. The highways running through Lake Jackson, (Texas Highways 288 &amp; 332) and Oyster Creek Drive, are exceptions to the naming conventions. The naming convention of &quot;Drive,&quot; meaning a route into or out of town, is less honored today than in the beginning.
* Dow intentionally laid out the streets so that they seldom follow straight paths. He wanted to maintain as many trees as possible, a principle still practiced in the development of new subdivisions. In addition, he thought that curving streets provided more surprises in unfolding vistas. Lake Jackson is a part of the National Arbor Day Foundation&#x27;s Tree City USA list. Also, many of the streets follow Oyster Creek, which twists and winds through town. In many areas of town one can travel in any of the four compass directions and have the same commute time and distance to a destination across town.

It is licensed for 20 inpatient beds, and is a Level IV Trauma Center with a dedicated surgical suite.

==History==
Sweeny&#x27;s settlement, though not under this name, began before Texas was even a Republic. Imla Keep, a doctor and member of Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s Old Three Hundred colonists, received title to a league and labor of land that included the site of Sweeny on July 24, 1824. Keep eventually returned to Louisiana, and Martin Varner acquired the land. The land was named for John Sweeny, a Tennessee colonist who arrived with family members and 250 slaves in the area in 1833. He came after his sons, William Burrell and Thomas Jefferson Sweeny, had purchased land grants near the townsite. They purchased the land grants for the price of a load of mules, and came to examine their new land holdings in 1831. John Sweeny settled nearby, and in 1835, purchased the original Imla Keep League from Varner and constructed a house on the site. The home, today the Sweeny Plantation, a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark, was occupied by original family members through the 1990s. The original home was built in 1837 by slaves using only bricks, nails, and cypress and ash wood from the land. There were also 30 slave cabins made of cypress wood. The plantation had its own sawmill, sugar house, cotton gin, blacksmith shop, commissary, and a kiln for brick manufacture.

The town was named for John Sweeny.

The original town stood in a forest of hardwoods with soil twenty feet deep. Sweeny was briefly called Adamston when the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway reached the area in 1905 and laid a side track lined with gardens to the community. A post office was established in 1895, closed in 1897, and was reestablished in 1909 as Sweeny. Sweeny&#x27;s cotton gin and general store were built by 1908, a school was organized in 1911 with eleven students, and church services were held in 1912, when a Civic Club was founded to promote civic and social improvements. Around 1910 the R. D. McDonald Bernard River Land Development Company, which later gave a plot of land to each church denomination, purchased acreage in the area, cut it into lots, and sold it.

Burton D. Hurd platted the townsite in 1911. His Burton D. Hurd Industrial Land Company promoted ten-acre suburban garden farms in the area with the slogan, &quot;Soil Richer Than the Valley of the River Nile&quot; to prospective settlers.

By 1914 the community had a hotel, a flour mill, three general stores, a cotton gin, a gristmill, a sawmill, and a population of 200. In the 1920s Sweeny shipped cotton, vegetables, live-oak parts for ships, and, for a time, bullfrogs raised by area farmers. In 1918 it had a brick factory and an orange orchard. Sweeny had an independent school system by 1912; school enrollment reached 236 by 1927, and by 1937 the community had three black schools and an all-grade white school with six teachers. The Ku Klux Klan operated briefly and held one cross-burning in the community.

In 1934, oil was discovered in Old Ocean, creating development which made Sweeny prosper. In 1942, a government carbon black plant was built which was taken over by Phillips Petroleum, which developed the facilities into a refinery, natural gas liquids center, and petrochemicals complex with pipelines to markets in the eastern United States. In 2000, Phillips Petroleum merged with Conoco Inc. to form ConocoPhillips. Sweeny&#x27;s population in the latter 20th century has fluctuated from 3,087 to 3,699.

Schools in the district are Sweeny Elementary (K–5), Sweeny Junior High (6–8) and Sweeny High School (9–12), which is a 4A school. In 2007, construction began on the high school to renovate the older building. With growing security concerns, the Board of Trustees approved the renovation of the school, because most of the campus was open to the outside. The current school now has limited outside access. Classes met in the newly renovated building December 1, 2008.

The Texas Legislature assigned the area in Sweeny ISD to the Brazosport College district. Brazosport College and Wharton County Junior College are both within a 45-minute drive of Sweeny.

Elementary: Pre K–5th grade

Junior High: 6th–8th grade

==History==
Columbia was established in 1826 by Josiah Hughes Bell when the town was laid out two miles west of Marion, later known as East Columbia. Columbia was briefly the capital of the Republic of Texas from September to December 1836. The town hosted the First Congress of the Republic of Texas when Sam Houston became president on October 22, 1836. The House of Representatives and Senate each met in private homes. The First Congress voted to move the capital to Houston on November 30 because Columbia lacked living quarters for government officials. On December 27, 1836, Stephen F. Austin died at the home of George B. McKinstry in Columbia.

The town, which became known as West Columbia, saw its commerce decline after the government moved away. A post office was set up in 1905. When oil was discovered in the West Columbia oil field in 1918, the town became a center for cotton, oil, rice and sulphur. By 1928, the town&#x27;s population rose to 2,500, but the ill-effects of the Great Depression caused the number of residents to fall to about 1,000. In 1940 there were 1,573 persons living in West Columbia and 50 businesses. During the 1950s, the population increased to 2,100. By the 1960s big oil companies had a considerable presence near town and the area boasted the most cattle in the state. In 1960 West Columbia had 2,947 residents, in 1970 it had 3,335 and in 1990 it had 4,372. In the next two decades the population dipped slightly. Varner-Hogg Plantation State Historic Site is near West Columbia.

<text>Bryan is a city in and the county seat of Brazos County, Texas, United States. It is located in the heart of the Brazos Valley (East and Central Texas). As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 83,980. Bryan borders the city of College Station, which lies to its south. Together they make up the Bryan–College Station metropolitan area, the 15th-largest metropolitan area in Texas with 268,248 people as of 2020.

==History==

The area around Bryan was part of a land grant to Moses Austin by Spain. Austin&#x27;s son, Stephen F. Austin, helped bring settlers to the area. Among the settlers was William Joel Bryan, the nephew of Stephen Austin. In 1866 the county seat of Brazos County was changed from Boonville to Bryan, and a post office was opened. In 1867, after many delays caused by the Civil War, the Houston and Texas Central Railroad, which had only previously gotten as far as Millican, finally reached Bryan. A short time later, in 1871, the city of Bryan became incorporated. Just south of Bryan, Texas A&amp;M College opened in 1876 in what later would be known as College Station. The following year, 1877 saw the establishment of the Bryan Independent School District. Keeping up with progress in the rest of the country, Bryan added electric lighting and a waterworks to its community in 1889. The fifth Brazos County courthouse was built in 1892, and by the turn of the century, in 1900, the International-Great Northern Railroad stopped in Bryan.

Using a generous grant of $10,000 from Andrew Carnegie, the Carnegie Library of Bryan opened its doors in 1902. A bell, made in 1905 and rung in 1918 to signal the end of World War I is still located out front today. In 1910 the town built an interurban railroad to College Station. By 1923 the line was abandoned. The first Jewish place of worship, the Temple Freda synagogue, was opened in 1913. During the 1930s the town of North Oakwood merged with Bryan. Now Bryan and College Station are &quot;twin&quot; cities. In 1936 State Highway 6 was built, running right through town.

In 2006, the Texas A&amp;M University System announced that the new Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center campus would be built in Bryan near the new Traditions Golf Course development.

A fire at the El Dorado Chemical Co. in 2009 caused the evacuation of 70,000 residents due to the burning of ammonium nitrate, possibly causing minor respiratory problems. However, the city requested that only &quot;anyone who can smell smoke or see smoke to evacuate their homes and businesses&quot; and did not enforce an evacuation except for 500 homes in the nearby vicinity of the fire. Less than 1,000 residents chose to evacuate, taking shelter at Texas A&amp;M University, which closed its campus for the day to ease traffic problems. City fire officials chose to let the fire burn down before tackling it, since the chemicals were water reactive. The evacuation, which started at 2:30 pm CST ended at 7 pm, except for a small, defined area immediately around the fire, where approximately 100 Bryan residents lived. In the end, only 500 residents were under a mandatory evacuation, and 35 people were treated for respiratory problems from the smoke. Officials from El Dorado said there was never any danger from the smoke or fire. The warehouse, valued at just under $1 million, was destroyed.

In 2010, the Brazos County District Attorney&#x27;s Office started the enforcement of a &quot;Gang Safety Zone&quot; in response to an escalation in violence within Bryan. Major US papers and ABC News covered this move. Cities like Houston and Los Angeles looked to the Bryan model of safety enforcement surrounding gang violence. The injunction declared a area in Bryan as the Gang Safety Zone. This placed about half of downtown in the area.

In 2013 the Planned Parenthood clinic in Bryan closed as a result of state budget cuts which impacted family-planning facilities. The facility began offering abortions in 1998; it was one of three in the state which ceased operations on August 31, 2013.

On April 8, 2021, a workplace shooting occurred in Bryan. An employee of Kent Moore Cabinets, a local cabinet-making company, killed one person and injured five others, four of them critically. He then fled but was later taken into police custody, shooting and injuring a state trooper in the process. In June, 27-year-old suspect Larry Bollin was indicted by a grand jury on charges of murder and aggravated assault. In late November, 2023, he was found mentally unfit to stand trial by the Judge Holden.

<text>College Station is a city in Brazos County, Texas, United States, situated in East-Central Texas in the Brazos Valley, towards the eastern edge of the region known as the Texas Triangle. It is northwest of Houston and east-northeast of Austin. As of the 2020 census, College Station had a population of 120,511. College Station and Bryan make up the Bryan-College Station metropolitan area, the 15th-largest metropolitan area in Texas with 268,248 people as of 2020.

College Station is home to the main campus of Texas A&amp;M University, the flagship institution of the Texas A&amp;M University System. The city owes its name and existence to the university&#x27;s location along a railroad. Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s triple designation as a land-grant university, National Sea Grant College Program, and National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program reflects the broad scope of the research endeavors it brings to the city, with ongoing projects funded by agencies such as NASA, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research.

== History==

College Station&#x27;s origins date from 1860, when the Houston and Texas Central Railway began to build through the region. Eleven years later, the site was chosen as the location for the proposed Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, a land-grant school. In 1876, as the nation celebrated its centennial, the school (renamed Texas A&amp;M University in 1963) opened its doors as the first public institution of higher education in the state of Texas.

College Station&#x27;s population grew slowly, reaching 350 in 1884 and 391 at the turn of the century. However, during this time, transportation improvements took place in the town. In 1900, the I&amp;GN Railroad was extended to College Station (the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company abandoned the line in 1965), and 10 years later, electric interurban service was established between Texas A&amp;M and the neighboring town of Bryan. A city bus system replaced the interurban in the 1920s.

In 1930, the community to the north of College Station, known as North Oakwood, was incorporated as part of Bryan. College Station did not incorporate until October 19, 1938, after a 217-39 vote, with John H. Binney as the first mayor. Within a year, the city established a zoning commission, and by 1940, the population had reached 2,184.

The city grew under the leadership of Ernest Langford, called by some the &quot;Father of College Station&quot;, who began a 26-year stretch as mayor in 1942. Early in his first term, the city adopted a council-manager system of city government.

Population growth accelerated following World War II as the nonstudent population reached 7,898 in 1950, 11,396 in 1960, 17,676 in 1970, 30,449 in 1980, 52,456 in 1990, and 67,890 in 2000. The Bryan-College Station metropolitan area&#x27;s population crossed 270,000 people in 2018.

In the 1990s, College Station and Texas A&amp;M University drew national attention when the George Bush Presidential Library opened in 1997. Attention was drawn again in 1999, when 12 people were killed and 27 injured when the Aggie Bonfire collapsed while being constructed.

In 2022, it became one of the first areas served by Amazon&#x27;s Prime Air drone delivery service, along with Lockeford, California.

==Districts==
===Northgate===
Northgate is a mixed-use district north of Texas A&amp;M University that features a combination of businesses, restaurants, apartments, churches, and entertainment. It is known for its eclectic mix of restaurants and bars. A large portion of the stores, bars, and restaurants in Northgate are frequented, patronized, and staffed by Texas A&amp;M students. In total, the district spans about , bounded by Wellborn Road to the west, South College Avenue to the east, the College Station city limits to the north, and University Drive to the south. The district is the home of the Dixie Chicken.

Northgate&#x27;s roots started in the 1930s as the city began enjoying rapid population growth from the influx of Texas A&amp;M University students, professors, and their families. Realizing that proximity to the campus would be a boon for revenues, the first business district was established in College Station near the campus, taking its name for the closest on-campus landmark: the north gate. When the city was incorporated in 1938, its first City Hall was opened in the new district. In 1994, restoration efforts began to revitalize the ailing area. A four-day music festival, &quot;North By Northgate&quot;, was introduced in 1998 and has become an annual tradition, renamed the &quot;Northgate Music Festival&quot; in 2002. In 2006, the city council incorporated Northgate as a special tax zone to finance additional improvements and expansions.

Live music is a major draw to the Northgate area. Many well-known musicians, especially in the Texas country music scene, initially performed in the Northgate area. Notable names include Robert Earl Keen, Grammy award-winner Lyle Lovett, Dub Miller, and Roger Creager. The district is bisected to the north by Church Street, made famous by the Robert Earl Keen and Lyle Lovett duet &quot;The Front Porch Song&quot;.

===Wolf Pen Creek District===

Wolf Pen Creek District is a large commercial development adjacent to Post Oak Mall and between two of the city&#x27;s main commercial thoroughfares: Earl Rudder Freeway and Texas Avenue. The area consists of a greenway with trails, a $1.5 million amphitheater and entertainment area, a small lake, the Spirit Ice Arena, and is the home of the Arts Council of the Brazos Valley. The amphitheater has hosted a variety of musical events, including the annual Starlight Music Series, a concert series that starts in late spring and runs through late summer. Wolf Pen also has a sidewalk for a scenic run that when completed is about .

===Wellborn District===
Wellborn became a community in 1867 as a construction camp on the Houston and Texas Central Railroad. The town&#x27;s name has been attributed to a well at the construction camp, a foreman named E.W. Wellborn, or a landowner named W.W. Willburn. Also in 1867, a post office opened in the community under the name Wellborn Station. In 1870, the name was shortened to Wellborn. On April 14, 2011, the City Council of College Station voted 5–2 to annex Wellborn, thus making the community the Wellborn district. Wellborn is often mispronounced as &#x27;well-born&#x27; but is pronounced by locals as &#x27;Well-burn&#x27;.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 120,511 people, 41,682 households, and 20,487 families residing in the city.

As of the census of 2000, 67,890 people, 24,691 households, and 10,370 families resided in the city.
Of the 24,691 households, 21.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 32.2% were married couples living together, 6.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 58.0% were not families. About 27.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 2.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.32 and the average family size was 2.98. The racial makeup of the city as of 2019 was 77.45% White, 7.74% African American, 0.30% Native American, 10.25% Asian, 0.08% Pacific Islander, 6.32% from other races, and 2.3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any ethnicity/nationality were 15.6% of the population.

In the city, the population was distributed as 14.4% under the age of 18, 51.2% from 18 to 24, 21.3% from 25 to 44, 9.4% from 45 to 64, and 3.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22 years. For every 100 females, there were 104.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 104.0 males.

===Income and Poverty===
Data from the ACS 1-year estimates indicates that the median income for a household in College Station was $47,632, a decrease from $52,397 reported in the 2020 census. According to Forbes, approximately 28.5% of the population lived below the poverty line in 2021, including 16.4% of those under age 18 and 7.7% of those aged 65 or older. The ACS 1-year estimates suggest this percentage may be as high as 30.2%, the highest poverty rate among U.S. cities with populations over 100,000. However, this statistic is likely impacted by the fact that Texas A&amp;M University has the largest student enrollment in the U.S.. The U.S. Census Bureau has noted that &quot;both in small counties with a large university and in large counties with multiple universities, the presence of college students who live off campus raises the community&#x27;s poverty rate.&quot;

==Government==
The city of College Station has a council-manager form of government. Voters elect the members of a city council, who pass laws and make policy. The council hires a professional city manager who is responsible for day-to-day operations of the city and its public services.

<text>Millican is an unincorporated community and former municipality in Brazos County, Texas, United States. The population was 240 at the 2010 census, up from 108 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Bryan–College Station metropolitan area. Millican is named after Robert Millican, the first white settler of the region that would come to be known as Brazos County.

==History==
The area was settled by Robert Hemphill Millican and his son Dr. Elliott McNeil Millican in the 1820&#x27;s. By 1845, it was known as Millican Crossroads, opening a post-office in 1849 and a stage-coach station in 1850.

As the terminus of the Houston and Texas Central Railway between 1860 and 1867, the town grew. It served as a training camp for 5,000 Confederate soldiers during the Civil War.

From July 15-17, 1868, Millican was the site of racial violence when a group of Blacks and a group of Whites confronted one another over the rumor of a lynching of a black man near the Brazos River. A skirmish erupted and lasted for several days in what one historian has called &quot;“the worst incident of racial violence in Texas during Reconstruction.”

The community was formerly an incorporated municipality. A letter sent to Greg Abbott, then the Texas Attorney General, from the Brazos County Attorney, Jim Kuboviak, stated that an either an election of 1866 or a &quot;special act&quot; law passed by the Texas Legislature had incorporated Millican as a municipality, and that the community had one person serving as mayor. However, after 1871, no municipal government officials had ever taken office, neither via appointment nor via being voted into power. By 2006 there was no collection of taxation for any municipal services, and Brazos County officials wanted Abbott to determine if Millican&#x27;s incorporation was still in effect. This would determine whether the county could make decisions with providing services to Millican. A lawyer that Brazos County used as a consultant had stated that she could not find proof that the municipality ever dissolved.

In November 2006 the Office of the Texas Attorney General made a ruling stating that Millican was not an incorporated municipality due to a law that was enacted in 1897 stating that a city which had no executive officials in a period of at least 10 years would automatically dissolve; this law was in effect until 1925, and so Millican would have dissolved automatically. The determination allowed a land developer to move forward with a project as there was no city council to deal with.

<doc id="135558" wikidata="Q661540" url="?curid=135558" title="Alpine, Texas">
<text>Alpine ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Brewster County, Texas, United States. The population was 6,035 at the 2020 census. The town has an elevation of , and the surrounding mountain peaks are over above sea level. A university, hospital, library, and retail make Alpine the center of the sprawling but wide open Big Bend area (combined population 12,500) including Brewster, Presidio, and Jeff Davis counties.

==History==

The area had been a campsite for cattlemen tending their herds between 1878 and the spring of 1882, when a town of tents was created by railroad workers and their families. Because the section of the railroad was called Osborne, that was the name of the small community for a brief time. The railroad needed access to water from springs owned by brothers named Daniel and Thomas Murphy, so it entered into an agreement with the Murphys to change the name of the section and settlement to Murphyville in exchange for a contract to use the spring. In November 1883, the Murphys registered a plat for the town of Murphyville with the county clerk of Presidio County.

The town&#x27;s name was changed to Alpine on February 3, 1888, following a petition by its residents. At this time, a description of the town mentioned a dozen houses, three saloons, a hotel and rooming house, a livery stable, a butcher shop, and a drugstore, which also housed the post office.

Alpine grew very slowly until Sul Ross State Normal College (now Sul Ross State University) was opened in 1920. The development of Big Bend National Park in the 1930s and &#x27;40s spurred further growth. The population was estimated at only 396 in 1904, but by 1927, it had risen to 3,000. The 1950 census reported Alpine&#x27;s population at 5,256, and a high of roughly 6,200 was reached by 1976. In 1990, the population was down to 5,637. In 2000, the population grew modestly to 5,786 and 5,905 by 2010.

The Holland Hotel, built during a brief mercury mining boom, was designed by Henry Trost, a distinguished regional architect. Today, it helps to anchor a traditional downtown of early 20th-century buildings still occupied by family-owned retailers and restaurants.

==Geography==
The town sits on a high plateau, in the Chihuahua Desert, with the Davis Mountains to the north and the Chisos Mountains to the south. Outcrops of ancient volcanic rocks spread to the northwest. Other layers of rocks have been exposed over time as the mountains were forced up and then eroded. The high elevation cools the desert air in the evenings.

Alpine is located on U.S. Route 90, approximately east of Marfa and 31 miles west of Marathon.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Alpine has a semiarid climate, &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

===Colleges and universities===
Sul Ross State University began as a teachers&#x27; college in 1920, with its original campus in Alpine. Named for Lawrence Sullivan Ross, a Confederate States Army general during the American Civil War, Texas&#x27; 19th governor and later president of the new land grant college which became Texas A&amp;M, it is now a member of the Texas State University System.

The 600-acre main campus on the lower slopes of Hancock Hill contains 20 or so buildings, most designed in Classical Revival style, and all faced with red brick and white trim. The hillside gives fine views of the town below and the surrounding mountain ranges. The Bar-SR-Bar brand of the college is whitewashed on stones high above. In 1981, students placed a desk on Hancock Hill and today visitors are invited to hike up to &quot;sign the register&quot;.

About 2,000 students attend here, many living in Lobo Village, which boasts 250 new apartment-style residence units. Both bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s programs are available in fields such as biology, behavioral and social sciences, business administration, computer science and mathematics, education, geology, law enforcement, and vocational nursing.

Sul Ross ranked number four in affordability among public universities according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. It was included in &quot;The Nation&#x27;s 30 Most Attractive Yet Affordable Campuses&quot;, published by AffordableSchools.net, based on its combined qualities of affordability and the beauty of the campus and surrounding area.

Intercollegiate sports include men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, cross country, track and field, and tennis, along with men&#x27;s baseball and women&#x27;s softball, men&#x27;s football and women&#x27;s soccer, and women&#x27;s volleyball. The teams are known as the Lobos, and play in the American Southwest Conference.

Sul Ross was the founding home of the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association in 1949. The Sul Ross Rodeo Club competes in 10 NIRA rodeos each year. The NIRA rodeo hosted in Alpine is a big event for the school and the community.

Brewster County is within the Odessa College District for community college.

===K–12 schools===

Alpine Independent School District serves more than 1,000 local students attending Alpine Elementary School, Alpine Middle School, and Alpine High School, in classes from Pre-K, Kindergarten, and first through 12th grades.

On the Texas Education Agency report card for 2013–2014, the high school, with 277 students in grades 9–12, reached &quot;Met Standard&quot; overall, while receiving Distinction designations in mathematics, social studies, top 25% closing performance gaps, and postsecondary readiness. Notably, average class sizes in Alpine High are only about two-thirds the state average. The Middle School, with 309 students in grades 5–8, also reached &quot;Met Standard&quot;, while receiving Distinction designations in mathematics and social Studies.

School colors are purple and old gold. The high school is home to the Alpine Fightin&#x27; Bucks and Lady Bucks. Sports include football, volleyball, cross-country, girls&#x27; basketball, boys&#x27; basketball, powerlifting, track and field, baseball, softball, golf, athletic training, and tennis.

==Museum==

The Museum of the Big Bend on the Sul Ross campus uses exhibits of Native American artifacts, cultural history, geology, paleontology, and Western art to introduce the visitor to the Big Bend region. Subjects include the area&#x27;s Indian tribes, the Buffalo soldiers, the mining era, the stagecoach, the railroad, and the history of Big Bend National Park. The overview includes historic photographs and short videos. The building was constructed in 1937 with local stone. Funding came from the Texas Centennial Commission and the Works Progress Administration, a federal make-work program during the Depression.

==Media==
In 1985 KVLF-AM, the only radio station licensed in Brewster County, was in Alpine. An individual quoted in a Federal Communications Commission report stated that in daylight hours it was possible to get radio from Fort Stockton.

The local daily paper is &quot;The Alpine Avalanche&quot; which has local news stories and advertisements, and it has almost no coverage of news outside of the area. Additionally Sul Ross students publish the &quot;Skyline&quot; and there is a resort sale publication called &quot;The Lajitas Sun&quot;. An FCC report in 1985 stated that while there was readership in the county for the &quot;San Angelo Standard Times&quot; and the &quot;Odessa American&quot;, &quot;The two papers seldom carry articles covering the Alpine area.&quot;

==Library==
Begun by volunteers in 1947, the Alpine Public Library remains an independent entity with its own board of directors, though it is well-supported by the taxpayers of Brewster County and the City of Alpine. The community institution has a staff, with additional work done by volunteers. Special programs, like a science club and computer learning, are aimed at users from preschoolers and teens to parents and retirees.

==Sites on National Register of Historic Places==
The Brewster County Courthouse and Jail was built in 1887–1888 by Tom Lovett, a local contractor, who apparently designed the buildings, as well. Open to visitors, historic photographs are displayed in the great hall.

The red brick courthouse is an example of the American Second Empire Style. The rectangular mass has five bays of paired round-arch window openings on the longer north and south facades. The shorter east and west facades have three bays. On three facades, the center bay contains a doorway at ground level, set in a thin, barely protruding pavilion. The second-story windows are slightly taller than the first-floor openings, a trick of the eye making the two-and-a-half-story building seem even taller. The walls are topped by a pressed-tin entablature composed of a frieze and cornice. The mansard roof is marked by steeply hipped pyramidal towers with pressed-tin cresting. The interior retains exemplary pressed-tin ceilings and some original woodwork. A wooden staircase with Eastlake-type details rises to the general courtroom on the second floor.

The adjoining Brewster County Jail is distinguished by a crenelated brick parapet wall, suggesting &quot;a fortress-like impregnability&quot;.

==Public art==
A mural in the former post office at 109 West E St was painted as part of the New Deal public works programs during the Great Depression. Surviving murals from the project are found in 60 or so Texas cities and towns. Completed in 1940, this mural is by a Spanish-born and trained artist, Jose Moya del Pino, who was living and working in San Francisco. In the foreground, three figures recline on a rocky overlook. They are each reading: a book, a magazine, and a tabloid newspaper, celebrating how the post office brings information and education to small towns and cattle ranches. On the horizon, the Twin Sisters Mountain mark the location, with the town in the middle distance, including, at the behest of townspeople, the characteristic red-brick buildings of the Sul Ross State campus.

<text>Falfurrias ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Brooks County, Texas, United States. Its population was 4,609 at the 2020 census, in a county that in the same census was just over 7,000. The town is named for founder Edward Cunningham Lasater&#x27;s ranch, La Mota de Falfurrias. In 1893, the Falfurrias ranch was one of the largest in Texas at some .

The biggest industry in Falfurrias is the United States Border Patrol interior checkpoint south of the city on U.S. Route 281. As an indirect consequence, many migrants seeking to bypass the checkpoint by setting off across the arid land die of exposure and dehydration.

Falfurrias and Brooks County were featured in a 2014 Latino USA radio story on illegal immigration in South Texas. The 2021 movie &quot;Missing in Brooks County&quot; deals with the same topic.

==History==
Falfurrias&#x27; founding and development were largely due to the efforts of Edward Cunningham Lasater, a pioneer Rio Grande Valley rancher and developer. In 1895, he started a cattle ranch in what was then northern Starr County. At one point, it was one of the largest ranches in Texas. With the extension of the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway south from Alice to his ranch in 1904, Lasater founded the town of Falfurrias and subdivided a sizable portion of his ranch land for sale to farmers. In 1898, a post office opened in the community. A local newspaper began publication in 1906. Lasater brought in his Jersey cows and established a creamery in 1909. Sweet-cream butter and other products from Edward Lasater&#x27;s creamery company made the town a familiar name across the state. That butter, though, is no longer made from milk produced in Falfurrias. Don Pedro Jaramillo, a Mexican-born &quot;curandero&quot; known as the &quot;Healer of Los Olmos&quot;, was buried in Falfurrias in 1907 and is venerated at a shrine there.

The state granted a petition by local residents to form a new county, Brooks, with Falfurrias as its county seat in 1911. Irrigation methods introduced to the area in the 1920s brought in truck farming and the citrus fruit industry. The city became a primary trade and shipping center for the surrounding region. The area received another economic boost in the 1930s and 1940s when extensive oil and gas reserves were discovered around Falfurrias.

The city had a population of 6,712 in 1950, which declined throughout the latter half of the 20th century; 5,297 people were living in Falfurrias in 2000, 4,981 in 2010, and 4,609 in 2020.

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection opened a station in Falfurrias in 1940; the present border checkpoint south of the city opened in 1994. It was renovated and enlarged in 2019, adding new cameras and X-ray machines. According to an NPR report, the station has been increasingly busy due to a surge of migrants coming from Central America. So many migrants die trying to hike around the checkpoint that there have been calls for it to be closed or moved.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Falfurrias&quot; antedates Anglo association with the area, and its derivation is uncertain. Town founder Edward C. Lasater claimed that it was a Lipan word meaning &quot;the land of heart&#x27;s delight&quot;. Others believed that it was the Spanish name for a native desert flower known as the heart&#x27;s delight. Another theory is that Falfurrias is a misspelling of one or another Spanish or French word. Still another theorizes that the name refers to a local shepherd named Don Filfarrias. The term &quot;filfarrias&quot; is Mexican slang for &quot;dirty and untidy&quot;.

==Geography==
Falfurrias is located in northeastern Brooks County at (27.226529, –98.144922). The city is centered on the intersection of U.S. Highway 281 (Future Interstate 69C) and State Highway 285. Falfurrias is about southwest of Corpus Christi, east of Laredo, north of Edinburg, and south of Alice.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==Climate==
Falfurrias has a hot, semiarid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;), bordering on a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and characterized by very hot, humid, but generally dry summers and warm, dry winters with cold mornings. During the summer, the weather is very unpleasant owing to the heat and humidity, and 12 mornings can be expected to stay at or above , with 22 mornings staying this hot in June 1998 and the hottest morning on record being on August 19 and 20 of 1915. The hottest temperature on record has been on July 13, 2016, while 26 afternoons over can be expected each year, and 146 afternoons can be expected to exceed or reach . Rain is uncommon during summer, but remnants of hurricanes sometimes produce very heavy rainfalls; on August 10 and 11, 1980, a total of fell in 48 hours, including a daily total of on August 10.

In 1937, US Highway 67 was built through the town, and after World War II saw the development of new housing.

In 1948, when the population of Bangs was 756, the arrival of senatorial candidate Lyndon Johnson by helicopter was greeted by a crowd estimated to number 700 by accompanying reporters.

<text>Brownwood is a city in and the county seat of Brown County, Texas, United States. The population was 18,862 as of the 2020 census. Brownwood is in the Texas Hill Country and is home to Howard Payne University, which was founded in 1889.

==History==

The original site of the Brown County seat of Brownwood was east of Pecan Bayou. A dispute arose over land and water rights, and the settlers were forced to find a new location. Greenleaf Fisk donated to relocate the county seat to the west side of the bayou, on what is now the current site of Brownwood, and 100 additional acres for county use. The town was incorporated in 1884.

During the Second World War, Brownwood was the location of U.S. Army Camp Bowie, which had a peak complement of over 80,000 soldiers. Camp Bowie serves as a training camp today at the intersection Farm-to-Market Roads 45 and 2126.

On April 19, 1976, an F5 tornado struck near Brownwood, causing extensive damage, with 11 reported injuries, but no fatalities.

Brownwood&#x27;s census figures were re-evaluated after the 2000 census from 18,813 to reflect more accurate figures of 20,407. The city was categorized in 2003 as a micropolitan statistical area. The federal Office of Management and Budget has issued a definition of micropolitan statistical areas as &quot;an urban cluster of at least 10,000, but less than 50,000 population, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core, as measured by commuting ties.&quot;

A dispute over water rights created the adjacent city of Early. The two cities are separated by the Pecan Bayou, one of five major tributaries of the Colorado River of Texas.

==Geography==
Brownwood is south of the center of Brown County, west of the Pecan Bayou. It is bordered to the east by the city of Early. Several U.S. Highways pass through the city. Routes 84 and 67 lead west toward Bangs and Santa Anna. U.S. Route 377 leads southwest toward Brady. All three highways head east into Early, where 67 and 377 continue northeast toward Comanche, while 84 leads southeast toward Goldthwaite. Just over the city line in Early, U.S. Route 183 leads north to Cisco and Interstate 20, the closest Interstate highway.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Brownwood has an area of , of which is land and , or 0.17%, is water.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen climate classification, Brownwood has a humid subtropical climate, &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Water bodies==
Lake Brownwood is north of the city. The lake is a reservoir created by damming the Pecan Bayou. There are a wide variety of fish in the lake: largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, white bass, striped bass, white crappie, yellow and flathead catfish, sunfish (perch), and alligator gar. Camping, waterskiing, jet skiing, and boating are available. It is home of Lake Brownwood State Park, a area that opened in 1938.

Pecan Bayou is a major tributary of the Colorado River. Due to the damming of the area to form Lake Brownwood, the bayou has a shallow depth and little flow downstream from Brownwood. During heavy rains, the bayou often floods. It runs northwest to southeast and serves as a boundary between Brownwood and Early.

Gordon Wood, who coached at Brownwood High for a quarter-century, retired in 1985 as one of the greatest coaches in Texas history, with 396 wins. He was recently surpassed by former Celina and Pilot Point coach G. A. Moore. Many athletes from surrounding communities move to Brownwood to play for the maroon and white.

==History==
In December 1847, a company of the Texas Ranger Division commanded by Henry E. McCulloch established a station at the site of present-day Burnet for the protection of frontier settlers from Indian raids. In March 1849, the station was chosen as a federal fort and named Fort Croghan.

A town was founded next to Fort Croghan in 1852, when Burnet County was established. The town was originally named Hamilton after John Hamilton, who owned a league and labor of land nearby. In August 1852, a post office was established in Hamilton and named Burnet Courthouse. In 1857, 35 residents of the town petitioned the state legislature to change the name of the town to Burnet since another town in Texas was named Hamilton; the name was changed in 1858. Major growth occurred with the arrival of the Austin and Northwestern Railroad in April 1882, when Burnet became the railhead for the area to the west. After the railroad was extended to Llano in 1892, Burnet declined as a supply point and became a farming and livestock center. The City of Burnet was incorporated in 1883.

The town&#x27;s economic growth began with the arrival of the railroad in the late 19th century, when the town became a regional shipping center for local cotton. Following the arrival of the railroad, immigrants arrived in Lockhart and opened various businesses.

Lockhart has several claims to fame. In 1999, the Texas Legislature proclaimed Lockhart the &quot;Barbecue Capital of Texas&quot;; Lockhart has four major barbecue restaurants. The Dr. Eugene Clark Library is the oldest operating public library in Texas. Lockhart was also the subject of an article by the architectural historian and critic Colin Rowe and architect John Hejduk, first published in &quot;Architectural Record&quot; in 1957 and republished in the collection of his writings &quot;As I Was Saying&quot; (1996). Rowe and Hejduk see Lockhart as a &quot;curiously eloquent&quot; example of a Victorian post-frontier American town.

Lockhart has played host to many film sets, as this quaint, small town is located just south of Austin. The 1996 Christopher Guest comedy film &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; and the 1993 drama &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape&quot; were filmed partly in Lockhart, including the historic courthouse and the town square. The city&#x27;s Walmart store was featured in the 2000 film &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;.

On July 30, 2016, a hot air balloon struck a power line and caught on fire, killing all 16 people on board when it crashed near the unincorporated community of Maxwell.
