<text>Huntsville is a city in and the county seat of Walker County, Texas, United States. The population was 45,941 as of the 2020 census. It is the center of the Huntsville micropolitan area. Huntsville is in the East Texas Piney Woods on Interstate 45 and home to Sam Houston State University, Texas State Prison, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Huntsville State Park, and HEARTS Veterans Museum of Texas.

The city served as the residence of Sam Houston, the first and third president of the Republic of Texas who later represented the state in the U.S. Senate. He is recognized in Huntsville by the Sam Houston Memorial Museum, a statue on Interstate 45, and Sam Houston State University, located in central Huntsville.

==History==
 The city got its beginning &quot;circa&quot; 1836, when Pleasant and Ephraim Gray opened a trading post on the site. Ephraim Gray became first postmaster in 1837, naming it after his hometown of Huntsville, Alabama.

Huntsville became the home of Sam Houston, who served as President of the Republic of Texas, Governor of the State of Texas, Governor of Tennessee, U.S. Senator, and Tennessee congressman. Houston led the Texas Army in the Battle of San Jacinto, the decisive victory of the Texas Revolution. He has been noted for his life among the Cherokees of Tennessee, and— near the end of his life — for his opposition to the Civil War, a very unpopular position in his day. Huntsville has two of Houston&#x27;s homes, his grave, and the Sam Houston Memorial Museum. Houston&#x27;s life in Huntsville is also commemorated by his namesake Sam Houston State University, and by a statue. (The towering statue, &quot;A Tribute to Courage&quot; by artist David Adickes, has been described as the world&#x27;s largest statue of an American hero, and is easily viewed by travelers on Interstate 45.)

Huntsville was also the home of Samuel Walker Houston (1864–1945), a prominent African-American pioneer in the field of education. He was born into slavery on February 12, 1864 to Joshua Houston, a slave owned by Sam Houston. Samuel W. Houston founded the Galilee Community School in 1907, which later became known as the Houstonian Normal and Industrial Institute, in Walker County.

In 1995, on the grounds of the old Samuel W. Houston Elementary School, the Huntsville Independent School District, along with the Huntsville Arts Commission and the high school&#x27;s Ex-Students Association, commissioned the creation of &quot;The Dreamers&quot;, a monument to underscore the black community&#x27;s contributions to the growth and development of Huntsville and Walker County.

After a book display at the Huntsville Public Library (HPL) generated a controversy among city officials in 2022, the library removed two book displays. Following the removal of the book displays, the city decided to privatize the library.

====Texas Department of Criminal Justice====
Huntsville has the headquarters of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ), the Texas agency that operates state correctional facilities for adults. The Texas prison system has been headquartered in Huntsville since Texas&#x27;s founding as a republic, and the TDCJ is the only major state agency not headquartered in Austin, the state capital.

Several TDCJ prisons for men, including the Byrd Unit, the Goree Unit, the Huntsville Unit (home of the state&#x27;s execution chamber), and the Wynne Unit, are within Huntsville&#x27;s city limits. The Holliday Unit, a transfer unit, is also in Huntsville.

The TDCJ Central Region Warehouse and Huntsville Prison Store are in the TDCJ headquarters complex. The Food Service Warehouse is behind the Wynne Unit. The TDCJ operates the Huntsville District Parole Office in Huntsville.

As of 1996 the TDCJ director resided in a mansion across the street from the Huntsville Unit.

====Other state agencies====
The headquarters of the Texas Forensic Science Commission is located at Sam Houston State University.

==Transportation==
Greyhound Lines operates the Huntsville Station in Huntsville. As of 2001 many former prisoners released from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice system use the station to travel to their final destinations. The station is three blocks uphill from the Huntsville Unit, a point of release for prisoners exiting the TDCJ.

Bruce Brothers Huntsville Regional Airport is located in Huntsville. Renamed from the Huntsville Municipal Airport in 2009, Bruce Brothers Huntsville Regional Airport is a city-owned, public-use airport.

==Culture==

In September 2009, the Huntsville Cultural District was designated by the Texas Commission on the Arts as one of the first seven state cultural districts. Museums, art galleries, artist studios and workshops, historic homes, theaters and theatrical performances are located within the Cultural District in historic Downtown Huntsville. The Cultural District is also home to some of the finest historical architecture in Texas, including murals created by world-renowned artist Richard Haas and unique homes built from recycled materials created by Dan Phillips of Phoenix Commotion complement the historic aspects of the district. 

Ruth Massingill and Ardyth Broadrick Sohn, authors of &quot;Prison City: Life with the Death Penalty in Huntsville, Texas&quot;, said that Huntsville shares several traits with other small towns. For instance many insiders include members of Huntsville&#x27;s founding families, who still reside in Huntsville. They also said &quot;Disagreement is a well-established Huntsville tradition.&quot; The authors say that debate is a significant part of the leadership agenda, and that the residents of Huntsville disagree about capital punishment.

The Huntsville Public Library opened on Sunday September 24, 1967 after the group &quot;Friends for a Huntsville Public Library&quot; had campaigned for the opening of a public library. The Huntsville Public Library provides a relevant print collection as well as offering access to electronic resources, as well as having over forty public access computers for adults, teens, and children. The Texas State library has made available a large array of professional databases, giving the public access to thousands of professional journals, encyclopedias, language programs, educational tutorials, and informational sites. Patrons of the Huntsville Public Library have access to information that was previously only available at university and major public libraries.

<text>Hempstead is a city in and the county seat of Waller County, Texas, United States. It is part of the metropolitan area.

==History==

On December 29, 1856, Richard Rodgers Peebles and James W. McDade organized the Hempstead Town Company to sell lots in the newly established community of Hempstead, which was located at the projected terminus of Houston and Texas Central Railway. Peebles named Hempstead after Dr. G. S. B. Hempstead, Peebles&#x27;s brother-in-law. Peebles and Mary Ann Groce Peebles, his wife, contributed of the estate of Jared E. Groce, Jr., for the community. On June 29, 1858, the Houston and Texas Central Railway was extended to Hempstead, causing the community to become a distribution center between the Gulf Coast and the interior of Texas. On November 10 of that year, Hempstead incorporated. The Washington County Railroad, which ran from Hempstead to Brenham, enhanced the city upon its completion.

===American Civil War and aftermath===

====1861–1862====

The Confederate Military Post of Hempstead was established in the spring of 1861. Numerous camps of instruction were established east of town along Clear Creek. Camp Hebert was established on the eastern bank of Clear Creek and south of Washington Road. Camp Hebert was the earliest camp in the area, and served as the headquarters of the Post of Hempstead early in the war.

Camp Groce CSA was established in the spring of 1862 on Liendo Plantation on the eastern bank of Clear Creek as a camp of instruction for Confederate infantry recruits. Originally named Camp Liendo, the name was changed to Camp Groce in honor of Leonard Waller Groce, the owner of Liendo Plantation, and the owner of over 100 slaves. A contract to construct the barracks at Camps Groce and Hebert was let in February 1862. Numerous Confederate infantry regiments were organized, trained, and equipped at Camps Groce and Hebert. In the spring of 1862, the camps were abandoned due to their sickness-inducing locations. Camp Groce was reused as a military camp until spring 1863, but was again abandoned. From 1861 to 1863, nearly 200 Confederate soldiers fell sick at Camps Groce and Hebert and died. Many were taken to the Post Hospital in the Planter&#x27;s Exchange Hotel located at the southwest corner of 12th and Wilkins Streets in downtown Hempstead. Many died in the hospital and almost all of them are buried on McDade Plantation west of town, which became the hospital cemetery.

====1863====

In June 1863, Camp Groce was reopened as a prison camp for Union prisoners captured in the Battles of Galveston (January 1, 1863) and Sabine Pass I (January 21, 1863). The Union prisoners of war taken at the Battle of Sabine Pass II (September 8, 1863) were also sent to Camp Groce; 427 Union prisoners were held at Camp Groce in 1863 and 21 died. Most of the dead were buried northeast of camp where most of them still rest today.

====1873====

German-American sculptor Elisabet Ney and her husband, Scottish physician and philosopher Edmund Montgomery, purchased the Liendo plantation where their family and they split time between there and their home in Austin for the next 20 years. Ney died and was buried at Liendo.

===20th century to present===

Hempstead is famous for its watermelon crop, and until the 1940s, the town was the top shipper of watermelons in the United States. Billy DiIorio was known as the Watermelon King and Angelina DiIorio was known as the Watermelon Queen. Both resided in Hempstead. The town holds an annual Watermelon Festival in July.

Hempstead is also known for its early 20th-century rough-and-tumble character. The town was informally called Six Shooter Junction.

The town has grown in recent years because of its relative closeness to Houston along U.S. Highway 290. The current economy is based on county government, shipping, and a small but growing industrial base. The town has rebounded in its population since 2010.

One of the town&#x27;s residents was Lillie E. Drennan, who in 1929 became the first woman to hold a commercial driver&#x27;s license in Texas. She ran a regional hauling company called the Drennan Truck Line while maintaining an excellent driving record. Drennan received periodic attention in national newspapers and radio broadcasts.

<text>Pyote ( ) is a town in Ward County, Texas, United States. Its population was 72 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Pyote began as a small town. Its fortunes rose with oil, but its population decreased when the railroad was built away from the town. At one time, Pyote had 3,500 residents. The 1942 development of the Pyote Army Air Base and the 1967 development of what became the West Texas State School raised the town&#x27;s fortunes.

==Geography==
Pyote is located at (31.537478, –103.126771).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.3 square miles (3.3 km2), all land.

===Climate===
This area has a large amount of sunshine year round due to its stable descending air and high pressure. According to the Köppen climate classification, Pyote has a desert climate, &quot;Bwh&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, 131 people, 56 households, and 32 families were residing in the town. The population density was 101.5 people per sq mi (39.2/km2). The 85 housing units averaged 65.9 per sq mi (25.4/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 83.97% White, 1.53% African American, 6.87% Native American, 4.58% from other races, and 3.05% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 22.90% of the population.

Of the 56 households, 26.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.4% were married couples living together, 10.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 41.1% were not families. About 37.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 12.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.34, and the average family size was 3.09.

In the town, the age distribution was 26.0% under 18, 6.1% from 18 to 24, 22.9% from 25 to 44, 26.7% from 45 to 64, and 18.3% who were 65 or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 81.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.0 males.

The median income for a household was $25,625, and for a family was $30,833. Males had a median income of $31,250 versus $20,750 for females. The per capita income for the town was $11,505. There were 6.3% of families and 15.3% of the population living below the poverty line, including 17.1% of under eighteens and 9.1% of those over 64.

==Government and infrastructure==
An unincorporated area near Pyote is the site of the former Pyote Army Air Base. It was home to the West Texas State School, a youth detention facility operated by the Texas Youth Commission, until its 2010 closure.

<text>Feodor Ingvar Kamprad (; 30 March 1926 – 27 January 2018) was a Swedish billionaire best known for founding IKEA, which he founded in 1943 and grew into a multinational retail company that became the world&#x27;s largest furniture seller in 2008. He moved to Switzerland with his Swiss wife in 1976, moving back to Småland in 2014 after her death in 2011.

==Early life and family==
Kamprad was born in Pjätteryd (now part of Älmhult Municipality), Kronobergs län, in Småland, Sweden, to Feodor Kamprad (1893–1984) and Berta Linnea Matilda Nilsson (1901–1956). His mother was of Swedish origin, while his father was born in Germany and came to Sweden a year after his birth with his parents. Kamprad&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Achim Erdmann Kamprad, was originally from an aristocratic family in Altenburger Land in Thuringia, while his paternal grandmother, Franzisca (&quot;Fanny&quot;) Glatz, was born in Radonitz (Radonice) in Bohemia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to a lower-class family. Facing rejection from his family and economic hardship in post-industrial Germany are likely what spurred Achim and Franzisca to leave their homeland and, after seeing an ad in a hunting magazine, purchase a timber estate near Agunnaryd, Sweden, where they moved with their young children in the winter of 1896. 

The surname Kamprad is a variant of &quot;Kamerade&quot; (&quot;Comrade&quot;) and dates back to the 14th century; in the 19th century the Kamprad family had become wealthy estate owners in Thuringia. Achim Kamprad&#x27;s mother was a distant relative of Paul von Hindenburg. Achim was the younger son of an estate owner and had bought the farm Elmtaryd (presently standardized &quot;Älmtaryd&quot;) near the small village of Agunnaryd (now part of Ljungby Municipality) in the province of Småland; with of land it was the largest farm in the area. He took his own life a few years after Frans Feodor was born, leaving the farm to Franzisca, and with time, to Franz Feodor. From the age of 6 onwards, Ingvar Kamprad lived on the farm with his parents, sister, and grandmother.

Kamprad visited his family&#x27;s ancestral town in Thuringia and kept in contact with relatives there.

==Career==
Kamprad began to develop a business as a young boy. He started selling matches at the age of five. When he was seven he began travelling further afield on his bicycle to peddle to neighbours. He found he could buy matches in bulk very cheaply in Stockholm, sell them individually at a low price, and still make a good profit. From matches he expanded to selling fish, Christmas tree decorations, seeds, and later ballpoint pens and pencils. When Kamprad was 17, his father gave him a cash reward for succeeding in his studies.

Ingvar attended Gothenburg&#x27;s Handelsinstitut, now part of Hvitfeldtska Gymnasiet, from 1943 to 1945. In 1943, when he was 17 Kamprad founded IKEA at his uncle Ernst&#x27;s kitchen table. In 1948, Kamprad diversified his portfolio, adding furniture. His business was mostly mail order. The acronym IKEA is made up of the initials of his name (Ingvar Kamprad) plus those of Elmtaryd, the family farm where he was born, and the nearby village Agunnaryd where he was raised. Between the founding of IKEA and his board resignation in 1946, Kamprad was an author.

In June 2013, Kamprad resigned from the board of Inter IKEA Holding SA and his youngest son Mathias Kamprad replaced Per Ludvigsson as the chairman of the holding company. Following his decision to step down the then-87-year-old founder explained, &quot;I see this as a good time for me to leave the board of Inter IKEA Group. By that we are also taking another step in the generation shift that has been ongoing for some years.&quot; Mathias and his two older brothers, who also have leadership roles at IKEA, work on the corporation&#x27;s overall vision and long-term strategy.

== Net worth and Stichting INGKA Foundation ==
The Dutch-registered Stichting INGKA Foundation is named after Ingvar Kamprad (i.e., ING + KA) which owns INGKA Holding, the parent company for all IKEA stores. Kamprad was chairman of the foundation. 

According to an article in the Swedish business weekly &quot;Veckans Affärer&quot; in 2004, Kamprad was one of the world&#x27;s wealthiest people. However, the report was based on the assumption that he owned the entire company, an approach both IKEA and the Kamprad family rejected since Kamprad retained little direct ownership in the company, having transferred his interest to the foundation.

In March 2010, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine estimated Kamprad&#x27;s fortune at US$23 billion, making him the eleventh richest person in the world. A year later, he fell to 162nd after his lawyers produced documents proving that the foundation he established and heads in Liechtenstein owns IKEA, and that its bylaws bar him and his family from benefiting from its funds. In June 2015, Kamprad was listed as the eighth wealthiest person in the world in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with an estimated net worth of $58.7 billion. Forbes reported Kamprad&#x27;s net worth as of March 2015 to be $3.5 billion.

== Works ==
While generally a private person, Kamprad published a few notable works. He first detailed his philosophies of frugality and simplicity in a manifesto entitled &quot;A Testament of a Furniture Dealer&quot; in 1976.

Kamprad also worked with Swedish journalist Bertil Torekull on &quot;Leading by Design: The IKEA Story&quot;. In the autobiographical book, Kamprad further describes his philosophies and the trials and triumphs of the founding of IKEA.

== Fascist involvement ==
In 1994, the personal letters of the Swedish fascist Per Engdahl were made public, posthumously revealing that Kamprad had joined Engdahl&#x27;s pro-fascist New Swedish Movement (&quot;Nysvenska Rörelsen&quot;) in 1942, at age 16. Kamprad had been active till as late as September 1945. When he quit the group is unknown, but he remained a friend of Engdahl until the early 1950s.

Kamprad devoted two chapters to his time in &quot;Nysvenska Rörelsen&quot; in his book &quot;Leading by Design: The IKEA Story&quot; and, in a 1994 letter to IKEA employees, called his affiliation with the organization the &quot;greatest mistake of my life&quot;. Kamprad explained his teenage engagement in New Swedish Movement as being politically influenced by his father and grandmother in Sudet-Germany.
== Personal life ==
Kamprad and his first wife Kerstin Wadling adopted a daughter, Annika in 1958. Wadling and Kamprad divorced in 1961 with Annika living with her mother.

In the 1960s, Kamprad married his second wife, Margaretha Kamprad-Stennert (1938–2011), whom he met when she was twenty years old. They had three sons: Peter, Jonas and Mathias.

He lived in Épalinges, Switzerland, from 1976 to 2014. Kamprad moved back to Småland in Sweden in March 2014 after nearly forty years away. While working with furniture manufacturers in Poland earlier in his career, Kamprad became an alcoholic. In 2004, he said that his drinking was under control, and according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Kamprad &quot;controlled it by drying out three times a year&quot;.

According to a 2006 interview, Kamprad was then driving a 1993 Volvo 240, flew economy class, and encouraged IKEA employees to use both sides of a page when writing or printing. He reportedly recycled tea bags and was known to keep the salt and pepper packets in restaurants. Kamprad had also been known to visit IKEA for a &quot;cheap meal&quot;, and was known for his frugal behaviour; purchasing wrapping paper and presents in post-Christmas sales. The company he created is still known for the attention it gives to cost control, operational details and continuous product development; allowing it to lower its prices by an average of 2–3% over the decade to 2010, while continuing its global expansion. Kamprad explains his social philosophy in his &quot;Testament of a Furniture Dealer&quot;: &quot;It is not only for cost reasons that we avoid the luxury hotels. We don&#x27;t need flashy cars, impressive titles, uniforms or other status symbols. We rely on our strength and our will!&quot; Kamprad owned a villa in Switzerland, a large country estate in Sweden and a vineyard in Provence, France. Kamprad drove a Porsche for several years.

==Death==
Kamprad died in his sleep of pneumonia at his home in Småland, Sweden, on 27 January 2018 at the age of 91. 

According to his will, half of Kamprad&#x27;s estate would go to projects in Norrland, the sparsely populated northern half of Sweden. Kamprad reportedly wanted to develop Norrland and make it possible for young people to live there. 

The other half of his estate went to his four children. In 2015, it was reported that Kamprad had named his sons as the sole heirs of an entity called the Ikano Group, which is valued at US$1.5 billion, while his adopted daughter, Annika, who lived with him for three years as an infant, was planned to receive about $300,000.

<doc id="136764" wikidata="Q815846" url="?curid=136764" title="IBM Blue Gene">
<text>Blue Gene was an IBM project aimed at designing supercomputers that can reach operating speeds in the petaFLOPS (PFLOPS) range, with relatively low power consumption.

The project created three generations of supercomputers, Blue Gene/L, Blue Gene/P, and Blue Gene/Q. During their deployment, Blue Gene systems often led the TOP500 and Green500 rankings of the most powerful and most power-efficient supercomputers, respectively. Blue Gene systems have also consistently scored top positions in the Graph500 list. The project was awarded the 2009 National Medal of Technology and Innovation.

After Blue Gene/Q, IBM focused its supercomputer efforts on the OpenPower platform, using accelerators such as FPGAs and GPUs to address the diminishing returns of Moore&#x27;s law.

==History==
A video presentation of the history and technology of the Blue Gene project was given at the Supercomputing 2020 conference.

In December 1999, IBM announced a US$100 million research initiative for a five-year effort to build a massively parallel computer, to be applied to the study of biomolecular phenomena such as protein folding. The research and development was pursued by a large multi-disciplinary team at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, initially led by William R. Pulleyblank.
The project had two main goals: to advance understanding of the mechanisms behind protein folding via large-scale simulation, and to explore novel ideas in massively parallel machine architecture and software. Major areas of investigation included: how to use this novel platform to effectively meet its scientific goals, how to make such massively parallel machines more usable, and how to achieve performance targets at a reasonable cost, through novel machine architectures.

The initial design for Blue Gene was based on an early version of the Cyclops64 architecture, designed by Monty Denneau. In parallel, Alan Gara had started working on an extension of the QCDOC architecture into a more general-purpose supercomputer. The US Department of Energy started funding the development of this system and it became known as Blue Gene/L (L for Light). Development of the original Blue Gene architecture continued under the name Blue Gene/C (C for Cyclops) and, later, Cyclops64.

Architecture and chip logic design for the Blue Gene systems was done at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, chip design was completed and chips were manufactured by IBM Microelectronics, and the systems were built at IBM Rochester, MN.

In November 2004 a 16-rack system, with each rack holding 1,024 compute nodes, achieved first place in the TOP500 list, with a LINPACK benchmarks performance of 70.72 TFLOPS. It thereby overtook NEC&#x27;s Earth Simulator, which had held the title of the fastest computer in the world since 2002. From 2004 through 2007 the Blue Gene/L installation at LLNL gradually expanded to 104 racks, achieving 478 TFLOPS Linpack and 596 TFLOPS peak. The LLNL BlueGene/L installation held the first position in the TOP500 list for 3.5 years, until in June 2008 it was overtaken by IBM&#x27;s Cell-based Roadrunner system at Los Alamos National Laboratory, which was the first system to surpass the 1 PetaFLOPS mark.

While the LLNL installation was the largest Blue Gene/L installation, many smaller installations followed. The November 2006 TOP500 list showed 27 computers with the &quot;eServer Blue Gene Solution&quot; architecture. For example, three racks of Blue Gene/L were housed at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.

While the TOP500 measures performance on a single benchmark application, Linpack, Blue Gene/L also set records for performance on a wider set of applications. Blue Gene/L was the first supercomputer ever to run over 100 TFLOPS sustained on a real-world application, namely a three-dimensional molecular dynamics code (ddcMD), simulating solidification (nucleation and growth processes) of molten metal under high pressure and temperature conditions. This achievement won the 2005 Gordon Bell Prize.

In June 2006, NNSA and IBM announced that Blue Gene/L achieved 207.3 TFLOPS on a quantum chemical application (Qbox). At Supercomputing 2006, Blue Gene/L was awarded the winning prize in all HPC Challenge Classes of awards. In 2007, a team from the IBM Almaden Research Center and the University of Nevada ran an artificial neural network almost half as complex as the brain of a mouse for the equivalent of a second (the network was run at 1/10 of normal speed for 10 seconds).

===The name ===
The name Blue Gene comes from what it was originally designed to do, help biologists understand the processes of protein folding and gene development. &quot;Blue&quot; is a traditional moniker that IBM uses for many of its products and the company itself. The original Blue Gene design was renamed &quot;Blue Gene/C&quot; and eventually Cyclops64. The &quot;L&quot; in Blue Gene/L comes from &quot;Light&quot; as that design&#x27;s original name was &quot;Blue Light&quot;. The &quot;P&quot; version was designed to be a petascale design. &quot;Q&quot; is just the letter after &quot;P&quot;.

===Major features===
The Blue Gene/L supercomputer was unique in the following aspects:
* Trading the speed of processors for lower power consumption. Blue Gene/L used low frequency and low power embedded PowerPC cores with floating-point accelerators. While the performance of each chip was relatively low, the system could achieve better power efficiency for applications that could use large numbers of nodes.
* Dual processors per node with two working modes: co-processor mode where one processor handles computation and the other handles communication; and virtual-node mode, where both processors are available to run user code, but the processors share both the computation and the communication load.
* System-on-a-chip design. Components were embedded on a single chip for each node, with the exception of 512 MB external DRAM.
* A large number of nodes (scalable in increments of 1024 up to at least 65,536).
* Three-dimensional torus interconnect with auxiliary networks for global communications (broadcast and reductions), I/O, and management.
* Lightweight OS per node for minimum system overhead (system noise).

===Architecture===
The Blue Gene/L architecture was an evolution of the QCDSP and QCDOC architectures. Each Blue Gene/L Compute or I/O node was a single ASIC with associated DRAM memory chips. The ASIC integrated two 700 MHz PowerPC 440 embedded processors, each with a double-pipeline-double-precision Floating-Point Unit (FPU), a cache sub-system with built-in DRAM controller and the logic to support multiple communication sub-systems. The dual FPUs gave each Blue Gene/L node a theoretical peak performance of 5.6 GFLOPS (gigaFLOPS). The two CPUs were not cache coherent with one another.

Compute nodes were packaged two per compute card, with 16 compute cards (thus 32 nodes) plus up to 2 I/O nodes per node board. A cabinet/rack contained 32 node boards. By the integration of all essential sub-systems on a single chip, and the use of low-power logic, each Compute or I/O node dissipated about 17 watts (including DRAMs). The low power per node allowed aggressive packaging of up to 1024 compute nodes, plus additional I/O nodes, in a standard 19-inch rack, within reasonable limits on electrical power supply and air cooling. The system performance metrics, in terms of FLOPS per watt, FLOPS per m2 of floorspace and FLOPS per unit cost, allowed scaling up to very high performance. With so many nodes, component failures were inevitable. The system was able to electrically isolate faulty components, down to a granularity of half a rack (512 compute nodes), to allow the machine to continue to run.

Each Blue Gene/L node was attached to three parallel communications networks: a 3D toroidal network for peer-to-peer communication between compute nodes, a collective network for collective communication (broadcasts and reduce operations), and a global interrupt network for fast barriers. The I/O nodes, which run the Linux operating system, provided communication to storage and external hosts via an Ethernet network. The I/O nodes handled filesystem operations on behalf of the compute nodes. A separate and private Ethernet management network provided access to any node for configuration, booting and diagnostics.

To allow multiple programs to run concurrently, a Blue Gene/L system could be partitioned into electronically isolated sets of nodes. The number of nodes in a partition had to be a positive integer power of 2, with at least 25 = 32 nodes. To run a program on Blue Gene/L, a partition of the computer was first to be reserved. The program was then loaded and run on all the nodes within the partition, and no other program could access nodes within the partition while it was in use. Upon completion, the partition nodes were released for future programs to use.

Blue Gene/L compute nodes used a minimal operating system supporting a single user program. Only a subset of POSIX calls was supported, and only one process could run at a time on a node in co-processor mode—or one process per CPU in virtual mode. Programmers needed to implement green threads in order to simulate local concurrency. Application development was usually performed in C, C++, or Fortran using MPI for communication. However, some scripting languages such as Ruby and Python have been ported to the compute nodes.

IBM published BlueMatter, the application developed to exercise Blue Gene/L, as open source. This serves to document how the torus and collective interfaces were used by applications, and may serve as a base for others to exercise the current generation of supercomputers.

==Blue Gene/P==

In June 2007, IBM unveiled Blue Gene/P, the second generation of the Blue Gene series of supercomputers and designed through a collaboration that included IBM, LLNL, and Argonne National Laboratory&#x27;s Leadership Computing Facility.

===Design===
The design of Blue Gene/P is a technology evolution from Blue Gene/L. Each Blue Gene/P Compute chip contains four PowerPC 450 processor cores, running at 850 MHz. The cores are cache coherent and the chip can operate as a 4-way symmetric multiprocessor (SMP). The memory subsystem on the chip consists of small private L2 caches, a central shared 8 MB L3 cache, and dual DDR2 memory controllers. The chip also integrates the logic for node-to-node communication, using the same network topologies as Blue Gene/L, but at more than twice the bandwidth. A compute card contains a Blue Gene/P chip with 2 or 4 GB DRAM, comprising a &quot;compute node&quot;. A single compute node has a peak performance of 13.6 GFLOPS. 32 Compute cards are plugged into an air-cooled node board. A rack contains 32 node boards (thus 1024 nodes, 4096 processor cores).
By using many small, low-power, densely packaged chips, Blue Gene/P exceeded the power efficiency of other supercomputers of its generation, and at 371 MFLOPS/W Blue Gene/P installations ranked at or near the top of the Green500 lists in 2007–2008.

===Installations===
The following is an incomplete list of Blue Gene/P installations. Per November 2009, the TOP500 list contained 15 Blue Gene/P installations of 2-racks (2048 nodes, 8192 processor cores, 23.86 TFLOPS Linpack) and larger.
* On November 12, 2007, the first Blue Gene/P installation, JUGENE, with 16 racks (16,384 nodes, 65,536 processors) was running at Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany with a performance of 167 TFLOPS. When inaugurated it was the fastest supercomputer in Europe and the sixth fastest in the world. In 2009, JUGENE was upgraded to 72 racks (73,728 nodes, 294,912 processor cores) with 144 terabytes of memory and 6 petabytes of storage, and achieved a peak performance of 1 PetaFLOPS. This configuration incorporated new air-to-water heat exchangers between the racks, reducing the cooling cost substantially. JUGENE was shut down in July 2012 and replaced by the Blue Gene/Q system JUQUEEN.
* The 40-rack (40960 nodes, 163840 processor cores) &quot;Intrepid&quot; system at Argonne National Laboratory was ranked #3 on the June 2008 Top 500 list. The Intrepid system is one of the major resources of the INCITE program, in which processor hours are awarded to &quot;grand challenge&quot; science and engineering projects in a peer-reviewed competition.

* The first Blue Gene/P in the ASEAN region was installed in 2010 at the Universiti of Brunei Darussalam’s research centre, the UBD-IBM Centre. The installation has prompted research collaboration between the university and IBM research on climate modeling that will investigate the impact of climate change on flood forecasting, crop yields, renewable energy and the health of rainforests in the region among others.
* In 2013, a 1-rack Blue Gene/P was donated to the Department of Science and Technology for weather forecasts, disaster management, precision agriculture, and health it is housed in the National Computer Center, Diliman, Quezon City, under the auspices of Philippine Genome Center (PGC) Core Facility for Bioinformatics (CFB) at UP Diliman, Quezon City.

==Blue Gene/Q==

The third design in the Blue Gene series, Blue Gene/Q, significantly expanded and enhanced on the Blue Gene/L and /P architectures.

=== Design ===
The Blue Gene/Q &quot;compute chip&quot; is based on the 64-bit IBM A2 processor core. The A2 processor core is 4-way simultaneously multithreaded and was augmented with a SIMD quad-vector double-precision floating-point unit (IBM QPX). Each Blue Gene/Q compute chip contains 18 such A2 processor cores, running at 1.6 GHz. 16 Cores are used for application computing and a 17th core is used for handling operating system assist functions such as interrupts, asynchronous I/O, MPI pacing, and RAS. The 18th core is a redundant manufacturing spare, used to increase yield. The spared-out core is disabled prior to system operation. The chip&#x27;s processor cores are linked by a crossbar switch to a 32 MB eDRAM L2 cache, operating at half core speed. The L2 cache is multi-versioned—supporting transactional memory and speculative execution—and has hardware support for atomic operations. L2 cache misses are handled by two built-in DDR3 memory controllers running at 1.33 GHz. The chip also integrates logic for chip-to-chip communications in a 5D torus configuration, with 2 GB/s chip-to-chip links. The Blue Gene/Q chip is manufactured on IBM&#x27;s copper SOI process at 45 nm. It delivers a peak performance of 204.8 GFLOPS while drawing approximately 55 watts. The chip measures 19×19 mm (359.5 mm²) and comprises 1.47 billion transistors. Completing the compute node, the chip is mounted on a compute card along with 16 GB DDR3 DRAM (i.e., 1 GB for each user processor core).

A Q32 &quot;compute drawer&quot; contains 32 compute nodes, each water cooled.
A &quot;midplane&quot; (crate) contains 16 Q32 compute drawers for a total of 512 compute nodes, electrically interconnected in a 5D torus configuration (4x4x4x4x2). Beyond the midplane level, all connections are optical. Racks have two midplanes, thus 32 compute drawers, for a total of 1024 compute nodes, 16,384 user cores, and 16 TB RAM.

Separate I/O drawers, placed at the top of a rack or in a separate rack, are air cooled and contain 8 compute cards and 8 PCIe expansion slots for InfiniBand or 10 Gigabit Ethernet networking.

=== Performance ===
At the time of the Blue Gene/Q system announcement in November 2011, an initial 4-rack Blue Gene/Q system (4096 nodes, 65536 user processor cores) achieved #17 in the TOP500 list with 677.1 TeraFLOPS Linpack, outperforming the original 2007 104-rack BlueGene/L installation described above. The same 4-rack system achieved the top position in the Graph500 list with over 250 GTEPS (giga traversed edges per second). Blue Gene/Q systems also topped the Green500 list of most energy efficient supercomputers with up to 2.1 GFLOPS/W.

In June 2012, Blue Gene/Q installations took the top positions in all three lists: TOP500, Graph500 and Green500.

=== Installations ===
The following is an incomplete list of Blue Gene/Q installations. Per June 2012, the TOP500 list contained 20 Blue Gene/Q installations of 1/2-rack (512 nodes, 8192 processor cores, 86.35 TFLOPS Linpack) and larger. At a (size-independent) power efficiency of about 2.1 GFLOPS/W, all these systems also populated the top of the June 2012 Green 500 list.

<text>Wickett is a town in Ward County, Texas, United States. The population was 422 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The following is a short history of Wickett&#x27;s beginnings.

If it had not been for George W. O&#x27;Brien, the place which was to become Wickett might have remained as Aroya, merely a switch and a section house on the Texas and Pacific Railroad, established to house one of the maintenance crews for the railroad. O&#x27;Brien gave Southern Crude&#x27;s camp (for employees), for offices, tank farm and loading racks. O&#x27;Brien furnished the land for the townsite which was to become Wickett (named for Fred H. Wickett, a chairman of the Pan American Petroleum and Transport Co., of which Southern Crude was a subsidiary).

Wickett&#x27;s official &quot;birthday&quot; was February 14, 1927; and the rush for residence and business lots in the new town was like the early days of Nevada and California. After celebrating its four-weeks anniversary on March 4, 1927, Wickett&#x27;s &quot;fathers&quot; were planning to make it the county seat of Ward County.

The new town&#x27;s early arrivals lived in crude frame shacks, in tents and under wagons. A two-story, forty-two room hotel was constructed. The Bluebonnet Refinery was built in Wickett by a group of men under the leadership of B.L. Woolley of Dallas and H.B. Hassett of St. Louis, Missouri, to process crude oil, gasoline, kerosene, diesel and other fuel oil.

Onnie Mae O&#x27;Brien became the first Postmistress on June 14, 1927, after a petition was circulated for the designation of Wickett for a U.S. Post Office.

Wickett Independent School District was created on August 20, 1928, by taking 14 sections from the Monahans District and 21 sections from the Pyote District. The Wickett School District was one of the richest of its size in the state. A two-room brick building was constructed and &quot;circa&quot; 1932, a two-room cafeteria was built. The 14 sections were returned to Monahans District in 1931.
In 1928, Bluebonnet Refinery was sold and the name was changed to Wickett Refinery Co. Gulf Oil Corporation acquired the properties of Southern Crude. The Wickett Refinery was closed in May 1973.

In 1936, a consolidation of the Wickett and Monahans schools was agreed upon because of declining enrollment. It was understood that an elementary school would remain in Wickett. On April 1, 1937, it was announced that the district was now the Monahans-Wickett Independent School District. Until 1953, the school was known as Wickett Ward School, but after the death of Mrs. Helen Gensler (a teacher), the Trustees on January 13, 1953, voted to change the name of the Helen Gensler Elementary School.
In 1937, the Cabot Companies of Boston Mass., brought a sizeable new industry to Wickett. A plant was established to extract &quot;natural gasoline&quot; and other liquid hydrocarbons which could be extracted from natural gas. In addition, a factory for the production of carbon black was constructed to claim the residue available from the burning of the &quot;dry&quot; gas. At the height of its operations, Cabot was second only to Gulf Oil as the largest private employer in Ward County. 

Although Wickett, like many West Texas communities, lost population in the 1950s and 1960s, the community was incorporated in March 1962 so that water and sewer services would be available to its residents. The first mayor was Harold Massey, son-in-law of G.W. O&#x27;Brien. Other officials were: C.W. Ross Sr., City Marshall, and councilmen were: W.O. Luckie, D.P. Fambrough, Alvie Pardue, V.C. Moore and F.E.&quot;Shorty&quot; Parker. There were 100 votes for the incorporation of Wickett and 53 votes against the incorporation.

==History==
The area surrounding Brenham was occupied by various Native American tribes through the 19th century.

In the 1820s and 1830s, several small communities developed in the area. In 1843, the Hickory Grove community was renamed Brenham in memory of a local physician, Richard Fox Brenham, who died while serving in the Texian militia during the Mier Expedition. On February 4, 1844, Washington County voters selected Brenham to become the county seat. German immigrants settled in Brenham as early as 1846. With the exception of the Civil War years, the German-born population of Brenham increased throughout the second half of the 19th century. The largest numbers of German immigrants arrived between 1880 and 1883. Jewish immigrants to Brenham established one of Texas&#x27; first Orthodox synagogues in 1885, which was relocated to Austin in 2015.

In 1999 and again in May 2006, El Cenizo gained national attention when it was widely reported that the city had Spanish as its official language. In an interview on a national cable news network held on May 23, 2006, its mayor defended the decision, but said that official business was now conducted in both English and Spanish. He also said that while he supported English as the common and unifying language of the United States, he believed that any attempt to make English the &quot;official&quot; national language would have a discriminatory effect against bilingual programs.

On May 12, 2017, following the passage of SB4, a bill in the Texas Legislature intended to crack down on sanctuary cities, El Cenizo filed a lawsuit claiming that the bill illegally commandeers local officials to enforce federal immigration law. On June 7, 2017, El Cenizo&#x27;s lawsuit was consolidated with lawsuits filed by much larger cities including San Antonio, Austin, and Dallas, with El Cenizo as the lead plaintiff.

==History==

The Spanish colonial settlement of Villa de San Agustín de Laredo was founded in 1755 by Don Tomás Sánchez de la Barrera, while the area was part of the Nuevo Santander region in the Spanish viceroyalty of New Spain. Villa de San Agustín de Laredo was named after Laredo, Cantabria, Spain and in honor of Saint Augustine of Hippo. In 1840, Laredo was the capital of the independent Republic of the Rio Grande, set up in opposition to Antonio López de Santa Anna; it was brought back into Mexico by military force.

In 1846 during the Mexican–American War, the town was occupied by the Texas Rangers. After the war, the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo ceded the land to the United States. A referendum was taken in the town, which voted to petition the American military government in charge of the area to return the town to Mexico. When this petition was rejected, many who had been in the area for generations, moved across the river into Mexican territory, where they founded Nuevo Laredo. Many others, especially original land grantees on the north side of the Rio Grande remained, becoming Texans in the process. In 1849, the United States Army set up Fort McIntosh (originally Camp Crawford). Laredo was rechartered as a city in 1852.

Laredo is one of the oldest crossing points along the Mexico–United States border, and the nation&#x27;s largest inland port of entry. In 2005, Laredo celebrated the 250th anniversary of its founding.

The etymology of the name for the Spanish town of Laredo is unclear. Some scholars say the name stems from &quot;glaretum&quot;, which means &quot;sandy, rocky place&quot;. Others state Laredo stems from a Basque word meaning &quot;beautiful pastures&quot;. Laredo might also stem from the Latin &quot;larida&quot;, which means gull.

==Economy==

South Texas banking institutions in Laredo include Falcon International Bank, International Bank of Commerce, and Texas Community Bank.

Laredo is the largest inland port in the United States, and Nuevo Laredo the largest in Latin America. This is due to their respective locations, served by Interstate Highway 35 / Mexican Federal Highway 85, the effects of NAFTA, dozens of twin assembly plants on the Mexican side, and dozens of import export agencies to expedite trade. In January 2014, the Laredo customs district processed &quot;$20 billion in two-way trade with Mexico&quot;, about half that for the entire US with Mexico for the month. Laredo is a shopping destination for Mexican shoppers from Northern Mexico. In 2015, the &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot; reported the number of Mexican shoppers has declined due to drug war-related violence in Nuevo Laredo.

===Trade===
More than 47% of United States international trade headed for Mexico and more than 36% of Mexican international trade crosses through the Laredo port of entry. Laredo&#x27;s economy revolves around commercial and industrial warehousing, import, and export. As a major player in international trade, the Laredo area benefited from passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has encouraged trade. The Laredo port of entry consists of four international bridges (with a proposed fifth one) crossing the Rio Grande into the Mexican states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo León.

===Labor market information===

As of October 2007, Laredo&#x27;s labor market was in the following industries by percentage of number employed: Trade, Transportation, and Utilities (32%), Information (1%), Financial Activity (5%), Professional and Business Services (6%), Education and Health Services (15%), Leisure and Hospitality (10%), Government (23%), Mining and Construction (5%), Manufacturing (2%), and Other Services (2%).

Laredo has increased the number of nonagricultural jobs from 55,100 in January 1996 to 86,600 in October 2007. Laredo has had a higher job growth rate (2%–6.5%) than the state as a whole because of expanded international trade through NAFTA. In 2007, Laredo experienced a job growth rate of 2.5% with the unemployment rate as of October 2007, standing at 4.1% or 3,700 unemployed persons, as compared to 3.9% in Texas statewide. This is a significant drop since the mid-1990s, when Laredo&#x27;s unemployment was over 15%.

Laredo has had positive job market growth since the mid-1990s; setbacks in the mining (oil/gas) industry shifted a few thousand workers to other industries such as international trade and construction. Many large employers in the oil and gas industries shut down operations in Laredo and across Texas, and shifted to foreign countries. The same effect occurred in the garment industry (Levis and Haggar) along the Texas border area. Laredo lost its only garment-producing company (Barry), costing the jobs of about 300 workers. Laredo&#x27;s strong job growth rate in retail and transportation services limited the adverse effects of long-term unemployment from the few massive layoffs of the late 1990s. Laredo&#x27;s success with international trade is also a vulnerability; it depends on changes to Mexico&#x27;s economy, that status of immigration laws (along with daily border crossings: shoppers and commercial trade), and terrorism.

Laredo College is a two-campus institution which offers two-year Associate&#x27;s degrees. The main campus is at the western end of downtown Laredo near the Rio Grande, on the site of the former Fort McIntosh. This fort played a major role in the development of Laredo, as it protected the community from Indian raids in its early history. Several of the old buildings at the fort were converted into classrooms, but after renovation programs nearly all of the campus structures are now modern. The smaller, newer second campus, Laredo College South Campus, is in south Laredo along U. S. Route 83.
Texas A&amp;M International University, one of the member schools of the Texas A&amp;M University System, offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees. On April 22, 2004, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board in Austin, Texas approved Texas A&amp;M International University to grant its first PhD in International Business Administration. TAMIU&#x27;s College of Business Administration has been named an outstanding business school in &quot;The Princeton Review&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Best 282 Business Schools&quot;, 2007 Edition, and ranked third in the nation for the category: &quot;Greatest Opportunity for Minority Students.&quot; The university&#x27;s campus is in Northeast Laredo along Loop 20. The university was an extension of Texas A&amp;I-Kingsville and later the former Laredo State University.

The University of Texas Health Science Center campus is in East Laredo near U.S. Highway 59 and the Laredo Medical Center. The campus is an extension university from UTHSC in San Antonio, Texas. The university offers doctoral degrees in the medical and dental fields.

===Television===
According to Nielsen Media Research, the Laredo region (which includes Webb and Zapata counties) is ranked 185th market by population size in the United States. The first station to broadcast in Laredo was KGNS in 1956, followed by KVTV in 1973, then KJTB (now KLDO) in 1985.

The only notable television network missing from Laredo&#x27;s airwaves is PBS or Cozi TV. Laredo had a full-power local The CW affiliate, KGNS-DT2, but on July 3, 2014, the affiliation switched to ABC. Prior to that KJTB channel 27, from January 1985 to October 1988 was Laredo&#x27;s ABC affiliate. KJTB was later bought by Entravision and affiliated the station to Telemundo and changed its callsign to KLDO. Today KLDO is affiliated to Univision. Before KJTB, KGNS, an NBC affiliate had a secondary affiliation to ABC from its founding in 1956 through KJTB&#x27;s founding in 1985. On November 6, 2013, KGNS reached an agreement to add the ABC affiliation. The ABC affiliate launched in July 2014 when KGNS dropped The CW programming and added ABC programming. In October 2015 KVTV now KYLX started broadcasting The CW Programming on its digital subchannel 13.2.

Laredo is served by the Laredo International Airport. Daily flights are available to Houston (George Bush Intercontinental Airport) and to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Tri-weekly flights to Las Vegas, Nevada are available. After Laredo Air Force Base closed in the mid-1970s, the federal government handed over the old air force base and property to the City of Laredo for a new municipal airport. From the mid-1970s until the mid-1990s, the airport used a small terminal for passenger airline service and several old hangars for air cargo and private aircraft. A new state-of-the art passenger terminal was built along the then newly constructed Loop 20 to accommodate larger jets and to increase passenger air travel through Laredo. Expansion of air cargo facilities, taxiways and aprons, air cargo carriers such as DHL, FedEx, UPS, BAX, and others have responded by adding commercial air cargo jet services.

<doc id="136781" wikidata="Q972709" url="?curid=136781" title="Boling-Iago, Texas">
<text>Boling-Iago ( ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Wharton County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,271 as of the 2000 United States Census. Boling-Iago is located along Farm to Market Road 1301 about southeast of Wharton, the county seat. Boling is located at the intersection of FM 1301 and Farm to Market Road 442, while the community of Iago is to the northeast at the intersection of FM 1301 and Farm to Market Road 1096. The Boling Independent School District received a Recognized ranking in 2010. The numerous pump jacks and oil tanks in the vicinity indicate that Boling and Iago lie atop oil-bearing rock formations.

Prior to the 2010 census, this CDP was split to form parts of the new Boling and Iago CDPs.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the Boling-Iago CDP has a total land area of 4.669 square miles (12.093 km) and a water area of 0.057 square miles (0.148 km).

Caney Creek meanders from northwest to southeast through the area. To the northwest of Iago, the stream can be found on the south side of Farm to Market Road 1301. Between Iago and Boling the creek crosses to the north side of the highway and loops past Boling on the north. Caney Creek eventually empties into Matagorda Bay near Sargent in Matagorda County.

The local road and property line grid is oriented to the north-northeast in the area between Iago and Wharton. Between Iago and Boling the orientation changes slightly to the northwest. About two miles south of Boling the orientation changes still more to the northeast so that it is at the same angle as the road net around Needville, Texas. FM 1301 does not conform to the road and property line grid.

FM 1301 continues to the northeast where it ends at Texas State Highway 60 in Wharton. Pledger in Matagorda County is the next community to the south at a distance of along FM 1301. Lane City is to the southwest on Farm to Market Road 442. Needville is to the northeast on FM 442. Starting from Iago Farm to Market Road 1096 goes southwest to end at FM 442. The community of Newgulf can be reached by traveling southeast on FM 1301 and northeast on County Road 190.

==History==
The first settlement in the area was known as Floyd&#x27;s Lane which was on a trail that ran from a Colorado River crossing on the west to a San Bernard River crossing on the east. A trail that ran beside Caney Creek connected the area to Wharton. Boling was founded in 1900 when the New York, Texas &amp; Mexican Railroad built a line through the area. The settlement was named for Mary Bolling Vineyard, the then-6-year-old daughter of Robert E. Vineyard who had the town surveyed. By 1907 the town had a school, a store, a blacksmith shop, and about ten families. The school had four teachers and 104 black students. These children descended from the African-American slaves who worked the area&#x27;s plantations in the pre-Civil War era. Their parents were sharecroppers or hired hands on the large land tracts which survived from the earlier time.

Boling expanded in population from 20 in 1920 to 450 in 1930 after petroleum, sulphur, and natural gas were discovered locally in mid-decade. The post office opened in 1926, dropping the second L in the town&#x27;s name to change it to Boling. The town&#x27;s streets were named after the oil companies that operated nearby. There are still streets named Atlantic, Gulf, Humble, Magnolia, Sinclair, Sun, and Texas. The Boling Chamber of Commerce was set up in 1935. The town&#x27;s population reached 800 in 1944, dipped to 521 in 1972, and increased to 1,297 in 1990. The community&#x27;s economy was hard-hit in December 1993 when the sulphur plant in Newgulf closed. In 2000 Boling&#x27;s population was 1,271.

==Demographics==
Boling-Iago first appeared as a census designated place in the 1980 U.S. Census. The CDP was split prior to the 2010 census into two separate CDPs: Boling CDP and Iago CDP.

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,271 people, 434 households, and 329 families residing in the CDP.

==Geology==
The Boling salt dome is a major geological feature in the Boling-Iago area. The large oval-shaped structure is situated mostly between Boling and the San Bernard River to the northeast, with the longer axis running east–west. The caprock lies under the surface at the crest of the salt dome. Sulphur in water wells, natural gas seeps in the San Bernard River, and surface expressions indicated that the feature might be exploited for petroleum oil. In 1922 the first lease was bought and test wells were drilled. The first commercial well was the Texas Company&#x27;s #3 Taylor in 1925; it produced about 10,000 barrels per day. In December 1937 there were 91 producing wells in the Boling Field, but by the end of 1946 many wells were played out and production dipped to 300,000 barrels per day.

In April 1947, new producing oil wells were drilled near Iago on the southwest edge of the Boling salt dome. Soon after, other successful wells were drilled on the north, northeast, and south flanks of the structure. Between 1947 and 1951, the field&#x27;s production leaped to an average of 1 million barrels per year. At the end of 1952 there were 180 oil wells. In 1927, a sulphur-rich core sample was retrieved from the caprock and the production of sulphur began. From that year until 1952, about 38 million tons of sulphur were extracted from the Boling salt dome.

==Education==

Boling-Iago is served by the Boling Independent School District. Its three schools are each located in a separate community. Boling High School is situated in Boling, Iago Junior High School can be found in Iago, and Newgulf Elementary School is located in Newgulf. In 1973, the district absorbed part of the Hungerford Independent School District. Boling High School&#x27;s sports teams are known as the Bulldogs.

In the 2010 Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) report by the Texas Education Agency (TEA), Boling ISD received a Recognized rating. According to TEA statistics, 49% of the school district&#x27;s students were Hispanic, 41% were white, and 9% were African-American. The proportion of economically disadvantaged students was 50% and the special education program served 9% of all students. While the junior high and high schools received Recognized ratings, the elementary school earned a coveted Exemplary rating in 2010. There were approximately 500 students in district schools.

The designated community college for Boling ISD is Wharton County Junior College.

==Climate==
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Boling-Iago, Texas has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<text>East Bernard is a city in Wharton County, Texas, United States. The population was 2,218 at the 2020 census. U.S. Highway 90 Alternate (US 90A) and Texas State Highway 60 (SH 60) intersect within the city limits. East Bernard has its own school district, two auto dealerships and a number of other businesses. The San Bernard River flows past the city&#x27;s eastern side.

==History==


In 2000, East Bernard incorporated. As of 2007, East Bernard is one of Texas&#x27;s newest cities.

East Bernard is on the west side of the San Bernard River at the intersection of State Highway 60 and U.S. Highway 90A, north of Wharton in northeast Wharton County. The community was originally on the east side of the river, where Jethro Spivi built the first residence &quot;circa&quot; 1850; hence the name East Bernard. Settlement was slow until 1859 and the arrival of the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway. A bridge was built, and the depot, Bernard Station, though originally located on the east bank of the river, was moved by 1869 to the west side, to the site of East Bernard&#x27;s future Main Street. The rest of the town grew up around the railway. The first post office was established in 1866, but the community was probably not officially named East Bernard until 1874.

After the Civil War, the community began to grow rapidly, as new settlers arrived with British surnames. Although Joseph Habermacher operated a store and saddle shop in Bernard Station sometime before 1867, the main influx of German and Slavic immigrants came after the 1880s. In the mid-1890s, the farming community had a population of 150, and businesses included a steam gin, a gristmill, a telegraph office, and two general stores.

The first church in East Bernard was established in 1893, when German Methodist settlers dismantled their church in Content, south of Weimar, and moved it by rail to East Bernard, where it was rebuilt in 1909. Catholic and Baptist congregations started holding services in private homes around 1900; their sanctuaries were completed between 1905 and 1907. The present Catholic church, built in 1925, has stained glass windows from Czechoslovakia, mosaics from Munich, a statue of St. Anthony from Italy, and statuary carved in the German Tyrol. An Assembly of God congregation began Pentecostal services in a private home in 1970 and moved into a new building by 1978.

East Bernard has had several newspapers, the first of which, the East Bernard Tribune, began in the 1920s. In the late 1980s, the town was served by a weekly paper with the same name. Riverside Hall, built in 1927 on the east bank of the river, became a popular dance pavilion, where Paul Whiteman was once featured. In the early years of the settlement, pioneer merchants H. P. Stockton and John G. Leveridge had operated a banking business in the back of Leveridge&#x27;s General Store; by 1907, they had organized the Union State Bank. R. B. Boettcher purchased the controlling stock in 1911. In 1960 J. R. Peace, owner of a large furniture company, helped organize a chamber of commerce, which, since East Bernard was unincorporated, performed much of the duties of a city government. In the 1980s East Bernard&#x27;s economy, though centered on agriculture, also included a gas pipeline company, a major kite-manufacturer, and several research corporations. In 1988 the population of 1,500 was served by sixty-three businesses. In 1990 the population was 1,544, and in 2000 it had grown to 1,729.

East Bernard won the Texas state football championship in 1977 and 2012.

East Bernard is widely known across the state of Texas as a volleyball powerhouse. In 2017, author Putt Riddle recorded 22 schools in Texas with at least four state championship titles in the book &quot;Above the Net - 50 Years of the Best Volleyball in Texas&quot;. The East Bernard Brahamarettes tied for the highest number of state championships, with 13 wins.

<text>Hungerford is a census-designated place (CDP) in northeastern Wharton County, Texas, United States. U.S. Route 59, Texas State Highway 60, and Farm to Market Road 1161 intersect in the community. The Kansas City Southern Railway Co. passes through Hungerford. The population was 390 at the 2020 census. It is located on what in the 1820s was part of colonist Alexander Jackson&#x27;s land grant north of George E. Quinan&#x27;s home. By the 1870s, the Quinan settlement grew up a short distance away, but its residents moved to the new town when the railroad came through Hungerford.

==Geography==
Hungerford is located at (29.399122, -96.077019).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 1.8 square miles (4.7 km2), all land.

==History==
Alexander Jackson was one of the Old Three Hundred colonists from the United States who accepted land grants from Stephen F. Austin. The Alexander Jackson league was a strip of land which was bounded on the southwest by the Colorado River, just northwest of present-day Wharton and ran northeast beyond West Bernard Creek. After the Texas Revolution, the Republic of Texas set up a short-lived ordnance depot called Post West Bernard Station at a location northwest of present-day Hungerford. Its purpose was to recondition weapons captured at the Battle of San Jacinto and to watch for a possible invasion by the Mexican army.

In 1872, the village of Quinan was founded approximately west of present-day Hungerford. The Quinan post office was established in 1874 in the general store owned by John C. Habermacher, who also served as postmaster. Habermacher was once a member of Edwin Booth&#x27;s acting troupe. His wife, Annie Thatcher, was Alexander Jackson&#x27;s granddaughter. In 1882, the New York, Texas and Mexican Railway was built through the newly surveyed town of Hungerford, which was in the adjacent George W. Singleton league. Most of Quinan&#x27;s businesses moved to the railroad, followed by the post office in 1883. The new town was named after Daniel E. Hungerford, who was the father-in-law of the railroad&#x27;s major investor, John William Mackay.

In 1885, Hungerford boasted 200 residents, several churches, a steam cotton gin, a gristmill, and a school. In 1908, the town became the headquarters for the J. D. Hudgins Ranch. In 1926, the Strouhal Tire Recapping Company opened in Hungerford. That year, the town had 13 businesses, including three general stores. Five different area schools counted a total of 259 black students, 189 white students, and 13 teachers. The 1927 poll tax enumerated 85 white voters and 64 black voters. In 1961 the population was 450 and 18 commercial establishments were in town. By that year, the train no longer stopped at Hungerford. In 1973, the local school district stopped operating and its students were absorbed by four nearby districts.

In the 1980s, there were 500 residents and most business was seasonal: hunting and harvesting cotton, grain, and pecans. In 1980, the Teen Challenge of South Texas New Life Rehabilitation Center bought the former black school. Between its opening and 1990, its enrollment increased from 150 to 250. In 2018, it was the Straightway Training Center, a Christian-based drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. In 1986, the Texas Historical Commission located four markers in Hungerford. In the late 1980s, U.S. Route 59 was rerouted to bypass Hungerford. In 2000, the population was 645.

<text>Bad Doberan () is a town in the district of Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. It was the capital of the former district of Bad Doberan. In 2012, its population was 11,427.

==Geography==
Bad Doberan is situated just west of Rostock&#x27;s city centre and is therefore part of one of the most developed regions in the north-eastern part of Germany. The town nestles between beech tree forests just 6 km from the Baltic Sea and is one of the earliest German settlements in Mecklenburg. Today the town is a very popular bathing resort, thanks to Heiligendamm, a district of Bad Doberan situated directly at the cliff line of the Baltic. Historically, Doberan used to be the summer residence for the Mecklenburg Dukes who resided in Schwerin, and for their entourage.

== Name ==
The name Doberan, originally &quot;Dobran&quot;, is a place name that probably derives from a Slavic Old Polabian personal name, meaning &quot;good&quot; (&quot;dobry&quot;).

According to legend, the name Doberan originated when the monastery was being built. It is said that a passing deer startled several swans, who shrieked with terror &quot;dobre dobre&quot;. Whereupon the monks called the place Doberan. Even today, a deer and swan adorn the arms of the town.

== History ==
=== Middle Ages ===
Bad Doberan was documented in 1177 as &quot;villa Slavica Doberan&quot;, but as early as 1171 Cistercian monks from Amelungsborn Abbey in the Weser Uplands founded a monastery in the &quot;Althof&quot; three kilometres southeast of the town, now a suburb of Bad Doberan. In 1179, these monasteries were largely destroyed in a Slavic uprising. Seven years later, the Cistercians made a second attempt to found a monastery on the site of today&#x27;s abbey. The Romanesque abbey church, dedicated in 1232, was replaced by a high Gothic church after the fire of 1291, the construction of which probably began in 1295, with the remaining parts of the Romanesque church being incorporated into the new building. The Gothic church was consecrated in 1368. The Doberan Abbey became very rich due to its economic activities is and had a large estate. Until the dissolution of the monasteries during the Reformation in 1552, it shaped the development of the village of Doberan. In addition to the monastery, there was a craftsman&#x27;s village, the &quot;Kammerhof&quot; (the old monastery farm), two pubs, a brickworks, a blacksmith and several cottagers (&quot;Kötter&quot;). It changed little after the monastery was transferred in 1552 to the sovereign. A ducal office was established in the monastery, and a mill and hunter&#x27;s lodge appeared.

=== Early Modern period ===
Doberan suffered badly in the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

The status of Doberan was considerably enhanced the 18th century when the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Frederick Francis I chose it for the recreation and entertainment of the ducal family, the Mecklenburg nobility and, later, some of the wealthy bourgeoisie too. From England it been realised that swimming in the sea was especially beneficial to health. As a result, in 1793, the duke bathed on the advice of his Rostock physician, Samuel Gottlieb Vogel, at the &quot;Heiliger Damm&quot; in the Baltic Sea, marking the birth of the first German seaside resort, Heiligendamm. The bathers stayed in Doberan and played on slot machines (the ducal resort coffers collected 30,000 thalers of royalties from Doberan&#x27;s casinos), dancing, and horse racing (probably the first horse race in Germany took place here on 10 August 1822).

=== Late Modern period ===
Renowned architects, such as Carl Theodor Severin, students of the two old masters of Classicist architecture, Carl Gotthard Langhans and Friedrich Gilly, and Johann Christoph von Seydewitz built in rapid succession in the pure Classicist style: the guest house (&quot;Logierhaus&quot;), the parlour building (&quot;Salongebäude&quot;) with its prestigious ballroom in the Empire style, the Prince&#x27;s Palace (&quot;Prinzenpalais&quot;), the &quot;Stahlbad&quot; bathing house, several town houses and the critically acclaimed Chinese-style pavilions, including the gem of garden architecture, the so-called &quot;Kamp&quot;. The prince&#x27;s gratitude to the builder who shaped the appearance of Doberan so much, was thin; Severin died in poverty and oblivion in Bad Doberan, where he is buried at an unknown location. The heyday (1793: 900, 1840, 3,000, 1870: 4,000 inhabitants) only lasted a few decades. Gradually Heiligendamm evolved, once just an appendage of Doberan&#x27;s, into an independent resort, and around Doberan it became quiet again.
Neither the granting of town rights to Doberan in 1879 (motto: Hirsch, crook and swan, are the arms of Doberan) nor the construction of the railway line from Rostock via Bad Doberan to Wismar in 1883/84, nor the establishment of a narrow gauge steam railway between 1886 and 1910 altered the situation much. The railway, known locally as &quot;Molli&quot; still runs today via Heiligendamm to Kühlungsborn, passing through the centre of the town.

The town earned the status of a resort and the prefix &quot;Bad&quot; in 1921 (&quot;Bad&quot; means &quot;spa&quot; or &quot;resort&quot; and is a common prefix in Germany).

In August 1932, Adolf Hitler was granted an honorary citizenship; Bad Doberan was the first town in Germany to do so. In fact, as the certificate was lost, there was disagreement for several years as to whether he had been granted honorary citizenship or not. However, in Spring 1932 the Nazi Party had an absolute majority in the town council assembly, and published articles still exist from that time, so it was generally accepted that Hitler was really honoured in this way. With the town hosting the G8 summit in June 2007, it was decided on April 2 that Hitler should be removed from the town&#x27;s roll of honour, although normally an honorary citizenship of this kind ends upon the death of the person involved.

On June 12, 2011, a document surfaced that most likely points to Rosenkopf as the first German town to grant Adolf Hitler honorary citizenship (July 22, 1932), not Bad Doberan.

=== Post-war period ===

From about 1965 to 1985 the large residential areas of Buchenberg, with 1,049 homes, and Kammerhof with 589 homes, were built in Plattenbau style. After the end of the GDR in 1990, the historic town centre and the monastery of Bad Doberan were thoroughly renovated as part of its urban development. In 1994, the rural district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) of Bad Doberan was formed from the districts of Bad Doberan and Rostock Land and Amt Schwaan. The rehabilitation clinic of &quot;Moorbad&quot; was opened in 1996 and the Median Clinic, Heiligendamm, in 1997. Since 2000, Bad Doberan has been a healing spa. In 2005 the new town hall was inaugurated. On 13 July 2006 the US president, George W. Bush, stayed overnight in Heiligendamm. From 6 to 8 June 2007, the G8 Summit took place in Heiligendamm, which included participation by Stephen Harper (Canada), Nicolas Sarkozy (France), Angela Merkel (Germany), Romano Prodi (Italy), Shinzō Abe (Japan), Vladimir Putin (Russia), George W. Bush (USA), Tony Blair (UK) and José Manuel Durão Barroso (EU).

== Culture and sights ==
=== General ===
The classicist buildings characterizing the centres of Bad Doberan and Heiligendamm were all built between 1801 and 1836 by the architect, Carl Theodor Severin. However, the most famous building is the Doberan Minster (&quot;Doberaner Münster&quot;, 1368), which was once the church of Doberan Abbey, and is one of the most impressive examples of Brick Gothic architecture in the Baltic Sea region. It is the most important religious sight on the European Route of Brick Gothic. The monumental grave of King Albert of Sweden can be found there.

Bad Doberan is also home to the &quot;Molli&quot;, a historic 19th century steam railway that is a tourist attraction as well as a daily commuter service in the town and to the nearby beach village.

The town hosts an annual festival celebrating the music of Frank Zappa, the Zappanale, and also displays a bust of the artist.

* In the adjacent &quot;Severinstraße&quot; is the house of the duke&#x27;s personal chef, Gaetano Medini, (No. 5), built by Severin in 1825, especially notable for its exceedingly lively, segmented facade.
* At the other end of the Kamp are the Prince&#x27;s Palace and the &quot;Gottesfrieden&quot; House opposite, which were built by Severin one after another as his residences. He had to hand over the first one to his lord.
* The Red and White Pavilions (built 1808/09 and 1810 to 1813) in the middle of the park are the only and examples of chinoiserie in Mecklenburg and initially housed a music pavilion and shopping boutiques.
* The Friderico-Francisceum, the town&#x27;s only gymnasium, is located in a building near the Kamp which was built by Möckel in 1889.

==History==
A Native American campsite was discovered approximately north of Louise on West Mustang Creek. This is the earliest known settlement near Louise. Stage Stand Creek is about east of Louise. The creek was supposedly named because the stagecoach once stopped there on its journey between Texana on the west and Egypt and Richmond on the east. A nearby location along East Mustang Creek was once known as Santa Anna&#x27;s Crossing. Originally part of Jackson County, the area became part of Wharton County in 1846. During the mid-1800s, the region had few settlers and they were mostly ranchers who let their cattle roam freely.

In 1881–82, silver mine co-owner John William Mackay constructed the New York, Texas and Mexican Railway between Rosenberg and Victoria. Italian Count Joseph Telfener recruited many of the builders, which resulted in the nickname the &quot;Macaroni Line&quot;. The railroad had six stations, one of which was named Louise after Mackay&#x27;s wife, Louise Hungerford Mackay. In 1888, there were 100 residents and the first post office was set up. G. M. Sadler and A. F. Brown soon bought the land. In June 1893, Sadler and Brown filed a plat of survey of Louise and began selling city lots and farm tracts. Their sales material called Louise &quot;the greatest country on earth&quot; and touted it as a rice-growing area.

By 1900, the railroad was owned by the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway, which was represented by its local agent D. D. Hillyard. In 1901, Sadler and partners built a water-pumping plant. Sadler built the Rice Hotel in 1901. H. P. Stockton was traveling by train, stopped to eat dinner, and found that the train left without him. He stayed overnight in Louise and decided to make it his hometown. In 1903, Sadler sold Stockton the Rice Hotel, the Peoples Bank, and the Louise Trading Company. The same year, Sadler planted of rice and made a net profit of $18,000. Soon afterward, K. H. Payne and William Thomas set up a well-drilling business and began drilling the first deep-water wells for rice irrigation found on the Texas Gulf Coast. Louise State Bank was chartered in 1905 and taken over by Peoples State Bank in 1927.

Rice was the major crop, but farmers also planted corn, cotton, and milo. A number of ethnic groups moved to the area so that the population rose to 300 in 1925. In that year, Louise boasted 25 stores, three garages, two banks, two lumberyards, and two rice warehouses. The Methodist church was constructed in 1894; it was used as a community school until 1903. The Baptist church was built in 1905. Construction of Saint Procopius Catholic Church began in 1945. Until it was built, Catholics traveled to Hillje for mass. Wildcatters began exploring for oil and gas in the 1930s and oil wells were drilled nearby. R. H. B. Hancock transported a rice mill and dryer from Port Lavaca to Louise in 1938.

The population reached a high of 900 in 1960. Louise featured a large billboard, called the &quot;Outdoor Newspaper&quot;, which got national attention. Attracted by big cities, young people began moving away so that by 1980 the population declined to 310. In 1990, the recorded population was 310 again. Fiesta Rice was a major local corporation. The 2000 census recorded 977 residents living in Louise.

Louise is home of the &quot;Brezina Boys&quot;, six brothers who all played football for the University of Houston. Greg Brezina went on to play for the Atlanta Falcons. His five brothers were Bob, Gus, Bernie, Steve, and Mark.

==Education==
Louise is served by the Louise Independent School District, which was incorporated in 1908. However, another source listed 97 students in Louise School District No. 51 in 1905–06. A 1922 photo shows four female and one male teachers. A photo of the 1926 high school senior class shows 11 females and four males. In 1927, there were 212 students and four teachers. The Louise district absorbed several surrounding school districts over time: Sandies in 1938, Adams, Carancahua, and Plainview in 1948, and Gobbler Creek in 1951. In 1990, the Louise schools counted 448 students and 36 faculty members.

<text>Wharton is a city in and the county seat of Wharton County, Texas, United States. This city is southwest of Houston. Its population was 8,832 at the 2010 census and 8,627 at the 2020 census. Wharton is located on the Colorado River of Texas. U.S. Highway 59 passes west of it.

==History==
The area now known as Wharton was part of the Caney Run mail route established in 1838 by the Republic of Texas. The community was named after two leaders in the Anglo-American struggle for Texas independence, brothers John and William Wharton. What developed as a plantation community along the Colorado River was first settled in 1846 by some of Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s original colonists. A post office was established the next year.

The first lieutenant governor of Texas, Albert Horton, was an early settler. Land for the courthouse square was donated by William Kincheloe and surveyed by Virgil Stewart and William J. E. Heard. Early settlers came from across the South: Alabama, Kentucky, Virginia, Georgia, and Mississippi.

European Jewish immigrants, arriving as early as the 1850s from Germany, established additional businesses and began the Congregation Shearith Israel, the only synagogue in a three-county area. Other settlers in the community included Swiss, German, Mexican, and Czech immigrants and, after the Civil War and emancipation, descendants of plantation slaves.

The area was first developed for agriculture, and planters used enslaved African Americans for labor before the Civil War. Early crops included potatoes, cotton, corn, rice, and sugarcane, and commercial enterprises included cattle, molasses, and sugar. At different times, the community had a cottonseed oil mill, a sugarcane factory, gristmills, cotton gins, a milk-processing plant and dairy, an ice plant, and numerous other industries. Oil and sulfur production in the outlying areas contributes to the town&#x27;s economy. The population of Wharton was approximately 200 in the early 1880s.

In 1881, the New York, Texas and Mexican Railway was the first railroad to reach Wharton. More than a decade later, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe was constructed to the town in 1899. These two railroads carried new settlers and stimulated businesses, increasing the population to 1,689 in 1900 and 2,346 in 1920. In 1888, the first opera house opened.

When Wharton was incorporated in 1902, most of the structures were of wood construction. A major fire on December 30 of that year destroyed a number of frame business buildings. Afterward, businessmen and the city government were convinced to use brick construction with fire walls for all buildings within the city limits and to construct a water system with fire hydrants.

A free library was established in 1902 by the New Century Club and adopted by the city in 1904. In 1935, the majority of the library inventory was given to the Wharton Public School. The first public park was dedicated in 1913, and the Wharton Chamber of Commerce organized in 1919.

The city had its greatest growth during the 1930s, despite the Great Depression, with the population increasing from 2,261 in 1930 to 4,386 in 1940. Wharton Little Theatre was organized in 1932, and Wharton County Junior College was established in 1946.

The town&#x27;s population reached 5,734 in 1960 and 7,881 in 1970. A community concert series was developed in the 1960s. By the 1980s, Wharton had such diverse industries as Health-focus, the largest physical rehabilitation and therapy service in the nation; M. I. Drilling Fluids, a subsidiary of Magcobar Division of Dresser Industries; the Formosa Plastics Group, consisting of Nan Ya Plastics and J-M Manufacturing; Coastal Warehouse Limited, serving the agricultural industry; and Gulf Coast Medical Center and South Texas Medical clinics. The economy was also dependent on the county government of this seat.

In the 1980s, Horton Foote, an Academy Award-winning screenwriter and a descendant of Lieutenant Governor Horton, who was born and raised in Wharton, moved back and lived in Wharton. The Wharton County Historical Museum features exhibits on notable residents - broadcast journalist Dan Rather and Medal of Honor-recipient Roy Benavidez, as well as a wildlife collection. The Wharton population was stable at the end of the 20th century: 9,033 in 1980, 9,011 in 1990, and 9,237 in 2000. The 2010 census reported a decrease to 8,832.

<text>Mobeetie is a city in northwestern Wheeler County, Texas, United States, located on Sweetwater Creek and State Highway 152. Its population was 87 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Mobeetie (formerly known as &quot;Cantonment Sweetwater&quot;) was a trading post for hunters and trappers for nearby United States Army outpost Fort Elliott. It was first a buffalo hunters&#x27; camp unofficially called &quot;Hidetown&quot;. Connected to the major cattle-drive town of Dodge City, Kansas, by the Jones-Plummer Trail, Mobeetie was a destination for stagecoach freight and buffalo skinners. As it grew, the town supported the development of cattle ranches within a hundred-mile radius by supplying the staple crops.1

The first formal name for the town was &quot;Sweetwater&quot;. It was located on the North Fork Red River, a tributary of the Red River of the South. Nearby Fort Elliott, developed to protect the buffalo trade from Indian raiders, stimulated further growth of the town. On January 24, 1876, the &quot;Sweetwater Shootout&quot; occurred. Anthony Cook (Corporal &quot;Sergeant&quot; Melvin A. King; of the then-4th Cavalry Company H, stationed at Fort Elliot) shot and killed Mollie Brennan (a dancehall girl and former prostitute). Sgt. King then wounded Bat Masterson, who in turn killed him (King may have shot Masterson first and then killed Brennan; accounts vary). Texas cattleman Charles Goodnight said about the town: &quot;I think it was the hardest place I ever saw on the frontier except Cheyenne, Wyoming.&quot;

When the town applied for a post office in 1879, the name &quot;Sweetwater&quot; was already in use. The town took the new name of &quot;Mobeetie&quot;, believed to be a Native American word for Sweetwater. It was allegedly later revealed that the word, in fact, meant &quot;buffalo dung.&quot;

Because of the presence of Fort Elliott and Mobeetie&#x27;s importance as a commercial center, Wheeler County became the first politically organized county in the Texas Panhandle, in 1879, followed by Oldham County at Tascosa, now a ghost town. Mobeetie became the first county seat for Wheeler County. From 1880 to 1883, the notorious Robert Clay Allison ranched with his two brothers, John William and Jeremiah Monroe, 12 miles northeast of town, at the junction of the Washita River and Gageby Creek. One day, Allison rode through Mobeetie drunk and naked. Allison married America Medora &quot;Dora&quot; McCulloch in Mobeetie on February 15, 1881.

At its peak in 1890, the town had over 400 people, but Mobeetie&#x27;s boom days ended when Fort Elliott closed that same year. Further decline came with the tornado of May 1, 1898, and then the loss of the county seat, in 1907, to Wheeler. In 1929, Mobeetie moved two miles when the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway built nearby tracks. The town steadily grew again until the start of World War II brought a peak around 500.

Mobeetie is also known as the birthplace of a member of the 1919 World Series champion Cincinnati Reds, infielder and catcher Morrie Rath. Rath was born on Christmas Day 1886.

==Geography== 
Mobeetie is located in the Texas Panhandle northeast of Sweetwater Creek along Texas State Highway 152, Farm to Market Road 48, and Farm to Market Road 1046. Pampa lies about 30 miles to the west, and Wheeler is about 10 miles to the east along route 152. The Fort Elliot historical site is about one mile west along SH 152.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.6 sq mi (1.6 km), all land.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, 107 people, 48 households, and 28 families were residing in the city. The population density was . The 68 housing units averaged 111.4/sq mi (43.0/km). The racial makeup of the city was 99.07% White and 0.93% Native American. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 6.54% of the population.

Of the 48 households, 27.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.0% were married couples living together, 8.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 39.6% were not families.

<text>Shamrock is a city in Wheeler County, Texas, United States. As of the 2020 Census, the city had a total population of 1,789. The city is located in the eastern portion of the Texas Panhandle, centered along the crossroads of Interstate 40 (formerly U.S. Route 66) and U.S. Route 83. It is east of Amarillo, west of Oklahoma City, and northwest of Dallas.

==History==
Located in south-central Wheeler County, Shamrock was the largest town in the county in the late 19th century. George and Dora Nickel consented to keep the first post office in their dugout there in 1890. The mail was to be carried once a week from Mobeetie, Texas. The neighbors decided to let George name the office. His Irish-American mother had told him always to depend on a shamrock to bring him good luck, so holding true to his Irish descent, he suggested &quot;Shamrock&quot; for the name of the office. When a mysterious fire destroyed his dugout, however, George Nickel&#x27;s post office never opened. Mary Ruth Jones became Shamrock&#x27;s first postmistress, running the Shamrock post office out of the Jones family home.

In 1902, the Chicago, Rock Island and Gulf Railway set up a station in the town, calling it &quot;Wheeler&quot; like the county, but later changing it back to the original name of Shamrock in 1903, which prompted the reopening of the Shamrock post office. By 1907, the town was competing with the towns of Story and Benonine as trade centers.

The town continued its growth as other businesses moved into the city, including the county newspaper, which moved from Story and renamed itself from the &quot;Wheeler County Texan&quot; to the &quot;Shamrock Texan&quot;, several banks, and Shamrock Cotton Oil Mill. In 1911, E. L. Woodley became the mayor of the newly incorporated city. In 1926, the discovery of oil and the operation of natural gas wells by Shamrock Gas Company helped spur the city&#x27;s continuing growth. A decline in the oil industry caused the population to drop in the 1940s, but it rebounded in the next decade with the improvement of Route 66. By the 1980s, the town was home to an established modern school system, a chemical plant, oil and gas processing plants, and a hospital.

At its peak in 1930, Shamrock had a population of 3,778. Despite some rebounds, the city population continues to fluctuate. According to the 2020 census, the city population has dropped to its second lowest recorded point with 1,789 residents. Despite this, Shamrock remains the second-largest city on the Texas segment of Route 66, after Amarillo.

===U-Drop Inn===

In 1936, the U-Drop Inn was built at the intersection of U.S. Route 83 and the now historic Route 66. At the time of opening, the U-Drop was the only café within of Shamrock, enjoying brisk business and becoming a successful establishment. Once considered a beautiful and impressive example of Route 66 architecture in Texas, the U-Drop Inn fell into disrepair with the decommissioning of Route 66. Referred to as &quot;one of the most impressive examples&quot; of Route 66 architecture by the Texas Historical Commission, the U-Drop Inn was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. In May 1999, the First National Bank of Shamrock purchased the then-closed U-Drop Inn and gave it to the city of Shamrock. With a $1.7 million federal grant, the city was able to hire a firm specializing in historical renovation to restore the building to its original condition and adapt it into a museum, visitors&#x27; center, gift shop, and the city&#x27;s chamber of commerce. The revived U-Drop Inn was featured in the 2006 animated film &quot;Cars&quot; as the inspiration for the fictional Ramone&#x27;s body shop.

===Pioneer West Museum===

The Old Reynolds Hotel, a historic building, was saved from demolition and converted into a museum by local residents. The building with 25 rooms was turned into an exhibition hall with pioneer artifacts, typical objects of settlers, and Native American arrowheads. The exhibits range from local historical objects to a space exhibit to a military history exhibit.

===Blarney Stone ===

A kissable chunk of Ireland&#x27;s Blarney Stone is located in Shamrock. In 1959, a local organization sent away for the stone to preserve the town&#x27;s Irish image. Irish resistance to the stone leaving its homeland led to the stone being escorted by guards and an armored truck.

===Festivals and celebrations===
Two annual social gatherings are organized each year to celebrate the founder&#x27;s heritage. The annual St. Patrick&#x27;s Celebration is held on the weekend closest to St Patrick&#x27;s Day. Irish Craftfest is held annually the first weekend of October at the Shamrock Area Community Center.

<text>Burkburnett () is a city in Wichita County, Texas, United States. It is part of the Wichita Falls, Texas metropolitan statistical area. Its population was 10,939 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Originally settled by ranchers as early as 1856, this community was known by some locals as Nesterville. By 1880, the town had a small store with a population of 132. From 1882 until 1903, a post office operated there under the designation Gilbert, named after the North Texas pioneer Mabel Gilbert. In 1906, a nearby wealthy rancher named Samuel Burk Burnett sold more than 16,000 acres (65 km) of his land in northern Wichita County to a group of investors who were seeking to extend into the wheat-growing area of Western Oklahoma the Wichita Falls and Northwestern Railway, one of the Frank Kell/Joseph A. Kemp properties based in Wichita Falls.

Within Burnett&#x27;s former land near the railroad, lots were auctioned off the following year and a post office was established. The town was named Burkburnett by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, who visited the area for a wolf hunt that was hosted by the wealthy rancher Burnett. In 1912, oil was discovered west of the town, attracting thousands to the area, and by 1918, approximately 20,000 people had settled around the oilfield. This part of the town&#x27;s history was chronicled in the film, &quot;Boom Town&quot; with Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy. The Great Depression had a negative impact on the town&#x27;s population, which was boosted again in 1941 as Sheppard Air Force Base was established nearby.

<text>Electra is a city in Wichita County, Texas, United States. It is part of the Wichita Falls metropolitan statistical area. The population was 2,292 at the 2020 census., down from 2,791 in 2010. Electra claims the title of Pump Jack Capital of Texas, a title made official by the state in 2001, and has celebrated an annual Pump Jack Festival since 2002. It was named in honor of Electra Waggoner, an heiress to the Waggoner Ranch. Electra is also known for its Grand Theatre which was refurbished and now a functioning theater.

== History ==

Daniel Waggoner started a ranch in present-day Electra in 1852. Around 30 years later, the Fort Worth and Denver Railway was built, and its railroad tracks ran through the area. In 1885, Waggoner&#x27;s son, William Thomas Waggoner, successfully lobbied railroad executives to build a railroad station at the site. By this time, the Waggoner ranch covered a half-million acres. Until this time, the town was called Waggoner, but following the building of the station and a post office in 1889, it was dubbed Beaver Switch, after the nearby Beaver Creek. The opening of of land north of the railroad station brought more farmers to the area. The town was renamed again in 1907, this time after Waggoner&#x27;s daughter, Electra Waggoner.

Water can be scarce in this region of Texas, so Waggoner started drilling for water for the town&#x27;s new residents. Most of these drilling sites were befouled by crude oil, which made the water unfit for drinking. Three years later, a developer from Fort Worth named Solomon Williams bought the land from Waggoner. Soon thereafter, he annexed nearby land, subdivided the land, and placed advertisements in national media trying to increase the population. His efforts were successful, and the town grew from a population of 500 to 1,000 between 1907 and 1910. The Waggoner family still owns much of the same land they did in the beginning and still drills for oil there.

In 1911, the Electra Independent School District was created.

On 1 April 1911, the Clayco Oil gusher brought in an oil strike at a depth of , producing 260 barrels of oil per day (BOPD). Word spread quickly, and the population increased to over 1,000, with many more oil workers commuting from Wichita Falls. The town soon had brick buildings, cement sidewalks, and a telephone exchange.

In 1936, Electra had well over 6,000 residents, but by the 1960s, the population had decreased to just over 5,000. The Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex was growing, and many people moved away. By 2000, Electra&#x27;s population had fallen to about 3,000.

<text>Wichita Falls ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Wichita County, Texas, United States. It is the principal city of the Wichita Falls metropolitan statistical area, which encompasses all of Archer, Clay, and Wichita Counties. According to the 2020 census, it had a population of 102,316, making it the 43rd-most populous city in Texas.

The city was named, in 1876, for a waterfall on the Wichita River, which was destroyed due to flooding in 1886.

==History==


The Choctaw Native Americans settled the area in the early 1800s from their native Mississippi area once Americans displaced them after the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. The treaty was signed and proclaimed in 1830–1831. As late as 1841, a large Indian settlement was present in the area that is now the city of Wichita Falls.

American settlers arrived in the 1860s, mainly as cattle ranchers. The city was named Wichita Falls on September 27, 1876, as the Wichita River runs through the area and a waterfall was in the river&#x27;s course in 1876. Just 10 years later in 1886, a flood destroyed the original waterfall on the Wichita River for which the city was named. The city built an artificial waterfall in 1987 beside the river in Lucy Park. The recreated falls are high.

On the day the city was named in 1876, a sale of town lots was held at what is now the corner of Seventh and Ohio Streets – the birthplace of the city. The Fort Worth &amp; Denver City Railway arrived in September 1882, the same year the city became the county seat of Wichita County. The city grew westwards from the original FW&amp;DC train depot which was located at the northwest corner of Seventh Street and the FW&amp;DC. This area is now referred to as the Depot Square Historic District, which has been declared a Texas Historic Landmark.

The early history of Wichita Falls well into the 20th century also rests on the work of two entrepreneurs, Joseph A. Kemp and his brother-in-law, Frank Kell. Kemp and Kell were pioneers in food processing and retailing, flour milling, railroads, cattle, banking, and oil.

The city is home to the Newby-McMahon Building (otherwise known as the &quot;world&#x27;s littlest skyscraper&quot;), constructed downtown in 1919 and featured in Robert Ripley&#x27;s &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;.

Downtown Wichita Falls was the city&#x27;s main shopping area for many years. Those shops lost ground to the creation of new shopping centers throughout the city beginning with Parker Square in 1953 and other similar developments during the 1960s and 1970s, culminating with the opening of Sikes Senter Mall in 1974. The city has been seeking funding to rebuild and restore the downtown area since 2010.

Wichita Falls was once home to offices of several oil companies and related industries, along with oil refineries operated by the Continental Oil Company (now ConocoPhillips) until 1952 and Panhandle Oil Company (founded in Wichita Falls, sold to American Petrofina in 1965). Both firms continued to use a portion of their former refineries as gasoline/oil terminal facilities for many years.

===1964 tornado===

A powerful F5 rated tornado hit the northern and northwestern portions of Wichita Falls, along with Sheppard Air Force Base during the afternoon of April 3, 1964 (later referred to as &quot;Black Friday&quot;). As the first violent tornado on record to hit the Wichita Falls area, it left seven dead and more than 100 injured. Additionally, the tornado caused roughly $15 million in property damage with about 225 homes destroyed and another 250 damaged. It was rated F5, the highest rating on the Fujita scale, but it is overshadowed by the 1979 tornado.

===1979 tornado===
An F4 tornado struck the heavily populated southern sections of Wichita Falls in the late afternoon on Tuesday, April 10, 1979 (known as &quot;Terrible Tuesday&quot;). It was part of an outbreak that produced 30 tornadoes around the region. Despite having nearly an hour&#x27;s advance warning that severe weather was imminent, 42 people were killed (including 25 in vehicles) and 1,800 were injured because it arrived just as many people were driving home from work. It left 20,000 people homeless and caused $400 million in damage, a U.S. record not topped by an individual tornado until the F5 Moore–Oklahoma City tornado of May 3, 1999.

It is one of 37 parks throughout the city. The parks range in size from small neighborhood facilities to the 258 acres of Weeks Park featuring the Champions Course at Weeks Park, an 18-hole golf course.

===Primary and secondary schools===
Public primary and secondary education is covered by the following school districts: Wichita Falls Independent School District, City View Independent School District, Burkburnett Independent School District, and Iowa Park Consolidated Independent School District. Several private and parochial schools operate in the city, as does an active home-school community. Many of the local elementary schools participate in the Head Start program for preschool-aged children.

Two schools in the Wichita Falls ISD participate in the International Baccalaureate programs. Hirschi High School offers the IB Diploma Programme, and G.H. Kirby Junior High School for the Middle Years Programme. Other public high schools are Wichita Falls High School and S. H. Rider High School (Wichita Falls ISD) and City View High School (City View ISD).

By 1879, the first school was established. The first public school was a log structure established in the 1880s; in 1885, it was replaced with a former courthouse. Wichita Falls High School opened in 1890. That year, a school district was created, but problems with the law allowing its establishment meant it was dissolved in 1894 and the city provided schooling until the second establishment of a school district in 1900.

==Transportation==

===Highways===
Wichita Falls is the western terminus for Interstate 44. U.S. Highways leading to or through Wichita Falls include 287, 277, 281, and 82. State Highway 240 ends at Wichita Falls and State Highway 79 runs through it. Wichita Falls has one of the largest freeway mileages for a city of its size as a result of a 1954 bond issue approved by city and county voters to purchase rights-of-way for several expressway routes through the city and county, the first of which was opened in the year 1958 as an alignment of U.S. 287 from Eighth Street at Broad and Holliday Streets northwestward across the Wichita River and bisecting Lucy and Scotland Parks to the Old Iowa Park Road, the original U.S. 287 alignment. That was followed by other expressway links including U.S. 82–287 east to Henrietta (completed in the year 1968), U.S. 281 south toward Jacksboro (completed 1969), U.S. 287 northwest to Iowa Park and Electra (opened 1962), Interstate 44 north to Burkburnett and the Red River (opened 1964), and Interstate 44 from Old Iowa Park Road to U.S. 287/Spur 325 interchange on the city&#x27;s north side along with Spur 325 from I-44/U.S. 287 to the main gate of Sheppard Air Force Base (both completed as a single project in 1960). However, cross-country traffic for many years had to contend with several ground-level intersections and traffic lights over Holliday and Broad Streets near the downtown area for about 13 blocks between connecting expressway links until a new elevated freeway running overhead was completed in 2001.

Efforts to create an additional freeway along the path of Kell Boulevard for U.S. 82–277 began in 1967 with the acquisition of right-of-way that included a former railroad right-of-way and the first project including construction of the present frontage roads completed in 1977, followed by freeway lanes, overpasses, and on/off ramps in 1989 from just east of Brook Avenue west to Kemp Boulevard; similar projects west from Kemp to Barnett Road in 2001 followed by Barnett Road west past FM 369 in 2010 to tie in which a project now underway to transform U.S. 277 into a continuous four-lane expressway between Wichita Falls and Abilene.

===Public transportation===
The city operates a bus system, Falls Ride, which runs on an hourly schedule with seven routes (except on Sundays, when only one route is in operation).

Greyhound Lines provides intercity bus service to other locations served by Greyhound via its new terminal at the Wichita Falls Travel Center located at Fourth and Scott in downtown. Skylark Van Service shuttles passengers to and from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on several runs during the day all week long.

The Wichita Falls Municipal Airport is served by American Eagle, with two flights daily to the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. The Kickapoo Downtown Airport and the Wichita Valley Airport serve smaller, private planes.

Although still in the planning phase, local officials are currently working to potentially bring an Amtrak stop to the city. Wichita Falls last had passenger rail service in 1967.

According to Cynthia Brown, director of UTPA&#x27;s Center for Border Economic Studies, Mexicans invested $1.4 billion into the economy and paid for 41,000 jobs[1]. In 2003, the Rio Grande Valley showed a 13.3 percent increase from 2002 sales, topping $10 billion according to a report compiled by the Rio Grande Valley Partnership/Chamber of Commerce.

<text>Georgetown is a city in Texas and the county seat of Williamson County, Texas, United States. The population was 67,176 at the 2020 census, and according to 2023 census estimates, the city is estimated to have a population of 96,312. It is north of Austin and is part of the Austin–Round Rock–San Marcos metropolitan statistical area.

Georgetown has a notable range of Victorian commercial and residential architecture. In 1976, a local historic ordinance was passed to recognize and protect the significance of the historic central business district. In 1977, the Williamson County Courthouse Historical District, containing some 46 contributing structures, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Southwestern University is the oldest university in Texas. Founded in 1875 from four existing colleges, the oldest of which had been founded 35 years earlier, it is in Georgetown about one-half mile from the historic square. Georgetown is known as the &quot;Red Poppy&quot; Capital of Texas for the red poppy wildflowers planted throughout the city. Georgetown&#x27;s Red Poppy Festival, which attracts tens of thousands of visitors annually, is held in April each year on the historic square.

==History==
===Modern history===
Georgetown was named for George Washington Glasscock, who donated the land for the new town. Early American and Swedish pioneers were attracted to the area&#x27;s abundance of timber and good, clear water. In addition, the land was inexpensive and fertile. Georgetown is the county seat of Williamson County, which was formed on March 13, 1848, after the early settlers petitioned the state legislature to create it from a portion of Milam County. The county was originally to have been named San Gabriel County, but was instead named after Robert McAlpin Williamson (known as &quot;Three-legged Willie&quot;), a Texas statesman and judge at the time.

Georgetown was an agrarian community for most of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Shawnee Trail, a cattle trail that led from Texas to the rail centers in Kansas and Missouri, crossed through Georgetown. The establishment of Southwestern University in 1873 and construction of a railroad in 1878 contributed to the town&#x27;s growth and importance. A stable economy developed, based largely on agricultural activity. Cotton was the dominant crop in the area between the 1880s and the 1920s. In this period, Williamson County was once the top producer of cotton in Texas.

At one time, Georgetown was served by two national railroads, the International-Great Northern Railroad (I-GN), which eventually was merged into the Missouri Pacific, and the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad (M-K-T). Both supported the transport of commodities to market: beef cattle and cotton. The regional Georgetown and Granger Railroad (GGR) was completed to Austin in 1904. Georgetown is served today by the Georgetown Railroad, a &#x27;short line&#x27; railroad that uses portions of the former M-K-T and the I-GN to connect with the Union Pacific Railroad at Round Rock and at Granger.

Georgetown has also been home to minor league baseball: the 1914 Georgetown Collegians began play as charter members of the Class D level Middle Texas League.

In 1921 a low-pressure system from a hurricane settled in over Williamson County and brought more than 23 inches of rain in Taylor and more than 18 inches of rain in Georgetown. The flooding resulted in the death of 156 persons, many of them farm laborers. There was also extensive property damage, and Georgetown residents sought to begin flood control.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of a dam more than 50 years later, on the north fork of the San Gabriel River, to create and impound Lake Georgetown, which opened officially on October 5, 1979. Both Georgetown and Round Rock own water rights to Lake Georgetown for municipal water use.

Population growth and industrial expansion continued modestly in the 20th century until about 1960, when residential, commercial, and industrial development, due to major growth and urban expansion of nearby Austin, greatly accelerated. In 2008, &quot;Fortune Small Business&quot; magazine ranked Georgetown as the second-best city in the nation to &quot;live and launch&quot; a new business.

In March 2015, Georgetown announced that their municipal-owned utility, Georgetown Utility Systems, would begin buying 100% of power for its customers from wind and solar farms by 2017, effectively making the city 100% green-powered.

===Klan Trials===

Between September 1923 and February 1924, District Attorney Dan Moody led a series of trials against the Ku Klux Klan at the Williamson Country Courthouse. The trials resulted in five assault convictions against members of the Ku Klux Klan for beating and tarring a white traveling salesman. The Texas Historical Commission wrote, &quot;These trials were considered the first prosecutorial success in the United States against the 1920s Klan and quickly weakened the Klan&#x27;s political influence in Texas.&quot;

===Burkland-Frisk House===

A densely overgrown, 1908–1910 Victorian house was found in Round Rock, Texas. (The site was later redeveloped for the La Frontera project.) The historic house was cut into pieces, and moved to Georgetown in 2006. There it was restored by Don Martin and Bill Smalling (1953–2008). It is located on San Gabriel Village Blvd, prominently overlooking the South San Gabriel River, and is now used as an office. It is known locally as the Burkland-Frisk House, as it was built by Leonard Frisk, an early settler in Williamson County, and was later owned by Tony Burkland, a relative.

===Historic neighborhoods===

In the 1970s, Georgetown&#x27;s downtown was bleak and featureless. In an effort to modernize and compete with suburban retail development, building owners in the 1950s and 1960s had obscured some of their historical retail buildings. The Texas-Victorian streetscape was plastered with stucco, aluminum covers, brick, and multiple layers of white paint. Community leaders began to reassess this retail stock, and work with the Main Street program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation to enhance the architectural heritage of the city.

In this period, economics also began to favor the reuse of historic buildings, as the cost of borrowing money was soaring. In Georgetown, every bank offered significantly lower interest loans for the renewal of the town&#x27;s grand Victorian buildings and facades. Rehabilitation tax credit programs in the 1980s made investing in historic property more profitable. By 1984, 40 rehabilitations were complete. Two years after Georgetown initiated its Main Street program, more than half the Main Street district had undergone some kind of positive transition.

The city was recently named one of the best places to purchase a historic house. Today, Georgetown is home to one of the best-preserved Victorian and pre-WW1 downtown historic districts, with the Beaux-Arts Williamson County Courthouse (1911) as its centerpiece. Due to its successful preservation efforts, Georgetown was named a national Main Street City in 1997, the first Texas city so designated. Georgetown has three National Register Historic Districts:
* Williamson County Courthouse Historic District
* Belford National District
* The University Avenue/Elm Street District

==Geography==
Georgetown is located at north of Austin&#x27;s central business district. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (9.22%) are covered by water.

Prior to the 2010 census, the city annexed part of the Serenada CDP, increasing its total area to , of which was land and was water-covered.

The city is located on the northeastern edge of Texas Hill Country. Portions of Georgetown are located on either side of the Balcones Escarpment, a fault line in which the areas roughly east of IH-35 are flat and characterized by having black, fertile soils of the Blackland Prairie, and the west side of the escarpment which consists mostly of hilly, karst-like terrain with little topsoil and higher elevations and which is part of the Texas Hill Country. Inner Space Cavern, a large cave, is a major tourist attraction found on the south side of the city, just west of Interstate 35, and is a large-scale example of limestone karst formations.

The North and Middle Forks of the San Gabriel River both run through the city. More than 30 miles of hike and bike trails, several parks, and recreation for both residents and visitors are provided along their banks.

;Major highways
* Interstate 35
* State Highway 29
* State Highway 195
* State Highway 130 (Toll Road)

===Endangered species===
Georgetown is home to five endangered species. Two are songbirds protected by the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve in Travis and Williamson Counties. Invertebrate species found only in Williamson County live in the cave-like fissures on the west side of Georgetown. Karst topography is the name for the honeycomb-type limestone formations (including caves, sinkholes, and fissures) that are typical in the county&#x27;s limestone geology west of I-35.

In the 1990s, a small group of concerned landowners and developers formed the Northern Edwards Aquifer Resource Council. Their goal was to identify and preserve a sufficient number of caves with endangered species to ensure survival of the species. Ultimately they wanted to obtain a United States Fish and Wildlife Service 10-A permit (known as an Incidental Take Permit) for the entire county by such actions. By gaining the permit, these species would be preserved through voluntary donations of land rather than by the county or state requiring setbacks and other involuntary means. The group documented their successful work in an environmental impact statement to the county in 2002, and a county-wide 10-A permit was obtained in October 2008.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Georgetown has a humid subtropical climate, &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

Georgetown, like much of Central Texas, is characterized by its long, hot summers and cooler, mild winters. The average summer temperature typically reaches 100 °F for several days during July and August. It is common for highs to be near 90 °F well into October, but by this time, the nights are noticeably cooler.

Winters in Georgetown have highs in the 50s and 60s, with a few days dropping near freezing, causing one or two ice storms per season. A few days reach well above the average. The region may have temperatures in the 80s well into December and 70s in January.

Fall, winter, and spring all average about two to three inches of rain per month, while July and August are the driest, averaging only one to two inches and sometimes no precipitation at all. Most of what rain does fall during the long summer comes from the outflow of Gulf storms that are often pushed away from the region by a large summer high-pressure system.

Georgetown has more than 225 days classified as mostly sunny to sunny, among a total of more than 300 days of at least partly cloudy skies per year.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census, there were 67,176 people, 28,845 households, and 18,965 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 31,265 housing units. The racial makeup of the city was 73.9% White, 4.7% African American, 0.7% Native American, 2.1% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 6.1% from some other races and 12.4% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 21.5% of the population. 19.1% of residents were under the age of 18, 4.8% were under 5 years of age, and 28.5% were 65 and older.

==Economy==
===Top employers===
According to the City&#x27;s 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the largest employers in the city are:

===Interstate Highway 35 location===

The single most important issue relating to economic development was the location of Interstate 35 through Georgetown. Originally, when first conceived, a Georgetown route was very much in doubt, as most alignments had the road going through or near Taylor. At the time, Taylor was the economic hub of Williamson County as the center for cotton and cattle. While the Taylor leadership supported the Taylor route, local farmers opposed it. The interstate required then-unheard-of wide of right of way across the entire county and through nearby Taylor farms, and many farmers worried that their homes might get cut off from their fields. Also, concerns were expressed about noise relating to cattle and other farm animals. Meanwhile, Round Rock and Georgetown leadership strongly lobbied for a route along the Balcones Escarpment fault line, which would later become U.S. Highway 81 and then eventually I-35.

===Sun City===


The second-largest economic development activity in Georgetown history was the selection in 1995 of Georgetown as the site for the first-ever Sun City location in Texas. Originally called Sun City Georgetown, the project today is called Sun City Texas due to its size and because it draws residents from all over the state. , about 15,700 people live in the massive, 4,700-acre (and expanding) community, with an average net worth over $1,000,000 per person. The economic stimulus, creation of sales tax, banking and investment, and the high rate of community support and volunteerism has had an enormous effect on Georgetown.

Opened in June 1995, Sun City Texas is a age-restricted community located in Georgetown, about 10 miles west of I-35 on Williams Drive (RM 2338). It is part of the chain of Sun City communities started by the Del E. Webb Construction Company (now a division of PulteGroup). Residency is restricted to persons over age 55 (at least one person in a couple has to be 55 or older). Sun City Texas is made up mostly of single-family dwellings, but also has duplexes. It is legal to drive golf carts on the streets in the development (under a special Texas license exemption with help from Del Webb), and most shopping and the community facilities all have special parking slots for them.

Opposition to the project has been vocal at times, especially at the start during the zoning process, with arguments against the size of the community, its effect on Georgetown as a family-oriented town, concerns about the costs of providing city utilities, concern about lowered property taxes fixed for retirees under Texas law, and the disproportionate effect of city voting.

Georgetown is considered to be one of the best places to retire in the nation because of its fairly warm climate year round, close proximity to both the countryside and Austin, excellent medical care including Alzheimer&#x27;s care, and its increasing population of retirees. In 2007, Georgetown was named by Retirement Places Rated (seventh edition) as the Best Place in America to Retire. Part of this is because Sun City Texas, a large master-planned community for &quot;active adults 55 and over&quot;, calls Georgetown home. Twenty-five years after the project groundbreaking, Sun City is now home to nearly 16,000 residents and has been a driving force behind growth, development, and the very shape of Georgetown since its inception.

Numerous other active adult communities are also found in Georgetown, including the well-respected Wesleyan at Estrella, the Oaks at Wildwood, Heritage Oaks, and many others. Various projects offer differing levels of care, including assisted living. The city, county, and churches also maintain compassionate-care facilities for the elderly at the Bluebonnet Community Residence.

===Energy policy===
Georgetown is the first Texas city to operate entirely on renewable energy. Georgetown&#x27;s projected power expenditures were $33 million for 2016 (spent $40 million); $39 million for 2017 (spent $46 million) and $45 million for 2018 (spent $53 million). It made up the shortfall through lower capital investments, rate adjustments, and &quot;higher revenue&quot; (tax). The average home power bill in the city increased 22% in 2019 compared to 2018.

==Government and politics==

===City government===
The City of Georgetown is a home rule city and adopted its initial home-rule charter on April 24, 1970. As provided by its charter, Georgetown has a council-manager form of government. Under this form of government, the city council provides leadership by establishing the city&#x27;s goals and policies. The city council appoints a full-time city manager to achieve the desired end set by the city council. The manager oversees the day-to-day activities of the city and all city departments and executes council-established laws and policies. The city council is composed of seven council members elected by geographic districts:

*District 1 – Amanda Parr
*District 2 – Shawn Hood
*District 3 – Michael Triggs
*District 4 – Steve Fought 
*District 5 – Kevin Pitts
*District 6 – Jake French
*District 7 – Tommy Gonzalez

A mayor is elected at-large. Each position is elected for a term of three years, with council districts with staggered election dates. Josh Schroeder was elected mayor in 2020 with 64.54% of the vote and reelected in May 2023 with 85.6% of the vote. He will serve until May 2026. David Morgan was hired by the City Council as the City Manager in 2015.

===State and national representation===
* Texas House of Representatives:
** State Representative District 20 – Terry Wilson (R) – elected November 2012
** State Representative District 52 – James Talarico (D) – elected November 2018
* Texas Senate
** Texas Senate District 5 – Charles Schwertner (R) – elected November 2012
* United States House of Representatives:
** Texas&#x27;s 31st congressional district – John R. Carter (R)

==Education==

The City of Georgetown is served by the Georgetown Independent School District, partially by Leander Independent School District and Georgetown High School, a National Blue Ribbon Award school, serves the community. Georgetown opened a second high school, East View High, in 2008. The graduating class of 2014 was the first class of students to graduate from East View as a full high school. Up to that point, East View High School had started as a freshman-only campus and added on one grade at a time as those students moved up.

Georgetown is the home of Southwestern University, a private, four-year, undergraduate, liberal arts college. Founded in 1875, Southwestern is the oldest university in Texas. The school is affiliated with the United Methodist Church, although the curriculum is nonsectarian. Southwestern offers 40 bachelor&#x27;s degrees in the arts, sciences, fine arts, and music, as well as interdisciplinary and pre-professional programs. The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the National Association of Schools of Music.

Hutto was established in 1855 when the International-Great Northern Railroad passed through land owned by John Hutto (1824–1914), for whom the community is named. Railroad officials designated the stop Hutto Station. James Hutto was born in Alabama on June 8, 1824; he came to Texas in 1847 and moved his family to Williamson County in 1855. A slave, Adam Orgain, was the first person to live in the immediate Hutto vicinity, having been placed out on the Blackland prairie by his owner to watch after the cattle and livestock holdings. In 1876, James Hutto sold to the Texas Land Company of New York for a town site and railroad right of way. Hutto became a wealthy cattleman in Williamson County, but in 1885, he left Hutto for Waco, and entered the hardware business. Other early settlers in the area were the Carpenter, Davis, Evans, Farley, Goodwin, Highsmith, Johnson, Magle, Payne, Saul, Weight, Womack, and Wright families. Other people living in Hutto during the 1890s included the Armstrongs, the Ahlbergs, M. B. Kennedy, the Hugh Kimbro family, William McCutcheon, Green Randolph, J. B. Ross, and the Tisdales. The area attracted Swedish and German immigrants, who established farms and ranches in Hutto.

==Mascot==
Hutto&#x27;s mascot comes from a local legend related to the International-Great Northern Railroad. The legend traces its roots back to 1915, when a circus train stopped at Hutto to pick up passengers and let the animals out to feed. One of their hippos ran loose towards Cottonwood Creek, causing the train to be delayed and other trains to be stopped. The hippo was eventually herded back onto the train.

<text>Taylor is a city in Williamson County, Texas, United States. The population at the 2020 Census was 16,267, up from 15,191 as of 2010.

==History==
In 1876, the Texas Land Company auctioned lots in anticipation of the arrival of the International-Great Northern Railroad when Taylor was founded that year. The city was named after Edward Moses Taylor, a railroad official, under the name Taylorsville, which officially became Taylor in 1892. Immigrants from Moravia and Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) and other Slavic states, as well as from Germany and Austria, helped establish the town. It soon became a busy shipping point for cattle, grain, and cotton.

By 1878, the town had 1,000 residents and 32 businesses, 29 of which were destroyed by fire in 1879. Recovery was rapid, however, and more substantial buildings were constructed. In 1882, the Taylor, Bastrop and Houston Railway (later part of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad) reached the community, and machine shops and a roundhouse served both rail lines. In 1882, the town was incorporated with a mayor-council form of city government, and in 1883, a public school system replaced a number of private schools.

By 1890, Taylor had two banks and the first savings and loan institution in Texas. An electric company, a cotton compress, and several newspapers were among the new enterprises. A water line from the San Gabriel River, a 100-man volunteer fire department, imported and local entertainment, and an annual fair made noteworthy news items by 1900.

Since 1900, Taylor&#x27;s population growth has averaged roughly 128 new residents per year, based on an estimated population of 1100 in 1900. Between 2000 and 2010, the population grew 11.9%, from 13,575 to 15,191, about 1.2% per year.

==History==
Tennessee-native Thomas Calvin Weir (1826–1901) came to Williamson County in 1856. He bought land in this area and became a prosperous farmer. Alabamian James Francis Towns (1850–1937) came in 1870 and settled nearby on the San Gabriel River. He and his brother, Robert W. Towns (1848–1938), operated a gin and blacksmith shop, as well as Towns Mill. Calvin Weir&#x27;s son Horace M. Weir was also Weir&#x27;s first Postmaster

In the late 19th century, the communities of Weir and Townsville (or Towns Mill) grew around these early settlers. Churches included Baptist and Presbyterian congregations that met at the prairie springs school, as well as an African American church that met in a school near Mankins Crossing. Calvin Weir&#x27;s daughter, Lucy, served as postmaster at the post office in Townsville, where she also ran a small store.

The communities developed similarly until 1893, when the Georgetown and Granger Railroad came through Weir, bypassing Townsville. In 1903, after the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Rail-Road (MKT) bought the line, known as the Katy, most area residents moved into the town of Weir, officially established that same year. The Katy Lake Resort, created by MKT on the river at Towns Mill Dam, attracted tourists to the area. The Townsville post office moved to Weir, and with several new businesses, the town began to thrive.

A flood in 1913 damaged the resort and several local businesses, and after a severe drought, World War I and the Great depression, Weir&#x27;s population faltered but began to prosper again in the mid-20th century. Following voter approval, Weir incorporated as a city in 1987.

Weir currently has an active fire station and one that is owned and operated by the county.

==Education==
The City of Weir is served by the Georgetown Independent School District.

<doc id="136823" wikidata="Q981537" url="?curid=136823" title="Floresville, Texas">
<text>Floresville is a city in Wilson County, Texas, United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, its population was at 7,203 at the 2020 Census. It is the county seat of Wilson County. The city is also part of the San Antonio metropolitan statistical area.

==Geography==
Floresville has a total area of , all land.

The city is approximately southeast of downtown San Antonio.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen climate classification, Floresville has a humid subtropical climate, &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==History==
Historic dwellers of the area were Lipan Apache tribes. After the Spanish discovery of the Americas, Western settlement came in the form of Christian missions. Thus, in the mid-18th century, Mision de las Cabras, &quot;the goat ranch&quot;, was established near Floresville as a mission ranching operation for Mission Espada. Indian and Spanish vaqueros lived and worshiped here, while caring for the herds of animals. This was the precursor of the Texas ranching industry.

The land and name for this town would be given to honor the Flores de Abrego family, who were descendants of the former Canary Islanders. Don Francisco Flores de Abrego was an early settler of this area, his ranch was six miles (10 km) northwest of the site of present Floresville. Four of his sons, Salvador, Manuel N., Nepomuceno, and Jose Maria served Texas in the 1835–1836 Revolution.
Don Erasmo Seguin (born 1782, in San Antonio) also settled in this area in late 1824, purchasing a ranch, and with his wife raised a family here. His ranch, &quot;Casa Blanca&quot;, began as a tract near present Floresville. The Erasmo Seguin family had previously lived in San Antonio de Bexar, and also owned a ranch further south (in present Karnes County), but now chose to build and live in Floresville.

Juan Seguín (born 1806, in San Antonio), one of Erasmo Seguin&#x27;s sons, was also a prominent Texas military and political figure. He returned with his family to again reside on his father&#x27;s Floresville ranch from 1848 to 1852. Juan then built a home in 1852 on a property adjacent to his father&#x27;s, 3 miles northwest of Floresville&#x27;s center, living there until about 1883. He had come back from a necessary self-imposed exile in Mexico, from 1842 to 1848.
As a Texian Army colonel, Juan Seguin, a true Texas Revolution (1835–1836) hero, had later been blamed by some Anglo Texans for the loss of San Antonio (then part of the Republic of Texas), from attacks by Gra. Rafael Vásquez under Gra. Santa Anna&#x27;s command in 1842, and his life was threatened. Santa Anna was trying to restore Texas to Mexican control. Though Col. Seguin had beat Gra. Vásquez&#x27;s forces back across the Rio Grande, he was disparaged as having Mexican sympathies and loyalties. In exile (from 1842), once in Mexico, he then agreed to serve under Santa Anna in the Mexican–American War of 1846–1848. Gra. Santa Anna had attempted to regain Texas from the United States in 1846, after Texas was willingly annexed by the US in 1845. After that war, Juan Seguin then left Mexico behind in 1848 and returned to the now US state of Texas, to his father&#x27;s Floresville ranch.

===2015 tornado===
In the early hours of October 30, an EF2 tornado touched down south of downtown. The tornado strengthened at a slow rate until it got to the city limits. The tornado threw a trailer on top of the Holiday Inn building. Floresville High School was severely damaged to the point where it almost collapsed. A store was pummeled by debris before the storm left the city limits. The tornado tracked into the oil fields toward Sutherland Springs. It lifted up before reaching Sutherland Springs.

<text>La Vernia is a city in Wilson County, Texas, United States. La Vernia is on the south bank of Cibolo Creek at the junction of U.S. Highway 87 and Texas Farm to Market Road 775, approximately 25 miles east of downtown San Antonio. The population was 1,077 at the 2020 census. La Vernia is part of the San Antonio Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The La Vernia area was first inhabited by the Coahuiltecan speaking peoples of Texas and subsequently by nomadic bands of Apache and Comanche who migrated to Texas in the 17th century. One of the earliest land grants made was to Erastus &quot;Deaf&quot; Smith. Smith married Guadalupe Ruiz Durán, a Mexican citizen, who was descended from one of the original Tejano or Spanish Texas families; and as such, received a land grant from the Mexican government on Cibolo Creek, north of present-day La Vernia in 1825. This area remained primarily unsettled by Europeans until 1837, when veterans from the Texas Revolution began to arrive. 
La Vernia was first settled in earnest around 1850. W. R. Wiseman of Mississippi, who organized a Presbyterian church at the site around 1851, is said to have named the place Live Oak Grove, for a grove of trees nearby.

In 1853 a post office was established under the name Post Oak. The town&#x27;s name was changed to La Vernia in 1859. The name came from the local Spanish vernacular for green oaks (Lavernia is not Spanish for green oaks). Hence, The Brahan Masonic lodge was established in 1859. The building also served as a school and church.

German and Polish immigration brought the population to 110 by 1885. The community was now served by three churches, a steam gristmill, and a cotton gin. During this time, the major crops grown were corn and cotton, which are still major crops in the area today.

In 1890, La Vernia had a population of 200. Construction of the San Antonio and Gulf Railroad across the area in 1893 brought the population to 343 by 1900. A two-teacher school was in operation by 1896. Classes grew to be so large, that they had to move out of the Masonic lodge. The enrollment had grown to sixty-six children.

By 1915, the town operated two cotton gins, a bank, four churches, a pottery plant, a brick works, and supported a population of 500. In 1947, there were seventeen businesses recorded. In 1965, population had increased to 700 residents and twenty-five businesses.

The community incorporated around 1966, and in 1990, had a population of 639 and thirty-six businesses. La Vernia experienced a population drop as people began to migrate to the larger job markets available in neighboring San Antonio, Floresville and Canyon Lake.

In 2000, La Vernia had 136 businesses and a population of 931. The census of 2005 La Vernia had a population of 1,087 of people. In 2010 a new shopping area was built just west of town on Highway 87, including a new H-E-B grocery store and gas station. A longtime grocer, Baumann&#x27;s Grocery store, closed at the time H-E-B opened.

<text>Kermit is a city in and the county seat of Winkler County, Texas, United States. The population was 6,267 at the 2020 census. The city was named after Kermit Roosevelt following a visit by his father, President Theodore Roosevelt, to the county.

==History==

===Establishment===

Kermit began as a convenient supply center for the scattered ranches of the area and became the seat of Winkler County when the county was organized in 1910. The first public school and the post office opened the same year. The town&#x27;s namesake, Kermit Roosevelt, once visited the T Bar Ranch in northern Winkler County to hunt antelope a few months before the town was named. In 1916, the county suffered a drought. Many homesteaders and ranchers were forced to leave. In 1924, only Ern Baird&#x27;s family remained in the town. Only one student attended school in the county for five months of 1924. Only three houses and the courthouse were in use by 1926.

===Discovery of oil===

On July 16, 1926, however, oil was discovered in Hendrick oilfield, near Kermit, and the town experienced a boom. In 1927, a population of 1,000 was reported; by 1929 that number increased to 1,500. On March 4, 1929, the Texas-New Mexico Railway reached the town.

===Great Depression and incorporation===

The Great Depression had little effect on the city throughout much of the 1930s, but the population decreased significantly in the early 1930s, and both population and business figures rose at the end of the 1930s, when 2,700 residents and 180 businesses were listed. On February 15, 1938, residents voted to incorporate. During the 1940s, the oil boom caused real estate prices to double. Housing was scarce, and some people lived in tents. A bank was opened by 1945. The grade school had to be enlarged, and a hospital was built.

===Oil boom days===

In the 1950s, the town continued to grow; housing additions were built. By 1960, the city had a population of 10,465 and 260 businesses, and additional growth estimated to be over 12,000 during the decade. Flooding became a problem because of the flat terrain, so new crown streets were constructed to solve the flooding problem, and more housing additions were built. The town moved the last working wooden derrick in the Permian Basin from Loving County to Pioneer Park in Kermit in 1966 as a symbol of the importance of the oil industry to the economy of Kermit and Winkler County. In the 1970s and 1980s, the population of Kermit bounced between 8,500 and 6,912, and the number of businesses moved between 200 and 116. Improvements were made in city services, and more housing additions were built.

On June 3, 1980, a 9-ft-wide (3 m) sinkhole opened on the property of Atlantic Richfield Company and got progressively larger. Within four days, it had become a tourist attraction, with a crater measuring , and as much as deep. The 1990 United States census set the population of Kermit at 6,875.

==Geography==
Kermit is located at (31.853995, 103.092336). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The city is located in a semiarid region of the Permian Basin.

===Climate===
This area has a large amount of sunshine year round due to its stable descending air and high pressure. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Kermit has a hot arid climate, &quot;BWh&quot; on climate maps, slightly too warm to be a cool arid climate (&quot;BWk&quot;) and slightly too dry for semi-arid classification.

<text>Wink is a city in Winkler County, Texas, United States. The population was 915 at the 2020 census. Wink was a temporary childhood home to singer and songwriter Roy Orbison, although he was born in Vernon, Texas. Orbison later described the major components of life in Wink as &quot;football, oil fields, oil, grease and sand&quot;, and in later years expressed relief that he was able to leave the desolate town.

==History==
Wink began in 1926, when oil was discovered in Hendrick oilfield in Winkler County. By mid-1927, the Wink Townsite Company was selling lots in Horse Wells pasture of the T. G. Hendrick Ranch. The oil boom brought new people to Wink, causing a shortage of housing. Newcomers set up tents and built makeshift houses. Wink was originally named Winkler, Texas, for the county. When a post office was requested, postal authorities notified the applicant that a post office bearing that name already was in operation. The citizens shortened the name to Wink and received a post office in 1927. In that year, the first public school was organized, and a temporary building was constructed. A Sunday school was started by November 1927, and the population of the town was reported at 3,500. By 1929, that number climbed to 6,000. The actual population could have been around 10,000 to 25,000 people.

The boom brought lawlessness to Wink, including bootlegging, prostitution, and gambling. Even the city government, which was organized on June 4, 1928, came under the control of a well-organized underworld. On October 16, 1928, District Judge Charles Klapproth declared the incorporation election void, and the city government was reorganized. In December 1928, the first municipal building, a jail, was constructed. In 1929, the Texas-New Mexico Railroad built its tracks from Wink Junction to Wink, connecting the town to Monahans and New Mexico.

In the 1930s, the boom declined; the population hovered under 4,000, and the number of businesses fluctuated between 50 and 180. By 1933, the town was legally incorporated. Five hospitals and 15 doctors served injured oilfield workers, expectant mothers, and epidemic victims. Throughout the 1940s, the population continued to decline from 1,945 to 1,521, and the number of businesses decreased from 130 to 40.

In December 1947, Winkler County State Bank opened in Wink. Wink entered the 1950s with a stable community, including a population just over 1,500. The number of businesses varied in the decade from 25 to 50. In 1958, the railroad from Wink Junction to Wink was abandoned. During the early 1960s, the population rose to over 1,800, but dipped to under 1,200. By 1968, the number of businesses varied between 55 and 20.

In July 1960, the federal government approved an application by Wink for more than a million dollars in urban renewal funds to upgrade and rehabilitate within the city limits of Wink. National attention focused on the small oil town, which used the money for paving and curb and gutter work.

The population continued to decline to under 1,200 in the 1970s and 1980s. In the late 1970s, the oil economy improved, but the number of businesses slipped to a low of five by the late 1980s. At the end of the 1980s, Wink operated on a limited budget, based on low tax rates. In 1990, Wink remained a small oil town with a population of 1,189. This had fallen to 919 by 2000, but the 2010 count indicated a slight rebound, with 940 citizens residing in Wink. By 2020, the population had fallen to 915.

<doc id="136833" wikidata="Q913776" url="?curid=136833" title="Bridgeport, Texas">
<text>Bridgeport is a city in Wise County, Texas, United States. The population was 5,923 in 2020. In 2009, Bridgeport was named by the Texas Legislature as the Stagecoach Capital of Texas.

==History==
Bridgeport&#x27;s history began in February 1860 when William H. Hunt was granted a charter from the West Fork Bridge Company to build a bridge across the West Fork of the Trinity River. The bridge was located approximately one mile southwest of the present townsite. A Texas State Historical Marker alongside Farm To Market Road 920 denotes the spot of the original bridge today.

The wooden bridge was used for a portion of the Butterfield Overland Mail stage route used for only a few months between August 1860 and March 1861. After the American Civil War began, the mail route was no longer used and the original wooden bridge was abandoned, deteriorated and collapsed into the river.

In 1873 a new iron bridge was built and a post office established, thus formally creating the city of Bridgeport, TX. Its future was assured in 1882 when Charles Cates discovered a vein of bituminous coal while drilling for water. The Wise County Coal Company was formed and was a leading producer of coal for the state until competition from natural gas and petroleum closed the coal mines in 1929.

A catholic congregation was served by Rev. J.J O&#x27;Riordan from Henrietta, the first Catholic Church in Wise County, the St. John the Baptizer Catholic Church was constructed in 1926.

In 1893 the Rock Island Railroad established a line east of the town, so the town moved approximately one mile east to its present site. In 1913 the town was incorporated. Gas and Oil production became a local industry prior to 1917. The 1920s census showed a town of 1,872. During the 1920s, limestone quarries that produced aggregate for road construction and a brick factory were established. In 1931, a dam was constructed approximately three miles west of town on the West Fork of the Trinity River, creating Lake Bridgeport. The lake was a local center for recreation and remains so today.

During the latter half of the 20th century, Bridgeport&#x27;s oil, gas, and limestone industries continued to flourish and the town became the second largest town in Wise County. These industries continue to be the local economic leaders.

==Geography==
 According to the United States Census Bureau, Bridgeport has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Bridgeport has a humid subtropical climate, &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==


As of the 2020 United States census, there were 5,923 people, 1,777 households, and 1,322 families residing in the city.

==Education==
Bridgeport is served by the Bridgeport Independent School District.

==Recreation==
Lake Bridgeport is located west of the city and offers recreational boating and watersports, as well as freshwater fishing. Bridgeport Falls is also located to the south, on the West Fork of the Trinity River.

The City operates Northwest OHV Park on the north of the city limits. This is a 300-acre park for motorcycles, ATVs, UTVs, and Jeeps to roam over trails through varied terrain.
==Banking==
For almost 100 years, Bridgeport was served by the First National Bank of Bridgeport. The bank was purchased in the late 1900s by primary investors Billie C. Green, W.W. &quot;Wilson&quot; Ray, and M.L. Manoushagian. It, however, was sold in December 2005 to First Financial Bank (Texas) (stock symbol FFIN) based in Abilene and became part of a six branch bank consisting of institutions in Bridgeport, Boyd, Decatur, Keller, and Trophy Club.

The Community Bank opened the doors for business in June 2007. It is the only locally owned and independently operated bank in Bridgeport, Texas. Every year, the bank donates thousands of dollars and numerous hours of community service to the school district and local charities.
The Community Bank is guided by officers Theresa East, Jamie Cook and Joe Murphy.

<doc id="136835" wikidata="Q674049" url="?curid=136835" title="Decatur, Texas">
<text>Decatur is the county seat of Wise County, Texas, United States. Its population was 6,538 in 2020.

==History==
Wise County was established in 1856, and Taylorsville (in honor of Zachary Taylor) was made the county seat.

Absalom Bishop, an early settler and member of the Texas Legislature, opposed naming the town after a Whig Party member, and in 1858, arranged to have the name changed to Decatur, in honor of naval hero Stephen Decatur.

In 1857, a post office was opened, and the first school was established in 1857. In the early 1860s, a courthouse was erected.

===Civil War===

Early settlers to northern Texas came from a variety of eastern states, with about half coming from the &quot;Deep South&quot;. Most of the rest came from the Upper South, and a number sympathized with the Unionist side at the outset of the Civil War. Cooke County and others voted against secession in this part of the state. Violence against Unionists by Confederate troops and militia was common, especially after the Confederate legislature passed an unpopular conscription law.

In October 1862, several Unionist sympathizers from Decatur were arrested by Confederate troops and taken to nearby Gainesville, the Cooke County seat, for trial on charges of treason and insurrection. About 150–200 suspects were arrested by Confederate troops. A &quot;Citizens Court&quot; was pulled together by local colonels, although it had no standing in state law. It quickly convicted seven men, who were executed by hanging. Mob pressure against the court arose, and it turned over 14 suspects, who were lynched - and executed by hanging without any judicial process. Nineteen men who had been acquitted were returned to the court, and a new jury convicted them without any new evidence, sentencing them to death. They were also hanged. Another two men were shot trying to escape. In all, 42 men were killed in Gainesville in these actions.

North Texas was in chaos, with dissenting citizens at risk from military forces. A few weeks later, more suspected Unionist supporters were hanged without trial in several North Texas communities. Five were lynched in Decatur, under the supervision of Confederate Capt. John Hale. The Great Hanging at Gainesville is believed to have been the largest single incident of vigilante violence in U.S. history.

===After the Civil War===
By the late 1860s, several stores and a hotel had been established. In 1882, the Fort Worth and Denver Railway reached the town, and Decatur was added to the Butterfield Overland mail route.

In 1881, the Wise County Old Settlers Reunion held their first meeting. This has become an annual tradition in Decatur, and the reunion continues to take place during the last full week of July.

Decatur Baptist College (now Dallas Baptist University) was established in Decatur in 1898. It was the first two-year institution of higher education in Texas. In 1965, the college moved to Dallas to be in a larger population center. The former Administration Building then housed the Wise County Heritage Museum. The building was destroyed in a fire in 2023. It is one of five sites in Decatur listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Wise County Courthouse was designed by James Riely Gordon, the master architect of Texas courthouses. Completed in 1896, the building is an example of Gordon&#x27;s Signature Plan. He used corner entrances (making for short halls) to draw in the breeze, which was pulled up through a central atrium like a chimney, providing excellent air circulation. The exterior is Texas red granite (like the Capitol) with terra cotta ornamentation. The almost pyramidal mass refers to 1,000-year-old churches in the south of France. The building has been praised, with its &quot;sister&quot; courthouse in Waxahachie, as &quot;the zenith of Gordon&#x27;s Richardsonian Romanesque work&quot;. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Another historic building found on the east side of the city is the Texas Tourist Camp, dating back to 1927.

In 1962, Eddie Wayne Hill, lead guitarist for Tommy &amp; the Tom Toms, and drummer Joel Colbert, were killed when their convertible collided head-on with a gravel truck on State Highway 114 south of Decatur. Country singer Charley Pride was more fortunate, surviving a mid-air crash with another plane over Decatur in 1980, though two people died in the crash.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The highest point of elevation in the county is the courthouse site. As with ancient hill towns in Europe, the frontier settlement was developed on high ground for defensive purposes, so European settlers could see and ward off attacks or raids, in this case by Native Americans.

<text>Mineola is a city in the U.S. state of Texas in Wood County. It lies 26 miles north of Tyler. Its population was 4,823 at the 2020 census.

The town was incorporated as the railroads arrived in 1873. A railroad official, Ira H. Evans, combined the names of his daughter, Ola, and her friend, Minnie Patten, to create the city name Mineola.

==History==
Mineola came into existence when the railroads built lines through the eastern part of the state. In 1873, the Texas and Pacific and the International-Great Northern raced to see which could get to Mineola first. The I-GN reached the finish 15 minutes earlier. A city government was organized in 1873, a post office opened in 1875, and the town was incorporated in 1877, but a fire in the 1880s destroyed 18 buildings. The town&#x27;s oldest paper, the &quot;Mineola Monitor&quot;, was founded in 1876. By 1890, the town had seven churches, several schools including a black free school, hotels, banks. In 1895, Mineola became the site of the Wood County Fair.

Since Mineola was in the heart of the East Texas timber belt, timber was plentiful for making railroad ties and lumber. Mineola provided most of the ties to complete the T&amp;P RR west to El Paso in 1879; S. Zuckerman, a Mineola resident, filled contracts for 85,000 ties that were used in the construction. During the community&#x27;s first 60 years, farm products included cotton, livestock, fruit, and berries. A chair factory opened in 1886, became a crate and basket factory in 1900, and operated until 1952. Highway improvement, the Magnolia Pipeline Company gas line, and the establishment of a railroad terminal caused growth during the 1920s, and the discovery of oil in parts of Wood County and construction of a T&amp;P railroad shop spurred the economy during the 1940s. Diversified farming gave way to cattle raising and watermelon crops by 1950. The Mineola Watermelon Festival began in 1948. Subsequently, sweet-potato farming, a creamery, a nursery, and a company that supplies poles and pulpwood to the telephone company helped the economy.

The town remains a shipping center. The Mineola Memorial Library, largely financed by H. W. Meredith, was completed in 1960. Nearby Lake Holbrook, also completed in 1962, attracts residents and visitors. The Meredith Foundation has provided large sums for educational and cultural purposes since 1962. Meredith Hall Civic Center, completed in 1977, is used by large and small groups for varied events. The manufacture of women&#x27;s clothing, sporting goods, electronic connectors, fertilizer, and cattle feed, and the packaging of dry beans and meat provide employment for many people. The Wood County Airport, north of Mineola, was completed in 1984. A new city hall complex was completed in 1986, and a two-school facility was completed in 1987.

In 2023, Max aired &quot;How to Create a Sex Scandal&quot;, a three-part documentary about charges of child sexual abuse that allegedly took place in Mineola in 2005.

The library&#x27;s first building was in a frame house offered by the Liles family located at the corner of Main and Lane Streets near the courthouse square.
In August 1980, a financial drive began to purchase a larger building to house the many books that had been collected from donations. The community supported the drive, and the former facility of the First National Bank, at 202 East Goode Street, Quitman, was purchased. In early 1987, a local fundraising effort was started for additional space in the library to accommodate a children&#x27;s department, a staff book-processing area, and a community meeting room. The library received several grants, and in October 1988, the Thurman Shamburger Wing was dedicated.

Today, the Quitman Public Library is fully staffed and houses a collection of nearly 30,000 items in a variety of formats; the library also houses the collection of the Wood County Genealogical Society. The library has an advisory board and active Friends of the Library group.

<text>Graham is the county seat of and largest city in Young County. As of the 2020 U.S. Census, it has a population of 8,732.

==History==
The site was first settled in 1871 by brothers Gustavus A. and Edwin S. Graham, primary shareholders in the Texas Emigration and Land Company of Louisville, Kentucky. The brothers moved to Texas after the Civil War, and after buying in then-vast Young County, helped to revitalize the area, the population of which had become badly depleted during the war. During that same year as when Graham was settled, the Warren Wagon Train Raid occurred about 12 miles north of the city. In 1872, the Graham brothers purchased a local saltworks, established the town of Graham, and set up the Graham Land Office. The saltworks were not a profitable venture, as the salt was too expensive to ship, and were closed in a few years.

New families started to arrive, and the brothers began promoting the sale of homesites and doing civic improvements. A post office opened in 1873, and after Young County reorganized the following year, Graham became the county seat. The town&#x27;s newspaper, known as &quot;The Graham Leader&quot; and still in existence today, was first printed in 1876, the same year that the first temporary courthouse was built. Other businesses from these early years included a gristmill, sawmill, cotton gin, and brick kiln, two hotels, and several stores.

On February 15, 1877, the city was the site of the organizational meeting of the group that became the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, created to police ranching and put a stop to cattle rustling. Founding officers included pioneer ranchers James C. Loving (son of Oliver Loving), Col. C. L. (Kit) Carter, and C.C. Slaughter. A three-story limestone courthouse was built in 1884, and it was replaced by a new courthouse in the early 1930s. The 1884 structure&#x27;s east door still stands on the courthouse square. From 1879 to 1896, Graham was the seat of a federal district court overseen by Judge A.P. McCormick; his jurisdiction extended over all of Texas north and west to New Mexico.

Edwin Graham had married Addie Mary Kintner in 1865. They had five children. Throughout the 1870s, they divided their time between Texas and their families back north, but in 1879, with the town flourishing, they moved their wives and children to Graham permanently. Edwin and Addie lived there until 1891, then moved to Spokane, Washington, where Edwin died on May 7, 1899. His body was brought back to Graham for burial. Addie moved back to Graham and became a leading civic booster and philanthropist. In 1921, with her son Malcolm, she set up the Graham Foundation as a continuing fund for the city&#x27;s growth and improvement. Addie died in 1929; she was responsible for the establishment of the Eden Home for the aged.

By 1900, Graham had incorporated as a town, and railroad service began in 1903, through the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Texas Railroad, part of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific system. In 1921, the Wichita Falls and Southern Railroad, one of the Frank Kell and Joseph A. Kemp properties, extended its line into Graham from Newcastle. The WF&amp;S was abandoned in 1954 and the Rock Island sold its line to the Texas Export Railroad in 1972, but was abandoned just two years later.

The population of Graham grew slowly until 1917, when oil was discovered nearby; the population tripled from 878 in 1900 to 2,544 in 1920. By 1966, Graham had 17 churches, seven schools, a hospital, a radio station, two libraries, three parks, and two newspapers. The population peaked at 9,170 in 1980, and has since gradually declined; it was 8,716 at the 2000 census and 8,518 by the July 2007 estimate.

==Geography==
Graham, the county seat of Young County, is located in the southeast portion of the county, and has an area of 5.592 sq mi (14.48 km2). Geographically, Graham is located in the western Cross Timbers area of North Texas. Locally, this is known as the western portion of the Palo Pinto Mountains.

Creeks drain the area generally into the Brazos River; Dry Creek on the eastern side of town flows into Salt Creek towards the south and into the Brazos. Flatrock Creek drains the rural areas to the southeast and also flows into the Brazos just below where Salt Creek enters. Small impoundments located along Flatrock Creek are used for stock tanks and fish ponds.

==History==
The development of the area began c. 1747 when Col. José de Escandón began bringing colonists to establish permanent settlements along Mexico&#x27;s northern frontier, when parcels of land were granted to the colonists by the Spanish government. In 1767 Ysabel María Sánchez, widow of early settler and rancher Joseph López, was allotted more than 6000 acres. The village of Lopeño, later developed on this land, was named after the López family.

During the early 1800s, part of the López land passed to the ownership of the Ramírez family founders of the nearby village of Falcón. In 1821, Benito Ramírez built a combination home, fort, and chapel that came to be Fort Lopeño. Federal troops briefly occupied the fort during 1856 to ease border disturbances.

A general store, established in the early 1900s by Serafín Benavides, served as the area&#x27;s only supply point at the time. A post office was established in 1920 and in 1934 oil and gas were drilled in the area.

<text>San Ygnacio is a census-designated place (CDP) in Zapata County, Texas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the CDP population was 504. It is named for the prominent Spanish saint, Ignatius of Loyola. The portion of the community between the Rio Grande and U.S. Highway 83 is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as San Ygnacio Historic District.

==History==

San Ygnacio, originally a Mexican pueblo, was founded in 1830 by settlers from nearby Guerrero, Tamaulipas on the outskirts of the recently established Uribeno Ranch. Frequent Comanche attacks in the early days of San Ygnacio necessitated the use of defensive stone architecture which has endowed the present area with uncharacteristically enduring historical sites from that period.

San Ygnacio is also historically notable for its involvement in the short-lived revolution of the Rio Grande Republic, which was established at meetings which were convened in the town in 1839.

San Ygnacio played an important role in the Garza Revolution from 1891 to 1893. Multiple small battles were fought near the town in both Mexican and American territory.

San Ygnacio was attacked in June 1916 by either Mexican Carrancistas or Seditionists. On June 10, approximately 100 Mexicans fought a losing battle with about 150 American soldiers from the 14th Cavalry.

San Ygnacio was the site of the filming of the 1952 film &quot;Viva Zapata&quot;.

Although many of San Ygnacio&#x27;s neighboring municipalities were evacuated and consolidated in the deliberate 1953 flooding of the region which created Falcon Lake and &quot;New&quot; Zapata, San Ygnacio&#x27;s residents petitioned for the right to remain on their land, which was high enough to escape substantial damage. Having survived, its architectural heritage was acknowledged in 1972 when it was added to the National Register of Historic Places, being the last standing collection of Mexican Ranch vernacular architecture, representing the 19th century settlement of the lower Rio Grande valley. Its oldest building is now a National Historic Landmark, the Treviño-Uribe Rancho, built 1830.

The private River Pierce Foundation works to continue the restoration of the San Ygnacio Historic District.

<text>Crystal City is a city in and the county seat of Zavala County, Texas, United States. The population was 6,354 as of the 2020 census. It was settled as a farming and ranching community and was a major railroad stop being from San Antonio. Spinach became a major crop and the city has promoted itself as &quot;Spinach Capital of the World.&quot; During World War II, a large internment camp was located here. The town is also noteworthy in the history of Mexican American political self-determination for the founding of the La Raza Unida Party.

==History==

===Farming, ranching, railroad===
Crystal City was originally settled by American farmers and ranchers producing cattle and various crops.

The successful production of spinach evolved into a dominant industry. By March 26, 1937, the growers had erected a statue of the cartoon character Popeye in the town because his reliance on spinach for strength led to greater popularity for the vegetable, which had become a staple cash crop of the local economy. Early in its history, the area known as the &quot;Winter Garden District&quot; was deemed the &quot;Spinach Capital of the World&quot; (a title contested by Alma, Arkansas). The first Spinach Festival was held in 1936. It was put on hold during World War II and later years. The festival resumed in 1982. The Spinach Festival is traditionally held on the second weekend in November, and draws former residents (many of them former migrant farm workers) from Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, California, Washington, and beyond.

===Internment camp===

During World War II, Crystal City was home to a World War II internment camp which housed American civilians of German, Japanese, and Italian ancestry.
===Political activism===
With the stream of refugees fleeing the Mexican Revolution of 1910, and later added to by Mexican migrant workers lured by the local spinach industry, the demographics of the small rural city began to shift over the years since its 1910 incorporation, due to its proximity to the U.S./Mexico border. 

In 1962, Mexican-Americans began to register to vote and were harassed by local police, employers, and especially the Texas Rangers. The Rangers used a range of intimidation tactics, including physical violence/threats and preventing the formation of voter rallies. Several lawsuits resulted, drawing significant press attention. In 1963, the swiftly emerging Mexican-American majority elected an all-Mexican-American city council, led by Juan Cornejo, a local representative of the Teamsters Union at the Del Monte cannery in Crystal City. The newly elected city council, and the succeeding administration, had trouble governing the city because of political factions among the new officials. Cornejo was appointed mayor from among the five new council members. His quest to control the city government eventually led to his loss of political support. Although these five elected officials known as &quot;Los Cinco&quot; only held office for two years, many consider this moment the &quot;spark&quot; or starting point of what became known as the Chicano movement. A new group made up of both Anglos and Mexican Americans, the Citizens Association Serving All Americans, announced its plans to run candidates for countywide offices in 1964, and won.

In 1969, it was no longer allowed for Mexican Americans to speak Spanish in school, and there were no more classes or lessons on Mexican history, culture, or literature, even though Mexican Americans were the majority in Crystal City.

===Chicano School Walkouts===
Mexican Americans were, and continue to comprise, the majority of the population of Crystal City. In the late 1960s, over half of these were migrant farmers who would take their children out of school in the spring and sometimes would not return from the migrant circuit until the fall semester had already begun. During the summer interim, government officials and school board members would pass rules and regulations to maintain control of the absentee population. However, not just in these positions of power was the lack of Mexican Americans noticeable. A faculty committee of the local high school ruled that only one Mexican American cheerleader was allowed and the rest had to be Anglo. In the 1969 school year, students were outraged when two cheerleading spots became vacant but Mexican American students were not considered to fill the spots because one Mexican American cheerleader was already on the team. That year, the school board also required that any candidate for cheerleader had to have at least one parent who graduated from the high school. When Mexican American students complained to the superintendent, a new rule was created that stated that there were to be three Mexican American cheerleaders and three Anglo cheerleaders. The Anglo parents complained that the superintendent was &quot;caving in&quot; to the Mexican American students, which resulted in the school board nullifying the superintendent&#x27;s solution and creating a new resolution stating that any future unrest among the students would be met with expulsion.

Student leaders took their concerns to the school board, who refused to hear their demands, which included the &quot;hiring of more Hispanic teachers and counselors; more classes to challenge students and fewer shop and home economics electives; bilingual-bicultural education at the elementary and secondary levels; Mexican American studies classes to reflect the contributions made by Latinos; and the edition of a student representative to the school board.&quot;

After the school board refused to hear their demands, the students staged a walkout on December 9, 1969. Eventually the number of students walking the picket line exceeded 2,000. When elementary and junior high students began to join the walkout, the Texas Education Agency (TEA) sent negotiators in an attempt to get the students back in school. The TEA recommended closing schools early for the Christmas holidays, but the school board nixed this idea.

Texas Senator Ralph Yarborough invited three student leaders to come to Washington, DC, to discuss discrimination in their schools. These students also met with Senators Edward Kennedy and George McGovern, who notified the Civil Rights division of the Department of Justice and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare of the situation. Texans for the Educational Advancement of Mexican Americans (TEAMA) taught the striking students during the Christmas holidays.

The school board finally agreed to a hearing, and on January 9, 1970, student demands were approved. This victory galvanized the community and that spring, &quot;Mexican American candidates swept the school board and city council elections.&quot;

Within two years, the faculty of the school, as well as administrators and the superintendent, reflected the Mexican American majority of the population. The school had an increase in graduating students; a majority were enrolling in some form of higher education. Some of the student leaders of the walkout later held key positions at the school and in government.

===La Raza Unida Party===
By the late 1960s, Crystal City became the location of continued activism in the civil rights movement among its Mexican American majority population, and the birthplace of the third-party political movement known as La Raza Unida Party founded by three Chicanos, including José Ángel Gutiérrez over a conflict about the ethnicity of cheerleaders at Crystal City High School. La Raza Unida, and related organizations, then won election to most offices in Crystal City and Zavala County in the periods between 1969 and 1980, when the party declined at the local level.

In the 1970s, following protests of charges (essentially nonpayment of services) on the part of La Raza Unida, Crystal City&#x27;s natural gas supply was shut off by its only supplier. Crystal City residents resorted to mostly wood-burning stoves and individual propane gas tanks for cooking.

===1976 indictments===
In 1976, 11 officials in Crystal City were indicted on various counts. Angel Noe Gonzalez, the former Crystal City Independent School District superintendent who later worked in the United States Department of Education in Washington, DC, upon his indictment retained the San Antonio lawyer and later mayor, Phil Hardberger. Gonzalez was charged with paying Adan Cantu for doing no work. Hardberger, however, documented to the court specific duties that Cantu had performed and disputed all the witnesses called against Cantu. The jury unanimously acquitted Gonzalez. Many newspapers reported on the indictments, but not on the acquittal. John Luke Hill, the 1978 Democratic gubernatorial nominee, had sought to weaken La Raza Unida so that he would not lose general election votes to a third-party candidate. Victory, however, went not to Hill, but narrowly to his successful Republican rival, Bill Clements. Compean received only 15,000 votes, or 0.6%, just under Clements&#x27;s 17,000-vote plurality over Hill.

===Political corruption===
In February 2016, almost every top official of the city was arrested under a federal indictment accusing them of taking bribes from contractors and providing city workers to assist an illegal gambling operator, Ngoc Tri Nguyen. Included were Mayor Ricardo Lopez, city attorney William Jonas, Mayor &quot;pro tem&quot; Rogelio Mata, council member Roel Mata, and former council member Gilbert Urrabazo. A second councilman, Marco Rodriguez, was already charged in a separate case with smuggling Mexican immigrants. A week earlier, Lopez was taken into custody for assault and disorderly conduct during a city council meeting in which a recall election to remove two other city council members and him was discussed. In December, Jonas surrendered to authorities after being charged with assault for allegedly manhandling an elderly woman who was trying to enter a city council meeting. That left one councilman free of federal charges.

<text>Beaver is a city in, and county seat of, Beaver County in southwestern Utah, United States. The population was 3,592 at the 2020 census, up from the 2010 figure of 3,112.

==History==
Indigenous peoples lived in the area for thousands of years, as demonstrated by archeological evidence. A number of identified prehistoric sites have been found in Beaver County, dating to the Archaic and Sevier Fremont periods. A prehistoric obsidian quarry site has been identified in the nearby Mineral Mountains.

The historic Southern Paiute inhabited the region well before encountering the first European explorers. The 1776 Dominguez–Escalante Expedition is the first known European exploration in this area. 

In 1847–1848, Mormons from the United States developed a trade route through the Beaver River valley between their new settlements at Salt Lake City in the Utah Territory and Los Angeles, which was still part of Alta California, Mexico. The original route crossed the river three miles downstream from Beaver at the site that later was developed as Greenville. This route became known during the California Gold Rush as the Southern Route of the California Trail. Later called the Mormon Road or California Road, it passed over the Black Mountains between the crossing and Muley Point. Following the United States&#x27; victory in the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), it took over California and the Southwest.

In 1855, as part of improvements, the Mormon Road over the Black Mountains was realigned eastward. It was routed from the site that developed as Beaver to Muley Point through more wagon-friendly terrain in Nevershine Hollow and over Beaver Ridge into the canyon of Fremont Wash, rejoining the original road above Muley Point. This road became a winter commercial wagon road, known in California as the Los Angeles – Salt Lake Road, and in Mormon settlements in Utah and Arizona Territory (now southern Nevada) as the California Road.

Beaver was settled in 1856 by Mormon pioneers traveling this road; it was one of a string of Mormon settlements along the road through Utah. By design, these settlements were located a day&#x27;s ride on horseback apart, which explains the regularity of their spacing. They were generally apart. Where intervening settlements failed or were absorbed, they became apart. Beaver was developed between the settlements in the Pahvant Valley and those in the Parowan Valley.

In 1873 the US Army established Fort Cameron, two miles from Beaver, because of Indian raids on the area Mormon settlements. To serve this isolated area, the territorial government placed the Second Judicial Court of the Utah Territory in Beaver from 1870 until 1896, when Utah became a state. Also included in this court&#x27;s jurisdiction were Iron, Washington, Kane, Garfield, and Piute counties. 

In 1856, Mormons migrated to the Beaver Valley from Parowan to the south. George A. Smith called a council meeting in February 1856, and Simeon F. Howd was elected as presiding elder and Edward W. Thompson as clerk. In 1858, numerous migrants from San Bernardino, California, settled here. In December 1859, W. W. Willis and P. K. Smith were authorized by the council to build a sawmill and gristmill on North Creek, and given control of all water on the mill site. By 1869, the Mormon settlers in Beaver were numerous enough to organize a stake. The first stake president was John Murdock.

During the 1870s, settlers made an effort to establish a woolen mill, a tannery, and a dairy industry. Most were engaged in stock raising.

Beaver was the first town in Utah to be electrified. A hydroelectric generation plant was constructed on the Beaver River early in the 20th century. The plant continues to provide a large part of Beaver&#x27;s power requirements today. Although, contrary to popular belief, it is not locally referred to as &quot;Beaver Dam!&quot;

In 2006, Beaver won a contest for best tasting rural water in the United States. In 2010, Beaver took top honors in the world for best tasting water. Its welcome billboards along I-15 highlight the water quality.

==Geography==
Beaver is located in eastern Beaver County, along Interstate 15, the main artery for the state. To the east of Beaver lie the Tushar Mountains. The peaks in these mountains rise to over . The Beaver River flows out of the mountains and through the city of Beaver, passing south of downtown before continuing west towards Minersville and the Escalante Desert basin. The Mineral Mountains rise to the west of Beaver, and the South Hills are to the south.

Interstate 15 runs along the western edge of Beaver, with access from exits 109 and 112. I-15 leads north to the western end of Interstate 70 at Cove Fort, to Fillmore, and to Salt Lake City and south to Cedar City, to St George, and to Las Vegas. Utah State Route 153 heads east from Beaver across the Tushar Mountains to Junction, and Utah State Route 21 runs west through the Beaver River Valley to Minersville.

The American Discovery Trail runs through Beaver.
An important Beaver landmark is the hillside letter B, which is visible from the freeway ().

During the summer, days are hot and usually dry, though on occasions, as in July 1936 – the wettest month on record with – monsoonal weather can bring heavy thunderstorms from the Gulf of California.

Winters are cold, though not severe, and generally dry, with the city&#x27;s intermountain valley location making it sufficiently dry that only of snowfall can be expected each winter. Typically temperatures fall below freezing on all but six nights during winter and on 193.7 nights during an entire year; however maxima will top freezing on all but 14.3 afternoons. Temperatures below occur on 9.8 nights per winter, and the coldest temperature on record is on February 9, 1933, during an exceptionally cold western winter. The most snowfall has been at least between July 1948 and June 1949, and the most in a month during the notoriously cold January 1949 which averaged a record low with mean minimum as low as ; by way of contrast, no measurable snow fell during the mild, dry winter of 1962–63.
