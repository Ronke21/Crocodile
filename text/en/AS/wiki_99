<doc id="136870" wikidata="Q482976" url="?curid=136870" title="Brigham City, Utah">
<text>Brigham City is a city in Box Elder County, Utah, United States. The population was 19,650 at the 2020 census, up from the 2010 figure of 17,899. It is the county seat of Box Elder County. It lies on the western slope of the Wellsville Mountains, a branch of the Wasatch Range at the western terminus of Box Elder Canyon. It is near the former headquarters of ATK Thiokol, now Northrop Grumman, the company that created the solid rocket boosters for the Space Shuttle.

Brigham City is known for its peaches and holds an annual celebration called Peach Days on the weekend after Labor Day. Much of Main Street is closed off to cars, and the festival is celebrated by a parade, a car show, a carnival, and other activities. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) dedicated its fourteenth temple in Utah in Brigham City on September 23, 2012. Brigham City is home to the Golden Spike State Historical Monument and one of the nine regional campuses of Utah State University.

The city is the headquarters of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation, a federally recognized tribe of Shoshone people.

==History==
Latter-Day Saint pioneer William Davis first explored the Brigham City area in 1850. He returned with his family and others a year later to create permanent homes. Brigham Young directed Lorenzo Snow to lead additional settlers to the site and foster a self-sufficient city at the site in 1853.
Snow directed both religious and political affairs in the settlement, eventually naming it Box Elder in 1855. When the town was incorporated on January 12, 1867, the name was changed to Brigham City in honor of Brigham Young. That same month, after the Utah legislature authorized a municipal election, residents elected Chester Loveland to be the town&#x27;s first mayor. Brigham Young gave his last public sermon there in 1877 shortly before his death. In 1864, the cooperative movement began in earnest with the creation of a mercantile co-op store and was an important element of the United Order. Other industries were added, and the Brigham City Co-op is widely recognized as the most successful of the Latter-Day Saint Co-op ventures. Economic hardships brought an end to the Co-op in 1895, though the Co-op had first started selling businesses off in 1876.

World War II brought a major economic boost to the city. The federal government created Bushnell General Hospital on Brigham City&#x27;s south side to treat soldiers wounded in the war. Locals sold supplies and food to the hospital while hospital staff patronized local businesses. After the war, the hospital&#x27;s buildings were used as Intermountain Indian School. Many young Native Americans attended the boarding school until it closed in 1984, although the Intermountain &quot;I&quot; on the mountain is still visible in tandem with Box Elder High School&#x27;s &quot;B&quot;. The facility has left its mark in a number of other ways, with most of the buildings still standing. Some have been converted into businesses and condos, while others remain empty. Utah State University purchased the site and demolished all remaining buildings in 2013. The Utah State University Brigham City regional campus will be expanded to permanent buildings on this site and will mainly serve students from Box Elder, Weber, and Davis counties. Construction will begin in the fall of 2014.

Despite layoffs over the past decade, much of Brigham City&#x27;s economy relies on Thiokol, the creator of many missiles, as well as the solid rocket booster for the Space Shuttle. Additionally, the local Autoliv (formerly a part of Thiokol) airbag plants also net Brigham City many jobs. Nucor Corporation has two facilities in Brigham City, in addition to its steel mill nearby Plymouth. The addition of a Walmart distribution center in nearby Corinne has also brought new jobs.

===Historic sites===

====Baron Woolen Mills====
Built in 1870 as part of the Brigham City Manufacturing and Mercantile Association, the mill produced high-quality blankets and sweaters from locally produced wool fleeces. It was damaged by a blaze in June 2014 and destroyed by a fire on July 20, 2015.

====Cooley Memorial Hospital====
Dr. A.D. Cooley opened this hospital in 1935, operating as the only acute care facility in Brigham City until 1976, when the Brigham City Community Hospital opened.

====Hotel Brigham====
Originally built to house transient railroad workers, rooms in Hotel Brigham were meant to be inexpensive. Very few rooms had bathrooms. An original owner was James Knudson, a former mayor of Brigham City. His grandson, Cameron Kay Harmon, became a part owner and managed the hotel after World War II and into the 1950s.

====Brigham City Archway Sign====
Installed on 6 September 1928, this sign was financed by citizen donations totaling $2,400. The sign spans the width of Main Street, welcoming visitors to the business district. Made of opalite glass, the lettering welcomes all to Brigham City, &quot;Gateway to the World&#x27;s Greatest Wild Bird Refuge.&quot;

====Brigham City Cemetery====
Established in 1853 with the burial of a pioneer infant, the Brigham City cemetery is a beautiful, old-fashioned cemetery with above-ground grave markers. A final resting place for pioneers, peach orchard farmers, cholera epidemic victims, workers, and a host of others, the cemetery is peaceful and shaded with a wide variety of grand old trees.

==In popular culture==
Brigham City was the namesake of American movie director, producer, writer, and actor Richard Dutcher&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Brigham City&quot; about murder in a fictitious small Mormon town, although it is not actually about the real Brigham City. Due to geography and population, the movie was actually filmed some 120 miles to the south in Mapleton, Utah.

Movies that have scenes filmed in Brigham City include &quot;The Work and the Story&quot;, &quot;Species&quot;, and &quot;Clay Pigeons&quot;.

The LDS Church President Brigham Young, for whom Brigham City is named, gave his final public address in the city. He gave this address in a public square that is now home to the Brigham City Museum-Gallery.

<doc id="136871" wikidata="Q1089405" url="?curid=136871" title="Port Republic, New Jersey">
<text>Port Republic is a city on the Mullica River, located in Atlantic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 1,101, a decrease of 14 (−1.3%) from the 2010 census count of 1,115, which in turn reflected an increase of 78 (+7.5%) from the 1,037 counted in the 2000 census.

It is a dry town, where alcohol is not permitted to be sold by law.

Geographically, the city, and all of Atlantic County, is part of the South Jersey region of the state and of the Atlantic City-Hammonton metropolitan statistical area, which in turn is included in the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

==History==
In 1774, Evi Smith, Hugh McCullum, and Richard Wescoat applied for a Royal charter to build a dam, sawmill, and gristmill on their land along Nacote Creek. While it has been claimed that Chestnut Neck was settled as early as 1637, no evidence to support this claim has been presented.

In its early days, Port Republic was known as Wrangleboro. During the American Revolutionary War, Port Republic provided refuge to the residents of the nearby community of Chestnut Neck when the British Army, arriving by ship, sacked their town on October 6, 1778. It had been used as a base by privateers who were capturing goods intended for British forces. Among the refugees was Daniel Mathis, a tavernkeeper who built the Franklin Inn in Port Republic, which is used as a private house today. Some of the British ships were trapped in the creek by the ebb tides. The General Lafayette Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution erected a monument on October 6, 1911, to mark the site of the Battle of Chestnut Neck. A Continental Army soldier at the top of the monument faces the river, &quot;guarding the shore&quot; against the approaching enemy.

In 1842, an effort was made to rename the area from Wrangleborough to Unionville, with a post office to be established under that name. As another Unionville existed in the state, the name &quot;Port Republic&quot; was chosen.

Port Republic was incorporated as a city by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 1, 1905, from portions of Galloway Township. The city&#x27;s name derives from the &quot;U.S. Republic&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Port Republic city had a total area of 8.55 square miles (22.14 km2), including 7.46 square miles (19.33 km2) of land and 1.09 square miles (2.81 km2) of water (12.70%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Chestnut Neck and Unionville.

The city borders the township of Galloway in Atlantic County, and both Bass River and Washington townships in Burlington County.

The city is one of 56 South Jersey municipalities that are included within the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, a protected natural area of unique ecology covering , that has been classified as a United States Biosphere Reserve and established by Congress in 1978 as the nation&#x27;s first National Reserve. Part of the city is included in the state-designated Pinelands Area, which includes portions of Atlantic County, along with areas in Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester and Ocean counties.

<doc id="136872" wikidata="Q482710" url="?curid=136872" title="Corinne, Utah">
<text>Corinne ( ) is a city in Box Elder County, Utah, United States. The population was 809 at the 2020 census, up from the 2010 figure of 685.

==History==
For almost ten years from its founding on 25 March 1869, the town of Corinne prospered as the unofficial &quot;Gentile Capital of Utah&quot;. As the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads approached their historic meeting place at Promontory Summit early in 1869, a group of former Union Army officers and some determined non-Mormon merchants from Salt Lake City decided to locate a Gentile town on the Union Pacific line, believing that the town could compete economically and politically with the Saints of Utah. They chose a location about six miles west of Brigham City on the west bank of the Bear River where the railroad crossed that stream. Named by one of the founders (General J. A. Williamson) for his fourteen-year-old daughter, Corinne was designed to be the freight-transfer point for the shipment of goods and supplies to the mining towns of western Montana along the Montana Trail.

Corinne differed from most pioneer communities in Utah because it was settled by people of different religions and even those who professed no religious affiliation. In its heyday, Corinne had some 1,000 permanent residents, not one of whom was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, according to the boast of the local newspaper. As an end-of-the-trail town, Corinne reflected a very different atmosphere and culture from the staid and quiet Mormon settlements of Utah, containing not only supply houses but also fifteen saloons and sixteen liquor stores, with an elected town marshal to keep order in this &quot;Dodge City&quot; of Utah. The permanent residents of Corinne did their best to promote a sense of community pride and peaceful cultural pursuits but had a raucous and independent clientele of freighters and stagecoach drivers to control.

With some support from political leaders in the nation&#x27;s capital and eastern newspapers, the town fathers attempted to use their position as a Gentile city to break the political and economic monopoly held by the Mormons in Utah Territory. They sought to have J. A. Williamson named territorial governor, tried to have the northern one degree of latitude of Utah added to Idaho to dismember the territory, and attempted to have Corinne named as the capital of Utah. The citizens of Corinne failed in each case to achieve their wishes, although their leaders and newspapers bombarded Washington, D.C., for help in their fight with Brigham Young and the Mormon hierarchy.

The first meeting in Corinne in 1872, Corinne Lodge No.5, was chartered as first Utah Masonic Lodge north of Salt Lake City on 11 November 1873 by the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Utah. Edmond P. Johnson, the first Master of the Lodge and a past jurisdictional judge in Box Elder County, along with many other prominent Masons of the day, are buried in the Corinne City Cemetery.

Brigham Young assured the demise of Corinne when he and the Mormon people built the narrow-gauge Utah Northern Railroad from Ogden to Franklin, Idaho. Although construction of the line beyond that point ceased for four years as a result of the Panic of 1873, in the autumn of 1877, the Union Pacific bought the spur line and began pushing it northward through Idaho. The tracks reached Marsh Valley and cut the Montana Trail at that place, thereby supplanting wagon traffic from Corinne with rail transport from Ogden. The Gentile merchants soon abandoned Corinne in favor of Ogden or the terminus of the rail line, while Mormon farmers moved in to buy the land around Corinne and make it into another Mormon settlement.

In 1877 an LDS ward was organized but was dissolved when the town suffered a decline in population. As farmers again settled the region, a Corinne Ward was again organized; during the interim, it was part of the Bear River Ward. A meetinghouse was built in 1914, and the Corinne Ward was reorganized that year with Alma Jensen as Bishop.

==Geography==

<doc id="136873" wikidata="Q1084242" url="?curid=136873" title="Somers Point, New Jersey">
<text>Somers Point is a city situated on the Jersey Shore that is the oldest settlement in Atlantic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It was settled by Europeans in 1693 and was incorporated as a borough in 1886. Somers Point was incorporated as a city in 1902. The city is located in eastern Atlantic County, southwest of Atlantic City, in the South Jersey region of the state.

As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 10,469, a decrease of 326 (−3.0%) from the 2010 census count of 10,795, which in turn reflected a decline of 819 (−7.1%) from the 11,614 counted in the 2000 census. Somers Point and all of Atlantic County lie within the Atlantic City-Hammonton metropolitan statistical area, which in turn constitutes part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area.

==History==

The earliest residents of the area were the Lenape Native Americans. John Somers was the first European settler in what is now Somers Point. Somers purchased the land along the northern periphery of the Great Egg Harbor Bay from Thomas Budd in 1693, making it the oldest European settlement in what is now Atlantic County. Great Egg Harbour Township was designated in 1693 from the eastern portions of Gloucester County, which included Somers Point. Somers named the area Somerset Plantation. In 1695, John Somers operated the first ferry service across the Great Egg Harbor Bay to Cape May County. His son Richard built Somers Mansion overlooking the harbor sometime between 1720 and 1726, which remains the county&#x27;s oldest existing home. Early names for the area were Somerset Plantation, Somers Ferry, and Somers Plantation, until the name Somers Point was established in 1750. Somers Point was designated as a port of entry in 1791 and remained one until it was abolished in 1915. By the 1830s, when Somers Point became part of Atlantic County, it was a popular summer resort with several boarding houses.
Somers Point was originally incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 24, 1886, from portions of Egg Harbor Township, based on the results of a referendum held five days earlier. At that time, there were 48 people registered to vote in the borough. Somers Point was subsequently reincorporated as a borough on April 2, 1890 based on the previous day&#x27;s referendum, and was finally incorporated as a city on April 9, 1902, from all of Somers Point borough and additional portions of Egg Harbor Township. All were named for John Somers.

<text>Deweyville is a town in Box Elder County, Utah, United States. The population was 417 at the 2020 census, up from the 2010 figure of 332.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. Much of what the local population refers to as Deweyville is actually land outside the town boundaries, located in unincorporated Box Elder County. This includes the Cedar Ridge Subdivision, a 26-house development located 1.6 miles north of incorporated Deweyville.

The town is also known for its unique location adjacent to the Wasatch Range - the steepest mountain range in the country based on the height-to-base ratio. The Deweyville portion of the western slopes of the Wasatch is home to several notable geologic and natural destinations, including Gribble Arch, Lizzy&#x27;s Landing, The Easter Caves, and The Cedar Trees. Chocolate Peak in northern Deweyville was the location of numerous winter Hillclimb attempts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

== History ==
On March 14, 1864, the John C. Dewey family, Mormon pioneer immigrants from England, left Calls Fort, Utah, and settled at Empey Springs, an area originally settled by William Empey. Empey Springs became known as Dewey Springs. Other settlers soon moved to the area.

John C. Dewey directed many community activities, including the construction of a school house in 1869 and a Sunday school in 1872. The schoolhouse served as a community center where dances were commonly held. A post office was established in 1873, with John C. Dewey as the Postmaster. In 1877, a LDS Church Ward was organized, with John C. Dewey as Bishop.

Deweyville was a stop on the Utah Northern Railroad. The Oregon Short Line Railroad took over the Utah Northern Line in 1874 and converted the tracks to standard gauge. The town served as the main shipping point for the Bear River Valley until 1901. This, along with the construction of the Bothwell and Hammond Canals, contributed to significant business development.

<doc id="136876" wikidata="Q1088520" url="?curid=136876" title="Cresskill, New Jersey">
<text>Cresskill is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 9,155, an increase of 582 (+6.8%) from the 2010 census count of 8,573, which in turn reflected an increase of 827 (+10.7%) from the 7,746 counted in the 2000 census. This town got its name from &quot;Cress&quot;, referring to the watercress that grew in its streams, and &quot;Kill&quot;, referring to the stream passing through.

==History==
Cresskill was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on May 8, 1894, from portions of Palisades Township. The borough was formed during the &quot;Boroughitis&quot; phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone. A portion of the borough was annexed by Alpine in 1904.

Railroads provided access from Cresskill to customers in New York City, including a chicken hatchery that was the world&#x27;s largest by 1897. Railroad access established the former Camp Merritt as a major debarkation point for more than a million American troops being sent abroad to fight in World War I. To commemorate the fact, a large obelisk memorial (referred to by locals as &quot;The Monument&quot;), or &quot;The Circle Monument&quot; was dedicated in 1924, set in the center of the Camp Merritt Memorial Circle at the intersection of Madison Avenue and Knickerbocker Road (CR 505).

===Historic sites===

* Blackledge-Gair House (at 111 Madison Avenue; added January 9, 1983)

* Peter Huyler House (50 County Road; added January 9, 1983)
* Benjamin P. Westervelt House (at 235 County Road; added January 9, 1983)

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 2.07 square miles (5.36 km2), including 2.07 square miles (5.35 km2) of land and 0.01 square miles (0.01 km2) of water (0.24%).

<text>East Rutherford is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is an inner-ring suburb of New York City, located west of Midtown Manhattan. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 10,022, an increase of 1,109 (+12.4%) from the 2010 census count of 8,913, which in turn reflected an increase of 197 (+2.3%) from the 8,716 counted in the 2000 census.

Under the terms of an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 17, 1889, a portion of the old Union Township was incorporated under the name of Boiling Springs Township. The new township took its name from a spring in the community. On March 28, 1894, the Borough of East Rutherford was created, based on the results of a referendum held the previous day, and Boiling Springs Township was dissolved. While there was no change in its borders, the name and form of government were changed. The borough was the second formed during the &quot;Boroughitis&quot; phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone.

East Rutherford is the home of the Meadowlands Sports Complex, which includes Meadowlands Arena and MetLife Stadium, and used to be the location of Giants Stadium. The arena is best known as the former home of the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League and of the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association, and for hosting college basketball, arena football, concerts, and other events. MetLife Stadium is home of the New York Giants and New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL), the New York Guardians of the XFL, and hosted Super Bowl XLVIII, which made East Rutherford the smallest city ever to host a Super Bowl. East Rutherford will be one of 16 venues chosen to host games for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with eight matches including the final at MetLife Stadium (New York/New Jersey Stadium). Giants Stadium, which hosted the Giants and Jets until 2009, was also the original home of the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer. East Rutherford is the only municipality with fewer than 10,000 residents to have been home to five professional sports teams simultaneously, as well as the smallest city to host any professional sports team within its city limits.

The borough is also the site of American Dream Meadowlands, a large shopping center and entertainment complex that was originally named &quot;Xanadu&quot; which opened on October 25, 2019.

<text>Edgewater is a borough located along the Hudson River in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 14,336, an increase of 2,823 (+24.5%) from the 2010 census count of 11,513, which in turn reflected an increase of 3,836 (+50.0%) from the 7,677 counted in the 2000 census

The borough&#x27;s history has featured the founding of the first colony in Bergen County, contribution to the Revolutionary War, a period as a &quot;sleepy, pastoral little town&quot; with resort hotels in the 19th century, industrialization in the early 20th century, and a transition to a rapidly growing residential community in the late 20th century.

Edgewater was incorporated as a municipality on December 7, 1894, from portions of Ridgefield Township as the Borough of Undercliff, based on the results of a referendum that passed two days earlier. The borough was formed during the &quot;Boroughitis&quot; phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone. The borough&#x27;s name was changed to Edgewater on November 8, 1899. The borough was named for its location on the Hudson River.

==History==
Algonquian people, primarily Lenape, lived in the area prior to Dutch colonisation in the 17th century. David Pietersz Devries (also transliterated as David Pietersen de Vries), the first European settler, bought of land from the Tappan tribe and established the settlement of Vriessendael in what is now Edgewater. A historical plaque placed in Veteran&#x27;s Field by the Bergen County Historical Society names Vriessendael as the first known colony in Bergen County with a founding date of 1640. Parts of Vriessendael were destroyed in 1643 during Kieft&#x27;s War in reprisal for the massacres of Lenape people taking refuge at Pavonia and Corlears Hook. In pioneer days, River Road was known as the Hackensack Turnpike, and Ox [&quot;sic&quot;] Hill Road was an important route to the top of the Palisades Cliff. While Oxen Hill Road still exists as a thoroughfare, another Colonial hallmark and major local industry has only recently disappeared: shad fishing. The Undercliff section in the northern section of Edgewater was originally a colony of fishermen. In the 1980s there were still about 100 commercial fishermen in New Jersey harvesting shad from their annual spring run from the Atlantic Ocean up the Hudson River to spawn. Now there are none.

Etienne Burdett began ferry service between north Edgewater and the island of Manhattan in 1758. His gambrel-roofed house in what is now the Edgewater Colony stood until 1899. The ferry service at Burdett&#x27;s Landing, which was located at the southern base of the bluff of Fort Lee, proved valuable to the American cause during the Revolutionary War. The ferry functioned as the link for supplies, information and transportation between Fort Lee on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River and Fort Washington on the New York side. In the century following the Revolutionary war, north Edgewater developed into a resort area with large hotels built in the mid- and late 19th century. It was in the 19th century that Burdett&#x27;s Landing became known as &quot;Old Stone Dock&quot;, as cobblestones quarried from the Palisades Cliffs by Russell &amp; Read were shipped across the Hudson to fill the demand for paving Manhattan streets. Concern over the destruction caused by quarrying operations led to the formation of the Palisades Interstate Park in 1900, which was effective in preserving the cliffs. Although the first chemical plant was founded in 1843 in the south section of the borough, throughout the 19th century the town retained a bucolic character. Early in the 20th century the addition of landfill to the Hudson River changed the borough&#x27;s appearance. Until that time, the Hudson River lay closer to River Road from just above Veteran&#x27;s field southward to what is now the Binghamton Ferry Plaza.
The 20th century brought great change to Edgewater with industrialization, which overwhelmed the borough and filled of the shoreline with its operations. Transportation of factory goods was facilitated when the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway cut the Edgewater Tunnel through the Palisades in 1894 to connect the borough to its main line. Edgewater was also well situated for shipping, with deep water piers on the Hudson River and access to abundant labor from Manhattan. Generally, industrial development occurred in the southern end of the borough, while the northern end remained residential. As industrialization increased in the borough, picnic grounds lost their appeal and resort hotels faded. By 1918, there were 8,044 workers employed by Edgewater&#x27;s manufacturing facilities, producing primarily chemicals, dyes, and confectionery products such as oils and sugars. Prominent industries of Edgewater included a Ford assembly plant, Alcoa, Valvoline, and the American Can Company. Railroad trains served various factories, traversing tracks laid in River Road. During the first 30 years of the century, Edgewater&#x27;s population quadrupled, and the transient workforce increased tenfold. Eventually the factories closed. The reasons were varied, but they included the globalization of industry, obsolete facilities and the replacement of railroad shipping by trucking, which could not run its large tractor trailer trucks on Edgewater&#x27;s narrow streets.

Joseph Mitchell&#x27;s essay &quot;The Rivermen&quot;, which was published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and is included in his book &quot;The Bottom of the Harbor&quot;, provides an evocative portrait of life in Edgewater in the early 20th century.

The late 20th century history of Edgewater was one of change from an industrialized town to a residential one. With the closing of the factories, development initially came to Edgewater in the 1960s and grew exponentially in the early 1980s, as developers began projects to convert the industrial sites that had historically led to Edgewater not being considered as an option for development. As condominiums were built along the Hudson where industry had formerly operated, the population of Edgewater grew rapidly. The population had been mostly in the 4,000 to 5,000 range from 1930 to 1990, then increased by 50% to 7,677 in 2000 and again by 50% to 11,513 in the 2010 Census. Borough council members and residents acknowledge that population growth has exacerbated the problem of increased traffic. With the transition from industrial to residential, crime statistics were down, with the police chief describing how bar fights between factory workers were commonplace in the early 1970s, while real estate values are up. Because of the expense of buying property, some currently refer to Edgewater as part of the Gold Coast. A photographic history of Edgewater describes the population and demographics change and its possible consequence this way: Now a good number of residents live on the river in condominiums and rental apartments and town houses on land that was once the province of heavy industry. Some see this as the creation of a town divided, with the newcomers living on the east side of River Road by the Hudson River and the old-timers living on the west side of River Road.

Although the borough is unrecognizable as the industrial town it once was, growing pains have left marks. When the old Alcoa plant site from 1916 began to be converted to condominiums, construction was forced to halt for cleanup of industrial contaminants, including excessively high concentrations of PCBs. In another case, construction of a condominium/shopping center in south Edgewater was interrupted for six months by safety measures to protect workers from chemical exposure in the lead- and arsenic-riddled soil. Next to this structure, behind a chain link fence lies a Superfund site. Operational Hess Oil tanks, beside the derelict Alcoa rolling mill, once the second-largest in the world, are a reminder of the borough&#x27;s industrial phase. The building, occupying 1,100,000 square feet (100,000 m2) of space, was designed in 1914 and was used to roll ingots of aluminum into sheets that were used to create everything from toothpaste tubes to aircraft frames, before the facility was abandoned in 1967 due to lack of space needed to expand the facility.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 2.46 square miles (6.36 km2), including 0.97 square miles (2.52 km2) of land and 1.48 square miles (3.84 km2) of water (60.33%).
The borough is a narrow strip of land along the Hudson River, with of waterfront. The Palisades Cliff rises dramatically and forms a natural border on its western side, running roughly parallel to the Hudson, with Fort Lee and Cliffside Park atop the cliff, north and south, respectively. Edgewater abuts Fort Lee Historic Park in the borough of Fort Lee on the north.

River Road, which overlooks the Hudson River and the Manhattan skyline, runs into and out of the town from the north and south, lying just above the level of the Hudson. Three roads lead up the Palisades Cliff: Route 5, with one switchback, ascends to Palisades Avenue, which leads north into Fort Lee and south into Cliffside Park. Gorge Road and Edgewater Road, the latter still referred to by many local residents by its Colonial-era name as Oxen Hill Road, lead up the Palisades to Cliffside Park.

The borough borders Cliffside Park and Fort Lee in Bergen County; North Bergen in Hudson County; and the New York City borough of Manhattan across the Hudson River.

==Economy==
Edgewater was the location of the Lever Brothers research center where chemist Vincent Lamberti, a holder of over 118 patents, spent most of his 40 years for the company, and where he invented Dove soap, the first soap not made with animal fat.

Edgewater has five main shopping areas. From north to south they are Town Centre, the Binghamton Shopping Plaza, Mitsuwa Marketplace, Edgewater Commons and City Place. All are located on the river side of River Road and bordered by the River Walk. As recently as 1984 the town had no supermarket. With development in subsequent years, by 2017, groceries couuld be purchased at Whole Foods Market in Town Centre, Trader Joe&#x27;s at the Binghamton Plaza, Japanese-labeled groceries at Mitsuwa Marketplace and at Acme Markets in Edgewater Commons. Company-operated shuttle buses that ran on Wednesdays and Thursdays, bringing shoppers to Mitsuwa from Manhattan, were terminated in 2014.

==Arts and culture==
Borough Hall, the Binghamton Ferry and the Edgewater Public Library are listed on both the National Register of Historic Places and the New Jersey Register of Historic Places. Constructed in 1904, Borough Hall was granted $406,000 by Senate and General Assembly of New Jersey in August 2009 for restoration of the building. Among other renovations, the missing gargoyles were returned to the 1902 edifice.

The Binghamton Ferry, permanently anchored at the Binghamton Shopping Plaza, was built in 1904–1905 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia. The only double-ended steam-powered ferry boat still on the Hudson River, the Binghamton ferried passengers from New Jersey to Barclay Street in Manhattan for many years and was retired in 1967.

One of the remaining Carnegie libraries in New Jersey, built with $15,000 in funds from the Carnegie Foundation, the Edgewater Free Library was dedicated on February 8, 1916. Edgewater opened its library in 1910, prior to the donation from the Carnegie Foundation, with 817 books on its shelves.

In addition to these sites, the Eleanor Van Gelder School is listed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places.

===The River Walk===
The promenade along the Hudson is part of the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway. In 1988, construction of a waterfront walkway was mandated by state law that would allow walkers a path along the Hudson River from Bayonne up to the George Washington Bridge. Although property owners were required to build and maintain it, many gaps remain. Of the called for, only are complete, and many of the gaps occur in Edgewater. The completed stretches offer paths for walking along the Hudson River with views of Manhattan.

===Edgewater parrots===

Edgewater is the home of a free-flying colony of monk parakeets, also known as Quaker parrots, which are native to South America. These small, green parrots have lived in Edgewater since at least 1980 and were numbered at 200 to 230 in a 2008 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and about 200 in 2019. They are easily seen in Memorial Park and its vicinity at River Road and Route 5. The parrots build large nests of twigs and down which become permanent residences. Nests four-feet long can be seen near the intersection. How the birds came to Edgewater is unknown, though a widely accepted story traces their origin to an escape from a damaged crate at John F. Kennedy Airport in the 1960s, or alternatively they had been pets that escaped from their owners.

The birds have built nests against transformers on utility poles. Citing the risk of fire, the utility PSE&amp;G has destroyed such nests. This has brought the utility into conflict with parrot advocates. In 2008, PSE&amp;G agreed not to take down nests during breeding season.

==Parks and recreation==

 Veterans&#x27; Field offers residents recreational opportunities and provides space for a Community Center and American Legion Post 116. Veterans&#x27; Field is located on River Road (County Route 505) in the north section of Edgewater, lying along the Hudson River. It has indoor and outdoor basketball courts, three softball fields, a 1/3 mile-long track which accommodates runners, walkers and skaters; tennis courts, a Little League field and a playground. It is also the site of a large American flag which can easily be seen from across the river in Manhattan. A plaque commemorating the New Netherland plantation of David Pietersen de Vries, Vriessendael, is located at the entrance to the field on the west. Although the field extends well to the east, it did not exist in de Vries&#x27;s day. In 1922, landfill was dumped into the Hudson River from the construction site of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, which gives Veteran&#x27;s Field its current dimensions. In September 2011, Veteran&#x27;s Field was closed due to soil contamination in the fill brought to the site.

==Government==
===Local government===
Edgewater is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Edgewater is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of Edgewater is Democrat Michael McPartland, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Edgewater Borough Council are Anthony Bartolomeo (D, 2024), Rinaldy &quot;Ray&quot; Gutierrez (D, 2026), Dolores Lawlor (D, 2024), Donald A. Martin (D, 2025), Vincent J. Monte (D, 2025) and Jose Luis Vidal (D, 2026).

In January 2015, Dolores Lawlor was selected from the borough council from a list of three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the vacant seat expiring in December 2015 of Kevin Doran, who resigned from office earlier that month after announcing that he was moving out of the borough.

Democrat Agnes &quot;Nancy&quot; Merse, whose term as mayor was to expire on December 31, 2011, died due to complications from cancer on March 10, 2011. Councilmember James Delaney was chosen in April 2011 to fill Merse&#x27;s vacancy as mayor. Michael H. Henwood was chosen to fill Delaney&#x27;s vacant council seat, and served the remainder of that term until December 2011 before he was elected to serve a full term in office.

The Edgewater administrative offices and police department moved from 916 River Road to the new Borough Hall, 55 River Road, in 2011, with a dedication ceremony on October 16. The new building includes of space, offering relief from cramped conditions with 150% more floor space, and expanded parking facilities.

CNBC, LG North American headquarters, and Unilever North America are headquartered in Englewood Cliffs.

LG Electronics held a groundbreaking ceremony on November 14, 2013, to build an environmentally friendly North American headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, having received a favorable legal decision subsequently being appealed based upon building height issues. Protesters have sharply criticized the proposal, arguing that the height of the building exceeds the borough&#x27;s limit and that the height of the building above the tree line will disrupt views of the Palisades.

The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

<doc id="136882" wikidata="Q1013261" url="?curid=136882" title="Fort Lee, New Jersey">
<text>Fort Lee is a borough at the eastern border of Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, situated along the Hudson River atop The Palisades.

As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 40,191, an increase of 4,846 (+13.7%) from the 2010 census count of 35,345, which in turn reflected a decline of 116 (−0.3%) from the 35,461 counted in the 2000 census. Along with other communities in Bergen County, it is one of the largest and fastest-growing ethnic Korean enclaves outside of Korea.

Fort Lee is named for the site of an American Revolutionary War military encampment. At the turn of the 20th century it became the birthplace of the American film industry. In 1931, the borough became the western terminus of the George Washington Bridge, which crosses the Hudson River and connects to the borough of Manhattan in New York City. Fort Lee&#x27;s population and housing density has increased considerably since the 1960s and 1970s with the construction of highrise apartment buildings.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Fort Lee borough had a total area of 2.87 square miles (7.44 km2), including 2.52 square miles (6.52 km2) of land and 0.35 square miles (0.92 km2) of water (12.33%).

The borough is situated atop the escarpment of the Hudson Palisades on the peninsula between the Hackensack and Hudson rivers. The borough is bisected by the confluence of roads at the George Washington Bridge Plaza leading to the George Washington Bridge.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the borough include Coytesville, Linwood, Palisade and Taylorville.

The borough borders Cliffside Park, Edgewater, Englewood, Englewood Cliffs, Leonia, Palisades Park, and Ridgefield in Bergen County, along with the Washington Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan in New York City. Given its evolving cosmopolitan ambiance and adjacency to Manhattan across the George Washington Bridge, Fort Lee, one of the Hudson Waterfront communities of northern New Jersey, has been called a sixth borough of New York City.

==History==
===Early settlement===
The Lenape peoples were inhabiting the area when Captain Henry Hudson was the first European to record the area in 1609. In 1756 Stephen Bourdette acquired 400 acres of land which included modern-day Fort Lee.

===Colonial era===

Originally known as Fort Constitution, Fort Lee was named for General Charles Lee after George Washington and his troops had camped at Mount Constitution overlooking Burdett&#x27;s Landing, in defense of New York City. It was during Washington&#x27;s retreat in November 1776 (beginning along a road which is now Main Street) that Thomas Paine composed his pamphlet, &quot;The American Crisis&quot;, which began with the recognized phrase, &quot;These are the times that try men&#x27;s souls.&quot; These events are recalled at Monument Park and Fort Lee Historic Park.

===Formation===
Fort Lee was formed by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 29, 1904, from the remaining portions of Ridgefield Township. With the creation of Fort Lee, Ridgefield Township became defunct and was dissolved as of March 29, 1904. The Fort Lee Police Department was formed under borough ordinance on August 9, 1904, and originally consisted of six marshals.

===America&#x27;s first motion picture industry===

The history of cinema in the United States can trace its roots to the East Coast, where, at one time, Fort Lee was the motion picture capital of America. The industry got its start in the state at the end of the 19th century with the construction of Thomas Edison&#x27;s &quot;Black Maria&quot;, the first motion picture studio, in West Orange, New Jersey. New Jersey offered land at costs considerably less than New York City, and the cities and towns along the Hudson River and the Palisades benefited greatly as a result of the phenomenal growth of the film industry at the turn of the 20th century. A large number of early films were shot in Fort Lee.

Filmmaking began attracting both capital and an innovative workforce, and when the Kalem Company began using Fort Lee in 1907 as a location for filming in the area, other filmmakers quickly followed. In 1909, a forerunner of Universal Studios, the Champion Film Company, built the first studio. They were quickly followed by others who either built new studios or who leased facilities in Fort Lee. In the 1910s and 1920s, film companies such as the Independent Moving Pictures Company, Peerless Studios, The Solax Company, Éclair Studios, Goldwyn Picture Corporation, American Méliès (Star Films), World Film Company, Biograph Studios, Fox Film Corporation, Pathé Frères, Metro Pictures Corporation, Victor Film Company, and Selznick Pictures Corporation were all making pictures in Fort Lee. Such notables as Mary Pickford got their start at Biograph Studios.

With the offshoot businesses that sprang up to service the film studios, for nearly two decades Fort Lee experienced unrivaled prosperity. However, just as the development of Fort Lee production facilities was gaining strength, Nestor Studios of Bayonne, New Jersey, built the first studio in Hollywood in 1911. Nestor Studios, owned by David and William Horsley, later merged with Universal Studios; and William Horsley&#x27;s other company, Hollywood Film Laboratory, is now the oldest existing company in Hollywood, now called the Hollywood Digital Laboratory. California&#x27;s more temperate climate enabled year-round filming and led to the eventual shift of virtually all filmmaking to the West Coast by the 1930s.

At the time, Thomas Edison owned almost all the patents relevant to motion picture production. Movie producers on the East Coast acting independently of Edison&#x27;s Motion Picture Patents Company were often sued or enjoined by Edison and his agents, while movie makers working on the West Coast could work independently of Edison&#x27;s control, in part due to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals–which was headquartered in San Francisco and covered most of Southern California–being well known for not enforcing patents claims.

In nearby Little Ferry on July 9, 1937, a major fire broke out in a 20th Century-Fox storage facility containing hazardous extremely flammable nitrate film reels.

Television and film in New Jersey remains an important industry. Since 2000, the Fort Lee Film Commission has been charged with celebrating the history of film in Fort Lee, as well as attracting film and television production companies to the borough. The Barrymore Film Center promotes films, filmmaking and its history in the borough.

===Birthplace of subliminal messaging===
In 1957, market researcher James Vicary claimed that quickly flashing messages on a movie screen, in Fort Lee, had influenced people to purchase more food and drinks. Vicary coined the term &quot;subliminal advertising&quot; and formed the Subliminal Projection Company based on a six-week test. Vicary claimed that during the presentation of the movie &quot;Picnic&quot; he used a tachistoscope to project the words &quot;Drink Coca-Cola&quot; and &quot;Hungry? Eat popcorn&quot; for 1/3000 of a second at five-second intervals. Vicary asserted that during the test, sales of popcorn and Coke in that New Jersey theater increased 57.8% and 18.1% respectively.

In 1962, Vicary admitted to lying about the experiment and falsifying the results, the story itself being a marketing ploy. An identical experiment conducted by Henry Link showed no increase in cola or popcorn sales. The additional claim that the small cinema handled 45,699 visitors in six weeks has led people to believe that Vicary actually did not conduct his experiment at all.

=== Korean community ===
A small number of Korean immigrants have resided the area as early as the 1970s. In the 1990s, a continuous stream of Korean immigrants emerged into Fort Lee. A substantial number of affluent and educated Korean American professionals have settled in Bergen County since the early 2000s and have founded various academic and communally supportive organizations, including the Korean Parent Partnership Organization at the Bergen County Academies magnet high school and The Korean-American Association of New Jersey. Approximately 130 Korean stores were counted in downtown Fort Lee in 2000, a number which has risen significantly since then, featuring restaurants and karaoke (&quot;noraebang&quot;) bars, grocery markets, education centers and bookstores, banking institutions, offices, electronics vendors, apparel boutiques, and other commercial enterprises.

Various Korean American groups could not reach consensus on the design and wording for a monument in Fort Lee as of early April 2013 to the memory of comfort women, tens of thousands of women and girls, many Korean, who were forced into sexual slavery by Japanese soldiers during World War II. In May 2012, borough officials in neighboring Palisades Park rejected requests by two diplomatic delegations from Japan to remove such a monument from a public park, a brass plaque on a block of stone, dedicated in 2010; days later, a South Korean delegation had endorsed Palisades Park&#x27;s decision. In October 2012, a similar memorial was announced in nearby Hackensack, to be raised behind the Bergen County Courthouse, alongside memorials to the Holocaust, the Great Famine of Ireland, and the Armenian genocide, and was unveiled in March 2013. On May 23, 2018, a comfort women memorial was installed in Constitution Park in Fort Lee. Youth Council of Fort Lee, a student organization led by Korean American high school students in Fort Lee designed the memorial.

===George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal===

The Fort Lee lane closure scandal, also known as Bridgegate, was a political scandal concerning the actions taken by the staff of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and his Port Authority appointees to create a traffic jam in Fort Lee when dedicated toll lanes for one of the Fort Lee entrances to the upper level on the George Washington Bridge were reduced from three to one from September 9, 2013, to September 13, 2013. Three members of the Christie administration were convicted on federal conspiracy charges for their roles in the lane closures.

One of the reasons suggested for these actions was to punish Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for not supporting the Republican Chris Christie in the 2013 New Jersey gubernatorial election. Another theory was that Christie or his aides sought to punish New Jersey Senate majority leader, Loretta Weinberg, who represented the New Jersey district containing Fort Lee, as retribution for the Democrats&#x27; blocking of Christie&#x27;s reappointment of a New Jersey Supreme Court justice. Christie withdrew his appointee consideration and delivered a speech referring to New Jersey Senate Democrats as &quot;animals&quot; just one day before emails were sent by Christie&#x27;s aides to the Port Authority requesting the lane closures.

==Demographics==
At the turn of the 21st century, Fort Lee saw a large Korean migration which has converted much of the town into a large Koreatown, in that many traditional Korean stores and restaurants may be seen in Fort Lee, and the hangul letters of the Korean alphabet are as common as signs in English in parts of the downtown area. This Koreatown is separate from the similar Korean enclave in the adjacent town of Palisades Park. The rapid increase of the Korean population has seen the decline of many other immigrant communities once centered in Fort Lee, notably the Greek and Italian communities, once quite large. A sizable Russian immigrant community has also sprung up in recent years.

The per capita Korean American population of Bergen County, 6.3% by the 2010 census, (increasing to 6.9% by the 2011 American Community Survey), is the highest of any county in the United States, with all of the nation&#x27;s top ten municipalities by percentage of Korean population and an absolute total of 56,773 Korean Americans (increasing to 63,247 by the 2011 American Community Survey) living in the county. The concentration of Korean Americans in nearby Palisades Park in turn is the highest of any municipality in Bergen County, at 52% of the population, enumerating 10,115 residents of Korean ancestry; while Fort Lee has nearly as many Koreans by absolute numbers, at 8,318, representing 23.5% of its 2010 population. Along with Koreatowns in New York City and Long Island, the Bergen County Koreatowns serve as the nexus for an overall Korean American population of 218,764 individuals in the Greater New York Combined Statistical Area, the second largest population of ethnic Koreans outside of Korea.


In March 2011, about 2,500 Japanese-Americans were living in Edgewater and Fort Lee, the largest concentration of Japanese-Americans in New Jersey.

There were 1,119 Fort Lee residents who filed claims to recover lost money from the Madoff investment scandal, the most from any ZIP code.

<text>Garfield is a city in Bergen County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 32,655, an increase of 2,168 (+7.1%) from the 2010 census count of 30,487, which in turn reflected an increase of 701 (+2.4%) from the 29,786 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
Long the home of the Lenape, Native Americans, European settlement in the area that would become Garfield dates back to 1679, when Jacques Cortelyou acquired more than of land surrounding the Passaic River known as &quot;Acqueyquinonke&quot;, that ran from the Saddle River to present day Glen Rock.

When the area that is now Garfield was first developed in 1873 with an initial group of seven homes constructed by Gilbert D. Bogart, it was known as East Passaic.

In 1881, the community&#x27;s name was changed to Garfield in honor of President of the United States James Garfield. There are two explanations given for the circumstances behind the renaming. According to one, shortly after Garfield was elected to the presidency the founder of East Passaic said, &quot;tell everyone...don&#x27;t speak of East Passaic anymore; call it &#x27;Garfield&#x27; after the man who will lead this great country to prosperity.&quot; Seven months later, President Garfield was assassinated but his name remained with the community. The second theory holds that after Garfield&#x27;s death in 1881, a new train station was named in his honor, which in turn led to the surrounding area becoming associated with his name as well.

Garfield was originally incorporated as a borough on March 15, 1898, from portions of Saddle River Township and Wallington. At the time, the New Jersey Legislature set Garfield&#x27;s boundaries as they exist today. On April 19, 1917, the borough became the City of Garfield, based on the results of a referendum held two days earlier.

==Geography==

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Belmont, Bogart Heights, Dundee Dam and Plauderville.

In November 2015, following a referendum that supported the move by a 3-1 margin, the City Council voted to shift the city&#x27;s municipal elections from May to November, citing hopes for greater voter participation and potential savings of $50,000 for each election; the shift result in the extension of terms for the then-serving council and municipal manager by six months, to the end of December 2016. The most recent municipal election was held on November 8, 2016, together with the presidential election.

==History==
Glen Rock was formed on September 14, 1894, from portions of Ridgewood Township and Saddle River Township during the &quot;Boroughitis&quot; phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone. The main impetus for the break from Ridgewood Township was the decision to have Glen Rock students attend a new school closer to the center of Ridgewood instead of their one-room schoolhouse located at the intersection of Ackerman Avenue and Rock Road. Originally, the borough was to be named &quot;South Ridgewood&quot;, but in order to prevent confusion with the neighboring Ridgewood Village, resident Monsieur Viel suggested the alternative name of Glen Rock.

The borough was settled around the Glen Rock, a large boulder in a small valley (glen), from which the borough gets its name. The rock, a glacial erratic weighing in at and located where Doremus Avenue meets Rock Road, is believed to have been carried to the site by a glacier that picked up the rock 15,000 years ago near Peekskill, New York, and carried it for to its present location. The Lenape Native Americans called the boulder &quot;Pamachapuka&quot; (meaning &quot;stone from heaven&quot; or &quot;stone from the sky&quot;) and used it for signal fires and as a trail marker.

The borough was the site of one of Bergen County&#x27;s most serious public transportation accidents. In 1911, a trolley operator for the North Jersey Rapid Transit Company, one day away from retirement, died in a crash with an opposing trolley around the intersection of Prospect and Grove Streets that was caused by signal problems. In addition to the death of the opposing trolley operator, 12 people were injured. This crash in part hastened the demise of this transportation mode which ran from Elmwood Park, New Jersey, to Suffern, New York, and competed with the Erie Railroad. The right of way for this trolley line was purchased by the Public Service Enterprise Group and is still visible today.

==Government==
===Local government===

Glen Rock is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.

The borough form of government used by Glen Rock is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council. The council appoints a professional borough administrator who is the chief administrative officer of the borough, responsible to the mayor and council.

, the mayor of Glen Rock is Democrat Kristine Morieko, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Borough Council are Council President Jill Orlich (D, 2024), Mary Barchetto (D, 2024), Teresa M. G. Gilbreath (D, 2025), Paula Gilligan (D, 2025), Amy Martin (D, 2026) and Regina Viadro (D, 2026).&gt;

In January 2020, the borough council chose Caroline Unzaga from a list of three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2021 that had been held by Kristine Morieko until she stepped down to take office as mayor.

In July 2019, the borough council selected Michelle Torpey from a list of three names nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2019 that was vacated by Bill J. Leonard Jr. after he resigned from office and announced that he was moving out of the borough.

Packer&#x27;s Democratic running-mates William &quot;Skip&quot; Huisking and Kristine Morieko were also elected to three-year Borough Council terms, giving the borough a Democratic mayor for the first time in 12 years, and a 3–3 split on the council.

<doc id="136885" wikidata="Q138458" url="?curid=136885" title="Hackensack, New Jersey">
<text>Hackensack is the most populous municipality and the county seat of Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The area was officially named New Barbadoes Township until 1921, but has informally been known as Hackensack since at least the 18th century. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 46,030, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 3,020 (+7.0%) from the 2010 census count of 43,010, which in turn reflected an increase of 333 (+0.8%) from the 42,677 counted in the 2000 census.

An inner suburb of New York City, Hackensack is located approximately northwest of Midtown Manhattan and about from the George Washington Bridge. From a number of locations, including portions of Prospect Avenue, the New York City skyline can be seen.

The Metropolitan Campus of Fairleigh Dickinson University straddles the Hackensack River in both Hackensack and Teaneck. Hackensack is also the home of the former New Jersey Naval Museum and the World War II submarine &quot;USS Ling&quot;. Astronaut Wally Schirra is perhaps Hackensack&#x27;s most famous .

The city has diverse neighborhoods and land uses located close to one another. Within its borders are the Hackensack University Medical Center, a residential high-rise district about a mile long (along Prospect Avenue between Beech Street and Passaic Street), suburban neighborhoods of single-family houses, stately older homes on acre-plus lots, older two-family neighborhoods, large garden apartment complexes, industrial areas, the Bergen County Jail, a tidal river, Hackensack River County Park, Borg&#x27;s Woods Nature Preserve, various city parks, large office buildings, a major college campus, the Bergen County Court House, a vibrant small-city downtown district, and various small neighborhood business districts.

==History==

The earliest known inhabitants of the area were the Lenni Lenape, an Algonquian people who became known to settlers as &#x27;the Delaware Indians.&#x27; They lived along a river they called &quot;Achinigeu-hach&quot;, or &quot;Ackingsah-sack&quot;, which translates to stony ground—today this river is more commonly known by the name &#x27;the Hackensack River.&#x27; A representation of Chief Oratam of the Achkinhenhcky appears on the Hackensack municipal seal. The most common explanation is that the city was named for the Native American tribe, though other sources attribute it to a Native American word variously translated as meaning &quot;hook mouth&quot;, &quot;stream that unites with another on low ground&quot;, &quot;on low ground&quot; or &quot;land of the big snake&quot;, while another version described as &quot;more colorful than probable&quot; attributes the name to an inn called the &quot;Hock and Sack&quot;.

Settlement by the Dutch West India Company in New Netherland on the west banks of the Hudson River across from New Amsterdam (present-day lower Manhattan) began in the 1630s at Pavonia, eventually leading to the establishment of Bergen (at today&#x27;s Bergen Square in Jersey City) in 1660.

Oratam, sachem of the Lenni Lenape, deeded the land along mid-Hackensack River to the Dutch in 1665. The area was soon taken by the English in 1667, but kept its Dutch name. Philip Cartaret, governor of what became the proprietary colony of East Jersey granted land to Captain John Berry in the area of Achter Kol and soon after took up residence and called it &quot;New Barbadoes,&quot; after having resided on the island of Barbados. In 1666, a deed was confirmed for the tract that had been given earlier by Oratem to Sarah Kiersted in gratitude for her work as emissary and interpreter. Other grants were given at the English Neighborhood.

In 1675, the East Jersey Legislature established the administrative districts Bergen, Essex, Middlesex, and Monmouth. In 1683, Bergen (along with the three other counties) was officially recognized as an independent county by the Provincial Assembly. The seal of Bergen County bearing this date includes an image of an agreement between the European settlers and the Native Americans.

New Barbadoes Township, together with Acquackanonk Township, were formed by Royal charter on October 31, 1693.

In 1700, the village of Hackensack was little more than the area around Main Street from the Courthouse to around Anderson Street. New Barbadoes Township included what is now Maywood, Rochelle Park, Paramus and River Edge, along with those portions of Oradell that are west of the Hackensack River. These areas were all sparsely populated and consisted of farm fields, woods and swamplands. The few roads that existed then included the streets now known as Kinderkamack Road, Paramus Road/Passaic Street and Essex Street. The southernmost portions of what is now Hackensack were not part of New Barbadoes Township at that time and were acquired in the late 1800s.

The neighborhood that came to be known as the village of Hackensack (today the area encompassing Bergen County&#x27;s municipal buildings in Hackensack) was a part of Essex County until 1710, when Bergen County, by royal decree of Queen Anne of Great Britain, was enlarged and the Township of New Barbadoes was removed from Essex County and added to Bergen County.

In 1710, the village of Hackensack (in the newly formed Township of New Barbadoes) was designated as being more centrally located and more easily reached by the majority of the Bergen County&#x27;s inhabitants and, hence, was chosen as the county seat of Bergen County, as it remains today. The earliest records of the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders date back to 1715, at which time agreement was made to build a courthouse and jail complex, which was completed in 1716.

During the American Revolutionary War, George Washington headquartered in the village of Hackensack in November 1776 during the retreat from Fort Lee via New Bridge Landing and camped on &#x27;The Green&#x27; across from the First Dutch Reformed Church on November 20, 1776. A raid by British forces against Hackensack on March 23, 1780, resulted in the destruction by fire of the original courthouse structure.

The Hackensack Improvement Commission was incorporated by an Act of the state legislature approved on April 1, 1868, within New Barbadoes township and including the village of Hackensack, with authority to develop sewers and other improvements in Hackensack.

The New Jersey Legislature passed the Township School Act in 1894, under which each village, borough, town, or city in New Jersey was delegated responsibility for its own public schools through the office of the county superintendent. Hackensack established a local board of education in 1894, as required by the new law, which took over operation of schools located in the township and established Hackensack High School. The 1894 act allowed local residents, by petition, to change municipal boundaries at will, setting off fearsome political battles statewide.

Portions of the township had been taken to form Harrington Township (June 22, 1775), Lodi Township (March 1, 1826), Midland Township (March 7, 1871) and Little Ferry (September 20, 1894). After these departures, secessions, and de-annexations, all that was left of New Barbadoes Township was the village of Hackensack and its surrounding neighborhoods of Fairmount, Red Hill and Cherry Hill. In 1896, New Barbadoes acquired a portion of Lodi Township covering an area south of Essex Street from the bend of Essex Street to the Maywood border. That same year the Hackensack Improvement commission was abolished and the City of Hackensack and New Barbadoes Township became coterminous.

The final parcel lost by New Barbadoes Township was the northeastern corner of what is now Little Ferry, which was incorporated in September 1894.

An act of the State Legislature incorporated the Fairmount section of New Barbadoes with the Hackensack Improvement Commission, and eliminated New Barbadoes Township as a political entity. On November 21, 1921, based on the results of a referendum held on November 8, 1921, New Barbadoes Township received its charter to incorporate as a city and &quot;officially&quot; took on its name &quot;Hackensack,&quot; a name derived from its original inhabitants, the Lenni Lenape, who named it &quot;Ackingsah-sack&quot;.

In 1933, Hackensack adopted the Manager form of government under the terms of the 1923 Municipal Manager Law, with five Council persons all elected at-large and a mayor selected by the council from among its members.

The Sears location on Main Street, which opened on October 27, 1932, and was the last freestanding Sears in the state of New Jersey, closed on September 12, 2020.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 4.35 square miles (11.27 km2), including 4.19 square miles (10.86 km2) of land and 0.16 square miles (0.41 km2) of water (3.63%).

The city is bordered by the Bergen County municipalities of Bogota, Hasbrouck Heights, Little Ferry, Lodi, Maywood, Paramus, Ridgefield Park, River Edge, South Hackensack, Teaneck and Teterboro.

There are many houses of historic value, and some of these were identified in the 1990 Master Plan. The city does not have any registered historic districts, or any restrictions on preserving the historic facade in any portions of the city. Areas considered suburban single-family residential neighborhoods account for about one-third of the city&#x27;s area, mostly along its western side.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the city include Fairmount and North Hackensack.

==Demographics==
===Ethnic diversity===
As the initial destination for many immigrants to Bergen County from around the globe, Hackensack&#x27;s ethnic composition has become exceptionally diverse. As of 2013, approximately 38.9% of the population were foreign-born. In addition, 2.5% were born in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico or abroad to American parents. Over half, 51.7%, of the population over the age of five speak only English in their household, while 32.5% of the population speak Spanish at home.

Hackensack&#x27;s Hispanic population has also risen rapidly, to over 15,000 in 2010; Ecuadoreans, Dominicans, and Colombians have become the top Hispanic groups in northern Hackensack. The Black population dropped as a percentage, although minimally in absolute numbers between 2000 and 2010. The city lost approximately 10% of its White population between 2000 and 2010, which has stabilized and resumed growth since 2010 and has remained substantial, at over 20,000 in 2010. The city has also witnessed greatly increasing diversity in its non-Hispanic white segment, with large numbers of Eastern Europeans, Eurasians, Central Asians, and Arabic immigrants offsetting the loss in Hackensack&#x27;s earlier established Italian American, Irish American, and German American populations.

==Parks and recreation==
Borg&#x27;s Woods Nature Preserve is a wooded municipal park covering . Efforts to create the park date back to a 1979 study that showed that the city had less parkland available to residents than specified by benchmarks.

==Government==
===Local government===
Hackensack operates under the 1923 Municipal Manager Law form of New Jersey municipal government. The city is one of seven municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The City Council is comprised of five members who are elected to four-year terms on a concurrent basis in a non-partisan election held every four years in May. This form of government separates policy making (the work of the mayor and city council) from the execution of policy (the work of the city manager). This maintains professional management and a Citywide perspective through: nonpartisan election, at-large representation, concentration of executive responsibility in the hands of a professional manager accountable to the Mayor and Council, concentration of policy making power in one body: a five-person Mayor and Council. In the several decades in which the City has used the Municipal Manager form of government, Hackensack has had only nine City Managers.

, the mayor of the City of Hackensack is John P. Labrosse Jr., whose term of office as mayor ends June 30, 2025, along with those of all other councilmembers. The other members of the Hackensack City Council are Deputy Mayor Deputy Mayor Kathleen Canestrino, Leonardo &quot;Leo&quot; Battaglia, Gerard Carroll and Stephanie Von Rudenborg.

Led by Mayor Labrosse, a team of candidates including four incumbents (and one newcomer) won the May 2021 municipal election. The winning slate defeated two other groups of five candidates, one of which was led by former deputy mayor David Sims.

The May 2017 election was won by the Labrosse Team, which include the mayor and three other incumbents, joined by one newcomer.

In April 2015, the city council selected Jason Some on an interim basis to fill the vacant seat of Rose Greenman, who had resigned the previous month citing claims that her council colleagues had discriminated against her. In the November 2015 general election, Deborah Keeling-Geddis was elected to serve the balance of the term of office, edging interim councilmember Jason Some by 24 votes in the final count, with four candidates running for the seat.

City Council candidate Joseph DeFalco, principal of Hackensack High School, died of a heart attack the day of the municipal election in 2005, but was elected despite his death. His running mates agreed to create a rotation under which each of the four surviving members of the New Visions for Hackensack slate would serve for a year as Mayor, creating a series of firsts for the City. Townes took office in 2005 as the city&#x27;s first black mayor, and Sasso became the first female mayor in 2006. Meneses became Hackensack&#x27;s first Hispanic mayor when he was sworn in on July 1, 2007, and Melfi took the reins as mayor in 2008. Four of the same five officials were re-elected in 2009 (Townes, Melfi, Sasso, Meneses), along with one opposition candidate, LaBrosse. The city council continued to rotate the mayor&#x27;s seat, with the exception of Labrosse, and Melfi became mayor again in 2012.

Walter E. Nowakowski served as mayor from 1965-1969, Frank Zisa served as mayor from 1977 to 1981, Fred Cerbo from 1981 to 1989, and John F. &quot;Jack&quot; Zisa (son of Frank Zisa) from 1989 to 2005.

Former Assemblyman Charles &quot;Ken&quot; Zisa served as chief of the Hackensack Police Department from his 1995 appointment to replace John Aletta until May 2010 when he was suspended without pay on charges of official misconduct and insurance fraud. Tomas Padilla was appointed the acting police chief while the police department was being monitored by the Bergen County Prosecutors office. In May 2012, a judge ordered Zisa out of his position as police chief, a decision that cost him his police retirement benefits. In January 2013, Mike Mordaga was appointed the new civilian police director, which replaced the previous position of police chief.

<doc id="136888" wikidata="Q1087086" url="?curid=136888" title="Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey">
<text>Ho-Ho-Kus () is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 4,258, an increase of 180 (+4.4%) from the 2010 census count of 4,078, which in turn reflected an increase of 18 (+0.4%) from the 4,060 counted in the 2000 census. The borough is the home of several historical landmarks, including the Ho-Ho-Kus Inn and The Hermitage.

Ho-Ho-Kus was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on October 12, 1908, from what had originally been the borough of Orvil, which was in turn created on March 8, 1905, from portions of Orvil Township.

As of the 2000 census, Ho-Ho-Kus was the 15th-wealthiest community in New Jersey with a per capita money income of $63,594 as of 1999, an increase of 36.9% from the $46,451 recorded in 1989. The borough&#x27;s median household income was $165,827 in 2013. In 2011, &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine named Ho-Ho-Kus the best place to live in the state of New Jersey, citing its affluence, low crime rate and the quality of its school system, as well as its proximity to New York City and other major commercial destinations.

== History of the name ==
The meaning of the name Ho-Ho-Kus has been disputed. From the official history on the borough&#x27;s website, the most likely origin is a contraction of the Delaware Indian term &quot;Mah-Ho-Ho-Kus&quot; (or &quot;Mehokhokus&quot;), meaning &quot;the red cedar&quot;.

Other meanings have been suggested over the years and are listed on the borough&#x27;s website, including: a Lenape word for running water; a cleft in the rock, or under the rock, or hollow rock; the word &quot;hohokes&quot;, signifying the whistle of the wind against the bark of trees; the Chihohokies Indians, whose chief lived here; the Dutch &quot;Hoog Akers&quot; for &quot;high acorns&quot; or &quot;Hoge Aukers&quot; for &quot;high oaks&quot;; the Lenape word &quot;hoccus&quot;, meaning &quot;fox&quot;, or &quot;woakus&quot;, meaning &quot;gray fox&quot;; or that the &quot;Ho&quot; part means joy or spirit, and the rest of the name comes from &quot;hohokes&quot;, referring to a type of tree bark.

=== Ho-Ho-Kus versus Hohokus ===
A constant source of confusion has been the manner in which the borough&#x27;s name has been styled, with each syllable capitalized and separated by hyphens. The confusion is only exacerbated by the existence of Hohokus Township (now Mahwah), which comprised the area of present-day Ho-Ho-Kus and other surrounding communities, yet was styled without the multiple capitalization or the hyphens.

The name &quot;Ho-Ho-Kus&quot; was used explicitly in the resolution requesting a change of name passed by the Borough Council on October 12, 1908, and submitted to the Secretary of State of New Jersey requesting &quot;That the Borough now known as the Borough of Orvil be hereafter known as the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus...&quot;

A few theories have been offered for the hyphens and capitalization. One is that it was intended to differentiate between the borough and Hohokus Township, which was formed on April 9, 1849, and continued to exist until November 7, 1944, when a referendum was passed changing the name to present-day Mahwah. Another explanation was that it was meant to avoid confusion by postal clerks with mail being sent to Hoboken.

While efforts had been made in the ensuing decades to change the name or to alter the way in which the name of the borough is capitalized and punctuated, the borough remains as &quot;Ho-Ho-Kus.&quot;

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 1.75 square miles (4.53 km2), including 1.74 square miles (4.51 km2) of land and 0.01 square miles (0.03 km2) of water (0.63%).

The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Ho-Ho-Kus is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie.

The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

== Education ==

The Ho-Ho-Kus School District serves public school students in pre-kindergarten through eighth grade at Ho-Ho-Kus Public School. As of the 2020–21 school year, the district, comprised of one school, had an enrollment of 597 students and 49.7 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 12.0:1. The school population increased more than 200 students in the decade through 2008.

Local secondary school students in public school attend Northern Highlands Regional High School in nearby Allendale, which serves students in the ninth through twelfth grades grades from Allendale, Ho-Ho-Kus, Upper Saddle River and some students from Saddle River, as part of sending/receiving relationships with the Ho-Ho-Kus district. As of the 2020–21 school year, the high school had an enrollment of 1,364 students and 106.3 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 12.8:1. &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Northern Highlands Regional High School as the 22nd-best high school of the 328 ranked schools in New Jersey in its 2012 rankings of the &quot;Top Public High Schools&quot; after being ranked 6th of 322 schools in 2010. The ten voting seats on the high school district&#x27;s board of education are allocated based on a percentage of the enrollment coming from each constituent municipality, with one seat allocated to Ho-Ho-Kus.

After ending a long-standing sending relationship to Ridgewood High School in the mid-1970s, Ho-Ho-Kus students started attending Midland Park High School. The small size of the Midland Park school and the lack of electives led to efforts in the mid-1990s to find another high school to serve students from the borough. Since then, high school students from Ho-Ho-Kus have been attending Northern Highlands Regional High School. The send / receive agreement between Ho-Ho-Kus and Northern Highlands began in the 1990s. In 2016, the Ho-Ho-Kus and Northern Highlands districts reached an agreement to extend the send / receive agreement through 2026 under a fixed-price contract by which Ho-Ho-Kus would pay $3.6 million for the 2016–17 school year, escalating by 2% a year to $4.3 million in 2025–26, regardless of the number of students from the borough sent to the high school.

Public school students from the borough, and all of Bergen County, are eligible to attend the secondary education programs offered by the Bergen County Technical Schools, which include the Bergen County Academies in Hackensack, and the Bergen Tech campus in Teterboro or Paramus. The district offers programs on a shared-time or full-time basis, with admission based on a selective application process and tuition covered by the student&#x27;s home school district.

The borough is home to the Ho-Ho-Kus Waldwick Cooperative Nursery School.

<text>Leonia is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 9,304, an increase of 367 (+4.1%) from the 2010 census count of 8,937, which in turn reflected an increase of 23 (+0.3%) from the 8,914 counted in the 2000 census. The borough is a suburb of New York City, near the western approach to the George Washington Bridge.

Leonia was formed as the result of a referendum passed on December 5, 1894, from portions of Ridgefield Township. The borough formed during the &quot;boroughitis&quot; phenomenon then sweeping Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone. Portions of Leonia were taken on February 19, 1895, to form the Township of Teaneck.

&quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Leonia the 31st-best place to live in its 2008 rankings of the &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; in New Jersey.

==History==
Leonia&#x27;s original inhabitants were the Hackensack tribe (Ashkineshacky) of Native Americans. The population was about 1,000 before the Europeans settled in the area. At the time of the American Revolutionary War, Leonia was known as part of the English Neighborhood, a name that survives in neighboring Englewood. It was settled in 1668 mainly by Dutch and English farmers, making it one of the oldest communities in the state. A third of the population was African slaves. It was on the western slope of the Palisades, and started as a quiet farming community. Leonia&#x27;s proximity to New York City and its major universities, theaters, and performing venues contributed to its place in the world of art and academics, with many artists and leading thinkers living there in the 20th century.

The local economy that had focused on agriculture underwent economic and cultural growth during the late 19th century, marked by the introduction of train service. Leonia was originally called West Fort Lee. In 1865, J. Vreeland Moore and other town leaders chose the name &quot;Leonia&quot; in honor of American Revolutionary War General Charles Lee, for whom Fort Lee is named.

In 1899, after traveling through Leonia upon arriving in New Jersey by ferry at Edgewater, advertising executive Artemus Ward purchased a large piece of land and established the Leonia Heights Land Company to develop and market housing in the community. His advertising attracted many academics and artists who were drawn to Leonia&#x27;s small size, culture, and location, leading to the town&#x27;s nickname, the &quot;Athens of New Jersey&quot;.

In 1915, Harvey Dunn established the Leonia School of Illustration, fostering the artists&#x27; colony that emerged over the next decade. By the 1930s, it had the highest number of residents per capita in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in America&quot;, and 80% of its residents were college graduates. Transportation through the borough was enhanced by access to ferries and trolley systems, and Leonia became a refuge for many of America&#x27;s most creative thinkers, including five Nobel Prize winners.

For 200 years, one of Leonia&#x27;s two major north-south avenues, Grand Avenue (the other is Broad Avenue), was called the English Neighborhood Road. In colonial times, it served as the main inland route between Paulus Hook, Bergen, and the English Neighborhood. Leonia was a crossroads of the American Revolution and a training ground for American Civil War soldiers.

Historic places in Leonia include the Civil War Drill Hall and Armory and the Cole-Allaire House, constructed around 1765, making it the borough&#x27;s oldest dwelling, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The Vreeland House, constructed in 1786 by Dirck Vreeland and expanded in 1815, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

Leonia celebrates &quot;Leonia Day&quot; annually on the third Sunday in May.

As of the 2023–24 school year, the district, comprised of three schools, had an enrollment of 2,087 students and 191.6 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 10.9:1.

Leonia Middle School with 675 students in grades 5–8 and 
Leonia High School with 814 students in grades 9–12. Students from Edgewater attend the district&#x27;s schools for grades 7–12 as part of a sending/receiving relationship with the Edgewater Public Schools.

Public school students from the borough, and all of Bergen County, are eligible to attend the secondary education programs offered by the Bergen County Technical Schools, which include the Bergen County Academies in Hackensack, and the Bergen Tech campus in Teterboro or Paramus. The district offers programs on a shared-time or full-time basis, with admission based on a selective application process and tuition covered by the student&#x27;s home school district.

St. John the Evangelist School was a Catholic school for students in grades Pre-K–8, operating under the supervision of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark. After 72 years and generations of graduates, it was closed in June 2013.

==Transportation==
===Roads and highways===
, the borough had of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Bergen County, by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.

Route 93 (Grand Avenue) runs north-south for through the center of the borough, connecting Palisades Park and Englewood. Interstate 95 (the New Jersey Turnpike) curves along the borough&#x27;s northern border while U.S. Route 1/9 and U.S. Route 46 briefly enter along the western border with Fort Lee.

Effective January 22, 2018, Leonia officials banned nonresidents from using residential streets (defined as all streets except Fort Lee Road, Grand Avenue, and Broad Avenue) during rush hours. But due to complaints from business owners citing decreased revenues, Leonia officials are reconsidering.

===Public transportation===
NJ Transit bus route 166 provides local and express service from Broad Avenue to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan, and route 182 serves the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal, with local service offered on the 751, 755 and 756 routes.

Rockland Coaches provides service to the Port Authority Bus Terminal on several routes.

The Northern Branch Corridor Project is a proposal to extend the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail to restore passenger train service on the CSX tracks, which offered passenger service decades before and is now used for occasional freight service. NJ Transit&#x27;s plan would include a station in Leonia.

This domestic storyline was later loosely adapted in the 2021 TV series &quot;WandaVision&quot;, although the location was changed to the fictional town of Westview, New Jersey.

==Government==

===Local government===
New Milford is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members, who are elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in November. The borough form of government used by New Milford is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of New Milford is Democratic Michael J. Putrino, whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. Members of the borough council are Council President Frances Randi Duffie (D, 2025), Hedy Grant (D, 2024), Ira S. Grotsky (D, 2023), Lisa Repasky-Sandhusen (D, 2025), Matthew S. Seymour (D, 2023) and Thea Sirocchi-Hurley (D, 2024).

In January 2019, Matthew Seymour was selected from three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipalcommittee to fill the seat expiring in December 2020 that was vacated earlier that month when he took office as mayor.

Democrats took control of the council in the November 2012 general election, as incumbent Austin Ashley won reelection while running mate and former council member Michael Putrino was elected again after having served two previous terms of office. Incumbent Republican Howard Berner and running mate Peter Rebsch, a former council member, fell short.

Celeste Scavetta had been appointed by the Borough Council on January 11, 2011, to fill the vacant seat of Ann Subrizi that expired at the end of 2011 when Subrizi was elected as mayor. Peter Rebsch was appointed in June 2011 to fill the vacant seat of Council President Keith Bachmann, who had resigned from office; Rebsch served until November 2011, when voters chose a candidate to fill the balance of Bachmann&#x27;s term that expired in 2012.

In the November 2011 general election, Democratic incumbent Randi Duffie and newcomers Austin Ashley and Hedy Grant won seats on the council, unseating incumbent Republicans Peter Rebsch and Celeste Scavetta. After counting absentee ballots, Duffie and Grant won the two three-year council seats, edging Republican Scavetta by 10 votes, and started their terms in January 2012. Ashley defeated Darren Drake by 39 votes for the remaining year on the unexpired term of Ann Subrizzi that had been filled on an interim basis by Peter Rebsch, and took office after the election.

The results of the election held November 2, 2010, were a Republican sweep. Republican challenger Ann Subrizi (2,433 votes) ousted 14-year Democratic incumbent, Frank DeBari (2,120). The Republican challengers for Council defeated both incumbents, with Dominic Colucci (2,328 votes) and Diego Robalino (2,285) unseating Democrats Michael J. Putrino (2,210) and Arthur E. Zeilner (2,115). These result gave the Republicans a 4–1 margin, with Ann Subrizi&#x27;s seat on the Council left vacant.

<text>North Arlington is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 16,457, an increase of 1,065 (+6.9%) from the 2010 census count of 15,392, which in turn reflected an increase of 211 (+1.4%) from the 15,181 counted in the 2000 census.

As the site of Holy Cross Cemetery, which has interred almost 290,000 individuals since its establishment in 1915, and with another Jewish cemetery including several thousand more burials, North Arlington has almost 20 times more dead people than living, with more burials than the living population of Newark, the state&#x27;s largest city. Holy Cross has an average of 2,600 interments each year, of which about 65% are burials, with the remainder split between entombment in mausoleums or crypts and burial of cremated remains. Expansion of the mausoleum will bring its capacity to nearly 36,000 interments, with the cemetery&#x27;s total capacity of about 750,000 expected to last past the year 2090. The cemetery covers and was assessed at $185 million, though its non-profit status means that the municipality generates no tax revenue from a property that covers almost an eighth of the borough&#x27;s land area.

North Arlington was ranked eighth by &quot;Money&quot; magazine on its list of &quot;Best Places to Live 2017&quot;, which cited the borough&#x27;s healthy economy, affordable homes and a high quality of life.

==History==

North Arlington was originally part of an area called &quot;New Barbadoes Neck&quot;.

Copper was mined at the Schuyler Copper Mine in present-day North Arlington during the 18th and 19th centuries. It was one of the first true copper mines in North America.

In 1755, the first steam engine in North America was assembled in North Arlington. The Newcomen steam engine was imported from England by John Schuyler to pump water out of his copper mine. He hired engineer Josiah Hornblower to assemble the machinery.

North Arlington was formed by a referendum passed on March 9, 1896, and incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 11, 1896, from area taken from Union Township. It was called North Arlington because it was north of the Arlington section of Kearny, which had been named from the Arlington Station on the Erie Railroad.

North Arlington, together with Lyndhurst and Rutherford, was the site of the EnCap project, an effort to remediate landfills on the site and construct homes and golf courses on top of the cleaned up site. On May 27, 2008, the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission terminated its agreement with EnCap Golf Holdings, the company that had the contract to redevelop the site, after the company had missed targets to clean up the landfills as part of the project.

On November 18, 2015, North Arlington approved plans for FedEx to build a freight distribution facility on a former steel dumping ground on Porete Avenue. FedEx pledged to build a new access road to Porete Avenue from Belleville Turnpike, complete with a signalized traffic light, as part of construction. The company planned to hire 225 people to work at the facility. FedEx planned to complete the building by early 2017.

==Geography==

The borough borders the municipalities of Lyndhurst in Bergen County; Belleville in Essex County; and Kearny in Hudson County.

Route 7 (Belleville Turnpike) occupies much of the border of between Bergen County to the north and Hudson County to the south, with North Arlington on one side and Kearny on the other. The bordering neighborhood in Kearny is called Arlington, from which the name North Arlington is derived. Cemeteries lie along both sides of the route, with North Arlington Jewish Cemetery in Bergen and Arlington Memorial Park in Hudson.

===Local government===
North Arlington is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by North Arlington is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of North Arlington is Republican Daniel H. Pronti, whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. Pronti, who won the 2018 mayoral election, replaced Joseph P. Bianchi on the ballot, following Biaanchi&#x27;s death on October 10, 2018; Bianchi, a volunteer firefighter in the borough, who responded to Ground Zero after the September 11 terror attacks, died of cancer he initially contracted at the site. Members of the North Arlington Borough Council are Council President Mario L. Karcic Jr. (R, 2023), Council Vice President Kirk Del Russo (R, 2025), Donna Bocchino (R, 2023), Lynette Cavadas (R, 2025), Brian A. Fitzhenry (R, 2024) and Allison C. Sheedy (R, 2024).

In January 2019, Kirk DelRusso was unanimously selected from a list of three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2020 that became vacant when Daniel H. Pronti was sworn in to the mayor&#x27;s position.

In January 2015, the borough council selected Brian Fitzhenry from a list of three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the council seat that was vacated by Joseph Bianchi when he took office as mayor; Fitzhenry would serve on an interim basis until the November 2015 election. Republicans swept the November 2015 general election, giving the party full control of municipal government. Brian Fitzhenry and Allison Sheedy were elected to full three-year terms, while Mario Karcic Jr., was elected to fill the balance of Joseph Bianchi&#x27;s council seat expiring in 2016.

Peter Norcia was appointed in February 2013 to fill the vacant seat of Steve Tanelli, who won a seat on the Board of Chosen Freeholders.

==Government==

===Local government===
Northvale is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Northvale is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.
, the mayor of Northvale is Republican Joseph E. McGuire, whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. Members of the Borough Council are Thomas R. Argiro (D, 2023), John M. Hogan (D, 2023), Martin Mattessich (R, 2025), Kara McMorrow (R, 2024), Domenich Menafra (R, 2025), Roy Sokoloski (R, 2024; appointed to serve an unexpired term).

In February 2023, Roy Sokoloski was appointed to fill the seat expiring in December 2024 that had been held by Joseph McGuire until he resigned from office.

In December 2015, the borough council selected Michael Small from a list of three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the seat vacated by Gloria Libby, who had left office earlier that month to follow her employer, Mercedes-Benz USA, which had relocated its headquarters from Bergen County to Atlanta.

In March 2014, Mayor Paul Bazela resigned from office after being convicted of theft in his role as operations manager for the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission, after a jury found that he had used PVSC employees to repair the homes of individuals connected to him. Then-Borough Council President Ed Piehler was chosen to succeed him as acting mayor.
