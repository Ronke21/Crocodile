<text>Richard Stephen Sambora (born July 11, 1959) is an American musician, singer, and songwriter, best known as the lead guitarist of the rock band Bon Jovi from 1983 to 2013. He and lead singer Jon Bon Jovi formed the main songwriting unit for the band. He has also released three solo albums: &quot;Stranger in This Town&quot; in 1991, &quot;Undiscovered Soul&quot; in 1998, and &quot;Aftermath of the Lowdown&quot; released in September 2012.

In 2018, Sambora was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Bon Jovi, and reunited with his former bandmates for a performance at the induction ceremony. That year, he formed the duo RSO alongside Orianthi. After two EPs, the pair released their debut album &quot;Radio Free America&quot; in May.

==Early life==
Richard Stephen Sambora was born on July 11, 1959, in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, the son of Joan (née Sienila), a secretary, and Adam C. Sambora, a factory foreman. Sambora is of Polish descent and was raised Catholic. He grew up in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey, and graduated from Woodbridge High School in 1977. He played basketball in high school; his sophomore team won the 1975 Group 4 State title.

Sambora&#x27;s first instrument was the accordion, which he began to play at the age of 6. He began playing the guitar at the age of 12, following the death of Jimi Hendrix in 1970. From his early days, Sambora was strongly influenced by blues and 1960s rock and roll. His most important influences were Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Johnny Winter, Jimmy Page, Joe Perry, Brian May, George Harrison, Hank Marvin, Dave Davies, Pete Townshend, Ritchie Blackmore, Tony Iommi, Manny Charlton, Bernie Leadon, Don Felder, Joe Walsh, and B. B. King. and he has also cited psychedelic soul singer Janis Joplin as having a big influence on his musical style. Sambora was also influenced by Spanish classical music and began a lifelong love of the Spanish guitar. Classical music directly inspired several of his songs, such as &quot;The Answer&quot; which was originally written on piano.

Sambora also plays many other instruments, such as drums, bass, saxophone, and piano. The first time he performed on stage was at a Catholic Youth Organization dance when he was a teenager.

==Career==
===Early career===
Sambora was a guitarist for the band Message, and with that band put out a 1982 independent record titled &quot;Lessons&quot;. It was re-released in 1995 under the name &quot;Message&quot;, and in 2000 as &quot;Lessons&quot;. He was later in a band, Mercy, which was signed to Led Zeppelin-owned record label Swan Song Records, and then Duke Williams &amp; the Extremes, who were signed to Capricorn Records. Sambora was also in an improvisational club band called Richie Sambora &amp; Friends. He was part-owner of a club in New Jersey, and at age 19 owned his own independent label Dream Disc Records. Sambora&#x27;s first professional tour was as an opening act for Joe Cocker in the early 1980s. Shortly before joining Bon Jovi in 1983, Sambora unsuccessfully auditioned for Kiss, to be Ace Frehley&#x27;s replacement.

===Bon Jovi===

Sambora joined Bon Jovi in 1983, replacing the band&#x27;s original lead guitarist Dave Sabo, who went on to form Skid Row. Alec John Such had been playing in a band with Sambora and joined Bon Jovi while Sambora was away in Los Angeles auditioning for Kiss. When Sambora returned home, Such promptly invited him to see the band play. Sambora was impressed with Bon Jovi after seeing the band perform live, describing the band as &quot;magic&quot;, and he subsequently approached Jon Bon Jovi backstage and &quot;gave him a verbal résumé&quot;. Though Sambora initially believed Bon Jovi was not interested in him, he received a phone call several days later inviting him to rehearse with the band. When Jon arrived and heard the band with Sambora, he hired him on the spot. That night, the pair returned to Bon Jovi&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house and wrote the songs &quot;Come Back&quot; and &quot;Burning for Love&quot;, both of which would appear on the band&#x27;s 1983 debut album.

The song &quot;Next 100 years&quot; from the album Crush, written by Sambora and Bon Jovi, is a self cover. The Japanese version, with lyrics by B&#x27;z&#x27;s Koshi Inaba, was recorded first in 1999 by Johnny &amp; Associates&#x27;s special unit called J-Friends as part of the relief efforts for the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake. The live version of the song was also included in a DVD released in April 2003, &quot;J-FRIENDS Never Ending Spirit 1997-2003&quot;. It included performances from several of the agency&#x27;s groups, as well as by the special unit.

Sambora left the band in 2013 prior to a concert in Calgary during the band&#x27;s Because We Can tour. Since his departure, Sambora has only played with Bon Jovi at their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction in 2018. In 2016, Sambora stated that his reason for leaving the band was in order to give his family more of his attention. &quot;I really needed to take some time to be with my daughter,&quot; he stated &quot;She needed me and I needed her, actually.&quot;

Sambora also released a solo EP with Orianthi, and performed alongside the RSO band member and his girlfriend on April 7, 2018.

===Solo albums===
Sambora&#x27;s first solo album was 1991&#x27;s &quot;Stranger in This Town&quot;, a blues-influenced album that charted at No. 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 20 on the UK Albums Chart. The lead single, &quot;Ballad Of Youth&quot;, reached a high of No. 63 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 59 in the UK. &quot;One Light Burning&quot; was released as the second single and the album titled track, &quot;Stranger In This Town&quot; as the third which charted at No. 38 on the Mainstream rock charts. Eric Clapton played the lead guitar on the promo single &quot;Mr Bluesman&quot;, backed by Sambora on acoustic guitars. Sambora did a short US tour in support of the album, featuring Tony Levin (bass), Dave Amato (guitar), Crystal Taliefero (percussion) and Bon Jovi bandmates Tico Torres (drums) and David Bryan (keyboards). The track &quot;Rosie&quot; was co-written by Jon Bon Jovi and was initially intended for the fourth Bon Jovi album &quot;New Jersey&quot;. It was also released as a promo single in Japan. &quot;Ballad of Youth&quot; was released in the UK in summer 1991 and despite plugs from &quot;The Friday Rock Show&quot; on BBC Radio 1 the song barely skimmed the top 75.

&quot;Undiscovered Soul&quot; was Sambora&#x27;s second solo album, released in 1998. The album was produced by Don Was. The album charted at No. 174 on The Billboard 200 and No. 24 on the UK Albums Chart. The lead single &quot;Hard Times Come Easy&quot; charted at No. 39 on the Mainstream rock chart and No. 37 in the UK, the second single &quot;In It For Love&quot; charted at No. 58 on the UK Singles Chart. The title track &quot;Undiscovered Soul&quot; and &quot;Made in America&quot; were also released as singles. In support of &quot;Undiscovered Soul&quot;, Sambora toured Japan, Australia and Europe in the summer of 1998. The band featured Richie Supa (guitar), Ron Wikso (drums), Kasim Sulton (bass), Tommy Mandel (keyboards), Everett Bradley (percussion; Japan only), Gioia Bruno (percussion; Australia only) and Crystal Taliefero (percussion; Europe only).

In 2001, Sambora had a single for a movie soundtrack &quot;On The Line&quot; which was titled &quot;Take Me On&quot;.

Fourteen years after his previous solo album, Sambora announced via his Twitter page that recording of &quot;Aftermath of the Lowdown&quot; had been completed with hopes that the album would be released in July 2012. Photographs were published of Sambora working in a recording studio. The new album was produced by Luke Ebbin, who produced Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;Crush&quot; and &quot;Bounce&quot; albums. &quot;Aftermath of the Lowdown&quot; was released in September 2012. The album charted at No. 10 on the &quot;Top Hard Rock Albums&quot;, No. 34 on the Top Independent Albums, No. 149 on The Billboard 200 and No. 35 on the UK Albums Chart.

The track &quot;Every Road Leads Home to You&quot; was released as a single for the album and features a music video. The song is also featured as one of the bonus tracks on Bon Jovi&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;What About Now&quot;. A special edition single, &quot;I&#x27;ll Always Walk Beside You&#x27;&quot; featuring Alicia Keys was released as the second single of the album. All the profits from the sale of the special edition single goes to the ongoing recovery efforts of the Red Cross for the devastation from Hurricane Sandy. The track &quot;Sugar Daddy&quot; was released as a promo single and a music video was made for the song &quot;Taking a Chance on the Wind&quot;.

In 2013 following his departure from Bon Jovi, Sambora released the solo single &quot;Come Back As Me&quot;.

Sambora announced in early 2015 that he is working on a new album in collaboration with fellow musician and girlfriend Orianthi. In 2016, they performed as RSO together in Australia, South America, and England, where they opened for Bad Company. In September 2017, RSO released a five-song EP called &quot;Rise&quot; followed by another EP &quot;Making History&quot; which was also released in 2017. The duo released their debut album &quot;Radio Free America&quot; in May 2018.

===Other work===
Sambora composed television theme songs for &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; and &quot;The Insider&quot;. Sambora (along with Jon Bon Jovi) is part of the ownership group of the Philadelphia Soul, an Arena Football League football team.

Sambora is featured on the track &quot;Baby Rock Remix&quot; from LL Cool J&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Exit 13&quot;.

Sambora made a guest appearance on Bo Diddley&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;A Man Amongst Men&quot;, playing guitar on tracks &quot;Can I Walk You Home&quot; and &quot;Oops! Bo Diddley&quot;.

In 1999, Sambora was a guest vocalist on the Stuart Smith album &quot;Stuart Smith&#x27;s Heaven &amp; Earth&quot;, performing a cover of the Deep Purple song &quot;When a Blind Man Cries&quot;. Also in 1999, Sambora played the guitar solo on the track &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Love Me&quot; on the album &quot;Tuesday&#x27;s Child&quot;, by Canadian singer Amanda Marshall.

In 1992 Sambora was on the soundtrack for Red Shoe Diaries with the feverish song “You Never Really Know”. Sambora sang &quot;Long Way Around&quot; for the 1997 Steven Seagal action film &quot;Fire Down Below&quot;. The song, written by Seagal and David Pomeranz, appears in the final scene. In a 1998 interview Sambora said his version is in the film itself but a different person&#x27;s performance of the song is included on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album, despite Sambora&#x27;s name appearing on the album credits. Sambora also recorded the song &quot;One Last Goodbye&quot; for movie &quot;The Banger Sisters&quot;, and covered Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot; for the soundtrack of 1990 comedy &quot;The Adventures of Ford Fairlane&quot;.

In 2004, Sanctuary Records released a self-titled album which had been recorded in 1978 by Shark Frenzy, documenting Sambora&#x27;s first recorded material. The mix tapes had been damaged in a flood and band member Bruce Foster had remastered them for release many years later.

Sambora co-wrote several tracks and played guitar on Australian rock/pop artist Shannon Noll&#x27;s third album &quot;Turn It Up&quot;. It was released in Australia in September 2007.

To coincide with his solo album &quot;Aftermath of the Lowdown&quot;, Sambora and friends performed as the house band on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; on CBS for one week (December 3–7, 2012). Several guests sang along with the band over the week, including Ferguson (singing Sugar Daddy), Denis Leary, Eddie Izzard and even Larry King, who sang the Late Late Show theme song.

Sambora competed on the fourth season of the British version of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as the Jacket Potato.

==Personal life==
Sambora married actress Heather Locklear in Paris on December 17, 1994. Their daughter Ava Elizabeth Sambora, was born on October 4, 1997. Locklear filed for divorce in February 2006 citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized on April 11, 2007. On April 20 2007, Sambora&#x27;s father, Adam, died of lung cancer.

===Alcohol problems===
On June 7, 2007, it was announced that Sambora was entering an undisclosed rehab facility in Los Angeles for treatment related to alcoholism. Following his release, he told an interviewer, &quot;I was just drinking too much and I needed to get my life together. I&#x27;m still in therapy and stuff like that, but it&#x27;s good. I&#x27;m great. I feel fine.&quot; In the Bon Jovi documentary &quot;When We Were Beautiful&quot;, Sambora talks candidly about his addiction to painkillers following a fall in his bathroom. He credited his bandmates and mother with helping him through the difficult time.

On March 26, 2008, Sambora was arrested for drunk driving in Laguna Beach, California where he was a longtime resident. Both his ten-year-old daughter and her 18 year old cousin were in the vehicle. At his May 2008 arraignment, he pleaded no contest &quot;to driving with a blood alcohol level of .08 or higher&quot;, was fined $390, placed on probation for three years, and was required to attend a driver&#x27;s education course.

On April 28, 2011, it was announced that Sambora had made the decision to enter rehab again. He was absent from the band for thirteen shows during the Bon Jovi Live tour, and his guitar and vocal duties were handled by session musician Theofilos &quot;Phil X&quot; Xenidis. This was Sambora&#x27;s second stint in rehab and was announced just a week after he finished probation for drunk driving charges. Sambora returned to join the band in June 2011 in Zagreb, Croatia, for the start of the European leg of the tour.

==Musical style and influences==
From his early days, Sambora was strongly influenced by blues and 1960s rock and roll. His most important influences were Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Johnny Winter, Jimmy Page, Joe Perry, Brian May, George Harrison, Hank Marvin, Dave Davies, Pete Townshend, Ritchie Blackmore, Tony Iommi, Manny Charlton, Bernie Leadon, Don Felder, Joe Walsh, and B. B. King, and he has also cited psychedelic soul singer Janis Joplin as having a big influence on his musical style.

==Public service and recognition==
Over the years, Sambora has raised money for many charities, such as Dream Street, the Steve Young Forever Young Foundation and Michael J. Fox&#x27;s Parkinson&#x27;s disease charity. He has donated money privately to various cancer charities since the death of his father, including both hospitals where his father was treated, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and M D Anderson. Sambora&#x27;s fundraising with the charity Stand Up For a Cure allowed for three mobile full service hospital units to be brought to the streets of New York, two of which were named after his parents, respectively.

In May 2004, Sambora was bestowed with an Honorary Doctorate of Letters by Kean University where he attended the awards ceremony and gave a speech of acceptance. He attended Kean University as a freshman, but dropped out to pursue a career as a professional guitarist and session musician.

Sambora and his songwriting partner Jon Bon Jovi were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 18, 2009.

On November 24, 2009, Sambora launched charitable effort You Can Go Home in his home town of Woodbridge Township, New Jersey, which unveiled a street renamed Richie Sambora Way. He also donated funds to renovate part of his alma mater Woodbridge High School, which opened a new weight room, the Adam Sambora Fitness Center, dedicated to Sambora&#x27;s father.

==Instruments and equipment==
Sambora has been known to use a wide variety of equipment throughout his career. He has an extensive guitar collection, featuring more than 130 instruments, about a third of which are various Fender Stratocaster models.

In the 1980s, Sambora mostly played Kramer, Jackson, Charvel and Hamer superstrats as well as modified and custom Gibson Les Paul models, such as his Rod Schoepfer model. In early-mid 1987, Kramer put out a Richie Sambora signature model with three humbuckers, pointy headstock, gold hardware, star-shaped fingerboard inlays and a Floyd Rose Original locking tremolo. In the early 1990s, Fender put out a Richie Sambora Stratocaster signature model with Floyd Rose locking vibrato and three pickups: a DiMarzio humbucker at the bridge, and two single coil Texas Special pickups, one at the neck and one at center.
In 2000, Taylor started the production of a Richie Sambora signature model, a six-string acoustic made of koa wood, called the RSSM. Only 100 were made. All of his double-neck acoustics feature a six-string neck on top and a 12-string neck on bottom, opposite of normal. Sambora&#x27;s guitar solo in the song &quot;Bullet&quot; from the 2009 album &quot;The Circle&quot; was played through a Dunlop Cry Baby wah pedal. In 2010 he said that he was keeping his vintage guitars at home for studio work, and bringing his less expensive guitars on the road to his concerts, including &quot;some Strats, a few Teles, some Les Pauls and Les Paul Juniors&quot; along with a number of Richie Sambora signature models made by ESP Guitars. Other notable guitars in Sambora&#x27;s collection include the Kramer Jersey Star, Gibson SG Junior, Gibson ES-335, Gibson Firebird, Gibson Flying V, Gibson Explorer, Martin guitars, Ampeg Dan Armstrong Plexi, Ovation, Taylor and Fender Telecaster double neck guitars, and an Ovation triple neck guitar.

<text>Parker is a city located in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is in the extreme northwestern portion of the county. The population was 695 at the 2020 census. The city was named for Judge John Parker, a lead surveyor of Lawrenceburg and founder/owner of Parker&#x27;s Landing, the two villages combined to create Parker.

Parker is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Smallest City in the USA&quot;. Parker was incorporated as a city on March 1, 1873, by special state legislation in the midst of the northwestern Pennsylvania oil boom. The new municipality was called &quot;Parker&quot; and made up the earlier villages of Parker&#x27;s Landing (on the Allegheny River) and Lawrenceburg (on the bluff above the river). Residents assumed that Parker would quickly become a major population center, and at the height of the oil boom, the population of Parker grew to over 20,000. The boom quickly went bust, however, and by the 1880s the &quot;city&quot; returned to its historic small village size—a population of approximately 1,000.

Parker received national attention again in 2014 when a massive ice jam along the Allegheny River formed and started some minor flooding. The jam was so massive that it attracted tourists to the area, and a local bar even named a drink after the ice jam. The ice jam was severe enough that the National Weather Service issued a flood warning for the area in case the ice started melting.

<text>Worthington is a borough in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 594 at the 2020 census. 

==History==
Worthington was laid out on a tract of land called Mt. Lorenzo by Judge James Barr in 1843–1844. He chose the location due to the nearby junction of two important early stage coach routes, the east–west route from Indiana, Pennsylvania, to Butler, and the north–south route from Freeport to Emlenton. It was incorporated as a borough in 1855. As the village grew into a town it variously relied upon farming and light manufacturing for its income. During the 1970s most manufacturing ceased. Agriculture is still important to the region, and a few light tool and die firms survive. The region also features coal, natural gas, and mineral extraction. In the 19th century an iron furnace and woolen mill were the main industrial operations, both owned and operated by Peter Graff I.

The town&#x27;s first settlers were a mix of eastern Pennsylvanians and newly arrived immigrants of Scotch-Irish, German and English background. Other ethnic groups would arrive in the early 20th century in small numbers. Other later industries included tile block and clay drain pipe manufacturing, aluminum ladder and specialty tool and die production, limestone mining, and underground mushroom farming. The town hosts four Protestant churches, a community park, several civic organizations (including a public library), and a community center and municipal complex housed in the former Junior/Senior High School. The fire hall serves both Worthington borough and West Franklin Township. 

The joint municipalities of Worthington borough and West Franklin Township (which includes the former villages of Craigsville, Yellowdog, and Laird&#x27;s Crossing) have cooperated in many areas including public utilities (water and sewage), and both municipalities are often colloquially referred to as Worthington - sharing the same zip code of 16262. The former high school is actually located outside of Worthington borough and was officially called Worthington-West Franklin Jr./Sr. High School. The mascot for the school was the Bison, and the school colors were green and white. The school closed around 1984, and the students began attending Kittanning High School, which also closed in 2015 (along with Ford City and Elderton high schools) in order to form Armstrong High School.

Worthington P.O. appears in the 1876 Atlas of Armstrong County, Pennsylvania.

<text>Aliquippa is a city in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 9,238 at the 2020 census. It is located northwest of Pittsburgh and is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

Formerly the location of a large Native American trading center, Aliquippa grew to become a center for steel manufacturing by the early 20th century, similar to other towns in the area. With the closure of most large employers by the 1980s, Aliquippa has since become an economically distressed community.

==History==
Aliquippa was founded by the merger of three towns: Aliquippa, Woodlawn, and New Sheffield. There is no known direct connection between Seneca Queen Aliquippa and the city; rather, &quot;Aliquippa&quot; was one of several Indian names selected arbitrarily by the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad in 1878 for stations along its route. The oldest church within the current boundaries of Aliquippa is Mt. Carmel Presbyterian Church (formerly White Oak Flats Presbyterian Church), established about 1793 in the New Sheffield region on Brodhead Road. 

Aliquippa is best known as the location of a productive steel mill that the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company constructed there along the Ohio River beginning in 1905. Employment at the facility sustained a population of 27,023 in 1940. The mill closed in 1984 during the collapse of the steel industry during the 1980s, and was demolished in 1988. This major economic loss alongside suburbanization caused a major population loss through the end of the 20th century. Many of the city&#x27;s businesses have left since the closing of the mill. This has left the city economically depressed, with the crime rate dramatically rising over time.

Aliquippa was formally chartered as a city in 1987 by the Aliquippa Borough Council. The B.F. Jones Memorial Library is a historical landmark of the community.

USAir Flight 427 crashed near Aliquippa on September 8, 1994.

<text>Ambridge is a borough in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States. Incorporated in 1905 as a company town by the American Bridge Company, Ambridge is located 16 miles (25 km) northwest of Pittsburgh, along the Ohio River. The population was 6,972 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The town is near the location of Legionville, the training camp for General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne&#x27;s Legion of the United States. Wayne&#x27;s was the first attempt to provide basic training for regular U.S. Army recruits and Legionville was the first facility established expressly for this purpose. The Harmony Society first settled the area in the early 19th century, founding the village of &quot;Ökonomie&quot; or Economy in 1824. Although initially successful, accumulating significant landholdings, the sect went into decline. By the end of the 19th century, only a few Harmonists remained. The society was dissolved and its vast real estate holdings sold, much of it to the American Bridge Company, who subsequently enlarged the town and incorporated it as Ambridge in 1905.
American Bridge attracted thousands of immigrants who came to fulfill their dreams of work, freedom, and peace. The steel mills became the focal point of the town. Most of the employees were relatives of relatives and the small town grew, with wards separating the town into ethnic sections. In addition, many of the ethnicities had their own church, club, and musical group that sought to give immigrants a familiar place to be as well as to preserve their culture. Many were from Eastern and Southern Europe including Italian, Greek, Slovak, Croatian, Ukrainian, Polish, Slovene, and Carpartho-Rusyn, to name a few.

With the growth of the steel mills, Ambridge became a worldwide leader in steel production. The borough became known for bridge building, metal molding, and the manufacture of tubes (large iron pipes). During World War II, the American Bridge Company fabricated steel for the building of LSTs (Landing Ship Tanks). The steel was then sent by rail to the adjacent American Bridge naval shipyard in Leetsdale, Pennsylvania, where the LSTs were built. The area was also home to several other steel mills like Armco, the pipe mill which manufactured oil piping, and A. M. Byers, a major iron and tool fabricator. Eventually competition by foreign steel producers began to cause the share of the steel market for U.S. manufacturers to dwindle. With the shift of steel production overseas, the American Bridge Company ended operations in Ambridge in 1983. The legacy of American Bridge can be seen today in bridges around the world.

The decline of both the steel industry and the town is chronicled in &quot;Rust Belt Boy&quot; by Ambridge native Paul Hertneky.
With Ambridge now over 100 years old, revitalization is beginning to occur along Merchant Street in the Downtown Commercial District. Entrepreneurs and investors have begun to renovate the Victorian facades of the commercial storefronts. Antique shops are opening in the Historic District, which is also a National Historic Landmark, and a once industrial warehouse area is being converted to condominiums, shops, and parks. In 2007 Ambridge was designated as a Preserve America Community by the White House. Convenient to Pittsburgh along the Ohio River Boulevard and just across the Ohio River from the Pittsburgh Airport, Ambridge leaders hope it will benefit by its location and low cost of living.

Diversity in food, music, and entertainment continues to unite the community in remembering its origins. Organized by the Ambridge Chamber of Commerce, the three-day Nationality Days festival takes place in May and is located in the heart of the downtown Commercial District. Vendors line the center of Merchant Street as thousands of attendees – locals and tourists – enjoy Italian, Ukrainian, Greek, Polish, German, Croatian, and Slovenian cuisine. Booths are sponsored by numerous churches in Ambridge, bringing with them the recipes for their cultural dishes such as pirohy, haluski, stuffed cabbage, and borscht. Live entertainment, arts and crafts, and children&#x27;s activities are also available. Thousands visit this festival daily (located on Merchant Street from 4th Street to 8th Street).

===Old Economy Village===
Ambridge is the home of Old Economy Village, a National Historic Landmark administered by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. The site interprets the Harmony Society, one of America&#x27;s most successful 19th century Christian communal societies. Old Economy Village also provides public education and preservation of the society&#x27;s unique material culture. Founded by George Rapp, it was the third and final location of the Harmonites. Established in 1824, Old Economy - known to the Harmonites as &quot;Ökonomie&quot; - was founded upon German Pietism, which called for a higher level of purity within Christianity. Soon the Harmonites were not only known for their piety, but also for their production of wool, cotton, and silk. As a pioneer in the American silk industry, Economy became known as the American silk center in the 1830s and 1840s. Today, the site maintains seventeen carefully restored structures and gardens that were built between 1824 and 1830. The buildings reflect the unusual lifestyle of the organization, which, by the 1840s, was renowned for its economic success in textile production. The site also portrays the community&#x27;s involvement with agricultural production, railroads, and oil. The recreated gardens encompass more than , providing colorful 19th century flowers. The gardens&#x27; formal pathways, stone pavilion, and seasonal flowering hedges are among the striking features. Old Economy&#x27;s buildings, grounds, library, archives, and 16,000 original artifacts are fused to create an interpretive facility for the Commonwealth.

==Education==
Ambridge is served by the public Ambridge Area School District, which operates five schools: Economy, Highland and State Street elementary schools (grades PK–5); Ambridge Area Junior High School (grades 6–8), and Ambridge Area High School (grades 9–12). High school students may choose to attend the Beaver County Career and Technology Center for training in the construction and mechanical trades.

Ambridge is also home to Trinity School for Ministry, an evangelical seminary in the Anglican tradition.

<text>Beaver is a borough in, and the county seat of, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located near the confluence of the Beaver and Ohio rivers, approximately northwest of Pittsburgh. As of the 2020 census, the population was 4,438.

==History==

The area around Beaver was once home to Shawnee Indians, who were later displaced by groups such as the Mingoes and the Lenape. It was part of the Ohio Country that was in dispute during the French and Indian War.

Beaver became the site of Fort McIntosh, a Revolutionary War era Patriot frontier fort. After the war, the fort was the home of the First American Regiment, the oldest active unit in the US Army. The fort was abandoned in 1788 and razed a short time later. By then, the frontier had moved westward and there was no further need for a permanent garrison to protect the area.

The community was laid out in 1792. In 1800, it became the county seat of the newly formed Beaver County. The first county court was established in Beaver in 1804. Growth was steady until 1879 when the arrival of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad caused a major growth spurt. In February 1884 a massive flood caused extensive damage. In 1974, an archeological excavation was conducted at the site of Fort McIntosh. The borough became a Tree City USA community in 1997.

Robert Linn was the mayor of Beaver for 58 years, from 1946 to 2004, making him one of the longest-serving mayors in the United States. In late 2007, local officials proposed the consolidation of Beaver with Brighton Township, although nothing came of the initiative.

==Geography==

===Beaver Historic District===

In 1996, almost the entire community was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. Centered on Beaver&#x27;s commercial Third Street, the buildings in the Beaver Historic District date primarily to the nineteenth century, although some twentieth-century structures are present. Some of the district&#x27;s most prominent buildings are five churches and the county courthouse, although most of the district consists of residential neighborhoods. Included in the boundaries of the district is the Matthew S. Quay House, the National Historic Landmark home of Beaver native Senator Matthew Quay, and the site of Fort McIntosh, a fort constructed in the 1780s.

===Library===
The Beaver Area Memorial Library started as a small collection of books in the basement of the Beaver Trust Co. in the 1940s and was run by the Beaver Civic Club. It eventually moved into the basement of a former high school on College Avenue in Beaver. In 1948, the Beaver County courts granted a charter for the official formation of the Beaver Memorial Library. A fundraiser was started in Beaver County in 1961 to raise the $130,000 to build a new establishment. The new building, which continues to serve as the public library today, was officially dedicated on April 8, 1962, and open to the public.

<doc id="131248" wikidata="Q1130843" url="?curid=131248" title="Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania">
<text>Beaver Falls is a city in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 9,005 at the 2020 census. Located 31 miles (50 km) northwest of Pittsburgh, the city lies along the Beaver River, six miles (9 km) north of its confluence with the Ohio River. It is a part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==

The area of present-day Beaver Falls was first mentioned in 1770 in the journals of David Zeisberger, a Moravian Church missionary who eventually settled in present-day Lawrence County. A Lenape chief named Pakanke took Zeisberger to the valley surrounding the Beaver River, where the Lenape owned a large tract of open land which Zeisberger was given access to. In April 1770, Zeisberger and his followers set out in 16 canoes down the Allegheny and Ohio rivers, reaching the mouth of the Beaver three days later. They made their way up to what was called the “Falls of the Beaver,&quot; where they encamped. Early settlers included Dr. Samuel and Milo Adams around the upper falls, whilst David Hoopes and Isaac Wilson developed the middle falls. The town originally formed around the middle falls area was named Brighton after Brighton, England, which was the hometown of the area&#x27;s surveyors.

Despite early promise through the canal business on the falls, the town fell behind neighboring New Brighton after repeated poor economic periods. The earlier proprietors sold the land to the Harmony Society in 1859. The Harmonists immediately brought in surveyors to re-plan Brighton, laying out a town twice the size of the original, paving several main streets with brick and officially changing the name of the community to Beaver Falls. The rapid revitalization of the community allowed it to gain borough status on November 9, 1868. In the 1870s, Beaver Falls was home to a Chinatown and had up to 225 Chinese residents, brought in to work at Beaver Falls Cutlery Company moved in to the borough by the Harmonists.

On May 31, 1985, an F3 tornado hit just north of the city as it went across northern portions of Beaver County, as part of the 1985 United States–Canada tornado outbreak.

The population declined nearly 50% between 1940 and 2000, which is attributed mostly to its central location in the Rust Belt.

<text>Center Township is a township in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 11,649. It is a suburban community located approximately northwest of Pittsburgh. It is home to two colleges, Penn State Beaver and Community College of Beaver County. Center Township is also a retail center for Beaver County, home to the Beaver Valley Mall.

==History==
Prior to colonial explorers, native Indians traveled the &quot;Glade Path&quot;, an important trail crossing the future township from north to south. One family of settlers in Beaver Valley, the Bakers, made their home in 1774 in the hills above Raccoon Creek near what is now Pleasant Drive in Center Township. At that time, all lands south of the Ohio had been claimed by Virginia, with the seat of government at Pittsburgh. During the course of the Revolutionary War, Fort McIntosh was constructed at Beaver to aid settlers in defense against the Indians and the British at Detroit. Supplies were brought from Pittsburgh along the old Indian path. The trace was renamed Brodhead&#x27;s Road, after the commander of Fort McIntosh.

When Beaver County was formed in 1800, three townships were created on the south side of the Ohio River: Hanover, First Moon and Second Moon. Later (in 1812) the area was reorganized into four townships. One of the townships created was Moon, the predecessor of Center. Over the years, several communities would split from Moon, including Raccoon Township in 1837, Phillipsburg Borough in 1840 (now known as Monaca), and Potter Township in 1912.

In 1914, a serious dispute among Moon Township residents split the township, separating the heavily populated suburban section in the north from the much larger sparsely populated region in the south and west. On November 24, 1914, after an election, the court decreed that the larger southern section be known as Center Township. Eighteen years later, in 1932, the remaining portion of Moon in the north was annexed by Monaca, becoming that borough&#x27;s Fourth and Fifth Wards, now known as Monaca Heights and Colona Heights, respectively. 

In early November 2003, the largest hepatitis A outbreak in American history occurred due to contaminated green onions at the defunct Chi-Chi&#x27;s Mexican restaurant in the Beaver Valley Mall in Center Township. There were at least 660 confirmed cases, and four deaths.

<text>Conway is a borough in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States, located along the Ohio River. At the 2020 census, the borough had a total population of 2,168. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Conway is the site of the Conway Yard, a major railroad classification yard and locomotive facility owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway. From 1956 until 1980, it was the largest rail yard in the world.

==History==

The area that would become Conway was first settled by former American Revolutionary War General John McKee, an Irish immigrant, around 1800 through an 800-acre grant of New Sewickley Township. The area had formerly been known as Crow&#x27;s Run Valley by several tribes of Native Americans because of the abundance of crows that nested in the Hemlock trees of the region. McKee&#x27;s land extended in to the forest about from the Ohio River.

In 1825 McKee sold 230 acres of his land to Michael Conway, a fellow Irish American. McKee then used the funds to help finance the construction of the first railroad between Pittsburgh and Beaver County, which would later become a branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The Conway Yard was built in 1884 by the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway, a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad. It was expanded in the early 20th century, and again in a massive effort in the 1950s, which made it the largest railway yard in the world for some time. Apart from the railroad, other industries flourished in the production of clay, coal, oil, building stone, brick making and building railroads, primarily through the various endeavors of James I. Park and his sons William A., John H. and George I. Park.

A post office, originally known as Agnew, was created in 1881. The borough was incorporated as Conway on June 3, 1902, with Addru Bepler serving as the town&#x27;s first mayor.

<text>Fallston is a borough in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Beaver River. The population was 259 at the 2020 census. It is a part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
Fallston takes its name from a waterfall in the Beaver River. It lies on the west side of the Beaver River immediately opposite New Brighton, Pennsylvania and about a mile below Beaver Falls. The narrow space between the hills on either side and the Beaver River was dammed at the lower falls; the water power allowed Fallston to achieve great importance as a manufacturing center. The &quot;Harris&#x27;s Pittsburgh Business Directory&quot; for the year 1837 states &quot;This place and the surrounding neighborhood, bids fair to be extensively increased, in consequence of the immense mineral and water advantages which it possesses.&quot;

The borough of Fallston, the largest manufacturing center of its time in Beaver County, was incorporated by an Act of the Assembly in 1829. A post office at Fallston was established June 25, 1829.

On August 5, 1835, the &quot;Fallston and Brighton Gazette&quot; newspaper started publication in Fallston, one of the earliest newspapers in the county. It was not able to sustain itself, and ceased publication in November 1836. The &quot;Beaver Falls Union and Beaver County Advocate&quot; was the Gazette&#x27;s successor, starting publication in January 1838; when it published its last on March 2, 1839, the &quot;Western Argus&quot;, which started publication in 1818 elsewhere in Beaver County, attempted and was mainly successful in taking over the &quot;Advocate&quot;&#x27;s readership. It continued publication for more than 86 years (with various changes in name and management over the years).

In 1836, brothers Matthew T. Kennedy (1804–1884) and Samuel Kennedy (1810–1886), sons of Thomas Kennedy (1782–1821), an Irish-born wheel and spinning-wheel maker, went into business building cabinets and doing wheelwright work carried on by water power. The business later changed into a nail keg, and still later into a lead keg, factory. Their business was successful and in 1876, the Kennedy brothers established a second plant in New Brighton, Pennsylvania. The business was carried on by the founders&#x27; descendants until the 1930s.

On October 1, 1836, a contract for building a covered wooden bridge over the Beaver River at Fallston was awarded to Lathrop &amp; LeBarron. The bridge opened in 1837, and was heavily traveled. Once the bridge was opened, nearly all the manufacturing was done on the Fallston side, with most of the owners of the concerns living on the opposite side of the Beaver in New Brighton. The covered bridge stood in place until February 6, 1884, when flooding on the Ohio and Beaver rivers inflicted extensive damage in low-lying areas and swept it away. A fine iron bridge replaced the lost covered bridge and was still in use until February 2015.

==Geography==
Fallston is located at (40.719732, −80.310006).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and (8.00%) is water.

<text>Freedom is a borough in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 1,496 at the 2020 census. It is located northwest of Pittsburgh and is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Originally founded as a steamboat building town, chief industries later included the production of oil, caskets, and monuments.

==History==
In 1824, the Harmony Society returned to Pennsylvania from Indiana. The society settled in what is now Ambridge, five miles (8 km) up the Ohio River. One of the reasons the society left Indiana was because of harassment for their abolitionist activities. Their settlement was in Beaver County, along the Ohio River. There they founded &quot;Ökonomie&quot;, now better known as Old Economy Village. Here, the Society gained worldwide recognition for its religious devotion and economic prosperity. 

The Harmonites were abolitionists, and began placing signs along the Ohio River with one word, &quot;FREEDOM&quot;. The area of the present-day borough of Freedom began to be called such on maps of the Ohio River used by the steamboat navigators.

The community of Freedom was founded in 1832 by Jonathan Betz and Stephen Phillips, co-owners of a steamboat building business. They purchased about of land for $2,000.00 from General Abner Lacock. The original village was surveyed and plotted by Simon Meredith. All of the lots, streets and alleys were located with special preference to the steamboat-building business, the only business at the time. Later, an additional were purchased from Captain William Vicary for $2,500.00. Vicary himself retained some property in the area, including a stone house; today, the house remains a local landmark, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

About 150 people first located in Freedom and it grew rapidly. The town was laid out on a Tuesday and by the following Saturday, fourteen houses had been built. In 1833, Freedom contained 40 dwellings, 47 families, and about 320 people. Boat building and distilling were its two main businesses.

By 1837, Freedom had grown to a population of about 600, and 100 dwellings. New businesses included a foundry, and steam engines manufactured by J. Baker and Company, a large steam sawmill, and an extensive distillery and gristmill owned by J. Stahl and Company. The merchants at that time were: Phillips and McConnell, Stile and Fisher, Phillip Bentel, John Donnan, J. W. Mead, three innkeepers: Samuel Furnier, J. W. Snead, and Thomas G. Kerr and two physicians: Drs. William Smith and T. F. Robinson.

In 1896, the neighboring borough of Saint Clair was absorbed by Freedom. Saint Clair Borough was located in what is currently Freedom&#x27;s second ward. It was laid out by Captain William Vicary and was often simply called Vicary or Vicary Extension.

<text>Georgetown is a borough in western Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 208 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Little Blue Run Lake, the U.S.&#x27;s largest coal slurry waste impound, is located next to the town.

==History==

The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other groups of Native Americans. The first known Europeans to enter the region were French explorers/traders during the 17th century.

Christopher Gist was one of the first English colonists to survey the Ohio River Region around present day Pittsburgh in 1751. George Washington would also survey the area in 1753 as an envoy to demand the French to vacate the territory, which the British had claimed, as land disputes were occurring between British and French colonies at the time. Hostilities broke out in 1754 which triggered the French and Indian War.

In 1763, the region became British territory after a War with France. The Province of Pennsylvania gained control of the land through an Indian treaty in 1768.

After the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783, settlers began to move into western Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh and further west by way of the Ohio River. The area around Georgetown was known to riverboat travelers west of Pittsburgh as a &#x27;last chance&#x27; stopping place for food and supplies, before entering into the roughly-charted and dangerous Northwest Territory, (there was an ongoing Indian War in the territory at the time). The closest place of protection was Ft. McIntosh, (in modern-day Beaver), about 20 miles east of the Pennsylvania border line.

The town as it is today was laid out by Benoni Dawson January 13, 1793, and named &#x27;Georgetown&#x27;. One theory suggests the name was bestowed in honor of George Dawson, his son. Another theory suggests the town was named in honor of the new U.S. President George Washington, who surveyed the Ohio River area years earlier. 
Settlement was slow due to hostilities with the Native Americans until General Wayne&#x27;s Treaty of Greenville in 1795. In 1800, Georgetown would be part of the newly formed Beaver County, surrounded by several townships. The first post office in Georgetown was established in 1802, including its first hotel.

In 1803, in preparation for the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Meriwether Lewis had a keelboat built near Pittsburgh, with plans to sail it down the Ohio River and meet up with William Clark in Kentucky to begin the Expedition. Lewis and his crew stopped at Georgetown to buy a canoe to replace one that was leaky. Lewis later discovered the new canoe also leaked. In 1812 the nearby Mill Creek was used to power mills to grind grain into flour. The first church was built in 1814, St. Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church. Georgetown remained a river town for keelboats and later steam boats, until the expansion of railroads and oil drilling after the Civil War.

==Geography==
Georgetown is located at (40.641172, −80.500037).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and (33.33%) is water.

==Industry==
Georgetown is a rural agricultural area, just outside the major steel industries of Pittsburgh. Nevertheless, Georgetown is still close to heavy industry with potential hazards. In the 1970s the Little Blue Run Lake, the country&#x27;s largest coal slurry waste impoundment, formed as a large artificial lake south-west of Georgetown (on the Pennsylvania and West-Virginia state lines). Because of its large toxic pollution content, the facilities closed down in 2016.

Georgetown is a couple miles downstream from old J &amp; L steel mills and other metal facilities such as ATI Allegheny Ludlum, Marathon Petroleum and the Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Plant.

==Education==
Children in Georgetown are served by the South Side Area School District. The current schools serving Georgetown are:

<text>Midland is a borough located along the Ohio River in western Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 2,433. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Founded in 1906, it was initially a company town surrounding the Crucible Steel Company&#x27;s Midland Works.

==History==

Native American petroglyphs exist in the area surrounding Midland, including on Babbs Island, the Little Beaver Creek, and Shippingport Bridge.

In 1905, Pittsburgh agent T. K. Miller purchased land on behalf of a group of industrialists who would form the Midland Steel Company and with it, the borough of Midland as a company town in 1906. Other companies would begin operations in the town as well. In 1911, Midland Steel Company sold its operations to the Pittsburgh Crucible Steel Company, a division of the larger Crucible Steel Company of America. By the end of the First World War, Crucible employed 2,700 men.

The contraction of the American steel industry in the 1960s and 1970s forced layoffs at the Crucible plant and a decline in the borough&#x27;s population. During the 1980s, the American Iron and Steel Institute reported that more than 200,000 steelworkers in the U.S. had lost their jobs, and more than 400 mills and plant divisions were closing, including Crucible&#x27;s Midland plant. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel bought the Midland plant and merged with Republic Steel to form the LTV Steel Corporation, which went bankrupt in 2001, accelerating the decline of the borough&#x27;s economy.

==Geography==
Midland is located in western Beaver County at (40.638273, −80.452455).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and , or 9.13%, is water.

Pennsylvania Route 68 (Midland Avenue) is the main street through the community, leading east into Industry and west to Glasgow and the Ohio border. Pennsylvania Route 168 joins PA-68 along Midland Avenue through the center of town but splits off to the south to cross the Ohio River via the Shippingport Bridge, and climbs out of the river valley to the north via Fairview Road.

===Surrounding and adjacent neighborhoods===
Midland has two land borders, with Industry to the northeast and Ohioville to the northwest. Across the Ohio River to the southeast, Midland runs mostly adjacent with Greene Township with a short alignment with Shippingport to the southwest.

==Education==
Midland is served by the Midland Borough School District. The current schools serving Midland include Midland Elementary/Middle School (grades K–8), Beaver Area High School (grades 9–12, part of the Beaver Area School District), and alternatively, Lincoln Park Performing Arts Charter School (grades 7–12) and Midland Innovation + Technology Charter School (grades 9-12). 

Lincoln Park is the only school serving grades 9 through 12 in the borough, despite being a charter school with admissions requirements. Until 1985, Lincoln High School operated within the borough. In 1985, the school board voted to close Lincoln Junior-Senior High School. With only 150 students in grades 7 through 12, they could no longer afford to operate the school. The district made two failed attempts to merge with neighboring Western Beaver County School District, once in 1965, and again in 1985. First, the district entered into a 5-year tuition agreement with the Beaver Area School District from 1985 to 1990. In 1990, an agreement was reached to bus students 8 miles to East Liverpool High School in East Liverpool, Ohio, where they attend 9th through 12th grades and graduate. These were the only Pennsylvania public school students attending a facility in another state. In February 2015, East Liverpool notified the Midland Borough School Board of its intention to end the agreement. High school students once again attend Beaver Area High School.

Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School, an online school, bases its operations out of Midland.

<doc id="131280" wikidata="Q1186675" url="?curid=131280" title="Monaca, Pennsylvania">
<text>Monaca ( ) is a borough in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 5,625 as of the 2020 census. It is located northwest of Pittsburgh and is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

First incorporated in 1840 as Phillipsburg as the home of the New Philadelphia Society, its name was changed to Monaca in honor of the Oneida leader Monacatootha. Fire clay is found in large quantities in the vicinity, and there is a Stölzle Glass plant in the town.

==History==

===Early settlements===

Monaca has a history dating to the 18th century. The land on which it stands was granted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by patent, bearing the date September 5, 1787, to Colonel Ephraim Blaine (1741–1804), who served in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, was commissary-general of the Northern Department from 1778 to 1782, and was James G. Blaine&#x27;s great-grandfather. In the patent, this tract was called &quot;Appetite&quot;. On August 1, 1813, the land was bought by Francis Helvidi (or Helveti, Helvedi, Helvety), described as a Polish nobleman exiled from his native country who immigrated to America. Helvidi, who may have been the first white settler in Monaca, bought the large &quot;Appetite&quot; tract and raised sheep on it, but his venture was unsuccessful. Harmony Society leader George Rapp, one of Helveti&#x27;s creditors, complained in 1815 &quot;about the risk Helvety is taking with the sheep,&quot; and in 1821, the property was sold at Sheriff&#x27;s sale to Rapp.

In 1822, the beginnings of a town appeared when Stephen Phillips and John Graham purchased the property and established their &quot;extensive boat yards&quot; on the Ohio River there. It was first named for Phillips, and was long known as Phillipsburg. Phillips and Graham built numerous steamboats, including the &quot;William Penn&quot;, which carried the Harmonites from their second settlement in New Harmony, Indiana, to Beaver County and their third and final home at Economy. In 1832, Phillips and Graham sold the entire tract of land to seceders from the Harmony Society at Economy, and moved their boatyards to what is now Freedom. The seceders from the Harmony Society were led by Bernhard Müller, known as Count de Leon. The group consisted of German immigrants who formed a communal religious society. In 1832, after leaving Economy with about 250 former Harmony Society members, Müller and his followers started a new community in Phillipsburg (now Monaca) with the money they obtained in the settlement with the Harmony Society. There they established the New Philadelphian Congregation, or New Philadelphia Society, constructing a church, a hotel, and other buildings. They soon renamed this community &quot;Löwenburg&quot; (Lion City). Perhaps because of ongoing litigation and other financial problems, Müller&#x27;s group sold its communal land in Pennsylvania in 1833. Some community members stayed in Monaca, while others followed Müller and his family down the Ohio River on a flatboat. A number of those who followed Müller and his family ended up at the Germantown Colony near Minden, Louisiana. But many stayed in Monaca, and not long after Müller and his followers left, a new religious speaker, William Keil, showed up in the area in the early 1840s. Keil was able to attract some followers who were former Harmony Society/New Philadelphia Society members, and his group eventually moved away and settled the communal town of Bethel, Missouri, in 1844, and Aurora, Oregon, in 1856. But a number of former Harmony Society/New Philadelphia Society members stayed in Monaca. In 1840, the area was incorporated as the &quot;Borough of Phillipsburg&quot; from the Moon Township site. The first burgess was Frederick Charles Speyerer, and the first council Edward Acker, Jacob Schaffer, Henry Jung, George Forstner, and Adam Schule.

===Mid- to late 1800s===

Edward Acker established a &quot;Watercure Sanatorium&quot; in Phillipsburg in 1848, and in 1856 when the borough&#x27;s first post office was established, it took the name &quot;Water Cure&quot;. In 1865, Reverend William G. Taylor bought the Sanatorium buildings for his Soldiers&#x27; Orphans Home. The Home, according to one of the students, consisted of a &quot;dormitory, dining room, schoolhouse, bathhouse, woodshed, carpenter shop and a two-acre playground.&quot; It burned in 1876. There is a historical marker near the point where Fourth Street meets Route 18 that reads: &quot;Water Cure Sanatorium founded 1848 by Dr. Edward Acker. Used hydropathy or water to heal. First hospital in Beaver County. Town&#x27;s first post office, 1856. Phillipsburg Soldiers Orphans School founded 1866 by Rev. William Taylor. Destroyed by fire 1876. Beaver County Historical Research &amp; Landmarks Foundation&quot;.

Thiel College was founded in Monaca in 1866, and moved to Greenville five years later. A historical marker on Fourth Street reads: &quot;Site of Thiel College endowed by A. Louis Thiel and founded in 1866 as Thiel Hall by Rev. William Passavant. Chartered in 1870 as Thiel College of The Evangelical Lutheran Church with Rev. Henry W. Roth as first president. Moved to Greenville, Pennsylvania, 1871. Beaver County Historical Research &amp; Landmarks Foundation&quot;.

In 1892, the borough&#x27;s name was changed from Phillipsburg to Monaca in honor of the Native American Indian Monacatootha (also known as Scarouady). Monacatootha (&quot;Great Arrow&quot;) was an Oneida warrior chief and a representative of the Iroquois Confederacy with the authority to supervise affairs among the Delawares and Shawnees in that area. He had met with future U.S. President George Washington in Logstown. He was a strong friend of the English and campaigned against the French.

===Modern era===

In the borough&#x27;s history, manufacturers made tons of enameled porcelain ware, glass, tile, tubing, drawn steel and wire. Today, Stölzle Glass USA (former Phoenix Glass/Anchor Hocking Plant #44) is in Monaca.

In 2003, Monaca was the epicenter of one of the most widespread hepatitis A outbreaks in the United States, which afflicted at least 640 people and killed four in northeastern Ohio and southwestern Pennsylvania. The outbreak was blamed on tainted green onions at a Chi-Chi&#x27;s restaurant in the town.

In March 2012, Royal Dutch Shell announced its intention to study and build a multi-billion-dollar ethane cracker complex near Monaca to produce ethylene from abundant Marcellus shale natural gas in the area. It would be the first such unit built in the northeastern U.S. utilizing natural gas obtained from hydraulic fracturing as feedstock. In June 2016, Shell Chemical Appalachia committed to build the Shell Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex at the former Horsehead Corporation zinc site near Monaca in Potter Township.

==Geography==

Monaca is located at (40.683966, −80.276986), on the south side of the Ohio River.

===Surrounding and adjacent neighborhoods===
Monaca has only one land border, with Center Township to the south and west. Across the Ohio River, Monaca runs adjacent with (from west to southeast) Beaver, Bridgewater, Rochester, East Rochester, Freedom, and Conway.

Two bridges cross the Ohio River from Monaca: the Rochester–Monaca Bridge carries Pennsylvania Route 18 into Rochester, and the Monaca–East Rochester Bridge carries Pennsylvania Route 51 into East Rochester. A third bridge, the Beaver Bridge, carries rail tracks owned by CSX Transportation from Monaca into Bridgewater.

==History==

===Early history===
The first written records tell of the coming, by horseback and on foot, of white settlers to the vicinity about 1800. A large proportion of these were young married couples from eastern Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the north of Ireland. Something not generally known is that slavery once existed in Beaver County. In 1800 there were four slaves; in 1810 there were eight; in 1820 there were, five and in 1830 none: all having been liberated by law. In 1808 the state conveyed to Joseph Chapman a tract of land consisting of 386 acres. The plot was known as Chapman&#x27;s Hall and was so named in the deed. Chapman later sold his land to James Nicholson, who came and brought from the south three colored slaves, Pompey Frazier, Tamer Frazier and Betty Mathers. Mr. and Mrs. Nicholson by deed dated May 6, 1819, conveyed to these three servants, who had so faithfully served them, the farm on which they resided. The deed, however, not to be in effect while either Mr. or Mrs. Nicholson lived. Ten years after the date of the deed Mr. Nicholson died. Shortly after Tamer Frazier also died. Pompey Frazier and Betty Mathers continued to live with Mrs. Nicholson until her death, when they became the owners of the farm. Pompey Frazier died without offspring and Betty Mathers became sole possessor of the property. Meanwhile, she had married Henry Jordan, a fiddler, in 1840 and had several sons and daughters. She sold the land and upon it the greater part of New Galilee has been built. Betty Mathers Jordan died in 1872. The stream which flows through New Galilee is named for the Jordan family &quot;Jordan&#x27;s Run&quot;. . The original homestead of Betty Mathers and her husband Henry Jordan was located at 709 Washington Avenue, next to the post office. ..[5] This location is now the museum of the New Galilee Historical Society and residence of the curator William Bittner.

===Founding and incorporation===
In 1854 the question was raised as to what to name the village. The citizens, most of them devout Christians, said that, &quot;As the small stream that flows through the village is called Jordan&#x27;s Run, why not name it New Galilee as Galilee means beyond Jordan&quot;. Application was made at the June 1867 session of court for the rights of incorporation. The application was signed by P. L. Grim, Robert Porter, J. B. Johnson, W. Thompson, John Acheson, W. D. Eakin, John Graebing, R. E. Hudson, Dr. R. J. Britain, and twenty-two others. The degree was granted January 15, 1868. The first election was held &#x27;the third Friday of the following March, at which J. S. Hudson was judge, and W. D. Eakin and John Acheson were inspectors. The village was surveyed and platted June 13 and 14, 1876, by James Harper, County Surveyor. The northerly streets were to be Washington and Centennial Avenues. The easterly ones were to be Jackson. Jefferson, Monroe, and Madison.

===Industries===
Some industries have flourished in New Galilee. From 1860 to 1875 the Harmony Society operated two coal oil mills, one which was among the largest of its kind in the United States. It stood on the site of the Pennsylvania Railroad depot. A cooper shop was established in 1863 by Henry Donaldson. In 1865 Anthony Smith came from New York and started a second cooper shop. In 1902 the Beaver Clay Company, manufacturers of brick and clay products located in New Galilee.

===Beaver Clay Manufacturing Co.===
The Beaver Clay Mfg. Co. was incorporated in 1902, and its first plant was erected the same year. In that year, the company began manufacturing paving bricks. Shortly after the paving brick facilities were operational, the company made plans to manufacture face bricks. In 1915, the company made plans to improve its operations at a cost of over $100,000. Michael Baker was the lead engineer on the improvement project. The Beaver County clay company was awarded contracts with the U.S. government during World War I, which would help bolster its output to 30-36 million bricks in 1919. The company was purchased by the New Castle Refractories Company in 1935. The New Castle Refractories Co. purchase the plant in order to manufacture refractories for hot tops that were used in the open-hearth steel industry.
Eventually, the New Castle Refractories was absorbed by the Pittsburgh Refractories Company. Today, the property is occupied by E.J. Bognar, Inc., which is still in operation today.

===Mining===
Clay was an abundant resource in Beaver county. According to the 1955 circular of the Pennsylvania Geological Survey, In 1955 Beaver County produced 13.7% of Pennsylvania&#x27;s total clay output. There were 13 companies that mined clay in Beaver county at that time. Two of these companies, The Negley Fire Clay Co. and Ralph A. Veon, Inc. mined fire clay of the plastic variety from open pits and marketed the output for use in manufacturing fire brick and block, foundries, and heavy clay products. In addition, Ralph A. Veon, Inc., mined and sold fire clay of the burley variety. In 1955, New Castle Refractories mined stoneware clay from an underground mine near New Galilee for use locally in manufacturing pouring channels

==Churches==
There are three churches located in New Galilee: The Galilean United Presbyterian Church and The New Galilee Church of the Nazarene and St. Ann&#x27;s Church which were erected in 1895, 1908 and 1924 respectively. With the exception of St. Ann&#x27;s the churches continue to hold services. .

A lot was soon donated on Washington Avenue and a small church was erected and then dedicated on the weekend of January 25–26, 1908. The Reverend C. N. Cain served as the first pastor of the Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene of New Galilee, although the word &quot;Pentacostal&quot; was dropped in 1919.

==Attractions==

===Annual Gilkey Potato Festival===
New Galilee is the birthplace of the &quot;Gilkey&quot; Potato. The Gilkey Potato was first brought into Pennsylvania in 1797 by John Gilkey. Starting in Lawrence County, John Gilkey started planting three different varieties of potatoes- red, white and blue. These three potatoes quickly cross pollinated to create a new potato, which he named &quot;Neshannock&quot;, after a small creek nearby. This new type of potato quickly became popular among local farmers for its productivity and better quality in taste. By 1875 this new potato was prized by Americans from Philadelphia to San Francisco. By later in the nineteenth century, the Neshannock had become the standard commercial potato of the United States.

Recently, New Galilee celebrated its history with the 2014 New Galilee Potato Festival. Beginning in 2013, a circus troop was included among the festivities.

===New Galilee Community Park===
The New Galilee Community Park is situated south east of the intersection of PA Route 168 and PA Route 351. The park was dedicated on July 2, 1978, by the fireman of The New Galilee Volunteer fire department. The park property which includes 19 acres was purchased from the New Galilee VFD on December 3, 1997, for $20,000.

===New Galilee Historical Society===

==Landmarks and memorials==

===Veterans memorial===
In 1969, the city council earmarked $300 to erect a monument. The council planned for the monument to be placed on a triangular lot bordered by Centennial, Washington and Maple Street belonging to Jack Walsh. Leading up to 1976, the town council had planned to place the veterans memorial on property owned by the fire hall due to its cost effectiveness. The council was dissuaded when a petition of over 150 signatures asked that the memorial be placed on the Walsh site.

In August 2018, plans were made to renovate the memorial property with the removal of a blue spruce tree, several large ewe shrubs and the brick bollards along the road. The council intends on installing a small pavilion.

<text>Ohioville is a borough in western Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,349 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
Ohioville was originally Ohio Township, formed in 1805 from parts of South Beaver Township. The region had, in years past, been home to numerous tribes of Native Americans, most notably the Archaic and Woodland periods, of Iroquionian extraction. Prior to William Penn&#x27;s arrival in eastern Pennsylvania, the Iroquois tribe of the Five Nations used the region for hunting.

Ohio Township was once home to a ferry run by Maryland native Thomas Smith. This ferry transported passengers from the north side of the Ohio to the south, and back again. Near the ferry, a spring of &quot;bituminous oil&quot; arose that would play a crucial role in the township&#x27;s development. At one time there were also several Indian pictographs. (These are currently underwater.)

===Early communities===
Blackhawk village was a small community on the South Beaver Township line. Its first post office was established sometime after 1837. Even earlier, the New Salem United Presbyterian Church was established circa 1798, around the same time as Big Beaver&#x27;s Mount Pleasant Church.

In 1811, Four Mile United Presbyterian Church was founded. Located on Tuscarawas Road (whose name derives from the old Tuscarora hunting trail), the church was originally named Four Mile Square Church.

In 1816, Ohio Township lost some of its territory to Brighton Township. With the establishment of Glasgow borough (1854), Industry Township (1856), and Midland borough (1906), even more land was lost.

In 1960, Ohio Township was incorporated as Ohioville Borough.

<text>Rochester is a borough in central Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States, at the confluence of the Beaver and Ohio rivers. Located northwest of Pittsburgh, it is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The population was 3,472 at the 2020 census. 

Like many towns around Pittsburgh, Rochester was a former industrial hub, home to the H. C. Fry Glass Company, and was a major junction on the Pennsylvania Railroad. Rochester has been a background for films, including the 1986 movie &quot;Gung Ho&quot;, the 1996 movie &quot;Kingpin&quot;, and the 2000 movie &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;.

==History==

What eventually became Rochester was originally a Lenape village called Sawcunk. The area was settled in 1799 in what was then the American frontier by white settlers and was known as East Bridgewater, Fairport, and Beaver Point. The borough adopted the name Rochester in 1834 when a local businessman who did regular business in Pittsburgh decided to christen his home with the name Rochester so he could have a unique name to stamp his goods; the borough was officially incorporated as such in 1849.

Many of the streets that run through Rochester today had different names based on wild animals. Virginia Avenue and Adams Street—two of the city&#x27;s main thoroughfares via Pennsylvania Route 68—were once known as Fox Lane and Tiger Lane, respectively. Deer Lane, which still exists today, is the last remnant of the original naming scheme for the street grid in the borough.

Rochester is where Henry Clay Fry and his associates formed a glass manufacturing company following Fry&#x27;s return from the American Civil War. In 1897 the Rochester Tumbler Company (as the company was known) became the National Glass Company of Rochester. The company helped to introduce pressed glass production to America, pressing the glass into a mold where previously the technique of cut glass had been to blow it by hand. At its height, the National Glass Company of Rochester employed over 1000 people but its bankruptcy during the Great Depression began a long decline in the town&#x27;s population which continues up to today.

Rochester was a railroad junction for the Pennsylvania Railroad and sat along the railroad&#x27;s mainline from the Eastern United States to Chicago.

<text>West Mayfield is a borough in northern Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,195 at the 2020 census. It is a part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
The authoritative written history of West Mayfield comes from Edith Porter&#x27;s &quot;West Mayfield History&quot;, reprinted here from &quot;Milestones&quot;, Vol. 27, No. 1, Winter 2002.

At the founding of Beaver County, the Borough of West Mayfleld was part of South Beaver Township. In 1816, it came within Chippewa&#x27;s bounds upon founding of that township. In 1887, the land passed into the newly formed White Township. Around this time, the site known as Mayfield was little more than a station on the Pennsylvania Railroad. The station stop took its name from a farm up on the hill known as Mayfield Cottage. West Mayfield, then, was the area west of the station stop. It had areas too. The Oakville area centered around the present Rock Avenue just southwest of 37th Street. Another section was known as West Park. These names survive in the vicinity today in the name for a school, West Park; the name of a part of Route 251, Oakville Road; and the name of the community, West Mayfield. Its increasing industrialization and the need for more and better schools led to the split from White Township and its incorporation in 1923.

Most of West Mayfield lies along the north and south of a long, steep hill called 37th Street, part of Route 251. To the south is a hollow which was once part of the Harbison farm and coal yards. Before the industries began, there were only the farmlands of the Whites, Edwards, Harbisons, Ridings, Waggoners and Schuttes, about a dozen houses and a little schoolhouse. Thirty-seventh Street was a narrow dirt road traveled by a few buggies and wagons in the summer and in the winter by a similar number of sleds and sleighs. When it snowed, the young people of College Hill and Geneva College had bobsled parties on the road.

Most of the names we have found among the early settlers were English. John White, credited with being the first settler, came to this area about 1792-93 under the &quot;Settlement and Improvement Act of 1792&quot;. He came from County Antrim, Ireland. John Edwards appears to have bought land from John White on 37th Street hill, now part of West Mayfield. He was born in Wales and came to this area sometime after 1852. Other prominent names in West Mayfleld which appear to be English, Irish or Scotch are Scranton, Patterson, Portman, Calhoun, Ridings, Garvin, and Goe, Schutte and Gumph are evidently German names. Rouzer, Keller, Ohnsman, Smith, McConnels, Patterson and Ridings were instrumental in forming the charter for the township as it broke away from White Township.

The Edwards School, a one-room red brick structure, was built about 1880 on land donated by the Edwards family. John Edwards had come to Pittsburgh from Wales when he was a young boy. He worked on the canal along the Beaver River. He worked in the gold fields of California for a year and returned to buy a farm on 37th Street hill. The Edwards School building also served as a community meeting house and as an auditorium for lectures and other programs. At the end of each school year it hosted the annual picnic for the school children and their families. The Edwards home was a welcome stop for sledders to share warmth, refreshments and hospitality. The information seems to indicate that the Edwards School had replaced the White Schoolhouse since it was, in the 1880s, &quot;the only school for miles around.&quot; It served the area for many years. A &quot;News-Tribune&quot; article of August 30, 1924, announced that forty pupils were expected to take up their studies in the Edwards School under Miss Leiper on September 2, the opening day of school. The school administration was still under White Township, even though they had split away the previous year, according to the &quot;News-Tribune&quot; item. That year, 1924, the three teachers at the West Park building were Mr. Balph, and the Misses Anna Birnnisser and Florence Garvin, with the enrollment expected to be between 105 and 110.

The West Park building was begun in 1919 with four classrooms. A &quot;News-Tribune&quot; article of December 23, 1930, announced the laying of the cornerstone for the new West Mayfield School (to be named Liberty School). It would house grades 1–3, and West Park School grades 4–6. It is presumed that the Edwards School continued in use as a Community Building for a time, since the Volunteer Fire Department used it as a meeting place until they were able to use the borough building. A two-story and partial basement addition to the West Park School was completed in 1959. Ten years later, in the fall of 1969, a one-story addition was occupied, and the Liberty School was no longer required for classrooms. It has become the West Mayfield Municipal Building. The enrollment at West Park has declined from a projected 255, in the Long Range Developmental Program of the Blackhawk District, (1970), to about 155 for the 1980–81 school year. Previously, secondary education was available in the Beaver Falls schools; when the borough became a part of the Highland jointure, students could attend the Highland Junior High and Northwestern High School, or they could choose to go to Beaver Falls. Since the borough is now a part of Blackhawk School District, students continue in Middle School at Highland and attend the four-year Blackhawk High School on Blackhawk Road.

St. Philomena Catholic Church serves the West Mayfield community, though it is located just outside the borough boundaries. It has a parish school, begun in 1958. One grade was added each year until eight grades were provided in September 1964. Present enrollment is about 130, and many of the students come from the community of West Mayrfield.

A Christian School was established in West Mayfield in 1978. It has grades K–12 and an enrollment of about 60. It is housed in the West Mayfield Community Church, now listed in the phone book as the West Mayfleld Bible Baptist Church. The congregation began from the need for Christian teaching for children in the West Mayfield Housing Project in 1948. From a group of children in Sunday School classes in the community building of the project, the attendance grew, and a congregation formed which was known as the West Mayfleld Reformed Presbyterian Mission. They separated from the affiliation with the Reformed Presbyterian denomination and were chartered in 1962 as the West Mayfleld Community Church. They began their building in 1967 on property located on lower High Street.

The Church of the Living Christ is located on Rock Avenue near 37th Street. It is a small chapel, built here in 1910, in the Oakville area, to conduct a Mission Sabbath school. A permanent Christian Association, under the College Hill Reformed Church, was formed for this congregation. It continued until about fifteen years ago when Ken Engle purchased the building from the College Hill Reformed Church for the purpose of holding Boy Scout meetings. It served the Boy Scouts for ten years until the present congregation purchased the chapel from Mr. Engle. They have held services here for the past five years.

Early industries in the area included a scale works and a key works, and coal was mined in Harbison Hollow. Large scale industrial development began in 1899 with the move into the present West Mayfield of a tube making industry, now Babcock &amp; Wilcox Company, Tubular Products Division. Other manufacturers followed; present ones include Mayfleld Foundry, maker of castings for the local mills and manufacturer of heritage articles of early American Colonial days, and Standard Steel Specialty Company, maker of elevator guides and other products.

As the new tube mill was built, there was a need for homes and workmen and their families, so the farms gradually became subdivisions. As the plant expanded, more and more homes were needed. It is a fairly densely populated area, as contrasted with Chippewa, Darlington, or South Beaver townships. West Mayfield probably has more families of different ethnic backgrounds than any other areas as well. As industrial needs increased, people from many walks of life sought employment in the borough. It had the highest proportion of rentals in the Blackhawk District in 1970, but with the increasing number of apartments in both Chippewa and Patterson and the increase in new homes built in West Mayfield, the percentage has probably changed in the past ten years. The area is .66 square miles, and it has a population of about 2,200.

West Mayfield is fairly close-knit, in terms of community spirit. They have an active Volunteer Fire Department, and the school has enjoyed the support of a fine Parent-Teacher Organization. The P.T.O. has contributed much to the library, school equipment and furnishings, school programs and activities, including field trips. Most of the youngsters participate in various Little League ball clubs with much support from the community. The &quot;Hollow&quot; is West Mayfleld&#x27;s main recreational facility. It is the community park in Harbison Hollow. An extensive flat area features three ball fields, basketball and tennis courts, picnic shelters and playground equipment. It is the site of the annual school picnic. Teachers and children walk to the park. Bordered by the wooded hillsides, it is reminiscent of the way it might have been at the Edwards School a hundred years ago.

<text>Bedford is a borough, spa town, and the county seat of Bedford County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It is located west of Harrisburg, the state capital, and east of Pittsburgh. Bedford&#x27;s population was 2,865 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The area around Bedford was inhabited by Euro-American traders during the late 1740s and early 1750s. Permanent settlers, however, did not arrive until after Forbes Road was constructed in 1758 to support the Forbes Expedition&#x27;s campaign against Fort Duquesne.

In 1758, the British Army under General John Forbes arrived at the location of John Ray&#x27;s trading post to establish Fort Bedford, which served as a supply depot along the line of fortifications between Carlisle and the Forks of the Allegheny River. The fort was named after John Russell, the 4th Duke of Bedford. Some believe that the town later took its name from this fort. Fort Bedford was one of a series of British Army outposts leading west from Carlisle to the Forks of the Ohio, which had been claimed by the French, who had constructed Fort Duquesne to control fur trading in the Ohio Valley and along the Mississippi River. During the American Revolutionary War, Fort Bedford served as a refuge for settlers fleeing raids by Indigenous groups.

There is a popular myth that Fort Bedford was captured by American rebels, James Smith&#x27;s &quot;Black Boys,&quot; ten years before the American Revolution, making it the &quot;first British fort to fall to American rebels.&quot; However, this claim is inaccurate. The British Army had already abandoned the fort in 1766, following the conclusion of Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion, whereas Smith&#x27;s raid occurred in 1769. During the raid, a group of men attacked a pack train, seizing weapons and other goods intended for trade. These men were imprisoned, prompting Smith and his followers to attack the fort, which was guarded only by local settlers. The attackers freed the prisoners and seized additional firearms before departing. In his memoirs, Smith sought to portray himself as a figure akin to Robin Hood.

in 1766, John Lukens laid out the village of Bedford, which was formally incorporated on March 13, 1795. Due to administrative issues, the town had to be re-incorporated in 1816.

Fort Bedford eventually fell into ruin. In 1958, a structure modeled after one of the fort&#x27;s blockhouses was built and now houses the Fort Bedford Museum. The original fort, which stood to the east of the museum, was not reconstructed.

In 1794, President George Washington mustered 13,000 Federal troops near Bedford to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion, which was sparked by a tax on whiskey. The troops are believed to have assembled near Jean Bonnet Tavern, four miles west of Bedford, while Washington himself used the Espy House in Bedford as his headquarters. The rebellion mainly involved farmers who argued that transporting whiskey was more economically viable than transporting grain. The uprising escalated, leading Washington to act decisively to ensure that federal laws were upheld. One historian later remarked, &quot;It was at Bedford that the new federal government was finally to establish itself as sovereign in its own time and place.&quot;

During the 19th century, Bedford County became well-known for its medicinal springs, leading to the development of three resorts: Bedford Springs, Chalybeate Springs, and White Sulphur Springs. The Bedford Springs Resort, established in 1806 by Dr. John Anderson, became particularly popular for its &quot;healing waters.&quot; The resort offered several types of mineral springs and attracted visitors seeking cures for various ailments. President James Buchanan used Bedford Springs as his &quot;summer White House,&quot; and it was there that he received the first trans-Atlantic cable message from Queen Victoria on August 17, 1858. In 1855, the resort also hosted the only U.S. Supreme Court hearing ever held outside of Washington, D.C.

The Chalybeate Springs Hotel was another prominent destination for affluent visitors during the 19th century. Notable guests of the Bedford Springs and Chalybeate Springs hotels included Presidents William Henry Harrison, James Polk, Zachary Taylor, Rutherford B. Hayes, and Benjamin Harrison, as well as Thaddeus Stevens and other notable figures.

U.S. Route 30, also known as the Lincoln Highway, passes through Bedford. Prior to the opening of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1940, U.S. Route 30 was the primary east-west route connecting Philadelphia to the west. In 1927, a coffee pot-shaped building, originally a diner, was constructed by David Koontz in Bedford. This unique landmark was relocated to the Bedford County Fairgrounds in 2003.

The Bedford Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

The event includes many vendors, touring of the fort, the Children&#x27;s Theater, pony rides, and an antique car show. There is also a crowning of a Fall Foliage Queen every year. This program lasts for about four months where nominees from all of the high schools in the area compete and participate in various events in hopes of winning the scholarship money. Each year there are three winners who each receive scholarship money to help with their future endeavors.

The Bedford County Fair takes place annually in July or August. Alongside a classic midway of rides, games, and food vendors are a multitude of 4-H-sponsored events (including animal shows and livestock auctions), automobile racing, demolition derbies, and a petting zoo.

<text>Everett is a borough in Bedford County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,765 at the 2020 census.

Everett&#x27;s original name was Bloody Run, after a creek that was the site of a battle between settlers and Native Americans. The town was renamed in honor of Massachusetts politician and orator Edward Everett.

==History==
In 1787, Michael Barndollar purchased the land in this area, and laid out a town which was originally called Waynesburg.

This name was never widely used and this small village was incorporated as a borough in November 1860, to be known as Bloody Run. While this name carries with it many interesting stories and much history, the name was changed in February 1873 to Everett.

The Everett Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

==Geography==
Everett is located in eastern Bedford County at (40.014049, -78.373202). It is bordered on the south by the unincorporated community of Earlston.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

Located in a valley of the Allegheny Mountains, Everett sits within a natural transportation corridor where the Raystown Branch of the Juniata River has carved a water gap, called The Narrows, through Tussey Mountain. The Alleghenies are a sub-region of the much larger Appalachian Mountains, and cover an area of central Pennsylvania, western Maryland and northern West Virginia. The countryside surrounding Everett is composed mainly of large forested areas, extensive agricultural fields, pasture, small villages, and woodlots.

U.S. Route 30 bypasses the borough along its northern edge. The highway&#x27;s former route, the Lincoln Highway (now US-30 Business), passes through the center of town as Main Street. Interstate 76, the Pennsylvania Turnpike, passes just south of the borough but does not provide access, with the nearest exits being Bedford to the west and Breezewood to the east.

Pennsylvania&#x27;s longest hiking trail, the Mid State Trail, passes directly through the center of town, before continuing on towards nearby Rainsburg.

<text>Hyndman is a borough in Bedford County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 863.

==History==
The first known settler in the area was Samuel Waters, who lived near Wills Creek and built a bridge across it before 1800. Around 1800, Jacob Burkett and Amos Raley started a boatbuilding business at the settlement called Bridgeport. Boats were needed to float grain down to Cumberland, Maryland. In 1850, Enoch Cade opened a store, and in 1865 a one-room school was opened. Samuel Miller began laying out a town on his land north of the creek.

In 1871, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad first came through the town, going from Cumberland to Pittsburgh, and the Bedford and Bridgeport Railroad was built from Mt. Dallas (near Everett) to Cumberland. In September 1877, the town was incorporated, and in December of that year the town was renamed Hyndman in honor of the B&amp;O&#x27;s Connellsville Division Railroad Superintendent E. K. Hyndman. The first elected officials were Chief Burgess S. M. Wilhelm and Council members J. W. Madore, W. S. Mullin, Samuel Miller, and Henry Miller. Early industries included the manufacturing of bricks and limestone.

In 1889, the National Bank of South Pennsylvania was opened in Hyndman, but failed in 1905. It was purchased by J. J. Hoblitzell, giving it the name it has today – Hoblitzell National Bank. In 1892 the Hyndman Water Company was completed, in 1893 the electric plant opened, the telephone exchange was begun in 1906, and in 1927 a fire company was organized.

A major fire in late December 1949 burned out Hyndman&#x27;s business center – mostly of frame building construction – before it was brought under control. In August 2017, a 33-car train derailment sparked fires that resulted in evacuation of most of the town&#x27;s residents for several days.

==Geography==
Hyndman is located in southwestern Bedford County and is surrounded by Londonderry Township.

The borough sits in the valley of Wills Creek, which breaks through Savage Mountain and Little Allegheny Mountain to the west and turns south at Hyndman to flow towards Maryland. Little Wills Creek joins Wills Creek in the eastern part of the borough. Wills Mountain rises to the east.

<text>Manns Choice is a borough in Bedford County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 316 at the 2020 census.

==Name==
In 1848, Congressman Job Mann pressured to have a post office at an unnamed village in Harrison Township. The Post Office Department approved the new post office, but as the village had no name, Congressman Mann was to give it one. Before he did so, postal maps were made with the temporary designation &quot;Mann&#x27;s Choice&quot; written on it. The name was never changed, and became the permanent and official one.

==Geography==
Manns Choice is located in west-central Bedford County at (40.002836, -78.591440), in the valley of the Raystown Branch of the Juniata River. Buffalo Mountain and Wills Mountain rise to the east. The borough is mostly surrounded by Harrison Township, but it is bordered by Napier Township to the northwest.

Pennsylvania Routes 31 and 96 pass through the borough. Route 31 leads northeast to U.S. Route 30 west of Bedford, while Route 96 heads south to Hyndman and to Cumberland, Maryland. Route 31 and 96 together head northwest out of town, Route 96 leading to Shawnee State Park and Schellsburg, and Route 31 leading eventually to Somerset. Interstate 76, the Pennsylvania Turnpike, passes just north of the borough limits but does not provide access; the nearest exit is in Bedford.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which , or 1.02%, is water.

Manns Choice town center still preserves its historical watering trough once used to water the horses pulling traveling stages on their way across &quot;the glades&quot;, now Glades Pike, to Fort Pitt, now Pittsburgh. It has chiefly been an agricultural community since its settlement following the Revolutionary War. The town&#x27;s farms and forest were once a land grant offered to German mercenary Hessian Jägers paying loyalty to General George Washington&#x27;s infantry.

Prior to its settlement, the area was home to the Shawnee and Monongahela native tribes. The tribes inhabited the area&#x27;s many small creeks, river banks and meadowlands. They groomed a well balanced permacultural environment which still exists on thousands of surrounding acres of state forests, parks and farmlands today.

Today, the primary industry is still agriculture. Of its many farms, Horn O&#x27; Plenty Farm and Freshtaurant is noted for pioneering innovative agricultural practices and markets that have influenced the region, reassuring confidence for the future of farmers.

The historic White Sulphur Springs Hotel is located south of the borough in Harrison Township. Built in 1884, the building originated as a hotel and restaurant, and is now home to the non-profit ministry of Officers Christian Fellowship, which serves military servicepeople and their families as a retreat center. In the fall, winter and spring off-season, the facility operates as a conference center for churches, business meetings, banquets and day gatherings.

It is home to the Coral Caverns, which house the world&#x27;s only fossilized coral reef, open to the public since 1932.

<text>Rainsburg is a borough in Bedford County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 141 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Rainsburg takes its name from Conrad Rain, its first inhabitant who lived in a round log building and arrived some time before 1786, when he was joined by Captain Jacob Adams and his wife Loretta Dustimer. The Adams arrived from Loudoun County, Virginia following Jacob&#x27;s service during the Revolutionary War with the 7th Virginia Regiment. Jacob built the first hewed-log house in Rainsburg. (That hewed-log house would be replaced by Samuel Williams with a frame house in 1854).

Also among the first settlers in Rainsburg was James Donahoe, who arrived sometime before 1800 and operated a tannery, store, and hotel. Over time, additional merchants arrived in town including Elias Gump who arrived in 1818 from Frederick County, Maryland, to operate a carpentry business and became justice of the peace. Elias&#x27;s relative John Gump, also came and opened a tannery - eventually purchasing Donahue&#x27;s tannery as well. By 1825, there were approximately a dozen houses in Rainsburg, which continued to grow to obtain borough status in 1856.

Notably, Rainsburg was home to the Allegheny Male and Female Seminary, founded by Samuel Williams, who arrived in Rainsburg in 1844 and raised funds to establish the school by selling 138 shares of stock with a par value of $25. The school, often referred to as Rainsburg Seminary, was chartered in 1853 by the Pennsylvania State Legislature with trustees Jacob Barndollar, George Slicer, J. W. Crawford, A. C. James, W. S. Cunningham, George Bortz, Elias Gump, C. Graham, and Williams. A Methodist-affiliated institution, the school was very successful for a short time. However, as most of its students came from the South and national tensions soared in advance of the Civil War, the school encountered serious retention problems. Upon the outbreak of the Civil War, the students from Maryland and Virginia withdrew, and others enlisted in the military. The school was then closed, and the property was sold by the sheriff sometime after 1867. In 1875, the community school moved into the seminary building, which later housed the Independent Order of Odd Fellows Lodge #730. The seminary building, which is now a residence, features a pedimented gable end with fanlight and cupola above as well as a one-story full-facade porch over the seminary&#x27;s entrance. The window in the second story&#x27;s central bay features four-pane surrounds in contrast to the double-sash, six-over-six windows throughout the rest of the exterior. The interior features a broad central solid oak staircase, which reaches to the small octagonal louvered belfry.

In addition to the seminary, Rainsburg features a high number of churches for its population size. It is the only town in Central Pennsylvania to have had church buildings for each of the Methodist Episcopal Church (ME), Methodist Episcopal Church, South(MES) and Methodist Protestant Church (MP) denominations. While each denomination shared a circa 1810 union log structure, but one-by-one they gradually erected their own structures. The first MP Cove church was erected in 1837, expanded in 1842, and replaced by the present building in 1870. The first ME stone church was erected in 1849, and the present brick building in 1878. In 1875 the MES congregation purchased a stone school building, which still stands to the right of the ME building, and worshiped there until erecting their frame church building in 1877. They sold the stone building in 1883 and the frame building in 1888, when it became known as Patriot’s Hall.

Throughout its history, Rainsburg has been home to several churches, stores, hotel, carriage manufactory, tannery, grist mill, and over 50 private residences. Rainsburg&#x27;s original post office counter and mailboxes, previously located in the former Shipley Store, can be viewed today at the General Store &amp; Post Office of the Bedford Village Archeological Site in nearby Bedford. Rainsburg and the Friends Cove valley in which it lies have long been home to a large number of Pennsylvania Germans including Lutheran, German Reformed, and Mennonite communities. Mennonite farms and businesses are still present in the town and surrounding area.

<text>Saxton is a borough in Bedford County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 726 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Saxton is located in northwestern Bedford County at (40.214584, -78.245241), at the northern edge of an area known as the Broad Top in the Appalachian Mountains. Saxton is located in Woodcock Valley, along the Raystown Branch of the Juniata River. Known as &quot;The River&quot; locally, it supplies the town with a secondary source of drinking water. It flows into Raystown Lake just north of town. Saxton Mountain is a small, sharp ridge which rises above the town to the east, behind which is the Broad Top plateau. Approximately mile to the west of Saxton is Tussey Mountain, which runs south to north.

Saxton is bordered to the west by the unincorporated community of Stonerstown. Pennsylvania Route 913 passes through Saxton, leading west through Stonerstown and across the Raystown Branch to end at Pennsylvania Route 26, and leading east to Broad Top City atop the plateau. Via PA-26, it is south to Everett and north to Huntingdon.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Saxton has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Saxton was once a thriving town of several thousand people. Officially founded in 1855 by James Saxton, the area now known as Saxton has been inhabited for centuries. Before Anglos arrived, Native Americans camped along the river that flows through the area. As the United States grew and pushed the frontier west, a few settlers began building homesteads, farms, and mills throughout the valley that Saxton is located in. The region being rich in bituminous coal, a railroad was soon built to export the commodity. Saxton was the hub of the Huntingdon and Broad Top Railroad (H&amp;BT) and for almost 100 years it shipped coal from Saxton to places like Bedford, Huntingdon and Everett. From there it went on to industrial centers, such as Pittsburgh or Baltimore.

The thriving railroad attracted thousands of workers and their families to the town and surrounding area. In its heyday Saxton had a bowling alley, a toy factory, a candy factory, a coal power plant, dozens of shops and businesses, and even a 7 Up bottling plant. Saxton and the surrounding area were full of industry and other businesses. These included a pig iron furnace, coke ovens, a tannery, brickyards, dairies, and others. However, the prosperity would not last, as the mines began to become exhausted of coal after World War II. This in conjunction with the recession of 1949 caused the railroad to shut down in 1955. Most of the buildings and infrastructure owned by the railroad were abandoned, and has subsequently been salvaged or left to erode away.

Saxton was chosen to be the home of the Saxton Nuclear Generating Station, the nation&#x27;s fourth nuclear power plant, which was commissioned in 1961. It was one of the first test facilities for peace-time plutonium use, as well as cooling methods that would be used to relieve meltdown situations such as the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011. The facility was decommissioned in 1972, and the radioactive core removed in 2005.

<text>Schellsburg is a borough in Bedford County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 330 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Schellsburg was so named after John Schell who settled and founded the community. John Schell&#x27;s grandfather Michael Schell first arrived in Philadelphia from the Palatinate by way of Rotterdam in 1727, after which more family members arrived in 1732 and again in 1738. In 1732 when he returned with other members of his family, Michael Schell purchased a substantial tract of land where he settled with his family in the Perkiomen Valley northwest of Philadelphia, an area in Upper Hanover Township later known as East Greenville, in what was then Philadelphia County and became Montgomery County in 1760. The adjoining community of Hillegassville was named after its founder Johann Frederick Hillegass. His granddaughter Elizabeth Barbara Hillegass married John Schell Jr., who was born in 1725 at the family homestead granted to his father John Schell Sr., the youngest son of Michael Schell who died in 1770.

At an early age, John Schell Jr. became possessed of considerable means after his patriotic service in the Revolutionary War and his father&#x27;s death in 1777. For many years he traveled extensively on business through Bedford County, western Pennsylvania and Kentucky, which was admitted as a state in 1792. He was impressed by the climate and fertile soil in Kentucky, decided to remove there and select land to establish his own community for his family and friends. In the spring of 1800, John Schell and his family, consisting of his wife, eight young children and his widowed mother, left their home in Montgomery County and traveled west. When they arrived at the Ohio River, he realized that it would be unsafe for his family to traverse the river by boat due to the Indians. He returned through Napier Township in Bedford County and decided instead to settle in what is the present location of Schellsburg.

On May 1, 1800, John Schell purchased large tracts of land of more than , which were later divided into farms and given to each of his sons with an equivalent in money and land to his daughters. His own homestead was constructed on property located outside the town of Schellsburg. John Schell generously donated land for schools, churches and town lots and granted parcels to the town and its citizens. In 1808 he laid out the town lots, developed the community and provided impetus for construction of the nearby turnpike as its first president. After he settled in Bedford County, relatives and neighbors in Montgomery County followed and settled in the area and the immediate vicinity. Schellsburg was incorporated as the second borough of Bedford County in 1838. The town was designated as the Schellsburg Historic District in 2001 and included on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of the town&#x27;s rich architectural heritage of buildings constructed of log and stone in the 19th century.

The first church in Schellsburg was Union Church. It was erected in 1806 and is the oldest church structure in Bedford County. John Schell died in 1825, his wife in 1842, and they are buried next to each other in the cemetery which encircles the church, surrounded by generations of family members who followed them. Now known as the Old Log Church, it was included on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005 as the Chestnut Ridge and Schellsburg Union Church and Cemetery. It was rededicated during the Bicentennial celebration on June 24, 2006. During the celebration, a Founder&#x27;s Stone was dedicated and placed at the grave of John Schell, which is further distinguished by a Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) marker and flag to commemorate his service in the Revolutionary War.

In 1889, citrus magnate John A. Snively was born in Schellsburg.

On November 22, 1964, Schellsburg made national news with &quot;the first... four-way merger in the history of religion in the United States&quot; when the United Church of Schellsburg held services for a congregation made up of the town&#x27;s Presbyterian, Lutheran, Methodist and United Church of Christ members.

<text>Snake Spring Township is a township in Bedford County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,770 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The Defibaugh Tavern, Bridge in Snake Spring Township, and Juniata Woolen Mill and Newry Manor are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

Snake Spring Township is located in east-central Bedford County, between the boroughs of Bedford (the county seat) and Everett. The townships borders follow mountain ridges on three sides: Tussey Mountain on the east, Evitts Mountain on the west, and a lower ridge connecting the two in the north. The Raystown Branch of the Juniata River flows west to east through the southern part of the township, cutting water gaps through Evitts Mountain (at The Narrows) and Tussey Mountain (at Mount Dallas). The Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-70 and I-76) and the older Lincoln Highway (US-30) follow the river and pass through the water gaps.

==Geology==
Snake Spring valley is an anticlinal valley, with Evitts Mountain and Tussey Mountain forming the limbs. The Silurian Tuscarora Formation, a hard sandstone, outcrops at the crests of the ridges and is stratigraphically higher and thus younger than the rest of the bedrock in the valley. The low knobs or &quot;benches&quot; on the northwest side of Tussey Mountain and the southeast side of Evitts Mountain are formed by the Ordovician Bald Eagle Formation, another sandstone, that is stratigraphically below the Tuscarora. The two mountains nearly converge at the north end of the township. The rock formations in the valley range from Ordovician shales and limestones to the Cambrian Warrior Formation, another sandstone. The limestones can form sinkholes.

==Etymology==
===Derivation of the name &quot;Amity&quot;===

In the &quot;History of Montgomery County&quot;, the author records 
the settlement of some Swedes at Douglassville a few 
years after 1699 and the connection of this settlement with 
a group of Germans at New Hanover. A road was laid out 
from New Hanover to Germantown. Along these roads, the 
word &quot;Amity&quot; was used to designate a locality. 
The name was adopted by the inhabitants of the area to 
symbolize their relations with the Indians. Although 
Sweden lost the colony in 1638, the Swedish settlers sent 
a letter to their homeland in 1693 asking for ministers and 
religious books. In this letter they stated, &quot;We live in great 
amity with the Indians, who have not done us harm for 
many years.&quot; From this incident, those Swedish settlers 
who migrated up the Schuylkill beyond the Manatawny 
called their settlement, Amity.

<text>Bally is a borough in Berks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,228 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Bally was originally called Goshenhoppen, possibly deriving from an Indian word meaning meeting &quot;place&quot;. Others claim the name derives from German settlers calling the area their haven or Hafen in German, eventually becoming Goshenhoppen. Mennonites and Catholics settled in the borough in the early 18th century.

Clergyman Ulrich Beidler erected the first house of worship, the Mennonite Church in 1731. Father Theodore Schneider, a Jesuit priest, came to the area in 1741 and established what would be just the third Catholic mission church in the 13 original colonies. On land received from the Mennonite community, Father Schneider built St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel in 1743. St. Paul&#x27;s is now known as the Most Blessed Sacrament Church, and it is the oldest existing Catholic place of worship in Pennsylvania and the fourth oldest Catholic structure in the thirteen original colonies.

In 1743, Father Schneider started a Catholic school at the mission church. The school, originally called St. Aloysius Academy, also marked the beginning of Catholic education in the 13 original colonies. After several name changes, it is currently known as St. Francis Academy, and is the oldest currently operating co-educational Catholic school in the nation.

To reflect the many churches in the town, Goshenhoppen was renamed Churchville. When the post office was established in 1883, the townsfolk changed the name to Bally in honor Father Augustine Bally, S.J., a Catholic pastor, who had died the previous year. Bally was incorporated as a borough in 1912, and Henry Eddinger, son of Frederick K. and Sophia (Miller) Eddinger, were appointed as the first Burgess.

Bally has traditionally been a home of many Pennsylvania Dutch settlers and their descendants.

In 1912, Bally resident Annie Funk, a Mennonite missionary to India, died during the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. Funk was en route to Bally to visit her ailing mother, and reportedly gave up her seat in a lifeboat to another passenger as the ship sank.

<text>Bernville (Pennsylvania Dutch: &quot;Bannwill&quot;) is a borough in Berks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 905 at the 2020 census. Bernville is bordered by Penn Township to the north, east, and south and by Jefferson Township to the west. It is believed by few that the borough would have been a county seat of a small county called Tulpehocken County. However, no official sources can be found.

==History==
Before European settlers arrived in the Tulpehocken Creek valley, the area was inhabited by the Lenape people. In 1723, thirty-three Palatine families from Schoharie, New York, moved to the confluences of the Tulpehocken and Northkill Creeks. By 1735, a saw and grist mill was located three and a half miles up the Tulpehocken river from Bernville.

In 1737, Stephanus Umbenhauer immigrated from Bern, Switzerland, and purchased from Thomas Penn. In 1819, Stephanus&#x27; grandson, Johann Thomas Umbenhauer, set aside to be divided into 62 lots. On 24 August 1819, Peter Bennethum bought the first six lots. In January 1820, the town was named Bernville after Stephanus&#x27; birthplace. The first house was built by Philip Filbert in 1820. In 1828, the Union Canal was completed, connecting the Susquehanna and Schuylkill rivers. Union Canal guard lock #36 and Lock #36 with a lift of is located at the southwest corner of Bernville, near where Northkill Creek empties into Tulpehocken Creek. An historic marker on Route 183 states: &quot;The canal, at this point, followed the north bank of the Tulpehocken. A dam, two locks, and a mule bridge made it possible for boats to cross Northkill Creek. Nearby were grist mills, a lime kiln, and a tannery.&quot; Due to the proximity of the Bernville Locks and the town&#x27;s location on the canal, Bernville was a primary and prospering canal port.

In 1851, the village of Bernville, discontented with Penn Township&#x27;s road maintenance and community services, incorporated as a borough. The borough included the original 62 lots, most of which measured . In 1884, the Union Canal closed. With no canal or railroad access, Bernville withered. In 1950, Bernville Borough annexed property from Penn Township at both ends of Main Street.

==Geography==
Bernville is located at (40.433742, -76.111039). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which , or 1.52%, is water. The boundary with Jefferson Township is formed primarily by Northkill Creek, but diverges from the creek north of its confluence with Little Northkill Creek.

==Buildings==

Main Street was laid out in 1819 and has numerous buildings dating back to the nineteenth century, including the Cyrus G. Blatt home (501-503 N. Main), the Eagle Hotel (301 N. Main) and the Joseph B. Conrad home (219 N. Main). Main Street is also the location of both churches: St. Thomas&#x27;s UCC, and Evangelical Lutheran Friedens Church. The churches are located across the street from each other.

Northkill Creek feeds into Blue Marsh Lake, and the Blue Marsh slackwater is federal property. Hence a portion of Bernville is part of the Blue Marsh system. Blue Marsh Lake is a popular recreation site, offering hiking, boating, and fishing. The lake is also important for water supply, flood control, and wildlife habitat. A levee along Northkill Creek protects Bernville from Blue Marsh flooding above elevation.

Two covered bridges, which no longer exist, crossed Northkill Creek, connecting Bernville with Jefferson Township. The Northkill Covered Bridge, 1848-~1950, crossed at 4th Street. The South Bernville Covered Bridge, 1849–1938, crossed near the South Bernville Hotel (a.k.a., Newport Hotel).

<text>Birdsboro is a borough in Berks County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located along the Schuylkill River southeast of Reading. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 5,106. Birdsboro&#x27;s economy had historically been rooted in large foundries and machine shops, none of which remain in operation today.

==History==

Birdsboro was named for ironmaker William Bird, who established a forge on Hay Creek about 1740. His son Marcus founded Hopewell Furnace in 1771, which was the largest domestic producer of iron by the time of the American Revolution. The Schuylkill Canal, running parallel to the river, was completed in 1827. The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, constructed to haul anthracite coal, was completed in 1843. Edward and George Brooke, descendants of the Birds, established the Birdsboro Iron Foundry Company (1867), which became Birdsboro Steel Company (1905). The principal employer for 120 years, the steel plant closed in 1988, following a lengthy strike.

The borough was created in 1872, from sections of Union and Robeson townships. Its population increased slowly from 2,261 in 1890, to 2,264 in 1900, to 2,930 in 1910. The population was 5,064 at the 2000 census.

Armorcast Corporation built a plant in the borough in 1944, which manufactured tanks for World War II and the Korean War. The plant closed in 1988.

Suburban housing developments such as Mansion Heights, built on the hills overlooking the valley in the 1980s and 1990s, increased the borough&#x27;s population markedly. Still, the local Episcopal church closed in 2002, and the Roman Catholic parish built a new church and school outside the borough, in Douglassville, in 2005.

In 1987, torrential rains over a period of several days caused Hay Creek to flood parts of Pennsylvania Route 82, which ran through the borough at the time, and damaged the five bridges between Rock Hollow Road and Douglas Street. The bridge upstream from Douglas Street was repaired. However, after many years of discussion between local and state officials, the decision was finally made in 2004 that the remaining upstream bridges should not be rebuilt. For years, the area had been used as an informal walking trail. The former road connecting Birdsboro to Scarlet&#x27;s Mill is now used formally as a nature trail. In December 2008, the PA 82 designation was removed from this stretch of road. This area is now part of Hopewell Big Woods, which allows public access for hiking, fishing, hunting and other outdoor activities.

St. Michael&#x27;s Protestant Episcopal Church, Parish House and Rectory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

<text>Exeter Township is a township in Berks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 25,500 as of the 2020 census, making it the third-most populous municipality in Berks County after the city of Reading and Spring Township. Daniel Boone Homestead is within its borders. This formerly rural township is now made up of mostly sprawl-oriented developments along U.S. Route 422 (Perkiomen Avenue) and Route 562 (St. Lawrence Avenue/Boyertown Pike).

== History ==
The name Exeter derives from the town of Exeter in Devon, England. Numerous other places have also been given the name Exeter.

The John Bishop House, Boonecroft, Exeter Friends Meeting House, Levan Farm, Mordecai Lincoln House, Mill Tract Farm, and Snyder Mill are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Origin ==

Exeter Township is believed to have been first settled in 1701. Swedes, relocating from the Philadelphia and Delaware River areas, settled in what is now Amity Township. In 1712, Isaac DeTurk moved from Esopus, New York to Oley and began a settlement there. It was a mix of French Huguenots, Germans, Quakers and Swiss. In 1740, they petitioned Philadelphia County for Oley to become its own Township. Exeter Township was founded December 7, 1741. 
Previously considered part of Oley Township, the area&#x27;s residents petitioned Philadelphia County to become a separate Township six months after the establishment of Oley. The petitioners were: James Boone, Benjamin Boone, John Boone, Squire Boone, John Hughes, William Hughes, Francis Yarnell, Peter Yarnell, Michael Warren, Peter Huyett, Peter Higo, David Gerrad, Ezekiel Mathias, Roger Rogers, Joseph Brown, Jacob Vetter, and Ellis Hughes. These petitioners represent our Quaker background, and mostly resided in the area around the Quaker Meetinghouse and the Monocacy and Limekiln creeks. The actual name of the Township, &quot;Exeter&quot;, is generally credited to the George Boone family. That family was from a town called Bradninch, England, just outside the town of Exeter. Many similarities still exist between the two cities, among them being the geography, soil type, and proximity to a town called St. Lawrence.

== Early residents and communities ==
The first community created in Exeter was called Snydersville. It was populated mostly by relatives of Hans Schneider from the Limekiln area. It contained stores, schools, mills, and even a hotel. Some of the other communities that developed early were: Baumstown, Black Bear, Jacksonwald, St. Lawrence, Stonersville, Stonetown, Lorane, and Neversink Station. George Boone and family were one of the most influential families in Exeter. At one time they owned over of land in the Township and were among the petitioners to form the Township. 
Of course there&#x27;s Daniel Boone as well, who we know grew up in Exeter and went on to become famous in his journeys from Kentucky to Missouri. 
Another important name is Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s great-great grandfather, Mordecai had a homestead that is still standing along Heister&#x27;s creek.

==Growth==
Through the 19th and 20th centuries, Exeter began to grow due to the need for connections, between the city of Reading, Oley, Boyertown, Birdsboro, and King of Prussia. Trolley lines pushed through the Township, in the Farming Ridge area on its way to Boyertown and in the Reiffton area headed towards Birdsboro. Suburban sprawl got going post WWII to boost Exeter&#x27;s population and the Route 422 Expy to King of Prussia was completed in the 1980s. 
All of these things lead us up to what Exeter Township is today, a thriving community of over 25,000 people.

==Geography==

However, Martin Kaerscher Jr.&#x27;s father Johann Martin Kaerscher Sr. (1718-1787) emigrated in 1738 from Langenselbold in Hessia which is far from the northern seaport of Hamburg, so it is likely that &quot;Hamburg&quot; is a corruption of Bad Homburg due to the Blue Mountains&#x27; very similar appearance to the Taunus mountain range. 

On July 1, 1798 Hamburg became the second town with postal designation in Berks County, preceded only by Reading.

The Centre Turnpike was created in 1812, running between the Reading and Pottsville. Hamburg began to grow rapidly due to the close proximity of a major roadway. Eight years later, the Schuylkill Canal was completed, followed quickly by railroad lines. Both of these advances in infrastructure had stops in Hamburg and helped spur population growth.

In 1837, Hamburg was officially organized as a borough.

The Hamburg Historic District, Hamburg Armory, and Hamburg Public Library are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
