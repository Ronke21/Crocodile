<doc id="136012" wikidata="Q970829" url="?curid=136012" title="La Porte, Texas">
<text>La Porte ( ) is a city in Harris County, Texas, United States, within the Bay Area of the Houston–Sugar Land–Baytown metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 35,124. La Porte is the fourth-largest incorporated city in Harris County.

When La Porte celebrated its centennial in 1992, it was the home of Barbours Cut Terminal, operated by the Port of Houston Authority since 1977. Fifteen years later, the Port of Houston&#x27;s newest addition, Bayport Terminal, was established just south of La Porte. The area around La Porte has served an increasingly important role in international trade since the 1970s.

The area around modern La Porte gained fame early in Texas history as the location of the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836, which ended the Texas Revolution, establishing the independence of the Republic of Texas from Mexico. The San Jacinto Monument, in the unincorporated area of La Porte, commemorates the battle. During the early 20th century, particularly the 1920s and 1930s, La Porte&#x27;s Sylvan Beach became a nationally known tourist destination attracting some of the nation&#x27;s most well-known entertainers. As a result of changing economics in the Houston area and beach erosion, the tourist business declined while industrial development in the area grew. During World War II and afterward, La Porte&#x27;s economy rapidly shifted toward petroleum/petrochemicals and shipping, which developed as the dominant industries in the Pasadena-Baytown area.

==History==

The community of La Porte was founded in 1892 as a speculative real estate venture by an investment group. A public space known as Sylvan Grove was reserved by the waterfront. The area around Sylvan Grove soon was developed with amenities including bathhouses, boating piers, and a Victorian hotel with a dance pavilion. La Porte quickly became the most popular tourist destination in the Houston area. Sylvan Grove Park was acquired in 1896 by a company known as Adoue and Lobit and renamed Sylvan Beach. Cottage retreats were built around the waterfront.

In 1900, the devastating Galveston Hurricane hit the shoreline, seriously damaging the community&#x27;s attractions. As the Texas Oil Boom took hold beginning in 1901, and neighboring Houston became home to many wealthy businessmen, La Porte quickly rebuilt and re-established itself as a tourist center. It was, however, damaged again by a major fire and another hurricane in 1915. The community rebuilt again.

During the 1920s and 1930s Sylvan Beach Amusement Park became a nationally recognized destination, featuring beauty contests and regular performances by famous bands, in addition to a growing gallery of amenities. Some of the most well-known performers of the era, including Guy Lombardo, the Dorsey Brothers, Phil Harris, and Benny Goodman, appeared at the park. In the 1930s the park was completely revamped, with additions of a large boardwalk, amusement rides, and many other attractions. The residential community remained small, supported exclusively by Sylvan Beach tourism and the nearby Bay Ridge community, an area of beachfront summer homes in neighboring Morgan&#x27;s Point built by wealthy Houstonians.

The beachfront began to physically shrink beginning around 1928 because of erosion from the wakes of shipping traffic, and land subsidence resulting from the extraction of groundwater in the area due to development. Gas rationing in World War II slowed tourism. A hurricane in 1943 destroyed most of the tourist attractions. Most of the damaged structures at Sylvan Beach were never rebuilt after this time, as the area was changing, and La Porte&#x27;s tourist industry rapidly declined. By the later 20th century, erosion had completely eliminated the beach.

As shipyards and industrial plants in World War II were developed in nearby communities such as Pasadena, Baytown, and Deer Park, the community&#x27;s residents became more dependent on these businesses. The opening of the La Porte-Baytown tunnel in 1954 further spurred development. The later establishment of the Johnson Space Center in the nearby Clear Lake Area, the Barbours Cut shipping terminal in neighboring Morgan&#x27;s Point, and the Bayport Industrial District within La Porte&#x27;s jurisdiction have gradually made the community successful as part of the Houston area&#x27;s industrial heartland.

Much of the history of La Porte&#x27;s glory years as a tourist haven has been preserved by the La Porte Bay Area Heritage Society. Plans have been discussed for many years to restore La Porte&#x27;s status as a tourist destination. A project to restore the beachfront at Sylvan Beach Park began in 2009 and finished in 2013, with sand brought in from other areas and dredging operations. Other plans, including building a large hotel on the shoreline, have been discussed as well.

<text>Morgan&#x27;s Point is located 30 miles southeast of Houston in southeastern Harris County, Texas, United States, located on the shores of Galveston Bay at the inlet to the Houston Ship Channel, near La Porte and Baytown. As of the 2020 census, it has 273 residents, and is located within the La Porte Independent School District.

Morgan&#x27;s Point National Historic District includes the &quot;Carriage House&quot; otherwise known as City Hall, and the Governor Ross S. Sterling mansion, directly across the street; as well as several other notable properties. It earned fame in Texas&#x27;s early history for being the home of the legendary Emily West (Morgan), known as &quot;The Yellow Rose of Texas&quot;. It later became a Houston-area resort community for the wealthy in the early 20th century.

==History==

The area was first settled in 1822 by Nicholas Rightor, a surveyor commissioned by Stephen F. Austin to explore and survey the areas between the Brazos and Lavaca rivers. He soon sold the property to Johnson Calhoun Hunter, and it subsequently was bought by Joseph C. Clopper, who used the property to grow orange and lemon trees. The property was finally sold to James Morgan in 1834, who established the short-lived colony of New Washington. Morgan had helped supply the Texian army during the Texas Revolution and was given the rank of colonel. The settlement was destroyed by the Mexican army during the Texas Revolution. A legend surfaced much later surrounding a mulatto woman named Emily West. She became an indentured servant (but not a slave) of Morgan and, according to legend, used her beauty to occupy Mexican General Santa Anna, thereby facilitating his capture by the Texan army, thus ending the revolutionary war. Historians differ on the degree of truth of this legend.

The area began to redevelop as the Houston Ship Channel was dredged near the area in the later 19th century. The community grew around traffic crossing the ship channel to and from Goose Creek (now Baytown). Ferry service would eventually become established. The Morgan Point Ferry operated until the mid 20th century.

Following the start of the Texas oil boom in 1901 Galveston Bay became an attractive summer destination for the wealthy from Houston and nearby areas. Plots along Bayridge Road were sold for the construction of summer homes, including the famed Sterling Mansion, a former governor&#x27;s residence that is now a landmark (not to be confused with the mansion in Houston). During the 1920s and 1930s the shoreline between Morgan&#x27;s Point and Sylvan Beach came to be known as the Texas &quot;Gold Coast&quot;, a playground for the rich.

As the surrounding communities of La Porte and Baytown grew, interest in the area as a summer haven diminished. Morgan&#x27;s Point was finally incorporated in 1949, and a small community remained. Some of the original 19th century buildings have remained, as well as early 20th century homes.

The area received a major economic boost in 1977 with the opening of the Barbours Cut shipping terminal, operated by the Port of Houston Authority. However, in building Barbours Cut, the Port of Houston used its power of eminent domain to evict residents from nearly one third of the community&#x27;s homes. Still the terminal almost instantly became the Houston area&#x27;s most important shipping point and became the centerpiece of the economy activity at Morgan&#x27;s Point.

<text>Pasadena () is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, located in Harris County. It is part of the metropolitan area. As of the 2020 U.S. census, the city&#x27;s population was 151,950, making it the 23rd most populous city in Texas and the second most populous in Harris County, after Houston. The area was founded in 1893 by John H. Burnett of Galveston, who named the area after Pasadena, California, because of the perceived lush vegetation.

==History==
===Early history===
Prior to European settlement the area around Galveston Bay was settled by the Karankawa and Atakapan tribes, particularly the Akokisa, who lived throughout the Gulf coast region. Spanish explorers such as the Rivas-Iriarte expedition and José Antonio de Evia charted the bay and gave it its name. The pirate Jean Lafitte established a short-lived kingdom based in Galveston in the early 19th century with bases and hide-outs around the bay and around Clear Lake. Lafitte was forced to leave in 1821 by the U.S. Navy.

Following its declaration of independence from Spain the new nation of Mexico moved to colonize its northern territory of Texas by offering land grants to settlers both from within Mexico and from the nearby United States. The colony established by Stephen F. Austin and the Galveston Bay and Texas Land Company of New York rapidly began a wave of settlement around the bay. Following a coup in the Mexican government by General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, Texas revolted against Mexican rule in 1835. After several battles and skirmishes the final battle of the Texas Revolution took place near modern Pasadena on April 21, 1836. While the main battlefield was located in the neighboring present-day city of La Porte, Santa Anna was captured in present-day Pasadena at Vince&#x27;s Bayou. Because this was the last conflict that led to the Mexican surrender, Pasadena and neighboring Deer Park have adopted the nickname &quot;Birthplace of Texas&quot;.

===Ranching and settlement===
Sam Allen started a ranch in 1843 with .
This became the Allen Ranch which occupied what is now western Pasadena all the way to Harrisburg, Texas. By 1888, the ranch contained in Harris County, in Brazoria County, Texas with grazing lands in Galveston and Fort Bend Counties.

The Galveston, Houston &amp; Henderson Railroad ran through the Allen ranch. There was a problem of cattle being regularly killed on the tracks and in 1875, Allen built a fence along the east side of the railway right of way to keep the cattle off the tracks. The fence ran from Harrisburg to League City and had four rails and a top rail wide enough to walk on. A gate was placed in the fence at the Harrisburg-Lynchburg Road with a large sign above instructing that it should be closed at all times. The area east of this railroad fence running from Buffalo Bayou to the tracks on Sims Bayou ran all the way to Galveston Bay. It contained of grazing land for cattle.

&quot;Proposed&quot; towns in or near present-day Pasadena were set up but short lived and either abandoned or never even got off the ground.
In 1892 Colonel John H. Burnett of Galveston established an unnamed townsite on the Vince Survey just east of the Allen Ranch. Burnett was involved in both construction and promotion of railroads and knew their impact on the value of property. The land was sold in lots. He had also established the nearby towns of Deepwater and Genoa, later to be incorporated into Pasadena and Houston.

===20th century===
The 1900 hurricane that destroyed Galveston heavily damaged Pasadena, as well. The city received a population boost from some Galveston refugees who relocated to the mainland following the catastrophe. Donations by the newly created Red Cross, including millions of strawberry plants to Gulf Coast farmers, helped revive the community. This and the subsequent establishment of a major strawberry farm in the area by Texaco founder Joseph S. Cullinan made Pasadena a major fruit producer for many years afterward. As the community recovered major tracts of the Allen Ranch were liquidated opening up new development. Rice farmers from Japan settled in the community further diversifying its agriculture. Champion Coated Paper Company of Ohio opened a paper mill in 1937. Other businesses began to develop.

In 1901 the Texas Oil Boom began with the gusher at Spindletop. The discovery of the oil field at Goose Creek led to increasing petroleum exploration around Galveston Bay. By 1917–1920 refinery operations had appeared in Pasadena and continued to expand thereafter for example the &quot;Pasadena Refining System&quot;... The world wars gradually brought further industrial development, with Pasadena&#x27;s growth rate surpassing even neighboring Houston.

Pasadena voted to incorporate in 1923, but residents decided to cancel the incorporation one year later. Pasadena incorporated in 1928. Because of the 1928 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Pasadena&#x27;s territory into its city limits, while Houston annexed surrounding areas that were unincorporated.

By the mid-20th century Pasadena&#x27;s economy had become strongly tied to petroleum and other heavy industry. NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center (JSC) was established near Pasadena in 1963 with the residential community of Clear Lake City, partially under Pasadena&#x27;s jurisdiction, established nearby. These developments helped to diversify the town&#x27;s economy significantly. Eventually, the city gained the unofficial moniker &quot;Stinkadena&quot; by locals due to the pollution from its large industrial base.

Former Pasadena City Council member and State Representative Ray Barnhart described the city at the time as &quot;a lovely community but politically corrupt.&quot; Barnhart recalled that a half dozen Pasadena officials were indicted in the late 1950s and early 1960s for public corruption.

In 1965, &quot;Houston Post&quot; reporter Gene Goltz Received the Pulitzer Prize for his exposure of government corruption in Pasadena, Texas, which resulted in widespread reforms.

<text>Piney Point Village is a city in Harris County, Texas, United States. The population was 3,128 at the 2020 census. Piney Point Village is the wealthiest place in Texas, as ranked by per capita income. It is part of a collection of upscale residential communities in west Houston known as the Memorial Villages.

==History==
In 1885 Piney Point Village began as a station on the Texas Western Railroad. German farmers settled in the area. According to 1936 state highway maps, the community was near a sawmill.

In the mid 1950s, an effort to form a Spring Branch municipality failed. Piney Point Village incorporated in 1955 with an alderman form of government. Because of the 1955 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Piney Point Village&#x27;s territory into its city limits, while Houston annexed surrounding areas that were unincorporated. In 1960 the city had 1,790 residents. By 1966 the city had one public school and four churches. In 1990 the city had 3,380 residents.

For a decade ending in 1993 the Consulate-General of Japan in Houston refused to pay &quot;user fees&quot; billed to the consulate by the City of Piney Point Village (the consul-general residence is in Piney Point Village). The Japanese argued that this was a tax and that diplomatic facilities should not be taxed. In 1993 Piney Point Village announced that the consulate owed the city around $14,000 United States dollars. The Japanese argued that international agreements exempted consulate facilities from taxes, while Piney Point Village said the annual fees were for user services. James Baker, a Piney Point Village alderman, threatened to suspend garbage pickup services and expose the Japanese consulate to ridicule. In September of that year a U.S. State Department letter stated that consulates should pay legitimate user fees, and that consulates do not have to pay for fire and police services. The consulate paid almost $12,000, including $4,500 in interest, to the city. According to Vice-Consul Takaki Takinami originally the city charged $14,915.52 before changing the invoice and deducting police and fire costs. Shojiro Imanishi, who was the outgoing consul-general, agreed to pay $4,500 annually. In 1993 the Consulate-General of Indonesia in Houston and the Consulate-General of Australia in Houston had consul-general residences in Piney Point Village; they paid the fees voluntarily and without controversy.

The residents believed that the city government&#x27;s manner of purchasing and the lack of notification of area residents was not ethical. The city government stated that it decided to buy the mansion to avoid high rental costs. The city later backed out of the deal. Effective on July 26, 2007 city hall moved to Suite 300 in the 7676 Woodway office complex at 7676 Woodway Drive in Houston.

==History==

C.S. Woods of the Western Land Company founded the settlement of Dumont in 1907. A post office appeared in 1910. In 1913 Dumont was incorporated as the city of South Houston. Because of the 1913 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate South Houston&#x27;s territory into its city limits, while Houston annexed surrounding areas that were unincorporated. South Houston&#x27;s initial industrial activity consisted of shipping produce along the Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad. The hurricane of 1915 destroyed many of the local industries. The establishment of the Houston Ship Channel resulted in the establishment of manufacturing industries inland, including in South Houston. Between the 1940s and the early 1960s South Houston found rapid population growth. The city had 7,523 inhabitants in 1960. In 1980, South Houston had 11,782 inhabitants and 303 businesses. In 1990, 14,207 inhabitants lived in South Houston.

Elephants belonging to former South Houston mayor George Christy, a circus owner, assisted the construction of the Spencer Highway.

From the 1980 census to the 1990 census, Hispanics began to move into South Houston by an amount between 1,000 and 3,500 per square mile. Most Hispanics in South Houston were of Mexican descent.

==Geography==
South Houston is located at (29.660980, –95.229787).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 7.8 km2, all land.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 16,153 people, 5,221 households, and 4,107 families residing in the city.

As of the census of 2010, there were 16,983 people from 4,617 households residing in the city.

==History==

Southside Place opened on Easter Day in 1925. Edlo L. Crain, the developer, placed a pool and a park in a subdivision to attract residents to the townsite. The first section to open was south of the park. It was in proximity to Bellaire Boulevard and the streetcar line, which was nicknamed the &quot;Toonerville Trolley&quot;. In 1926, development of the second section of Southside Place, which spanned from Harper Street to University Boulevard, began. The Great Depression slowed development. The site of Southside Place previously housed the Harris County Poor Farm. The Haden and Austin company had purchased the poor farm and, after a period, sold it to the E. L. Crain and Company.

Southside Place incorporated in June 1931, with 600 residents. The city council first met on June 15 of that year. On August 3, 1934 the city council passed a resolution that declared Southside Place an incorporated city. Because of the incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Southside Place&#x27;s territory into its city limits, while Houston annexed surrounding areas that were unincorporated. A post office opened in 1940. Before World War II, the population stabilized at approximately 1,400. In the 1960s, the city reached a high of 1,500 residents.

<text>Spring is a census-designated place (CDP) within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of Houston in Harris County, Texas, United States, part of the metropolitan area. The population was 62,559 at the 2020 census. While the name &quot;Spring&quot; is popularly applied to a large area of northern Harris County and a smaller area of southern Montgomery County, the original town of Spring, now known as Old Town Spring, is at the intersection of Spring-Cypress and Hardy roads and encompasses perhaps .

==History==
The large geographic area now known as Spring was originally inhabited by the Orcoquiza Native Americans. In 1836, the Texas General Council of the Provisional Government placed what is now the town of Spring in the Harrisburg municipality. In 1838, William Pierpont placed a trading post on Spring Creek. In 1840, the town of Spring had 153 residents. By the mid-1840s, many German immigrants, including Gus Bayer and Carl Wunsche, moved to the area and began farming. People from Louisiana and other parts of the post-Civil War Southern U.S. settled in Spring. The main cash crops in Spring were sugar cane and cotton; residents also grew vegetables.

The International and Great Northern Railroad, built through Spring, opened in 1871 and caused Spring to expand. In 1873, Spring received a post office. By 1884, Spring had 150 residents, two steam saw and grist mills, two cotton gins, three churches, and several schools. In 1901–1903, the International-Great Northern Railroad opened, connecting Spring to Fort Worth. Spring, now with a roundhouse, became a switchyard with 200 rail workers and 14 track yards. The population increased to 1,200 by 1910. After the roundhouse relocated to Houston in 1923, Spring&#x27;s population declined; by 1931, it was 300. The Spring State Bank opened in 1912. It was robbed several times in the 1930s; there was a false rumor that one of the robberies was committed by Bonnie and Clyde. The bank consolidated with Tomball Bank in 1935.

By 1947, Spring had 700 residents. In the 1970s, Houston&#x27;s suburbs began to expand northward, and more subdivisions and residential areas opened in the Spring area. Some older houses in the town of Spring were restored and housed shops. The Old Town Spring Association opened in 1980 to promote the Old Town Spring shopping area, which consists of the restored houses. In 1984, the Spring area had 15,000 residents. By 1989, Old Town Spring became a tourist area. In 1990, the Spring area had 33,111 residents.

From 1969 to 1992, the Goodyear airship &quot;America&quot; was based in Spring from its large hangar visible just off Interstate 45. Takeoffs and landings were a major attraction and motorists continually pulled off to the interstate&#x27;s shoulders to watch. In 1992 the &quot;America&quot; was moved to Akron, Ohio, and the massive hangar was eventually torn down. As of 2020, the hangar&#x27;s concrete foundation is still visible at the intersection of Holzwarth Road and Meadow Edge Lane west of Lowe&#x27;s Home Improvement Center.

The 1992 Log Cabin Republicans convention was held in Spring.

=====History of public schools=====
Originally Spring was served by the Spring Common School District. In 1935 that district and the Harrell Common School District merged, forming the Spring Independent School District. The Southwell School, the segregated African-American school, served Spring from the early 1900s until 1945. In 1932 the Wunsche family donated land to the Spring school district, and the Carl Wunsche School, serving middle and high school, opened. In 1947 an addition opened and elementary school students began to be served by Wunsche. Salyers, opened in 1959 as Spring Elementary School, was Spring ISD&#x27;s first dedicated elementary school. After Salyers opened, elementary school classes were removed from Wunsche School. Spring High School opened in 1969, taking high school students from Wunsche. As a result, Wunsche became SISD&#x27;s first dedicated middle school.

Winship Elementary School&#x27;s classes began in 1972; the Winship campus opened on December 15 of that year. Jenkins opened on February 6, 1977. Hirsch opened in 1978. Anderson opened in 1979.

=====Northwoods Catholic School=====
Northwoods Catholic School, a private Catholic school in the Spring area, was off the intersection of Farm to Market Road 2920 and Gosling Road, in a campus. It used a curriculum from the Legionaries of Christ. Established , it was not affiliated with the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston. It initially had 13 students, and was in a facility in the Ponderosa Forest neighborhood, an apartment clubhouse temporarily used as a school.

In 2003 it had 200 students. By that year its permanent facility opened; it had a price tag of $6 million. In 2004 it had 250 students. In 2005 academic dean Susan Horne became the principal, and the previous principal, Joe Noonan, became Northwood&#x27;s executive director. In 2010 it had about 230 students, with about 40% of them originating from The Woodlands. The building&#x27;s first floor had of space. Its second floor, with offices, computer and science labs, and a library, was blessed on August 13, 2010, and opened on August 18. It was built in three months.

In the 2015–16 school year, the school&#x27;s final year of operation, it had 268 students; it was projected to have 160 for the following year. The school announced on May 4, 2016, that it was closing because of a shrinking budget and declining enrollment. It closed on June 30, 2016. An area developer who was buying land from the school got into a legal dispute with the landowner and a Catholic priest.

===Community colleges===
Lone Star College System (formerly the North Harris Montgomery Community College District) serves Spring ISD, Klein ISD, and Conroe ISD, and therefore the entire Spring area. Areas in Cy-Fair ISD (and therefore Lakes on Eldridge) are in Lone Star College. Spring ISD residents and two other K–12 school districts voted to create North Harris County College. The community college district began operations in 1973.

===Public libraries===
Harris County Public Library (HCPL) operates several library branches.

HCPL operates the Baldwin Boettcher Branch Library at Mercer Park at 22248 Aldine Westfield Road, south of the Spring CDP. The branch opened in 1986. It was constructed on donated land. It was named after Baldwin Boettcher, a German settler. His descendants deeded the homestead to Harris County. The plans stated that the Boettcher staff would assist the Mercer Park staff in finding any botanical reference books that they or the public need.

The Barbara Bush Branch Library at Cypress Creek is at 6817 Cypresswood Drive in an area with a Spring address west of the Spring CDP. The branch opened in 1976 and was upgraded and expanded in 2002. Construction of the current library began in the summer of 2000. The current branch was anticipated to house over 120,000 books and materials, making it twice as large as the previous branch. Jesse Sendejas of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said there was &quot;a need to provide a more spacious and accommodating facility to Spring and its surrounding areas. That was apparent when county voters approved a $15 million bond for library improvements in November 1997.&quot;

Pundt Park is a park at 4129 Spring Creek Drive that was being developed as of 2008. The park was to have a canoe launch, a pavilion facility with a meeting room and toilets, a playground facility, picnic areas, and a trail system connecting Bayer Park to the Spring Creek Greenway. Precinct 4 also operates the Mercer Arboretum and Botanic Gardens, south of and adjacent to the Spring CDP at 22306 Aldine Westfield Road.

The Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion in The Woodlands is in proximity to Spring.

===Old Town Spring===
Old Town Spring is an old town with over 150 shops, restaurants, and art galleries in Spring, a community in unincorporated Harris County, Texas.

Old Town Spring is north of Houston and outside Beltway 8. Many of the original buildings, some over 100 years old, now house places to buy antiques, collectibles, clothing, and gifts.

After the Depression, Prohibition, and a relocation of the railroad headquarters, the town slowly declined in population until Houston&#x27;s oil boom in the 1970s and 1980s brought merchants back to the area.

In 2015, a parish of the Greater Church of Lucifer opened in the town, which resulted in over 100 protesters.

<text>Spring Valley Village is a city in Harris County, Texas, United States, and an enclave of Houston. The population was 4,229 at the 2020 U.S. census.

==History==
In 1936 state highway maps indicated a cemetery and a church. Initially the settlement consisted of one and one-half square miles.

In the mid-1950s, efforts to form a Spring Branch municipality (proposed to be called the city of Spring Branch in roughly the area known today as the Memorial Villages) failed. The city incorporated in 1955 as Spring Valley. There had been two elections for incorporation. The first result was against incorporation, and state law mandated that the next election for incorporation of the same boundary would have to be held at least one year later. Some advocates of incorporation convinced Robert R. Casey, then a Harris county judge, to modify the boundary of the proposed area by removing the Campbell Place area and therefore many voters who opposed incorporating. The following election, held on April 9, 1955, was in favor of incorporation, 183 for and 165 against. Because of the 1955 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Spring Valley&#x27;s territory into its city limits, while Houston annexed surrounding areas that were unincorporated. In 1960 the city had 3,004 residents and two businesses. The city had 3,800 residents in 1976 and 3,392 residents in 1990.

<text>Webster is a city in the U.S. state of Texas located in Harris County, within the Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan area. Its population was 12,499 at the 2020 U.S. census.

==History==

The community was founded in 1879 by James W. Webster under the name &quot;Gardentown&quot;. It was established initially as a colony for settlers from England. It began as a stopover for travelers between Houston/Harrisburg, Galveston, Kemah, and Seabrook. Eventually, railroads, such as the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway, were built through the area. Farmers in the area raised pears and other produce.

In 1903, the Houston Chamber of Commerce invited Seito Saibara, a former Japanese member of parliament and a Christian theologian, to come to Texas to teach rice farming. Rice at that time was emerging as an important cash crop. Saibara settled in Webster and established a small farming community of Japanese Christians. Saibara and his son Kiyoaki established the foundations of what became the rice industry of the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Dairies and livestock ranches developed in the town, as well, in the early 1900s. Petroleum was discovered at the Webster (Friendswood) Oil Field in 1937, but the population remained small. The community was incorporated in 1958.

In 1961, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced that it was building the Manned Spacecraft Center (now known as the Johnson Space Center) nearby along the shores of Clear Lake. Growth and development quickly swept over the Clear Lake area, and Webster&#x27;s population blossomed. Webster today has become a thriving bedroom community closely tied to the Clear Lake area and its high-tech industry.

<text>West University Place, often called West University or West U for short, is a city located in the U.S. state of Texas within the metropolitan area and southwestern Harris County. At the 2020 U.S. census, the population of the city was 14,955. It is nicknamed &quot;The Neighborhood City&quot; and is mainly a bedroom community for upper-class families.

West University Place is surrounded by the cities of Bellaire, Houston, and Southside Place. , West University Place has the state&#x27;s fifth highest concentration of households with incomes $150,000 or greater.

==History==
The city was developed in 1917 by Ben Hooper, a former Tennessee governor. The name &quot;West University Place&quot; originated from its proximity to Rice Institute, now known as Rice University. The first lots in the community were sold in 1917. Portions of West University were previously within the Harris County Poor farm, which extended from an area between Bellaire Boulevard and Bissonnet Street, eastward to an area near the &quot;poor farm ditch.&quot;

In the 1920s, Lillian &quot;Lilly&quot; Nicholson, a Rice University English major, lived with a friend whose father was a city planner. The city planner asked Nicholson and her friend to name the streets of West University Place. Nicholson took names from her English literature book and gave them to the streets in West University Place. As a result, many West University streets are named after authors. Cydney Mackey, a family friend of Nicholson, said in a &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; article, &quot;Aunt Lilly had always said she wanted to be an architect, unknown for women in that era, and this was her way of making a small but lasting mark on our city&#x27;s landscape.&quot; One street, Weslayan Road, is a misspelling of &quot;Wesleyan.&quot;

The City of West University Place was declared incorporated by the County Judge of Harris County on January 2, 1924. The city incorporated because Houston was reluctant to extend power lines that far from the city center. West University Place, unlike Houston Heights, did not consolidate into the City of Houston. Because of the 1923 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate West University Place&#x27;s territory into its city limits, while Houston annexed surrounding areas that were unincorporated. In 1939, the municipality refused to consolidate, later adopting a formal city charter the following year. The city had around 15,000 residents in the 1960s and the 1970s. The city had 12,714 people in 1990.

Prior to 1992 West University Place liberalized its development rules. This allowed developers to build new houses within the city. Don Stowers of the &quot;Houston Post&quot; said that West University Place changed from an &quot;aging middle-class neighborhood&quot; consisting of mid-20th century bungalows and cottages to an increasingly wealthy community of &quot;dare we say, young urban professionals in their austere red-brick Georgians.&quot; As new houses appeared, property values increased and the city began to get more tax revenue. Eventually, West University Place ran out of available lots, and its construction peaked. Area home buyers began to consider nearby Bellaire because it had more inexpensive and larger lots, and amenities described by Stowers as &quot;comparable&quot; to West University Place&#x27;s amenities.On October 22, 2018 24/7 Wall Street, which collaborates with &quot;USA Today&quot;, ranked West University Place the &quot;best city to live in&quot;.

==Geography==

West University Place is located at (29.715929, −95.432992). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The city of Houston surrounds much of West University Place. The boundaries are roughly Bellaire Boulevard/Holcombe Boulevard, Kirby Drive, Bissonnet Road, and Community Drive. West University Place is from Downtown Houston.

The city&#x27;s boundaries are Kirby Drive to the east, Union Pacific St. Louis Southwestern Railway railroad track to the west, Bellaire Boulevard/West Holcombe Boulevard to the south, and Bissonnet and Law Streets to the north. Viewed on a map, the city shape resembles a little house, with a &quot;chimney&quot; to the west side, and since it surrounds the city of Southside Place, a &quot;door&quot; is formed on the map surrounding Southside Place. (See map)

The Poor Farm Ditch is a ditch that drains into the Brays Bayou that formerly belonged to the Harris County poor farm. In 1928, the ditch was dredged after significant flooding had occurred in the area. On occasions, the ditch still flooded. The commissioners of the City of West University adjourned their meeting so they could dam streets in December 1935. The Harris County Flood Control District, in 1954, widened and deepened the ditch and added a concrete bottom and siding. During that year the district installed a chain link fence. To make the ditch more attractive, the Sunset Terrace Garden Club planted oleanders around the ditch; the oleanders obscure the view of the ditch from Edloe Street to the east. The West University Garden Club maintained the flowers. A 2001 Edloe Greenbelt proposal called for the removal of the flowers.

===Cityscape===
In 2018, Mimi Swartz of &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; described it as &quot;an orderly quarter where older brick bungalows and modest two-story colonials reside in peace alongside grand—but not too grand—new construction.&quot; The typical lot size in West University Place is .

The original housing stock of West University Place consisted of mid-20th century bungalows and cottages. Prior to 1992, the City of West University Place liberalized its development rules, allowing for new houses to be built in the city. As lot sizes were typically approximately by , the houses constructed were Georgian houses described by Don Stowers of the &quot;Houston Post&quot; as &quot;lot hugging.&quot; Because nearby Bellaire had larger, more inexpensive lots, many area home seekers began to consider Bellaire. In a 15-year period ending in 2002, around half of the existing houses in West University Place were torn down and replaced with newer houses.

There are a total of 26 subdivisions within West University: West University Place (First and Second), Belle Court, Bissonnet Place, Cambridge Place, College Court (part), College View (1st through 4th), Colonial Terrace, Cunningham Terrace, Evanston, Fairview, Kent Place, Krenzler Court, Matthews Place, Monticello, Pemberton, Pershing Place, Preston Place, Quenby Court, Rice Court, Sunset Terrace (part), Tangley Place, and Virginia Court. Rice Court is located north of University Boulevard and east of Buffalo Speedway. Pemberton is an area south of University Drive and east of Wakeforest Street. People living in the area were fond of restoration of older houses, and it includes some of West U&#x27;s more expensive homes. Colonial Terrace is west of Weslayan Street and is near the railroad tracks. Originally, it was the least developed part of West University Place. By 2000, this area was as built up and popular as other areas within West University Place.

West University Baptist Church was established in 1928 by Nannie David; at the time the charter indicated 18 members. Beginning circa 2007 there was an attempt to swap land with the city government, but some residents protested as they feared eminent domain. In 2015 the attempt ended in failure after political rancor.

St. Andrews Presbyterian Church is in the city limits. In 2004 there were fewer than 600 members, and Sarah Williams of the &quot;West U Examiner&quot; described it as being &quot;midsize&quot;.

St. George Orthodox Church moved to West University Place in September 1954. In 2012 it received mosaics made by a British artist, Aidan Hart.

The area Catholic church, St. Vincent de Paul, is in the Houston city limits. It was established in 1939 with the parish church being built from the following year. The Catholic church is a part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston.

==Economy==
AT&amp;T operates a telephone exchange center at 4068 Bellaire Boulevard.

==Government and infrastructure==
===Local government===

The city of West University Place operates under the Council-Manager form of government. The council contains the mayor and four city council members. The city council, elected on a non-partisan basis, is elected during the first Saturday in the May of every odd-numbered year. Each member serves a term of two years. Members may serve for not more than two successive terms in each office. The council enacts legislation, adopts budgets, establishes policies and appoints the city manager, city secretary, city municipal court judges, prosecutors, and clerks.

The City Council appoints the city manager to carry out the operations of the city. The city secretary maintains ordinances, resolutions, meeting minutes, and legally required publications. The city attorney gives the city council general counsel, litigation, contract review, and ordinance review.
West University Place&#x27;s sewage treatment plant and animal pound are located on a lot in Houston.

The West University Place Fire Department is headquartered at 3800 University Boulevard. Adam Ohler, a firefighter at the department, said in a 2009 &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; article that the pace of work in the department is &quot;a lot slower than in other city stations—certainly slower than the Provo Fire Department, where I moved from, or some of Houston&#x27;s units, whose guys run twenty to thirty calls a day.&quot; The West University Place Police Department is also now headquartered at 3800 University Boulevard following a large two-story addition completed in the summer of 2011. The old police department building was torn down and replaced with a large parking lot. In 2018 Swartz stated that &quot;The police department is famous Houston-wide for enforcing speed limits with a vengeance.&quot;

There was a plan to sell the West University maintenance facility, but city council suspended the proposed sale in 2014.

====Local politics====
In 2001 Kathleen &quot;Kathy&quot; Ballanfant, the publisher and editor of the &quot;Village News and Southwest News&quot;, stated that &quot;There&#x27;s a long tradition in West University of not letting your partisan affiliation influence what happens. If you have committed your volunteer time in Little League and the city and various other things, it doesn&#x27;t matter what political party you&#x27;re in.&quot;

The city enforces a ban prohibiting drivers around West University Elementary School from talking on mobile phones during school zone hours. AT&amp;T tried and failed to persuade the city to not apply the ban. The West University City Council voted 5–0 to establish the ban; a person who violates the ban gets a $500 fine. In 2008 the &quot;Houston Press&quot; rated this ban as the &quot;Best New Ordinance&quot;.

In December 2009 the city voted to ban texting while driving. Bans of texting while driving were passed in West University Place and Bellaire within hours of one another.

In 2019 there was a proposal to reduce the number of hours in which landscapers were allowed to work, as a way of reducing noise, but it failed three to two.

==Parks and recreation==

In 2018 Swartz stated that the area recreational facilities had &quot;secure, nontoxic equipment.&quot; From 1988 to 2003 the Friends of West University Place Parks Fund Inc., a volunteer board, and several West University-area businesses and residents raised $1.5 million to improve West University parks. The funds were collected to acquire additional green spaces and redevelop existing parks.

The first West University Place Recreation Center, formerly the Southwest YMCA, included a gymnasium, a swimming pool, and lighted sports fields. The City of West University had purchased the Southwest YMCA property around 2003. In 2008 residents approved a bond to build a new $8.8 million recreation center at a plot of land bounded by Bellaire Boulevard, Community, and Westpoint. The new recreation center does not have basketball courts; however, the center has a swimming pool, a weight room, a cardiovascular room, and racquetball courts. Additionally, classes such as yoga, jazzercize, and dance are offered for a fee. Russ Schulze, the chairperson of the Parks and Recreation department of West University Place, said that the city wants to construct a recreation center &quot;for our residents, not something that will compete with nearby fitness centers or the Weekley YMCA, or to merely attract what residents outside West University want.&quot; Current policy denies admission to the pool or other facilities to non-residents unless physically accompanied by a resident at all times .

The Weekley YMCA in Houston, the current YMCA facility, includes West University Place in its service area. It opened in 1951 as the Southwest YMCA. The current facility in Braeswood Place, Houston broke ground in 2001.

Colonial Park, at 4130 Byron Street, has a park and a recreational center. The park has a playground, a picnic area, two tennis courts, a parkour course, a concrete walking path, and a pavilion. By 2003 Colonial Park had been enlarged and several facilities, such as a playground, pool, and tennis courts, had been added, due to efforts from the Friends of West University Place Parks and its allies. On May 11, 2009, the West University Place city council approved the design of the new Colonial Park pool, which was completed in 2011. Colonial Park Pool is open May through September, while the recreational center is open year-round.

Friends Park, formerly the Rice Pocket Park, is located at 3771 Rice Boulevard. The park, the newest in the city, opened on December 11, 2007. Huffington Park, located at 3901 Milton Street, has a playground, a shaded arbor, picnic tables, and game tables. Whitt Johnson Park, at 6540 Wakeforest Street, has a playground, a gazebo, a picnic area, and a lighted basketball court. Judson Park, at 4242 South Judson Street, has a playground, a picnic area, a lighted tennis court, and a concrete walking path. Wier Park, at 3012 Nottingham Street, has a playground, picnic tables, two lighted tennis courts, and a basketball court.

In 2002 West University&#x27;s little league team was placed in the same league as the Bellaire team. Previously they played in separate leagues.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary schools===
====Public schools====
The city is within the Houston Independent School District (HISD). In 2018 Swartz described the area schools as &quot;well funded and well appointed.&quot;

Pupils who live in West University Place are zoned to West University Elementary School in West University Place, Pershing Middle School in the Braeswood Place neighborhood of Houston, and Lamar High School, in the Upper Kirby district of Houston. All pupils zoned to Pershing may attend Pin Oak Middle School (in the city of Bellaire) instead. Pin Oak was named a National Blue Ribbon School in 2008.

West University Elementary opened in 1925, although its permanent facility was not yet complete at the time; Platte School initially took its non-kindergarten students while the sales office of Southside Place housed kindergarten students. The permanent facility has a Spanish Renaissance architectural style and was financed by a $55,000 bond. The majority of the land that housed the school was donated by D. T. Austin and W. D. Haden. In the 1970s and 1980s West University parents reshaped West University Elementary, which Tim Fleck of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; described as &quot;deteriorating&quot;, into &quot;a community focal point that kept many West U children in public school through the fifth grade.&quot; West University Elementary School, by the 1990s, became what Fleck described as &quot;the prototype of how the increasingly minority district could maintain the allegiance of affluent whites&quot; and &quot;a selling point for parents moving into the area.&quot; In 1996 37% of West University Elementary students had transferred there from other schools. In 2015 West U Elementary had 1,274 students, making it HISD&#x27;s largest elementary school, with 96% of the students living inside the attendance zone.

 about 600 students who were zoned to West University Elementary School were enrolled in Pin Oak Middle School or Lanier Middle School, opting for those schools instead of Pershing, their zoned school. In 2010 two parents, Adrienne Vanderbloemen and Christi Young, started a blog that supported the idea of sending one&#x27;s child to Pershing Middle School.

West University Place is in close proximity to The Rice School, a kindergarten through 8th grade magnet school in Houston. The Rice School opened in August 1994 to relieve West University Elementary School and several nearby campuses.

Gabriela Mistral Early Childhood Center is the closest public early childhood center to the city of West University Place. Students who are eligible for HISD&#x27;s preschools may attend any Early Childhood Center in Houston ISD.

====Private schools====
St. Mark&#x27;s Episcopal School (K–8) is located within West University Place. The Beehive Preschool Center is located at the West University Church of Christ.

Other nearby parochial schools and private schools include the School of St. Vincent De Paul Catholic Church in Houston (adjacent to the city limits), St. John&#x27;s School in Houston, Episcopal High School in Bellaire, St. Francis Episcopal Day School (Texas) in Piney Point, and The Post Oak School with campuses in Bellaire and Houston. Local Catholic schools for girls include Incarnate Word Academy, St. Agnes Academy and Duchesne Academy, and are joined by the all-boys schools of Strake Jesuit and St. Thomas High School. The Village School in the Energy Corridor area has a bus service to an area along Westpark, via Royal Oaks Country Club. This stop serves students living in West University Place.

===Colleges and universities===
The Texas Legislature designated Houston Community College System (HCC) as serving Houston ISD (including West University Place). West University Place is also served by University of Houston and is in close proximity to Rice University.

===Public libraries===

The Harris County Public Library system operates the West University Branch Library in West University Place. The library opened in a section of the West University Community Center in 1942. As World War II continued the library was moved into the Reed and Yancey Realtors field office. After the war ended the library moved back into the community center. The current library facility opened in 1963.

==Media==
The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; is the area regional newspaper. On Thursdays, residents receive the Bellaire/West U/River Oaks/Meyerland local section.

The &quot;West University Examiner&quot; is a local newspaper distributed in the community. &quot;The West University Buzz&quot; is a monthly publication about people, products and services in the community.

The &quot;Village News and Southwest News&quot; is a local newspaper distributed to houses and businesses in the community.

In the mid-20th century the community newspaper &quot;Southwestern Times&quot; served West U and surrounding communities. The paper was headquartered in Rice Village, and it served as an official publication for the city.

==Transportation==
West University Place is a member city of the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas (METRO). The city is served by bus lines 2 (Bellaire), 10 (Willowbend), 41 (Kirby/Polk), 65 (Bissonnet), 84 (Buffalo Speedway), and 402 (Bellaire Quickline).

<text>Hallsville is a city in Harrison County, Texas, United States, located west of the county seat, Marshall, on U.S. Highway 80. The population was 3,577 at the 2010 census, up from 2,772 at the 2000 census. The 2020 census revealed that Hallsville&#x27;s population was 4,277.

== History ==
===Past===

The area was first settled in 1839, when Fort Crawford was built one mile west of the site of present Hallsville by W. C. Crawford as a protection against Indians. In 1849, the fort is reported to have had a post office and a two-story building that served as church, Masonic hall, and school (the only school in western Harrison County until 1868). In 1869, when an independent Southern Pacific Railway crossed a mile north of Fort Crawford, the settlers moved to the railroad and named the new settlement for a railroad official. All that remains at the original location is a cemetery.

A post office named &quot;Hallville&quot; opened in 1869, and the first business in the new community was a saloon. From 1869 to 1872 the town was the terminus of the railroad, and the railroad company built a general office and machine shops there. The community incorporated for the first time in 1870 and was a boom town, with as many as fifty businesses, in the early 1870s. Hallville shipped cotton, wool, and hides. In 1872, when the Texas and Pacific acquired the railroad and built out to Longview in Gregg County, Hallville lost much of its western trade. In 1873, the railroad moved its local headquarters and shops to Marshall. Hallville&#x27;s incorporation lapsed, and the community lost many of its people to Marshall in the later 1870s. In 1884, it had an estimated 600 inhabitants, three churches, six sawmills, six grist mill-gins, a hotel, two saloons, and a cooperative association. By 1892 the population had fallen to 300, but it recovered to 600 in the 1900s. In 1904, the Hallville school district had two schools serving 180 white pupils and one school serving 111 black pupils Galilee High School. A bank opened in the community in 1909. In the 1920s, the post office changed the spelling of its name to Hallsville. The community reincorporated in 1935.

===Present===
Until 2003, Hallsville had only one traffic light, located at the main intersection at Main Street (HWY 80) and FM 450. The town has experienced rapid growth in the past decade and now boasts six traffic lights, a larger corporate grocery store chain, a medical and dental clinic, two dollar stores and several fast-food chains. The heart and pulse of the community still lies in its school functions, particularly sporting events.

<text>Marshall is a city in the U.S. state of Texas. It is the county seat of Harrison County and a cultural and educational center of the Ark-La-Tex region. At the 2020 U.S. census, the population of Marshall was 23,392. The population of the Greater Marshall area, comprising all of Harrison County, was 65,631 in 2010 and 66,726 in 2018.

Marshall and Harrison County were important political and production areas of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. This area of Texas was developed for cotton plantations. Planters brought slaves with them from other regions or bought them in the domestic slave trade. The county had the highest number of slaves in the state, and East Texas had a higher proportion of slaves than other regions of the state. The wealth of the county and city depended on slave labor and the cotton market.

The late 19th century until the mid-20th century, Marshall developed as a large railroad center of the Texas and Pacific Railway. Following World War II, activists in the city&#x27;s substantial African-American population worked to create social change through the Civil Rights Movement, with considerable support from the historically black colleges and universities in the area.

The city is known for holding one of the largest light festivals in the United States, the &quot;Wonderland of Lights&quot;. It identifies as the self-proclaimed &quot;Pottery Capital of the World&quot;, for its sizable pottery industry. Marshall is referred to by various nicknames: the &quot;Cultural Capital of East Texas&quot;, the &quot;Gateway of Texas&quot;, the &quot;Athens of Texas&quot;, the &quot;City of Seven Flags&quot;, and &quot;Center Stage&quot;, a branding slogan adopted by the Marshall Convention and Visitors Bureau.

==History==
===Republic of Texas and Civil War (1841–1860)===
The city was founded in 1841 as the seat of Harrison County after failed attempts to establish a county seat on the Sabine River. It was incorporated in 1843. The Republic of Texas decided to choose the land donated for the seat by Peter Whetstone and Isaac Van Zandt after Whetstone had proven that the hilly location had a good water source.

The city quickly became a major city in the state because of its position as a gateway to Texas; it was on the route of several major stagecoach lines. Later, one of the first railroad lines constructed into Texas ran through it.

The founding of several colleges, including a number of seminaries, teaching colleges, and incipient universities, earned Marshall the nickname &quot;the Athens of Texas&quot;, in reference to the ancient Greek city-state. The city&#x27;s growing importance was confirmed when Marshall was linked by a telegraph line to New Orleans; it was the first city in Texas to have a telegraph service.

By 1860, Marshall was the fourth-largest city in Texas and the seat of its richest county. Developing the land for cotton plantations, county planters held more slaves here than in any other county in the state. Many planters and other whites were strongly against the Union because of their investment in slavery.

When Governor Sam Houston refused to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederate States of America, Marshall&#x27;s Edward Clark was sworn in as governor. Pendleton Murrah, Texas&#x27;s third Confederate governor, was also from Marshall.

The city became a major Confederate supply depot and manufacturer of gunpowder for the Confederate Army. It hosted three conferences of Trans-Mississippi and Indian Territory leaders.

The exiled Confederate government of Missouri established Marshall as its temporary capital. The city took the nickname of the &quot;City of Seven Flags&quot;. This was a nod to the flag of Missouri, in addition to the six flags of the varying nations and republics that have flown over the city.

Also during the Civil War, after the fall of Vicksburg, Marshall became the seat of Confederate civil authority and headquarters of the Trans-Mississippi Postal Department. The city may have been the intended target of a failed Union advance that was rebuffed at Mansfield, Louisiana.

Toward the end of the American Civil War, the Confederate government had $9.0 million in treasury notes and $3.0 million in postage stamps shipped to Marshall. They may have intended Marshall as the destination of a government preparing to flee from advancing armies.

===Reconstruction and the railroad era (1865–1895)===
Marshall was occupied by Union forces on June 17, 1865. During Reconstruction, the city was home to an office of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau and was the base for federal troops in the region. In 1873 the Methodist Episcopal Church founded Wiley College to educate freedmen. African Americans came to the city seeking opportunities and protection until 1878.

Although freedmen comprised the majority of voters in the county and supported the Republican Party, establishing a bi-racial government, in the post-Reconstruction era, the White Citizens Party, led by former Confederate General Walter P. Lane and his brother George, took control of the city and county governments by fraud and intimidation at elections. Their militia ran Unionists, Republicans and many African Americans out of town. The Lanes ultimately declared Marshall and Harrison County &quot;redeemed&quot; from Union and African-American control.

Despite this, the African-American community continued to progress. The historically black Bishop College was founded in 1881, and Wiley College was certified by the Freedman&#x27;s Aid Society in 1882.

Marshall&#x27;s &quot;Railroad Era&quot; began in the early 1870s. Harrison County citizens voted to offer a $300,000 bond subsidy, and the City of Marshall offered to donate land north of the downtown to the Texas and Pacific Railway if the company would establish a center in Marshall. T&amp;P President Jay Gould accepted the business incentive, locating the T&amp;P&#x27;s workshops and general offices for Texas in Marshall. The city immediately had a population explosion from workers attracted to the potential for new jobs there.

By 1880, the city was one of the South&#x27;s largest cotton markets, with crops and other products shipped by the railroad. The city&#x27;s prosperity attracted new businesses: J. Weisman and Co. opened here as the first department store in Texas. When one light bulb was installed in the Texas and Pacific Depot, Marshall became the first city in Texas to have electricity. During this period of wealth, many of the city&#x27;s now historic homes were constructed. The city&#x27;s most prominent industry, pottery manufacturing, began with the establishment of Marshall Pottery in 1895.

Despite the prosperity of the railroad era, some city residents struggled with poverty. Blacks were severely discriminated against under what was known as Jim Crow laws and customs. At the turn of the 20th century, the Democratic-dominated state legislature passed segregation laws and disenfranchised most blacks and Hispanics, as did all the states of the former Confederacy in this period. These minorities were essentially excluded from the political system for more than 60 years. Unable to vote, they were also excluded from juries and suffered injustices from all-white juries. In addition, from 1877 to 1950, Harrison County had 14 lynchings, most in the early 20th century, and more than any other county in Texas.

In the rural areas of Harrison County, more interaction occurred between whites and African-Americans than in the city, and whites and blacks were often neighbors. However, Jim Crow rules were strongly imposed on African-Americans.

=== Early and mid-20th century ===
In 1909, a field of natural gas was discovered near Caddo Lake; it was exploited to supply city needs. Under the leadership of John L. Lancaster, the Texas and Pacific Railway enjoyed its height of success during the first half of the 20th century. Marshall&#x27;s ceramics industry expanded to the point that the city was called by boosters the &quot;Pottery Capital of the World&quot;.

In 1930, what was then the largest oil field in the world was discovered at nearby Kilgore. The first student at Marshall High School to have a car was Lady Bird Johnson, a kind of progress that excited many students.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, children of both races were forced into accepting the law of racial segregation in the state. Marshall resident George Dawson became a writer late in life when he learned to read and write at age 98. He described his childhood under segregation in his memoir &quot;Life Is So Good&quot;(2013), written with Richard Glaubman. He said that in some instances, he and other Blacks resisted the demands of Jim Crow. For instance, he rejected one employer who expected him to eat with her dogs.

As blacks were being excluded from politics and tensions rose, more lynchings of black men took place, a form of extrajudicial punishment and social control. Beginning in the late 19th century, a total of 14 Black men were lynched in the county, the third-highest total in the state. Suspects were often brought to Marshall for the lynchings, or taken from the county jail before trial and hanged in the courthouse square for maximum public effect of terrorizing the black population. Between October 1903 and August 1917, at least 12 black men were lynched in Marshall. Not all instances of lynching were documented, so there may have been others.

In the early and mid-20th century, Marshall&#x27;s traditionally black colleges, Wiley and Bishop, were thriving intellectual and cultural centers. The writer Melvin B. Tolson, who was part of the Harlem Renaissance in New York City, taught at Wiley College. Painter Samuel Countee, a Texas-born student of Bishop College in the mid-1930s, exhibited at the Harmon Exhibitions in 1935–1937 and won a scholarship to study at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Countee had a successful career as a teacher and artist in the New York City area, where he lived for the rest of his life.

Inspired by the teachings of professors such as Tolson, students and former students of the colleges mobilized to challenge and dismantle Jim Crow laws and institutions in the 1950s and 1960s. Fred Lewis, as the secretary of the Harrison County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), challenged the White Citizens Party in Harrison County, which had the oldest chapter in Texas, and the laws the party supported. This suit overturned Jim Crow in the county with the &quot;Perry v. Cyphers&quot; ruling. Heman Sweatt, a Wiley graduate, tried to enroll in the University of Texas at Austin Law School, but was denied entry because of his race. He sued and the United States Supreme Court ordered the desegregation of postgraduate studies in public universities in Texas in its ruling in &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot; (1950). James Farmer, another Wiley graduate, became an organizer of the Freedom Rides and a founder of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), which was active throughout the South.

===Late 20thearly 21st centuries===
The Civil Rights Movement reached into the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. In the 1960s, students organized the first sit-ins in Texas, in the rotunda of the county courthouse on Whetstone Square. They protested continuing segregation of public schools. This governmental practice had been declared unconstitutional in 1954 by the US Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. In 1970, all Marshall public schools were finally integrated.

Also in that year, Carolyn Abney became the first woman to be elected to the Marshall City Commission. In April 1975, nearly a decade after passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, local businessman Sam Birmingham became the first African American to be elected to the city commission. In the 1980s, he was elected as the city&#x27;s first African-American mayor. Birmingham retired in 1989 for health concerns and was succeeded by his wife, Jean Birmingham.

Marshall&#x27;s railroad industry declined during the restructuring of the industry; most trains were converted to diesel fuel, and many lines merged. Construction of the Interstate Highway System after World War II and expansion of trucking, plus the increase in airline traffic, also led to railway declines. The T&amp;P shops closed in the 1960s, and T&amp;P passenger service ceased in 1970. The Texas oil bust of the 1980s devastated the local economy. The city&#x27;s population declined by about 1,000 between 1980 and 1990.

During the mid-20th century, the city lost many of its historic landmarks to redevelopment or neglect. For a time people preferred &quot;modern&quot; structures. Other buildings were demolished because tax laws favored new construction.

By 1990, Marshall&#x27;s opera house, the Missouri Capitol, the Moses Montefiore Synagogue, the original Viaduct, the Capitol Hotel, and the campus of Bishop College (including the Wyalucing plantation house) had been demolished. In the 1970s, the city began to study historic preservation efforts of nearby Jefferson. Since then it has emphasized preservation of historic assets.

Due to newly completed construction projects, the city was one of 10 designated in 1976 as an All-America City by the National Civic League. In 1978, Taipei mayor Lee Teng-hui, and Marshall mayor William Q. Burns, signed legislation recognizing Marshall as a sister city to the much larger Taipei. During this period, Bill Moyers won an Emmy for his documentary, &quot;Marshall, Texas: Marshall, Texas,&quot; chronicling the history of race relations in the city.

In terms of the city&#x27;s economy, the 1960s through 1980s were a period of decline, largely because of the oil industry and manufacturing changes. Population declined after jobs left the area. Longview surpassed Marshall in population and economy.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the city began to concentrate on diversifying its economy. It has emphasized heritage and other tourism. The city founded two new festivals, the Fire Ant Festival, and the &quot;Wonderland of Lights&quot;, which joined the longstanding Stagecoach Days. The Fire Ant Festival gained national attention through being featured on television in programs such as &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show.&quot;

The &quot;Wonderland of Lights&quot; became the most popular and one of the largest light festivals in the United States. By 2000, the &quot;Wonderland of Lights&quot; had become such a part of the cityscape that the lighted dome of the Old Courthouse was the most recognizable symbol of the city. 2011 marked the 25th anniversary of the &quot;Wonderland of Lights&quot; festival.

During the 2000s, the downtown area experienced moderate economic growth, which supported restoration of significant buildings. By 2005, the Joe Weisman &amp; Company building, the T&amp;P Depot, the former Hotel Marshall (now known as &quot;The Marshall&quot;), and the former Harrison County Courthouse were either restored or under restoration.

Restaurants, boutiques, and loft apartments were developed in downtown, adding to the variety of its daily life and the number of pedestrians on the streets. Some projects adapted historic structures for reuse. Many historic homes outside of downtown continue to deteriorate. Some structures in moderate condition were approved for demolition for replacement by prefabricated or tin structures. Whetstone Square has become quite busy again, with few empty buildings around it. Lack of funding and manpower has slowed movement on demolition and salvage of historic homes.

The Sam B. Hall, Jr. Federal Courthouse has been the venue for several cases challenging state practices under provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. For instance, the Democratic Party challenged the 2003 redistricting by the state legislature, arguing that it diluted minority rights. Combined with two other cases, these issues were heard by the United States Supreme Court in &quot;League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry&quot; (2006). It upheld the state&#x27;s actions, with the exception of Texas&#x27;s 23rd congressional district; redistricting was required that affected neighboring districts, as well. This had little effect on the new Republican majority of the Texas Congressional delegation after the 2004 elections.

An unusually high number of patent lawsuits were being filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, which includes Marshall, Tyler, and Texarkana. TiVo sued EchoStar over digital video recorder patent rights. Marshall has a reputation for plaintiff-friendly juries for the 5% of patent lawsuits that reach trial. This has resulted in 78% plaintiff wins. The number of patent suits filed in 2002 was 32, and the number for 2006 was estimated at 234.

The patent suits filed here were second-highest in number, after the United States District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles in 2009. The trend continued through 2011 in the Eastern District of Texas, which includes Marshall, with the number of patent lawsuits more than doubling from 2010.

Marshall was profiled on &quot;This American Life&quot;, as its juries&#x27; support of plaintiffs in patent suits has generated controversy.

On January 18, 2010, Dr. John Tennison, a San Antonio physician and musicologist, publicized his research that found that boogie-woogie music was first developed in the Marshall area in the early 1870s. It originated among African Americans working with the T&amp;P Railroad and the logging industry. On May 13, 2010, the Marshall City Commission unanimously passed an ordinance declaring Marshall to be &quot;the Birthplace of Boogie Woogie&quot;. On September 2, 2018, the Harrison County Historic Commission unveiled a state Texas Historic Marker that declares Marshall as the birthplace of Boogie Woogie.

== Government ==

=== Local government ===
The City of Marshall has a council–manager form of municipal government, with all governmental powers resting in a legislative body called the City Council. The council passes all city laws and ordinances, adopts budgets, determines city policy, and appoints city officials, including the city manager, who serves as the executive of the city government and is in charge of enforcing city laws and administering the city&#x27;s various departments.

=== City council ===
The city council has seven members, each elected from a single-member district. Districts 1−4 divide the city into four districts, and the districts 5−7 divide the city into three districts that overlay Districts 1−4. So, every location in the city falls in two districts, one from each set. Each council member is elected to a two-year term. Districts 1−4 hold elections in odd-numbered years and districts 5−7 in even years; elections are held in the spring.

After each election, the city council selects a council member to serve as chairman, generically called a mayor, until after the next year&#x27;s election. If no one files to run against a council member, as happened with District 1 in 2005, the council member is reinstated and an election for that district is not held that year.

The city council meets twice a month on the second and fourth Thursdays. Additional special sessions may be called or regular meetings cancelled. The Council provides a public forum before each regular session providing citizens the opportunity to address the commission for two minutes without forward notice; with notice, additional time may be scheduled. The council meetings are broadcast on radio and on the local government-access television, public-access television cable TV station.

The team challenged the Harvard University debate team on the national circuit. In reality, Melvin B.

<doc id="136031" wikidata="Q969705" url="?curid=136031" title="Waskom, Texas">
<text>Waskom is a city in the U.S. state of Texas with a 2020 census-tabulated population of 1,910, down from 2,160 residents in 2010. It is located in Harrison County and lies approximately east of the county seat, Marshall, on U.S. 80 and Interstate 20. Waskom forms part of Greater Marshall, which is also included in the Longview–Marshall combined statistical area in the Ark-La-Tex region. To the east are the cities of Greenwood and Shreveport, Louisiana.

==History==
The city of Waskom was established in 1850 as Powell Town, presumably for Jonathan S. Powell, who owned a land grant in the area. It was founded as a midway point for an east-west (Dallas to Shreveport) cattle and cotton economic trail to the Red River in Louisiana.

From 1850 to 1872 it had a post office as Powellton. In 1872, it became a main railroad station between Dallas, Texarkana, and Shreveport. The city&#x27;s named was changed to Waskom Station in 1872 and to Waskom in 1881 after J. M. Waskom, a director of the Southern Pacific Railroad.

In 2014 and 2015, Waskom High School won the 3A D2 state title in football.

In June 2019, the city council voted to outlaw abortion in the city, declaring Waskom a &quot;sanctuary city for the unborn&quot; (the first such city to designate itself as such), as state governments elsewhere in the United States also were drafting abortion bans. There is currently no abortion clinic in the city. The Waskom ordinance has led other small cities in Texas (and, as of April 2021, in Nebraska) to vote in favor of becoming &quot;sanctuary cities for the unborn.&quot; In May 2021, Lubbock became the largest Texas city to ban abortion following Waskom.

==Geography==

Waskom is located in eastern Harrison County. The eastern border of the city is the Texas–Louisiana border. Interstate 20 provides access to the city from Exit 633 on the west side and Exit 635 to the south. Interstate 20 leads east to Shreveport and west to Dallas.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The city drains to the north towards Paw Paw Bayou and to the south towards tributaries of Cross Bayou. Both bayous run east to Cross Lake, which flows out to the Red River in Shreveport.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 1,910 people, 589 households, and 436 families residing in the city.

In 2018 there was an estimated population of 1,887, a decrease of 273 inhabitants since the 2010 census.

<text>Channing is a town in Hartley County, Texas, in the United States. It is the county seat of Hartley County. As of the 2020 United States census, the town&#x27;s population was 281.

==History==

Channing was founded in 1888 by George Channing Rivers, a paymaster for the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway. The settlement was originally called Rivers. Since the name Rivers duplicated another community in Texas, the name was changed to Channing later that year. Channing developed directly from its association with the XIT Ranch, a property that once included land in as many as 10 counties in the Texas Panhandle.

In 1891, Willis D. Twitchell platted Channing&#x27;s business district. At that time, Channing was the headquarters of the XIT. Albert Boyce, the ranch&#x27;s general manager and one of the most prominent early citizens, built the first house in the community. By 1900, Channing had two stores, a post office, lumber yard, and school.

Two elections, one in November 1896 and the other in 1903, were required for Channing to replace Hartley as county seat. The frame courthouse was pulled to Channing on wheels by mounted XIT cowboys in 1903. A brick courthouse was completed in 1906 and the original courthouse was converted into the once-famous Hotel Rivers. One of the first public libraries in the Panhandle was established in 1908 by a local women&#x27;s club. The estimated population at this time was about 600.

The XIT, which conducted most of its business from Channing, was the town&#x27;s chief customer until liquidation of the ranch in 1911. The local economy was severely impacted, although the real-estate market temporarily thrived from the sale of XIT lands. A fire swept through the business district on September 6, 1931, destroying seven buildings, including Hotel Rivers. By 1940, Channing had an estimated population of 475 with several businesses, a high school, and three churches. A restored XIT office building is located in Channing as a museum.

Channing was incorporated in 1960. At the time of incorporation, the population was 390. The number of inhabitants declined to 336 in 1970, 304 in 1980, and 277 in 1990, mainly because of its accessibility to the larger communities of Dalhart and Amarillo. By 2000, the population rose to 356, a 28.5% increase over the 1990 figure.

== Government services ==
City government consists of a mayor and two city council members. Mayor Troy Williams was elected in May 2021. Current council members are Preston Mead and Jacob Vincent.

Law enforcement is provided by the Hartley County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, as the city does not have a police force of its own. Fire protection for the city and much of southern Hartley County is provided by an all-volunteer fire department, headquartered in the city.

As of October 2009, a limited number of businesses operated in the city: a cafe, a mercantile, and a rendering plant. Most citizens were either involved in ranching, dairy, or other agricultural professions, or were employed in businesses in surrounding communities.

<text>Hartley is a census-designated place (CDP) in Hartley County, Texas, United States. The population was 540 at the 2010 census.

==History==

In 1832, John Charles Beales and Jose Manuel Royella were granted the section where Hartley is now located under colonization laws of Mexico and Texas. They represented the Arkansas and Texas Land Company; however, they failed to colonize this territory and they forfeited their rights.

In 1875, the Texas Legislature passed an act which allowed contractors to clear one mile of the river Sabine, Angeline, and Neches, and the Pine Island Bayou in exchange for land grants. The contractors were required to survey the land, return field notes to the Land Commissioner and request him to number the sections. The contractors then received a deed to the uneven numbered sections with the State retaining the even-numbered ones as school lands. The field notes of Beaty, Seale, and Forwood were filed November 17, 1875. The only other deeds registered in the county prior to 1884 were those of the Fort Worth and Denver Railroad, Brooks and Burleson, Gunter and Burleson and W.M. Lee. On July 1, 1888, Beaty, Seale, and Forwood sold Section 23 to James A. Hudson of Logan County, Illinois and John A. Lutz of New York for $10,000.00. They sold the right of way to the Fort Worth and Denver Railroad July 1, 1888.

Many changes occurred in a very short time. Handbills were distributed throughout the eastern and southern states by the owners who were anxious to turn Hartley into a booming metropolis. Section 23 was plotted into lots and registered with the Land Commissioner of Texas. A tent city came into being and grew rapidly as people came with high expectations and determination to make for themselves a new life in a new land.

<doc id="136040" wikidata="Q379043" url="?curid=136040" title="Buda, Texas">
<text>Buda ( ) is a city in Hays County, Texas, United States. The population was 15,108 in 2020, an increase over the figure of 7,295 tabulated in 2010. Buda is part of the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos metropolitan statistical area and is one of Austin&#x27;s fastest growing suburbs.

==History==
The town of Buda sprang up along the route of the International-Great Northern Railroad, which was extended from Austin to San Antonio in 1880. Buda bore the name of &quot;Du Pre&quot; from its birth in 1881 until the autumn of 1887, when postal officials became aware that another Texas town was also named Du Pre. Cornelia Trimble platted the town of Du Pre on April 1, 1881, establishing streets and a wide &quot;Reservation&quot; between the lots and the railroad right of way, which allowed the railroad to place buildings on the parkland, including the depot that would become the lifeblood of the town over the next few decades. Several businesses sprang up, including the Carrington Hotel, which served meals to railroad travelers. By the time Du Pre found a new name for itself, the Carrington hotel was known as the &quot;Buda House&quot;. The &quot;Dupre Notes&quot; column of the Sept. 25, 1886, edition of the &quot;Hays County Times and Farmer&#x27;s Journal&quot; notes that &quot;The Buda House is one of the best hotels in the state. The polite and entertaining hostess, Mrs. Carrington, meets all with a courteous welcome.&quot; According to the town&#x27;s oral tradition, &quot;Buda&quot; is a corruption of the Spanish word &quot;viuda&quot;, or &quot;widow&quot;, referencing the widows who supposedly worked as cooks at the Carrington Hotel. Others suggest that like the town of Buda, Illinois, the town name is a nod to the exiles of the failed Hungarian Revolution of 1848 who settled in the area.

Buda was incorporated in 1948. By the mid-1980s it had attracted a cement plant and some craft industry.

==Geography==
Buda is in northeastern Hays County. It is southwest of downtown Austin and northeast of San Antonio on Interstate 35. Just to the north of Buda is Texas State Highway 45, a major toll loop of Austin. Almost immediately north of Buda is the county line bordering Travis County and the Austin city limits.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Buda has a total area of , of which , or 0.11%, are water. Onion Creek flows through the northwest side of the city, a tributary of the Colorado River.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 15,108 people, 5,827 households, and 4,314 families residing in the city.

As of the census of 2000, there were 2,404 people, 866 households, and 685 families residing in the city. Based on utility hook-ups, the city estimated its 2008 population to be in excess of 5,000 residents. The population density was . There were 910 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 81.95% White, 1.58% African American, 0.54% Native American, 0.87% Asian, 12.02% from other races, and 3.04% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 26.83% of the population.

There were 866 households, out of which 44.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 65.5% were married couples living together, 10.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.8% were non-families. 17.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.78 and the average family size was 3.13.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 29.7% under the age of 18, 6.4% from 18 to 24, 36.7% from 25 to 44, 19.7% from 45 to 64, and 7.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.3 males.

The city recorded more than $3 million in sales tax collection in 2006, for a per capita sales tax collection of $675.

==Economy==
Buda is home to numerous fast-growing small- to medium-sized businesses.

==Arts and culture==
Buda is a commuter town south of Austin. Commercial development along the I-35 corridor, such as the Cabela&#x27;s sporting goods store, has increased city sales tax revenue, and city leaders hope that further revitalization of downtown Buda will attract tourists and residents to the Main Street area.

Buda attracts national attention for its lighthearted wiener dog races, organized every April by the Buda Lions Club. Rooster Teeth Productions, the creators of the machinima series &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; and &quot;The Strangerhood&quot;, had its office in Buda until moving back to Austin.

==Government==
Buda is a home rule city with a council-manager form of government. Other governmental entities include the Buda Planning and Zoning Commission, the Historical Commission, the Parks Commission, the Board of Adjustments and the Economic Development Corporation. Citizen Groups active in local politics include the Buda Area Chamber of Commerce and the Buda Downtown Merchants Association.

In November 2007, Buda citizens adopted a home rule charter by a margin of 77.85 percent, allowing the city to transition from general law to home rule.

==Education==
Buda is served by the Hays Consolidated Independent School District. Buda Elementary, built in 1885, sits just outside Main Street and serves 500 students from the Buda area.

<text>Kyle is a city in Hays County, Texas, United States. Its population grew from 28,016 in 2010 to 45,697 in 2020, making it one of Texas&#x27; fastest-growing cities. It is part of the Greater Austin area.

==Geography==
Kyle is in eastern Hays County and is bordered to the south by San Marcos and to the northwest by Mountain City. Kyle is southwest of downtown Austin and northeast of San Antonio on Interstate 35.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and , 1.06%, is covered by water. The Blanco River runs through the western side of the city, while the central and eastern parts of the city drain east to Plum Creek. Both waterways are tributaries of the San Marcos River.

==Education==
The longest-active school building in Kyle was built in 1939 as part of the then-Kyle Independent School District, later named Kyle High School and today known as Kyle Elementary School following the construction of Jack C. Hays High School in 1964, named after the same Jack C. Hays that gives the school district, now Hays Consolidated Independent School District, its namesake. High-school students have since attended either Jack C. Hays High School, Lehman High School (since opening in 2004), or Johnson High School located in neighboring Buda (opened in 2019).

In higher education, Kyle sits just seven miles (11 km) north of Texas State University located in San Marcos and is home to the Hays campus of the Austin Community College District which has been fully operational since 2014 with the college district&#x27;s Public Safety Training Center opening a few years afterward.

==Transportation==

Austin–Bergstrom International Airport is northeast of Kyle, San Marcos Regional Airport is to the south, and San Antonio International Airport is to the southwest. 

The MoPac rail line runs through downtown Kyle but currently there is no stop in Kyle. The Amtrak Texas Eagle passenger rail line has a stop located south of Kyle in San Marcos.

Residents have access to I-35, SH 45 toll road, FM 150, FM 1626, SH 21, and SH 123.

The Kyle city council in September 2021 approved of a citywide trail system known as The Vybe to connect city residents with a mix of dirt, crushed granite, and paved trails along with existing roadways and trails.

==Highways==
* - Connects northbound to Buda and Austin; southbound to San Marcos, New Braunfels, and San Antonio
* - Connects to Driftwood and Dripping Springs to the northwest and Uhland to the southeast
* - Connects to the outer parts of Buda, Hays, and Manchaca

== Government and infrastructure ==

The city of Kyle is governed by a council-manager form of government. The city council consists of three members representing geographical districts, three at-large council members, and the mayor, who is also elected at-large. Each council member is elected to three-year terms.

=== State and federal representation ===
The Management and Training Corporation operates the Kyle Unit, a prison for men in Kyle, on behalf of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. In 1988, the construction of Kyle Unit, the first private prison for the TDCJ, sparked controversy. The Kyle Unit became the second-largest employer in Kyle, after the Hays Consolidated Independent School District. In 1989, the prison had a $50,000 weekly payroll, with much of it going to the city&#x27;s residents.

The United States Postal Service operates the Kyle Post Office.

==History==
As part of railroad expansion along the International-Great Northern Railroad (I&amp;GN), railroad tycoon and entrepreneur, Jay Gould, found an opportunity for additional revenue between the cities of Austin and San Marcos which were lined with cotton fields and livestock farms. Originally, the line railline was to cross over to Mountain City, located three miles north of Kyle, but when addressing with his secretary, Ira Evans, it was seen as more cost effective to build a straight track from Austin to San Marcos which went right through the private lands of Fergus Kyle and his wife, Anne Moore. Following an agreement between the I&amp;GN and the Kyle and Moore families for $1 and the enhanced value of the developed land of 200 acres.

The rights to the track through Kyle was then sold to the Texas Land Company, which would be in charge of plotting the town, who then sent a surveying party and filed plans with the county clerk for the town on September 7, 1880. The town originally consisted only of 6x3 city blocks for both commercial and residential zoning as well as a combination train depot and separate cotton platform along the tracks. The first lots were sold at an auction on September 25 under the now historically designated &#x27;Auction Oak&#x27; with the railroad offering free rides and food for attendees from Austin.

The new town drew residents and businesses from Mountain City as well as Blanco, four miles west, as well as independent farmers and ranchers in the county. Tom Martin operated the first business in Kyle as a saloon-meat market combo, the first of four saloons to open in the town&#x27;s inaugural year. Other founding families like the Nance and Wallace families would open a cotton gin and lumberyard not long after, and by 1883 the population exceeded 500, growing to over 700 by the first census the town participate in, but would later decline during the Great Depression and ensuing Dust Bowl. 

Kyle was incorporated in 1928 as a general-law city with a mayor and five council members. In 1937, Mary Kyle Hartson, daughter of Fergus Kyle, was elected mayor by a write-in vote. Hartson, after winning election again in 1944, would serve as mayor as part of an all-woman city council and making Kyle the only Texas town with an all-woman government.

From 1892 to 1901, Kyle was the childhood home of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Katherine Anne Porter. Many of her most famous short stories, such as &quot;Noon Wine&quot;, are set in locations in and around Kyle. Her former home is now a writer&#x27;s residence open to the public by appointment. The Katherine Anne Porter Literary Center hosts readings by visiting writers.

== Pie in the Sky Hot Air Balloon Festival ==
As part of a municipal branding scheme in the chase of becoming the &quot;Pie Capital of Texas,&quot; the Kyle Pie in the Sky Hot Air Balloon Festival has been an annual event in Kyle on Labor Day weekend since 2017. The event features morning hot air balloon &quot;mass ascensions” where balloons take off at sunrise flying over Kyle on Saturday and Sunday morning, as well as “glows” in the evenings, where tethered hot air balloons glow against the evening sky at Lake Kyle. 

Kyle achieved its goal on June 8, 2021, when Kyle was officially designated as the &quot;Pie Capital of Texas.&quot; However, The Kyle City Council voted to discontinue the annual Pie in the Sky festival in 2024 due to budget constraints and that the event is unreliable due to its weather dependency.

<text>Mountain City is a city in Hays County, Texas, United States. The population was 622 at the 2020 census.

==History==

From the early 1850s until the 1880s, Mountain City was a sprawling community on the old Stagecoach Road that served as an important hub in the ranching and farming industries of the newly formed Hays County. The original Mountain City was centered near the modern community of the same name, but stretched from the Blanco River around present-day Kyle all the way to Manchaca Springs northeast of present-day Buda.

The first settlers, such as Chattanooga native Phillip Allen and his family, landed in Mountain City around the time of the Texas Revolution in 1835 and 1836. Allen had acquired more than of land in what would become northern Hays County from Ben Milam&#x27;s colony grant from the Republic of Texas. But American Indians in the area fought to maintain control of their ancestral lands, driving the settlers away. Allen left to fight against Mexico for Texas independence.

In 1846, after the Texas Rangers had been enlisted to drive out the Indians, Allen and his family successfully settled their land. When Hays County was formed two years later, Allen became one of the first commissioners and was active in local politics until his death in 1860.

Another early family was the Buntons. Tennessee native John Wheeler Bunton moved to Texas in the early 1830s, signed the Texas Declaration of Independence, and served on the first Texas legislature. Just after the Texas Revolution, Bunton returned to Tennessee to marry his sweetheart, and brought back with him a company of 140 settlers for the new frontier. But while traveling by steamer from New Orleans to Texas, their ship was captured by a Mexican man of war and the party was imprisoned in Mexico city for three days.

According to historical lore, Bunton&#x27;s smooth-talking wife, Mary Howell Bunton, convinced their captors that they were American citizens legally entering Texas under the colonization law granted by Mexico to Stephen F. Austin. After their release, the Buntons continued on to Mountain City, where they built their &quot;Rancho Rambolette&quot; and began to farm and raise a family. Other early settlers included families such as the Vaughans, Bartons, Barbers, Porters, Moores, Rectors and Turners.

The Texas population began to grow rapidly in the 1850s, and Mountain City was no exception. By the 1850s, the small farming and ranching community was starting to thrive, with schools, churches, businesses, mills and gins. In 1855, the community built its first school, Live Oak Academy, with a professor Gibson as the first teacher, followed by John Edgar. The satellite communities of Elm Grove and Science Hall, near the sites of the recently constructed schools by the same names, also had schools and small commercial centers. 1855 also saw the formation of the first house of worship, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Baptist and Methodist churches followed in the 1870s. Along with the churches came the Chicago bar, located on the southern end of Mountain City, near the present day location of Wallace Middle School.

Col. W.W. Haupt, who came to Mountain City in 1857, opened a store around the location of the current Hays High School that became home to the Mountain City post office; he also served as postmaster. Two other prominent stores, run by Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Barber, were located about a mile north. The civil war era saw a population boom, and many young men of Mountain City served in the 32nd Cavalry regiment under Col. P.C. Woods and Capt. J.G. Story.

But much like the small towns of the 1940s that would wither when bypassed by the interstate, Mountain City&#x27;s fate depended on the railroad coming to town. For isolated communities at the mercy of the slow stagecoach line for communication with the world at large, the railroad was truly a life-changing development, bringing mail service, trade, and connections with the bustling cities of Austin and San Antonio. The fight for a depot was fierce, and the family of State Senator Fergus Kyle, living in the Blanco River area south of Mountain City, had the political connections to get the tracks laid through their neck of the woods, bypassing Mountain City to the east. The Kyle family deeded to the International-Great Northern Railroad, securing their place in history as founders of a town that would bear their name. From that moment on, Mountain City&#x27;s days were numbered.

As the fledgling railroad towns of Buda and Kyle sprang to life in the early 1880s, the residents of Mountain City began their exodus. Mountain City quickly dried up. Local schools hung on through the early 1930s, the only hint that the area had once been the regional center of commerce.

In 1990 Mountain City&#x27;s population was 377, and by the 2000 census, it had risen to 671. Now it&#x27;s in excess of 700, according to census estimates.

<text>Wimberley is a city in Hays County, Texas, United States. It is still predominantly a ranching area. The population was 2,839 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Wimberley started as a trading post settlement near Cypress Creek in 1848, the year Hays County was organized. After William Carvin Winters built a gristmill at the site in 1856, it took on the name &quot;Winters&#x27; Mill&quot;. When the mill was sold in 1864 to the Cude family, its name was changed to &quot;Cude&#x27;s Mill&quot;. It was sold again in 1874 to Pleasant Wimberley and took on his name. Over the years, the mill was expanded to process lumber, shingles, flour, molasses, and cotton.

The mill is gone, but Winter&#x27;s home survives and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1880, Alfred vom Stein, a postmaster from San Marcos, applied to have a post office established in the community, calling it &quot;Wimberleyville&quot;. The application was granted, but the name was shortened to Wimberley. Although the mill was shut down in 1925, the community was established and grew, becoming known as a resort town and popular with tourists. Prior to its incorporation in May 2000, it was a census-designated place (CDP).

==History==

Brownsboro was first settled in 1849 by John &quot;Red&quot; Brown, who operated a toll bridge across Kickapoo Creek on the road to Jordan&#x27;s Saline and Tyler. He had received a state issued license to operate a bridge near the town of Old Normandy. By 1860, Henry Cade had erected a sawmill and a cotton gin. With the construction of the St. Louis Southwestern Railway through the county in 1880, the town moved to the railroad.

The town of Old Normandy was near the site of present-day Brownsboro. It was established in 1845 by Johan Reinert Reiersen of Kristiansand, Norway, who urged Norwegian immigrants to settle in the new community. In the summer of 1847, a number of settlers died and many of the Norwegian immigrants moved to Four Mile Prairie in Van Zandt County and Prairieville in Kaufman County, also established by Reiersen.

A Norwegian Lutheran church and cemetery were established in Normandy in 1853, but after that the community merged into the Brownsboro settlement. A nearby Lutheran church served as the chapel for the cemetery until the 1920s.

<text>Coffee City is a small town in southeastern Henderson County, Texas, United States. The population was 249 at the 2020 census, down from 278 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The city was developed after the construction of Lake Palestine in the early 1960s. As it is located on a sliver of Henderson County, a wet county, which extends eastward onto Lake Palestine and Texas State Highway 155, a number of liquor stores sprang up by the 1980s to capture business from residents of Tyler and neighboring Smith County (which at the time was dry). The importance of Coffee City declined in 2012 with the passage of legislation which allowed beer and wine sales in Tyler.

==Geography==
Coffee City is located in southeastern Henderson County. It is on the western shore of Lake Palestine, a reservoir on the Neches River. The town limits extend into the center of the lake, which is the border with Smith and Cherokee counties. To the south, the town includes Ledbetter Bay and its two inlets: Ledbetter Inlet and Highsaw Cove, while to the north the town extends beyond the Caney Bay inlet.

Texas Highway 155 crosses Ledbetter Bay as it passes through Coffee City, then crosses Lake Palestine into Smith County. The highway leads northeast to Tyler and south to Frankston. Athens, the Henderson county seat, is west of Coffee City by highway.

As of the 2010 census, the town had a total area of , of which were land and , or 70.96%, were water.

The average household size was 2.30 and the average family size was 2.69.

==Government==
==Police==
The town maintains its own local police department, the Coffee City Police Department. In August of 2023, an investigation by Houston television station KHOU found it was a relatively large police force with 50 personnel, more than 20% of the town&#x27;s population, and more than five times the number employed by other municipalities of similar size. More than half of the department&#x27;s officers had reportedly been previously suspended, demoted, or terminated in prior law enforcement jobs. Additionally, John Jay Portillo, the chief of police, was discovered to have failed to disclose on his job application an unresolved DUI charge out of Florida. After becoming chief of police, Portillo also launched a questionable warrant division in which full-time officers were not required to work in the city. Several officers were also found to work private security jobs in the area (Texas law allows full-time police to hire themselves out for extra money). Portillo was suspended from his position on September 5, pending an investigation. On September 11, the city council unanimously voted to fire Portillo and to temporarily deactivate the department, pending the hire of a new chief, with the Henderson County Sheriff&#x27;s Office taking over in the interim, assisted by deputies from the nearby Smith County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. Questions regarding funding of the new police department have delayed action by the town council.

<text>Gun Barrel City is a town in Henderson County, Texas, United States. Its population was 6,190 at the 2020 census, an increase over the figure of 5,672 tabulated in 2010.

== History ==

The town began as an unincorporated community known as the &quot;Old Bethel Community&quot; in the 1960s after completion of Cedar Creek Reservoir. It was incorporated in the late 1960s so it could legally sell beer and wine. The town takes its name from a former road, Gun Barrel Lane (which is now State Highway 198), and has as its motto, &quot;We Shoot Straight with You&quot;, and its symbol—a rifle with two crossed antique pistols after having to remove Yosemite Sam as its unofficial mascot on its signs along the road at the town limits. Gun Barrel Lane is rumored to have gotten its name during the 1920s and 1930s when Jesse Daniels frequented the area. It was considered a safe backwoods place during Prohibition when the likes of Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker hung out in the area. The road got its name for simply being &quot;straight as a gun barrel&quot; for 2 mi between US Hwy 175 and Texas Hwy 334 to the south.

Gun Barrel City was formed in the 1960s. Not long after Cedar Creek Lake (a reservoir for the Tarrant Regional Water District) completed construction, the fledgling community that sat on its banks took steps to officially become a town.

Gun Barrel City was incorporated on May 26, 1969. Since then, it has grown into a main hub and access point for visitors to Cedar Creek Lake. In addition to the high level of tourism that the community experiences (particularly during the summer boating season), Gun Barrel City and the surrounding communities have experienced a residential building boom over the past several years. This growth has largely been led by the relocation of retirees from throughout the Dallas region, building lake homes to take advantage of Gun Barrel City&#x27;s lake access. 

In May 2000, Gun Barrel City voters elected their 13th mayor, 21-year-old entrepreneur and newspaper publisher Randal Tye Thomas. He resigned after community outcry in May 2001 following a grand jury indictment for one count of misdemeanor perjury and in the same week being arrested by the Gun Barrel City Police Department for public intoxication. All criminal charges were eventually dismissed. Thomas and the community were featured in many local, state, and national publications and programs, including a feature story in &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; and a feature interview on the nationwide NPR program &quot;This American Life&quot;. Thomas moved to the Dallas area in 2002, and died in 2014.

In 2008, Gun Barrel City received the coveted Certified Retirement Community recognition from the Texas Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Go Texan program. The community has also received recognition from the governor&#x27;s office, receiving second place on two separate occasions in the governor&#x27;s Community Achievement Awards.

<text>Moore Station is a city in Henderson County, Texas, United States. The population was 160 at the 2020 census. It was founded in 1876 by Anderson Moore, a former &quot;mulatto&quot; slave.

==History==

Anderson and Lucinda Moore, for whom the town is believed to have been named, were a pioneer family in the area; according to one source, they were former slaves. In 1876 they donated a plot of land for a Methodist church and for a school. The church and school made up the original Moore Station. Many freed slaves moved to the area from nearby Fincastle after slavery to purchase land and enjoy their newfound freedom. From the 1870 census the following were residents of the area:
*Ralph Calhoun, Martha Calhoun, with children Harriath Calhoun, William Calhoun, Mahalia Calhoun, Sallie Calhoun
*Anderson Moore, Lucinda Moore, with children Rovana and Susan Moore
*Hannah Moore, grandchildren George Peet, John Mills, Alzera Mills
*Flora Dickinson, with children Joshua and Sara Dickinson
*James and Ghana Brownfield, with children Lucinda, Mattie and Nettie
*Addison Cofer and Mary Jane Larkin, with children Addison Cofer Jr., Norton Cofer, and Omega Cofer

After emancipation freedman began to sharecrop with their former masters in communities like Fincastle, Pleasant Ridge and New York. Around 1872 they soon began to leave behind former plantations like Crossroads, Flat Creek, Stockard and such, and former masters such as Ratliff, Faulk, Wofford and Coleman. They began to purchase land in the Moore Station area, including the Andersons, Cofers, Douglases and Hightowers.

These slaves were brought into Texas from South Carolina, Alabama and Georgia by the pioneer families. These pioneer families were descendants of Huguenots who were escaping religious persecution in Europe. Some were descendants of the founding fathers, families like John O. Bullard, William Weatherford, Lachlan Durant, the Faulk brothers and others who migrated into the Deep South, which was Native American in the 1700s, to uproot tribes like the Creek and Seminole people.

In order to get a foothold into the deep South, some married into the tribes and began to raise families. They established outposts like Fort Mims and Little Tallassee in Alabama. This action later led to the infamous Trail of Tears. Most of the population of present-day Moore Station are descendants of their slaves such as Lousia Durant, Addison/Adderson Cofer and Ralph Calhoun.

<text>Donna is a city in Hidalgo County, Texas, United States. Donna is part of the McAllen–Edinburg–Mission and Reynosa–McAllen metropolitan areas. The population was 16,797 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Donna is in southeastern Hidalgo County, east of McAllen, in territory that was granted to Lino Cabazos as part of the La Blanca land grant on May 19, 1834, by the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. The Cabazos family inhabited the area for at least twenty years after taking possession of the land, and their descendants continued to live in the area into the twentieth century. The first known Anglo-American settler was John F. Webber, who, accompanied by his wife Sylvia (Hector), a former slave, settled in the area in 1839. The Webbers moved to the area in order to escape persecution for their interracial marriage.

Several families from northern states, including the Ruthven, Champion, and Hooks families, settled the area. Thomas Jefferson Hooks arrived in the Lower Rio Grande valley in 1900 and the following year moved his family to Run in southeastern Hidalgo County. In May 1902 he helped to form the La Blanca Agricultural Company, which purchased fronting the river east and west of the site of present Donna and extending north . He gave part of his purchase to his 21-year-old daughter, Donna Hooks Fletcher, a divorcée.

She settled in the area and established the Alameda (Grove) Ranch. Fletcher stocked the ranch with Jersey cattle purchased from the Lassater Ranch in Falfurrias and ran a successful butter business. The Hidalgo and San Miguel Extension (later called the Sam Fordyce Branch) of the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway reached the site in July 1904, when the town was founded. In 1907 the town received a depot and was named &quot;Donna&quot; in honor of Donna Fletcher (1879-1969), who was postmistress when the Donna post office opened in 1908.

That year the first store in west Donna was established by Ed Ruthven, and the community was recognized as the Texas station that shipped the most produce in a year. A 500-ton-capacity sugar mill was built in Donna that year. The &quot;Donna Developer&quot; was first printed on December 1, 1910, in Chapin. That year the Community Church was constructed and shared by the town&#x27;s Protestant groups. The First Presbyterian Church was founded on July 10, and the First Baptist Church was organized on July 24, 1910. The telephone exchange was installed in 1911. Donna incorporated on April 13, 1911. By 1912 the town was divided into Donna and East Donna. East Donna, the Mexican side of town, had a post office named &quot;Beatriz&quot;, after Beatriz Hooks, from 1912 to 1916. Saint Joseph Catholic Church and a school for Mexican children were located there.

A store was moved from Run to Donna in 1914 by Andrew Champion. In 1915 Donna had a population of 1,500, a bank, a hotel, four churches, two cotton gins, the sugar mill, and a weekly newspaper named the &quot;Donna Dispatch&quot;, published by B. L. Brooks. In 1916 the Donna Light and Power Company was incorporated by A. F. Hester Sr., T. J. Hooks, Dr. J. B. Roberts, and twenty stockholders. The American Legion Hall, Donna Border Post No. 107, was dedicated in 1920. Donna had an estimated population of 1,579 in 1925. By 1936 it had a population of 4,103, a railroad stop, multiple dwellings, and 110 businesses.

The citizens of Donna first started using the motto &quot;The City with a Heart in the Heart of the Rio Grande Valley&quot; to promote the city in the 1940s. By 1945 the town had a population of 4,712 and 78 businesses, and it continued to be a citrus and vegetable growing center. In 1953 Donna had three gins, three wholesale groceries, hardware and farm implements dealers, a wholesale distributor for feed mills, and the &quot;Donna News&quot;. The election of 1954 drew attention to Donna when Bob Jefferys, a newspaperman, requested that a special contingent of Texas Rangers be sent to the city by Governor Allan Shivers. He alleged that the election campaign was becoming violent because political bosses were physically threatening voters. The American Legion Hall was designated a historical landmark in 1964. In 1967 Donna reported 110 businesses (including eight manufacturers), ten churches, a bank, a library, and a newspaper.

From 1920 through the mid-1960s Donna had segregated schools. A third school for migrant students was in operation through the 1970s. The justification for its operation was that migrant children needed more attention because of their parents&#x27; work. It was opened to children in the third to eighth grade and had a separate campus. Donna had a population of 8,982 and 122 businesses in 1978. After the 1970s the economy in Donna continued to be based on fruits, vegetables, and the tourist trade. In 2000 Donna had a population of 14,768 and 369 businesses.

There are five colonias immediately south of the Donna city limits off Farm-to-Market Road 493. Colonia Nueva is on Farm-to-Market Road 493 south of Donna; Colonia Algeria is on River Road and Eleventh Street next to the city dump; Colonia Tierra Prieta is on the east side of Farm-to-Market Road 493; Colonia Salinas is south of Donna; and South Donna is a subdivision. Water is provided to the colonias by Colonia Nueva Water Distribution System, a privately owned enterprise that purchases water from the city of Donna and resells it to 400 colonia domiciles. Tierra Prieta also receives water from North Alamo Water Supply Corporation; it had an estimated population of 180 in 1986.

In 1998 Pablo Lucio Vasquez murdered David Cardenas.

<text>Edinburg ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Hidalgo County, Texas, United States. The population was 100,243 at the 2020 census, and in 2022, its estimated population was 104,294, making it the second-largest city in Hidalgo County, and the third-largest city in the larger Rio Grande Valley region.

Edinburg is part of the McAllen–Edinburg–Mission and Reynosa–McAllen metropolitan areas. Edinburg is home to the main campus of University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.

==History==
In 1908, John Closner, William Briggs, Argyle McAllen, Plutarco de la Viña, and Dennis B. Chapin began to develop a new community at this site. The town square was located at the current crossroads of U.S. Highway 281 and State Highway 107. The town was named &quot;Chapin&quot; in honor of one of the developers. A local myth relates that Edinburg became the county seat of Hidalgo County in a dramatic, nighttime covert operation in which the county records were removed from the previous county seat. However, historical records show more practical reasons. The 1886 Hidalgo County Courthouse in the city of Hidalgo was under frequent danger of flooding because it stood just a few yards away from the banks of the Rio Grande. Additionally, the county was over 80 miles long at this time, and state law required that the courthouse be close to the geographic center of a county. A wood-frame courthouse was designed and built beside the Chapin courthouse square in 1908; construction on a grand courthouse within the square began in 1910 under the supervision of San Antonio builders and a partnership of San Antonio architects. When Dennis Chapin was involved in the shooting death of Oscar J. Rountree at the Dan Breen Saloon in San Antonio, the community changed its name to &quot;Edinburg&quot; to honor John Young, a prominent businessman who was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. The town was officially renamed in 1911 and incorporated in 1919.

The Laguna Seca Ranch was initially established in the year 1867 by Macedonio Vela Senior and his wife Mercedes Chapa Cantu.

In 1867, he purchased one square league () of the Santa Anita Land Grant from John and Salome Balli McAllen.

In the decade spanning 1880 to 1890, he acquired more adjacent real estate holdings to yield a ranch over in extent; during this decade he grazed cattle, horses, and mules, and became an exporter of donkeys to Cuba. The first citrus trees in Hidalgo County were planted within the ranch property. Vela&#x27;s grandson, Reynaldo Vela, discovered an artesian well which supplies a lake of approximately in size, which lake was historically and inexplicably called &quot;Dry Lake&quot;. In the year 1975, a historical marker was placed at the ranch. In recent times family members manage the ranch holding, although it is subdivided into three tangent parcels.

In 1871, Vela&#x27;s daughter, Carlota, grew the first orange trees in Hidalgo County from the seeds of a fruit given her by a traveling priest. This is now an important citrus-producing area. The ranch had grown to when a school was built here in 1892. Delfina Post Office, named for another one of Vela&#x27;s daughters, was opened in 1893 and a Catholic church in 1894.

<text>McAllen is a city in the U.S. state of Texas and the most populous city in Hidalgo County. It is located at the southern tip of the state in the Rio Grande Valley, on the Mexico–United States border. The city limits extend south to the Rio Grande, across from the Mexican city of Reynosa. McAllen is about west of the Gulf of Mexico. As of the 2020 census, McAllen&#x27;s population was 142,210, making it the 23rd-most populous city in Texas. It is the fifth-most populous metropolitan area (McAllen–Edinburg–Mission) in the state of Texas, and the binational Reynosa–McAllen metropolitan area counts a population of more than 1.5 million.

From its settlement in 1904, the area around McAllen was largely rural and agricultural in character, but the latter half of the 20th century had steady growth, which has continued in the 21st century in the metropolitan area. The introduction of the &quot;maquiladora&quot; economy and the North American Free Trade Association led to an increase in cross-border trading with Mexico.

==History==

In 1904, the Hidalgo and San Miguel Extension (now the Sam Fordyce Branch) of the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway reached the Santa Anita Ranch. John McAllen and his son James had donated land to the railroad to guarantee it would cross this area. On December 5, 1904, the McAllen Townsite Company was formed by Uriah Lott, Leonidas C. Hill Sr., John McAllen (1826-1913), James Ballí McAllen (1862-1916), and John J. Young. The new community, which was named for John McAllen, had the depot nearest the county seat, Hidalgo, to the south.

By 1911, were under cultivation in East McAllen: commodity crops of cotton, alfalfa, broom corn, citrus fruits, grapes, and figs were raised. East McAllen had an estimated population of 1,000 that year, and West McAllen had ceased to exist. In 1911, the town applied for and was issued a charter of incorporation under the name McAllen. In 1916, 20,000 New York state troops were stationed at McAllen to help quell border disturbances related to the Mexican Civil War. The resulting economic boom increased the population from 1,200 in 1916 to 6,000 in 1920.

McAllen adopted a home rule charter in 1927. Canning factories, a winery, tortilla plants, wood-working plants, and some oil exploration increased the population to 9,074 by 1930. In 1936, Hiram Garner opened the Valley Distillery, Incorporated, which produced wines from citrus juices. The town was a petroleum and farm chemurgic center with a population of 11,877 in 1940, by which time it had adopted the nickname &quot;The City of Palms&quot;. In 1941, a suspension bridge replaced the old bridge from Hidalgo to Reynosa in Tamaulipas; the new toll bridge was purchased by McAllen and was named the McAllen–Hidalgo–Reynosa International Bridge. Its construction resulted in increased tourist trade, making McAllen a winter resort and port of entry to Mexico.

The discovery of oil in the Reynosa area in 1947 attracted a large migration of people from the Mexican interior to jobs in the region. They both constituted a new tourist market and a cheap labor supply for McAllen. The sister cities were linked as a result of the increased traffic between them. The population of McAllen was 20,005 in 1950 and 32,728 in 1960. In 1954 the McAllen–Hidalgo–Reynosa International Bridge was the number-two port of entry into Mexico.

McAllen was an agricultural, oil, and tourist center in 1970, when the population reached 37,636. By the start of the 1970s, McAllen had a 200-bed hospital and a new air-conditioned high school, the first school in the nation featuring on-site power generated by natural gas-powered turbines. The tourism industry continued to expand as people traveled to the area from both Mexico and the northern United States. The population continued to grow steadily through the 1970s, and reached 66,281 by 1980. During the late 1980s, the McAllen Foreign Trade Zone was an important general-purpose foreign trade zone. At the time, McAllen&#x27;s main industries were retail, tourism and farming, and each was in trouble. The devaluation of the Mexican peso in the 1980s put a damper on cross-border shopping; local tourism was down because of the recession. In 1983, a freeze took out much of the valley&#x27;s citrus crop.

In the mid-1980s, fueled by trade and the growth of the &quot;maquiladora&quot; (in which components are shipped to Mexico from the United States, assembled, and shipped back as finished products), the economy began to improve in Hidalgo County. McAllen sits across the border from Reynosa, a large manufacturing center. After the peso devalued, Mexico was more successful in attracting companies to run their plants in Mexico, with support operations in Texas.

Border crossing is a daily event for many and is a key component in the local economy. The city became a focal point for concerns about the border during the United States federal government shutdown of 2018–2019 over the Mexico–United States barrier. President Donald Trump held a briefing with the border agents at the patrol station here in January 2019. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen also visited the Border Patrol station in March 2019. In order to deal with overcrowded facilities in 2019 resulting from the arrival of Central American migrant caravans, immigration authorities were releasing a few hundred asylum seekers daily to private groups that assist them with basic needs and travel arrangements.

The mayor emphasized how safe and secure the city is when U.S military troops were mobilized in the city to help the Border Patrol. Portions of the razor wire coils considered unnecessary by the city were removed after troops had placed it at the border. The troops assisted by using military helicopters to carry border patrol agents to and from locations along the Mexico–United States border and by maintaining vehicles. During these border support activities, they are prohibited from law enforcement activities, such as detaining migrants or seizing drugs. U.S. military troops are prohibited from carrying out law enforcement duties. The Marine Corps Commandant General Robert Neller expressed concerns about the impact of continuing border support on combat readiness for the troops.

==Geography==
McAllen, located in southern Hidalgo County, is bordered to the southwest by Granjeno; to the west by Mission, Palmhurst, and Alton; to the north by Edinburg, the Hidalgo county seat; to the east by Pharr; and to the south by Hidalgo. The McAllen city limits extend to the southwest as far as the Rio Grande, directly north of Reynosa, Tamaulipas, in Mexico. The Anzalduas International Bridge crosses the Rio Grande at this point, southwest of downtown McAllen.

McAllen is south of San Antonio, southwest of Corpus Christi, southeast of Laredo, northwest of Brownsville, and northeast of Monterrey.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.62%, is covered by water.

Although McAllen is named the &quot;City of Palms&quot;, tropical vegetation is only locally dominant. Many thorny shrubs and deciduous trees occur in the area, such as the Rio Grande ash (&quot;Fraxinus berlandieriana&quot;), cedar elm (&quot;Ulmus crassifolia&quot;), and honey mesquite (&quot;Prosopis glandulosa&quot;).

===Climate===
McAllen, like much of South Texas, has a subtropical climate. Under the Köppen climate classification, the city features a subtropical semiarid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;), featuring long, very hot and humid summers, and brief, warm winters. The city has two distinct seasons, a wet season from May to October and a dry season from November to April. The normal monthly mean temperature ranges from in January to in August. The warm season is extremely long, as average high temperatures from May through September are above and average low temperatures are above , with relatively high dew point values, resulting in higher relative humidity and heat index values. Heat indices consistently reach over during these months. Winter temperatures in McAllen and surrounding Rio Grande Valley are some of the warmest in the contiguous United States outside of South Florida, and comparable to the Coachella and Imperial Valleys and Yuma Desert, but with warmer nighttime lows and higher dew points.

Average annual precipitation is . Most precipitation occurs in the warm season, with the least precipitation distinctly occurring in the cooler winter. As September is the peak of the north Atlantic hurricane season and tropical storms and hurricanes occasionally drop copious amounts of rainfall on the region, this month tends by far to be the wettest, averaging of rain. The driest month is February, with only of precipitation. Since 1941, it has snowed twice, once when the city received on December 25, 2004.

Temperatures consistently rise above from June through August, with exceptionally high humidity. The highest temperature ever recorded in McAllen was , set on June 22, 2017 and May 9, 2024. The lowest temperature ever recorded in McAllen was , on January 12, 1962.

While usually a hot, humid, but relatively dry climate, McAllen has received unusual weather phenomena. In 2013, McAllen received a large hailstorm that destroyed many vehicles and buildings. The storm came suddenly, and many people were unprepared. In December 2017, McAllen received almost of snow, nearly 13 years after the previous snowfall, which took place during the 2004 Christmas Eve United States winter storm. In February 2021, McAllen reached record low temperatures between and and lost power, heat, and water for a week due to Winter Storm Uri. In addition to these fluke weather events, McAllen is prone to tropical storms, hurricanes such as Hurricane Dolly (2008) and Hurricane Hanna (2020), and heatwaves.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===
As of the census of 2020, 142,210 people, 45,429 households, and 34,119 families were residing in the city.

===2010 census===
As of the census of 2010, 129,877 people, 41,573 households, and 31,823 families resided in the city. Of the 45,862 housing units, 4,289, or 9.4%, were vacant.

The racial makeup of the city was 83.9% White, 0.9% African American, 0.4% Native American, 2.6% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 10.4% some other race, and 1.8% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 84.6% of the population.

Of the 41,573 households, 46.0% had children under 18 living with them, 52.2% were married couples living together, 19.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 23.5% were not families. About 19.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 23.9% were someone living alone who was 65 or older. The average household size was 3.10, and the average family size was 3.58.

In the city, the age distribution was 30.1% under 18, 9.6% from 18 to 24, 28.1% from 25 to 44, 21.3% from 45 to 64, and 10.9% 65 or older. The median age was 32.2 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.2 males.

For the period 2012–2016, the estimated median annual income for a household in the city was $45,568, and for a family was $50,184. The per capita income for the city was $21,726.

===Crime===
Based on the Texas Department of Public Safety&#x27;s &quot;Annual Crime in Texas&quot; report and the FBI&#x27;s &quot;Crime in the United States&quot; report, five murders were reported during 2022. The city has been consistently ranked among the safest cities in Texas.

===Health===
McAllen was the focus of a 2009 article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; by Atul Gawande entitled &quot;The Cost Conundrum&quot;, an inquiry into the factors that contribute to the cost of health care. The McAllen area had the highest taxpayer-sponsored spending per beneficiary in the United States, despite areas with similar demographics and health profiles having half the cost per recipient. The article noted that while the area has a higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes, its rates of infant mortality, HIV, and tobacco use were lower than the national average.

McAllen was the most obese metropolitan area in the country in 2012, with 38.5% of the adult population considered obese. The high obesity rate has likely contributed to area residents&#x27; poor health. More than 21% of the population has been diagnosed with diabetes, more than any other metro area in the United States. Poverty may play a large role in the community&#x27;s health problems, as well. Over 25% of the city population was living below the poverty line during the period 2012–2016. More than 29% of the population also lacked health coverage during that time.

McAllen is featured in &quot;Supersize vs Superskinny&quot;, a British television programme on Channel 4 that features information about dieting and extreme eating lifestyles. One of the main show features is a weekly comparison between an overweight person and an underweight person. In the show, the overweight participant visits morbidly obese McAllen residents to find motivation for lifestyle and diet changes.

==Economy==
The Rio Grande Valley began its rapid development with the introduction of irrigation in 1898 and the construction of the railroad in 1904. These major additions turned a once relatively desolate area into a major agricultural center. Throughout much of the 1900s, McAllen was a rural, agriculture-based economy characterized by sporadic growth.

Today, the area is transforming into a major international trade area. As recently as 1990, McAllen&#x27;s unemployment rate was at 22.6%. By the end of 2005, that figure had dropped to 7.7%. However, in 2011, census.gov listed the McAllen metro area the poorest in the nation. As of 2012, the average cost of a home in McAllen was the third-least expensive in the country, at $178,000, while average monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment was $708. In 2012, the cost of living in McAllen was 16.2% lower than the national average.

===Trade===
Since the 1980s and especially since the ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, the focal point of economic activity has shifted from agriculture to international trade, health care, retail, and tourism.

The McAllen Foreign-Trade Zone (FTZ) is located south of McAllen between McAllen and Reynosa. Commissioned in 1973, it was the first inland foreign-trade zone in the United States. Also, an FTZ designation site is at the McAllen Miller International Airport to facilitate air cargo needs. Under U.S. and Mexican laws and NAFTA provisions, the FTZ designation offers specific cost-saving opportunities to manufacturers. Products can be brought into the FTZ duty-free. Services have recently expanded to include full logistic support services, including public warehouse services such as pick and pack, order processing, inventory control, incoming/outgoing quality inspection, and kitting.

==Sports==
McAllen hosted the NAIA National Football Championship in the late 1970s and NCAA Division II national football championship games in the 1980s.

Until 2014, McAllen was home to the Texas Thunder of the independent United League Baseball, who played at Edinburg Stadium.

==Recreation==

===Birdwatching===
McAllen is positioned on a major flyway, the migratory path of birds between North and South America, presenting opportunities for bird and butterfly expeditions. The landscape hosts a diverse wildlife population. The Quinta Mazatlan, a historic Spanish colonial mansion, is used as McAllen&#x27;s wing of the World Birding Center. The McAllen Nature Center is a popular spot for bird-watchers and nature enthusiasts alike. This preserved green space offers visitors a chance to explore walking trails, climb a small hill, and has a cactus garden - all without any charge for admission.

The Bicentennial Bike Path runs from Highway 83 on the south side to Bicentennial and Trenton Road on the north side. The International Museum of Art &amp; Science, Smithsonian affiliate and AAM-accredited museum founded in 1967, is located near the path at the corner of Bicentennial and Nolana Avenue.

The Zinnia Spray Water Park is McAllen&#x27;s first sprayground park. It is located at 29th and Zinnia Ave.

Champion Lakes Golf Course is located on South Ware Road just south of Highway 83. The golf course has 18 holes plus a driving range. This course hosts numerous tournaments year round.

<text>Mercedes is a U.S. city in Hidalgo County, Texas. The population was 15,570 at the 2010 census. It is part of the McAllen–Edinburg–Mission and Reynosa–McAllen metropolitan areas.

==Geography==

Mercedes is located in southeastern Hidalgo County at (26.149315, –97.918675). It is bordered to the west by Weslaco and to the east, in Cameron County, by La Feria.

The Interstate 2/U.S. Route 83 freeway passes through the northern side of Mercedes, leading west to McAllen and east to Harlingen. Mercedes is north of the Progreso–Nuevo Progreso International Bridge over the Rio Grande, connecting Texas with the Mexican state of Tamaulipas.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Mercedes has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.55%, are water.

==History==

Mercedes is known as &quot;The Queen City of the Valley&quot; or &quot;La Reina del Valle&quot;. Mercedes was founded September 15, 1907, by the American Rio Grande Land &amp; Irrigation Company, and was incorporated March 8, 1909. It is one of the oldest towns in the Rio Grande Valley, and the city celebrated its centennial in 2007.

The city was located in Capisallo Pasture, part of Capisallo Ranch owned by Jim Welles. This location was known as the Pear Orchard because of the vast numbers of prickly pear cactus growing there at that time.

The origin of the city name - Mercedes - is not clear. A common claim is that the first name given to the city was &quot;Diaz&quot; in honor of Porfirio Diaz, then president of Mexico. Later it was supposedly renamed &quot;Mercedes Diaz&quot; in honor of the president&#x27;s wife, and from that, Mercedes became the Queen City. This story, however, is historically inaccurate, given that neither of Diaz&#x27;s two wives were named Mercedes.

During President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s administration, Camp Llano Grande was founded in 1916 southwest of Mercedes. Today, its location is in Weslaco, Texas, a town that didn&#x27;t exist in 1916 and Mercedes was the nearest town. The National Defense Act called for the establishment of several National Guard camps, including Camp Llano Grande, to counter cross-border attacks led by Pancho Villa.
Soldiers from Indiana, Minnesota and North Dakota were stationed at the camp from 1916 - 1917. Upon the onset or World War I, the camp merged with Camp Mercedes to train soldiers for service in France.

General John J. Pershing chose Mercedes as the site for a permanent training camp when the United States entered WW1 in 1916. Construction of Camp Mercedes on a 80-acre tract southeast of town was completed in early 1917. Until the WWI recruits arrived, a 16th Cavalry training cadre occupied the camp. The soldiers who later arrived for WWI training specialized in the management of horses for service in France. At its peak, Camp Mercedes hosted 16 officers, 700 enlisted men and 600 horses. After the armistice, the camp was demobilized and closed in 1922.

The old Toluca Ranch still stands east of the International Bridge at Progreso, the sister city to the south. This ranch was close to the river and a prized target for the &quot;bandidos&quot; during the days of Pancho Villa. It was built with many secret rooms and passages, and had heavy wooden shutters on the windows to protect its residents.

Colegio Jacinto Treviño located in Mercedes, Texas, was a pioneering Chicano institution of higher education founded in 1970. It played a critical role in the Mexican-American civil rights movement, focusing on bilingual and bicultural education for underserved communities. Established in response to the limited access Mexican-Americans had to higher education and to challenge mainstream educational systems, the college became an emblem of Chicano self-determination and empowerment.
The college was founded during the height of the Chicano Movement, a period in which Mexican-Americans were organizing for civil rights, labor rights, and educational equity. Named after Jacinto Treviño, a Mexican-American revolutionary and educator, the institution was conceived as a space where Chicano students could receive an education relevant to their cultural identity, history, and the socioeconomic challenges faced by their communities. It was created by activists and educators who sought to decolonize education, asserting that traditional institutions failed to reflect the realities and needs of Mexican-American students.
