== History ==
===Early history===
Exeter Township was established in the late 18th century as one of the original townships of Luzerne County. It is believed to be named after Exeter, Rhode Island; the name Exeter derives from the town of Exeter in Devon, England. Exeter Township was later downsized when sections of the community were divided into several newer townships and boroughs (e.g., West Pittston Borough and Exeter Borough).

===Revolutionary War===
During the Revolutionary War, the Hardings—a group of settlers—were ambushed by a group of Iroquois and Loyalists on June 28, 1778. The field where these men were at work when they were killed is still part of Exeter Township. Five days later, on July 3, the Battle of Wyoming, also known as the Wyoming Massacre, occurred in what is now Exeter Borough and Wyoming Borough. Roughly 300 Patriot soldiers were killed. In the days following the battle, settlers fled the Wyoming Valley and spread the news of how the Patriots had been massacred.

In response, a scorched earth campaign was conducted by Continental Army forces under the command of Major General John Sullivan). The 1779 Sullivan Expedition destroyed numerous Iroquois villages in the Finger Lakes region of New York.

===After the war===
In the following decades (after the Revolutionary War), American settlers poured into Exeter. Farming and logging were the primary professions in the township. Sawmills and gristmills were constructed along creeks throughout the community.

<text>Fairmount Township is a township in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,207 at the 2020 census. Fairmount Township is home to Ricketts Glen State Park. The park receives tens of thousands of visitors each year.

==History==
===Early history===

Fairmount Township is in Pennsylvania, where humans have lived since at least 10000 BC. The first settlers in the state were Paleo-Indian nomadic hunters known from their stone tools. The hunter-gatherers of the Archaic period, which lasted locally from 7000 to 1000 BC, used a greater variety of more sophisticated stone artifacts. The Woodland period marked the gradual transition to semi-permanent villages and horticulture, between 1000 BC and 1500 AD. Archeological evidence found in the state from this time includes a range of pottery types and styles, burial mounds, pipes, bows and arrows, and ornaments.

Fairmount Township is in the Susquehanna River drainage basin, the earliest recorded inhabitants of which were the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannocks. They were a matriarchal society that lived in stockaded villages of large longhouses, but their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675 they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes.

After the demise of the Susquehannocks, the lands of the Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who also lived in longhouses, primarily in what is now the state of New York. The Iroquois had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers. To fill the void left by the demise of the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle in the Susquehanna watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).

The French and Indian War (1754–1763) and subsequent colonial expansion encouraged the migration of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin. On November 5, 1768, the British acquired land, known in Pennsylvania as the New Purchase, from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix; this included what is now Fairmount Township. After the American Revolutionary War, Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania. In 1890, a Native American pot, decorated in the style of &quot;the peoples of the Susquehanna region,&quot; was found under a rock ledge on Kitchen Creek by Murray Reynolds.

=== Township===
The first Europeans came to the region in the 18th century. The first settler in the township was John Franklin of Connecticut. Additional settlers followed in Franklin&#x27;s footsteps (e.g., Levi Seward and Nathaniel Goss). Under the Connecticut title—previous to 1776—it was originally known as Bloomingdale Township. The name was changed to Huntington Township in 1799 in honor of Samuel Huntington, a native of Connecticut and one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Fairmount Township broke away from Huntington Township in the 1830s; it was officially incorporated as a township in 1834.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.07%, is water. It is located in the northwestern corner of Luzerne County. The northern portion of Fairmount Township is mostly made up of mountains, lakes, streams, and thick forests. Ricketts Glen State Park is located in this half of the township. The southern half of Fairmount Township consists mostly of farmland and forests; the villages of Mossville and Rittenhouse are located in this part of the township. PA 118 and PA 487 intersect in the western part of the township in the village of Red Rock.

===Ricketts Glen State Park===
Much of Ricketts Glen State Park is in Fairmount Township. The park offers hiking, camping, horseback riding, and hunting. Lake Jean is used for swimming, fishing, canoeing, and kayaking. In winter there is cross-country skiing, ice fishing on the lake, and ice climbing on the frozen falls. Almost all of Kitchen Creek and the 24 named waterfalls are in the township.

<text>Fairview Township is a township in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 4,691 at the 2020 census.

==History==
===Founding===

In the late 18th century, Conrad Wickeiser was the first settler in modern-day Fairview Township. He was followed by James Wright, who built the first tavern and the first sawmill in 1820. Additional sawmills were constructed throughout the area. Logging was one of the chief industries in the area.
In September 1888, the court appointed several commissioners to examine and report whether or not dividing Wright Township would be feasible. The men reported in favor of division. The court approved the report; a referendum on the question of division was held in 1889. On May 6, the court—in accordance with the affirmative vote—ordered for the division of Wright Township; the new territory was named Fairview Township.

===Glen Summit Village===

One of the first settlers of Glen Summit Springs in Fairview Township was John Conety. In the early 20th century, Conety owned approximately that included present-day Indian Springs and Glen Summit Springs. Conety had a log cabin on the property and kept a roadhouse for passing travelers from the Wyoming Valley to New York City or Philadelphia.

After his death, the land passed to his son, Richard Conety, Senior. Conety sold the land and a house he had built on the property (in 1880) to H. H. Derr of Wilkes-Barre. Derr purchased the property for fish and game. A few years later, Derr sold the property to the Lehigh Valley Railroad.

In 1882, the Lehigh Valley Railroad (along with J.E. Patterson) organized the Glen Summit Hotel and Land Company. They purchased some adjoining land to their original purchase from Derr. The land was covered in scrub oak at the time, which allowed fantastic views of the valley that stretched before the westward face of Nescopeck Mountain. Over time this view was blocked by tree growth, but the addition of trees helped to increase the beauty of the neighborhood.

<text>Forty Fort is a borough in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 4,233 at the 2020 census. Its neighbors are Wyoming (to the north), Plains Township (to the east), Kingston (to the south), and Swoyersville (to the west). The Wilkes-Barre Wyoming Valley Airport and the Wyoming Seminary Lower School are both located in the borough.

==History==
===Revolutionary War===
In 1770, forty settlers from Westmoreland County, Connecticut, established a fort along the Susquehanna River in the area now known as Forty Fort Borough. Before the American Revolutionary War, both Connecticut and Pennsylvania claimed this territory, as Connecticut laid claim to a wide swath of land to its west based on its colonial charter. These competing claims triggered the Pennamite–Yankee Wars but were resolved after the Revolutionary War when the federal government awarded the contested territory to Pennsylvania.

During the Revolutionary War, a force of Loyalist soldiers and Haudenosaunee warriors arrived in the Wyoming Valley on June 30, 1778. On July 1, Fort Wintermoot and Fort Jenkins surrendered. Demands for Forty Fort to surrender were rebuked. On July 3, roughly 300 Patriot militia and 60 Continentals under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Zebulon Butler sallied from Forty Fort. In the ensuing Battle of Wyoming, commonly known as the Wyoming Massacre, about 300 Americans were killed.

The next morning, July 4, Lieutenant Colonel Nathan Denison agreed to surrender Forty Fort and two smaller forts, along with what remained of the militia. The Loyalist commander paroled them on their promise to take no part in further hostilities. None of the inhabitants were injured after the surrender, although some had their personal effects plundered. In 1900, a large stone was placed at the end of Fort Street, in Forty Fort Borough, by the Daughters of the American Revolution to mark the approximate location of Forty Fort.

===Post-Revolutionary War=== 
In the years following the Revolutionary War, Forty Fort became home to both the Nathan Denison House (built around 1790) and the Forty Fort Meetinghouse (built in 1806–08), which is located in the borough&#x27;s cemetery. Forty Fort was officially incorporated as a borough in 1887. The borough later became home to the Lower School of the Wyoming Seminary and a portion of the southern end of the Wilkes-Barre Wyoming Valley Airport.

===Flooding=== 
In June 1972, Hurricane Agnes caused the Susquehanna River to overflow its banks. In Forty Fort, a portion of the levee protecting the town broke. This caused millions of dollars in damage to Forty Fort and the surrounding communities. In addition to structural damage, the Forty Fort Cemetery was heavily affected when over 2,000 caskets were washed away. Recovered bodies were eventually buried in a mass grave with a monument marking the 1972 flood&#x27;s damage. In September 2011, the borough&#x27;s levee system was once again put to the test when Tropical Storm Lee caused severe flooding throughout the Wyoming Valley. However, this time the levee held, and the town was preserved from the catastrophe it witnessed in 1972.
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and of it, or 16.58%, is water. Forty Fort hugs the western bank of the Susquehanna River just north of Wilkes-Barre. Its neighbors are Wyoming (to the north), Plains Township (to the east), Kingston (to the south), and Swoyersville (to the west). Forty Fort is built on a floodplain and is protected by a levee system. In the 1972 flood, the levee broke and the neighboring Susquehanna River flooded much of the town. During the 2011 flood, the levee system was once again put to the test. However, this time it held, and the borough was preserved.

==Demographics==

==Government==
Forty Fort has a mayor/council form of government. The borough&#x27;s council consists of seven elected members. Elections are split every two years (where almost half the council is up for election). At first, the mayor and three council seats are up for election. Two years later, the other four council seats are up for election. This cycle repeats itself. The council acts as the legislative branch. Should the office of mayor or a seat on the borough council be vacant, the council will appoint a person to fill the vacancy.

The mayor is elected at-large to a four-year term. The mayor is primarily responsible for the public safety of the borough. One function of the office is to serve as spokesperson for the community and represent the borough at civic and social events. The mayor also reviews each ordinance enacted by the borough council; and can sign the ordinance, veto it, or permit it to become law without signature. The mayor also has the authority to break a tie vote on borough council. Other various functions of the office include performing wedding ceremonies and administering oaths.

Brian Thomas was appointed mayor by the borough council in January 2022, following the resignation of the previous mayor. He was elect to a shortened term in 2023.

==Education==
Forty Fort is part of the Wyoming Valley West School District. There are three schools located in Forty Fort:
*Dana Street Elementary Center, a public elementary school (part of Wyoming Valley West School District)
*Wyoming Seminary Lower School, a private school suited for pre-K to eighth grade
*Apple Tree Nursery and Primary School, a private school

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
U.S. Route 11 (Wyoming Avenue) runs from Wyoming, through Forty Fort, and into Kingston. PA 309 runs through the southern end of Forty Fort. The borough is also home to the southern edge of the Wilkes-Barre Wyoming Valley Airport, a public facility serving mainly general aviation aircraft. The rest of the airport is in Wyoming.

==In popular culture==
Following the lawsuits related to the 2020 United States presidential election, the town appeared in the season finale of the &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; where host John Oliver jokingly reinvented the story on the origin of the Forty Fort&#x27;s name.

<text>Foster Township is a township in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. The population was 3,413 at the 2020 census.

Foster Township police services are provided by White Haven Police Department. Emergency medical services are provided jointly by Freeland Northside Community Ambulance and White Haven Rescue Unit. Fearnots Volunteer Fire Company is Foster Township&#x27;s Fire Department.

==History==
===Founding===
Modern-day Foster Township was first settled in 1824 by John Lines. In 1855, territory was taken from Dennison Township to create a new municipality in Luzerne County; the new territory was incorporated as a township in 1855. It is named after Asa L. Foster. At the time, coal mining and logging were the two major industries in Foster Township.

===Eckley Miners’ Village===
====Early years====
Before the 1850s, Eckley was not a mining town, but a rural, forested community called Shingletown. It was located on land owned by Tench Coxe. The inhabitants took advantage of the surrounding woodlands and made shingles to be sold in White Haven and Hazleton. These goods were traded for the necessities of life, such as whiskey, port, and tobacco.

====Discovery of coal====
In 1853, four prospectors came to Shingletown and discovered that the land contained several veins of coal. Within the year, the Sharpe, Leisenring, and Company, later known as the Sharpe, Weiss, and Company, was formed. Judge Charles Coxe of Philadelphia, executor of the Tench Coxe Estate, granted the company a 20-year lease for the establishment and operation of a colliery on the 1,500 acres (6 km2) of land. In 1854, the company began to construct a colliery.

By autumn of 1854, the company had constructed a saw mill to provide lumber necessary for the colliery buildings, such as the breaker and stable. Shingletown was renamed Fillmore, presumably in honor of President Millard Fillmore who left office in 1853. The town was later renamed Eckley (in 1857) in honor of Judge Coxe&#x27;s eldest son, Eckley B. Coxe. In later years, Eckley Coxe, an engineer, became involved in the operations of the village.

====European immigration====
The first residents of Eckley were mostly English and Welsh immigrants who came from the mines in Great Britain. 
By the late 1850s and early 1860s, these miners were joined by groups of Irish farmers, who had immigrated to America after the devastating famine in their homeland. By the 1880s and 1890s, a new wave of immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe entered Eckley. These groups included people from Slovakia, Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, and Italy.

====Modern times====
&quot;The Molly Maguires&quot;—a 1970 movie—was filmed in Eckley in 1969. Eckley Miners&#x27; Village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

==Geography==

<doc id="133043" wikidata="Q1130934" url="?curid=133043" title="Freeland, Pennsylvania">
<text>Freeland is a borough in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. It was originally called Birbeckville, South Heberton, and Freehold. Freeland is south of Wilkes-Barre and northeast of Hazleton. It was incorporated as a borough on September 11, 1876. Coal mining was the chief industry in the community through the mid-20th century. As of the 2020 census, the population was 3,833.

==History==
===Establishment===
Joseph Birkbeck, the founder of Freeland, was born near Brough, in the county of Westmorland, England, on May 2, 1802. He and his wife Elizabeth came to America in 1844. After acquiring land from Edward Lynch the same year of his arrival, Birkbeck built a log cabin in a small valley between modern-day Freeland and Upper Lehigh. The next settler, Nathan Howey, purchased land from Birkbeck and built a frame house just west of Birkbeck&#x27;s log cabin.

===Coal mining===
Developing coal mines in the nearby region created a steep increase in population and a demand for building lots. This led Birkbeck to survey the region for the town of South Heberton. South Heberton has long since lost its identity and is now simply a cluster of houses along Schwabe Street, which is now part of Freeland.

Between 1845 and 1846, Birkbeck built a highway through South Heberton, Eckley Miners&#x27; Village, and Buck Mountain; it was known as Buck Mountain Road. Eckley was then known as Shingletown, as the chief industry there was the production of shingles.

The first child born at South Heberton was Elizabeth Birkbeck, the daughter of founder Joseph Birkbeck and his wife Elizabeth, in 1845. The first death at this place was that of William, the son of Joseph and Elizabeth Birkbeck, which occurred February 11, 1846. He was four years old at the time. The first store at South Heberton was owned by a man named Feist. It was located west of Birkbeck&#x27;s cabin. The first tavern was founded by Nathan Howey, the second settler in the region. Prior to the opening of Howey&#x27;s tavern, Birkbeck accommodated parties, who were prospecting for anthracite deposits, in his own home.

===Incorporation===
Freehold and South Heberton merged to create modern-day Freeland. Freeland was incorporated as a borough on September 11, 1876. Two years later, in 1878, a frame school was built in the town. By 1880, the population of the community surpassed 600. In 1883, the first Slovak Lutheran Church in America was organized in Freeland. The population steadily increased due to the expanding coal mining industry in the region. Many Europeans immigrated to Freeland up until the mid-20th century.

===Present day===
The coal mining industry in and around Freeland collapsed after the 1959 Knox Mine Disaster in northern Luzerne County. As of 2017, Freeland had a YMCA program, a community park, the Hazleton Area Public Library (Freeland Branch), and a remodeled Little League field. Also, there is a football/baseball field named &quot;Della Croce Field,&quot; after the former Director of the Freeland YMCA.

===Customs===
Since a large demographic of people in Freeland are of Irish descent, every year, there is a St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parade through downtown, which is followed by a dinner. There are also annual events for Memorial Day and Veterans Day, due to the large number of retired and active duty soldiers living in the surrounding communities. As part of the Memorial Day celebration, an annual Pub Run takes place, in which participants run a course with bars along the way. Participants must stop and finish a drink at each bar before continuing the race. The race usually consists of nine bars throughout the borough, as well as some that do not technically fall within the municipal entity.

==Geography==
Freeland is located south of Wilkes-Barre and northeast of Hazleton (in an agricultural region).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land. Foster Township completely encircles the borough. Pennsylvania Route 940 runs through Freeland; it provides a direct link to Hazleton and White Haven. The closest airport is Hazleton Regional Airport, which is a public airport two miles northwest of Hazleton City.

===Climate===
The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Dfb&quot; (Warm Summer Continental Climate).
&lt;/div style&gt;

==Government==
The borough government consists of a mayor and a seven-member borough council. The current mayor of Freeland is Joseph Palko Jr.

==Education==
Freeland is part of the Hazleton Area School District. Elementary and middle school students attend Freeland Elementary/Middle School. MMI Preparatory School, a college preparatory school for grades 6–12, is also located in Freeland.

<text>Glen Lyon is a census-designated place (CDP) in Newport Township, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,877 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The town of Glen Lyon was founded after anthracite coal mining began in Newport Township (ca. 1869). The colliery was operated by the Susquehanna Coal Company, a Pennsylvania Railroad property. The west side of the community was once called Morgantown; the east side was referred to as Williamstown. Later, the Glen Lyon Rail Station was established and the town was named after the terminus. Part of the east side, which was separated from the rest of the community by the railroad, became known as Canada. Roads and a streetcar line linked the town to Nanticoke and Wilkes-Barre. The streetcar line was replaced eventually by buses and automobiles as the main means of transport.

A hill divided the community into two parts. Sixth Shaft was established on the hill. Coal hoisted from that mine was moved across a bridge to the breaker (coal processing plant), which was built in 1887. Gravity moved the coal through a series of stages. The coal would then come out the north end of the breaker, where it was loaded onto railroad cars and trucks. The Seventh Shaft colliery operated west of Glen Lyon.

The town was originally developed by Welsh miners (who were Protestants); they were usually members of the Methodist church. There was a small Methodist church on Market Street. Later, immigrants from Central Europe (e.g., Poland) and Southern Europe became predominant. Two Polish Catholic parishes, Saint Adalbert&#x27;s and Saint Michael&#x27;s, were founded in the late nineteenth century. Their churches were built on the west side of the breaker. Other European miners and their families belonged to Ukrainian or &quot;Byzantine Rite&quot; parishes on the east side of town. A company-operated store existed for quite some time in Glen Lyon; it closed in the 1920s. Commercial structures were erected on Nanticoke Street, later Main Street, providing food and supplies to the community. Several neighborhood taverns existed throughout the town. Glen Lyon&#x27;s miners were involved in unionization activities, culminating in their representation by the United Mine Workers.

Mining declined after the Second World War. The M. A. Hanna Company closed Seventh Shaft but retained Sixth Shaft and its breaker well into the 1960s. The breaker closed in 1971; it later burned overnight in October 1974. The death of deep mining in Northeastern Pennsylvania after the 1959 Knox Mine Disaster also diminished the town. However, some strip mining did continue in the following years. Small dress factories provided employment, mostly for women, in the period when mining was in decline; but they too closed. Retirees formed a large portion of the population. Many businesses closed as deep mining declined, and increasing numbers of houses stood vacant. The Roman Catholic churches were gradually consolidated, and St. Michael&#x27;s was demolished (ca. 2004). St. Dennis, the &quot;Irish&quot; church, became a possession of the Knights of Columbus.

Glen Lyon was fictionalized as &quot;Coaltown&quot; for the 1948 film &quot;The Miracle of the Bells&quot;, and some exterior scenes were shot there.

<text>Hanover Township is a township in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. As of the 2020 census, the population was 11,424, making it the most populous township in the county.

==History==

Hanover Township was one of the original townships laid out by the Susquehanna Company of Connecticut. Captain Lazarus Stewart and dozens of his followers moved from Lancaster County into the Wyoming Valley in 1770; they fought for Connecticut in the Yankee-Pennamite Wars. For their service to Connecticut, Captain Stewart and his followers were granted a tract of land which became Hanover Township. The community was named after Lazarus Stewart&#x27;s hometown of Hanover in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. In the early 1770s, Captain Lazarus Stewart built the first house in the Breslau section of the township (between Solomon Creek and the Susquehanna River).

Native American raids were very common in the Wyoming Valley in the 18th century. On July 3, 1778, Loyalist and Iroquois forces routed the Patriot militia at the Battle of Wyoming in present-day Exeter. Over two dozen Hanover Township residents were killed in the fight.

The original township occupied all the land from Wilkes-Barre to Newport Township, and all the land between the Susquehanna River and the Lehigh River. In the 19th century, the original township downsized when sections of it broke away to form new municipalities, including townships, boroughs, and cities. 

In the following decades, coal mining became the major industry in and around Hanover Township. Coal breakers were constructed throughout the region. One, in particular, was built in modern-day Ashley; it was known as the Huber Breaker. 

Following the collapse of the mining industry in Wyoming Valley, the breaker was demolished in 2014. Ashley Planes, a historic freight cable railroad in Hanover and Fairview Townships, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

==Geography==
 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.82%, is water. The Susquehanna River drains the municipality and separates it from Larksville Borough, Plymouth Borough, and Plymouth Township. The north side of the township — near the river — is mainly low-lying ( above sea level); most of the township&#x27;s homes and businesses reside in the northern and central portions of the township. The southern portion of the municipality is mountainous, rising to at the summit of Haystack Mountain on the southeast border. The township lies directly between the cities of Wilkes-Barre and Nanticoke.

The main thoroughfares in Hanover Township are the South Cross Valley Expressway (PA 29), the four-lane Sans Souci Parkway (locally pronounced &quot;San Suey&quot;), and the two-lane South Main Street. The former connects I-81 in the southeast with U.S. 11 in West Nanticoke which connects Wilkes-Barre and Nanticoke. 

I-81 and PA 309 provide access to Hazleton, Wilkes-Barre Township, and Scranton. In the northern portion of the community, the Carey Ave Bridge, also known as the 1st Battalion, 109th Field Artillery Pennsylvania Army National Guard Bridge. crosses the Susquehanna River, linking Hanover Township to Plymouth and Larksville. 

Hanover&#x27;s 12 villages are Askam, Breslau, Buttonwood, Dundee, Hanover Green, Iona, Korn Krest, Lee Park, Lower Askam, Lyndwood, Newtown, and Preston. The township is part of Hanover Area School District, which is located in central Luzerne County.

Harveys Lake was not officially incorporated as a borough until 1968. Prior to that, the area was an unincorporated part of Lake Township.

According to The Jesuit Relations, prior to European colonization, the region was inhabited by the Scahentoarrhonon people, an Iroquoian-speaking group.

Historically, the first White resident in the vicinity of the lake was Matthew Scouten, who arrived in the early 1790s, but the first White settlers were the Worthingtons, who arrived in 1806.

Harveys Lake became a major resort destination in the early 20th century, attracting tourists from all over the Northeast. Hotels, cottages, boathouses, a casino, and even an amusement park were constructed around the lake. The grand Hotel Oneonta was especially prominent in the early 1900s; former United States President Theodore Roosevelt was a guest in August 1912.

From 1952 to 1956, Pennsylvania State Senator T. Newell Wood hosted the Brynfan Tyddyn Road Race around his estate in Harveys Lake. Brynfan Tyddyn is Welsh for &quot;large farm on a hilltop&quot; and the race consisted of 10 laps around a 3.5 mile course around the estate. The race was discontinued in 1957 after a fatal accident and officials determined the course was too dangerous and difficult for participants and spectators to reach.

<text>Hazle Township is a township in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 10,150 at the time of the 2020 census. The township surrounds the city of Hazleton and the borough of West Hazleton.

==History==
===Establishment===
Delaware and Seneca tribes traveled through what is now southern Luzerne County to trade with other Native American settlements in New York and the Chesapeake Bay area. The most common route for the Native Americans was known as &quot;Warriors Path&quot;, which was also used by white settlers in the 18th century. Broad Street (PA 93) is roughly the location of the trail.

Moravian missionaries were among the first Europeans to travel to the region; they wanted to convert Native Americans to Christianity. The Hazleton area was then a shallow valley with an abundance of hazel trees. It is speculated that the Native Americans were the first to refer to the area as &quot;Hazle Swamp.&quot;

===Coal mining===

At the beginning of the 19th century, Native Americans abandoned their territory in the east while European settlers continued to move into the region. 

In 1804, a private company widened &quot;Warriors Path&quot;, which was renamed the Berwick Turnpike. As a result, logging became the major industry in the area. Logging remained the largest industry in southern Luzerne County until the 1830s, when anthracite coal was discovered under the land that had been cleared. In 1836, the first mines and settlements were established in present-day Hazle Township.

Hazle Township was formed from a section of Sugarloaf Township in 1839; in 1856, a portion of Butler Township was added to Hazle Township. By the mid-19th century, the territory had changed dramatically from its early days. The expanding coal industry led to more extensive roads, railroads, and housing settlements. Immigrants, mostly from Europe, came to Greater Hazleton by the thousands to work in the dangerous mines. For the next century, large amounts of coal from Hazle Township were shipped by train to the lucrative Philadelphia market.

====Lattimer Massacre====
On September 10, 1897, about 300 to 400 unarmed strikers, nearly all of Slovaks and Germans, marched to a coal mine owned by Calvin Pardee (in the town of Lattimer in Hazle Township) to support a newly formed UMW union. The demonstrators were confronted by law enforcement officials several times on the road; they were ordered to disperse, but kept marching.

The deputies had spent most of the morning joking about how many miners they would kill. While on a streetcar headed for Lattimer (with the sheriff and his comrades), one deputy was overheard saying &quot;I bet I drop six of them when I get over there.&quot;

When the demonstrators reached Lattimer at 3:45 pm, they were met again by the sheriff and 150 armed deputies. Sources differ on the number of deputies present. One source claims only 86 deputies confronted the marchers. Sheriff Martin ordered the marchers to disperse, and then attempted to grab an American flag out of the hands of the lead marcher. A scuffle ensued, and the police opened fire on the unarmed crowd. Nineteen miners died, and anywhere from 17 to 49 others wounded. All had been shot in the back, and several had multiple gunshot wounds which indicated that they had been targeted by the deputies.

===20th century===

The population of Hazle Township peaked at nearly 15,000 residents in the early 20th century. By the 1940s, the population began to dwindle; this was the result of the declining coal industry. Many mines closed in the 1940s and 1950s. Many residents were forced to seek jobs elsewhere.

Although the region was in the midst of an economic recession, local leaders were determined to turn the economy around. CAN-DO (Community Area New Development Organization) was formally organized in 1956 by founder Dr. Edgar L. Dessen. It was founded to bring new industry into the area. Their first priority was to raise money—through their &quot;Dime a Week&quot; campaign—in which area residents were encouraged to put a dime on their sidewalk each week to be collected by CAN-DO.

The company raised over $250,000 and was able to purchase over 500 acres (2.0 km2) of land, which was converted into an industrial park. CAN-DO was responsible for establishing the Valmont, Humboldt, and McAdoo industrial parks. CAN-DO also founded a white-collar business park in the late 1990s; it was named the CAN-DO Corporate Center, located in nearby Drums. Today, retail development and housing construction are on the rise in Hazle Township.

<text>Hazleton is a city in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 29,963 at the 2020 census. Hazleton is the second-most populous city in Luzerne County. It was incorporated as a borough on January 5, 1857, and as a city on December 4, 1891.

Hazleton is located in Northeastern Pennsylvania, northwest of Allentown, north-northwest of Philadelphia and west of New York City.

==History==

During the early years of European colonization in the Americas, the area which today makes up the city of Hazleton sat at the intersection of two Native American trails.

The Nanticoke path was used by the Nanticoke people during their migration to and settlement of the Wyoming Valley, east of Wilkes-Barre.

The Nescopeck path ran from the forks of the Delaware River, to the Nescopeck Creek. It was used by traders and missionaries, Delaware war parties, and settlers.

===Sugarloaf massacre===

During the height of the American Revolution, in the summer of 1780, British sympathizers (known as Tories) began attacking the outposts of American revolutionaries located along the Susquehanna River in the Wyoming Valley. Because of reports of Tory activity in the region, Captain Daniel Klader and a platoon of 41 men from Northampton County were sent to investigate. They traveled north from the Lehigh Valley along a path known as &quot;Warrior&#x27;s Trail&quot; (which is present-day Pennsylvania Route 93). This route connects the Lehigh River in Jim Thorpe (formerly known as Mauch Chunk) to the Susquehanna River in Berwick.

Captain Klader&#x27;s men made it as far north as present-day Conyngham, when they were ambushed by Tory militiamen and members of the Seneca tribe. In all, 15 men were killed on September 11, 1780, in what is now known as the Sugarloaf massacre.

The Moravians, a Christian denomination, had been using &quot;Warrior&#x27;s Trail&quot; since the early 18th century after the Moravian missionary Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf first used it to reach the Wyoming Valley. This particular stretch of &quot;Warrior&#x27;s Trail&quot; had an abundance of hazel trees. Though the Moravians called the region &quot;St. Anthony&#x27;s Wilderness&quot;, it eventually became known as &quot;Hazel Swamp&quot;, a name which had been used previously by the Native Americans. The Moravian missionaries were sent from their settlements in Bethlehem to the site of the Sugarloaf Massacre to bury the dead soldiers. Some Moravians decided to stay, and in 1782, they built a settlement (St. Johns) along the Nescopeck Creek, which is near the present-day intersection of Interstates 80 and 81.

===Jacob Drumheller===
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the Warrior&#x27;s Trail was revamped and widened. It was renamed the Berwick Turnpike. Later, a road was built to connect Wilkes-Barre to McKeansburg. This road intersected with the Berwick Turnpike. An entrepreneur named Jacob Drumheller decided that this intersection was the perfect location for a rest stop, so in 1809, he built the first building in what would later be known as Hazleton. Though a few buildings and houses were erected nearby, the area remained a dense wilderness for nearly 20 years. At the time, the area offered little more than small-scale logging. Jacob Drumheller is buried at Conyngham Union Cemetery.

===Discovery of coal===

In 1818, anthracite coal deposits were discovered in nearby Beaver Meadows by prospectors Nathaniel Beach and Tench Coxe. This caught the attention of railroad developers in Philadelphia. A young engineer from New York named Ariovistus &quot;Ario&quot; Pardee was hired to survey the topography of Beaver Meadows and report the practicality of extending a railroad from the Lehigh Canal in Jim Thorpe to Beaver Meadows. Knowing that the area of Beaver Meadows was already controlled by Coxe and Beach, Pardee bought many acres of the land in present-day Hazleton. The investment proved to be lucrative. The land contained part of a massive anthracite coal field. Pardee is known as the founding father of Hazleton because of these contributions and initially laying out the patch town that eventually became Hazleton.

Pardee incorporated the Hazleton Coal Company in 1836, the same year the rail link to the Lehigh Valley market was on the brink of being completed. Hazleton Coal Company built the first school on Church Street, where Hazleton City Hall is now located. Pardee also built the first church in Hazleton, located at the intersection of Church and Broad Streets, and the first private school in Hazleton, located on the south side of Broad Street between Wyoming and Laurel Streets. Pardee died in 1892. The following year, in 1893, his son, Israel Platt Pardee, built a three-story, 19-room mansion in Hazleton; it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

The anthracite coal industry attracted many immigrants for labor. The first wave, in the 1840s and 1850s, consisted mostly of German and Irish immigrants. The second wave, from the 1860s to the 1920s, consisted mostly of Italian, Polish, Russian, Lithuanian, Slovak, and Montenegrin immigrants. The coal mined in Hazleton helped establish the United States as a world industrial power, including fueling the massive blast furnaces at Bethlehem Steel.

=== Incorporation ===
Hazleton was incorporated as a borough on January 5, 1857. Hazelton was intended to be the borough&#x27;s name, but a clerk misspelled it during its incorporation, and the name &quot;Hazleton&quot; has been used ever since. The borough&#x27;s first fire company, the Pioneer Fire Company, was organized in 1867 by soldiers returning home from the American Civil War.

Many small company towns, often referred to by locals as &quot;patch towns&quot; or &quot;patches&quot;, surrounded Hazleton. They were built by coal companies to provide housing for the miners and their families. The following is a list of &quot;patch towns&quot; constructed in and around Hazleton:
* Beaver Meadows, coal was discovered here
* Stockton, founded by John Stockton
* Jeansville, founded by James Milens
* Milnesville, founded by James Milens
* Tresckow, formerly known as Dutchtown
* Junedale, formerly known as Colraine
* Freeland, originally called Freehold (founded by Joseph Birkbeck in 1846)
* McAdoo, originally called Pleasant Hill, then Saylors Hill
* West Hazleton, founded by Conrad Horn
* Eckley, founded by Eckley B. Coxe
* Jeddo, named after a Japanese port to which coal was exported by the Hazleton Coal Company
* Hollywood, part of Hazleton, named before Hollywood, California
* Weatherly, a small borough outside of Hazleton
* Humboldt Village, a tiny village outside of Hazleton

===Prosperity and tragedy===

As industry and commerce developed, so did the footprint of organized labor. Nineteenth century attempts by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) to organize in the anthracite region were largely unsuccessful.

On September 10, 1897, after several weeks of escalating walkouts and strikes at surrounding mines, the Lattimer Massacre occurred when 300-400 strikers near Hazleton marched to the Lattimer Mine to support a newly formed UMW local. Nineteen unarmed striking miners, mostly of Polish, Slovak, Lithuanian, and German ethnicity, were shot and killed in a confrontation with the Luzerne County sheriff&#x27;s posse. Scores more were wounded. The massacre was a turning point in the history of the UMW, with over 10,000 new members signing cards in its aftermath. However, the UMW would not be able to capitalize on this momentum and obtain union recognition in the Leigh Valley until the 20th century.

Hazleton was also struck by several mining disasters. Notable among these were the cave-ins at Sheppton, Jeanesville, and Stockton.

Mining disasters were not the only tragedies. In October 1888, a train crash killed 66 people near Mud Run when one passenger train crashed into the rear of another train on their way to White Haven. It was one of the worst train wrecks recorded in United States history.

In 1891, Hazleton became the third city in the United States to establish a citywide electric grid. Hazleton was incorporated as a city on December 4, 1891. At the time, the population was estimated to be around 14,000 people.

In the second half of the 19th century, middle class professionals whose industries serviced the mining economy led an effort to diversify the economy in Hazleton and attract large scale manufacturing employers, who could hire from the area&#x27;s large pool of unemployed women. The local improvement associations who led this initiative were successful in attracting a number of firms, including several mills and a brewery. The Duplan Silk Corporation opened in Hazleton in 1899, with financial support from local banks, the Lehigh Valley Railroad, and $10,000 from a fundraising drive.

===20th and 21st centuries===


Leading into the 20th century, Hazleton&#x27;s population drastically changed. The &quot;boom period&quot; in population was 1885 to 1920. In 1860, there were only about one thousand people in Hazleton, but by 1880, there were nearly seven thousand people, which quickly became thirty-two thousand by 1920. After the 1900 and 1902 anthracite coal strikes, mine workers won some improvements to their working conditions, which they were able to build upon in ensuing contracts. The diversification of the city&#x27;s economy stabilized the population by allowing miners to establish families in the area, with women and children often working in silk or shirt manufacturing for supplemental wages.

The Duplan Silk Mill was expanded in 1908 and became one of the largest and most productive silk mills in the country, employing between 1,800 and 2,000 area residents and with an annual payroll of $5 million. The mill produced about 25 million yards of cloth per year. In 1913, 1,200 silk workers, mostly young women, went on strike at the Duplan silk mill and voted to join the Industrial Workers of the World. The strike was overshadowed by the contemporaneous Patterson Silk Strike, and failed to achieve momentum.

The first Hazleton Public Library opened in 1907. In 1912, a new library opened on Church and Green streets. This building was donated by independent coal operator John Markle and is still in use today as the Hazleton Area Public Library&#x27;s children&#x27;s department.

Coal production began to decline in the late 1920s, but the mining industry still employed nearly 20,000 men at that time. In 1926, 900 miners at the Jeddo-Highland Coal Company initiated a wildcat strike over a pay dispute. They were ordered back to work by the District 7 president of the UMWA, who insisted that they negotiate the dispute through the Anthracite Board of Conciliation as outlined in their contract.

The population peaked in 1940 at 38,000. With increased population came increased business, from downtown storefronts to large campuses like Penn State Hazleton.

In 1941, UMWA President John L. Lewis revoked the charter of the UMWA&#x27;s District 7 local in response to a 27-day work stoppage by 20,000 miners in protest of dues increases and other union policies. The local was administered by a provisional government for some time and had its constitution suspended.

One of the 14 games between I.A. Horowitz and Samuel Reshevsky during the 1941 US Chess Championship was held in Hazleton. The result was a draw. The remaining games were held in Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Lakewood, New Jersey and Binghamton, New York.

In 1946, local milk producers initiated a capital strike, closing facilities and halting the delivery of milk to 100,000 residents in the region in protest of Office of Price Administration policy.

Before World War II, anthracite coal flourished as a major provider of fuel for the nation. After the war, the demand for coal began to decline as natural gas and electricity became preferred power sources; coal became a less needed commodity. Deep mining, the predominant method of coal extraction in the region, also proved costly and vulnerable to flooding. In 1947, 22 consecutive days of rain flooded many Hazleton area mines and reduced year-to-date anthracite production by up to 35% below normal levels.

Hurricanes Hazel and Diane, in 1954 and 1955, also devastated the local mining industry. They flooded the mines and brought an end to Hazleton&#x27;s deep mining. Unemployment soared, reaching 25-30%. The population began to emigrate at a rate of 1,000 per year. While most of the region&#x27;s deep mines never reopened, strip mining would continue as long as it was economically advantageous. A new era was about to be born: the era of business and industry.

The garment industry thrived and was invested in by New York mobster Albert Anastasia.

In 1947, Autolite Corporation was looking to expand operations in the East and had been looking into Hazleton. Officials from Autolite came to the area and surveyed the land. In their report, they noted that Hazleton was a &quot;mountain wilderness&quot; with no major water route, rail route, trucking route, or airport.

Local leaders sought to address these deficiencies by soliciting donations from the public to subsidize the establishment of the $3,500,000 Autolite plant. They promised the Autolite Corporation $500,000 and were able to raise $659,000. The initiative was supported by local businessmen, service clubs, and the UMWA. The Hazleton Industrial Development Corporation also took out loans totaling $700,000 to fund the construction of the plant.

In 1959, a fire at the Gary Hotel killed six people. The hotel, built in 1884, burned down costing around $200,000 in damages.

Public investment in attracting businesses and diversifying the economy continued throughout the 20th century. CAN DO (Community Area New Development Organization) was formally organized in 1956 by founder Dr. Edgar L. Dessen. CAN DO raised money through their &quot;Dime A Week&quot; campaign, in which area residents were encouraged to put a dime on their sidewalk each week to be collected by CAN DO. They also solicited donations from businesses and utilities and sold municipal bonds. The company raised over $250,000 and was able to purchase over of land, which was converted into an industrial park on the western edge of the city.

Because of CAN-DO&#x27;s efforts, Hazleton was given the All-America City Award in 1964. Hazleton&#x27;s economy is now based largely on manufacturing and shipping, facilitated by the relative closeness to Interstates 80 and 81. Five Pennsylvania highways also pass through the Hazleton area: Pennsylvania Route 309, Pennsylvania Route 93, Pennsylvania Route 924, Pennsylvania Route 424, and Pennsylvania Route 940.

The Hazleton Area Public Library opened a new building at Church and Maple Streets in 1969, where it remains to this day.

In 1997, the IWW returned to the Hazleton area in an effort to organize student workers at the Keystone Job Corps Center, but they found little success.

An article published in December 2002 by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, &quot;Letter from Pennsylvania: A town in need of a tomorrow&quot;, reported on Hazleton&#x27;s shortcomings. It was criticized by local politicians and business leaders.

On September 11, 2004, the Hazleton campaign hall of the Socialist Workers Party was firebombed, damaging the front of the building and burning campaign literature. The building&#x27;s books were destroyed by smoke damage. A rally held in response to the attack was attended by the Pennsylvania Governor&#x27;s Advisory Commission on Latino Affairs as well as local religious leaders and the Spanish-language media. An executive from the IBEW local 1319 in Wilkes-Barre visited the hall and made a contribution to the rebuilding effort.

===Second immigration wave===

The city experienced a demographic shift in the first years of the 21st century with the arrival of new immigrants: mostly from the Dominican Republic.

The demographic shift was not well received by all residents. In 2004, a wave of attacks against apartments where immigrant workers were living was condemned by the Pennsylvania Governor&#x27;s Advisory Commission on Latino Affairs.

In 2006, Hazleton gained national attention as Republican Mayor Lou Barletta and council members passed the Illegal Immigration Relief Act. This ordinance was instituted to discourage hiring or renting to illegal immigrants. Initially, the ordinance levied an administrative fine of $100.00 per illegal immigrant rented to and a loss of permits for non-compliance. Another act passed concurrently made English the official language of Hazleton.

Mayor Barletta estimated that &quot;as many as half&quot; of the estimated 10,000 Hispanics who were living in Hazleton left the city when the ordinance was passed. The issue was covered by the television program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in 2006 and the Fox News show &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; in March 2007.

The ordinance was criticized as illegal and unconstitutional. A number of residents (landlords, business owners, lawful aliens defined as illegal under the act, and unlawful aliens) filed suit to strike down the law, claiming it violates the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution as well as the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. After a trial and several appeals (including a remand from the Supreme Court), the Third Circuit found the ordinance invalid due to federal preemption.

As of 2015, nearly 40 percent of Hazleton&#x27;s population was of Hispanic or Latino descent. In 2012, Amilcar Arroyo, a Hazleton Integration Project board member, estimated that 80% of Hazleton&#x27;s Hispanics and Latinos were of Dominican origin, and that many of them had ancestry from San José de Ocoa. Hazleton has the highest percentage of Dominicans in Pennsylvania and the fourth highest in the nation. Many Dominicans had moved to Hazleton from portions of New York City, including The Bronx and Brooklyn) and parts of North Jersey, such as Newark and Paterson. Many of these migrants had families that were relatively large.

Many Hispanic and Latino businesses are on Wyoming Street, the linguistic landscape of which Spier and Ruano (2021) investigated in light of Barletta&#x27;s aforementioned comments. In 2016, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; reported that the Wyoming Street corridor was revived from a moribund state. Also, in 2016, the Hispanic and Latino population became the majority, at 52%, with White residents, many descended from Irish, Italian, and German immigrants, comprising 44% of the population.

<text>Hunlock Township is a township in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,215 at the 2020 census.

==History==
It is believed that the first white settler was named “Boggs,” who constructed a log cabin in modern-day Hunlock Township. “Boggs” joined the Patriots during the Revolutionary War. It&#x27;s speculated that while he was away from home, his family was either driven away or massacred by the Native Americans living within the region.

In 1778, Edward Blanchard and Jonathan Hunlock settled near the mouth of Hunlock Creek. They did not have their families with them; in 1790, they returned to their old homes. Future settlers to modern-day Hunlock Township were lumberjacks, who built saw mills in the territory. Additional settlers built gristmills and a smelting furnace.

Hunlock Township, which was named after Jonathan Hunlock, was organized on January 8, 1877; the territory was carved out of Union and Plymouth Townships. When the township was formed, it had a population of 759.

<text>Huntington Township is an American township which is in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. The population was 2,052 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==

Huntington Township is located in western Luzerne County. This area is also known as the Wyoming Valley. In 1762, the Susquehanna Company attempted to settle the land. Company executives, who employed rough six hundred people from Windham County, Connecticut during this time, sent a number of their personnel to the modern-day counties of Luzerne, Lackawanna, Wyoming, Bradford, and Susquehanna to resettle there. Conflict with Native Americans in the region ensued, causing delays in those plans, which were also delayed further by the Revolutionary War (from 1775 to 1783).

The first settler, John Franklin, came from Connecticut as one of the Susquehanna landowners. He was soon followed by the families of Levi Seward, Nathaniel Goss, Abraham Hess, and Reuben Culver (all of whom were influential settlers in Huntington Township).

Finally, following the Revolutionary War, under the acts of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania passed in 1799, Huntington Township was created along with seventeen other certified townships in the counties of Luzerne, Lackawanna, Wyoming, Bradford, and Susquehanna.

Previous to the acts of the Assembly, Huntington Township was known as Bloomingdale Township and considered part of Connecticut. However, in 1799, once the township was inducted into Luzerne County, Bloomingdale Township was renamed Huntington Township after Samuel Huntington (one of the original signers of the Declaration of Independence).

<text>Jenkins Township is a township in the Greater Pittston area of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 4,282 at the 2020 census.

==History==
===Settlement===
Isaac Gould and Joseph Gardner were the first permanent settlers in modern-day Jenkins Township. The first important settlement in the territory was Joseph Gardner&#x27;s gristmill in 1794 (on Gardner&#x27;s Creek). The first schoolhouse was built in the early 1810s. Jenkins Township was formed from a section of Pittston Township on June 24, 1852. It was named after Col. John Jenkins (who settled the area with his family in 1769). He served as an officer in the American Revolution (1775-1782), and as a Representative of Luzerne County in the Pennsylvania Legislature (elected in 1797).

===Coal mining===
Logging and farming were the first major employers in the region, but due to the abundance of anthracite coal under the township, the coal mining industry quickly expanded. Port Griffith was named in honor of one of the original stockholders of the Pennsylvania Coal Company. Other villages in the township (e.g., Port Blanchard, Inkerman, and Sebastopol) also played an important role in the mining industry. On January 22, 1959, the Knox Mine Disaster in Port Griffith, Jenkins Township, claimed the lives of 12 people and essentially shut down the mining industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania.

===Contemporary history===
The coal companies left behind a scarred landscape (e.g., culm banks) when they pulled out of the region. Today, Jenkins Township&#x27;s economy is composed of an expanding warehousing industry. 
On September 25, 1982, George Banks killed thirteen people in a shooting rampage in Jenkins Township and Wilkes-Barre City.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.06%, is water. The township is served by the Pittston Area School District. It is drained by the Susquehanna River, which separates it from Wyoming and Exeter. The Eighth Street Bridge links Jenkins Township to Wyoming. The township&#x27;s villages include Ewen, Inkerman, Old Boston, Port Blanchard, Port Griffith, and Sebastopol.

Jenkins Township can be divided into two separate regions (connected by a small strip of land). The northwestern portion of the township borders the Susquehanna River; it is mostly made up of homes and businesses. There is a small strip of land connecting the northwestern portion of the township to the southeastern region of the township. This small strip is less than a quarter of a mile wide and is flanked by the Borough of Yatesville (to the north) and the Borough of Laflin (to the south). The southeastern region of Jenkins is the largest by total area. I-81, I-476, and PA 315 travel through this section of the municipality; there are a few neighborhoods and warehouses located near these highways. Thick forests make up the very southeastern section of the township.

<text>Kingston is a borough in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located on the western bank of the Susquehanna River opposite Wilkes-Barre. Kingston was first settled in the early 1770s, and incorporated as a borough in 1857. As of the 2020 census, the population was 13,349, making it the most populous borough in Luzerne County.

==History==
===Early history===
In the early 1660s, King Charles II owed Admiral Sir William Penn a large sum of money. To settle this debt, he granted Penn&#x27;s son, William, a territory in North America, which later became known as Pennsylvania. However, Connecticut also claimed a portion of this land.

Count Zinzendorf was one of the first people to take an interest in the Wyoming Valley. In 1742, he came to the region to convert the Native Americans to Christianity. At the time, the valley was inhabited by several Native American tribes (including the Susquehannock and the Delaware).

His reports led a group of Connecticut settlers to form the Connecticut Susquehanna Company. This company bought the land from the natives. In 1768, they met in Hartford, Connecticut, and decided to survey and divide the territory into five townships (each one was five square miles). The plan was to sell and divide each township among forty settlers. The first forty pioneers took possession of Kingston Township.

By the late 1760s, both Connecticut and Pennsylvania settlers fought over this territory. The conflict was eventually settled in the 1780s. The disputed land was granted to Pennsylvania. The location of modern-day Kingston became part of Northumberland County. However, Connecticut settlers remained determined to create a new state in northeastern Pennsylvania. Timothy Pickering was sent to the region to politically examine the situation. This led to the Pennsylvania Assembly passing a resolution which created Luzerne County. This ended the idea of creating a new state. Luzerne County was created from part of Northumberland County. Under Pickering&#x27;s leadership and direction, county elections were held, the courts were established, and a government was formed.

===Revolutionary War===

On June 30, 1778, Loyalist forces, under the command of Major John Butler, arrived in the Wyoming Valley to attack the American settlements. On July 1, Fort Wintermoot at the north end of the valley surrendered without a shot being fired. The next morning the smaller Fort Jenkins surrendered. Both forts were later burned to the ground.

Meanwhile, the Patriot militia assembled at Forty Fort. On July 3, a column of roughly 375 men including a company of soldiers in the Continental Army marched from the fort under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Zebulon Butler and Colonel Nathan Denison. Major Butler&#x27;s Rangers, with the assistance of about 500 indigenous allies, ambushed the oncoming Americans. In the end, nearly 300 Patriot soldiers from the Wyoming Valley were killed during the Battle of Wyoming, commonly known as the Wyoming Massacre.

The next day Colonel Denison surrendered Forty Fort along with several other posts. Widespread looting and burning of buildings occurred throughout the Wyoming Valley subsequent to the capitulation, but non-combatants were not harmed. Most of the inhabitants, however, fled across the Pocono Mountains to Stroudsburg and Easton or down the Susquehanna River to Sunbury.

===Incorporation===
The community has a rich history in American education. It is said that the first public school in Pennsylvania was erected in Kingston (in the 1770s). The borough is also home to the Upper School of Wyoming Seminary, a prestigious college preparatory school founded in 1844. During the first year, it enrolled 31 students (17 boys and 14 girls). Today, Wyoming Seminary&#x27;s historic campus hosts roughly 450 students.

Kingston witnessed a population boom after the construction and operation of the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad. It was incorporated as a borough on November 23, 1857. The borough is named after Kingston, Rhode Island. The first election for the community was held on December 15, 1857. Ruben Jones was elected burgess and justice of the peace. Some of the first council members elected included Bestor Payne, Marshall G. Whitney, Reuben Marcy, Thomas Pringle, and Richard Hutching.

In 1923, the Kingston Armory was built. On September 11, 1950, 33 guardsmen from the 109th Field Artillery Regiment were killed in a train accident near Coshocton, Ohio. In the following days, the dead were moved to the Kingston Armory, where the remains were relinquished to the grief-stricken families.

Coal mining was a chief industry in and around Kingston prior to the Knox Mine Disaster. The 1959 tragedy essentially shut down the mining industry in and around the borough. In June 1972, Kingston was devastated by the flooding of Hurricane Agnes. The hurricane wreaked havoc on Kingston and neighboring Wilkes-Barre, causing a state of emergency. The natural disaster earned national attention and a visit from President Richard Nixon, who recruited Wyoming Seminary graduate Frank Carlucci (Nixon&#x27;s head of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare) as a point man to oversee flood recovery efforts. After the flood, Kingston adopted a home rule charter. It became effective in January 1976.

<text>Kingston Township is a township in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 7,096 at the 2020 census. The villages of Trucksville and Shavertown are located within the township. It is home to Frances Slocum State Park. The township is described as &quot;the gateway to the Back Mountain&quot; (a 118 square mile region in northern Luzerne County). The area includes the townships of Dallas, Franklin, Jackson, Kingston, Lake, and Lehman. The region also includes the boroughs of Dallas and Harveys Lake.

==History==
===Establishment===
Kingston Township was one of the original townships formed by the Susquehanna Land Company of Connecticut in 1790. The township is named after Kingston, Rhode Island, and was originally called “Kingstown.” The township was later downsized when whole regions were stripped away to form new municipalities (i.e., townships and boroughs).

===Shavertown and Trucksville=== 
Shavertown is named for an early settler — Philip Shaver. In 1813, Philip purchased the land that would later become Shavertown from William Trucks, the namesake of Trucksville. That same year, Philip sold the northwest portion of his land to John McClellon. This land would be known as McClellonsville, a small village which was later named Dallas. By 1818, Philip still owned nearly one thousand acres of land in the Back Mountain region.

Philip Shaver was born in 1762 along the Danube River Valley in Vienna, Austria. He migrated to the United States between 1765 and 1769 with his parents and brothers. Philip Shaver married Mary Ann Wickizer at St. James Lutheran Church (in Greenwich, Warren County, New Jersey, on December 12, 1786). They had 7 children: John Philip, Peter, William G., Elizabeth, James Henry, George, and Asa W. Shaver. Around 1804, Philip and his family arrived in Forty Fort, where they resided until 1810. Philip came to the “Back of the Mountain” in search of a gigantic species of legendary evergreen trees. He was forced to carve out a path from a rugged foot trail and among heavily forested lands, now PA 309. Philip and his sons constructed a sawmill in 1815. This first mill was on the north branch of Toby Creek and located near the Prince of Peace Church on Main Street in Dallas.

In 1816, he donated a piece of land for the first school in the Back Mountain. The school was a one-room log cabin on the site of the current Back Mountain Memorial Library on Huntsville Road. Philip also set aside land for a public burying ground “on the hill near the pine grove just south of Dallas Village (on the road to Huntsville).” Philip also designated a plot of land for his family&#x27;s graves, visible from Overbrook Road. In 1826, Philip died after an accident. His left hand was crushed in the cider press that he and his sons were operating in November 1826. Philip was forced to amputate his own hand and died of blood poisoning a few days later on November 7, 1826.

=== Frances Slocum===
Frances Slocum State Park is located in Kingston Township. In 1968, the lake, which is the centerpiece of the park, was built to control flooding in the North Branch Susquehanna River. In 1972, the park became a temporary home to 280 families who were displaced by the Agnes flood. The park was closed to the public; it was not reopened until 1974 when all the families were relocated.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.87%, is water.

Kingston Township is densely populated in the southwestern section of the municipality; this is where the villages of Shavertown and Trucksville are located. PA 309 also travels through this portion of the township.

Kingston Township is known as &quot;the gateway to the Back Mountain,&quot; because two major roadways — PA 309 and West Eighth Street (in the northeastern section of the municipality) — link the Back Mountain (Kingston Township) to the Anthracite Valley (also known as the Wyoming Valley). Frances Slocum State Park is located in the northeastern portion of the township. Carverton Road runs through the center of Kingston Township and links PA 309 to West Eighth Street. Farms and forests are located in the northern and southern sections of the municipality.

Kingston Township is part of Dallas School District (which encompasses approximately 46 square miles).

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 7,145 people, 2,745 households, and 2,083 families residing in the township. The population density was . There were 2,923 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the township was 98.95% White, 0.24% African American, 0.06% Native American, 0.28% Asian, 0.08% from other races, and 0.39% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.38% of the population.

There were 2,745 households, out of which 35.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 64.7% were married couples living together, 8.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.1% were non-families. 20.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.60 and the average family size was 3.02.

In the township the population was spread out, with 24.9% under the age of 18, 6.4% from 18 to 24, 28.9% from 25 to 44, 27.1% from 45 to 64, and 12.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.2 males.

The median income for a household in the township was $52,997, and the median income for a family was $62,435. Males had a median income of $40,872 versus $30,075 for females. The per capita income for the township was $23,885. About 4.2% of families and 4.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.2% of those under age 18 and 3.6% of those age 65 or over.

<text>The Vickers Wellington (nicknamed the Wimpy) is a British twin-engined, long-range medium bomber. It was designed during the mid-1930s at Brooklands in Weybridge, Surrey. Led by Vickers-Armstrongs&#x27; chief designer Rex Pierson, a key feature of the aircraft is its geodetic airframe fuselage structure, which was principally designed by Barnes Wallis. Development had been started in response to Air Ministry Specification B.9/32, issued in the middle of 1932, for a bomber for the Royal Air Force.

This specification called for a twin-engined day bomber capable of delivering higher performance than any previous design. Other aircraft developed to the same specification include the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley and the Handley Page Hampden. During the development process, performance requirements such as for the tare weight changed substantially, and the engine used was not the one originally intended.

Despite the original specification, the Wellington was used as a night bomber in the early years of the Second World War, performing as one of the principal bombers used by Bomber Command. During 1943, it started to be superseded as a bomber by the larger four-engined &quot;heavies&quot; such as the Avro Lancaster. The Wellington continued to serve throughout the war in other duties, particularly as an anti-submarine aircraft with RAF Coastal Command.

The Wellington was the only British bomber that was produced for the duration of the war, and was produced in a greater quantity than any other British-built bomber. The Wellington remained as first-line equipment when the war ended, although it had been increasingly relegated to secondary roles. The Wellington was one of two bombers named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, the other being the Vickers Wellesley.

A larger heavy bomber aircraft designed to Specification B.1/35, the Vickers Warwick, was developed in parallel with the Wellington; the two aircraft shared around 85% of their structural components. Many elements of the Wellington were also re-used in a civil derivative, the Vickers VC.1 Viking.

==Development==
===Origins===
In October 1932, the British Air Ministry invited Vickers to tender for the recently issued Specification B.9/32, which sought a twin-engine medium daylight bomber. In response, Vickers conducted a design study, led by Chief Designer Rex Pierson. Early on, Vickers&#x27; chief structures designer Barnes Wallis proposed the use of a geodetic airframe, inspired by his previous work on airships and the single-engined Wellesley light bomber. During structural testing performed at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, the proposed structure demonstrated not only the required strength factor of six, but reached 11 without any sign of failure, proving the geodetic airframe to possess a strength far in excess of normal levels. This strength allowed for the structure design to be further developed to reduce the size of individual members and adopt simplified standard sections of lighter construction.

Vickers studied and compared the performance of various air- and liquid-cooled engines to power the bomber, including the Bristol Pegasus IS2, Pegasus IIS2, and Armstrong Siddeley Tiger radials, and the Rolls-Royce Goshawk I inline. The Pegasus was selected as the engine for air-cooled versions of the bomber, while the Goshawk engine was chosen for the liquid-cooled engine variant. On 28 February 1933, two versions of the aircraft, one with each of the selected powerplants, were submitted to the tender. In September 1933, the Air Ministry issued a pilot contract for the Goshawk-powered version. In August 1934, Vickers proposed to use either the Pegasus or the sleeve-valve 9-cylinder radial Bristol Perseus engines instead of the evaporative-cooled Goshawk, which promised improvements in speed, climb rate, ceiling, and single-engine flight capabilities without any major increase in all-up weight; the Air Ministry accepted the proposed changes.

Other refinements of the design had also been implemented and approved, such as the adoption of variable-pitch propellers, and the use of Vickers-produced gun turrets in the nose and tail positions. By December 1936, the specification had been revised to include front, rear, and midship wind-protected turret mountings. Other specification changes included modified bomb undershields and the inclusion of spring-loaded bomb bay doors. The proposal had also been developed further, a mid-wing arrangement was adopted instead of a shoulder-mounted wing for greater pilot visibility during formation flight and improved aerodynamic performance, as well as a substantially increased overall weight of the aircraft. Design studies were also conducted on behalf of the Air Ministry into the adoption of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine.

In spite of a traditional preference of the establishment to strictly adhere to the restrictive tare weight for the aircraft established in the tender, both Pierson and Wallis firmly believed that their design should adopt the most powerful engine available. Perhaps in response to pressure from Vickers, the Air Ministry overlooked, if not openly accepted, the removal of the tare weight restriction, as between the submission of the tender in 1933 and the flight of the first prototype in 1936, the tare weight eventually rose from to . The prescribed bomb load and range requirements were routinely revised upwards by the Air Ministry; by November 1935, figures within the Ministry were interested in the possibility of operating the aircraft at an all-up weight of , which aviation author C.F. Andrews described as &quot;a very high figure for a medium bomber of those days&quot;.

During the development phase of the aircraft, as C F Andrews puts it &quot;the political and military climate of Europe was changing rapidly. The threats of the dictators of Germany and Italy began to exert pressure on the British Government to make a reappraisal of the strength of its armed forces, especially that of the Royal Air Force&quot;. By 1936, the need for a high priority to be placed on the creation of a large bomber force, which would form the spearhead of British offensive power, had been recognised; accordingly, a new command organisation within the RAF, Bomber Command, was formed that year to deliver upon this requirement.

===Prototype and design revision===
In early 1936, an initial prototype, &quot;K4049&quot;, which was originally designated as a &quot;Type 271&quot;, was assembled. The prototype could accommodate a payload of nine or bombs, and both nose and tail gun positions were fitted with hand-operated turrets with a gun in each; provision for a third retractable gun in a dorsal position was made. It had provision for a crew of four, along with a fifth position for special duties.

On 5 June 1936, the name &quot;Crecy&quot; was chosen for the type, and it was publicly displayed as such. On 15 August 1936, the aircraft was accepted for production. On 8 September 1936, the service name &quot;Wellington&quot; was adopted for the type; it fitted with Air Ministry nomenclature of naming bombers after towns and followed the Vickers Wellesley in referring to the Napoleonic War general Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington. On 12 December 1936, a corresponding works order was issued for the Wellington.

On 15 June 1936, &quot;K4049&quot; conducted its maiden flight from Brooklands. Vickers chief test pilot Joseph Summers flew &quot;K4049&quot; on its first flight, accompanied by Wallis and Trevor Westbrook. The aircraft soon came to be widely regarded as being an advanced design for its era and proved to have considerable merit during its flight trials. On 19 April 1937, &quot;K4049&quot; was destroyed by an accident during a service test flight by Maurice Hare. The cause was the failure of the elevator&#x27;s horn balance due to excessive slipstream exposure, leading to the aircraft inverting and rapidly descending into terrain. It was destroyed in the crash, which also resulted in the death of the navigator, Smurthwaite. The horn balances were later deleted from the design and were not on production aircraft.

Refinement of the Wellington&#x27;s design was influenced by the issuing of Specifications B.3/34 and B.1/35, the latter of which led a larger bomber aircraft, the Vickers Warwick With detail design work on both being done at same time and both aircraft using geodetic-inspired construction there was commonality in components. The production model Wellington was a complete redesign, resulting in a lengthened nose for turret and bomb aimer&#x27;s position, a reshaped elevator and deepened fuselage which accommodated a larger bombload and the increased crew from four to five members. Other changes made included the adoption of a retractable tailwheel and constant-speed propellers; the Air Ministry also requested the adoption of a Nash &amp; Thompson-design ventral turret in place of the Vickers design.

On 23 December 1937, the first production &quot;Wellington Mk I&quot;, &quot;L4212&quot;, conducted its first flight, followed by an intensive flight programme. Flight trials with &quot;L4212&quot; confirmed the aerodynamic stability initially encountered by &quot;K4049&quot;, but also revealed the aircraft to be nose-heavy during dives, which was attributed to the redesigned elevator. Modifications, including the linking of the flaps and the elevator trim tabs, were tested on &quot;L4212&quot; and resolved the problem.

===Production===
In August 1936, an initial order for 180 &quot;Wellington Mk I&quot; aircraft, powered by a pair of 1,050 hp (780 kW) Bristol Pegasus radial engines, was received by Vickers; it had been placed so rapidly that the order occurred prior to the first meeting intended to decide the details of the production aircraft.

In October 1937, an order was placed with Gloster Aircraft Company for production of 100 Wellington Mk Is to be followed by 100 Wellington Mk II aircraft with Rolls-Royce Merlin X . Another order was placed for 64 Wellingtons to be produced by Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft at Coventry With this flurry of order and production having been assured by the end of 1937, Vickers set about simplifying the manufacturing process of the aircraft and announced a target of building one Wellington per day.
The geodetic design took longer to build than comparable aircraft using the more conventional monocoque approach, leading to some criticism of the Wellington. In addition it was difficult to cut holes in the fuselage for access or equipment fixtures; to aid manufacturing, the Leigh light was deployed through the mounting for the absent FN9 ventral turret.

The Gloster and AWA contracts were transferred to Shadow factories in the north-west. In the late 1930s, Vickers built Wellingtons at a rate of one per day at Weybridge and 50 a month at Broughton in North Wales. Many of the employees on the production lines were only semi-skilled and new to aircraft construction. Peak wartime production in 1942 saw monthly rates of 70 at Weybridge, 130 at Broughton and 102 at Blackpool. Shadow factories were set up to produce parts for the Wellington all over the British Isles.

In October 1943, as a propaganda and morale-boosting exercise, workers at Broughton gave up their weekend to build Wellington number LN514 rushed by the clock. The bomber was assembled in 23 hours 50 minutes, and took off after 24 hours 48 minutes, beating the record of 48 hours set by a factory in California. Each Wellington was usually built within 60 hours. It was filmed for the Ministry of Information for a newsreel &quot;Worker&#x27;s Week-End&quot;, and was broadcast in both Britain and America. It was the first time in aviation history that an aircraft manufacturer anywhere in the world had attempted such a feat with a metal aircraft of this scale.

A total of 180 Wellington Mk I aircraft were built; 150 for the RAF and 30 for the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) (which were transferred to the RAF on the outbreak of war and used by 75 Squadron). In October 1938, the Mk I entered service with 9 Squadron. The Wellington was initially outnumbered by the Handley Page Hampden (also ordered by the Ministry to B.9/32) and the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley (to B.34/3 for a &#x27;night&#x27; bomber) but outlasted both rival aircraft in service. The Wellington went on to be built in 16 variants and two post-war training conversions. The number of Wellingtons built totalled 11,462 of all versions, a greater quantity produced than any other British bomber. On 13 October 1945, the last Wellington to be produced rolled out.

===Further development===
The Wellington Mk I was quickly superseded by improved variants. Improvements to the turrets and the strengthening of the undercarriage quickly resulted in the &quot;Wellington Mk IA&quot;. The Mk IA was specified to be based on the Merlin X engined Wellington Mk II design and was in theory to be able to be fitted with either Merlins or Pegasus but in practice only radials were fitted. The Mark IA was stressed to the Mark II and had stronger undercarriage with larger wheels and Frazer-Nash turrets.

Due to difficulties with performance of the Vickers turrets on the Mark I that left the Wellington with weaker than intended defences, production of Wellington Mk IB with Frazer Nash armament was proposed for trials but since the Frazer-Nash turrets were already being accepted for the Mark IA, the Mark IB may not have been built or if built re-designated as Mark IA. Further development of various aspects of the aircraft, using knowledge learned was incorporated into the airframe at Weybridge by executive decision. Redesigned hydraulics and 24 volt electrical systems, along with a replacement of the ventral turret gun with two beam machine guns (either .303 Vickers K, or Browning), was designated Wellington Mk IC and a Type number generated after the fact.

In January 1938, design work on what would become the &quot;Wellington Mk II&quot; formally commenced. The principal change on this model was the adoption of the Merlin engine in place of the Pegasus XVIII; other modifications included hydraulic and oxygen system revisions along with the installation of cabin heating and an astrodome. On 3 March 1939, &quot;L4250&quot;, the prototype Mk II, performed its maiden flight; this had been delayed due to production delays of its Merlin X engines. Stability and balance problems were encountered during flight tests of the prototype, resulting in further changes such as the enlargement of the tailplane. By late 1939, the Mk II was capable of delivering superior performance to the Mk IC, such as higher cruising and top speeds, increased all-up weight or alternatively greater range and a raised ceiling.

==Design==

The Vickers Wellington was a twin-engined long-range medium bomber, initially powered by a pair of Bristol Pegasus radial engines, which drove a pair of de Havilland two-pitch propellers. Various engines and propeller combinations were used on variants of the aircraft, which included models of the Bristol Hercules and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines. Recognisable characteristics of the Wellington include the high aspect ratio of its tapered wing, the depth of its fuselage and the use of a tall single fin on its tail unit, which reportedly aided in recognition of the type.

The Wellington typically had a crew of five, the bomb-aimer being located in the aircraft&#x27;s nose. The Wellington could be fitted with dual flight controls, and specialised dual-control conversion sets were developed for the purpose of performing training upon the type. The cockpit also contained provisions for heating and de-icing equipment, which was introduced on later models of the Wellington. The Wellington Mk I had a maximum offensive bomb load of , more than one-fifth of the aircraft&#x27;s all-up weight. Additional munitions and an expanded bombing capacity were changes in many of the wartime variants of the Wellington, including the carrying of larger bombs.
Defensive armament comprised the forward and tail turret gun positions, along with a retractable revolving ventral turret. Due to the high cruising speeds of the Wellington, it had been realised that fully enclosed turrets, as opposed to semi-enclosed or exposed turrets, would be necessary; the turrets were also power-operated to traverse with the speed and manoeuvrability necessary to keep up with the new generations of opposing fighter aircraft. The Vickers design put the gunner in a fixed seat behind the guns (a pair of .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns. ) which were mounted on a pillar with a Nash &amp; Thompson control unit, and fired through a moving slot in the framed canopy. Although roomy, there were problems with malfunctions and poor gunnery and Vickers were given a directive by the Air Staff to replace them. At the same time a development contract was placed with Nash &amp; Thompson for a turret that could be used for both front and rear positions. The resulting FN.5 was also used on Short Stirling and Avro Manchester

Due to the specialised nature of increasingly advanced turrets, these were treated as ancillary equipment, being designed and supplied independently and replacing Vickers&#x27; own turrets developed for the aircraft. The Vickers-built ventral turret of the Mk I was replaced by a Nash &amp; Thompson-built FN.25 counterpart as standard. The squadrons were critical of the ventral turrets; when extended they slowed the aircraft by 10 mph, the single narrow window pane limited visibility and sometimes froze in place and had to be jettisoned. The ventral turrets were not fitted after the first batch of Wellington IA
A novelty of the Wellington was its geodetic construction, devised by aircraft designer and inventor Barnes Wallis. The fuselage was built from 1,650 elements, consisting of duralumin W-beams which formed into a metal framework. Wooden battens were screwed to the beams and were covered with Irish linen; the linen, treated with layers of dope, formed the outer skin of the aircraft. The construction proved to be compatible with significant adaptations and alterations including greater all-up weight, larger bombs, tropicalisation and long-range fuel tanks.

The metal lattice gave the structure considerable strength, with any stringer able to support a portion of load from the opposite side of the aircraft. Damaged or destroyed beams on one side could still leave the aircraft structure viable; as a result, Wellingtons with huge areas of framework missing were often able to return when other types would not have survived, leading to stories of the aircraft&#x27;s &quot;invulnerability&quot;. The effect was enhanced by the fabric skin occasionally burning off leaving the naked frames exposed. A further advantage of the geodetic construction of the wings was its enabling of a unique method for housing the fuel, with each wing containing three fuel tanks within the unobstructed space provided between the front and rear spars outboard of the engines. A disadvantage of the geodetic fuselage structure was its insufficient lengthwise stiffness: when fitted with attachment for towing cargo gliders, its structure &quot;gave&quot; and stretched slightly.

==Operational history==
On 3 September 1939, the same day the United Kingdom declared war on Germany in response to the invasion of Poland, No. 3 Group Bomber Command based in East Anglia comprised six front line squadrons (No. 9, No. 37, No. 38, No. 99, No. 115 and No. 149 Squadrons) and two reserve squadrons (No. 214 and No. 215 squadrons), all equipped with a mixture of Wellington Mk I and Mk IA aircraft.

On 4 September 1939, less than 24 hours after the commencement of hostilities, a total of 14 Wellingtons of No. 9 and No. 149 Squadrons, alongside a number of Bristol Blenheim aircraft, performed the first RAF bombing raid of the war, against German shipping at Brunsbüttel. The bombing of the harbour had not been permitted by Chamberlain&#x27;s War Cabinet for fear of injuring civilians. The effectiveness of the raid was diminished by poor weather and high amounts of anti-aircraft fire. A pair of Wellingtons became the first aircraft to be lost on the Western Front.

On 3 December 1939, 24 Wellingtons of No. 38, No. 115 and No. 147 Squadrons attacked the German fleet moored at Heligoland. The bombing commenced from high altitude and, while results of the bombing itself proved negligible, the ability of a formation of Wellingtons to penetrate strongly defended hostile airspace was validated. On 14 December 1939, 12 Wellingtons of No. 99 Squadron conducted a low-level raid upon German shipping at the Schillig Roads and Wilhelmshaven. Encountering enemy fire from warships, flak, and &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft, the Wellington formation lost five aircraft, along with another that crashed near its base, while only one enemy fighter was shot down.

On 18 December 1939, 24 Wellingtons of No. 9, No. 37 and No. 149 Squadrons participated in the Battle of the Heligoland Bight against the German fleet and naval bases in both the Schillig Roads and Wilhelmshaven. The Wellingtons were unable to drop their bombs as all vessels were in harbour, thus restrictions on endangering civilians prevented their engagement. Having been alerted by radar, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighter aircraft intercepted the incoming bombers near to Heligoland and attacked the formation for much of the way home. Twelve of the bombers were destroyed and a further three were badly damaged. The Wellingtons shot down four aircraft.
The action at Heligoland highlighted the Wellington&#x27;s vulnerability to attacking fighters, possessing neither self-sealing fuel tanks nor sufficient defensive armament. The nose and tail turrets protected against attacks from the front and rear, the Wellington had no defences against attacks from the beam and above, as it had not been believed that such attacks were possible owing to the high speed of aircraft involved and the deflection shooting required. Unescorted day bombing was abandoned and Bomber Command decided to use the Wellington force to attack German communications and industrial targets instead.
The Wellington was converted for night operations; on 25 August 1940, the type participated in the first night raid on Berlin. During the First 1,000 bomber raid, on Cologne on 30 May 1942, 599 out of 1,046 RAF aircraft dispatched were Wellingtons; of these, 101 were flown by Polish aircrew. During operations under Bomber Command, Wellingtons flew 47,409 operations, dropped 41,823 tons (37,941 tonnes) of bombs and lost 1,332 aircraft in action.

In one incident, a German Messerschmitt Bf 110 night-fighter attacked a Wellington returning from an attack on Münster, causing a fire at the rear of the starboard engine. The second pilot, Sergeant James Allen Ward (RNZAF) climbed out of the fuselage, kicked holes in the doped fabric of the wing for foot and hand holds to reach the starboard engine and smothered the burning upper wing covering. He and the aircraft returned home safely and Ward was awarded the Victoria Cross. A unique feat for the type occurred on 23 December 1944 when a Me 163 Komet was shot down by rear gunner Gerry Elsyon, who was awarded the DFM.

In 1942 the Wellington was adapted to conduct night anti-shipping torpedo attacks against German and Italian shipping in the Mediterranean. The torpedo-carrying Wellington was nicknamed the &quot;Fishington&quot;, and the radar equipped Wellingtons that guided the torpedo carrying aircraft onto their target were dubbed the &quot;Snoopington&quot;. 38 Squadron, based in Shallufah, Egypt had a detachment of Wellingtons operating from RAF Luqa in Malta conducting anti-shipping operations with torpedoes during 1942. 

The Wellington was also adopted by RAF Coastal Command, in which it contributed to the Battle of the Atlantic. The Mark IC in Coastal had a endurance of over ten hours at a cruising speed of 125 knots carrying of bombs or depth charges. It was used for anti-submarine operations; on 6 July 1942, a Wellington sank its first enemy vessel. In 1944, Wellingtons of Coastal Command were sent to Greece and performed various support duties during the British intervention in the Greek Civil War. A few Wellingtons were operated by the Hellenic Air Force.

While the Wellington was superseded in the European Theatre as more four engined bombers arrived in service, it remained in operational service for much of the war in the Middle East and still formed a key part of the RAF&#x27;s Mediterranean forces as the allies moved into Italy, with some still serving in March 1945 carrying out bombing raids and dropping supplies to partisans across Southern Europe.

In 1942, Wellingtons based in India became the RAF&#x27;s first long-range bombers operating in the Far East with the arrival of 99 and 215 Squadrons RAF, providing much needed bombing support for the next two years before being withdrawn and replaced by Liberators in the summer of 1944. Wellingtons were also used for maritime patrols over the Indian Ocean by 36, and later, 203 Squadrons RAF.

The Wellington also served in anti-submarine duties off the African cost with 26 Squadron SAAF based in Takoradi, Gold Coast (now Ghana), and the Free French 344 Squadron from Dakar.

===Mine clearance ===
Specialised &quot;Directional Wireless Installation&quot; (DWI), a cover story for the true purpose of the hoop variants, fitted with a diameter metal hoop, were used for exploding German magnetic mines by generating a powerful magnetic field as it passed over them. The first successful mine detonation occurred on 8 January 1940 followed by a second on 13 January. In the latter the aircraft flew below the safe 35 ft altitude and was caught in the explosive blast though remained flyable. The hoop was an aluminium coil in an aerodynamic balsa case; turrets were faired over and unnecessary equipment removed to reduce weight. The first mine detonation unit No. 1 GRU at RAF Manston was joined by a second (No. 2 GRU) at RAF Bircham Newton. To protect the unarmed Wellingtons, Bristol Blenheims of No. 600 Squadron RAF flew escort during the Battle of France. One DWI was detached to the Middle East to act as the pattern for conversion of Wellingtons there. They were used for clearing the Suez Canal Zone and, later during the North Africa campaign, ports along the coast.

=== Anti-submarine ===
For the development of what became the Leigh light, squadron leader Leigh fitted a 24-inch search light in the &#x27;dustbin&#x27; turret of a DWI Wellington testing it from January 1941. This prototype substituted batteries for the engine and generator setup to reduce weight and this carried forward into production Leigh light-equipped Wellingtons Together with accurate radar altimeters, Wellingtons could fly safely down to 50 ft, illuminating the target submarine at around half a mile away just as the air-to-surface-vessel (ASV) radar lost the target among returns from the water&#x27;s surface.

===Airborne radar===
In late 1944, a radar-equipped Wellington XIV from 407 Sqn. RCAF was modified for use by the RAF&#x27;s Fighter Interception Unit as what would now be described as an airborne early warning and control aircraft. It operated at an altitude of over the North Sea to control a de Havilland Mosquito and a Bristol Beaufighter fighter intercepting Heinkel He 111 bombers flying from Dutch airbases and carrying out airborne launches of the V-1 flying bomb. The FIU operators on the Wellington would search for the He 111 aircraft climbing to launch altitude, then direct the Beaufighter to attack the bomber, while the Mosquito would attempt to intercept the V-1 if it was launched.

==Variants==

===Bomber variants===

;Type 271: The first Wellington bomber prototype.

;Type 285 Wellington Mark I: One pre-production prototype. Powered by two Bristol Pegasus X radial piston engines.

;Type 290 Wellington Mark I: The first production version. Powered by two 1,000 hp (750 kW) Bristol Pegasus XVIII radial piston engines. Fitted with Vickers gun turrets, 183 built at Weybridge and Broughton in Flintshire.

;Type 408 Wellington Mark IA: Production version built to B Mark II specifications with provision for either Pegasus or Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, although only 1,000 hp (750 kW) Pegasus XVIII engines were used in practice. Main landing gear moved forward 3 in (8 cm). Fitted with Nash &amp; Thompson gun turrets. 187 built at Weybridge and Broughton in Flintshire.

;Type 416 Wellington Mark IC: The first main production variant was the Mark IC which added waist guns to the Mark IA. A total of 2,685 were produced. The Mark IC had a crew of six: a pilot, radio operator, navigator/bomb aimer, observer/nose gunner, tail gunner and waist gunner. A total of 2,685 were built at Weybridge, Broughton in Flintshire and Blackpool.
;Type 406 Wellington Mark II: The B Mark II was identical to the Mark IC with the exception of the powerplant; using the 1,145 hp (855 kW) Rolls-Royce Merlin X engine instead. A total of 401 were produced at Weybridge.

;: The next significant variant was the B Mark III which featured the Bristol Hercules III or XI engine and a four-gun tail turret, instead of two-gun. A total of 1,519 Mark IIIs were built, becoming mainstays of Bomber Command from late 1941 through into 1942, with all but the two prototypes being built at Broughton in Flintshire and at Blackpool. After trials in 1942, the Wellington III was cleared to tow Hotspur, Hadrian and Horsa gliders, although this was observed to have an adverse effect on the geodetic structure. The Wellington III was also seen over Salisbury Plain while towing Spitfires. This would have allowed Spitfire reinforcements for the defence of Malta to be towed from Gibraltar to within range of Malta before being released. Whether this was done is unconfirmed.

;Type 424 Wellington B Mark IV: The 220 B Mark IV Wellingtons used the 1,200 hp (900 kW) Pratt &amp; Whitney Twin Wasp engine and were flown by two Polish and two RAAF squadrons. A total of 220 were built at Broughton in Flintshire.

;Type 442 Wellington B Mark VI: Pressurised with a long wingspan and 1,600 hp (1,190 kW) Merlin R6SM (60-series, two-stage) engines, 63 were produced and were operated by 109 Squadron and as Gee radio navigation trainers. A total of 63 were built at Weybridge. Fitted with Sperry bombsight. The B.VI&#x27;s high-altitude fuselage design optimised for pressurisation had a solid, bullet-like nose with no nose turret, and a cockpit with an astrodome-like bubble canopy. The rear turret was a remotely operated FN.20 sighted from a dome in the cockpit. This is the aircraft that spurred Rolls-Royce into developing the two-stage supercharged Merlin 60-series engine.

;: The most widely produced variant of which 3,804 were built. It was similar to the Mark III except for the 1,675 hp (1,250 kW) Hercules XVIII powerplant. The Mark X was the basis for a number of Coastal Command versions. A total of 3,803 were built at Broughton in Flintshire and Blackpool.

;Type 298 Wellington Mark II prototype: one aircraft L4250; powered by two 1,145 hp (854 kW) Rolls-Royce Merlin inline piston engines.

;Type 299 Wellington Mark III prototype: two only.

;Type 410 Wellington Mark IV prototype: Serial R1220; powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney Twin Wasp radial piston engines.

;Type 416 Wellington (II): The original Wellington II prototype was converted with the installation of a 40 mm (1.57 in) Vickers S gun with predictor gunsight in the dorsal position. This was the planned armament to be mounted in the nose of the Vickers Type 414 twin-engined fighter for which the Air Ministry raised specification F22.39. The armament was first flown on 25 October 1940 and test fired 8 November 

;Type 418 Wellington DWI (Detonation Without Impact) Mark I: Conversion of four Wellington Mark IAs to minesweeping aircraft for exploding magnetic mines. Fitted with Ford V-8 petrol engine and Mawdsley electrical generator to induce magnetic field in a diameter loop mounted under fuselage. They had a solid nose with a bracket supporting the loop, which was also supported under the rear fuselage and the wings, outboard of the engines. DWI was also known as &quot;Directional Wireless Installation&quot; – to mislead the true purpose of the loop.

;Type 419 Wellington DWI Mark II: DWI Mark I aircraft upgraded by installation of de Havilland Gipsy Six engine for increased generation power. 11 aircraft were converted to this standard. They were operated by No. 1 General Reconnaissance Unit, RAF, sweeping mines in the Thames Estuary for a short time until the Royal Navy had an equivalent capability to sweep magnetic mines. The unit was transferred to Egypt for use in the Suez Canal.

;Type 407 and Type 421 Wellington Mark V : Second and first prototypes respectively: three were built, designed for pressurised, high-altitude operations using turbocharged Hercules VIII engines.

;Wellington Mark VI: One Wellington Mark V with Merlin 60-series engines, high-altitude prototype only.

;Type 470 and Type 486 Wellington: Designations of two Wellington Mark II aircraft fitted with the Whittle W2B and W2/700 jet engines respectively.

;Type 478 Wellington Mark X: one Wellington was used to test the Bristol Hercules 100 engine.

;Type 602 Wellington Mark X: one Wellington was fitted with two Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engines.

;Wellington Mark III: one Wellington was used for glider tug, for glider clearance for Waco Hadrian, General Aircraft Hotspur and Airspeed Horsa gliders.

===Total built===
A total number of 11,461 aircraft is most often quoted. There is some question over several aircraft, the total may be a few either side of this figure. In combination, the Wellingtons and 846 Warwicks represent over 75 per cent of the total number of aircraft built by the Vickers-Armstrong company.

==Aircraft on display==
There are two complete surviving Vickers Wellingtons preserved in the United Kingdom. Some other substantial parts also survive.
Wellington IA serial number N2980 is owned by Brooklands Museum at Brooklands, Surrey. Built at Brooklands and first flown in November 1939, this aircraft took part in the RAF&#x27;s daylight bombing raids on Germany early in the Second World War but later lost power during a training flight on 31 December 1940 and ditched in Loch Ness. All the occupants survived except the rear gunner, who was killed when his parachute failed to open. The aircraft was recovered from the bottom of Loch Ness in September 1985 and restored in the late 1980s and 1990s. A new Wellington exhibition featuring N2980 was officially opened by Robin Holmes (who led the recovery team), Penelope Keith (as trustee of Brooklands Museum), Norman Parker (who worked for Vickers) and Ken Wallis (who flew Wellingtons operationally) on 15 June 2011, the 75th anniversary of the first flight of the type&#x27;s effective prototype in 1936.

On 15 September 2016, after having its outer wings removed the day before, N2980 was towed from the Bellman hangar in which it was restored and where it had been displayed for nearly 30 years. This move was the first time that &#x27;R&#x27; for &#x27;Robert&#x27; had moved on its undercarriage since its last flight in 1940. The aircraft was exhibited in a temporary building while the Bellman hangar was relocated and restored until taken off display and moved back into the latter building on 25 July 2017. The aeroplane is the centre-piece of the &#x27;Brooklands Aircraft Factory&#x27; exhibition about the aircraft industry at Brooklands, which was formally opened on 13 November 2017.

Wellington T.10 serial number MF628 is held by the Royal Air Force Museum. It was delivered to RAF No.18 MU (Maintenance Unit) for storage at RAF Tinwald Downs, Dumfries, as a Wellington B.X, on 11 May 1944. In March 1948 the front gun turret was removed in its conversion to a T.10 for its role as a postwar aircrew trainer. This aircraft is the Wellington seen taking off in &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; and was also used for some air-to-air photography on the movie.

This aircraft made the last flight of a Wellington, from Aston Down to Wisley, in January 1955. The RAF Museum later refitted the front gun turret in keeping with its original build as a B.X (wartime mark numbers used Roman numerals, Arabic numerals were adopted postwar). In Autumn 2010, this aircraft was taken to the RAF Museum&#x27;s site at Cosford for restoration.

<doc id="133064" wikidata="Q6478097" url="?curid=133064" title="Lake Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania">
<text>Lake Township is a township that is located in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the Back Mountain, a 118-square mile region in northern Luzerne County. The population was 1,994 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==

The first white man who lived in modern-day Lake Township was Matthew Scouten (in the 1790s). &quot;Hollenback &amp; Urquhart&quot; would later own much of the territory, and was responsible for building the first sawmill in 1839 and the first gristmill in 1840. Every mill belonging to &quot;Hollenback &amp; Urquhart&quot; was later transferred over to the &quot;Hoffman Lumber Company&quot;. At the time, due to the abundance of trees, the lumber industry was one of the major employers in the region.

Lake Township was formed in 1841 from territory taken from Lehman and Monroe Townships. It was named after Harveys Lake, which was originally part of the township. In 1842, Wyoming County was formed and the county line cut off a portion of Lake Township, which was given back to Monroe Township (now in Wyoming County).

The &quot;Harveys Lake and Towanda Branch&quot; of the Lehigh Valley Railroad was built during the late 1800s. It ran directly from Wilkes-Barre to Harveys Lake.

During the 1890s, railroad lines were established from the lake to the communities of Pittston and Towanda. Harveys Lake became a major tourist destination in the township. Warden Place and Sandy Beach became popular recreational areas near the lake in the early 1900s.

Within this same time period, there were three hotels, two hundred cottages, sixty boathouses, and four steamboats on Harveys Lake. The steamers were used for carrying passengers and freight. Recreational steamboat rides on the lake were commonplace between 1900 and 1920. In 1968, Lake Township lost its major tourist attraction — Harveys Lake. The region around the lake broke away from the township and was incorporated as a borough.

Today, the township is made up of thick forests and farmland.

<text>John Parmenter Robarts (January 11, 1917 – October 18, 1982) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the 17th premier of Ontario from 1961 to 1971. He was a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario.

==Early life==
Robarts was born in Banff, Alberta, to Herbert Roberts and Ellen Florence May Robarts, making him the only Ontario premier not to have been born in Ontario. As a young man, he moved to London, Ontario, with his family, where he studied at Central Collegiate (today, London Central Secondary School) and at the University of Western Ontario (UWO) in business administration. While attending UWO, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity.

Robarts enrolled to study law at Osgoode Hall Law School, but his education was interrupted by service with the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II. He served as an officer on . After the war, he returned to law school and graduated in 1948.

==Early political career==
Robarts practiced law in London, Ontario, and was elected to city council in 1948. In 1951, he was elected as a member of provincial parliament (MPP) to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, as a Progressive Conservative (PC) from the city. In that era, MPPs not in cabinet were essentially working part-time due to relatively light legislative duties. Robarts commuted by train from the Queen&#x27;s Park legislature in Toronto, the provincial capital, to his family and law practice in London, effectively combining his legislative work with his legal career. His wife Norah disliked Toronto and remained at home in London for most of their marriage. The couple raised two children.

He entered the cabinet of Leslie Frost in 1958 as minister without portfolio, and was promoted to minister of education in 1959. The province was in the midst of a major building phase with its education system, to accommodate an enormous increase in enrollment following the Baby Boomer generation of the post-World War II era, and Robarts played an important role as education minister, with the establishment of new institutions such as York University.

==Premier of Ontario==
In 1961, Robarts became the 17th premier of Ontario, and served in that capacity until 1971. He was an advocate of individual freedoms, and promoted the rights of the provinces against the centralizing initiatives of the federal government. He also promoted national unity against Quebec separatism, and hosted the 1967 &quot;Confederation of Tomorrow&quot; conference in Toronto. Although unsuccessful attempt to achieve an agreement for a new Constitution of Canada, Robarts has been praised for facilitating interprovincial dialogue with Quebec.

He initially opposed Canadian Medicare when it was proposed, but later endorsed it fully following New Democratic Party (NDP) candidate Kenneth Bolton&#x27;s upset by-election victory on the issue in the London-area riding of Middlesex South.

As a civil libertarian, and a strong believer in the promotion of both official languages, Robarts opened the door to French language education in Ontario schools. In 1972 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.

Nicknamed &quot;the Chairman of the Board&quot; during his tenure, Robarts is remembered for his steps to promote and improve education. He was responsible for the construction of five new universities including York University, the establishment of the Ontario Science Centre and Ontario Place, the creation of numerous teacher&#x27;s colleges, the creation of the community college system, the GO Transit commuter rail system, introducing nuclear power to Ontario&#x27;s electricity grid, and launching the Ontario Scholar fund for high school students graduating with an A average. Throughout his premiership, Robarts had balanced budgets every year.

==Later life==
After retiring from office, Robarts co-chaired the Task Force on Canadian Unity with Jean-Luc Pépin, and joined a Toronto law firm as well as the boards of directors of several major corporations.

He served as chancellor of the University of Western Ontario from 1971 to 1976. He served as chancellor of York University from 1977 to 1982.

Robarts and his wife divorced in the early seventies, and he remarried to a woman 28 years his junior.

Robarts died by suicide on October 18, 1982. He had been suffering from depression as a result of the 1977 suicide of his son, Timothy, and a series of debilitating strokes.

He was given a state funeral at St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church in Toronto. He is buried in St. James Cemetery.

==Legacy==
The Robarts Centre for Canadian Studies at York University was founded in 1984 in his name. The John P. Robarts Research Institute (renamed The Robarts Research Institute in 2005) at the University of Western Ontario was officially opened in 1986. Also in London is the Robarts School for the Deaf, and the John P. Robarts elementary school. The 16-storey John P. Robarts Research Library at the University of Toronto is also named in his honour.

==Biographies==
University of Western Ontario professor A. K. McDougall authored the first full-length biography: &quot;Robarts&quot;, in 1985. Steve Paikin wrote a biography, &quot;Public Triumph, Private Tragedy: The Double Life of John P. Robarts&quot; (Viking, 2005).

===Native American raids===
On March 28, 1780, John Rogers and Asa Upson were producing sugar a short distance above the mouth of Hunlock Creek, when they were suddenly surrounded and captured by Native Americans. Upson was killed and Rogers was carried off. The attackers then proceeded to where Abram Pike was making sugar (near the modern-day Village of Pikes Creek); they captured Pike and his wife.

The following day, the Native Americans advanced on the Village of Orange, where they captured Moses Van Campen, his father, and Peter Pence. The captors killed Moses’ father. They transported the prisoners to the mouth of Wysox Creek, where John Rogers managed to steal a knife from one of the Native Americans; he cut his fellow prisoners loose.

<text>Nanticoke is a city in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 10,628, making it the third largest city in Luzerne County. It occupies of land. Nanticoke is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania.

The city can be divided into several sections: Honey Pot (northwestern Nanticoke), (northern and central Nanticoke), and Hanover Section (southeastern Nanticoke). It was once an active coal mining community. Today, the 167-acre main campus of Luzerne County Community College is located within the city.

==History==
===Early history===
The name &quot;Nanticoke&quot; was derived from Nentego (&quot;tidewater people&quot;), an Algonquian-speaking Native American people who moved to the Wyoming Valley when their Chesapeake Bay homelands were spoiled for hunting by the European settlers. For quite some time, the tribe maintained a village in the valley before Europeans settled there. The nearby Nanticoke Creek, also named after the tribe, was once known as Muddy Run. However, its current name was appearing on maps as early as 1776. The creek has also historically been referred to by many other names, including Lee&#x27;s Creek, Miller&#x27;s Creek, Robbins Creek, Bobbs Creek, Rummage Creek, and Warrior Run Creek. All of these names were described as erroneous in Henry C. Bradsby&#x27;s 1893 book &quot;History of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania&quot;.

A forge was constructed on Nanticoke Creek in 1778 by Mason F. Alden and John Alden. During that same year, a log gristmill was also built near the creek by a Mr. Chapman. The mill was heavily guarded in 1780. By 1793, a sawmill and gristmill both existed on the creek.

===Incorporation===

In the 19th century, Nanticoke was carved out of Hanover Township and Newport Township. The settlement was incorporated as a village in 1830; Nanticoke was chartered by the Pennsylvania Legislature as a borough on January 31, 1874. Nanticoke experienced its greatest population increase between 1917 and 1925. This allowed for it to qualify as a third class city.

The citizens voted in the fall of 1924 to form a city government; and elections were held the following year. The new city government consisted of a mayor and several councilmen, who took office in January 1926 (which was the official date of becoming a third class city). The first mayor of Nanticoke City was Dan Sakowski.

===Post-incorporation===
Samuel H. Kress opened his first store, which grew into the national S. H. Kress &amp; Co. chain, in Nanticoke.

The city gained prominence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as an active anthracite coal mining community, drawing a large portion of its labor force from European immigrants. At its peak, in the 1930s, the city was home to over 27,000 people. However, when the mining industry in the region collapsed, Nanticoke witnessed urban decay and a shrinking population. The collapse of the mining industry also left behind a scarred landscape – abandoned mines, breakers, buildings, and pollution in Nanticoke Creek due to mine drainage. Concrete City, built by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad&#x27;s coal division in 1911, is located near the Hanover Section of Nanticoke. Abandoned since 1924, it was designated as an historic site in 1998, and its remnants still stand as a tourist attraction. The original entrance has since been bulldozed. However, there is an alternate route that does not appear on maps; it can be found at the end of Bliss and Mosier Streets.

In 1967, Luzerne County Community College, a two-year community college, was established in the city. Today, the main campus covers roughly 167 acres in Nanticoke. The school also maintains eleven satellite learning centers located throughout Northeastern Pennsylvania.
Nanticoke City officials voted unanimously to apply for Act 47, or economically distressed city status, which was granted by the state in 2006. Nanticoke faced a projected $700,000 deficit that year, with revenues flat and falling far behind expenses.

<text>Nescopeck is a borough in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,480 as of the 2020 census.

In 2011 between the dates of September 6 and September 9, Nescopeck became one of many victims to Tropical Storm Lee. Lower-lying parts of the town that neighbored the Susquehanna River became flooded. One of the buildings that suffered damage was the Cooper House. After sitting for almost eight years, the historical building of 1817 was finally demolished on April 26, 2019.

On August 5, 2022, a fire at a house killed ten people at a home in Nescopeck, including three children. All of the victims were related to a volunteer firefighter who responded to the blaze. Eight days later on August 13, a man drove into a crowd at a fundraiser for the victims in nearby Berwick, killing one person and wounding 17 others. The man then drove to a home in Nescopeck, where he beat his mother to death. He was sentenced to life in prison in 2023.

<text>Newport Township is a township in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of 2020, the population was 4,444. Newport is located on the outskirts of Nanticoke City.

==History==
===Establishment===

Newport was incorporated as a township in 1790. It is one of the original townships in Luzerne County. The municipality derives its name from Newport, Rhode Island. The first settlement in modern-day Newport Township was established by Major Prince Alden in 1772. A few years later, his sons (Mason and John) erected a forge on Nanticoke Creek. One of the first stores in the territory was established by Jacob Ramback; it was constructed on a road between Wanamie and Nanticoke.

Due to the growing coal mining industry in the Wyoming Valley (in the 19th century), farmers were selling large tracts of land to the coal companies. Even sawmills and gristmills were replaced by coal mines. Alden, Glen Lyon, and Wanamie were just a few of the mining villages in the township. Mine shafts and collieries were constructed throughout the territory.

===Boom and bust===
At the beginning of the 20th century, Luzerne County was in the midst of an economic boom. Industry, which included manufacturing and coal mining, drew thousands of immigrants (mostly from Europe) to the region. By the mid-20th century, anthracite production was declining at a fairly steady rate. Consumers were gradually switching from coal to other forms of energy (e.g., oil, gas, and electricity).

The Knox Mine Disaster was the final blow to the industry. On January 22, 1959, the Susquehanna River broke through the River Slope Mine in Port Griffith, Jenkins Township. The incident claimed twelve lives. In the following months, two of the area&#x27;s largest coal companies announced a full withdrawal from the anthracite business. Thousands of jobs were lost and the mining industry never recovered in Luzerne County.

===Contemporary history===
St. Stanislaus Institute, also known as St. Stanislaus Orphanage and Holy Child Church, was built between 1918 and 1939. The facility served as a Catholic orphanage until it closed in 1972. St. Stanislaus was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. The building is now occupied by apartments. Holy Child closed in 2010. A nursing home was built nearby.

<text>Nuangola is a borough in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. The population was 663 as of the 2020 census. Developed as a summer resort in the early 20th century, the borough is built around a heart-shaped lake called Nuangola Lake.

==History==
===Origin of name===
The name &quot;Nuangola&quot; probably derives from an Algonquian language, which was spoken by the indigenous Native Americans of the area (most likely the Delaware (Lenape), the region&#x27;s largest tribe. Some Nanticoke and Shawnee also lived there at the time). According to legend, a Native American maiden named Nuangola is believed to have drowned in the lake. Another account says that Nuangola is a Native American word (probably from an Algonquian language) for &quot;Three-Cornered Lake&quot; or &quot;Triangular Lake.&quot; Early settlers named its this, but the name was changed to Nuangola to avoid confusion with other towns in Pennsylvania. It has also been suggested that &quot;Nuangola&quot; means &quot;people of the north.&quot;

===Incorporation===
Nuangola was incorporated as a borough in 1908. Two years later, in 1910, the population of the new town was just over one hundred people. In the following decades, the population grew. The county became a center of mining and attracted many European immigrants.

But in the 20th century, this area was developed as a summer resort around the lake. Today, over six hundred people reside in Nuangola. Some are retirees; others have second homes here. The population increases in the summer.

===Grove Theatre===
Nuangola is home of the &quot;Grove Theatre.&quot; From the 1930s through the 1950s, it was a popular summer stock playhouse. Kirk Douglas, Joseph Cotten, Jean Kerr, and many other notable actors had early roles there.

After having been closed for decades, the theatre was reopened in 2006 as a Non-Equity stock theatre. Since then, the theatre has produced the following: &quot;Godspell&quot;, &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;, &quot;Plaza Suite&quot;, &quot;Prisoner of Second Avenue&quot;, &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, and many others.

<text>Pittston is a city in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The city lies in the Wyoming Valley on the east side of the Susquehanna River and on the south side of the Lackawanna River. It is approximately midway between Wilkes-Barre and Scranton. Pittston is north of Allentown and northwest of New York City.
The population was 7,591 as of the 2020 census, making it Luzerne County&#x27;s fourth-largest city. At its peak in 1920, the population of Pittston was 18,497. The city consists of three sections: Downtown Pittston in the city&#x27;s center, the Oregon Section in the city&#x27;s southern end, and the Junction in the city&#x27;s northern end. Pittston City is at the heart of the Greater Pittston region, a 65.35 square mile region in Luzerne County. Greater Pittston has a total population of 48,020 as of 2010.

Named after the British statesman William Pitt the Elder, the city was settled around 1770 by the Susquehanna Company of Connecticut. It was originally called &quot;Pittstown.&quot; The city gained prominence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as an active anthracite coal mining city, drawing a large portion of its labor force from European immigrants.

==History==
===American Revolutionary War===

During the Revolutionary War, the Wyoming Valley became a battleground between the British and the Americans. On July 3, 1778, a force of British provincial soldiers, with the assistance of about 500 Iroquois, attacked and killed about 300 Patriot soldiers at the Battle of Wyoming.

A company of militia, led by Captain Jeremiah Blanchard and Lieutenant Timothy Keyes, held and maintained a military fort in Pittston, which was surrendered on July 4, 1778, one day after the Battle of Wyoming, and was later partially burned. In 1780, Pittston Fort was reoccupied, restored and strengthened. From then on it was under patriot control until the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which largely brought the war to an end. A marker stands at the site where the fort once stood.

===Establishment===

In 1853, Pittston broke away from Pittston Township and officially became a borough. John Hosie served as the first burgess of the borough. It was later chartered as a city on December 10, 1894. Thomas J. Maloney served as the city&#x27;s first mayor from 1894 to 1898. Throughout the late 1890s, Pittston&#x27;s borders extended from Scranton to Wilkes-Barre, but due to financial and civil differences, the community was later divided into several townships and boroughs throughout the Greater Pittston.

===Coal mining===
Pittston is located within Pennsylvania&#x27;s Coal Region. The first discovery of the anthracite coal (in the Wyoming Valley) occurred around 1770. The first mine was established in 1775 near Pittston. With the opening of a canal in the 1830s, Pittston became an important link in the coal industry. Money made through the mining and transportation of coal led some of the leading merchants to petition its separation from Pittston Township. The anthracite and railroad industry attracted thousands of immigrants, making Pittston a true melting pot with once-distinct ethnic and class neighborhoods. The population of Pittston boomed in the late 19th century. The boom continued well into the 20th century.

The anthracite coal mining industry, and its extensive use of child labor in the early part of the 20th century, was one of the industries targeted by the National Child Labor Committee and its hired photographer, Lewis Hine. Many of Hine&#x27;s subjects were photographed in the mines and coal fields in and around Pittston between 1908 and 1912. The impact of the Hine photographs led to the enactment of child labor laws across the country.

====Mining disasters====
Coal mining remained the prominent industry in Pittston for many decades, but disasters did strike on more than one occasion. The first major tragedy, the Twin Shaft disaster, occurred at the Newton Coal Company near the city&#x27;s railroad junction. In the early morning hours of June 28, 1896, 90 miners were at work in the Red Ash Vein of the Newton Coal Company&#x27;s Twin Shaft Mine in Pittston when, at 3:00 am, the roof quickly collapsed. The concussion from the explosion was so great that it was heard for miles around. The foundation of nearly every building in Pittston was shaken. The cave-in killed 58 miners, including the city&#x27;s then-acting mayor.

Anthracite coal mining remained a major industry in the Greater Pittston region until the Knox Mine disaster. It essentially killed the industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. On January 22, 1959, the ice-laden Susquehanna River broke through the roof of the River Slope Mine of the Knox Coal Company in nearby Port Griffith (in Jenkins Township). This allowed for billions of gallons of river water to flood the interconnected mines. It took three days to plug the hole in the riverbed, which was done by dumping large railroad cars, smaller mine cars, culm, and other debris into the whirlpool formed by the water draining into the mine.

Sixty-nine miners escaped; twelve miners died and their bodies were never recovered. The heroic efforts of one miner, Myron Thomas of Taylor, led 26 miners to safety. Another group of six men was led by Pacifico &quot;Joe&quot; Stella of Pittston. Amedeo Pancotti was part of the second group, and for his remarkable climb out of the Eagle Air Shaft to the surface; he was later awarded the Carnegie Medal for Heroism from the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission.

At 5:15 pm on November 27, 1942, the cave-in of an anthracite mine, that had not been operated since 1868, caused the earth of a half square mile of Pittston to crack and subside.

The largest crack was &quot;...five feet wide, 150 feet long and so deep the bottom was not visible. Two hundred homes were twisted, cracked or sprung from their foundations. Sidewalks were torn up and gas and water mains snapped in several places. Water cascaded through the streets and flooded cellars.&quot;

&quot;Since 1942 the Pennsylvania DEP [Department of Environmental Protection] and its predecessor, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (PADER), as well as the U.S. Department of the Interior/Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), have investigated 149 mine-related subsidence events in the city.&quot;

===Economic rise and fall===

Pittston became an active railroad center in response to its mining and industrial activity. Lehigh Valley Railroad maintained a station in downtown Pittston, near the foot of the Water Street Bridge. The station did not survive the urban renewal of the 1960s and was demolished in 1964. Pittston also had a station on the historic Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad, commonly known as the Laurel Line.

Besides mining anthracite coal, Pittston was home to many industries in the 19th and 20th centuries, including metals, plastics, paper products, apparel, electrical equipment and beverages. The Pittston Stove Company, established in 1864, manufactured coal and wood-burning stoves for heating and cooking. The Pittston Brewing Company, brewers of Glennon&#x27;s Beer, maintained operations in Pittston from 1873 until 1948. Evan R. Jones Stoneware crafted pottery which bore the Pittston name in the 1870s and 1880s.

From the 1930s to the 1980s, Pittston City emerged as a national center for clothing manufacturing. Thousands of workers, mainly women, labored in many factories throughout the Greater Pittston area. Most were members of the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union (ILGWU). They fought for higher wages, workplace health &amp; safety improvements, and employee rights. The ILGWU was active in civic and political life throughout Pennsylvania.

Main Street was the site of an active downtown into the 1970s, featuring clothing stores, shoe stores, jewelers, JC Penneys, Kresge&#x27;s, Woolworth&#x27;s, drug stores, restaurants, movie theaters, and banks. It was home to at least two theaters, the Roman at 27 South Main and the American at 48 North Main, both of which have been razed. Many historic commercial structures were demolished in the urban renewal efforts of the 1960s. By the late 20th century, most of the city&#x27;s factories were closed and shipped overseas. Stores throughout the downtown closed and boarded up over this period. Pittston, like most Rust Belt cities, also witnessed population loss and urban decay.

On March 15, 1993, two Pittston firefighters, John Lombardo and Len Insalaco, were killed while fighting a blaze on the city&#x27;s main street. A monument was built in the downtown and the nearby Water Street Bridge was renamed to commemorate their sacrifice during that tragic March day.

===21st century===
For decades, the towering spires of the many Protestant and Catholic churches dominated the city&#x27;s skyline. Most of the numerous Catholic churches were established to serve one of the many ethnic communities that made up Pittston. The Irish had St. John the Evangelist and St. Mary Help of Christians, the Slovaks had St. John the Baptist, the Lithuanians had St. Casimir&#x27;s, the Germans had St. Mary Assumption, and the Italians had St. Rocco&#x27;s and Our Lady of Mount Carmel. There is also a Carpatho-Rusyn Byzantine Catholic Church, St. Michael&#x27;s, on Main Street. From 2004 to the present, the Diocese of Scranton has closed many of the churches and private schools in and around Pittston due to declining population and enrollment. Saint John the Baptist Elementary School closed in 2004, and Seton Catholic High School closed in 2007. St. Mary&#x27;s Assumption School closed in 2011.

In 2009, Mayor Joseph P. Keating resigned after losing his bid for re-nomination. The city council appointed the first female mayor in the city&#x27;s history (Donna McFadden-Connors) to serve out the remainder of Keating&#x27;s term. She was later succeeded in 2010 by the youngest mayor in the city&#x27;s history (Jason C. Klush).

Pittston is currently undergoing an economic revitalization since the start of its industrial decline decades ago. The downtown area was renovated with new sidewalks, trees, and street lights. Older buildings are being demolished and newer structures, including condominiums, restaurants, bars, and stores are being built.

==Downtown renovation==

In October 2005, Daniel Siniawa and Associates of Dickson City, Pennsylvania, designed a condo complex for Pittston City, located at Kennedy Boulevard between the Water Street Bridge and East Street. Riverfront Park is located to the west of the development. After a number of years, the condos were constructed and opened to the public.

In December 2009, several buildings along William Street were demolished. These included St. John the Baptist Church and School, St. John the Baptist Catholic Information Library, St. John the Baptist Rectory, the Msgr. Joseph A. Super Athletic Center, and Dave&#x27;s Billiards. The only building remaining is part of the school where DeMuro&#x27;s Pizzeria is now located. A memorial green place now sits where the rest of the school once stood. A monument was also built to commemorate both the school and the church, which served the Slovak community for over a century.

In 2008, under the leadership of Mayor Joseph P. Keating, the city invested in renovating the downtown area sidewalks with a brick theme. Colorful brick pavers line the sidewalks along the curbside and at street crossings. Black street lights and sign posts were also placed to enhance the appearance of the downtown. Trees were also planted throughout the central business district. Since 2008, more downtown restoration has occurred. Older buildings are being demolished and newer structures (i.e., condominiums, restaurants, bars, and stores) are being built. Pittston Parks and Recreation Committee proposed an idea in 2015 to paint many of Pittston&#x27;s fire hydrants; it began in 2016. They were painted by various artistically inclined locals.

<text>Pittston Township is a township in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. The population was 3,179 as of the 2020 census. The township is located within the Greater Pittston region. As of 2010, the total population of Greater Pittston was 48,020. The Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport is located in Pittston Township.

==History==
===Establishment=== 
Pittston Township was one of the five original townships formed under the Susquehanna Land Company of Connecticut (in the Wyoming Valley). It was originally known as Pittstown (named for Sir William Pitt, an English statesman). Each township was originally five square miles and divided amongst forty settlers. The township was surveyed in 1768. But, in 1784, flood waters destroyed the surveyor&#x27;s marks and an act was passed for a new survey to take place. After being resurveyed, the township grew to nearly thirty-six square miles.

Zebulon Marcy was the first white settler to build a brush (or log) cabin in the township. Some may refer to him as the first settler. The other leading families in the township (prior to and during the American Revolution) were the Blanchards, Browns, Careys, Bennetts, Silsbeys, Marceys, Benedicts, St. Johns, Sawyers, and Coopers. Reverend Benedict was the first preacher in the locality. Captain Jeremiah Blanchard Sr. commanded the Pittston Company.

During the Revolutionary War, British and American forces clashed within the Wyoming Valley. On the morning of July 4, 1778—after the surrender of Forty Fort to the British—British Officer Butler sent a detachment across the river to Pittston and demanded the surrender of Fort Brown, which was commanded by Captain Blanchard. The fort capitulated on fair terms.

The first sawmill in the township was built near the mouth of the Lackawanna in 1780 by Solomon Finn and E. L. Stevens. Dr. Nathaniel Giddings was the first physician in the township. He came from Connecticut in 1787, and practiced medicine in the community until his death in 1851. He also set up one of the first orchards in the township.

===Coal mining===

For sixty years, the Yankee element predominated the population of the township. When coal was discovered, a great migration of various European nationalities began. This influx is responsible for the heterogeneous population found in the township today. The coal interests soon became the largest source of wealth in the township (although there was some valuable farmland in the small valleys). Col. James W. Johnson was one of the pioneers in the mining and shipping of coal. He sent considerable quantities down the river in &quot;arks&quot; when this was the only mode of transportation.

McCarthyville, popularly known as Cork Lane, was once a mining village in Pittston Township. In 1892, the community consisted of 900 inhabitants and 140 dwellings. Browntown, which neighbors Cork Lane, was another mining community in the township. In 1892, it consisted of nearly 1,000 residents and 200 dwellings. Pittston Township remained an active mining community for many decades. However, on January 22, 1959, the Knox Mine Disaster (in nearby Port Griffith) shattered the industry when the Susquehanna River broke through and flooded most of the interconnected mines in the area.

===Airport===

As the United States entered the age of mass air transportation, Scranton and Wilkes-Barre (the largest cities in Northeast Pennsylvania) recognized the need for a large-scale airport. Despite the Great Depression and hard times affecting the local coal mining industry, a windfall multimillion-dollar opportunity to plan and build a regional airport was presented to the counties of Luzerne and Lackawanna through their Public Works Administration. It became apparent that a modern airport would be needed for the economic survival of the region. The site in and around Pittston Township was first surveyed in 1939 by the county commissioners of both counties.

In 1941, John B. McDade, president of the Heidelberg Coal Company and father of Congressman Joseph M. McDade, donated 122 acres on which part of the airport now sits. Most of the land was previously owned by various coal companies. By 1945, the two counties entered into a legal agreement to co-sponsor and operate the airport. Between 1945 and 1947, construction of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport took place in and around Pittston Township. Today, the airport is known as the “Gateway to Northeastern Pennsylvania and the Pocono Mountains.” It is the fifth busiest airport in Pennsylvania.

On April 20, 1985, a CT-39 Sabreliner crashed while attempting to land at the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport; this resulted in the deaths of all five people on board (including General Jerome F. O&#x27;Malley, the commander of Tactical Air Command).

===&quot;Kids for cash&quot; scandal===

The “kids for cash” scandal unfolded in 2008 over judicial kickbacks at the Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas in Wilkes-Barre. Two judges, President Judge Mark Ciavarella and Senior Judge Michael Conahan, were convicted of accepting money from Robert Mericle, builder of two private, for-profit youth centers for the detention of juveniles, in return for contracting with the facilities and imposing harsh adjudications on juveniles brought before their courts to increase the number of residents in the centers. One such center was PA Child Care in Pittston Township.

<text>Plains Township is a township in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States (on the outskirts of Wilkes-Barre). The population was 9,816 at the 2020 census. The municipality is the birthplace of Chicago White Sox hall of famer Ed Walsh and John J. Yeosock, a United States Army general who commanded the 3rd U.S. Army during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. Mohegan Pennsylvania is a casino in Plains Township (located along PA 315).

==History==
===Settlement===
Modern-day Plains Township was originally owned and occupied by the Wanami tribe of the Delaware Native Americans. Jacob was the tribe’s leader; he lived on level ground adjacent to the Susquehanna River (near the modern-day City of Wilkes-Barre). Early white settlers named the locality “Jacob’s Plains.” As time progressed, the settlers simply referred to it as “Plains.”

Roughly two hundred settlers from the Susquehanna Company of Connecticut arrived in Plains in August 1762; they established a small village of cabins just above the mouth of Mill Creek. They returned to New England in November after planting a few acres of wheat. The Susquehanna Company returned with their families, livestock, and provisions in the spring of 1763.

===Massacre of 1763===
During the summer of 1763, the Iroquois and Delaware came together in an attempt to form a relationship. This resulted in a deadly fire which claimed the life of the Delaware chieftain (Teedyuscung). The Iroquois charged the colonists with the crime, and the aggrieved Delaware were determined to resolve the matter. On October 15, 1763, the unsuspecting pioneers were attacked by the Delaware. Twenty or thirty were killed, several were taken prisoner, and those who were not captured fled to the mountains; they had no other choice but to return to New England. The Native Americans finally burned what was left of the English settlement.

===Pennamite-Yankee Wars===

In January 1769, a group of Pennamites (who represented Pennsylvania) took possession of the land once occupied by the Susquehanna Land Company of Connecticut. They were known as the Ogden party; they established a fort in the region. The Connecticut settlers, who learned of the Pennamite occupation of the area, returned in the spring of 1769. This resulted in the Pennamite-Yankee Wars — a struggle between the Pennamites and the Yankees (from Connecticut). After a series of minor skirmishes, the conflict ended with the land being granted to Pennsylvania.

===Township status===

Large amounts of anthracite coal rested underneath Plains. In 1808, Henry Stark of Plains succeeded in burning anthracite coal in a grate. This was the second successful attempt in the region (after Judge Jesse Fell). This resulted in the widespread use of anthracite coal as a fuel source. Throughout the 1800s, canals and railroads were constructed to aid in the mining and transportation of coal. The mining industry in Luzerne County boomed. Farming was a major way of life in Plains prior to the mining industry. Farmland was replaced by great collieries, breakers, canals, and railroads.

As a result of the growing population in Plains, it was officially made a township on November 10, 1851. Plains Township was formed from sections of Wilkes-Barre Township and Pittston Township.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Luzerne County was in the midst of an economic boom. Industry, which included manufacturing and coal mining, drew thousands of immigrants (mostly from Europe) to the region. By the mid-20th century, anthracite production was declining at a fairly steady rate. Consumers were gradually switching from coal to other forms of energy (e.g., oil, gas, and electricity). The Knox Mine Disaster was the final blow to the industry. On January 22, 1959, the Susquehanna River broke through the River Slope Mine in Port Griffith, Jenkins Township (just north of Plains Township). The incident claimed twelve lives. In the following months, two of the area&#x27;s largest coal companies announced a full withdrawal from the anthracite business. Thousands of jobs were lost and the mining industry never recovered in Luzerne County.

In the early 21st century, Mohegan Pennsylvania (along PA 315) became one of Pennsylvania&#x27;s first casinos. The casino features over 2,300 slots, and live tables for blackjack, roulette, and poker. The casino opened in November 2006. In November 2013, Mohegan Sun opened a hotel (which is connected to the casino floor).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.95%, is water. It extends from the Susquehanna River in the northwest to the north slope of Wyoming Mountain in the southeast.

Its villages include Hilldale, Hudson, Llewellyn Corners (also in Bear Creek Township), Midvale, Plains, Plainsville, Port Bowkley, and Westminster.

Plains Township&#x27;s numbered routes include I-81, PA 115, PA 309, and PA 315. I-476 crosses the eastern portion of Plains Township. Main Street and River Street cross the populous northwestern portion of the township between Wilkes-Barre and Jenkins Township. The southern and eastern sections of the municipality are scarcely populated. This region of the township is mostly made up of forested mountains.

<text>Plymouth Township is located in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,712 at the 2020 census.

==History==
===Settlement===
Plymouth Township was formed in December 1768 by the Susquehanna Company of Connecticut; it was one of the five original townships in the Wyoming Valley. Each township was five square miles. It was enlarged in 1790 to include what is now Jackson Township, but reduced in 1844 by the formation of Jackson as a separate township, and in 1877 by the formation of Hunlock Township. Further reductions occurred when Plymouth Borough was incorporated in 1866, and Larksville Borough was incorporated in 1909. The western half of Edwardsville Borough was annexed from Plymouth Township in 1884.

In 1769, the Susquehanna Company of Connecticut allotted lands in Plymouth Township to forty settlers. The growth of the township&#x27;s population was very slow. The first settlements were in and around present-day Plymouth Borough. The township was governed by an elected board of three men. The first mills in Plymouth Township were built in 1780. In 1834, Jameson Harvey built the first schoolhouse in the lower end of the township (near the mouth of Harveys Creek).

===Conflicts===
From 1769 to 1785, the Connecticut settlers in Plymouth were harassed on a regular basis by the Pennamites, Native Americans, and Tories. A series of clashes, which were part of the Revolutionary War and the Pennamite-Yankee Wars, occurred between the multiple parties. During the Revolutionary War, the settlers erected a small fortification on &quot;Garrison Hill,&quot; in the lower portion of modern-day Plymouth Borough. The fort saw action in defending the colonists from Native American raids.

Nearly fifty men from Plymouth took part in the disastrous Battle of Wyoming (in 1778). Many of the men were slain in the fight. The women and children of Plymouth Township fled down the Susquehanna River on the night of the battle. As soon as the British left the region, the settlers moved back to the township. They had to rebuild what was destroyed by the British (Tories) and Native Americans. Native American raids continued well after the battle. On November 17, 1778, John Perkins was killed in the lower end of the township. At least three settlers were killed and one was captured in March 1779. Native American raids like these continued in the coming years. 
In March 1783, a massive ice flood on the Susquehanna River struck Plymouth. Nearly all the buildings on “Garrison Hill” were swept away. Reverend Benjamin Bidlack was carried away with his house. After being tossed around by the current and huge pieces of ice throughout the night, he managed to reach higher ground on the lower end of Shawnee Flats (in Plymouth Township). After the flood, the Pennamites were determined to expel the Connecticut settlers from the territory. The colonists were driven from their homes by soldiers. Several of the Connecticut settlers died along the journey.

This cruel act aroused empathy amongst the people of Pennsylvania in favor of the Connecticut settlers. The authorities of the state directed for the settlers to repossess their lands. The settlers gradually moved back to the Wyoming Valley. However, before reentering the valley, they halted on the mountains overlooking Wilkes-Barre. They sent forward a small group of men to see if it were safe to reenter the valley. Alexander Patterson, the civil magistrate of Wilkes-Barre, detained the men, who were then beaten with iron ramrods. Despite these actions, the settlers proceeded cautiously to their homes. Once the settlers returned home, Patterson&#x27;s men attacked. The skirmish occurred on the western slope of Ross Hill. It&#x27;s believed that at least two settlers were killed in the struggle. The enraged settlers placed themselves under the command of John Franklin to avenge the deaths of their fellow colonists. After marching through the countryside, they successfully cleared the territory of any hostile threats. 
Plunkett&#x27;s Battle occurred along the riverbank of the Susquehanna (above the mouth of Harveys Creek) on December 4, 1785; it was part of the Pennamite-Yankee Wars. Plymouth provided most of the soldiers (who were under the command of Colonel Butler). The number of casualties from the battle are unknown, but it&#x27;s believed that at least three men were killed in the skirmish.

===Coal mining===

About 1806, Abijah Smith came to Plymouth from Derby, Connecticut, intending to mine, ship, and sell coal. Smith and his business partner, Lewis Hepburn, bought a 75-acre plot (called Lots 45 and 46) on the east side of Coal Creek. In the fall of 1807, Smith floated an ark down the Susquehanna River loaded with about fifty tons of anthracite coal; it was shipped to Columbia in Lancaster County. As time progressed, additional coal mines and collieries were constructed throughout the township. Railroads and canals were also constructed to aid in the transportation of coal. Coal mining remained the chief industry in Plymouth Township well into the 20th century.

The Avondale Mine disaster was a massive fire in Avondale, an unincorporated community in Plymouth Township, on September 6, 1869. It caused the death of 110 workers. It started when the wooden lining of the mine shaft caught fire and ignited the coal breaker built directly overhead. The shaft was the only entrance and exit to the mine, and the fire trapped and suffocated 108 of the workers (the other two fatalities were rescuers). It was the greatest mine disaster at that point in Pennsylvania history.

On February 9, 1935, the Glen Alden Coal Company began to dismantle and demolish the Avondale breaker and to close the mine. In 1936, no coal was produced. However, in December 1940, Glen Alden Coal Company resumed mining on a limited scale taking coal to the Lance Breaker to be processed.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.06%, is water. It is drained by the Susquehanna River (which forms its southern border). The township&#x27;s villages include Avondale, Ceasetown (also in Jackson Township), and West Nanticoke. Moon Lake Park is located in the northwestern part of Plymouth Township. Most of the municipality is made up of forested mountains (with very little farmland). 
Its numbered roads are U.S. 11 and PA 29. While U.S. 11 follows the bank of the river, PA 29 comes down from the Back Mountain via Harveys Creek gorge; it links up with U.S. 11 in West Nanticoke. PA 29 then crosses over the river and links up with Hanover Township.

The first recorded white settler in the vicinity of modern-day Rice Township was Conrad Wickeiser in 1798. Samuel B. Stivers and William Vandermark were the first known white settlers in what is now Rice Township. Additional settlers entered the territory and constructed the first houses and sawmills. The first schoolhouse was erected in 1840.

Rice Township was originally part of Hanover and Wright Townships. Hanover was granted to Captain Lazarus Stewart in 1770. On April 12, 1851, Wright Township was formed from a segment of Hanover Township; it was named after the Hon. Hendrick B. Wright of Wilkes-Barre. Rice Township was officially established in 1928 from a piece of Wright Township. In the 1920s and 30s, a major industry in Rice Township was the harvesting of ice, which was sold in both Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton. The ice industry faded with the growing popularity of the electric refrigerator.

<doc id="133092" wikidata="Q1181100" url="?curid=133092" title="Shickshinny, Pennsylvania">
<text>Shickshinny is a borough in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 630 at the 2020 census.

The borough is named after Shickshinny Creek, which runs through the municipality and the surrounding area. According to the book &quot;Indian Villages and Place Names in Pennsylvania&quot; (by Dr. George P. Donehoo), the community&#x27;s name likely means &quot;Fine Stream&quot; in a local Native American language. However, according to the Shickshinny Historical Society, the name &quot;Shickshinny&quot; means &quot;Five Mountains&quot; in a Native American language. Five mountains — Newport, Knob, Lee, River, and Rocky — encircle the creek and borough.

==History==
===Early history===

In 1782, the families of Austin and Crossley were the first white settlers in Shickshinny. The first permanent settler in the area was Lizzie James. At this time, Shickshinny was under the jurisdiction of Connecticut. In 1801, Shadrick Austin bought the of land.

Another known settler in the area was William Koons (in the 1850s). Koons settled one mile outside of Shickshinny (where the Shickshinny Creek Bridge was later erected). The name of the area was changed to Koonsville (where the post office was later built). In 1773, Nathan Beach, also from Connecticut, settled outside of modern-day Shickshinny. The area was named Beach Haven after him.

A farm, which encompassed nearly the entire current-day borough, was established by Matthias Hollenback. By this time, it was under the Pennsylvania claim. The land was later inherited by his daughter, Cist Hollenback, who married Chester Butler. In 1857, upon C. Hollenbeck&#x27;s death, the land was divided and sold to the proprietors of the Shickshinny Company: George W. Search, Lot Search, Nathan Beach Crary, and Nathan Garrison. Walter Garrison bought the corner where the modern-day bank is located. Lot Search held the position of Luzerne County treasurer in 1855 and maintained it for two years.

N. Garrison and Andrew J. Eldon built the first store, located outside the old storehouse, in June 1857. But a few months after the store opened, Eldon fled to China with $3,000 of Garrison&#x27;s money. It was reported that Eldon was lost in a storm at sea and drowned from the weight of gold in his pockets. The business soon closed and was bought by Nathan B. Crary. A drug store opened at the same time. It was run and managed by Stephen Bond.

===Borough===

Shickshinny was incorporated as a borough on November 30, 1861. It gained its independence from Salem Township and Union Township, the majority (two-thirds) being from Union. The first officers were Burgess and Enke. The council was composed of Search, Koons, Crary, Nicely, and Davenport. G. W. Search became the secretary, while Slippy became supervisor. Second was Burgess, third Knor, fourth Youlls, fifth Bear, sixth Post, seventh Hughes, eighth Hartman, and ninth Bulkley.

Many businesses sprung up in the next decade, including a flour mill (set up by G. W. and Lot Search in 1865), a foundry (set up by Jesse Beadle, L. T. Hartman, and Frederick Beach in 1866), and a planing mill (set up by Amos Hess in 1874). Two blacksmith shops were also built and run by Miner Brown and Henry Wagner. The first newspaper in the area, &quot;The Mountain Echo&quot;, was first issued in 1873, established by C. A. Boone and M. E. Walker.

Shickshinny became a central hub for many farmers and businesses. A toll bridge was built in 1865 to Mocanaqua, the first of three up to 1920. An 1877 turnpike was built along the creek, heading towards Huntington Mills (modern-day Route 239).

===Coal mining===

Shickshinny is located at the lower end of the Wyoming Valley Coal Deposit, near a Red Ash vein that runs across the Susquehanna River.

Humphrey Davenport was employed in 1830 to prospect Nathan Beach&#x27;s land. He soon discovered coal on Rocky Mountain. For the next decade, coal was extracted from the mountain by teams of men. Finally in 1840, Beach&#x27;s grandson, Dr. Darwin Crary, invented the first inclined chute, which was used by the coal industry. It sent coal to the canal down the mountain. Two years later, in 1842, James A. Gordon built a plane for Beach and Crary. It ran for several successful years.

The mines were passed over to Truman H. Clark. In 1865, during the last year of the American Civil War, John M. Stackhouse and Matthew Wier purchased the mines. Cyrus Stackhouse bought out Wier&#x27;s stock the following year. Again, in 1869, the mines exchanged hands and were bought by the Paxton Coal Company. The Salem Coal Company was formed four years later. Under their guidance, the mines produced 65,000 tons and employed just short of 200 men and boys.

A nearby mountain — Newport — provided coal as well. It sits on the opposite side of the Susquehanna River and was found to possess superior coal. In 1857, roads and bridges were built to connect the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad, which lay on opposite sides of the river, so as to be able to mine Newport Mountain. Neither the Shickshinny nor Mocanaqua mines are in service today.

==Demographics==
===2000 U.S. Census===
According to the 2000 United States Census, Shickshinny had a population of 959 people, who made up 415 households and 241 families. The borough was 99% white, the remaining 1% were multiracial or unlisted. The population was approximately 47% male and 53% female, with 21% of the population below the age of 18, and 23% over the age of 65. The median age was 40.

<text>Sugarloaf Township, or Sugarloaf for short, is a township that is located in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,879 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==

Present-day Sugarloaf Township was initially part of Newport Township (one of the original townships of Connecticut in Northeastern Pennsylvania). The first colonists established settlements close to the Susquehanna River and the territory that is now the Conyngham Valley remained virtually unchartered for quite some time.

The world first heard of the Conyngham Valley after the Sugarloaf massacre of 1780 in which roughly ten Americans were killed by a group of Native Americans and perhaps a handful of loyalists. After the skirmish, burial parties arrived in the valley to bury the slain soldiers. Settlers were attracted to the region from the stories they heard from those who visited the valley.

It is believed that George Easterday was the first white settler in what is now Sugarloaf Township. Additional colonists followed in Easterday&#x27;s footsteps; they were mostly from Northampton County. In 1792, Nescopeck Township was formed from a section of Newport Township. Sugarloaf Township was finally formed in 1809 from a portion of Nescopeck; it was named after Sugarloaf Mountain (a cone-shaped mountain in the valley). Sugarloaf originally included what is now Black Creek, Hazle, and Butler Townships.

John Cawley built the first sawmill on Nescopeck Creek in 1810. The first gristmills were erected between 1815 and 1820 by Benjamin and George Koening. Stephen Yost built the first steam mill in 1865.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and 0.07% is water. The township is drained by the Susquehanna River. The municipality is in Luzerne County&#x27;s Conyngham Valley.

<text>Swoyersville is a borough in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 5,008 at the 2020 census. Swoyersville is located within the Wyoming Valley West School District.

==History==
The community was originally called &quot;Swoyerville&quot;; it was incorporated as a borough in 1888. The community was named after mine owner John Henry Swoyer. In the 1950s, the town held a special vote on whether to add an &quot;s&quot; to the borough&#x27;s name. The measure passed and the borough became &quot;Swoyersville&quot;.

Coal mining was the chief industry in and around Swoyersville for most of the 19th and 20th centuries. The mines ceased production in the 1950s (after the Knox Mine Disaster). However, work continued at the colliery on Main Street (in Swoyersville) well into the 1960s. In 1972, the town was severely flooded by the Susquehanna River as a result of Hurricane Agnes. At the time, there was great concern that many of the flooded abandoned mine tunnels — running underneath Swoyersville — would cave-in. However, the cave-ins never occurred.

Swoyersville&#x27;s terrain is flat in the south, with the northern part of the borough being hilly. The majority of the borough&#x27;s land is urban, with some forest in the north.

A massive pile of coal ash as high as a 17-story building is in the town, surrounded by homes. The pile is enough to fill 26,000 rail cars, and the mayor Christopher Concert advocates for it to be hauled away, if state and federal funding can be secured, even though he used it for sledding in the winter as a child.

<text>Union Township is a township in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,033 at the 2020 census.

==History==
===Establishment===
Union Township was formed from a piece of Huntington Township in July 1813. The first settlements, outside of what is now Shickshinny, were erected by George Fink and Peter Gregory in 1790. Other settlers, most of whom were from Connecticut, followed in their footsteps. The first sawmills in the territory were later constructed along Shickshinny Creek.

===Koonsville===
Koonsville is a former logging town in Union Township. Most of the white settlers, fearing Iroquois raids, fled their homes after the Battle of Wyoming in 1778. Several white farmers and loggers returned a few years later to rebuild; this included Shadrick Austin, who bought 256 acres (1.04 km2) of land. In 1801, he established the Austin Family Inn. In 1850, William Koons moved into the area and occupied the Austin family Inn. A post office was built the same year. William Koons served as its first postmaster. The community was later given the name Koonsville (in honor of William Koons).

<text>Warrior Run is a borough in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 528 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==

===Early history===
 The first settlers of Warrior Run were Connecticut natives Elisha and Anna Blackman and their young children, Henry and Ebenezer. In 1791, they cleared trees and built a log cabin. For many years after, their land was the only cleared area beyond the Middle Road.

===Coal mining===
Coal mining was the chief industry in the region. In 1864, the Warrior Run Mining Company was organized; it reopened the old Holland and Hillman mine. The company built a breaker at the foot of the mountain; it opened in 1867.

At about the same time, both the Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Nanticoke Branch of the Central Railroad of New Jersey completed their lines through the area, thus making it possible to conveniently mine, transport, and market the area&#x27;s coal. The occupations of the majority of residents were directly associated to mining in some way.
Ultimately, in the 20th century, the coal industry in the region died out.

===Borough===
Warrior Run Mining Village arose on the land owned by the Warrior Run Mining Company. On January 25, 1895, the Borough of Warrior Run was incorporated. Charles Williams was elected the first burgess on February 19.

A lot on Hanover Street was selected for the borough&#x27;s first town hall.

The borough celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1995.

==Geography==
Warrior Run is located at (41.187463, -75.952584) — just southeast of Nanticoke.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all of it land.

It is located on a historical battleground and on mostly fertile soil. The northern and western sections of the community consist mostly of homes and businesses; the southern and eastern areas of the borough are predominantly woodland.

==Demographics==

<text>West Pittston is a borough in the Greater Pittston area of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located on the Susquehanna River (opposite of Pittston City). In 2020, the population was 4,644.

The town once produced mine screens, glass, crackers, and many other goods. West Pittston rose to national attention in September 2011, when catastrophic flooding (caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee) left much of the borough under water.

==History==

West Pittston was settled in the 1770s. On July 1, 1778, during the Revolutionary War, Fort Jenkins (a patriot stockade in present-day West Pittston) surrendered to the British (under Major John Butler). It was later burned to the ground. On July 3, the Battle of Wyoming was fought only several miles outside of West Pittston. It was incorporated as a borough in 1857. The West Pittston Police Department was also established that same year. West Pittston was the home of Company D, 1st Battalion, 109th Infantry Regiment, which is part of the 28th Infantry Division.

Two bridges were constructed over the Susquehanna River connecting Pittston City and West Pittston. In 1914, the Penn Bridge Company constructed the Water Street Bridge. Today, the Water Street Bridge (Firefighters’ Memorial Bridge) is illuminated by fiber-optic cable. The colors of the lights can be changed manually to reflect holidays and local sporting rivalries.

In 1928, a parallel bridge (the Fort Jenkins Bridge) was constructed north of the Water Street Bridge. The Fort Jenkins Bridge, which was later renamed the Dale J. Kridlo Memorial Bridge, is part of U.S. Route 11. U.S. 11 runs through the heart of West Pittston.

In June 1972, Hurricane Agnes was responsible for massive flooding in and around the Greater Pittston area. From 1974 to 1989, alleged ghost hauntings took place in the home of Jack and Janet Smurl in West Pittston; it inspired the 1991 film &quot;The Haunted&quot;.

On September 8, 2011, the Susquehanna River, spurred by heavy rains from Tropical Storm Lee, crested at a record . It flooded more than a quarter of the town. This was considered to be a historic flooding event which displaced thousands of people and caused millions of dollars in damages to businesses and homes. Following record flooding, the non-profit organization West Pittston Tomorrow was founded. Its purpose was to improve the damaged community. It expanded the public library and created community gardens.

<text>White Haven is a borough in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located along the Lehigh River. The population was 1,163 at the 2020 census.

==History==
===Establishment===

White Haven was created in 1824 by industrialist Josiah White. It was incorporated as a borough in 1842.

===Coal mining and railroads===
Early European explorers to the Wyoming Valley encountered a new form of coal, known as anthracite, that was abundant throughout the Coal Region. Anthracite was a valuable commodity without a good use. On February 11, 1808, Wilkes-Barre Judge Jesse Fell created the first iron grate in the valley to successfully burn anthracite. This invention increased the popularity of anthracite as a fuel source. This led to the expansion of the coal industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. 

Throughout the 1800s, canals and railroads were constructed to aid in the mining and transportation of coal. Luzerne County witnessed a population boom with the expansion of the coal mining industry.

The Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company chartered the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad on March 31, 1837, in order to link Wilkes-Barre to White Haven. Construction of the railroad began in 1839 and was completed in the 1840s. The arduous route required the construction of a tunnel and three inclined planes, including Ashley Planes.

With the completion of the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad, the canal industry, which had existed for no more than one generation, faced a rapid extinction. The Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad moved Wyoming Valley anthracite from its various coal fields to White Haven over the Appalachian Mountains that had posed such a challenge to settlers for 150 years prior to the development of these rail lines. 

Once the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad reached White Haven, an extensive transportation network expeditiously and economically delivered the Wyoming Valley&#x27;s anthracite to a waiting market. By 1867, the Lehigh Valley Railroad, which was first established in the Hazleton area&#x27;s coal fields, was linked to Wilkes-Barre, and then in 1869, the Lehigh Valley Railroad was connected to other rail systems in New York state.

==Geography==
White Haven is located at (41.059532, -75.776123). The borough is south of Wilkes-Barre, and west of the I-476 and I-80 interchange. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.12%, is water. White Haven&#x27;s elevation is above sea level.

==Recreation==
Lehigh Gorge State Park, which encompasses the Lehigh River, provides White Haven and the surrounding communities with a plethora of recreational activities. Water released from the Francis E. Walter Dam makes the river deep enough for boating. White water rafting is a very popular recreational activity in the park. Other activities include fishing, hiking, bicycling, sight-seeing, snowmobiling, and much more.

<text>Wyoming is a borough in the Greater Pittston area of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located north of Wilkes-Barre, along the Susquehanna River. The population was 3,097 as of the 2020 census.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Wyoming&quot; derives from the Munsee word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;at the big river flat&quot;. The state of Wyoming is either named after this borough or the surrounding valley.

==History==
===Early history===
By the 1700s, the Wyoming Valley was inhabited by several Native American tribes (including the Susquehannock and the Delaware). In the mid-18th century, Connecticut settlers ventured into the valley. These were the first recorded Europeans in the region. In 1768, the Susquehanna Company of Connecticut devised a plan to divide the Wyoming Valley into five townships. Each township was to be divided amongst forty settlers. Wyoming was originally part of Kingston Township.

===Battle of Wyoming===

On June 30, 1778, Loyalist forces, under the command of Major John Butler, arrived in the Wyoming Valley to attack the American settlements. On July 1, Fort Wintermoot at the north end of the valley surrendered without a shot being fired. The next morning the smaller Fort Jenkins surrendered. Both forts were later burned to the ground.

Meanwhile the Patriot militia assembled at Forty Fort. On July 3, a column of roughly 375 men including a company of soldiers in the Continental Army marched from the fort under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Zebulon Butler and Colonel Nathan Denison. Major Butler&#x27;s Rangers, with the assistance of about 500 Native American allies, ambushed the oncoming Americans. In the end, nearly 300 Patriot soldiers from the Wyoming Valley were killed during the Battle of Wyoming, commonly known as the Wyoming Massacre.

The next day Colonel Denison surrendered Forty Fort along with several other posts. Widespread looting and burning of buildings occurred throughout the Wyoming Valley subsequent to the capitulation, but non-combatants were not harmed. Most of the inhabitants, however, fled across the Pocono Mountains to Stroudsburg and Easton or down the Susquehanna River to Sunbury.

===Wyoming Monument===
Today, in the Borough of Wyoming, a monument constructed in the early 1830s marks the gravesite of the casualties of the battle. An annual observance, sponsored by the Wyoming Commemorative Association, takes place at the obelisk grounds to honor the fallen heroes of this Revolutionary War battle. The monument has also been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Along with the Wyoming Monument, the Luzerne Presbyterial Institute and Swetland Homestead are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Borough of Wyoming===
Wyoming was officially incorporated as a borough in 1885. The Eighth Street Bridge was constructed over the Susquehanna River during the early 20th century; it connected the Borough of Wyoming to Jenkins Township. In 2011, it was demolished and replaced with a new bridge.

The flood of 2011 prompted the evacuation of the Wilkes-Barre Wyoming Valley Airport (in southern Wyoming). The planes were moved to a higher elevation to prevent flood damage; they were relocated to the Wyoming Monument.
==Geography==

Wyoming is located at (41.309346, -75.836849). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and , or 9.26%, is water.

The Borough of Wyoming is a small strip of land on the western bank of the Susquehanna River. The area closest to the river is mostly made up of trees and fertile farmland. Homes and businesses are located further inland. Eighth Street and Wyoming Avenue (U.S. Route 11) run through the heart of the borough. They intersect in the northern half of the community. Many businesses are located along US 11. The Eighth Street Bridge links Wyoming to Jenkins Township, which is on the opposite bank of the Susquehanna River.

A section of the Wilkes-Barre Wyoming Valley Airport is located in southern Wyoming. The airport covers 135 acres (55 ha) at an elevation of 543 feet (166 m). In 2011, the airport had 25,125 aircraft operations (an average of 68 per day). 99.5% was general aviation, while 0.3% was military and 0.2% was air taxi. 51 aircraft were then based at the airport (this consisted of 98% single-engine and 2% multi-engine).

The following communities neighbor Wyoming: West Wyoming Borough (northwest), Exeter Borough (northeast), Jenkins Township (east, southeast), Plains Township (south), and Forty Fort Borough (southwest).

<text>Anthony Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 866 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Anthony Township was formed from part of Lycoming Township on September 7, 1844, by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Lycoming County. It is named in honor of Joseph B. Anthony, who was a judge in Lycoming County at the time.

When colonial settlers first arrived in what is now Anthony Township, they were outside the western boundary of what was then the Province of Pennsylvania. These settlers were not under the jurisdiction or protection of any type from any of the Thirteen Colonies. They became known as the Fair Play Men. These men established their own form of government, known as the &quot;Fair Play System&quot;, with three elected commissioners who ruled on land claims and other issues for the group. In a remarkable coincidence, the Fair Play Men made their own Declaration of Independence from Britain on July 4, 1776, beneath the &quot;Tiadaghton Elm&quot; on the banks of Pine Creek.

A German Baptist congregation was incorporated on February 8, 1879, under the title of the &quot;German Baptist Church of Anthony Township&quot;. It was one of the first German Baptist churches founded in America, along with two other churches in Lycoming County, one on Blooming Grove Road north of Williamsport and the other in Fairfield Township near Montoursville. These churches were more commonly known as the Dunker or Dunkard Churches for their practice of immersing believers three times, once each in the names of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

A spur of the plank road along Larrys Creek was built into Anthony Township, but it is not known how far it extended. (Landis claims it may have run nearly as far north as the covered bridge in Cogan House Township).

==Geography==
Anthony Township is bordered by Cogan House Township to the north, Lycoming Township to the east, Woodward Township to the south and Mifflin Township to the west. By road, Anthony Township is about northwest of Williamsport, northwest of Philadelphia and east-northeast of Pittsburgh.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which , or 0.22%, are water. The northeastern part of the township is drained by Stony Run, an eastward-flowing tributary of Hoaglund Run, which runs east to Lycoming Creek, a southward-flowing tributary of the West Branch of the Susquehanna River. The remainder of the township is drained by direct southward-flowing tributaries of the West Branch: Larrys Creek in the northwest, Pine Run in the southwest, and Quenshukeny Run in the southeast.

<text>Armstrong Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 685 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The first European settlers arrived in Armstrong Township in 1773. Thomas Hartley, Michael Graybill, George Leffler, and John Kern all received warrants for land on February 11, 1773. Hartley then purchased the properties of Graybill, Leffler and Kern on March 31, 1773. This was to avoid a Province of Pennsylvania law that stated that no one man could purchase more than one tract of land. Marcus Huling appears to have been the first permanent settler in Mosquito Valley, which makes up the greatest portion of Armstrong Township. Huling settled in the eastern portion of Mosquito Valley, near where Culbertson&#x27;s Path crossed. Huling and family cleared land and built a cabin, a sawmill, and distillery in 1795. Huling&#x27;s son, Thomas, carried on the family businesses until his death. Although the Hulings were apparently successful businessmen, they never saw fit to settle their debt on the land that they had developed. Upon Thomas Huling&#x27;s death, the land was foreclosed upon and left to be reclaimed by nature until the arrival of German farmers in 1832.

Armstrong Township was formed from part of Clinton Township in 1842. It is named in honor of James Armstrong, a prominent lawyer. The boroughs of South Williamsport and DuBoistown were formed subsequently from it.

Mosquito Valley was cleared by the lumber companies that made nearby Williamsport the &quot;Lumber Capital of the World.&quot; Lumberjacks harvested the old-growth forests of white pine and hemlock. They then floated the logs down Mosquito Run to the sawmills close to the mouth of the creek. Farmers moved into the area and began several successful orchard and dairy operations after the valley was cleared of trees.

Armstrong Township is not limited to Mosquito Valley alone. Bald Eagle Mountain runs through the northernmost portions of it. From this ridge, several mountain streams find their source. The lumber barons from Williamsport flocked to Mosquito Run in the south and western sections of the township and to Hagermans Run in the eastern portion of the township. The barons built summer cottages on both streams, fished for trout in the waters, and built small dams for recreational swimming and ice skating. They also built several trout hatcheries in Mosquito Valley.

The Williamsport Municipal Water Authority saw the value of the fresh water that was in abundant supply in both Mosquito and Hagermans runs. It acquired water rights to the streams and bought up most of the farmland in the southwestern portion of Armstrong Township in the early 1920s as part of its watershed. Visitors to the &quot;water company&quot; lands can see the stone remains of the early settlers homesteads spread throughout the watershed. This mass purchase of farmland in Armstrong County and the ceding of territory to neighboring boroughs has accounted for the steep decline in population since 1890. Mosquito Run and Hagerman&#x27;s Run continue to supply drinking water for Williamsport and surrounding communities.

The water authority built a multimillion-dollar water filtration plant in the 1990s in Mosquito Valley. With the construction of this plant the lands of the water authority were opened as a nature preserve to the general public.

==Geography==
Armstrong Township is bordered by Duboistown, South Williamsport, and the West Branch Susquehanna River to the north (with Williamsport, Loyalsock Township, and Montoursville north of the river), Brady and Clinton townships to the south and east, Washington Township to the south, and Limestone, Bastress and Susquehanna townships to the west.

Bald Eagle Mountain is in the northern part of the township, and the crest of North White Deer Ridge forms the southern border. The two ridges join in the eastern part of the township at an unnamed summit. Mosquito Valley is in the western part of the township, between the two ridges, and Mosquito Creek exits the valley by cutting north through Bald Eagle Mountain and entering Duboistown before reaching the West Branch of the Susquehanna. Hagermans Run is east of the center of the township, with Hagerman Lake, a public water supply, near the run&#x27;s headwaters at the north base of North White Deer Ridge. Like Mosquito Creek, Hagermans Run cuts north through Bald Eagle Mountain, but passes through South Williamsport before reaching the West Branch.

U.S. Route 15 passes through the eastern side of Armstrong Township, leading north to Williamsport and south to Lewisburg. The township is north of Harrisburg, the state capital. Pennsylvania Route 554 runs through the Hagermans Run valley, leading north to South Williamsport and Williamsport, and south over North White Deer Ridge to Elimsport in Washington Township.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Armstrong Township has a total area of . of it are land, and of it (2.98%) are water.

<text>Bastress Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 528 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Bastress Township was formed from part of Susquehanna Township on December 13, 1854, by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Lycoming County. The township is named in honor of Solomon Bastress of Jersey Shore, who was a former member of the legislature and an associate judge.

The first settlers were German Roman Catholic farmers. They migrated to the area beginning in 1837 under the leadership of the Jesuit missionary Father Nicholas Steinbacher. Together they built the first Church of the Immaculate Conception in 1838. The current stone church building was erected in 1860. The parish also established a cemetery and Catholic school soon after the settlement of Bastress. Immaculate Conception parish and school stand today as a reminder of the German Catholic heritage of the residents of Bastress Township.

Bastress has changed very little since its founding. The community is largely rural, and many of the residents are descendants of the first settlers. Since the 1890 census it has grown from a population of 236 to just 574.

Two streams, Big Run in the west and Bender Run in the east, rise in Bastress Township and flow north, cutting through Bald Eagle Mountain to reach the West Branch Susquehanna River. The southernmost part of the township drains south to the Nippenose Valley in Limestone Township, which is drained by Antes Creek, a north-flowing tributary of the West Branch. Bear Pen Hollow is a ravine in the southeast corner of Bastress Township which drains east to Mosquito Creek, which also flows north to the West Branch of the Susquehanna.

<text>Brown Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 92 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Brown Township, named for Major General Jacob Brown of the War of 1812, was formed on May 3, 1815, by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Lycoming County, from parts of Mifflin and Pine townships. Pine Creek and its gorge divide the township nearly in half, and it is the center of history in Brown Township. Pine Creek was a major waterway in the settlement of north-central Pennsylvania and in the lumber era that swept through Pennsylvania in the mid-to-late 19th century. Early pioneers were attracted to its remoteness and abundance of fish and game.

Jacob Lamb, formerly of Milton, was the first documented European descendant to settle in the area. He arrived in late 1794 by paddling with his family and household supplies in ten canoes, up the West Branch Susquehanna River and Pine Creek to the mouth of Slate Run. Here, Lamb built his home. Jacob Lamb also constructed the first saw and gristmills in the area.

Pioneer settler Jacob Tomb and his family established a home, sawmill, and gristmill at the mouth of Slate Run in the 1790s, and others settled nearby along the Pine Creek floodplain. By 1855, the village had a post office, general store, hotel, and two churches.

Driving the local economy toward the end of the century was the James B. Weed and Company hemlock sawmill, which operated in Slate Run from 1886 to 1910 and produced up to 100,000 board feet of lumber a day. After the end of the lumber era, the mill closed, and the village declined in size. However, in the early 21st century, Slate Run still has a general store and post office, and a hotel with a restaurant and bar.

Over the years Brown Township grew slowly, but it never gained a large population. It is largely a remote area, covered with mountains and a thriving second-growth forest. It is popular today with outdoor recreation enthusiasts. The population was 885 by the 1890 census and had declined to 96 people by the 2010 census.

The Bridge in Brown Township was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

==Geography==
Brown Township is in the northwestern corner of the county, bordered by Clinton County to the southwest, Potter County to the west, Tioga County to the north, Pine Township to the east and McHenry Township to the south. Pine Creek Gorge cuts through the township from the northeastern corner to the middle of the southern border. The bottom of the gorge rises from at the southern border to at the northeast, more than below the surface of the Allegheny Plateau, which has summit elevations ranging from on the west side and up to on the east.

Pennsylvania Route 44 crosses the western side of the township, on the surface of the Allegheny Plateau, passing through the small village of Black Forest. It leads southeastward to Jersey Shore in the valley of the West Branch Susquehanna River and northwestward to Coudersport on the Allegheny River. Pennsylvania Route 414 follows Pine Creek through the township, passing through the village of Slate Run in the bottom of the gorge. PA 414 leads northeastward (upstream) to Morris and south (downstream) to PA 44 near Waterville.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.93%, are water. Nearly all of the township drains directly to Pine Creek, which flows south to the West Branch Susquehanna River near Jersey Shore. The far western portion of the township drains west via Baldwin Branch and County Line Creek to Young Womans Creek, which flows southwestward to the West Branch at North Bend. Tiadaghton State Forest occupies much of the township.

<doc id="133111" wikidata="Q834415" url="?curid=133111" title="Bon Jovi (album)">
<text>Bon Jovi is the debut studio album by American rock band Bon Jovi, released on January 23, 1984, by Mercury Records. Produced by Tony Bongiovi and Lance Quinn, it is significant for being the only Bon Jovi album in which a song (&quot;She Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot;) appears that was not written or co-written by a member of the band. The album charted at number 43 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Aside from the hit single &quot;Runaway&quot;, songs from the album were rarely performed live after Bon Jovi released &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; in 1986. However, on the band&#x27;s 2010 Circle Tour, songs including &quot;Roulette&quot;, &quot;Shot Through the Heart&quot; and &quot;Get Ready&quot; were performed. The album was ranked the 11th best rock album of 1984 by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine.

The song &quot;Shot Through the Heart&quot; should not be confused with the much better-known &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot; from &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot;.

On 25 January 2024, the band announced and released the 40th anniversary edition of the album on the same day.

==Background==
In 1980, Jon Bon Jovi (born John Francis Bongiovi) began work at Power Station, a Manhattan recording facility co-founded by his cousin, Tony Bongiovi. Jon made several demos and sent them out to record companies, but failed to make an impact.

In 1982, Jon went to local radio station WAPP 103.5FM &quot;The Apple&quot;. DJ Chip Hobart listened to the demos and loved &quot;Runaway&quot;, deciding to include it on the station&#x27;s compilation album of local homegrown talent. The studio musicians who helped record &quot;Runaway&quot; were known as The All Star Review. They were: guitarist Tim Pierce, keyboardist Roy Bittan, drummer Frankie LaRocka, bass guitarist Hugh McDonald, and additional singers David Grahmme and Mick Seeley (Seeley also composed the distinctive keyboard riff that opens the song). In 1994, McDonald would later replace Alec John Such as Bon Jovi&#x27;s bass guitarist, initially only as a touring and session musician, before becoming a full member in 2016.

The song began to get airplay around New York. Jon signed to Mercury Records, part of the PolyGram company. He wanted a band name and the A&amp;R staff at PolyGram came up with Bon Jovi.

In March 1983, Bon Jovi called David Bryan (then known as Rashbaum), who in turn called bass guitarist Alec John Such and an experienced drummer named Tico Torres. At that time Bon Jovi&#x27;s lead guitarist was Dave Sabo, a childhood friend of Jon&#x27;s who later formed the band Skid Row. Sabo was never intended as a full-time member of the band, and was soon replaced by Richie Sambora.

&quot;We weren&#x27;t a good band&quot;, Bon Jovi said in 2007. &quot;We didn&#x27;t become a good band until the third record, but we had a drummer who could keep time, which you should never take for granted. But I did okay for a 22-year-old. I&#x27;d only been in a studio for three years total prior to that record and I didn&#x27;t know anything about comping a vocal – where you take a word or a line from one track and piece it together. I was thinking, My God, I&#x27;m so bad that they have to put my vocals together for me. The engineer was saying, Don&#x27;t fret, Jon: even Freddie Mercury and the greats have to comp a vocal.&quot;

==Release and reception==
AllMusic has retrospectively rated &quot;Bon Jovi&quot; three-and-a-half out of five stars. Leslie Mathew, who reviewed the album, said: &quot;The songs may be simple and the writing prone to all clichés of the form, but the album boasts a pretty consistent hard rock attack, passionate playing, and a keen sense of melody&quot;, and called the album &quot;an often-overlooked minor gem from the early days of hair metal&quot;.

<text>Cascade Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 420 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Cascade Township was formed from parts of Hepburn and Plunketts Creek townships on August 9, 1843. It is named for the series of waterfalls or cascades that are abundant in the many mountain streams of Cascade Township.

Many of the early settlers in Cascade Township were Irish Catholics. Under the leadership of Michael Kelly they established the village of Kellyburg in one of the most remote parts of Lycoming County. Michael Kelly also cut a road deep into Cascade Township from a sawmill along Lycoming Creek, and he built a gristmill and a sawmill in the township. Kelly left the area in 1877 following a bitter defeat in the sheriff election of 1872, moving to Kansas and residing there until his 1883 death. Kelly also helped his fellow Catholics establish the mission parish of St. Mary&#x27;s.

==Geography==

<text>Clinton Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,719 at the 2020 census, up from 3,708 in 2010. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Clinton Township was formed from part of Washington Township by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Lycoming County during its December 1825 session. It was named for Governor DeWitt Clinton of New York.

The first permanent settlers to Clinton Township arrived just before the beginning of the American Revolution. They cleared the land that surrounds Black Hole Creek in the valley between Bald Eagle Mountain and Penny Hill. During the war, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Battle of Wyoming in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the &quot;Big Runaway&quot; occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to Muncy, then further south to Sunbury. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the &quot;Little Runaway&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s Expedition helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war.

Following the war the pioneers returned to Clinton Township and reestablished their homesteads. By this time most of the Native Americans had either been killed off or fled to the west. The settlers encountered some struggles over the years, most notably in the winter of 1787. This winter was especially harsh in Clinton Township. Nearly all the livestock was either frozen to death or died of starvation. The supplies of food stored after the harvest were quickly depleted and the people began to starve. Hunters struggled through the deep snow. Even those that were able to use snowshoes to walk on top of the snow struggled to find any game, which also struggled to survive the harsh winter. When the winter finally broke, the residents were able to harvest tremendous amounts of shad in Black Hole Creek and in the West Branch Susquehanna River with a seine that was delivered to them by the father-in-law of Major Ten Brook, Mr. Emmons. Mr. Emmons arrived from New Jersey with additional supplies including salt, wheat, corn, and garden seeds. He is credited with saving the lives of many of the early residents of Clinton Township. Emmons returned again in 1788 with another wagonload of supplies, but while camping he was killed by a tree that fell on the wagon where he was sleeping.

Eagle Grange No. 1 in Clinton Township was organized on March 4, 1871, by a group of rural farmers who had become concerned about the rising costs of farming in the post-Civil War economy. It was the first grange to be organized in Pennsylvania, two years before the formation of the Pennsylvania State Grange and four years after the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, better known as the National Grange, was founded in Fredonia, New York, by Oliver Hudson Kelley. The chief objectives of the Eagle Grange No. 1 were the establishment of a co-operative purchasing program for farmers, the lowering of railroad rates, and the establishment of rural free delivery by the United States Postal Service. The Grange was one of the first national organizations to give equal status to female members.

<text>Cogan House Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 930 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Cogan House Township was formed from parts of Jackson and Mifflin townships on December 6, 1843.

The source of Larrys Creek is in Cogan House Township, just south of the hamlet of Steam Valley. It flows west-southwest through the village of Cogan House, and then under the Cogan House Covered Bridge. The bridge is also known as the &quot;Buckhorn Covered Bridge&quot; (for a nearby mountain and vanished village) or the &quot;Larrys Creek Covered Bridge&quot; (for the creek it crosses). A petition from the citizens of Cogan House Township for a bridge to be built was filed on September 4, 1876. The Burr arch truss bridge was built in 1877 and rehabilitated in 1998, and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Larrys Creek was vitally important to the economic development of Cogan House Township. During the height of the lumber era that swept through Pennsylvania in the mid-to-late 19th century, the creek was used to float logs from the hills of the township to the lumber industry in nearby Williamsport on the West Branch Susquehanna River.

The township is named for David Cogan, a pioneer who settled on Larrys Creek in 1825. Cogan was one of the few settlers in the area for many years, but wearying of his isolation, he left his homestead in 1842, as did a neighbor named Carter. Cogan&#x27;s and Carter&#x27;s houses were used by hunters and travellers. The name &quot;Cogan&#x27;s House&quot; was given to the area and then to the township.

In the spring of 1843, the following men were the first officials named to run the township: Justice of the Peace-Joseph Stryker; Supervisors-John Aikin and G. Botts; School Directors-Joseph Stryker, John Weigel, Benjamin Quimby, Paul Stryker, Charles Straub, and G. Botts. Descendants of some of these men still live in the township.

The area was home to fine timber and an abundance of game in the 1800s. The township became one of the best lumbering districts in the county and soon sawmills began to spring up. James Wood, Isaiah Hayes, F. Whitlock and Mr. Schuyler operated some of the earliest local mills.

The virgin trees that once covered these hills were harvested to feed the lumber mills of Williamsport. However, by the early 1900s only stumps from the giant trees remained. The land no longer held economic interest for the lumber barons. Many of the men who came to work in the woods and at the sawmills had married and created families while living in the township. Some decided to stay on and try their hand at subsistence farming. Slowly, the family farm took root in the sawdust left behind by the woodcutters.

The settlements at Brookside, White Pine, Cogan House, Beech Grove, Green Mountain, Steam Valley and on Buckhorn Mountain took shape. Many grew into villages where a horse could be shod, supplies bought at the general store, mail and newspapers picked up, a vote cast at election time and gossip exchanged. Churches and schools were built to accommodate the spiritual and educational needs of the community.

By 1900 Cogan House Township was home to five churches, five post offices, seven schools, two general stores and a thriving population. During the 20th century this mostly agrarian society was redefined through war, modern transportation, better roads, advanced communication systems, the lure of higher wages in far away places, and the consolidation of schools and churches. The township population decreased to 521 as of the 1970 census and has since climbed back to over 900.

==Geography==

Cogan House Township is in north-central Lycoming County and is bordered by Cummings Townships to the southwest, Pine Township to the northwest, Jackson Township to the north, McIntyre Township to the northeast, Lewis Township to the east, Lycoming Township to the southeast, and Anthony and Mifflin townships to the south. U.S. Route 15, the Appalachian Thruway, crosses the northeastern part of the township, with interchanges at Green Mountain Road and Pennsylvania Route 184. US-15 leads south to Williamsport, the county seat, and north to Mansfield. PA-184 is entirely in the township, leading from US-15 at Steam Valley in the northeast to Pennsylvania Route 287 at Brookside in the west. PA-287 leads north to U.S. Route 6 at Wellsboro and south to U.S. Route 220 at the West Branch Susquehanna River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.10%, are water. Larrys Creek rises near Steam Valley and proceeds southwestward through the township on its journey to the West Branch of the Susquehanna. A number of other streams meander through the township as well. Hoagland Run, in the southeastern part of the township, flows southeastward to Lycoming Creek, another tributary of the West Branch. A few small streams such as Flicks Run and Bear Run in the northwestern part of the township flow northwestward to Pine Creek, yet another West Branch tributary.

<text>Cummings Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 264 at the 2020 census, down from 273 in 2010. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. Cummings Township is home to Little Pine State Park and Upper Pine Bottom State Park.

==History==
Cummings Township was formed in 1832 from parts of Mifflin and Brown townships. It was named for John Cummings, who was an associate judge in the local court system at the time. Early industry in the county included quarries of flag and building stone and lumber.

The Little Pine Creek and Pine Creek valleys in Cummings Township were used by the Iroquois and Algonkian tribes as a hunting ground. Historians believe that there may have been a Shawnee village and burial ground just to the north of Little Pine State Park on Little Pine Creek.

By the mid 19th century the demand for lumber reached the Upper Pine Bottom area, where white pine and hemlock covered the surrounding mountainsides. Lumbermen came and harvested the trees and sent them down Pine Creek to the West Branch Susquehanna River to the Susquehanna Boom and sawmills at Williamsport. James and John English were the first to build a sawmill in the Little Pine area. They built two sawmills in 1809 on Little Pine Creek. In 1816, the village of English Mills sprang up around the two sawmills. The lumber era at Little Pine lasted until 1909, when the last log raft was floated down Little Pine Creek. Remnants of the lumber era can be seen today in and around the park.

Waterville is the most significant population center in Cummings Township. Michael and Henry Wolf arrived in the area from Berks County in 1817. They helped to establish Waterville by building a sawmill and clearing some land for farming. A post office was established in Waterville in 1849. Other early business establishments were two stores and a hotel, which stands today.

Tiadaghton State Forest lands were acquired by the state by the early 1900s. The site which became the Upper Pine Bottom State Park was the &quot;Upper Pine Bottom Class B Public Campground&quot; by 1924 (Class B Public Campgrounds were on secondary highways and had a lean-to shelter for camping). During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps built a pavilion at the site in 1936, but it is no longer extant. The park was not officially transferred from the Bureau of Forests to State Parks until 1962.

==Geography==
Cummings Township is in western Lycoming County and is bordered by Gallagher Township in Clinton County to the west, McHenry Township to the northwest, Pine Township to the north, Cogan House Township to the northeast, Mifflin Township to the east, and Watson Township to the south.

Pennsylvania Route 44 passes through the western part of the township, following Pine Creek south from Waterville and the side canyon of Upper Pine Bottom Run west from Waterville. PA 44 leads south to Jersey Shore and northwest to Coudersport. Pennsylvania Route 414 runs north up Pine Creek from Waterville, leading to Slate Run and to Morris.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.81%, are water. The township lies entirely in the Pine Creek drainage basin. Little Pine Creek, one of Pine Creek&#x27;s major tributaries, has its confluence with Pine Creek in the unincorporated village of Waterville.

Cummings Township contains two Pennsylvania state parks. Little Pine State Park is on Little Pine Creek and Pennsylvania Route 4001, northeast of Waterville. Upper Pine Bottom State Park is on Upper Pine Bottom Run and Pennsylvania Route 44, west of Pine Creek and west of Waterville. Portions of Tiadaghton State Forest are also located in the township.

<text>Sarojini Naidu ([[Birth name|née]] Chattopadhyay) (; 13 February 1879 – 2 March 1949) was an Indian political activist and poet who served as the first Governor of United Provinces, after India&#x27;s independence. She played an important role in the Indian independence movement against the British Raj. She was the first Indian woman to be president of the Indian National Congress and appointed governor of a state.

Born in a Bengali family in Hyderabad, Naidu was educated in Madras, London and Cambridge. Following her time in Britain, where she worked as a suffragist, she was drawn to the Congress party&#x27;s struggle for India&#x27;s independence. She became a part of the national movement and became a follower of Mahatma Gandhi and his idea of swaraj (self-rule). She was appointed Congress president in 1925 and, when India achieved its independence, became Governor of the United Provinces in 1947.

Naidu&#x27;s literary work as a poet earned her the nickname the &quot;Nightingale of India&quot; by Gandhi because of the colour, imagery, and lyrical quality of her poetry. Her œuvre includes both children&#x27;s poems and others written on more serious themes including patriotism and tragedy. Published in 1912, &quot;In the Bazaars of Hyderabad&quot; remains one of her most popular poems.

== Personal life ==
Sarojini Naidu was born in Hyderabad on 13 February 1879 to Aghorenath Chattopadhyay. Her father was from Brahmangaon, Bikrampur, Dhaka, Bengal (now in Bangladesh). Her father was a Bengali Hindu and the principal of Nizam College. He held a doctorate of Science from Edinburgh University. Her mother wrote poetry in Bengali.
She was the eldest of the eight siblings. Her brother Virendranath Chattopadhyay was a revolutionary, and another brother Harindranath was a poet, a dramatist, and an actor. Their family was well-regarded in Hyderabad.

=== Education ===

Sarojini Naidu passed her matriculation examination to qualify for university study, earning the highest rank, in 1891, when she was twelve. From 1895 to 1898 she studied in England, at King&#x27;s College, London and then Girton College, Cambridge, with a scholarship from the Nizam of Hyderabad. In England, she met artists from the Aesthetic and Decadent movements.

=== Marriage ===

Chattopadhyay returned to Hyderabad in 1898. That same year, she married Govindaraju Naidu (Hailing from Machilipatnam, Andhra Pradesh), a doctor whom she met during her stay in England, in an inter-caste marriage which has been called &quot;groundbreaking and scandalous&quot;. Both their families approved their marriage, which was long and harmonious. They had five children. Their daughter Padmaja also joined the Quit India Movement, and she held several governmental positions in independent India.

==Political career==
===Early oratory===
Beginning in 1904, Naidu became an increasingly popular orator, promoting Indian independence and women&#x27;s rights, especially women&#x27;s education. Her oratory often framed arguments following the five-part rhetorical structures of Nyaya reasoning. She addressed the Indian National Congress and the Indian Social Conference in Calcutta in 1906. Her social work for flood relief earned her the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal in 1911, which she later returned in protest over the April 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre. She met Muthulakshmi Reddy in 1909, and in 1914 she met Mahatma Gandhi, whom she credited with inspiring a new commitment to political action. She was the first woman President of the Indian National Congress and first Indian woman to preside over the INC conference .

With Reddy, she helped established the Women&#x27;s Indian Association in 1917. Later that year, Naidu accompanied her colleague Annie Besant, who was the president of Home Rule League and Women&#x27;s Indian Association, to advocate universal suffrage in front of the Joint Select Committee in London, United Kingdom.She also supported the Lucknow Pact, a joint Hindu–Muslim demand for British political reform, at the Madras Special Provincial Council. As a public speaker, Naidu&#x27;s oratory was known for its personality and its incorporation of her poetry.

=== Women&#x27;s movement ===
Naidu utilized her poetry and oratory skills to promote women&#x27;s rights alongside the nationalist movement. In 1902, Naidu entered the world of politics after being urged by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, an important leader of the nationalist movement. In 1906, Naidu spoke to the Social Council of Calcutta in order to advocate for the education of Indian women. In her speech, Naidu stressed that the success of the whole movement relied upon the &quot;woman question&quot;. Naidu claimed that the true &quot;nation-builders&quot; were women, not men, and that without women&#x27;s active cooperation, the nationalist movement would be in vain. Naidu&#x27;s speech argued that Indian nationalism depended on women&#x27;s rights, and that the liberation of India could not be separated from the liberation of women. The women&#x27;s movement developed parallel to the independence movement for this reason.

In 1917, Naidu sponsored the establishment of the Women&#x27;s Indian Association, which finally provided a platform for women to discuss their complaints and demand their rights. That same year, Naidu served as a spokesperson for a delegation of women that met with Edwin Montagu, the Secretary of State for India, and Lord Chelmsford, the Viceroy of India, in order to discuss reforms. The delegation expressed women&#x27;s support for the introduction of self-government in India and demanded that the people of India should be given the right to vote, of which women must be included. The delegation was followed up with public meetings and political conferences supporting the demands, making it a huge success.

In 1918, Naidu moved a resolution on women&#x27;s franchise to the Eighteenth Session of the Bombay Provincial Conference and to the special session of Congress held in Bombay. The purpose of the resolution was to have on record that the Conference was in support of the enfranchisement of women in order to demonstrate to Montagu that the men of India were not opposed to women&#x27;s rights. In her speech at the Conference, Naidu emphasized &quot;the influence of women in bringing about political and spiritual unity&quot; in ancient India. She argued that women had always played an important role in political life in India and that rather than going against tradition, women&#x27;s franchise would simply be giving back what was theirs all along.  

In her speech at the Bombay Special Congress, Naidu claimed that the &quot;right of franchise is a human right and not a monopoly of one sex only.&quot; She demanded the men of India to reflect on their humanity and restore the rights that belonged to women. Throughout the speech, Naidu attempted to alleviate worries by reassuring that women were only asking for the right to vote, not for any special privileges that would interfere with men. In fact, Naidu proposed that women would lay the foundation of nationalism, making women&#x27;s franchise a necessity for the nation. Despite the increasing support of women&#x27;s suffrage in India, which was backed by the Indian National Congress, the Muslim League, and others, the Southborough Franchise Committee, a British committee, decided against granting franchise to women.

The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms had a shocking revelation: although the women&#x27;s delegation appeared successful at the time, the reforms made no mention of women and had completely ignored their demands. In 1919, Naidu, as representative of the WIA, went to plead for the franchise of women before a Joint-Select Committee of Parliament in London. She presented a memorandum to the committee and provided evidence that the women of India were ready for the right to vote. The resulting Government of India Act of 1919, however, did not enfranchise Indian women, instead leaving the decision to provincial councils. Between 1921 and 1930, the provincial councils approved of women&#x27;s franchise but with limitations. The number of women actually eligible to vote was very small.  

In the 1920s, Naidu began to focus more on the nationalist movement as a means of achieving both women&#x27;s rights and political independence. Naidu became the first Indian female president of the Indian National Congress in 1925, demonstrating how influential she was as a political voice. By this period, Indian women were starting to get more involved in the movement. Female leaders began to organize nationwide strikes and nonviolent resistance across the country. In 1930, Naidu wrote a pamphlet that would be handed out to women with the goal of bringing them into the political struggle. The pamphlet stated that until recently, women had remained spectators, but now they had to get involved and play an active role. To Naidu, it was women&#x27;s duty to help in the fight against Britain. In this way, Naidu asserted women&#x27;s role as an agent of political change and effectively linked women to the struggle for independence from British rule.

=== Nonviolent resistance ===
Naidu formed close ties with Gandhi, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Rabindranath Tagore and Sarala Devi Chaudhurani. After 1917, she joined Gandhi&#x27;s &quot;satyagraha&quot; movement of nonviolent resistance against British rule. Naidu went to London in 1919 as a part of the All India Home Rule League as a part of her continued efforts to advocate for independence from British rule. The next year, she participated in the non-cooperation movement in India.
In 1924, Naidu represented the Indian National Congress at the East African Indian National Congress. In 1925, Naidu was the first Indian female president of the Indian National Congress. In 1927, Naidu was a founding member of the All India Women&#x27;s Conference. In 1928, she travelled in the United States to promote nonviolent resistance. Naidu also presided over East African and Indian Congress&#x27; 1929 session in South Africa.

In 1930, Gandhi initially did not want to permit women to join the Salt March, because it would be physically demanding with a high risk of arrest. Naidu and other female activists, including Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay and Khurshed Naoroji, persuaded him otherwise, and joined the march. When Gandhi was arrested on 6 April 1930, he appointed Naidu as the new leader of the campaign.

The Indian National Congress decided to stay away from the First Round Table Conference that took place in London owing to the arrests. In 1931, however, Naidu and other leaders of the Congress Party participated in the Second Round Table Conference headed by Viceroy Lord Irwin in the wake of the Gandhi-Irwin pact. Naidu was jailed by the British in 1932.

The British jailed Naidu again in 1942 for her participation in the Quit India Movement. She was imprisoned for 21 months.

===Governor of United Provinces===
Following India&#x27;s independence from the British rule in 1947, Naidu was appointed the governor of the United Provinces (present-day Uttar Pradesh), making her India&#x27;s first woman governor. She remained in office until her death in March 1949 (aged 70).

==Writing career==
Naidu began writing at the age of 12. Her play, &quot;Maher Muneer&quot;, written in Persian, impressed the Nizam of Kingdom of Hyderabad.

Naidu&#x27;s poetry was written in English and usually took the form of lyric poetry in the tradition of British Romanticism, which she was sometimes challenged to reconcile with her Indian nationalist politics. She was known for her vivid use of rich sensory images in her writing, and for her lush depictions of India. She was well-regarded as a poet, considered the &quot;Indian Yeats&quot;.

Her first book of poems was published in London in 1905, titled &quot;The Golden Threshold&quot;. The publication was suggested by Edmund Gosse, and bore an introduction by Arthur Symons. It also included a sketch of Naidu as a teenager, in a ruffled white dress, drawn by John Butler Yeats. Her second and most strongly nationalist book of poems, &quot;The Bird of Time&quot;, was published in 1912. It was published in both London and New York, and includes &quot;In the Bazaars of Hyderabad&quot;. The last book of new poems published in her lifetime, &quot;The Broken Wing&quot; (1917). It includes the poem &quot;The Gift of India&quot;, which exhorted the Indian people to remember the sacrifices of the Indian Army during World War I, which she had previously recited to the Hyderabad Ladies&#x27; War Relief Association in 1915. It also includes &quot;Awake!&quot;, dedicated to Muhammad Ali Jinnah, which she read as the conclusion to a 1915 speech to the Indian National Congress to urge unified Indian action. A collection of all her published poems was printed in New York in 1928. After her death, Naidu&#x27;s unpublished poems were collected in &quot;The Feather of the Dawn&quot; (1961), edited by her daughter Padmaja Naidu&quot;.&quot;

Naidu&#x27;s speeches were first collected and published in January 1918 as &quot;The Speeches and Writings of Sarojini Naidu&quot;, a popular publication which led to an expanded reprint in 1919 and again in 1925.

==Death==
Naidu died of cardiac arrest at 3:30 p.m. (IST) on 2 March 1949 at the Government House in Lucknow. Upon her return from New Delhi on 15 February, she was advised to rest by her doctors, and all official engagements were canceled. Her health deteriorated substantially and bloodletting was performed on the night of 1 March after she complained of severe [headache]. She collapsed following a fit of cough. Naidu was said to have asked the nurse attending to her to sing to her at about 10:40 p.m. (IST) which put her to sleep. She subsequently died, and her last rites were performed at the Gomati River.

== Legacy ==
Naidu is known as &quot;one of India&#x27;s feminist luminaries&quot;. Naidu&#x27;s birthday, 13 February, is celebrated as Women&#x27;s Day to recognise powerful voices of women in India&#x27;s history.

Composer Helen Searles Westbrook (1889–1967) set Naidu&#x27;s text to music in her song &quot;Invincible.&quot;

As a poet, Naidu was known as the &quot;Nightingale of India&quot;. Edmund Gosse called her &quot;the most accomplished living poet in India&quot; in 1919.
Naidu is memorialized in the Golden Threshold, an off-campus annex of University of Hyderabad named for her first collection of poetry. Golden Threshold now houses the Sarojini Naidu School of Arts &amp; Communication in the University of Hyderabad.

Asteroid 5647 Sarojininaidu, discovered by Eleanor Helin at Palomar Observatory in 1990, was named in her memory. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 27 August 2019 ().

In 2014, Google India commemorated Naidu&#x27;s 135th birth anniversary with a Google Doodle.

=== Works about Naidu ===
The first biography of Naidu, &quot;Sarojini Naidu: a Biography&quot; by Padmini Sengupta, was published in 1966. A biography for children, Sarojini Naidu: The Nightingale and The Freedom Fighter, was published by Hachette in 2014.

In 1975, the Government of India Films Division produced a twenty-minute documentary about Naidu&#x27;s life, &quot;Sarojini Naidu – The Nightingale of India&quot;, directed by Bhagwan Das Garga.

In 2020, a biopic was announced, titled &quot;Sarojini&quot;, to be directed by Akash Nayak and Dhiraj Mishra, and starring Dipika Chikhlia as Naidu.

<text>is the second studio album by American rock band Bon Jovi. It was released on March 27, 1985, through Mercury Records. The album&#x27;s title is a reference to the supposed melting point of rock, which is equivalent to 4315.5 °C. In the United States, the Fahrenheit scale is in general use, suggesting the album consists of &quot;American hot rock&quot;. The album&#x27;s artwork introduced the classic 1980s Bon Jovi logo that would later be used on &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot;. &quot;&quot; spent 104 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on February 19, 1987. The singles &quot;Only Lonely&quot; and &quot;In and Out of Love&quot; both charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Background==
Recorded in six weeks between January and March 1985, at the Warehouse Studios in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the album marked the final collaboration between Bon Jovi and producer Lance Quinn. It is the only Bon Jovi album to feature songwriting by four of the band members; &quot;Secret Dreams&quot; is the only Bon Jovi song to date for which drummer Tico Torres receives a writing credit.

While the album has proved a fan favorite, the band was unsatisfied with its sound and essentially disowned it once they had solidified their status as worldwide superstars with &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot;. It is the least represented album in their set lists over the course of the career: nothing from &quot;&quot; was performed after the New Jersey Syndicate Tour, but a few performances of &quot;Tokyo Road&quot; in Japan and Brazil during the 1990s, a few performances of &quot;Only Lonely&quot; during The Circle Tour in 2010, and one performance of &quot;Tokyo Road&quot; in Hawaii, also during The Circle Tour.

&quot;I always overlook the second album,&quot; noted Jon Bon Jovi in 2007. &quot;Always have, always will. We had no time to make it and we didn&#x27;t know who we were... We did whatever producer Lance Quinn said. He was a brilliant guitarist and had made records with Talking Heads, so you listened.&quot;

&quot;All of us were going through tough times on a personal level,&quot; he explained at the time of &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot;″s release. &quot;And the strain told on the music we produced. It wasn&#x27;t a pleasant experience... Lance Quinn wasn&#x27;t the man for us, and that added to the feeling that we were going about it badly. None of us want to live in that mental state ever again. We&#x27;ve put the record behind us, and moved on.&quot;

==Track listing==

*&quot;Tokyo Road&quot; begins with the traditional Japanese folk song &quot;Sakura Sakura&quot;
*Some editions of the album list &quot;To the Fire&quot; as &quot;(I Don&#x27;t Wanna Fall) to the Fire&quot;

<text>Duboistown is a borough in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,198 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Duboistown (pronounced &#x27;doo-BOYS town&#x27;) is named for its founders John and Mathias DuBois who bought of land between 1852 and 1857. The DuBois brothers divided their land into parcels and established the village that bears their name. John DuBois left the West Branch Susquehanna Valley before Duboistown was established as a borough. He sold his business interests and moved west to Clearfield County. He became quite wealthy and the city of DuBois was named in his honor.

The town built by the DuBois brothers and established as a borough in 1878 is by no means the beginning of the history of Duboistown. It is situated at the mouth of Mosquito Run on the banks of the West Branch Susquehanna River. A tribe of Susquehannock Indians had what appears to have been a fairly major settlement at the mouth of the creek. The early European settlers found the remains of an Indian village there. Arhaeologic evidence of earthenware, soapstone ware, pestles, hatchets, ornaments and charms were found on the land that is across the river from Lycoming Creek and near where the Sheshequin Path crossed the river.

The land on which Duboistown is located was first surveyed in 1769. At the time it was known as &quot;Walnut Bottom&quot; for the vast stands of black walnut that covered the alluvial plain on which the borough now stands. Samuel Boone, cousin of Daniel Boone, held the first warrant for land at Walnut Bottom.

Andrew Culbertson was one of the first settlers to have success in the Duboistown area. He purchased several tracts of land beginning in 1773, including the parcel owned by Samuel Boone, near the mouth of Mosquito Run. Culbertson is thought to have moved into the area by crossing an Indian Trail over White Deer Mountain that is now known as Culbertson&#x27;s Path. He built a sawmill at the mouth of the creek soon after moving to the area, and he lived in the area for several years before being forced to flee during the American Revolutionary War, when settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and their Indian allies. After the Battle of Wyoming in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the &quot;Big Runaway&quot; occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Settlers abandoned their homes and fields, drove their livestock south, and towed their possessions on rafts on the river to Sunbury. Their abandoned property was burned by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the &quot;Little Runaway&quot;. Culbertson returned to the area and rebuilt his sawmill. He also built a gristmill, distillery, and a press that extracted nut and linseed oils. His gristmill was especially important to the development of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. It was easily accessible from canoe. Farmers could float their grain in their canoes or other watercraft right up to the mill. Other farmers from the surrounding valleys reached his mill via Culbertson&#x27;s Path. Culbertson saw another business opportunity with the farmers who were coming to his mill. He quickly built a tavern in which the weary farmers could enjoy a drink and get some food while they waited for their grain to be ground into flour. This tavern became a popular destination for the young people of the West Branch Valley. Today Culbertson&#x27;s Mill and tavern are long gone and the area is a largely overgrown riverbank with an abandoned softball field, that is surrounded by a railroad, bridge, and woods.

The 200 block of Summer Street in Duboistown is decorated for Christmas each December and is known as Candy Cane Lane. In 2007, the mayor of the borough proclaimed the month of &quot;December as Candy Cane Lane month forever more in DuBoistown&quot;.

<text>Eldred Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,996 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area. The unincorporated village of Warrensville is located in Eldred Township.

==History==

===Formation and early settlement===
Eldred Township is one of the smallest townships in Lycoming County. A petition was filed proposing the formation of the new township from Hepburn Township in 1858. The court directed an election to be held at Warrensville on October 12, 1858. The question of division was hotly contested, resulting in 109 votes for to 91 against the proposition. On the November 16, 1858, Judge Jordan made a decree erecting the township, and it was named Eldred, in honor of C. D. Eldred, who was then an associate on the bench.

The first white settlers in Eldred Township were mostly Quakers, attracted by the land speculations of Robert Morris, and others in Muncy Township. Among these settlers were the Winners, Wilsons, and Marshalls. The neighborhood of their settlement is now known by the title of &quot;Quaker Hill&quot;.

In 1892, in the northern part of the township, David Kiess &amp; Brother owned and ran a sawmill. J. W. Milnor Sr. also had one in the same section, and in the southeastern part of the township there was one run by C. D. Heim. All these mills were located on and fed by Mill Creek. There were two gristmills in Warrensville: one, owned by J. K. Crawford, was run by water; the other, owned by C. Aderhold, had steam and water both.

===Warrensville===
Warrensville is the only village in the township. In 1842, when there was talk of applying for a post office, several persons met in the store of John Hoffman, on Mill Creek, and the question of a name came up. &quot;Warrensville&quot;, in honor of General Joseph Warren, was proposed, while others suggested &quot;Livingston&quot;. A vote was taken and Warrensville carried. The post office was established July 25, 1842, named Warrensville, and Samuel Torbert was appointed postmaster.

The land on which Warrensville stands was cleared in 1802 by Samuel Carpenter. He erected a grist and saw mill and carding machine, which were the first improvements of the kind in the settlement. They proved of great service to the early settlers. These original works have long since passed out of existence. The village of Warrensville was laid out in 1841 by John Weisel, but never has been incorporated.

In 1892 it contained two stores and one Temperance Hotel, kept by Isaac M. Else, as well as a tannery, carried on by E. W. Lundy, two wagon makers and two blacksmith shops.

<text>Fairfield Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,833 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The exact date of the formation of Fairfield Township is not known, but court records point to sometime between August 1825 and December 1826. A petition for the division of Muncy Township was read in court in August 1825. Historical records do not record when the township was formed, but court documents cite Fairfield Township as the residence of a defendant in a lawsuit in a Columbia County court session in 1826.

John Andrew Shulze retired to Fairfield Township following his 1823–1829 term as governor of Pennsylvania. Shulze bought in western Fairfield Township, now part of Montoursville, for $12,000. His plan was to spend his retirement farming in the West Branch Susquehanna Valley. Shulze quickly made am impact in Fairfield Township. He built a brick house on his farm and donated an acre of land for the construction of Union Church, which was shared by the Lutheran and Presbyterian congregations of Montoursville and Fairfield Township. Ultimately Shulze&#x27;s time in Fairfield Township can be described as a sad failure. His repeated attempts at farming were unsuccessful. He also lost a lawsuit filed by William Cameron of Lewisburg for $3,835.49. Shulze was apparently unable to pay the suit, and his property was seized and sold to pay his debt. Governor Shulze then took up residence in Montoursville, lost even more lawsuits and eventually moved to Lancaster in 1846, where he lived until his death in 1852. As of 2007, Schulze&#x27;s Montoursville home is the &quot;Governor Schulze House&quot; bed and breakfast.

Fairfield Township&#x27;s population has grown since the 1890 census when 468 residents were counted. The census of 2010 counted 2,792 residents. Fairfield Township has many residential neighborhoods that are contiguous with the neighboring borough of Montoursville.

<text>Franklin Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 901 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Franklin Township, named for Benjamin Franklin, was formed from part of Moreland Township in 1822. It included what is now Jordan Township until that was formed 32 years later. Another portion of Franklin Township was cut away in 1828 to form Penn Township.

The earliest settlers to Franklin Township were farmers. They arrived in the early 19th century and cleared the hills and valleys. Many of the farms established by these early settlers are still thriving today. Other important business ventures in Franklin Township included a large tannery on Little Muncy Creek just south of Lairdsville and the lumber industry which swept throughout north central Pennsylvania during the mid-to-late 19th century. Thousands of acres of old-growth forests were stripped to the ground. The logs were floated down the streams to one of the many sawmills that were spread along the banks of Little Muncy Creek. Today the forests of Franklin Township have regrown, providing an excellent habitat for white-tailed deer, black bear and turkey.

Enos Hawley, born in Chester County, was one of the first citizens in Lycoming County publicly to state an opposition to slavery. He was a member of the Religious Society of Friends. The Quakers were firmly against slavery and were noted for the assistance they provided the abolitionist movement in the years preceding the Civil War. Hawley was raised in Franklin Township in the vicinity of Lairdsville, which is the only village in the township. Hawley went on to serve as postmaster in the nearby borough of Muncy.

<text>Gamble Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 780 at the 2020 census, up from 756 in 2010. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Gamble Township was formed from parts of Lewis and Cascade townships on January 30, 1875. An election of the citizens of the proposed township was 152–0 in favor of its creation. The drive for the formation of Gamble Township was led Ira Parker, Abraham Swartz, and J.C. Green. They started a petition and gathered the necessary signatures. Their petition was presented to Judge James Gamble who authorized the election. The results of the balloting were certified by Judge Huston Hepburn. The township is named for the judge who ordered the election.

The first settler in Gamble Township was John Rose, for whom Rose Valley is named. Rose was born in Scotland in 1772. He migrated to the United States in 1794 and settled in what is now Gamble Township. Rose was accompanied to the valley by his first wife and a man named Andrew Tulloh. Rose and Tulloh cleared some land for farming but did not remain in the valley. They both moved to Williamsport in their later years. The departure of John Rose did not bring about the end of agricultural development in Gamble Township. New settlers, a majority of them Germans, continued to clear Rose Valley. Here they established dairy farms and orchards, some of which are thriving today.

Salt mining and the lumbering were the primary industries found in Gamble Township during the mid-to-late 19th century. Several salt mines were built within the township. Thousands of acres of old-growth forest were cleared to meet the demands for lumber during the lumber era that swept throughout Pennsylvania. Williamsport, which is just south of Gamble Township, was known at the &quot;Lumber Capital of the World&quot;.

Today Gamble Township is a largely rural area with scattered dairy farms, orchards, and family homes. The population in 2010 was nearly the same as it was at the 1890 census, when the count stood at 754.

==Geography==
Gamble Township is northeast of the center of Lycoming County and is bordered by Lewis Township to the northwest, Cascade Township to the north, Plunketts Creek Township to the east and southeast, Eldred Township to the south, and Hepburn Township to the southwest. The township is from northeast of Williamsport, the county seat.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.78%, are water. Loyalsock Creek, a southwestward-flowing tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River, forms the southeastern border of the township. Wallis Run flows through the center of the township, first westward then south, to join the Loyalsock near the southern border of the township. The northwestern edge of the township drains by small streams to Lycoming Creek, another tributary of the West Branch of the Susquehanna.

Rose Valley Lake is a reservoir that covers in Gamble Township. Its outlet is Mill Creek, which flows south to join Loyalsock Creek near Montoursville. The fish and waters of the lake are managed by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The lake is owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Its primary use is recreational game fishing. The lake is open for recreational fishing on a year-round basis. Ice fishing is permitted, but the thickness of the ice is not monitored by the Fish Commission. The most common game species of fish in the lake are: largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, muskellunge, yellow perch, chain pickerel, pumpkinseed and walleye. The lake is east of U.S. Route 15 and Pennsylvania Route 14. It can be reached by taking Trout Run Mountain Road to Rose Valley Mountain Road.

<text>Hepburn Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,579 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Hepburn Township was formed from part of Loyalsock Township in 1804. It is named for William Hepburn, a former state senator and one of the founding fathers of Lycoming County and Williamsport, the county&#x27;s largest city. Hepburn Township was originally much larger in size than it is today. Lewis, Gamble, Eldred, and Cascade townships all are formed from territory that was once part of Hepburn Township.

An Indian village known as Eeltown played a prominent role in the early history of what is now Hepburn Township. This village located on Lycoming Creek near the present village of Hepburnville was an important village on the Sheshequin Path. The Indian name for Eeltown is unknown, but the whites named it for the plentiful eels that could be found in the waters of Lycoming Creek.

Hepburn Township was settled by three distinct groups of European migrants. The western section along Lycoming Creek was largely settled by the Scots-Irish, the middle section known as Blooming Grove was settled by a German religious group, the Dunkard Brethren, and the eastern section of the township was settled by the Quakers. John and Gottlieb Heim were among the first Dunkards to settle in Hepburn Township. The Heims were imprisoned in Württemberg, Germany, as conscientious objectors. A condition of their release from prison was that they would agree to leave Germany forever. Upon their release John and Gottleig moved to the United States. They settled in Lycoming County and founded a religious community and village known as Blooming Grove. Soon other Dunkards from Germany joined the Heim brothers. They built log cabins and quickly cleared the land for farming. In addition to clearing the land, the Dunkards were also free to worship God in a manner that they saw fit. Their faith was banned in Germany. The newly arrived settlers worked hard to clear the land and credited their success on their faith in God. The new farms prospered almost immediately; they &quot;bloomed like flowers&quot;, hence the name &quot;Blooming Grove&quot;.

Balls Mills is a village in Hepburn Township. It is named for John Ball who migrated from England to the United States in 1893. He settled in Hillsgrove Township in Sullivan County. There he built a sawmill and was beginning to have success when he drowned while bathing. His son, William, then moved west to Hepburn Township and founded Balls Mills in 1818. He built a fulling mill soon after building his home. The Ball family quickly had success and expanded their milling operations to include a clover mill. The machinery at the clover mill was able to clean clover seed. Clover seed was very expensive at the time; a bushel of the seed sold for as much as $24.00. Clover was very important to farmers for providing ground cover and as a food supply for their grazing dairy cows. The Ball family also built a sawmill, a woolen mill, and a grain cradle manufacturing operation. A cradle is attached to a scythe to gather the harvested grains. The cradles were sold not just in Lycoming County but throughout the United States. The first major shipment to the West arrived in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1866.

<text>Jackson Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 394 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The unincorporated village of Buttonwood is in the township. In Buttonwood there is a covered bridge over Blockhouse Creek, a tributary of Little Pine Creek.

==History==
Jackson Township was once part of Lycoming Township. At the time Lycoming Township stretched from the West Branch Susquehanna River to the northern border of Lycoming County. The residents of the northern part of the township became dissatisfied with their representation in township matters. Most of the officers of the townships were from the southernmost portions near the river and they tended to forget about their neighbors to the north. The concerned citizens of the northern portions of Lycoming Township petitioned that a township for their interests be formed from Lycoming Township, and the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Lycoming County formed Jackson Township in 1824. The township was named for Andrew Jackson, who was then known as the hero of the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812. He was not to become President until 1829.

Peter Sechrist was one of the first settlers to arrive in Jackson Township. He moved there from Liverpool, Pennsylvania, in 1811. Sechrist cleared the land for a farm and also constructed a saw and gristmill. His mills were the first of their kind in the area, and his child, Daniel, was the first white child born in the area. Other earlier settlers, seeking their fortune, arrived from York County. Two sets of brothers, Jacob and Daniel Beck and George and Daniel Miller, first stopped in Williamsport before moving further to the north. They cleared some dense wilderness and established their homesteads in what is now eastern Jackson Township.

The population of Jackson Township was 619 according to the 1890 census. It has since declined to 396 residents as of the 2010 census. The area is largely mountainous and is covered with a thriving second-growth forest.

The Buttonwood Covered Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

==Geography==
Jackson Township is on the northern edge of Lycoming County and is bordered by Tioga County to the north, McIntyre Township to the east, Cogan House Township to the south, and Pine Township to the west. U.S. Route 15, the Appalachian Thruway, passes through the center of the township, with access from Exit 158 at Buttonwood. US-15 leads north to Mansfield and south to Williamsport, the Lycoming county seat. Pennsylvania Route 284 runs west from US-15 down the valley of Blockhouse Creek and Little Pine Creek to Pennsylvania Route 287 in Pine Township.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.26%, are water. Blockhouse Creek drains the center of the township, flowing southwestward to Little Pine Creek and thence Pine Creek, leading to the West Branch Susquehanna River at Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania. Blacks Creek, another tributary of Little Pine Creek, drains the northwest corner of the township. The eastern part of the township is drained by tributaries of Lycoming Creek, another tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna: Grays Run in the southeast, and Roaring Branch in the northeast.

<text>Jersey Shore is a borough in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is on the West Branch Susquehanna River, west by south of Williamsport. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. In the past, Jersey Shore held farms, railroad shops, cigar factories, a foundry, and a large silk mill. The population was 4,158 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Jersey Shore was incorporated as a borough on March 15, 1826. The history of Jersey Shore begins about 50 years before it was incorporated and on the opposite bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River in what is now Nippenose Township. Colonel John Henry Antes arrived in 1772 and established a homestead along the banks of Antes Creek. Antes also built a gristmill and his fortified home, Fort Antes, provided a safe haven for the early settlers against raids conducted by Loyalist and Indian forces during the American Revolution. Settlers who had sought refuge at Fort Antes and had returned to the right bank of the West Branch to milk their cows were among the first killed when Fort Antes was attacked just prior to the Big Runaway. These pioneers on the north side of the river were counted among the Fair Play Men, a group of squatters who lived outside the jurisdiction of the colonial and revolutionary governments of Pennsylvania. Many of the settlers did not return to the area until after Sullivan&#x27;s Expedition had forced the Lenape and other Indians allied with the British further west.

Jersey Shore was originally named Waynesburg by the two brothers, Reuben and Jeremiah Manning, who laid out the town circa 1785. Around the time that this was happening, a settlement arose on the eastern side of the West Branch Susquehanna River (Nippenose Township), opposite Waynesburg. A rivalry developed between the two settlements, and those on the eastern shore began referring to the settlement on the western shore as the &quot;Jersey Shore,&quot; because the Manning family had relocated from New Jersey. The nickname became so fixed that in 1826 the original name of Waynesburg was officially abandoned and changed to Jersey Shore.

Jersey Shore&#x27;s location on the West Branch Susquehanna River, just downstream from the mouth of Pine Creek made it an ideal location for traders and other businessmen who outfitted the pioneers who settled the westernmost portions of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley and the Pine Creek valley. Thomas Martin was a farmer who sold his produce to the people of Jersey Shore and to the men and women who were just passing through. Mr. Martin was noted for his strong beliefs regarding the prices that he set. For example, if he believed that his potatoes were worth 35 cents a bushel, he would sell them for 35 cents a bushel, no more no less. If his competitors would sell potatoes for 50 cents a bushel, Martin would not raise his price and if others lowered the price to 25 cents per bushel, he would not lower his price. This firmness and fairness allowed Thomas Martin to rise to a position of prominence in Jersey Shore and Lycoming County. His reputation for fairness and honesty was passed onto his son Lewis Martin who went on to serve as a Lycoming County prothonotary and as a deputy U.S. Marshal.

The Reverend John Hays Grier arrived in Jersey Shore in 1814. He was a Presbyterian missionary who originally set out from his home of Doylestown Pennsylvania with the intention of serving the pioneers of the west. He stopped one Sunday in Jersey Shore and for the most part never left. He built a strong at Jersey Shore and another upstream on the West Branch in Lock Haven. Grier served the churches in Lock Haven and Jersey Shore for 14 years before serving the church in Jersey Shore, alone, for an additional 23 years. Rev. Grier was also elected sheriff of Lycoming County in 1822.

Jersey Shore was once a major player in the railroad industry. In 1901, the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad announced it would build large rail car shops near Avis, west of Jersey Shore, on the far side of Pine Creek. To induce workers and businesses to favor Jersey Shore over competing towns, entrepreneurs acquired land and built the Jersey Shore Electric Street Railway, a trolley line running from the city to the New York Central shops. In 1905, a second trolley line, the Jersey Shore and Antes Fort Railway, was put into service between the city and the Pennsylvania Railroad station in Antes Fort, to the southeast. These two trolley lines changed Jersey Shore from a city with no railroad connection to a city with two. What had formerly been a minor stop on the West Branch Canal and stagecoach lines was transformed into an industrial boomtown. Over 1,000 skilled mechanics were employed at the car shops. They were able to earn wages that far exceeded the normal income of the average worker in Lycoming County at the time. Other early industrial ventures in Jersey Shore included the American Balance Valve and Machine Works (a maker of railroad valves), the Susquehanna Silk Mill and the Jersey Shore Creamery Company.

On October 10, 1911, Jersey Shore Hospital was founded by four physicians. At that time, the hospital consisted of 14 beds in the rebuilt home of the L.D. Herrit family. Over the next few years, x-ray services, a maternity ward, and nurses’ residence were added. It was not until 1922 that Jersey Shore Hospital was recognized as a community hospital by the borough and became a not-for-profit institution, which the hospital still maintains.

Jersey Shore Steel Company was founded in 1938, near the end of the Great Depression by John A. Schultz. The company began manufacturing steel rails for the railroad industry. In its first year of business Jersey Shore Steel was able to produce 15,000 tons of rail steel. When John A. Schultz died in 1943, the business was passed onto his sons Charles and John A. Jr. The brothers oversaw expansion and devastation. A massive fire nearly destroyed the steel mill in 1963, and the Agnes Flood of 1972 caused tremendous damage. The company, which is owned by a third generation of the Schultz family, operates two mills, the original mill in Jersey Shore and a second mill downstream in Montoursville. It is capable of producing 170,000 tons of rail steel annually.

The Jersey Shore Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

==Industry==
In the past, Jersey Shore held farms, railroad shops, cigar factories, a foundry, and a large silk mill.

Woolrich, Inc. had a mill in Jersey Shore, in addition to ones in the neighbouring towns of Woolrich and Avis, which closed in 2008.

<text>Jordan Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 850 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Jordan Township was formed from the eastern part of Franklin Township on February 7, 1854. It was named in honor of Alexander Jordan, who was president judge of the district court at the time of the formation of the township. The first permanent settler arrived in Jordan Township in 1812. William Lore cleared a parcel of land and established a homestead; others soon followed his footsteps. The lumber industry was very important in Jordan Township for the first 70 years of its history. The hills and valleys were cleared of their old-growth forests by the end of the 19th century. Today much of those forests form a thriving second growth forest.

==Geography==
Jordan Township lies in the easternmost portion of southern Lycoming County and is bordered by Sullivan County to the northeast, Columbia County to the southeast, and Franklin Township to the west. There are three unincorporated communities in Jordan Township: Biggerstown is near the center, Lungerville is in the north, and Unityville is near the southeast border.

Pennsylvania Route 42 passes through Biggerstown and Unityville, leading northwest to U.S. Route 220 at Beech Glen and south to Bloomsburg. PA 118 crosses PA 42 near Biggerstown and leads west to Hughesville and east-northeast to Dallas. PA 239 runs through the northern part of the township, passing through Lungerville. It leads southeastward to Shickshinny on the Susquehanna River and has its northwestern terminus at PA 42 in neighboring Franklin Township. Williamsport, the Lycoming county seat, is west of Jordan Township.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which , or 0.16%, are water. The township is primarily drained by Little Muncy Creek, which has its source in the township&#x27;s northeast corner and flows west to Muncy Creek and then the West Branch of the Susquehanna River at Muncy. The easternmost and southernmost parts of the township are drained by tributaries of Little Fishing Creek, which flows south to Fishing Creek and then to the main stem of the Susquehanna at Bloomsburg.

<text>Lewis Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 987 at the 2010 census, down from 1,139 in 2000. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Lewis Township was formed from part of Hepburn Township in 1835. It is named for Ellis Lewis, who was the president judge of the local district court at the time. The township was expanded on December 10, 1846, when part of Cascade Township was added to Lewis Township. This was done at the request of the residents of the area who were geographically cut off from the rest of Cascade Township.

Lycoming Creek and the Sheshequin Path played an important role in the early history of Lewis Township. The path was a major Native American trail that ran between two Native American villages: &quot;French Margaret&#x27;s Town&quot; on the West Branch Susquehanna River (part of modern-day Williamsport) and &quot;Sheshequin&quot; on the North Branch of the Susquehanna River (modern day Ulster Township in Bradford County). The path ran north and east along Lycoming Creek in Lycoming County and followed much of Towanda Creek in Bradford County. It was a shortcut between the two main branches of the Susquehanna River and was used by early settlers as well as Native Americans.

Lycoming Creek, which begins to the north of Lewis Township in McNett Township, also served as a highway of sorts during the colonial era of Pennsylvania&#x27;s history. The stream was used by early explorers and the Native Americans in the area as a means of travel. They were able to float their canoes down the creek and into the West Branch Susquehanna River. This mode of transportation was considerably faster than walking the path. Conrad Weiser guided Moravian missionaries along the creek and path to reach Onondaga, the capital of the Iroquois Confederacy in 1737. Raiding parties of Indian warriors used the creek and path in 1770 when conducting attacks on the West Branch Susquehanna Valley strongholds of Fort Muncy and Fort Freeland. Colonel Thomas Hartley led the 6th Pennsylvania Regiment up the Sheshequin Path during the American Revolution. Hartley&#x27;s expedition in 1778 preceded the Sullivan Expedition of 1779. Both Hartley and Sullivan were instrumental in claiming the frontier of Pennsylvania and New York for the forces of the Continental Army. As Hartley and his men passed through Lewis Township, the Sheshequin path was widened. The widening of the path helped to open this area to settlement in the years following the Revolution.

Lewis Township was largely uninhabited until after the Revolutionary War. A squatter named A.M. Slack is believed to have been the first permanent settler. He built a cabin and cleared some land in the area that is now the village of Bodines. The village of Trout Run has its beginnings during the construction of the Williamson Road. This road, which stretched from Williamsport to Painted Post, New York, helped open north-central Pennsylvania to settlement. Charles Williamson, the builder of the road, established a supply depot at Trout Run.

Much of Lewis Township is covered with steep slopes that were carved into the Allegheny Plateau by the streams that drain into the West Branch Susquehanna River. The geography of the township has limited its development. The narrow valley of Lycoming Creek is where most of the settlement of Lewis Township has occurred. James Kyle arrived in the area sometime around 1800. He owned along Lycoming Creek. Kyle took out an advertisement in the &quot;Lycoming Gazette&quot;. The ad placed on March 14, 1810, read as follows. 

Kyle&#x27;s farm was eventually sold to Robert Allen. Robert and his family were among the most successful and prominent early settlers. Allen was born in Northumberland on August 6, 1797. His father, John Allen, was a native of County Down, Ulster, and his mother was from Scotland. John Allen moved from Northumberland to a section of land along Lycoming Creek between Cogan Station and Hepburnville in Hepburn Township. He died in 1819 and his farm was divided among his children. Robert Allen sold his share of the farm to his brothers and moved further north along Lycoming Creek and bought the land that was formerly owned by James Kyle. Allen and his wife Mary Ann Hews improved the Kyle farm. They rose to a position of prominence as the owners of an inn that was frequently busy with visitors who were moving along the Williamson Road. Allen was also employed as a surveyor and civil engineer. He spent several years working for the United States government in the Northwest Territory, especially in what is now Michigan along the Detroit River and Lake Huron. Allen died in 1849 and his wife died in 1883. Her parents Henry and Martha Hews were part of the failed &quot;English Settlement&quot; in Pine Township. They had migrated to Pennsylvania from Chard, Somerset, England. After struggling to survive in Pine Township, Henry Hews cleared and established several successful farms in Tioga County and northern Lycoming County before finally settling near Trout Run, where his daughter met and married Robert Allen.

Lewis Township has changed little over the years. The population in 2010 was nearly equivalent to the number in the census of 1890, when it was 985. Trout Run is on U.S. Route 15, which follows the old Williamson Road. This highway is currently part of the Interstate 99 project.

The Bridge in Lewis Township was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

==Geography==
Lewis Township is in north-central Lycoming County and is bordered by Cogan House Township to the west, McIntyre Township to the north, Cascade Township to the northeast, Gamble Township to the southeast, Hepburn Township at the extreme south corner, and Lycoming Township to the southwest. U.S. Route 15, the Appalachian Thruway, passes through the township, following the valley of Lycoming Creek in the south and turning up the side valley of Trout Run to the northwest. US-15 leads south to Williamsport, the Lycoming county seat, and north to Mansfield. Pennsylvania Route 14 leads northeast from Trout Run, continuing up the Lycoming Creek valley to Canton.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.68%, are water. Lycoming Creek runs the length of the township from northeast to southwest on its course to the West Branch Susquehanna River at Williamsport. The Allegheny Plateau rises to elevations of on both sides of the creek, above the valley bottom.

<text>Limestone Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,968 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Limestone Township was established on December 4, 1824, by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Lycoming County. It was formed from parts of Nippenose and Wayne townships. Limestone Township was known as &quot;Adams Township&quot; in honor of United States President John Adams until April 14, 1835, when the name as changed to what was deemed to be a more appropriate title.

Upon arriving in present-day Limestone Township in 1789, the first settlers deemed it barren because the base of valley was covered by thickets of thorny bushes and was largely free of trees. At first the land sold for as little as fifty cents an acre. After the initial settlers cleared the shrubbery and planted wheat, the land was found to be quite fertile, and prices rose to $5.00 per acre. Later settlers to Limestone Township established the communities of Collomsville, Oriole and Oval. These small towns were the locations of small taverns, general stores and sawmills. By the 1890s, land sold for as much as $100 per acre.

Much of the farmland in the southeastern portion of Limestone Township was purchased by the Williamsport Water Authority in the early 1900s as part of its watershed. Visitors to the &quot;water company&quot; lands can see the stone remains of the early settlers homesteads spread throughout the watershed.

The water authority built a multimillion-dollar water filtration plant in the 1990s in Mosquito Valley. With the construction of this plant, the lands of the water authority were opened to the general public as a nature preserve, with limited hunting permitted at certain times of the year.

==Geography==

Limestone Township is in southwestern Lycoming County and is bordered by Washington Township to the southeast, Armstrong Township to the northeast, Bastress and Nippenose townships to the north, and Clinton County to the southwest. The Nippenose Valley (see below) occupies the central part of the township and is ringed by Bald Eagle Mountain to the north, North White Deer Ridge to the south, and unnamed connecting heights to the east. The unincorporated communities of Oriole, Oval, and Collomsville occupy the Limestone Township portion of the valley, with Oriole to the west, Oval in the center, and Collomsville to the east. The community of Rauchtown, mostly in neighboring Clinton County, extends into the westernmost part of Limestone Township.

Pennsylvania Route 44 passes through Oval and Collomsville, leading east-southeast to Allenwood and northwest to Jersey Shore on the West Branch Susquehanna River. PA 654 begins at PA 44 near Collomsville and leads northeast through Bald Eagle Mountain to South Williamsport. PA 880 begins at PA 44 near the northern boundary of the township and leads south and west to Loganton.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.38%, are water. Most of the township drains through the Nippenose Valley to Antes Creek, which flows north through Bald Eagle Mountain to the West Branch Susquehanna River at Antes Fort. The easternmost part of the township is in the Mosquito Valley, which drains northeast via Mosquito Creek to the West Branch at Duboistown.

===Nippenose Valley===
The Nippenose Valley, an anticlinal karst valley, occupies the central and northern parts of Limestone Township and extends west into Crawford Township in Clinton County. The valley is part of the northernmost fold sequence of the Ridge and Valley physiographic province of the Appalachian Mountains. The valley is uniquely bowl-shaped and consists of a doubly plunging anticline. According to a research paper from the University of Akron, the center has been eroded, exposing carbonate rocks in the valley. There is an average total of about of Lower to Middle Ordovician limestone and dolomite underlying the valley. The Reedsville Shale is stratigraphically above them and overlain by the ridge-forming Bald Eagle Sandstone. The valley has been intensely karstified, as evidenced by the numerous sinkholes, springs, caves, and disappearing streams. Rauchtown Creek enters the valley from the southwest and disappears underground in the western part of Limestone Township, reappearing to the north as Antes Creek.

Within a number of caves in this valley a new species of fish, a type of troglomorphic sculpin, was identified in 2003 by Luis Espinasa, an associate professor of biology at Marist College.

<text>Loyalsock Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 11,561 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is the second largest municipality in Lycoming County, in terms of population, behind the county seat, Williamsport.

The township was settled in 1768 and incorporated in 1786. It is located on the north bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River. Native American artifacts can be commonly found in parks near the West Branch. Archaeologists have found over 1,500 pieces of Native American pottery, weaponry and other artifacts, some being displayed in collections in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and New York City. Most can be found at local museums in nearby Williamsport.

==History==

Loyalsock Township was formed from Muncy Township in February 1786 by the Northumberland County court. This was nine years prior to the formation of Lycoming County. The township was originally bounded by the West Branch Susquehanna River to the south, Loyalsock Creek to the east, and Lycoming Creek to the west.
In the American Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley and what was to become Loyalsock Township were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the &quot;Big Runaway&quot; occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled fearing more attacks by the British and their allies. Homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to Muncy, then further south to Sunbury. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the &quot;Little Runaway&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s Expedition helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war.

Isaac and William McKinney, father and son, built the McKinney Iron Works along Lycoming Creek in western Loyalsock Township between 1825 and 1830, when they built a forge, in an area known as Heshbon Park. Their operation was expanded in 1836 with the construction of an iron furnace and further still in 1841 when a rolling mill was added to the complex. Iron ore was transported from Centre County down the West Branch Susquehanna Valley and up Lycoming Creek to the iron works. The McKinneys&#x27; effort was ultimately unsuccessful. The efforts of two more iron masters also failed. The iron works was largely destroyed by a flood in 1865.

Daniel Hughes was a conductor in the Underground Railroad based in Loyalsock Township. He was the owner of a barge on the Pennsylvania Canal and transported lumber from Williamsport down the West Branch and main stem of the Susquehanna River to Havre de Grace, Maryland. Hughes hid runaway slaves in the hold of his barge on his return trip up the Susquehanna to Lycoming County, where he provided shelter on his property near the Loyalsock Township border with Williamsport before they moved further north and to eventual freedom in Canada. Hughes&#x27; home was located in a hollow or small valley in the mountains just north of Williamsport. This hollow is now known as &quot;Freedom Road&quot;, having previously been called &quot;Nigger Hollow&quot;. In response to the actions of concerned African American citizens of Williamsport, the pejorative name was formally changed by the Williamsport City Council in 1936.
Today, the floodplain between Williamsport and Montoursville is densely populated with family residences and a shopping district known as the &quot;Golden Strip&quot; along East Third Street. The northern and western parts of the township are less heavily populated but still there are many family homes and small businesses. The population of Loyalsock Township has grown to 11,026 as of the 2010 census, up from 10,876 at the 2000 census.

The township is bordered by the West Branch of the Susquehanna River and Williamsport to the south (with Armstrong Township south of the river). Lycoming Creek forms the western border of the township, with Old Lycoming Township across the creek. The townships of Hepburn and Eldred form the northern border. The most densely settled part of the township is in the south, comprising the unincorporated communities of Faxon to the west and Kenmar to the east.
