<text>Pocola is a town in Le Flore County, Oklahoma, United States. It is part of the Fort Smith, Arkansas-Oklahoma metropolitan area. The population was 4,056 in 2010, a gain of 1.6 percent over the figure of 3,994 recorded in 2000. &quot;Pocola&quot; is a Choctaw word meaning &quot;ten&quot;, the approximate distance in miles from Fort Smith, Arkansas.

==History==
The Battle of Devil&#x27;s Backbone took place nearby on September 1, 1863, and resulted in a victory for the Union Army.

A post office was established at Pocola, Indian Territory on February 15, 1881. The community took its name from the Choctaw word for the number ten, as the site was ten miles from Fort Smith, Arkansas. At the time of its founding the settlement was located in Skullyville County, a part of the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

Will Hartshorne began operating a small coal mine in this area during the 1880s. By 1895, he employed six men, and sold the mine to the Fort Smith and Western Coal and Railway in the following year. The population of Pocola was estimated at 200 in 1900, but the number declined to about 75 in 1918. The post office closed in 1916.

The community did not incorporate until 1963, allowing it to gain water rights along the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System and to ensure that the area was not annexed by other Le Flore County communities. The town began annexing land, enlarging itself to about 30 square miles. By 1970, the population had grown to 1,840. In 1980, the census recorded 3,268 residents. A post office was reestablished in 1986.

<text>Poteau ( ) is a city in, and county seat of, LeFlore County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 8,520 as of the 2010 census.

==History==
In 1719, Bernard de la Harpe led a group of French explorers through this area and gave the river its present name. The present day city was founded in 1885, its name derived from the nearby Poteau River. During the late 1700s, there was a large French outpost at Belle Point (Ft. Smith). From there, they would travel up the Poteau River to a secondary post at the base of Cavanal Mountain. Because of this, the river was named the &quot;Post River&quot;, or Poteau River, and the outpost was simply called the post, or &quot;Poteau&quot;. A group of French explorers gave the river its present name during the early 18th Century. &quot;Poteau&quot; is a French word meaning post.

The Poteau Chamber of Commerce has written that the community was founded in 1885 as a few houses and Bud Tate&#x27;s general store. At the time of its founding, Poteau was in Sugar Loaf County, a part of the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation. It was incorporated as a town in the Indian Territory by the federal government on October 8, 1898. The first stone public building, a school, was built in the same year.

The Fort Smith and Southern Railway built a rail line through the Poteau area in 1886–1887, en route to Paris, Texas, including a station within the city. The Poteau post office opened in 1887 and the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad (acquired by the Kansas City Southern Railway in 1900) began serving the town in 1896.

In 1900, the Federal Court of Indian Territory was moved from Cameron, Oklahoma to Poteau. The &quot;Poteau News&quot; was first published in 1905. Other modern improvements during the run-up to statehood included: The Bank of Poteau in 1901 (which became a national bank in 1904), and the First Bank of Poteau in 1904. A telephone company franchise was granted in 1904, and an electric utility and waterworks system was begun in 1906.

After statehood, Governor Charles N. Haskell declared Poteau as a, &quot;... city of the first class.&quot;

==Geography==

The city is located in the valley below Cavanal Hill, dubbed the &quot;World&#x27;s Highest Hill&quot; with a signed elevation of . The location was a subject of extensive coal mining in the first half of the 20th Century, and a railway, eventually called the Poteau and Cavanal Mountain Railroad, served the mines. The summit elevation of the hill is above sea level, while the hill rises above the Poteau River on the east side of Poteau.

At the time of its founding the community was located in Sugar Loaf County, a part of the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

In 1894, the settlement moved eastward to the proposed route of the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad, which built a track through Indian Territory in 1895–96. In 1900, the Kansas City Southern Railway bought out the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad. The population was estimated at 200 In 1901. In the same year, the Poteau Valley Railroad built tracks from Shady Point to the mines at Sutter (which was renamed Calhoun in 1914), bringing prosperity to Shady Point as a coal shipping point.

Agriculture became the basis for Shady Point&#x27;s economy during the Great Depression. The Evans Coal Company closed its deep-shaft coal mine in 1980, the same year the town incorporated. The population then was 235. Applied Energy Services built a power plant in 1991 that burned half of the coal produced in Oklahoma by the end of the twentieth century.

<doc id="130319" wikidata="Q1968037" url="?curid=130319" title="Spiro, Oklahoma">
<text>Spiro is a town in Le Flore County, Oklahoma, United States. It is part of the Fort Smith, Arkansas-Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,164 at the 2010 census, a 2.8 percent decline from the figure of 2,227 recorded in 2000.

Developed as a railroad station in an agricultural area in the late 19th century, the small town is notable for its proximity to the Spiro Mounds. This is a Mississippian culture center that was active from about 900 to 1450 CE that was part of a culture in Eastern Oklahoma and Western Arkansas. Today, the 80-acre site with several earthwork mounds is preserved as Oklahoma&#x27;s only State Archeological Park and one of North America&#x27;s most important archaeological sites. It is the westernmost site of the expansive Mississippian culture, which had associated centers through the Mississippi and tributary river valleys.

==History==
In 1895 and 1896, the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad (later owned by the Kansas City Southern Railroad) established a station at the present site of Spiro, which connected the area to the city of Fort Smith, Arkansas. This railroad access attracted residents from the nearby town of Skullyville, and Spiro soon developed as the principal town in this area. The town population was 543 in 1900.

A post office was established at Spiro, Indian Territory on September 21, 1898. At the time of its founding, Spiro was located in Skullyville County, a part of the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

Several accounts differ as to how the post office was named. One claims that Spiro was the maiden name of the first postmistress. Another claims it was the maiden name of the mother of a Fort Smith banker. According to the Oklahoma Historical Society, Spiro was named after Celia Spiro, wife of an Oklahoma banker, Iser H Nakdimen. He founded the City National Bank in Ft. Smith, Arkansas and the First National Bank in Muldrow, Oklahoma.

Cotton was an important cash crop. In 1901, Spiro had three cotton yards and one cotton gin. By 1910, there were three cotton gins and the population had grown to 1,173. As cotton cultivation became more mechanized, labor needs declined. The Great Depression of the 1930s took the heart out of the market. Timber harvesting and processing and livestock became important industries in the region. The population declined to 969 in 1930, as agricultural workers migrated to other areas for jobs. It rebounded to 1,365 by 1950 as the economy grew.

On March 26, 1976, the town was struck by an F5 tornado, the highest level on the Fujita scale, resulting in two deaths.

<text>Wister is a town in Le Flore County, Oklahoma, United States. It is part of the Fort Smith metropolitan area. The population was 1,102 at the 2010 census. Wister is named for Gutman G. Wister, an official with the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad.

==History==
A post office was established at Wister, Indian Territory, on June 30, 1890. The community was named for an official of the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad, one of the two railroads that intersected in the town.

At the time of its founding, Wister was located in Sugar Loaf County, a part of the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

Until it became known as Wister, the settlement had been known as Wister Junction, due to its location at the crossing of two railroad routes. The Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad was an east-west route linking Wister Junction with McAlester and passing through lucrative coal mining towns along the way. Its eastern terminus was at the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad, a north-south route connecting Fort Smith, Arkansas with Paris, Texas. After receiving its post office, the town could no longer be known as Wister Junction, as federal post office regulations forbade new post offices from carrying descriptive names such as &quot;Junction,&quot; &quot;Mountain,&quot; or &quot;Corner.&quot;

==Geography==
Wister is located east of McAlester and west of the Oklahoma-Arkansas border.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (2.04%) is water.

<text>Agra is a town in northern Lincoln County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 339 at the 2010 census. An early real estate developer coined the town&#x27;s name from the word &quot;agriculture&quot;.

==History==
Agra began to form around the turn of 20th century. A post office opened in Agra on December 20, 1902, with Isaac C. Pierce serving as the first postmaster. The Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad (which later became part of the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway (also known as MKT or &quot;Katy&quot;) built a line from Oklahoma City to Parsons, Kansas between 1902 and 1904. The townsite was developed after two local farmers, Frank Wheeler and Sam Holder, sold their lands along the railroad. American Land Loan and Trust Company divided the site into town lots.

The first businesses in town were a drugstore, opened by John Olmstead and a general store opened by Mark Crane. Otherwise, the first buildings were houses and a few churches. The Bank of Agra was built in 1904. School was taught in churches until 1905, when the first school building was constructed. By 1918, the town had also added the Commercial Hotel and a cotton gin. Early newspapers published in Agra were the &quot;Agra News&quot; and the &quot;Queen City Times&quot;. However, both the nickname and the newspaper passed into oblivion many years ago.

In the 21st century, most of the permanent residents have been employed by the oil and gas industry, and/or commuted to work in other towns. Agra is essentially a bedroom community. It is now a small country town, but has 3 churches, a restaurant, elementary and high school, post office, and convenience store.

<text>Chandler () is a city in, and the county seat of, Lincoln County, Oklahoma, United States. and is part of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area. The population was 2,858 at the time of the 2020 census. Chandler is located northeast of Oklahoma City on SH-66 and I-44, and north of Shawnee on SH-18.

== History ==
Chandler was named after Judge George Chandler, also Assistant Secretary of the Interior. The site of Chandler was opened by a land run on September 28, 1891. The town had been planned to be opened on September 22, (the date of the &quot;Land Run of 1891&quot;) but the site survey had not been completed. The Chandler Post Office had opened September 21, the day before the planned run. When Oklahoma Territory County A (Lincoln County) was organized, Chandler became the county seat. On March 30, 1897, a tornado destroyed most of the fledgling town and killed 14 residents.

In 1891 the county government operated from an office building until a courthouse was built. The courthouse was destroyed by the tornado of 1897, and a two-story frame building was erected as a temporary courthouse on the present site. The building was removed in 1907 to make way for a stone courthouse. This third courthouse burned down on December 23, 1967 and the current courthouse was constructed in its place.

On July 31, 1894, Cherokee Bill and the gang he was riding with stole $500 from the Lincoln County Bank in Chandler, Oklahoma.

The St. Louis and Oklahoma City Railroad (later the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway, also known as the &quot;Frisco&quot;) built a line through Chandler in 1898. Another railroad, the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Western Railroad (later a part of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway), built between Chandler and Guthrie in the 1902-1903 timeframe. The railroads enabled Chandler to move its agricultural products, as well as bricks made by the Chandler Brick Company, to markets.

Chandler is one of the many cities along the famous U.S. Route 66 and contains a number of attractions to devotees of &quot;The Mother Road.&quot; These include The Route 66 Interpretive Center, The Oklahoma Law Enforcement Museum and Hall of Fame, The Lincoln County Museum of Pioneer History, several Route 66-themed murals, the newly restored old cottage-style Phillips 66 gas station, and one of the last remaining painted barns advertising Meramec Caverns, which is on Route 66 in Missouri.

U.S. Route 66 brought a significant amount of commercial business to Chandler, due to travelers crossing the state and the country; much of this business died out when the Turner Turnpike (Interstate 44) was built.

In 1949, the Oklahoma legislature declared Chandler to be &quot;The pecan capital of the world,&quot; in Resolution No. 5.

In 1958, professional baseball player Bo Belcher opened Chandler Baseball Camp. For 42 years, the camp hosted campers from around the world for a bootcamp-like baseball camp during summers. The camp closed in 2000 due to the death of Tom Belcher (not to be confused with fellow baseball player Tim Belcher). In 2011 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Chandler has a total area of , of which is land and (10.43%) is water.

Fallis was founded in 1892, just south of an Indian village on the western edge of the Iowa Reservation, in a wooded area and &quot;on a long red hill.&quot; Originally known as Mission, it was renamed in 1894 for its prime developer and first postmaster, Judge William Henry Fallis. Although the town is mostly abandoned today, and is nearly a ghost town, during the early 1900s Fallis was a whistle-stop for several railroad lines, and was a thriving little community with stores, hotels, banks, lumber yards, and other businesses, as well as a city hall.

<text>Prague ( ) is a city in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 2,356 at the 2020 census, a 1.76 percent decrease from the figure of 2,388 in 2010. Czech immigrants founded the city, and named it after the capital of the present-day Czech Republic.

==History==
After the opening of the Sac and Fox Reservation by a land run on September 22, 1891, Czech immigrants settled and founded Prague.

The town&#x27;s name has been adopted in Sac and Fox language as &quot;Pwêkeki&quot;.

On March 27, 1943, the film &quot;Hangmen Also Die!&quot; had its world premiere in Prague in an event which featured Adolf Hitler, Hirohito and Mussolini being hanged in effigy on Main Street. The town of Prague was apparently chosen because the movie is loosely based on the 1942 assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the Nazi Reich Protector of the German-occupied city of Prague, now in the Czech Republic. After the premiere, the film opened nationwide in the first days of April, beginning with 20 key cities.

==History==
Located on the Deep Fork River in eastern Lincoln County and five miles (8 km) east of State Highway 18 on State Highway 18B, Sparks lies between Meeker and Chandler. The town is situated on land that was once part of the Sac and Fox Reservation, which was dissolved in 1890 when the principal chiefs signed an agreement with the Jerome Commission that each tribal member would receive a allotment. The surplus land was opened to settlement in a land run on September 22, 1891. The original townsite totaled and was homesteaded by William and Tabitha Baker.

The Eastern Oklahoma Railway (acquired by Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in 1907) and the Fort Smith and Western Railroad (FS&amp;W) established plans for a town at the junction of the two lines as they began surveying Lincoln County in 1902. The town was named in honor of George T. Sparks, an FS&amp;W director. The first school, known as Ball School, was built southeast of Sparks in the late 1890s. In addition, there were two subscription schools, which charged a dollar per pupil per month. A post office was established on August 30, 1902, and the town eventually had approximately fifty businesses. Soon, two newspapers, the Sparks Review and the Sparks Visitor, were published, both Republican in politics. At 1907 statehood the population was 503.

When farm prices fell after World War I and during the Great Depression, people looked elsewhere for employment. In 1920 and 1930 the federal census reported 472 and 470 citizens, respectively. The last bank closed in 1938, and rail service ceased in 1939. By 1940 the population dropped to 339. The high school closed in 1957, and the grade school closed in 1993. The number of citizens declined from 233 in 1950 to 183 in 1970. At the turn of the 21st century the town, with 137 residents, had a post office, a few churches, a rural water district, a volunteer fire department, and two community centers, one in the Old Sparks School Building, which served as a senior citizens&#x27; center and town library.

On November 5, 2011, a 5.7-magnitude earthquake occurred near Sparks. At the time, it was the largest earthquake in Oklahoma&#x27;s history. This record lasted for less than five years; a larger, 5.8-magnitude earthquake broke the record on September 3, 2016.

<doc id="130336" wikidata="Q3287212" url="?curid=130336" title="Coyle, Oklahoma">
<text>Coyle is a town in Logan County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 325 at the 2010 census, compared to the figure of 337 in 2000. It is part of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. The town was named for William Coyle, an influential Guthrie business man.

Founded in Oklahoma Territory before statehood, Coyle initially prospered as an agricultural town and because of the arrival of the railroad. However, the demand for the area&#x27;s principal crop, cotton, declined sharply after World War I. Rail service ended during the 1950s. By 2000, it was estimated that 95 percent of the employed residents commuted to work in larger towns nearby.

==History==
Coyle began as an agricultural community in 1899 when the Eastern Oklahoma Railway, a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway built a branch line from Guthrie to Cushing. William H. Coyle, a Guthrie entrepreneur, and U. C. Guss were employed as purchasing agents by the railroad company to acquire right of way, and were awarded an opportunity to select a townsite as a bonus for their successful work. They chose a location south of Iowa City, a community previously established on the Cimarron River. Almost all of the Iowa City residents moved to the new location as soon as they became aware that the railroad route would bypass Iowa City. The Iowa City post office remained at the old location, while a new post office was established in the new town, which was named Coyle after its founder. The Coyle post office opened May 5, 1900. Iowa City became a ghost town even before Oklahoma Territory became part of the state of Oklahoma.

Agriculture supported the town&#x27;s economy, with cotton being the main crop. Early businesses in Coyle included a bank, a blacksmith, cotton gins, a drug store, a furniture store, some general stores, a lumberyard, and a photographer. The &quot;Cimarron Valley Clipper&quot; newspaper began publication in 1900 and continued until 1949. The town had two saloons until 1904, when temperance crusader Carrie Nation visited Coyle and held a public debate with Coyle&#x27;s Superintendent of Schools, Martin E. Trapp. Immediately afterward, the city government outlawed the saloons.

After WWI, the demand for cotton declined sharply, causing many local farms to become unprofitable. The population of Coyle continued to increase, reaching a peak of 440 at the 1940 census. Railroad service ended in the late 1950s. Since then, about 95 percent of the employed residents of Coyle have commuted to work in larger towns nearby, such as Stillwater, Guthrie, and Oklahoma City.

==Geography==
Coyle is northeast of Guthrie, the seat of Logan County and west of the confluence of Fitzgerald Creek and the Cimarron River. Coyle is located in North Cimarron Township of Logan County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

<text>Crescent is a city in Logan County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,299 as of the 2020 United States census. It is part of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Crescent was formed with the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889 on March 2, 1889, and officially started that fall when William Brown began selling general merchandise out of a wagon. Soon he took on a partner, Benjamin Ryland, and the two moved into a log cabin. A post office christened &quot;Crescent City&quot; was established on February 21, 1890, the name taken from a moon-shaped glade where the town began. In November 1891 the town site was platted, and incorporated in 1893. The Denver, Enid and Gulf Railroad laid track one mile (1.6 km) west of the city in 1902, and the city obtained of land from two farmers (C. E. Wells and J. H. Rhoades) creating &quot;new Crescent&quot; or &quot;West Crescent&quot;; eventually the town moved to the new location. Oil was discovered north of town in 1926 and then south of town in 1930 in the &quot;Crescent Oil Field&quot;.

On June 20, 1934 the Farmers and Merchants Bank was robbed by a group of men. The group took 13 hostages to help conceal the attempt and to help move the safe. They had the hostages load the safe into the back of a truck and drove the hostages and safe out of town. They ended up leaving both behind, hostages unhurt and safe unopened.

In 1965 the Cimarron Processing Facility was opened by Kerr-McGee (owned through a subsidiary, Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corp.) to convert powdered uranium hexafluoride and plutonium into fuel pellets for use in the nation&#x27;s nuclear power plants. The site became the center of highly controversial revelations within the petrochemical industry, when in the early 1970s, working conditions and manufacturing practices at the facility became dangerous. The 1983 Oscar-nominated film &quot;Silkwood&quot;, based around Karen Silkwood (who became contaminated) and her death (in 1974), is a movie about those revelations. In 1976 the facility ceased production. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stated that the groundwater contamination (near where the company once buried radioactive waste) was rising near the plant and was 400 times higher than federal drinking-water standards allowed in 1989, while levels were 208 to 360 times higher than federal standards in 1985–87. Several cleanup and decommissioning projects have been attempted, with none completed as of 2011.

<text>Guthrie is a city and county seat in Logan County, Oklahoma, United States, and a part of the Oklahoma City Metroplex. The population was 10,191 at the 2010 census, a 2.7 percent increase from the figure of 9,925 in the 2000 census. First known as a railroad station stop, after the Land Run of 1889, Guthrie immediately gained 10,000 new residents, who began to develop the town. It was rapidly improved and was designated as the territorial capital, and in 1907 as the first state capital of Oklahoma. In 1910, state voters chose the larger Oklahoma City as the new capital in a special election.

Guthrie is nationally significant for its collection of late 19th and early 20th century commercial architecture. The Guthrie Historic District includes more than 2,000 buildings and is designated as a National Historic Landmark. Historic tourism is important to the city, and its Victorian architecture provides a backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.

== History ==
Guthrie was established in 1887 as a railroad station called Deer Creek on the Southern Kansas Railway (later acquired by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway) running from the Kansas–Oklahoma border to Purcell. The name was later changed to Guthrie, named for jurist John Guthrie of Topeka, Kansas. A post office was established on April 4, 1889.

In 1889, some 50,000 potential settlers gathered at the edges of the Unassigned Lands in hopes of staking a claim to a plot. At noon on April 22, 1889, cannons resounded at a section of Indian Territory, launching president Benjamin Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Hoss Race&quot; or Land Run of 1889. People ran for both farmlands and towns.

During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma. Within months, Guthrie was developed as a modern brick and stone &quot;Queen of the Prairie&quot; with municipal water, electricity, a mass transit system, and underground parking garages for horses and carriages.

Guthrie&#x27;s western heritage includes the fact that, on April 13, 1898, outlaw Richard &quot;Little Dick&quot; West, a former member of the Wild Bunch gang, was in town when approached by legendary lawmen Heck Thomas and Bill Tilghman. He refused to surrender and was killed in the resulting gunfight. He is buried in the Summit View Cemetery in Guthrie near outlaw Bill Doolin.

Hobart Johnstone Whitley, also known as HJ and the &#x27;Father of Hollywood,&#x27; was the first president of the Guthrie Chamber of Commerce. Whitley built the first brick block building in the territory for his National Loan &amp; Trust Company. He was asked by the local people to be the first Governor of Oklahoma. Whitley traveled to Washington, D.C. where he persuaded the U.S. Congress to allow Guthrie to be the new capital of the future state of Oklahoma. This was specified in the 1906 Oklahoma Enabling Act, which established certain requirements for the new state constitution. By 1907, when Guthrie became the state capital, it looked like a well-established Eastern city.

Guthrie prospered as the administrative center of the territory, but it was eclipsed in economic influence by Oklahoma City early in the 20th century. Oklahoma City had become a major junction for several railroads and had also attracted a major industry in the form of meat packing. Oklahoma City business leaders began campaigning soon after statehood to make Oklahoma City the new state capital, and in 1910 a special election was held to determine the location of the state capital. 96,488 votes were cast for Oklahoma City; 31,031 for Guthrie; and 8,382 for Shawnee. Governor Charles N. Haskell, who was in Tulsa on the day of the election, ordered his secretary W. B. Anthony to have Oklahoma Secretary of State Bill Cross obtain the state seal and transport it to Oklahoma City, despite having been served a restraining order by Logan County Sheriff John Mahoney blocking the transfer. Anthony obtained written authorization from Cross, retrieved the seal from the Logan County courthouse, and delivered it to Oklahoma City.

After the capital was transferred, Guthrie lost much of its government-related business and numerous residents. It began to dwindle in size and soon lost its status as Oklahoma&#x27;s second-largest city, initially to Muskogee, then later to Tulsa. A challenge to the new state capital was heard in the Oklahoma Supreme Court; it upheld the election and move in its ruling on February 9, 1911, as did the United States Supreme Court in 1911.

The center district of Guthrie was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service in 1999, in recognition of the city&#x27;s importance to state history, as well as its rich architecture.

=== Culture ===
As a result of Guthrie&#x27;s early loss of prominence, it has a well-preserved Victorian enclave. Whereas growth and inattentive urban planning caused other Oklahoma towns such as Oklahoma City to destroy much of their early downtown architecture, much of the entire central business and residential district of Guthrie is intact.

The National Finals Steer Roping Rodeo is held in Guthrie. On six occasions, the Texas rodeo promoter Dan Taylor was chute director for the competition in Guthrie.

Historical tourism has become a significant industry for the town. Guthrie is the largest urban Historic district in Oklahoma, containing 2,169 buildings, and 400 city blocks. Guthrie is a &quot;Certified City;&quot; it has received a Community Development Block Grant to inventory infrastructure features for Capital Improvement Planning.

Guthrie has two lakes to the south, Liberty Lake and Guthrie Lake. Its museums include the Oklahoma Territorial Museum and hosts the Oklahoma International Bluegrass Festival, which draws 15,000 visitors annually. In addition, Guthrie claims to be the &quot;Bed and Breakfast capital of Oklahoma.

Guthrie also hosts the Guthrie Scottish Rite Masonic Temple, one of the world&#x27;s largest Masonic Centers, which in years past has brought artists such as Henry Mancini, Lena Horne, Victor Borge, and Luciano Pavarotti to local audiences.

Guthrie has Oklahoma&#x27;s oldest year-round professional theatre company, the Pollard Theatre Company. With an emphasis on creative story-telling to illuminate the shared human experience, the Pollard produces six or more plays and musicals annually, enlisting artists across the United States. The annual holiday favorite is &quot;A Territorial Christmas Carol.&quot;

Guthrie is served by the &quot;Guthrie News-Leader&quot; newspaper.

<text>Langston is a town in Logan County, Oklahoma, United States, and is part of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,619 as of the 2020 United States census. Langston is home to Langston University, the only historically black college in Oklahoma.

==History==
Langston was founded on April 22, 1890, by Edward P. McCabe, a Black American political figure from Kansas. McCabe helped lead a migration of black settlers from southern U.S. states who hoped to escape discrimination by creating a majority-black state in what was then the Territory of Oklahoma. He named the town for John Mercer Langston, a black member of the 51st United States Congress from Virginia. McCabe used traveling salesmen and African-American newspapers to advertise lots for sale in Langston, and the deeds which accompanied the sale of these lots stipulated that their re-sale could only be to other African-Americans.

Langston was an all black town, one of fifty identifiable black towns and settlements created in Oklahoma between 1865 and 1920.

By 1891, Langston had a population of 200, which included a preacher, doctor, and schoolteacher. By 1892, the town had 25 businesses, with a bank and a public school. A Roman Catholic mission was established in 1893 by Bishop Theophile Meerschaert and the Benedictine Sisters. The town had a telephone system in service in 1895. In 1897, the Oklahoma Territorial Legislature passed a law creating the Colored Agricultural and Normal University at Langston (which later became Langston University).

<text>Marshall is a rural town in Logan County, Oklahoma, United States, and is an outer suburb/exurb on the northern edge of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 210 as of the 2020 United States census.

==History==
Marshall began as a community when the Unassigned Lands were opened for settlement in 1889. Sylvan T. Rice opened a post office in 1890. Rice was from Marshalltown, Iowa and named the new town Marshall after his home town. He also opened the first store in 1894. The town boomed after the opening of the Cherokee Strip in 1893.

The Denver, Enid and Gulf Railroad built a track nearby a few years later in 1902 a half-mile from town so the entire town moved to be near the railroad. Marshall was incorporated in 1903. The railroad was bought by the Eastern Oklahoma Railway in 1907, which resold it to the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad in the same year.

Famous Oklahoma author Dr. Angie Debo was from Marshall, Oklahoma. She died in 1988. She had written many books about the fate of Indians. Her portrait hangs in the Oklahoma Capitol. Miss Debo wrote a book called Prairie City which was loosely based on Marshall, and Marshall started a town celebration in 1968 in honor of Miss Debo called Prairie City Days.

Marshall was known as the school band &quot;capital&quot; of the world in the 1940s. Area schools would come to compete and march down main street. It was known as &quot;The Biggest Little Band Festival in the World&quot; and was held from 1938 to 1951. It was founded by Tibby Shades (school superintendent) and Ashley Alexander Sr. (band director). It was cancelled in 1952 due to the state band contest being scheduled on the same date and was never revived. It grew to such magnitude that WKY radio out of Oklahoma City broadcast the marching band performances held on main street. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol increased participation on festival day to assist with the traffic situation. Fifty-Seven towns converged on Marshall in 1951 to participate in the festival with sixty-five performing groups. It is believed 5,000 participated in the 1951 festival.

Marshall&#x27;s two-story brick school was built in 1904 and in the 1950s the second story was torn down and classes was built around the first story.

Marshall&#x27;s had its last high school graduating class in 1976. It continued as a middle school (grades 5–8) until 1988 when the school closed its doors for good. Today most of the roof has fallen in. The gymnasium is the only part of the school that is still in good shape. Today it is used for the annual volunteer firemen&#x27;s rib dinner. People come from all around to attend and it averages over 1000 people.

Marshall is said to have the widest main street in the USA. It is said that a team of horses made a &quot;U&quot; turn and that determined how wide they made main street. Also, it is said that when the town was moved 1/2 mile west in order to be located adjacent to the railroad, the city fathers, when laying out the town site, decided to make the streets wide enough to accommodate angle parking at the curbs, two lanes of traffic, and sufficient room for street cars. It was thought if Marshall should ever become a large city like Chicago that having the streets wide enough would be of great benefit. The main street lacks six feet being as wide as a football field which was perfect for marching band performances during the band festival.

Outlaw Dick Yeager alias Zip Wyatt was shot and killed SW of Marshall. Miss Debo wrote in one of her books that the Dalton gang stopped in one time and bought supplies from the general merchandise store and left with no problems.

There are two cemeteries in Marshall. One that used to be called Pleasant Ridge or today called South Marshall IOOF and the North Marshall IOOF.

Back in the town&#x27;s prime between 1900 and 1980 it had two gas stations, a hotel, 5-dime store, drug store, cafe, bar, grocery store, laundromat, hardware store, lawyer office, bank, doctor office, blacksmith, barber shop, beauty shop, fire station, arcade, movie theatre, two car dealers and farmers&#x27; co-op. Today all that is left is the co-op and post office. Where main street was once lined with cars on Saturdays is now pretty much a ghost town. Most of the building downtown are or have fallen down or empty. During the 1980s the oil bust happened and the town hasn&#x27;t been the same ever since.

Marshall is mostly populated by farmers and people who commute to nearby cities to work. The main agriculture is wheat and cattle.

In 1927, SW of Marshall, an oil field was found called Roxanna. Production was found in the Ordovician Wilcox Sand at depths of ~6000&#x27; with initial production rates as high as . A boom town started and oil hands filtered into Marshall. There is nothing left of Roxanna today.

<text>Mulhall is a town in Logan (mostly) and Payne counties in Oklahoma, United States. The population was 212 as of the 2020 United States census. It is part of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The town began as a railroad station for the Santa Fe railroad, and was originally named Alfred, for the son of an attorney. The town is named for Zach Mulhall, father of Lucille Mulhall, who was the first official &#x27;cowgirl&#x27; to actually compete against men in rodeo events and win. The town name was changed from Alfred to Mulhall shortly after the land run of 1889 because there were two towns named &#x27;Alfred&#x27; at that time, according to a petition made by Zach to the railroad.
Zach Mulhall hosted his own show for many years across the country, with Lucille starring in those shows along with her siblings. Zach and the Mulhall family were also friends with the Miller Brothers of 101 Ranch Fame in nearby Ponca City and often performed with them and shared talent for their shows when needed. Will Rogers and Tom Mix were also integral parts of the early years of the shows and Will (then performing under the stage name, &quot;The Cherokee Kid}&quot;) is credited with teaching Lucille how to twirl-another talent for which she was known.

Carrie Nation visited Mulhall in 1901 to tell the town saloons about the evils of liquor and warning that she would return. The town immediately ordered the saloon out of business.

In 1907, &quot;Leslie&#x27;s Weekly&quot; carried a picture of Lucille, calling her the world&#x27;s champion lariat thrower, a title she won in San Antonio. It also states that she entertained President Theodore Roosevelt.

About 80 percent of the town was destroyed on May 3, 1999, 110 years after the town&#x27;s founding, by a violent high-end F4 tornado (possibly F5 before hitting the town) which was recorded to be well over one mile wide at times. The town&#x27;s water tower collapsed due to the violent winds. Fortunately, police were able to warn residents of the imminent danger and no one in Mulhall was killed. However, besides the water tower collapsing, the wedge tornado also leveled 60–70% of the 130 homes in Mulhall and destroyed the Mulhall/Orlando Elementary School.

Lucille&#x27;s Restaurant, located in the old Bank Building, was one of the few original structures to survive the tornado. The restaurant boasted eclectic photographs of Lucille and her family during the heyday of their lives and performances in Wild West shows featured in the decor. On September 2, 2009, the restaurant was extensively damaged by fire. It was rebuilt and catered to a variety of customers from families to bikers. On October 21, 2018, it closed permanently. On March 12, 2021, the restaurant was purchased by new owners and is being reopened under the name Lucille&#x27;s Chuckwagon on May 20, 2021. The Methodist church also survived, and is pictured behind the old Mulhall School.

<text>Orlando is a town in Logan and Payne counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The population was 148 at the 2010 census, compared to the figure of 201 in 2000. It is part of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Before the opening of the Cherokee Outlet for settlement, this community was called Cherokee, but the name was changed to Orlando, when a post office was opened on July 18, 1889.

Early Orlando had a colorful history. In 1892, Oliver Yantis, a member of the Doolin Gang, was wounded and captured outside of the town. He was brought into Orlando, where he died. In 1896, a group of con artists bought some homesteads near the town, salted them with gold nuggets and started a gold rush. Several townspeople lost a great deal of money before the plot was exposed. In 1902, a woman who had bought adulterated kerosene for the lamps in her house. The impure material exploded when she lit the lamps, starting a fire that killed her, two children and spread to several nearby houses.

A 1927 tornado killed two people and destroyed several houses. Construction of Lake Carl Blackwell in the 1930s forced about 100 families that had regularly traded in Orlando to move away.

Passenger train service through Orlando ceased after World War II ended, and construction of I-35 caused the town to lose most of its commercial highway traffic after 1964.

==History==
Settlers were attracted by the fertile land near the Red River, which was conducive to agriculture and cattle raising. Cotton quickly became the principal crop. William &quot;Bill&quot; Washington had the largest cattle ranch in Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation, Indian Territory. Bill&#x27;s brother, Jeremiah Calvin Washington (Jerry), who lived about a mile north of present-day Marietta on the Washington Ranch which has a historical marker and is lived in by a Washington descendant&#x27;s extended family, became the town&#x27;s first postmaster when the post office opened on December 20, 1887. He was a banker and gentleman rancher. A local story claims that the town was named for Jerry&#x27;s wife, Marietta Love Washington.

At the time of its founding, Marietta was located in Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation.

The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway (later the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway) laid its rail line in early 1887, stimulating economic growth for the future town of Marietta, Indian Territory. The first train ran July 28, 1887.

Marietta had 1,391 settlers at the time of Oklahoma Statehood in 1907. The Love County Courthouse, one of four sites in the town listed on the NRHP, was the first built after statehood in Oklahoma and was completed in 1910. There were 1,546 residents in the 1910 census, and the town was served by at least three banks, three churches and 24 retail establishments.

The northwestern part of town was hit by a violent EF4 tornado on April 27, 2024. A large Dollar Tree metal distribution warehouse was shredded with part of the structure collapsing and the next door Homeland was partially blown out when a large wall collapsed. One person was killed on I-35.

Soon after, the Siemens plant closed. Months later the Chickasaw Nation bought the Siemens plant and rehired many of the former employees. That facility now builds and repairs oil field equipment. Still later, it bought the bakery and reopened it, though with a much smaller work force.

<doc id="130347" wikidata="Q3287632" url="?curid=130347" title="Thackerville, Oklahoma">
<text>Thackerville is a town in Love County, Oklahoma, United States. It is located near the Texas state border. The population was 400 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Thackerville is situated near the intersection of U.S. Highway 77 and State Highway 153, five miles north of the Texas state line and ten miles south of Marietta in south central Love County. Interstate 35 passes through town, putting Thackerville on the main route between Oklahoma City and Dallas/Ft. Worth.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Thackerville was founded in the mid-19th century. The community is named after Zacariah Thacker, a pioneer from Arkansas. It is believed that he was headed for the Amarillo, Texas area, but he camped one night at Wolf Hollow Creek in Indian Territory and remained there until his death a few years later. Thacker befriended some of the local Indians and together they farmed a very productive corn crop. Before long, many people began settling in the area.

After Thacker&#x27;s death in 1887, the community relocated from its original site near where Wolf Creek enters the Red River, to its present location. The main reason behind the move was to be closer to the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway. A depot was constructed and the first grocery store, built by Oce McCage, opened across from it. Soon after, a school, churches, and a post office were constructed. Thackerville had a dirt main street with board walks that connected store porches.

==History==

Kingston was originally known as Helen. The community was named for Helen Willis, daughter of J.H. Willis, a prominent early-day resident. On April 4, 1894, a post office was established at Helen and was called Kingston, Indian Territory. The post office took its name from Jeff King, a longtime local resident.

At the time of its founding, Helen, later Kingston, was located in Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation, in Indian Territory. This was one of the Five Civilized Tribes required to remove to this area from the Southeast United States in the 1830s.

The early settlement included a general store, cotton gin, and a schoolhouse that doubled as a church.

Several of the older buildings in Kingston were torn down in the late 1980s for redevelopment of the area for a new hardware store and lumberyard. The town constructed a new multipurpose activity building, which is located on the high school campus. The oldest remaining building in Kingston, which originally was the town bank, has been adapted for retail use as Dee&#x27;s Creative Corner.

Kingston&#x27;s High School Alumni Association, founded in 1911 soon after statehood, is the oldest active alumni association in the state of Oklahoma. Each year graduates of Kingston High School are given the opportunity to join the association. Through their donations and fund raisers, the Alumni Association helps to send local students to college.

Notable figures include country music singer, Dale Lay, and rock and roll drummer Greg Upchurch. Lay released several country albums, several radio singles, and performed at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee. He developed and supported the Kingston High School band. For several years, Lay raised money to buy new instruments and band uniforms at his annual benefit concert.

Dale’s son, Anthony Lay, is a nationally syndicated radio personality. He goes by the moniker “The AntMan” and hosts a syndicated Saturday night show, &quot;Country House Party&quot;, broadcast on more than 80 iHeart Country radio stations across the nation. 

Greg Upchurch began his rock career with the band Puddle of Mudd. Since 2005 he has been the drummer for 3 Doors Down. Upchurch first developed his percussion skills in the Kingston High School band.

On March 21, 2022, an EF2 tornado caused significant damage to structures.

==Kingston High School==

After a new high school was built, the original high school building was adapted for use as an elementary school. Today, the elementary, middle, and high schools each have their own buildings.

The school reportedly had a pool, which was filled in and paved to serve as a parking lot. In 2019 a new high school with more classrooms was completed.

A.E. Findley was the band director of Kingston High School&#x27;s first band. He was the first band director elected into the Oklahoma Bandmasters Association in 1966.

The high school has two blood drives each year and does a yearly food drive as part of their charity work.

Kingston High School and Madill High School have a football rivalry, known as the “Marshall County Super Bowl.” The schools alternated as hosts for the bowl games. Madill was the site of the bowl until the teams played again in fall 2020. That competition was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Once vaccines were made available, this competition resumed in fall 2021, with Kingston being the host school once again.

<text>Madill is a city in and the county seat of Marshall County, Oklahoma, United States. It was named in honor of George Alexander Madill, an attorney for the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway. The population was 3,914 as of the 2020 Census, up 3.8% from the figure reported in the 2010 census of 3,770, which itself was an increase of 10.8 percent from the 3,410 reported at the 2000 census.

==History==
Madill was founded in 1900 by William N. Taliaferro, who had settled in 1886, in what was then known as Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation, in the Indian Territory. Taliaferro owned a farm and operated some ranches in the nearby town of Oakland, northwest of Madill. Oakland had been the area&#x27;s largest town, but the St. Louis, San Francisco and New Orleans Railroad building through the town caused Madill to grow and Oakland, two miles northwest, to decline. A post office was established at Madill on April 29, 1901, The city was chartered on September 12, 1902. The first public school opened in a four-room frame structure built on the south side of the town in 1903.

Farming and ranching became the town&#x27;s principal industries early in its history because the surrounding area was highly fertile and the railroad provided good transportation to markets. There were also mineral springs nearby, and an oil seep north of town. The Arbuckle oilfield was discovered in 1904, and experienced another boom in 1924. Pure Oil Company brought in a well east of town in 1939 and built a company town called Pure Camp to house the oilfield workers. Pure Camp was destroyed by a tornado and killed two people on April 2, 1957. The camp closed permanently in July, 1959.

<text>New Woodville is a town in Marshall County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 60 as of the 2020 Census. Listed erroneously by the Census Bureau as &quot;Woodville&quot; from 1980 to 2000, the town&#x27;s name was corrected in Census Bureau listings in 2005. Proposals to annex the unincorporated areas of New Woodville and McBride on the shores of Lake Texoma were considered in the past. 

==History==
The original town of Woodville was established as Harney, with its post office opening November 8, 1881. It was renamed Woodville on July 9, 1888 in honor of local settler L.L. Wood. Construction of a St. Louis and San Francisco Railway affiliate through the area in 1900 stimulated growth, with the town having 3 newspapers, a grain elevator, and cotton gins, resulting in a community with a school and nine brick buildings. It was incorporated as a town between 1900 and 1907.
That original Woodville, having approximately 300 residents, was dissolved around 1943 or 1944 when the area was flooded due to the Red River being dammed by Denison Dam to create Lake Texoma. The town of New Woodville was incorporated, with around 50 of the former Woodville residents moving to the new location about two miles north of the original townsite. New Woodville disincorporated for brief periods in the late 90s or the early 2000s, but has legally existed since 2002 although the town government has been inactive.

The drought of 2013 reduced the level of Lake Texoma sufficiently to expose some of old Woodville&#x27;s foundations and storm cellars.

==Geography==
New Woodville is located at (33.968724, -96.654078).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

The town is southeast of Kingston, Oklahoma, just off Oklahoma State Highway 70A.

Armstrong Road, Durham Street, and Lee Ann Drive are north of the BNSF tracks which do not have a bypass because they do not connect to any other streets.

<doc id="130357" wikidata="Q3287025" url="?curid=130357" title="Adair, Oklahoma">
<text>Adair is a town in Mayes County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 790 at the 2010 census, compared to the figure of 704 recorded in 2000. Named for two prominent Cherokee brothers, the town was established in 1883. It opened a Cherokee school.

==History==
Adair is named after two Cherokee brothers, William Penn Adair, a politician and jurist, and Dr. Walter Thompson Adair. It was established on March 15, 1883, and incorporated in 1897. William Penn Adair lived in the area off and on for 17 years beginning in the late 1860s.

In the 1880s, a Cherokee school was started here. In 1907, shortly before statehood, the school began to admit white students.

==Dalton Gang Train Robbery==
In the most daring deed of the Dalton Gang to date, on July 14, 1892, eight members held up the Missouri-Kansas-Texas train at Adair, Indian Territory (IT).

As the train approached, four men approached the night operator at the station and ordered him to &quot;flag down&quot; the train. As the train pulled to a stand-still, two members of the gang boarded the engine while the others covered the conductor and train men. The station operator was taken to the express car, where he ordered the messenger inside to open up. When the messenger refused, the train&#x27;s fireman was ordered to break open the door with his pick. Once inside, the bandits were quick to rifle the safe of its contents.

The gang did not know that a special detachment of eight railroad guards was on the train, in an effort to prevent such robberies. In command was J. J. Kinney, chief of railroad detectives, and Capt. J. H. LaFlore, chief of the Cherokee Nation police. Realizing the robbery was underway, the guards got off the train opposite the depot, and had a brief gun battle with some of the bandits on that side.

Finished on the train, the bandits made their get-away through the town. Doctors W. L. Goff and Youngblood were sitting on the porch of the drug store near the depot. Both men were hit several times by stray shots; Dr Goff was fatally wounded. Also wounded were captains Kinney and LaFlore, but they recovered.

The railroad and express company offered rewards of $5,000 &quot;for the capture and conviction&quot; for each bandit in the robbery.

<text>Disney is a town in Mayes County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 311 at the 2010 census. The town is named for former Oklahoma U.S. Congressman Wesley E. Disney and has no affiliation with The Walt Disney Company or Walt Disney.

==Overview==
Disney is also known as &quot;Disney Island&quot; because it sits on an island at the southern shore of Grand Lake o&#x27; the Cherokees. Oklahoma State Highway 28 is the only road into and out of Disney. To get into Disney from the west, one must drive across the 1-mile long Pensacola Dam. To continue out of Disney, two more small dams with spillway gates must be crossed. The northern part of Disney is lake-front, the southern part bounded by a wide stream. The spillways from the two small dams join this stream.

Disney has a herd of &quot;island deer&quot; that, while wild and not kept in an enclosure, act more like dogs, strolling across main street (HwY 28) and nibbling on lawns, shrubs, and flowers.

There is a convenience store, a bait shop, a post office, two drive-ins, and a sporting goods / lake apparel store in the historic &quot;Dam Hotel&quot; building. There are also offices for construction firms, a gift shop, two churches, and a church camp facility.

When the dam was built in the early 1930s, Disney was a different place—hundreds of workers, bosses, engineers, truck drivers, and all the services a large workforce would require were based in and near Disney. The Rogers Cabins motel is the former &quot;superintendents&quot; quarters. About 10 WPA era rock cabins, remodeled as motel rooms, are available. It is one of the few, if not the only, hotels / B&amp;Bs, etc. on the southeast part of the lake. In the October 1938 issue of &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot; magazine, famed artist Thomas Hart Benton wrote and illustrated an article about Disney, titled &quot;Thirty-Six Hours in a Boom Town&quot;.

Disney&#x27;s growth is limited by the size of the island and the technical difficulties with bringing municipal services across the dams, so Disney has its own water plant, no public sewer system (all septic), and no natural gas service to houses.
The first church in Disney was built by William J Morrow. He worked on the Dam from start to finish, living there with his family.

The Picture in Scripture Amphitheater is 3.5 miles east of town, and on Fridays and Saturdays for several weeks during the summer presents the story of the apostle Paul.

<text>Locust Grove is a town in Mayes County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,423 at the 2010 census, a 4.2 percent increase over the figure of 1,366 recorded in 2000.

==History==
Locust Grove was the site of the Battle of Locust Grove, a small Civil War engagement on July 3, 1862, in which approximately 250 Union troops surprised and destroyed a similar-sized Confederate contingent, killing about 100 and capturing another 100 while sustaining only minimal losses. The escaping Confederates retreated toward Tahlequah, leading to a loss of morale and desertions among the Cherokee Confederate supporters.

A small community, named for the grove of locust trees where this battle took place, formed here, in the Cherokee Nation of Indian Territory. A post office was established here on March 26, 1873. Jim Bryan moved the post office to his store in 1908, after Oklahoma became a state and Mayes County was established. In 1910, Louie Ross bought the Bryan store and moved it to his father&#x27;s ranch house. The community of Locust Grove soon relocated closer to the store, and soon had a cemetery, a gristmill, two blacksmith shops, and a separate building to house the post office.

The existing townsite was established in 1912 by O.W. Killam, a lawyer, merchant, realtor and promoter who bought the Cherokee allotment that had belonged to Elzina Ross in connection with the construction of the Kansas, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway. Killam platted the townsite and incorporated it on March 4, 1913.

The town has had its share of tragedy. In June 1952, the county attorney Jack Burris was assassinated at his home at Locust Grove in one of the most famous unsolved murders in Oklahoma history. 
In 1977 it was the location of the Oklahoma Girl Scout murders, in which three young girls were raped and murdered as they were camping at the nearby Camp Scott Girl Scout facility. Gene Leroy Hart was arrested and tried for the crime, but found not guilty in a jury trial. The case remains open. Also, a popular restaurant, &quot;Country Cottage&quot;, was linked to a highly publicized August 2008 outbreak of &quot;E. coli&quot; O111, a rare strain of the bacterium. The outbreak resulted in more than 100 cases of gastrointestinal food poisoning and one death;
subsequent studies were unclear about the source of the bacteria, leading Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson to accuse the state health department of having &quot;botched&quot; the investigation.

Native American Cherokee sculptor Willard Stone lived near Locust Grove; a museum dedicated to his work is now located on the site.

Locust Grove is home to the Rural Oklahoma Museum of Poetry. There is only one other poetry museum in the U.S., the American Poetry Museum in Washington DC.

The Willard Stone Museum is currently at his homeplace in Locust Grove. The museum&#x27;s goal is to relocate to the historic building that housed the first bank in Locust Grove, located in downtown and built in 1912, to house the collection. In 2019, the museum&#x27;s board of directors authorized build-out of the new facility, and in September 2020 launched a fundraising campaign to finance the needed renovations.

Locust Grove is directly south of Lake Hudson, southwest of Lake W. R. Holway, formerly Chimney Rock Lake, and northeast of Fort Gibson Lake.

<text>Pensacola is a town in Mayes County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 125 at the 2010 census, which represented a 76 percent increase from the figure of 71 recorded in 2000.

==History==
The history of Pensacola began &quot;circa&quot; 1840, with the establishment of a way station on the old Texas Road at the Cabin Creek Crossing of the Grand River. Here, Joseph Lynch Martin (a.k.a. &quot;Greenbrier Joe&quot;) established a trading post called Pensacola.

The Union Army commandeered Pensacola as a supply station between Fort Scott, Kansas and Fort Gibson, Indian Territory. during the Civil War. Two battles between Union and Confederate forces occurred here, resulting in the destruction of Pensacola.

Greenbrier Joe&#x27;s son, Richard Martin, reestablished Pensacola in 1896, with a small store and a post office at his home, south of the original location.

In 1909, James Sims Wilson, a settler from Kentucky, established a ranch north of Pensacola and east of Grand River. The Missouri, Oklahoma &amp; Gulf Railroad came to this area in 1912. Its right of way crossed the Wilson ranch, and Wilson began planning a townsite that would be served by the Pensacola post office. He filed the Pensacola townsite plat in the office of the county clerk on April 2, 1912. Despite failure of the town bank in 1921 and the onset of the Great Depression, the announcement of a new dam project five miles east, there was hope for growth to return. A chamber of commerce formed, and the town incorporated in 1938.

Pensacola never became more than a small country town supported by farming and cattle ranching. It was surrounded on three sides by the Wilson ranch. Moreover, until the Pensacola Dam and good roads were completed in 1943, commerce was limited. The population declined from 109 in 1940 to 48 in 1950.

<doc id="130371" wikidata="Q2019260" url="?curid=130371" title="Pryor Creek, Oklahoma">
<text>Pryor Creek or Pryor is a city in and county seat of Mayes County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 8,659 at the 2000 census and 9,539 in the 2010 census.

Originally named &quot;Coo-Y-Yah&quot;, Cherokee for &quot;place of the huckleberries&quot;, it was renamed Pryor Creek in 1887 which was the name of the local railroad station, which in turn was named for the nearby creek. Due to confusion in distinguishing handwritten mailing addresses to Pryor Creek and Pond Creek, the U.S. Postal Service name for the city was shortened to Pryor, and both names are in common usage.

==History==

In the early 1800s, treaties with the Cherokee, Osage, and Choctaw gave the tribes allotments in Indian Territory in the region that would become Oklahoma. Captain Nathaniel Hale Pryor, who was married to an Osage woman and served as an agent to the Osage people, was among those settling northeastern Oklahoma. He established a trading post on Grand River, shortly before the Union Mission was established 5 miles southeast of present-day Chouteau in 1820.

Pryor Creek is along the path of the Texas Road cattle trail, and the later Jefferson Highway of the early National Trail System, both roughly along the route of U.S. Route 69 through Oklahoma today.

In 1870, the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad started construction in the Cherokee Nation along the Kansas border, laying tracks to Texas. By June 1871, the railroad reached present-day Pryor Creek.

A post office was eventually established naming the town &quot;Coo-y-yah&quot;, Indian Territory. Coo-y-yah is Cherokee for &quot;place of the huckleberries&quot;. On April 23, 1887, Coo-y-yah was changed to Pryor Creek, but the &quot;Creek&quot; was dropped by the post office on January 26, 1909. The official name of the city government is still Pryor Creek despite a proposition put before voters in 1963 to change the name officially to Pryor.

On April 27, 1942, a tornado swept along Pryor&#x27;s main street from the western edge of the business district to the eastern edge of the city, destroying nearly every building and causing extensive damage to the residential section. The storm killed 52 people, according to the U.S. Weather Bureau, but The Associated Press set the total at 60 two days after the storm. More than 400 were injured in the storm that caused damage estimated at US$3 million.

The F4 tornado struck about 5 p.m. (17:00) local time, an hour and a half after one hit near Talala, Oklahoma, and mowed a path about long, killing three and injuring 12. Talala, which was not hit, is about northwest of Pryor Creek. Governor Leon C. Phillips put the area under martial law, but because the Oklahoma National Guard had been activated for service during World War II, he sent state troopers to rescue victims, maintain order and prevent looting.

The Pryor tornado ranks as the fifth deadliest in Oklahoma history behind tornadoes at Woodward in 1947, Snyder in 1905, Peggs in 1920, and Antlers in 1945. The May 3, 1999, tornado at Midwest City caused more damage but fewer deaths.

In 1951, voters approved the present city charter of a mayor-council government system, which provided for the election of a mayor, clerk, treasurer, police chief and eight councilors. The charter also established a cemetery, park, library board, and a municipal utility board, which oversees operations of the city-owned gas, water, electric and sewer systems.

<text>Salina ( ) is a town in Mayes County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,396 at the 2010 census, a slight decline from the figure of 1,422 recorded in 2000.

==History==
For thousands of years indigenous peoples had lived along the rivers in this area, with varying cultures. By the time of European encounter, the Osage was a major tribe in the area. Their territory started at the Missouri River and extended west, including to parts of present-day Arkansas.

In 1541 the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto and expedition passed through the area, as did the 1721 expedition of Bernard de la Harpe. They gave Spanish names to many of the local streams, which the Osage had already named.

In 1796 Jean Pierre Chouteau, a French trader from St. Louis, established the first trading post in 1796 at the junction of the Grand/Neosho River and Saline Creek for business with the Osage. Remembered today as one of the first permanent &quot;white&quot; (European-American) settlements in present-day Oklahoma, at that time the area was part of the Spanish Louisiana. The United States took possession of the land that included Salina with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.

By 1817, keelboats were landing goods at Salina from Ft. Smith, Arkansas, and the area was considered part of what was known as &quot;Indian Territory&quot; of the United States. That year, Chouteau&#x27;s son Auguste Pierre and his partner Joseph Revoir received an exclusive license from Spanish authorities to trade with the Osage. In 1820, the Spanish government of the time took the monopoly away. Chouteau convinced the Osage tribe, under the leadership of &quot;Cashesgra&quot; (&quot;Big Trek&quot;), to migrate into Indian Territory near the trading post, and ensured the survival of the business.

In 1820, the United States Department of War authorized Epaphras Chapman to establish the Union Mission near the mouth of Chouteau Creek to educate and convert the Osage. The mission had the first printing press in present-day Oklahoma. Under its policy of Indian Removal, the US government began to remove Native American tribes from the Southeast, giving them land in the Territory in exchange.

The Indians boiled salt from the water rising from limestone rock about a mile south of the trading post. Springs included one hot water geyser that shot boiling water 8 to into the air. Chouteau obtained the springs in a treaty in 1825 and sold them to Sam Houston in 1830. A Cherokee, Captain John Rogers, began making salt from the springs and named them &quot;Grand Saline&quot;. He built his home nearby. Washington Irving visited on October 6, 1832, accompanied by Sam Houston. In 1838 the government began moving Cherokee to the area in implementation of the Indian Removal Act.

By 1839, Rogers was operating 115 salt kettles. He lost the salt works in 1844 to the Cherokee Nation under a new law defining their territory. The Cherokee leased the works to Lewis Ross (brother of Chief John Ross). Ross built a house there and operated the salt business using African American slave labor. Drilling for salt water, in 1859 Ross accidentally hit the first vein of oil in Indian Territory (Oklahoma). It flowed at the rate of 10 barrels a day for a year. He operated two stores in Salina.

In 1862 during the American Civil War, Union soldiers came down unopposed on the Grand River to Salina and set all slaves free. The soldiers ransacked the Ross home, had the slaves load everything on wagons, and hauled the goods across the border to the free state of Kansas. In 1872 the Cherokee Nation purchased the Ross home for $26,000 and used it for years as the Cherokee Orphan Asylum. It was destroyed by fire in 1899. Reconstructed, the structure is now used as a gym.

The Cherokee chief Samuel Houston Mayes established a ferry and mercantile business on the Grand River in 1906.

The establishment of the Old Chouteau Trading Post at Salina was commemorated on October 10–11, 1938 and has become an annual celebration. Among those speaking at the inaugural event were Governor-Elect Leon C. Phillips, Dr. M. L. Wardell of the University of Oklahoma, Mr. Thomas J. Harrison of Pryor, and Yvonne Chouteau, a descendant of Jean Pierre Chouteau.

==Historic Site==
The Spring House, off Oklahoma State Highway 20, is an NRHP-listed location, being one of the oldest existing properties in the state, and also being important for its association with Lewis Ross, brother of Cherokee chief John Ross. Lewis Ross settled in the area around 1838, building both a home and, in 1844, an octagonally-shaped spring house. The home later became an orphanage and was destroyed by fire in 1903, but the spring house survived.

<text>Spavinaw is a town in Mayes County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 437 at the 2010 census, a decline of 22.4 percent from the figure of 563 recorded in 2000. The town is best known as the birthplace of baseball player Mickey Mantle. It is also notable for the nearby Lake Spavinaw, the principal source of water for Tulsa.

==History==

The town is named for Spavinaw Creek, a stream named by French traders and explorers who travelled here in the 18th century. According to historian Muriel Wright, the French name was a corrupted form of the French word &quot;ce&#x27;pee&quot; (meaning &quot;young growth or shoots of wood&quot;). plus the French adjective &quot;vineux&quot; (wine colored). This term referred to a description of the color of black jack, post and red oak trees which grow here in springtime.

The first recorded settler here was Lewis Rogers, son of Captain John Rogers. Lewis set up a mill, a distillery and a salt works in 1829. In 1839, the Eastern Cherokee began moving into the Spavinaw area of Indian Territory. The Cherokee council outlawed the operation of distilleries in their area and dispossessed Rogers of his distillery and the salt works, both of which had already been damaged by a flooding of Spavinaw Creek.

In 1846, Jacob Croft, a Mormon en route to Utah, decided to settle here instead. He was hired by Joseph Lynch Martin to restore the mill. In 1855, a group of Mormon missionaries from Utah arrived at Croft&#x27;s home and began converting Cherokees and Creeks. When they began urging the converts to move to Utah, Lewis Rogers complained to the Cherokee council. In October 1856, Chief John Ross ordered all Mormons out of the Cherokee nation.

After the Civil War, Joseph &quot;Greenbrier Joe&quot; Lynch, brother-in-law of Joseph Lynch Martin, began operating the mill and the salt works. Greenbrier Joe had saved enough money to buy . The community that grew up around these works became known as Lynch&#x27;s Mill. In October 1878, the community was renamed Spavinaw Mills.

==Lake Spavinaw==

After the city of Tulsa began the Spavinaw Water Project in the 1920s, construction began on the Spavinaw Dam, which created Lake Spavinaw from Spavinaw Creek. The project submerged the site of the former Spavinaw Mills. The residents moved a short distance to found a new town called Spavinaw.

<text>Dibble is a town in McClain County, Oklahoma, United States. The population within city limits was 867 at the 2020 census, down from 878 at the 2010 census. The community has 8,868 residents in its 73031 zipcode, according to Sperling&#x27;s Best Places. Dibble is in the outer suburban area west of Purcell and southwest of Norman, in the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area, according to the U.S. Census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

Dibble is located along State Highway 39 just east of the State Highway 76 junction.

==History==
Dibble was incorporated in 1937.

In 1950 Dibble had a population of 148.

The town&#x27;s school system was first established in 1907

Located in western McClain County, Dibble lies just north of State Highway 39 and approximately one mile east of State Highway 76. For much of the nineteenth century the site of the present community existed in the Chickasaw Nation&#x27;s Pontotoc County. According to historian George Shirk, John and James Dibble operated a ranch in the area and contributed their name to the town. The town is also located near Dibble Creek. The ranch lay on the Fort Smith to Fort Sill military road and served as a stopping point for soldiers and travelers. The village may have been in existence as early as 1869, and the Post Office Department designated a Dibble post office in 1894 with Horatio Orem as postmaster.

In 1901 the &quot;Gazetteer and Business Directory of Indian Territory&quot; reported that Dibble had one hundred residents, a hotel, a grocery store, a general store, a blacksmith, a doctor, and three stockmen. Ranching served as the early economic staple, soon followed by farming. In 1902 J. T. Payne platted the townsite, which the Department of Interior approved in November of that year, withholding the land from the Chickasaw allotment process. In 1906, after the Oklahoma Central Railway failed to build through the town, placing its tracks eight miles north at Blanchard, the town lost many of its burgeoning businesses. In 1911 Polk&#x27;s &quot;Oklahoma Gazetteer&quot; estimated a Dibble population of 150 and listed two general stores, a confectioner, a blacksmith, a doctor, and a drugstore. In 1918 the population dropped to 125, but the town had added a gristmill, a cotton gin, and a feed store, reflecting the emphasis on farming.

In 1926 the post office discontinued. In 1936 the Works Progress Administration built an addition to the school, which educated children from the surrounding region. In 1937 State Highway 39 was completed adjacent to the community, allowing the school district to annex outlying rural schools. Also in 1937 the town incorporated, and in 1940 the population stood at 97. The school, area petroleum drilling, and agriculture supported Dibble for much of the twentieth century. In 1953 another post office began operation. The 1960 population was 127, climbing to 184 in 1970. In 1990 the town had 181 residents, which rose to 289 in 2000. That year there were 568 students enrolled in the Dibble School District. By 2010 the town had bloomed to 878 residents.

<text>Newcastle is a city in McClain County, Oklahoma, United States, and part of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area. The population was 10,984 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Newcastle became a dot on the map with the opening of a new post office March 26, 1894 and a population of 25. The area had previously been served by the nearby William P. Leeper Post Office, opened in 1888, but closed in 1892 after Leeper was shot in a range fencing dispute. The mail office was established on the Minco-to-Norman road in Section 11, Township 9 North, Range 4 West. Eulalie V. Kelley was the first postmaster. In 1905, postmaster Alonzo Haun moved the facility to his general store in Section 14, Township 9 North, Range 4 West.

Newcastle lay in the Chickasaw Nation. The community&#x27;s first residents included Choctaw, Chickasaw, and individuals who had married into those tribes. Many were involved in ranching. By 1907, the community had a subscription school, a cotton gin, two stores, and two blacksmiths.

Changes spurred Newcastle&#x27;s growth throughout the 1920s. In 1920 the town&#x27;s post office was relocated one mile east on land donated for a public school and a church. In 1922, work started on a South Canadian River bridge. The steel thru-truss bridge with timber flooring was Oklahoma&#x27;s first federal aid project and a part of the Ozark Trail that was to link Oklahoma City to Amarillo, Texas. Although the trail was never fully completed, the bridge stayed. It opened on April 23, 1923, and cost $321,393.38 to build. The bridge attracted businesses and allowed for the construction of Highway 62 through Newcastle in 1927.

Until the mid-twenties, there was a major river ford at May Avenue that was used whenever the water wasn&#x27;t too deep. Farmers from Newcastle forged the river with their horses and wagons and traveled up May Avenue on their way to the Oklahoma City Farmer&#x27;s Market by Western and Reno. Today, only a single section of the old Newcastle Bridge remains alongside the Interstate 44 bridge after having received significant damage during the 2013 tornado (see below).

During World War II, Newcastle&#x27;s population stood at approximately 100. During the war five local men gave their lives in defense of their country. Another was captured in the Philippines and spent more than three years as a Japanese prisoner. Soon after Japan surrendered, a tornado swept through Newcastle and destroyed the school and much of the business section. The twister touched down the evening of September 25, 1945, moving from the southwest to the northeast.

The limits of Newcastle essentially comprised the post office and school district until around 1960, when Oklahoma City began annexing huge chunks of land across the river. Incorporated January 18, 1962 as South Newcastle, it expanded its area to some 16,000 acres. Nearby Tuttle and Blanchard expanded as well to attempt to prevent Oklahoma City from trying to annex across the Canadian River. A petition to change the name to Newcastle followed in 1965.

Census records indicate a population of 1,271 in 1970, but by the mid-1970s, Oklahoma City had expanded past SW 74th Street, populating near the Interstate 44 corridor, which spurred growth in Newcastle. The population hit 3,076 in 1980 and 5,434 by 2000. In the 1980s, Newcastle annexed territory that lies near Norman, Oklahoma (north of State Highway 9).

Cotton, ranching, and the dairy industry, once important to the local economy, declined with subdivisions and commercial development taking over former agricultural lands. At the end of the twentieth century the public school system was Newcastle&#x27;s largest employer. The 2010 census recorded 7,685 residents and the population is estimated to be over 10,000 by 2020.

In January 2019, Newcastle was ranked 36th &quot;Best City to Live&quot; in the United States by 24/7 Wall St., which created a weighted index of over two dozen measures to identify the best city to live in each state.

===Tornadoes===
April 25, 1893, a massive tornado, reportedly over a mile and a quarter wide at one point, moved northeast along a 15-mile path from northwest of Newcastle through what now is part of Moore, and swept away at least 30 homes. Thirty-three people were killed with 11 people dying in one home, 6 in a second home and 4 in a third home. This tornado was one of at least 5 strong/violent tornadoes in central Oklahoma on this day, but the only one within the immediate Oklahoma City area. The local Norman paper reported that residents of Cleveland County were &quot;scared... as they never have been scared before.&quot; In addition, there was a &quot;general scampering from all parts and a hunt for caves was generally inaugurated.&quot;

On May 3, 1999, the F5 1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado struck parts of Newcastle and resulted in the destruction of several homes in the Newcastle city limits. Greater destruction occurred in Bridge Creek and Moore. This violent, long-lived tornado was the most infamous of nearly 60 tornadoes that struck central Oklahoma during an unprecedented outbreak.

On May 24, 2011, a tornado ripped through parts of Newcastle. There were an estimated 160 homes either damaged or destroyed and over 20 businesses damaged. However, there was no loss of life within the city.

On May 20, 2013, another violent tornado damaged parts of Newcastle, including the historic retired Ozark Trail Bridge, growing rapidly as it headed north crossing the Canadian River, and did a large amount of damage to neighboring Moore and southern Oklahoma City.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (1.16%) is water.

Newcastle is considered to be part of a rapidly growing area of northern McClain and Grady counties. Newcastle also is a part of an area known as the &quot;Tri-City Area&quot; with Tuttle and Blanchard. Newcastle also serves as the largest incorporated community in McClain County.

In &quot;Broken Bow&quot;, the 2001 pilot episode of the television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, Broken Bow was the site of Human–Klingon first contact in 2151. A messenger named Klaang was shot down by the Suliban over a corn field. Shortly after dispatching his enemies, Klaang was shot by a farmer named Moore. Although severely injured, Klaang survived.

Broken Bow and the surrounding area also served as the location for the episode &quot;19:19&quot; of the television series &quot;Millennium&quot;, in which Frank Black led a search for a group of children who had been abducted on their way to school. The abductor, a crazed visionary who believed he was the one destined to carry out the Book of Revelation&#x27;s instructions, entombed the children in an abandoned quarry. This ultimately saved them from a deadly tornado that destroyed the schoolhouse where they otherwise would have been.

Broken Bow is a location in the 2010 film &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;.

<text>Garvin is a town in McCurtain County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 256 at the 2010 census, compared to 143 in 2000.

==History==
Garvin began as a trading post in the Choctaw Nation, approximately southeast of the present community bearing the same name. A post office named Garvin was established at the trading post on February 19, 1894. James W. Kirk, owner of the trading post, was the first postmaster, and chose to name the post office &quot;Garvin,&quot; after his father-in-law, Isaac L. Garvin, who had been chief of the Choctaw Nation from 1878 to 1880.

At the time of its founding, Garvin was located in Bok Tuklo County, a part of the Apukshunnubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

In 1902, the Choctaw Land Commission selected a new site along the railroad that was being constructed across what would become McCurtain County, Oklahoma. The site, which would reclaim the name Garvin, was halfway between Valliant and Purnell (later renamed Idabel). The new Garvin began to develop rapidly. The first newspaper to serve that part of the country was the &quot;Garvin Graphic&quot;, which began publishing in 1903. A school opened in September 1904, with an enrollment of 50 students. A cotton gin began operation in the same year. In 1905, Garvin had a telephone system. Garvin had a population of 800 in 1906, 15 stores had opened by then and several professional people (e.g., doctors and lawyers) had established practices.

Statehood had caused the dissolution of the Choctaw Nation as a political entity, replaced by the creation of several counties of the new state of Oklahoma. Garvin fell within the boundaries of McCurtain County. Idabel was chosen as the county seat, although Garvin then had the larger population. Its economic base was forest products, because of the dense forests in its vicinity. The town had several wood processing businesses, creating job opportunities. There was a large sawmill, a veneering plant, a barrel hoop plant and a barrel stave plant. Whole logs could be shipped to other markets over several miles of a tramway that led south toward the Red River. Garvin&#x27;s population rose to a peak of 957 in 1910, then dropped to only 293 at the 1920 census. Garvin never regained its previous growth. Meanwhile, its local rival, Idabel had surged ahead to a 1910 population of 1,493 and continued growth, with a total of 3,067 residents in 1920.

<text>Idabel is a city in and the county seat of McCurtain County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 7,010 at the 2010 census. It is in Oklahoma&#x27;s southeast corner, a tourist area known as Choctaw Country.

==History==
Idabel was established in 1902 as a station by the Arkansas and Choctaw Railway. (This was later part of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway, and the line is now operated by the Kiamichi Railroad). 

The city was first named Purnell, after Isaac Purnell, a railroad official. When postal officials rejected that designation, the name was changed to Mitchell, honoring another railroad company officer. Postal officials rejected that name because another post office of the same name already existed elsewhere in the territory. They named the post office &quot;Bokhoma&quot; (a Choctaw word meaning Red River); it opened December 15, 1902. 

Railroad officials then chose the name Idabel, a compound of the names of Isaac Purnell&#x27;s two daughters, Ida and Bell. The post office was renamed as Idabel.

At the time of its founding, Idabel was located in Bok Tuklo County, a part of the Apukshunubbee District of the Choctaw Nation, within what was known as Indian Territory.

For the first four years, Idabel local government was conducted by the Choctaw tribe for its people. The federal government had legal jurisdiction in most matters over non-Choctaw. the Indians themselves. The national government was responsible for enforcing the law among non-Choctaws. In 1906, the citizens elected their first mayor and established a mayor-council form of government. 

At the time of statehood, November 16, 1907, the town was designated as the county seat of McCurtain County. A census in that year reported 726 residents. By 1910, the population had grown to 1,493. In 1920, there were 3,617 residents, but the number fell to 2,581 in 1930. Growth resumed by the end of the Great Depression in the late 1930s. 

The death of Henry Lee Johnson in 1980 resulted in a riot in the town that resulted in two deaths.

Idabel residents elected their first African-American mayor in April 2019, mayor Craig Young.

<text>Valliant is a town in McCurtain County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 754 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Valliant was founded June 2, 1902, in what was the Choctaw Nation, Indian Territory, and named for Frank W. Valliant, a chief divisional engineer for the Arkansas and Choctaw Railway then being constructed in the area. At the time of its founding, Valliant was located in Towson County, a part of the Apukshunnubbee District, one of three administrative super-regions comprising the Choctaw Nation.

A cotton gin opened in 1903, and continued operation until the 1930s. In 1904, the town incorporated and elected its first mayor. A newspaper began publishing in 1905. Before 1920, the community had two banks, three hotels and nearly 20 other businesses.

Dierks Forests, Inc., known until 1954 as the Dierks Lumber and Coal Company and originally known as Choctaw Lumber Co., was a timber harvesting and processing company primarily in Oklahoma and Arkansas which started with a purchase of forest in 1903 near Valliant. The company grew to own 1.75 million acres of timberland, making it one of the largest family-owned landholding entities in the United States before it was sold to the Weyerhaeuser Company in 1969.

Pine Creek Dam was built nearby in the 1960s to control flooding along the stream. Pine Creek Lake and the Pine Creek Wildlife Management Area, directly north of town, have attracted vacationers.

==Geography==

<text>Wright City is a town in McCurtain County, Oklahoma, United States, along the Little River. The population was 762 at the 2010 census, a decline of slightly more than 10 percent from the figure of 848 recorded in 2000. Wright City hosts one of the oldest continuous rodeos in Oklahoma, known as Little Cheyenne, held each July 1 through 4. In 1933 a few local cowboys started it as a rodeo, barbecue, and dance. Since 1935, the American Legion, William Wright Post Number 74, has sponsored the event.

Wright City was once home to a Weyerhaeuser plant; it closed permanently in mid March 2009 due to the slowed lumber industry. The company sold its cardboard product line to International Paper Corporation. Weyerhaeuser was Wright City&#x27;s economic power engine, and its closing affected 165 employees.

==History==
===Founding===
Wright City, formerly known as Bismark and Wright, is located northeast of Valliant and north of Little River on State Highway 98 in western McCurtain County. The Choctaw Lumber Company, a subsidiary of the Dierks Lumber and Coal Company, founded the town &quot;circa&quot; 1909 as the site for a major processing plant that utilized abundant timber harvested from the region&#x27;s virgin forests.

At the time of its founding, the community now known as Wright City was located in Towson County, a part of the Apukshunnubbee District, one of three administrative super-regions comprising the Choctaw Nation.

===Etymology===
On March 24, 1910, a post office charter was issued for Bismark, a name chosen by the Dierks brothers, the company founders, for a Nebraska town where they formerly operated a lumber outlet. The name of the town and post office changed to Wright during World War I because of public association of the Bismark name with that of the former German chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, despite the discrepancy in spelling.

The new name was chosen to honor William Wiley Wright, the county&#x27;s first war casualty. On May 18, 1920, the name was altered to Wright City.

===Company town===
The &quot;company town&quot; included a sawmill, planer, railroad maintenance shops, housing stores, a bank, hotel,The Choctaw motion picture theater, a high school with athletic teams known as the LumberJax, an ice factory, and provision for fire and police protection. The lumber conglomerate also provided land for construction of a school and churches. The company, then known as Dierks Forests, Inc., divested itself of residential and other properties unrelated to the primary mission on August 13, 1965. In 1966 the town incorporated and elected its first officials. No longer just a &quot;mill town,&quot; citizens took the initiative to create an independent, distinctive municipality. A business district was developed, utilities were upgraded and expanded, and new schools, a community building, and a medical center were built.

In 1969, the Weyerhaeuser Company of Tacoma, Washington, purchased the Dierks&#x27;s holdings, including the Wright City production complex and continued the operations, which remained the primary economic base of the community until March 2009 when all operations of the mill ceased due to low demand for lumber and the worsening economy. The town population initially was included in a large census tract and not counted separately until 1950 when the residents numbered 1,121. In the 1920s the population was estimated to be less than five hundred. In 1980 the count stood at 1,168 but by 1990 had decreased to 836. At the turn of the twenty-first century the town had 848 residents. The 2010 census showed a further decline to 766.

===&quot;Pig tale&quot;===
In 1956, events in the city raised the eyebrows of newspaper readers around the country. A drought drove pig-herding squatters from nearby hills to release seven or eight hundred hogs - all of them &quot;rail thin&quot; and starving - to graze near the city. Razorbacks ate flower gardens and had to be kicked out of the drugstore. In the Methodist Church, a sermon was stopped by the noise of nine pigs fighting in the basement.

Between 1907 and 1909, the people of Checotah were involved in a dispute with nearby Eufaula known as the McIntosh County Seat War. After Checotah was designated as the new county seat, the people of Eufaula refused to hand over the county records. Soon after, a group of heavily armed men from Chectotah attempted to seize the records from the courthouse in Eufaula, but were beaten back and forced to surrender during the gunfight that followed. Eufaula was designated as the permanent seat of McIntosh County one year later.

<text>Eufaula is a city in and the county seat of McIntosh County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 2,813 at the 2010 census, an increase of 6.6 percent from 2,639 in 2000. Eufaula is in the southern part of the county, north of McAlester and south of Muskogee.

The name &quot;Eufaula&quot; comes from the Eufaula tribe, part of the Musogee Creek confederacy. The town and county are within the jurisdiction of the federally recognized Muscogee Nation, descendants of the tribe who were removed here from the Southeastern United States in the 1830s.

== History ==

In the Southeast, the Musogee people (then known as Creek by European Americans) occupied a large territory including much of present-day Georgia and Alabama. By 1800, the Creek had a village named Eufala, located on Eufaula Creek, near what later developed as the present site of Talladega, Alabama. This was one of a group called their Upper Creek towns. Pickett&#x27;s &quot;History of Alabama&quot; mentions an Indian town, belonging to the Creek, which he calls &quot;Eufaulahatche.&quot; Little Eufauly is mentioned by an historian of this period as early as 1792. Another Upper Creek town called Eufaula was located on the Tallapoosa River; the present town of Dadeville, Alabama developed near there.

The Lower Creek had two villages of similar names: Eufaula on the Chattahoochee River, in what later became Henry County, Alabama; and Eufala, located on the east bank of the Chattahoochee River, within the limits of present Quitman County, Georgia.

In 1832 the U. S. Government had forced the Creek to move to Indian Territory and cede their lands in the Southeastern United States, as part of a series of cessions they had made. They established Eufaula as a center of Creek in their new territory. It was a frequent meeting place of the people, who held pow-wows or Indian conferences in that vicinity during the early days of Creek settlement.

In the 1870s G. W. Grayson, then Chief of the Creek, his brother Samuel, George Stidham and other Creek leaders, persuaded the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railway (known as the KATY) to locate one of its stations at this site. The older Creek village was moved here to take advantage of the railroad.

Eufaula, Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma), began to attract European Americans soon after the KATY railroad established a station here in 1872. The town was named after George W. Ingall, US Indian agent for the Five Civilized Tribes, suggested the name Eufaula, after the earlier Muscogee tribal town in Alabama. Eufaula incorporated as a town in Indian Territory by 1898.

D. B. Whitlow and Joseph Coody established the first store on the west side of the railroad. The Graysons and G. E. Seales started a store on the east side about the same time. Dr. W. H. Bailey was the first physician and druggist to locate in the new town. Rev. R. C. McGee, a Presbyterian missionary, established one of the first churches in Eufaula. He served there as minister for many years. For years before the American Civil War, the Asbury Mission School, located two miles northeast of Eufaula, was the leading educational institution of that vicinity. It was burned in an accidental fire.

==20th century to present==
After Oklahoma was admitted as a state, Eufaula was part of the newly organized McIntosh County. The residents of Eufaula were involved in a dispute with nearby Checotah, in what was known as the McIntosh County Seat War, during 1907 and 1909. The legislature had designated Checotah as the new county seat, but the people of Eufaula refused to hand over the county records. Soon after, a group of heavily armed men from Checotah tried to seize the records from the courthouse in Eufaula, but were beaten back and forced to surrender during a gunfight. One year later, Eufaula was designated as the permanent seat of McIntosh County.

===Education===
The European-American settlers of Eufaula built a school on the east side of the railroad, and established a free school by voluntary taxation. When the Curtis Act was passed by Congress, Eufaula levied taxes and started to build their public school system, and to make other needed public improvements. In the early 20th century, the city had paved streets, a splendid &quot;White Way,&quot; five brick-and-stone schoolhouses, seven churches, a large cotton oil mill, light and ice plant, business blocks, three parks, a waterworks and sewage system, four banks, two hotels, the three-story brick boarding school for Creek Nation girls, and an abundance of natural gas for domestic and commercial purposes. A civic club worked to improve the town.

===Jefferson Highway Bridge===
When the Jefferson Highway was first constructed through Eufaula, travelers and trade vehicles could cross the South Canadian River, about four miles below the town, only by ferry. The citizens of Eufaula incorporated The Jefferson Highway Bridge Company, and constructed the Jefferson Highway Bridge, at a cost of almost a quarter of a million dollars. When built, the bridge was the most expensive constructed on the Jefferson Highway between Winnipeg, Canada and New Orleans. It opened for use April 21, 1920. The bridge is now long gone, and the site of the bridge has changed with the building of Lake Eufaula.

===Eufaula Business District===
The historic Eufaula Business District is on the National Register of Historic Places listings in McIntosh County, Oklahoma. The District is officially described as the: &quot;Area within Lots 89, 90, 100, 101, 102 on Main Street between Pine and Grand Streets.&quot;

===McIntosh County Courthouse===
The McIntosh County Courthouse at 110 N. First St. is also on the National Register of Historic Places listings in McIntosh County, Oklahoma. The three-story, red brick building with the second floor entryway is said to be significant because it is a good example of the functional architectural design used for numerous public buildings in the state.

===Other NRHP Sites===
Other NRHP sites in Eufaula include the C.L. Cooper Building, the Eufaula Armory, and the First Soil Conservation District Dedication Site.

<text>Sulphur is a city in and county seat of Murray County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 5,065 at the 2020 census, a 2.8 percent gain over the figure of 4,929 in 2010. The area around Sulphur has been noted for its mineral springs, since well before the city was founded late in the 19th century. The city received its name from the presence of sulfur in the water.

==History==
This area was part of Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation in the Indian Territory during the late 19th century. The first known settler was Noah Lael, son-in-law of former Chickasaw Governor Cyrus Harris, who built a ranch south of Pavilion Springs in 1878. In 1882, Harris sold the ranch to Perry Froman, a part Chickasaw rancher. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot; says the ranch house was the first residence in Sulphur.

About 1890, a group of fisherman built a clubhouse at the Sulphur site. Conventions and other gatherings began meeting in the vicinity during the early 1890s. The clubhouse owners enlarged the building and sold it for use as a hotel. Richard A. Sneed, a lawyer who visited the area about 1890 and soon after organized the Sulphur Springs Company. The company bought of land from Froman Ranch and platted a townsite. A post office named Sulphur was established October 2, 1895. The &quot;Sulphur Headlight&quot;, the first newspaper in town, began publication in 1899, and the first telephone exchange in town went into service in 1900.

In the late Spring of 1903, the Sulphur Springs Railway was completed between Sulphur and Scullin, a distance of about , connecting at Scullin to the newly completed St. Louis and San Francisco Railway (Frisco). The Frisco bought the Sulphur Springs Railway in 1907.

In 1902, the U.S. Government and the Chickasaw Nation agreed to preserve the area around the springs, and called it the Sulphur Springs Reservation, later renaming it as Platt National Park. People and buildings were required to move out of the reservation area. The people resettled nearby, creating two communities, West Sulphur and East Sulphur, divided by Rock Creek. Another such move occurred in 1904, when the U.S, government decided to add another to the new park. The reservation officially opened to the public on April 29, 1904. Platt National Park was abolished by Congress and made part of the much larger Chickasaw National Recreation Area (CNRA) in 1976, which included Lake of the Arbuckles.

Sulphur defeated Davis, Oklahoma in an election in 1908 to determine the location of the county seat of the newly created Murray County.

A tornado touched down just northwest of the town on May 9, 2016. It was rated EF3 and did severe damage to homes and trees in the area.

Late at night on April 27, 2024, the city was hit by a significant tornado as part of a much larger tornado outbreak that impacted southern and northern parts of Oklahoma. A second, potentially large and or violent tornado passed through later. There was one confirmed fatality in Sulphur, and the majority of the town suffered substantial damage as a direct hit of the tornado.

<text>Haskell is a city, as of March 2024, in Muskogee County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 2,007 at the 2010 census, a gain of 13.7 percent over the figure of 1,765 recorded in 2000. Haskell was established in 1904 on the Midland Valley Railroad. It was named for town site developer Charles N. Haskell, who would become the first governor of the State of Oklahoma in 1907.

==History==
Haskell was founded about one and a half miles northeast of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation town of &quot;Sawokla,&quot; which already had a post office, a store and a cotton gin. Sawokla was a Hitchiti town and had been the home of Creek Chief Samuel Checote. The original tract had been allotted to Amos Rolland, a member of the Creek Nation. The store and gin relocated from Sawokla to Haskell as soon as the railroad was completed in 1904. The first store, S. Beshara and Brothers, was started in a tent by two immigrants from Syria. Haskell&#x27;s first post office was established in 1902, with Nat Lambertson, owner of a new hardware and general store, appointed as first postmaster. Other early businesses were C. E. Henson&#x27;s general store and A. J. Englert&#x27;s mill and elevator. The Haskell National Bank was organized in 1904, soon followed by the First National Bank, the International Bank, and the Arkansas Valley Bank. In the early 1990s, the town appointed Charlie B. White, a native son, its first black mayor. He died on March 17, 2013.

 The railroad enabled farmers near Haskell to ship their produce (grain, hay, corn, melons and cotton) to northern and eastern markets. Haskell counted 720 residents at the time of statehood in 1907. The Robertson Memorial Presbyterian Church, named for a noted missionary family who had lived in the area, was built in 1909. The President of Henry Kendall College came from Muskogee to preside over the dedication. The building is still in use in the 21st century.

Gas and oil were discovered near Haskell in 1910. This sparked a period of prosperity, and Haskell soon could boast of improvements such as paved streets, concrete sidewalks, electric lights, natural gas lines, and water works.

Completion of the Tulsa-Muskogee Turnpike in 1969 bypassed Haskell and diverted much road traffic from U.S. Highway 64. This caused a significant loss of revenue for many businesses in town.

In March 2024 by a vote of the citizens, Haskell changed from a Town to a City Manager form of Government.

<text>Muskogee () is the 13th-largest city in Oklahoma and is the county seat of Muskogee County. Home to Bacone College, it lies approximately southeast of Tulsa. The population of the city was 36,878 as of the 2020 census, a 6.0% decrease from 39,223 in 2010.

==History==

French fur traders were believed to have established a temporary village near the future Muskogee in 1806, but the first permanent European-American settlement was established in 1817 on the south bank of the Verdigris River, north of present-day Muskogee.

After the passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830 under President Andrew Jackson, the Muscogee Creek Indians were one of the &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot; forced out of the American Southeast to Indian Territory. They were accompanied by their slaves. The Indian Agency, a two-story stone building, was built here in Muskogee. It was a site for meetings among the leaders of the Five Civilized Tribes. Today it serves as a museum. At the top of what is known as Agency Hill, it is within Honor Heights Park on the west side of Muskogee.

In 1872, the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad was extended to the area. A federal court was established in Muskogee in 1889, around the same time that Congress opened portions of Indian Territory to non-Native settlers via land rushes. The city was incorporated on March 19, 1898.

Ohio native Charles N. Haskell moved to the city in March 1901. He was instrumental in building on the land rush; he stimulated expansion of the city of more than 4,000 people to a center of business and industry by 1910, with a population of more than 25,000 inhabitants. Haskell built the first five-story business block in Oklahoma Territory; he built and owned fourteen brick buildings in the city. Most importantly, he organized and built most of the railroads running into the city, which connected it to other markets and centers of population, stimulating its business and retail, and attracting new residents.

As Muskogee&#x27;s economic and business importance grew, so did its political power. In the years before the territory was admitted as a state, the Five Civilized Tribes continued to work on alternatives to keep some independence from European Americans. They met together on August 21, 1905, to propose the State of Sequoyah, to be controlled by Native Americans. They met in Muskogee to draft its constitution, planning to have Muskogee serve as the state&#x27;s capital. The proposal was vetoed by US President Theodore Roosevelt and mostly ignored by Congress; the proposed State of Sequoyah was never authorized. The US admitted the State of Oklahoma to the Union on November 16, 1907, as the 46th state.

Muskogee was the operational headquarters of the Muskogee Roads, four regional rail carriers under common management. The first was the Midland Valley Railroad, chartered in 1903. The three carriers surviving until 1963 were sold to the Texas &amp; Pacific, which was a subsidiary of the Missouri Pacific Railroad.

Muskogee was on the route of the Jefferson Highway established in 1915. That road ran more than , from Winnipeg, Manitoba, to New Orleans, Louisiana.

Muskogee attracted national and international attention when, in May 2008, voters elected John Tyler Hammons as mayor. Nineteen years old at the time of his election, Hammons is among the youngest mayors in American history.

==Geography==

Muskogee lies in the Arkansas River Valley and has a low, sea-level elevation compared to much of the rest of the state. The city is on the boundary of the oak and hickory forest region of eastern Oklahoma and the prairie, Great Plains region of northeastern Oklahoma. It is a suburban community of Tulsa.

The city&#x27;s climate is considerably warmer and more humid than other parts of the state.

=== Floods ===
Muskogee is a soft spot for floods. In May 2019, waters rose more than 42 feet on the Arkansas River. Those levels had not been reached since 1943 (although 1986 came close with water 39.6 feet high). The U.S.S. &quot;Batfish&quot; docked at the city&#x27;s military harbor broke free on the river. Two barges filled with tons of phosphate broke loose and threatened to break the dam they were heading towards. Webber Falls was ordered to evacuate immediately.

==Meteorite fall of January 20, 2023==
On January 20, 2023, at 3:38 AM CST, a slow-moving fireball lit up the sky over Eastern Oklahoma. An accompanying sonic boom was heard by many witnesses in the Oklahoma cities of Bixby, Broken Arrow, Coweta, Wagoner and as far away as Fayetteville, Arkansas. The resulting shockwave shook houses in the affected area, many people reported. Local television station KJRH stated, &quot;Multiple surveillance videos captured the meteor&#x27;s sights and sounds early Friday morning.&quot; Numerous videos of the event were later posted to social media. The meteor survived to relatively low altitudes, breaking apart soon thereafter, raining down numerous meteorite fragments that ultimately reached the ground. Meteorite enthusiasts from around the country quickly converged on the strewnfield, which was scientifically determined to be in an around the Muskogee area. Reality television meteorite hunter Steve Arnold told reporter Jeanette Quezada of KJRH, &quot;We&#x27;re out here hunting…we&#x27;re finding rocks.&quot;

<text>Taft is a town in Muskogee County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 174 as of the 2020 Census. The locale began as an all-black town on land allotted to Creek Freedmen. It is named for President William Howard Taft.

==History==
This community began as an all-black town on land allotted to freedmen of the Creek Nation. It was originally named Twine, for William H. Twine, and had a post office by 1902. Mr. Twine moved to Muskogee, and the citizens voted to rename the town as Taft, for President William Howard Taft, who was then Secretary of War in the Theodore Roosevelt administration.

Educational and correctional facilities have long been the town&#x27;s leading employers. These have included: W. T. Vernon School (1908), the Industrial Institute for the Deaf, Blind, and Orphans of the Colored Race (1909), Moton High School, and the State Training School for Negro Girls.

<text>Webbers Falls is a town in southeastern Muskogee County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 616 at the 2010 census, a decline of 14.9 percent from the figure of 724 recorded in 2000.

The name comes from a seven-foot waterfall in the Arkansas River named in honor of Walter Webber, a Cherokee chief who established a trading post here in 1818. He was a leader among the Western Cherokee, also called &quot;Old Settlers&quot;. They had a treaty with the United States government by 1828, which helped settle some conflicts with the Osage people, who had been forced to give up land to the Cherokee.

In the late 1830s and 1840, the mass of thousands of Cherokee from the Southeast were forcibly moved into Indian Territory as a result of the US policy of Indian Removal.

==History==
Webber had settled here with some of the first Cherokee to go to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River; it was then considered part of Arkansas Territory. Having acquired a small fleet of keelboats, he was able to stock the post with goods from other parts of the United States, so he opened a trading post and a portage service, as well as building a house. Of mixed-race Cherokee-European descent, Webber was married to a full-blood Cherokee. They had adopted many American ways and outfitted their house in European-American style. When English-speaking visitors came, one of their African-American slaves and domestic servants would translate. Webber also built a salt works, leasing the land for the latter from the Cherokee government, which held it communally as a tribe. In the early years when Webber was in the territory, there was considerable conflict with the Osage people, who were forced by the United States government to give up some of their territory to the Cherokee, in a Treaty of 1828.

Webber was among the early leaders of the Cherokee in this area, one of their representatives when meeting with US agents and going to Washington, DC for meetings. The Western Cherokee resisted sharing their territory with immigrants to be resettled from the Southeast, as the US government proposed in 1834. They finally agreed that year, in exchange for an increased amount of land and annuities.

In the late 1830s and 1840, the mass of thousands of Cherokee from the Southeast were forcibly moved into Indian Territory as a result of the US policy of Indian Removal. According to the Webbers Falls Historical Museum, this is the second-oldest town in the former Indian Territory.

Joseph Vann, a/k/a &quot;Rich Joe&quot; Vann, was among the thousands of Cherokee emigrants forced from Georgia during Indian Removal. He settled nearby and established a plantation, where he worked some of his more than 200 slaves he brought with him. At his direction, slaves built a house here that was a replica of his former antebellum mansion in Georgia, the Chief Vann House. This area was within the reservation of the Cherokee Nation.

A post office opened at Webbers Falls in 1856.

===1842 Slave Revolt===

On November 15, 1842, more than 25 slaves revolted in the largest action and escape in Cherokee territory. Mostly from Joseph Vann&#x27;s and his father&#x27;s plantations, the slaves locked masters and overseers in houses and cabins, stole guns and ammunition, horses and mules, food, and other supplies, then started traveling south. Their goal was to reach Mexico, where they knew slavery had been abolished. They picked up about 10 slaves in Creek territory along the way, and later freed a family of eight slaves from two slavecatchers, killing the latter.

After the first pursuers returned for reinforcements, the Cherokee National Council ordered about 87 men of the Cherokee Militia, under Captain John Drew, to apprehend the fugitives. The militia caught up with the fleeing slaves north of the Red River on November 28. The militia returned the fugitives to Tahlequah on December 8. Five were executed for having killed two slavecatchers they encountered to free a fugitive slave family from the Choctaw reservation. Vann put his surviving slaves to work as laborers and coal stokers on his steamboats.

===Civil War===
Cherokee Confederate General Stand Watie established a headquarters at Webbers Falls during the Civil War. In 1863, Union troops tried to capture Watie, but failed. Before leaving, they burned the town, including Vann&#x27;s antebellum home.

===20th century===
In 1907, Brewer&#x27;s Academy opened as the first school. Named for Oliver Hazard Perry Brewer, a local politician who had served as the Cherokee Nation&#x27;s Superintendent of Education in 1870 and 1876, and as the Board of Education President in 1881.

The town suffered a major fire that destroyed much of the business district in 1911. It was rebuilt in the following year, with the new structures mostly constructed of brick. These still stand.

The town got a rail line to Warner, Oklahoma in 1911 courtesy of the Webbers Falls, Shawnee and Western Railroad. That railway, which connected to the Midland Valley Railroad at Warner, ceased operations in 1914, was reorganized as the Webbers Falls Railroad in 1916, but was dismantled by 1918.

Construction in 1970 of the Webbers Falls Lock and Dam created Webbers Falls Reservoir and Robert S. Kerr Lock and Dam, created the Robert S. Kerr Reservoir, both part of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System (MKARNS), operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It has boosted the local economy by attracting outdoor enthusiasts for recreation opportunities. The town population increased 57 percent between 1980 and 2000, from 461 to 726. However, the population declined significantly by 2010.

===21st century===
The I-40 Bridge Disaster happened on May 26, 2002; a barge collided with a bridge support near Webbers Falls, causing a 580-foot section of the I-40 bridge to plunge into the Robert S. Kerr Reservoir on the Arkansas River. Automobiles and semi-trucks fell into the water, killing 14 people (including a three-year-old girl) and two horses. The bridge was repaired within two months, and reopened to traffic on July 29, 2002.

On May 22, 2019, two barges loaded with fertilizer broke loose from Muskogee County and were heading to Webbers Falls Lake. They were part of a tow that had been docked along the river because of the extremely high water level and the speed of the current. On the morning of May 23, 2019, the barges got stuck on some rocks and were later secured but, at around 10:40 AM the barges were on the loose after a helicopter attempted to safely secure the barges and around noon that same day hit the dam, which caused minor damage to the structure, but destroyed flood gates 7,8,and 9. The barges suffered major damage as they overturned and dumped their cargo into the flood, then sank to the base of the dam. Since the lake level had to be lowered significantly before the mangled barges could be removed, the flood gates could not be safely removed and the damaged gates repaired. This restricted traffic through the McClellan–Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System until late October 2019.

==Geography==

<text>Marland is a town in Noble County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 225 at the 2010 census. It was named for Ernest W. Marland, an oilman from nearby Ponca City who later became a governor of Oklahoma. Marland is on SH-156, south-southwest of Ponca City.

==History==
Marland began as a community named &quot;Bliss,&quot; a shipping point on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (often called simply the Santa Fe). The surrounding countryside, formerly part of the Ponca reservation, had been leased for cattle grazing and was part of the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch. The brothers built stockyards adjacent to the railroad on the south side of their ranch for shipping cattle. A community began forming nearby, with grain elevator, a lumber yard and a general store. The Millers platted a town on the east side of the tracks in 1906 and began selling lots.

In 1917, the Millers decided to move the town to the other side of the tracks, about north. The population continued to grow, reaching 250 residents.

In the 1920s, oil discovered by Ernest W. Marland in the nearby Three Sands Field helped the town, leading to the April 1922 election and town name change to Marland. But the Great Depression of the 1930s bankrupted the Miller Brothers ranch, and the Three Sands Field went dry, stunting further town growth.

<text>Morrison is a town in southeastern Noble County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 733 at the 2010 census, an increase from the figure of 636 in 2000.

==History==
Morrison is located in the former Cherokee Outlet, which was created for the Cherokee Nation in 1835 from former Osage hunting grounds. The Outlet was opened to non-Indian settlement by the Cherokee Strip Land Run in September 1893. The Morrison community emerged in 1894 on land that was once the Osage tribe&#x27;s hunting grounds.

Roselda Morrison, wife of James Morrison, owned the land upon which the town emerged. Nearby, a man named Autry (for whom the township was named) built a store, which received a postal designation as Autry in 1893. The post office was renamed Morrison in February 1894, after James Morrison bought the store. Morrison donated for a town, which was surveyed and platted in August 1894. The town of Morrison incorporated on August 13, 1894.

The Morrison business district moved a short distance south in 1902, when the Arkansas Valley and Western Railroad (after 1907 a part of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway system, or Frisco,) surveyed its Tulsa-Pawnee-Perry-Enid line. The railroad laid its tracks through the town in the same year. With railroad access, Morrison became an agricultural center, serving ranchers and wheat farmers.

Morrison&#x27;s economy was enhanced when oil prospectors discovered large natural gas fields in Pawnee County, east of Morrison, between 1915 and 1919. These were the largest fields discovered in Oklahoma up until that time. Pipelines collected the gas and moved it to Oklahoma City. Oil was discovered north of Morrison in 1923. These discoveries protected the town from the post-World War I agricultural depression that affected many other Oklahoma farm towns.

<text>Perry is a city in, and county seat of, Noble County, Oklahoma, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 5,126, a 2.0 percent decrease from the figure of 5,230 in 2000. The city is home of Ditch Witch construction equipment manufacture.

==History==
===19th century===
The Treaty of New Echota, May 23, 1836, assigned the Cherokee Outlet to the Cherokees as a perpetual outlet to use for passage to travel and hunt in the West from their reservation in the eastern part of what became Oklahoma. This was in addition to the land given to the Cherokees for settlement after their arrival from their home in Georgia.

Perry&#x27;s original name was Wharton, the name of a train station built in 1886 by the Southern Kansas Railway (part of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway system) about 1 mile south of the present city and it was located within the Outlet. Before the 1893 Cherokee Outlet Opening, the U.S. government selected a site a mile north of Wharton for a land office. A town around the office was named after J.A. Perry, a man sent by the government to lay out land office towns. Perry later became one of the township location commissioners. Noble County, then known as &quot;County P&quot;, was named after John Willock Noble of St. Louis, the Interior Secretary for President William Henry Harrison.

The Dalton Gang, which at that time included Bob Dalton, Emmett Dalton, Charlie Bryant and George Newcomb entered Wharton to rob a train in May 1891 earning $1745. Shortly after the robbery, Bryant fell ill and was taken to Hennessey to see a doctor. After being spotted and arrested by Deputy Marshal Ed Short. During an escape attempt Bryant and Short would kill each other. Among those within the boundary of the Strip prior to the opening, were the notorious Bill Doolin gang. A Santa Fe train was robbed at Wharton before the opening, and the gang escaped into Osage County. U.S. Marshall E.D. Nix and 100 deputies were commissioned to police the area and keep order.
At noon on September 16, 1893, &quot;a run&quot; for land within &quot;the Strip&quot; was opened. An estimated 90,000 men, women, and children took part and by nightfall 40,000 had erected tents in Perry. Jack Tearney started at the county line and reached Perry within 31 minutes. By 4:00 p.m. he had erected and opened the &quot;Blue Bell&quot; saloon selling beer the first day for $1.00 a bottle, due to the scarcity of water. He would sell 38,000 glasses.

Named &quot;Hell&#x27;s Half Acre&quot;, the original town&#x27;s perimeter included A &amp; F streets and 1st and 9th streets. About 110 saloons and gambling houses were in operation with many of them set up 1/2 block east of the west side of the now existing square.

Perry incorporated on September 20, 1893.

===20th century===
In 1902, Carl Malzahn, a German immigrant, moved to Perry and opened the Malzahn Blacksmith Shop with his sons, Charles (Charlie) and Gus. The sons took over the business in 1913 and renamed it Malzahn Brothers&#x27; General Blacksmithing, specializing in repairing equipment for the nearby oil fields. After Gus died in 1928, the surviving brother renamed the business, Charlie’s Machine Shop. Charlie&#x27;s son, Ed, a mechanical engineer, joined the business in 1944. Ed noticed a need for a machine to replace hand digging trenches for the installation of residential utility lines, and set to work developing such a device. By 1948, he had a successful device, a compact trencher, which he called the Ditch Witch. Soon, Ditch Witch became a successful company, wholly owned by the now-renamed Charles Machine Works Company, since 2019 a subsidiary of The Toro Company. It has grown into the largest employer in Perry and in Noble County, employing approximately 1,300 people.

Timothy McVeigh was stopped on April 19, 1995, along Interstate 35 outside of Perry by Oklahoma Highway Patrol Trooper Charlie Hanger. Trooper Hanger had passed McVeigh&#x27;s yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis and noticed it had no license plate. He arrested McVeigh for carrying a loaded firearm. Three days later, while still in jail, McVeigh was identified as the subject of a nationwide manhunt for the perpetrator of the Oklahoma City bombing, which had happened on the day of McVeigh&#x27;s arrest.

===21st century===
Perry moved from a strong mayor form of government to a Home Rule Charter. The town is in the process of transitioning to a City Manager. 

Operating under the Home Rule Charter form of government, the City of Perry divides its responsibilities between the city council and the city manager. The city council acts as the legislative branch, establishing ordinances, setting policy, authorizing budgets, and directing the city manager when appropriate. The city manager oversees day-to- day operations and administration of the city. Together with city staff, the city manager and city council work to make the most efficient use of the limited resources available to the City of Perry.

It is the smallest town in Oklahoma with a daily newspaper.

<text>Nowata (Lenape: &#x27;,&#x27; ) is a city and county seat of Nowata County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 3,731 at the 2010 United States census, a 6.0 percent decline from the figure of 3,971 recorded in 2000. The area where it was established was then part of the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory.

==History==
The first community established at this site was named Metz, named for its first postmaster, Fred Metzner. The name was changed even before the railroad was built in 1889.
Nowata served as a train stop for Native Americans from the East being forced to resettle by the United States government. Some controversy exists about the meaning of the town name. Lenape tribesmen who passed through named it &quot;nuwita,&quot; meaning &quot;friendly&quot; or &quot;welcome.&quot; In the Cherokee language, the town is called ᎠᎹᏗᎧᏂᎬᎬ (&quot;A-ma-di-ka-ni-gunh-gunh&quot;, roughly), which means, &quot;water is all gone,&quot; translating what it &quot;sounded&quot; like the word meant: No Water.

In 1889, the Kansas and Arkansas Valley Railway (later part of the Missouri Pacific Railway) built a line through Nowata. A post office was established in the town on November 8, 1889. Nowata was incorporated April 17, 1899. By 1900, Nowata had 498 residents.

Oil and gas were discovered nearby in 1904, stimulating the Nowata economy. The find established Nowata as &quot;...a region (having) a reputation for being the world&#x27;s largest shallow oil field.&quot; Some wells in this field have continued to produce into the twenty-first century.

A Federal court was established in 1904, and met on the third floor of the new building owned by the First National Bank of Nowata. The building housing the court burned down in 1909, destroying all records and forcing the court to move temporarily to another building. When Oklahoma became a state on November 16, 1907, Nowata County was created and named for the city, which was designated as the county seat. By that time, the city population had climbed to 2,233. A permanent Nowata County Courthouse was completed in 1912, and remains in use at present. It is the only local property listed on the National Record of Historic Places.

On September 29, 1916, two men, accused of killing a deputy sheriff, were taken from the Nowata jail by a mob and lynched in front of the courthouse.

Nowata&#x27;s peak population was 4,435 in 1920. It became the southern terminus of the Union Electric Railway, which continued to serve the city until 1948. Newspapers included the &quot;Nowata Herald&quot; and the &quot;Nowata Advertiser&quot;. The town had 850 telephones by 1930, when the census showed its first population decline, to nearly the 1910 level.

==Geography==
Nowata is north of Tulsa and south of the Kansas state line. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.
Yet the Verdigris River runs through it.

===Climate===
Nowata is the home of the coldest temperature ever recorded in the state of Oklahoma.

<text>Abraham Pierson (1646 – March 5, 1707) was an American Congregational minister who served as the first rector, from 1701 to 1707, and one of the founders of the Collegiate School — which later became Yale University.

==Biography==
He was born in Southampton, Long Island, where his father, the Rev. Abraham Pierson (Sr.), was the pastor of the Puritan (Congregational) church. At that time, Southampton and much of eastern Long Island were administered as part of the Connecticut Colony.

It is commonly stated that Abraham Pierson (Jr.) was born in Lynn, Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1640 or 1641. This claim conflicts with his gravestone in present-day Clinton, Connecticut, as well as the period he spent as a student at Harvard College (1664 to 1668).

Around 1647, Abraham&#x27;s family moved from Southampton to Branford in what is now Connecticut. At that time, Branford was affiliated with the (unchartered) New Haven Colony. The plans to move from Southampton to Branford began in 1644 when Southampton chose to become affiliated with Connecticut instead of New Haven. Abraham&#x27;s father was the pastor of the Puritan (Congregational) church in Branford from around 1647 to around 1667.

In 1667, Abraham&#x27;s family moved to New Jersey where his father established the community of New Ark, present-day Newark, New Jersey. At that time, Abraham (Jr.) was a student at Harvard College.

After graduating from Harvard College in 1668, Abraham was ordained a minister and he joined his father in New Ark. After his father&#x27;s death in 1678, Abraham succeeded his father as pastor of the First Congregational Church in Newark. Abraham also inherited a library of over 400 books from his father.

In 1691, the Congregational Church in Newark apparently chose to become Presbyterian. At that time, Abraham moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, to become the pastor of the First Congregational Church of Greenwich. In 1694, he moved to Killingworth (now Clinton, Connecticut).

Abraham Pierson was the minister of the Killingworth Congregational Church at the same time he started to teach the first classes of what would become Yale University. The new school was supposed to conduct its classes in Saybrook, but the Rev. Pierson could not be relieved of his duties as the pastor in Killingworth; thus, the classes were held in his parsonage.

Abraham Pierson is today interred in Clinton, Connecticut. Abraham Pierson School in Clinton, Connecticut (grades 4–5), was named for him; and a bronze statue of him is located on East Main Street in Clinton, Connecticut.

==Notes==
For the period of 1646 to about 1664, it has been assumed that Abraham Pierson, as a child, lived with his parents and followed the movements of his father, Rev. Abraham Pierson (Sr.). The Rev. Abraham Pierson Sr., was one of the most prominent figures in the New Haven Colony, and his activities are well-documented in many places, including the following.

<text>South Coffeyville is a town in Nowata County, Oklahoma, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town population was 785. The city of Coffeyville, Kansas is located approximately one mile north of the city, existing as a separate political entity.

==History==

For millennia, the land now known as Oklahoma was inhabited by Native Americans. In the 17th century, white trappers first visiting the area found it occupied mostly by the Osage and Quawpaw tribes. In 1803, modern Oklahoma was secured by the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1819, the Arkansas Territory was organized, then was split in 1824 and 1828. An 1828 treaty with the Cherokee Nation assigned the area of Nowata County to the Cherokees, who included it in 1856 in their newly created Cooweescoowee District. The Cherokees and the Delaware signed a treaty in 1867. In 1890, the area became part of the Oklahoma Territory. In 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th U.S. state and Nowata County was founded.

In 1888, the first settlement in the area was established as Stevens, a railhead tent and shack village, built just southwest of present South Coffeyville. It was named after a Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway builder, Stevens could be found on railroad maps until about 1902 but was eventually abandoned.

In 1906, a settlement called Polson was built approximately one mile northeast near the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway and Missouri Pacific Railways. Now part of the Union Pacific railway, the Missouri Pacific Railway had reached the present South Coffeyville townsite in 1889. The settlement was named after Martin and Earl Polson, early settlers, that designation was also short lived.

On March 18, 1909, a post office was established and the settlement was renamed to Etchen, in honor of a local citizen named John P. Etchen.

On April 29, 1909, the settlement was renamed a final time to the current South Coffeyville and the &quot;South Coffeyville Times&quot; newspaper began publication soon after. In August 1909, residents voted for incorporation. The name of South Coffeyville was derived from nearby city of Coffeyville, Kansas, which was named after James A. Coffey.

<text>Wann is a town in Nowata County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 125 at the 2010 census, a decrease of 5.3 percent from the figure of 132 recorded in 2000. Wann is known for the &quot;Six Flag Poles Over Wann America.

==History==
The town of Wann has connections to both Cherokee and Eastern Delaware origins. The town and a nearby creek were originally named Coon, after a Delaware family, when the first post office opened July 26, 1895. The town was renamed Wann on October 13, 1899, to honor a local Cherokee, Robert F. Wann. The town was a station on the stage route between Coffeyville, Kansas and Bartlesville, Indian Territory. When the Katy Railroad built its track northwest of town in 1902, the townspeople relocated to be nearer the Wann railroad station.

Wann had 201 inhabitants at Oklahoma&#x27;s first census in 1907. Oil was discovered in the Wann Oil Pool about this time, leading the population to grow to 286 in 1910 and 404 in 1920. The boom collapsed and so did the population.

The railroad track was abandoned in the 1980s, following the demise of the Katy Railroad. Wann&#x27;s economy now depends on local farming and ranching.

<text>Boley is a town in Okfuskee County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,091 at the 2020 Census. Boley was incorporated in 1905 as a predominantly Black pioneer town with persons having Native American ancestry among its citizens. Of the 50 identifiable Black towns established in Oklahoma between 1865 to 1920, Boley is one of only 13 still in existence. 

Boley is currently home to barbeque equipment maker, Smokaroma, Inc, and the John Lilley Correctional Center. The Boley Public School District closed the high school in 2007 and the elementary in 2010 due to declining enrollment. The Boley Historic District is a National Historic Landmark. 
Currently Boley hosts The Annual Boley Rodeo &amp; Bar-B-Que Festival.

==History==
=== Background ===
Creek Freedmen in the Indian Territory, who were the descendents of Black slaves held by the Creek tribe and alloted 160 acres of land each as a result of the Dawes Commission, set up independent townships, of which Boley was one. The town was established on land owned by Abigail Barnett, the daughter of a Creek Freedman.

As Boley and its surrounding area already possessed a well-established and independent Black community, many Black Southerners who eventually emigrated there perceived the town as a safe haven from the South&#x27;s limited economic opportunities, white supremacist paramilitaries (e.g. White League, Red Shirts, and the Ku Klux Klan), and discriminatory laws re-imposed at the collapse of Reconstruction.

===Town founding===
The principal founder of Boley was Thomas M. Haynes. Lake Moore, a white speculator, contributed the initial $500 investment needed to lease Barnett&#x27;s land for five years. Another influential figure was the town&#x27;s namesake, J. B. Boley, a white official of the Fort Smith &amp; Western Railroad who oversaw the development of a depot in the middle of Boley. After being approved for a post office two months prior in July, the town officially opened for settlement on September 26, 1903.

One of the most influential early settlers in Boley was David J. Turner, a businessman who would, besides serving as town mayor and councilman on multiple occasions, also work as a bank president and pharmacist. Another important settler was Hilliard Taylor, who developed a thriving cotton ginning business.

The development of the railroad brought traffic and allowed agricultural land to be more profitably used as a townsite. Property owned by the Barnett family, among other Creek Freedmen, was midway between Paden and Castle, and ideal for a station stop. With the approval of the railroad management, Boley, Creek Nation, Indian Territory was incorporated in 1905. During the early part of the 20th century, Boley became a regional business hub and one of the wealthiest Black towns in the US. It boasted two banks, including the first nationally-chartered Black-owned bank, three cotton gins, its own electric company, a movie theater, hotels, and multiple legal and dentistry practices. The town had over 4,000 residents by 1911, and was the home of two colleges: Creek-Seminole College, and Methodist Episcopal College. The Masonic Lodge was called &quot;the tallest building between Okmulgee and Oklahoma City,&quot; when it was built in 1912.

===O. H. Bradley and &quot;The Boley Progress&quot;===

One of the town&#x27;s largest weekly newspapers, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Boley Progress&quot;, was established in 1905. It promoted the town to African Americans in the American South, and specialized in reporting Southern news. In its debut issue, the &quot;Progress&quot; coined Boley the &quot;Haven of the Negro.&quot; An annual subscription initially cost $1.

Under the editorship of Oniel H. Bradley, the motto of the &quot;Progress&quot; was &quot;All Men Up, Not Some Down.&quot; Bradley promoted an &quot;emancipationist vision&quot; of Boley, portraying the town as a place where Black southerners could escape discrimination and finally enjoy a real freedom to serve as &quot;business men, farmers, merchants, and wage workers,&quot; free from the antagonism of hostile white mobs. Additionally, Bradley believed that flourishing and well-governed black towns like Boley would help alleviate the nation&#x27;s &quot;racial problem&quot; and counter negative stereotypes of Black Americans. Subscribers across the South were informed about Boley&#x27;s local economy, population growth, political elections, investment opportunities, and more. As a result of his promotional efforts, Bradley attracted Black settlers from diverse social backgrounds, ranging from farmers to college-educated professionals.

In the fall of 1905, Bradley&#x27;s &quot;Progress&quot; persuaded Joe P. Thompson, a devout reader from Rusk, Texas, to organize an emigration of approximately fifty Black families from his community to the area around Boley. Reflecting upon Boley&#x27;s ballooning growth in its initial years, early settler Hallie Smith Jones remarked that &quot;people came to Boley by train loads. In some instances eight and ten families would alight from the same train. Their luggage would fill the depot platform and would be piled six and seven feet high.&quot;

===Womanhood in Boley===

Black women served many valuable roles within the town, such as entrepreneurs, farmers, schoolteachers, tours guides for prospective settlers, and, of course, as loyal wives and mothers rearing future generations of Black children. 

Single-sex (women-exclusive) organizations committed to progressive principles sprouted up in Boley. For instance, the Ladies Industrial Club, founded in October 1908, was involved in various community service projects, playing a significant role in the creation of the town&#x27;s public library. California M. Taylor, who was renowned for her work as a notary public and later as a pharmacist, was an influential leader in Boley&#x27;s NAACP branch. 

===Black self-sufficiency===

Booker T. Washington visited Boley in 1905, and was so impressed that he included Boley in his speeches; black-towns like Boley embodied &quot;the path of advancement,&quot; as they provided opportunities for self-governance, moral upliftment, and the development of useful leadership and industrial skills. However, he also worried that separation from whites, if carried to the extreme, would be detrimental to black communities in the long-run. George Washington Carver once called Boley &quot;the most progressive black town in the U.S.&quot;

Boley became notorious for its sundown town signage, subverting whites-only norms, for reading, &quot;White man, don&#x27;t let the sun set on you here.&quot; The sign was removed by federal agents in 1924.

===Disenfranchisement and racial tensions===
Upon becoming the 46th U.S. state on November 16th, 1907, Jim Crow segregation laws were added to Oklahoma&#x27;s state constitution, largely due to the efforts of white Democrat William H. Murray Shortly after statehood came disenfranchisement, most significantly through the passing of a &quot;grandfather clause&quot; which stipulated that anyone whose ancestors lacked the right to vote prior to 1866 (i.e. slaves) would be subject to a literacy test. Historically, the solidly-Republican black population of Boley held the balance of political power in Okfuscee County, as nearby white towns were split between the two parties.

In mid-1911, within the tense atmosphere generated by the lynching of Laura and L.D. Nelson in the nearby town of Okemah, the county seat of Okfuskee County, a rumor circulated that the black residents in and around Boley were arming themselves to conduct a retaliatory attack. During the night of the predicted engagement, the white citizens of Okemah developed an elaborate defense system and prepared for battle. However, no fighting ever occurred, presumably because Boley&#x27;s black community had hunkered down themselves to protect their town.

In October 1911, a &quot;State Convention of Black Men and Women&quot; was hosted in Boley, organized by local black clergymen. The conservative, central message of the meeting was to advocate to neighboring white communities the specific distinction between Blacks who possess &quot;respectable standing in his community&quot; and those who embody the &quot;vicious element of the race.&quot; In an attempt to sooth racial tensions and prevent future mob violence, the convention sought to convince white audiences that the law-abiding Black middle-class would be willing to join arms with their white neighbors in condemning the lowly Black &quot;criminal.&quot;

===1932 bank raid of Pretty Boy Floyd&#x27;s gang ===

In November 1932, three members belonging to the gang of the notorious outlaw Pretty Boy Floyd attempted to rob Boley&#x27;s Farmers and Merchants Bank, but were thwarted by the town&#x27;s citizens. Floyd had previously warned his men not to attack Boley due to its residents being well-armed, but the interracial trio ignored the message. 

George Birdwell, the trio&#x27;s ringleader, and C.C. Patterson broke into the bank while Charles &quot;Pete&quot; Glass, a Black man who knew the town, waited in the getaway vehicle. While Birdwell and Patterson emptied the register of all cash, the bank&#x27;s president, David Turner, who was on duty at the time, sounded the alarm to alert the townspeople. Herbert C. McCormick, an assistant cashier who had been hiding in the bank vault with a rifle, then proceeded to shoot Birdwell. Birdwell managed to fire multiple shots into Turner before collapsing onto the bank&#x27;s floor. However, the chronology of what transpired inside the bank are not completely clear, as some accounts contend that an infuriated Birdwell shot Turner after discovering that he had pulled the alarm, which then caused McCormick to open fire on Birdwell.

Patterson shuffled out of the bank and attempted to flee to the getaway vehicle, but he had now come face-to-face with Boley&#x27;s armed citizenry, who had grabbed whatever weapons they could find, including guns, screwdrivers, and tools. Though Patterson was &quot;riddled with bullets,&quot; he miraculously survived and was arrested by Boley sheriff Joseph Langston McCormick, the brother of the bank worker who had shot Birdwell. Glass, hearing the gunfire, had exited the car and made his way towards the bank to help his fellow bandits, but upon seeing Patterson collapse from his wounds, desperately scrambled back towards the vehicle. While attempting to drive away, Glass was shot dead. The townspeople had successfully foiled the attempted heist.

Tragically, David Turner, who had dedicated decades of his life towards Boley&#x27;s development, perished in the arms of his wife as he was in transit to the hospital in Okemah. Now the Governor of Oklahoma, William H. Murray, the very same man who sought to destroy the independence of Black-towns like Boley decades prior, sent his official condolences; thousands of people from around the state went to Boley to attend Turner&#x27;s funeral. The Farmers and Merchants Bank was closed shortly thereafter.

As historian William Savage Jr. notes, several conflicting narratives of the robbery attempt had unfortunately sprung up in the ensuing decades, demonstrating the shortcomings of relying upon human recollection. The most egregious differences in accounts relate to how Birdwell died (including how many times he was shot and by whom) and the details about what specific gun Herbert McCormick used.
===Decline===
Boley&#x27;s development paralleled that of the Fort Smith &amp; Western Railway, which went bankrupt during the Great Depression and ceased operations in 1939. Additionally, Boley&#x27;s economy was heavily dependent on cotton farming, which often created long-lasting debt for its producers and, from the 1920s, suffered from recurrent boll weevil infestations. The Dust Bowl of the 1930s also encouraged families to move out of Boley. As economic opportunities dried up, some of Boley&#x27;s black population migrated to Canada and Western Africa, but most ended up moving to larger cities in search of better job prospects. Before World War II, Boley&#x27;s population had declined to about 700. With the Second Great Migration underway, by 1960 most of the population had left for other urban areas. So far the New Great Migration has not benefited Boley. However, Boley remains one of the state&#x27;s few remaining historic African-American towns and its population today (approximately 1,091) is an improvement compared to its population of 423 just four decades prior.

==In popular culture==
The Oklahoma Historical Society created the touring exhibition &quot;Thirteen All-Black Towns of Oklahoma,&quot; highlighting Boley and 12 additional towns that have survived into the 21st century. Preview materials note: &quot;When E. P. McCabe came to Oklahoma in the 1889 Land Run his vision was to create an All-Black state. Although that never materialized, McCabe and others succeeded in establishing All-Black towns. Nowhere else, neither in the Deep South nor the Far West, did so many African American men and women come together to create, occupy, and govern their own communities. Boley, Brooksville, Clearview, Grayson, Langston, Lima, Red Bird, Rentiesville, Taft, Tatums, Tullahassee, Summit, and Vernon are the towns highlighted in this exhibit.&quot;

==Quotations about Boley from Booker T. Washington==
In a 2017 interview, historian Currie Ballard told The Oklahoman: “Boley was once the crown jewel of all the black towns in Oklahoma...Booker T. Washington came to Boley … twice and deemed it the finest black town in the world — and Booker T. Washington had literally been all around the world. Boley, its significance in commerce, its significance in education, parallels no other black town in the nation.”
Quotes about Boley attributed to Washington include:

&quot;They have recovered something of the knack for trade that their fore-parents in Africa were famous for&quot;.

&quot;Boley, Indian Territory, is the youngest, most enterprising, and in many ways the most interesting of the Negro towns in the US.&quot;

== History ==
Clearview, Oklahoma, was founded in 1903 prior to statehood by J.A. Roper, Lemuel Jackson, and John Grayson, who established the Lincoln Townsite Company to attract Black settlers. Located along the Fort Smith and Western Railroad, Clearview was part of the Black Town Movement, which provided African Americans opportunities for landownership, self-governance, and economic independence. This migration to Oklahoma was driven by the desire to escape the oppressive Jim Crow laws of the American South. Agriculture quickly became its economic backbone.

1903, the Abe Lincoln Trading Company opened, serving as the town&#x27;s primary trading post and commercial center. It provided local farmers with farming supplies, household goods, and building materials; Clearview&#x27;s agricultural economy was primarily based on cotton farming, which became its residents&#x27; primary income source. Along with cotton, other essential crops such as corn, beans, and vegetables were cultivated, creating local food security and supporting a robust agricultural economy. As the town developed, Clearview established other institutions. The Clearview Brick Factory was established in the 1900s, providing bricks for constructing homes, businesses, and community buildings.

<text>Okemah ( or ) is the largest city in and the county seat of Okfuskee County, Oklahoma, United States. It is the birthplace of folk music legend Woody Guthrie. Thlopthlocco Tribal Town, a federally recognized Muscogee Indian tribe, is headquartered in Okemah. The population was 3,078 at the 2020 census, a 6.1 percent decline from 3,223 at the 2010 census.
==History==
Historically occupied by the Osage and Quapaw, who ceded their lands to the United States by 1825, the area was assigned to the Creek Nation and specifically the Thlopthlocco Tribal Town after Indian Removal of tribes from the Southeast United States in the 1830s.

Okemah was named after a Kickapoo Indian chief. In March 1902, Chief &quot;Okemah&quot; built a bark house in his tribe&#x27;s traditional fashion. He had come to await the opening of the townsite, which took his name on April 22, 1902. In the Kickapoo language, &quot;okemah&quot; means &quot;things up high,&quot; such as a highly placed person or town, or high ground.

In preparation for Oklahoma&#x27;s statehood, the Dawes Commission was authorized in 1896 to work with the Five Civilized Tribes to enroll their members for allotments of tribal land to individual households. Registration of tribal members lasted from 1898 to 1906. After allotment, the government was going to declare the remaining tribal lands &quot;surplus&quot; and sell them to European-American settlers.

Okemah was platted by a group of Shawnee residents in March 1902 on land belonging to Mahala and Nocus Fixico, full-blood Creek. The Fixicos had no legal right at the time to sell their holding, as enrollment of tribal members on the Dawes Roll continued until 1906, and no land-sales were to take place by Indians until it was completed. That did not appear to affect the promoters or the development of the town.

On April 22, 1902, the formal opening launched the town. A post office opened on May 16, and the town was incorporated in 1903. In the spring of 1904, Commission restrictions on the sale of townsite lots were removed. The Department of the Interior trustees of land held by American Indians paid the Fixicos $50 an acre for their land, and gave legal deeds to the purchasers who claimed title.

In the town&#x27;s first week, the following stores were established: four general merchandise, two hardware, one 5 &amp; 10 cent store, three drugstores, four groceries, three wagon-yards, four lumberyards, three cafes, one bakery, two millineries, four livery-barns, three blacksmiths, two dairies, two cotton-gins, and two weekly newspapers. Eight doctors settled there, four lawyers, two walnut log buyers, and one Chinese laundryman. Two hotels were quickly put up, including the three-story Broadway hotel, which set the city apart as an important town in early Oklahoma.

Okfuskee County had been organized at the time of statehood in 1907. Okemah was chosen as county seat in a county election held August 27, 1908.

===Firsts===

The townsite was selected by two railroad surveyors, Perry Rodkey and H.R. Dexter. Dexter is credited with choosing the town name. They picked the site believing that two railroads, the Fort Smith and Western Railroad and the Ozark and Cherokee Central Railway (later the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway) would intersect there. While the former did build a line through the site, the latter never did.

The town&#x27;s first state-chartered bank began business the day of the opening, April 22, 1902, in a tent on the northwest corner of the present Fifth and Broadway (now City Hall). C. J. Benson was president. W. H. Dill was vice president and served as cashier. It became the First National Bank in 1903, but was liquidated in 1939, having failed due to the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression.

J. E. Galloway was the first mayor; Perry Rodkey, first postman; E. D. Dexter, first hotel operator; Dill ran the first telephone company; John D. Richards had the first hardware store; McGee Brothers put in the first cotton gin; and E. E. Shook established the first lumberyard. The first church in the city was the North Methodist, at Sixth and Ash, but the first church service Baptist, presided over by the Rev. Black. The editor Charles Barnclaw published the first newspaper.

===Lynching===

Although a police force was organized in the town soon after its founding (a Mr. Franklin wore the first city policeman&#x27;s badge), vigilantes were active during Okemah&#x27;s early years. Law enforcement and justices of the peace were located some distance away. The vigilantes appeared to have had almost complete freedom of action.

In 1911, a black woman, 35-year-old Laura Nelson, and her teenage son, L. D., were lynched by a mob of white men. Accused of killing a police officer in an altercation at their home near Paden, they were kidnapped from the Okfuskee county jail and hanged from a suspension bridge over the North Canadian River.

According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, the present town of Weleetka was founded by three men from other communities who were having difficulty surviving in the newspaper business. These men, George F. Clarke of Vinita, Lake Moore of Fairland and John Jacobs of Holdenville, decided in 1899 to form a partnership and find a new town where they might find prosperity together. They had already learned that the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway (SL&amp;SF or &quot;Frisco&quot;) was building a line southward from Sapulpa, Indian Territory, to Denison, Texas. Clarke and Moore knew that the Fort Smith and Western Railway was laying a line westward from Indian Territory to Guthrie, in Oklahoma Territory. The partners decided to establish a town at the junction of the two railroads. The partners selected a suitable town site on a hill just north of the Canadian River that was owned by Martha Lowe, a Creek Indian who had received an allotment. Someone suggested that the partners name the new site, &quot;Weleetka&quot;, a Creek word that meant &quot;running water&quot; in English.

The partners began selling townsite lots for 40 dollars each on February 10, 1902. Within a day, they had netted enough to pay Mrs. Lowe for her land as well as cover their other expenses. On the following day, the First Bank of Weleetka opened for business. By the time it closed that evening, it held $3,000 in deposits. Business continued to be brisk, and a Weleetka post office was established on March 14, 1902.

The surrounding area was mostly devoted to agriculture, where farmers produced cotton, wheat, oats, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, peanuts, and pecans. Later, it became known for production of oil and gas. The town had a population of 1,020 at statehood in 1907. By 1930, it could boast of having 2,042 people. It also had two hotels, three cotton gins, a cotton compress, three drug stores, an opera house, and a mercantile company.

Weleetka was once a major railroad town, serving as the division point for the Fort Smith and Western Railway. All train crews changed out in Weleetka; the town also housed major shops and repair facilities for the steam locomotives. Headquartered in Fort Smith, Arkansas, the Fort Smith and Western was a railroad that operated in the states of Arkansas and Oklahoma. The railroad&#x27;s main line extended 217 miles, from Ft. Smith through Weleetka to Guthrie. The Fort Smith and Western owned a subsidiary, St. Louis, El Reno and Western, which began operating 42 miles between Guthrie and El Reno, Oklahoma in June 1904. The railroad also acquired 32.5 miles of trackage rights over the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad from Fallis, Oklahoma to Oklahoma City.

The railroad supported much of the business and hotels of the city in the first half of the 1900s. Trains entering town from the East were switched and broken down in Weleetka, and dispatched northwest for either Oklahoma City, Guthrie or El Reno. Due to the railroad yard in Weleetka, the single westbound train could thus become two westbound trains. The reverse was true for eastbound trains. Weleetka was vital to the life of the railroad. The railroad provided regular passenger service and at one time boasted through Pullman sleeping cars to and from St. Louis and Oklahoma City. The route of the FS&amp;W served no major population centers, but did serve major coal mining operations in eastern Oklahoma at Coal Creek, Bokoshe, and McCurtain. Other towns served included Crowder, Okemah, Boley, Prague, Vernon, Indianola and Meridian. A major portion of the road&#x27;s freight traffic was metallurgical-grade coal from San Bois Coal Company mines near McCurtain. As coal traffic declined, an oil discovery near Okemah brought additional traffic, which postponed the abandonment of the railroad. The Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad withdrew trackage rights between Fallis and Oklahoma City in January 1939 after FS&amp;W defaulted on rental fees, and when the Fort Smith and Western ceased operations on February 9, 1939, Weleetka lost its major employer.

Beginning in 1930, both cotton production and railroad service declined, followed by a steady loss of population throughout the 20th Century. Weleetka remained a trading center for its area, and in 2000, there were still 1,014 residents. Ten churches, a school system, and a weekly newspaper, the &quot;Weleetkan&quot;, served the community. The Weleetka Town Hall and Jail were included in the National Register of Historic Places listings in Okfuskee County, Oklahoma (NR 93000156). The 2010 population had declined further to 998.

<text>Arcadia is a town in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, United States, and a part of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. The population was 169 at the 2020 United States census, a 31% decrease from 247 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Arcadia was established soon after the Land Rush of 1889 and drew both white and African American cotton farmers, who named the land after the Greek town of Arcadia. A post office was established in 1890. The Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad constructed a line in 1902-3 from Bartlesville to Oklahoma City, passing immediately south of Arcadia.

The town thrived as an agricultural community in the early 20th century. Located near the Deep Fork River, the soil was well suited to producing cotton. The local newspaper, the &quot;Arcadia Star&quot;, claimed Arcadia had a population of 800 in 1904. However, the U.S. census of 1900 counted only 706 in Deep Fork Township, which included Arcadia. The census at statehood in 1907 registered 994 persons in Arcadia.

In June 1924, fire destroyed most of the business district. One building, Tulon&#x27;s Drugstore, survived and is now listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Voters resisted incorporation attempts in the 1930s and again in 1980. Sentiment changed after Edmond, Oklahoma attempted to annex the community in 1984-85, and Arcadia finally incorporated in 1987.

<text>Bethany is a city in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, United States, and a part of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. Bethany has a population of 20,831 at the 2020 census, a 9.3% increase from 2010. The community was founded in 1909 by followers of the Church of the Nazarene from Oklahoma City.

==History==
Bethany was founded July 28, 1909 as a community where members of the Church of the Nazarene, an evangelical Christian movement that developed from Holiness churches, could practice their religious beliefs without interference by non-members. The town was named after the biblical place of Bethany. The community quickly founded Oklahoma Holiness College (now known as Southern Nazarene University, SNU). Two other institutions were soon established, the Oklahoma Orphanage (now the Children&#x27;s Center, a medical facility) operated by Mattie Mallory, and the Nazarene Rescue Home for unwed mothers.

Bethany incorporated on August 8, 1910 as a rural town; its economy depended on the surrounding farmlands. It gained a post office on March 11, 1913. With a relatively large population of conservative Nazarenes, the town council soon enacted strict blue laws that banned alcohol, tobacco, gambling, dancing, movies, swearing, and working on Sundays. After Bethany reorganized as a first class city in 1931, it relaxed these laws to some extent.

An F4 tornado struck Bethany on November 19, 1930, killing 23 people and destroying 652 buildings. It is one of three documented violent November tornadoes in Oklahoma since 1900. Recovery from the storm was slow until the outbreak of World War II.

<doc id="130447" wikidata="Q2888698" url="?curid=130447" title="Del City, Oklahoma">
<text>Del City is a city in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, United States, and a part of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. The population was 21,822 at the United States Census, 2020, a 2.3% increase from 2010.

Del City is located near two major interstate highways, both of which connect it to Oklahoma City. Interstate 40 bisects the town from the northwest to southeast, and Interstate 35 lies just a short distance west of the city. The city borders southeast Oklahoma City, Midwest City and Tinker Air Force Base. George Epperly, founded the city, which was incorporated by a vote of its residents in 1948. Del City is named after Epperly&#x27;s eldest daughter, Delaphene Campbell. Since its incorporation Del City has expanded three times, first by annexing Carter Park in 1954, Midway Village in 1963 and the acquisition of an undeveloped piece of land between the city and Tinker AFB
A large area of Del City was significantly impacted by the May 3, 1999, tornado outbreak that passed through the Oklahoma City metro area.

==History==
Founded in Boone Township, Oklahoma County, as a &quot;bedroom&quot; community, Del City lies three miles (5 km) east of Oklahoma City and one mile (1.6 km) west of Midwest City. At the turn of the 21st century, Del City was a community surrounded on the north, west, and south by Oklahoma City and on the east by Midwest City. Interstate Highway 40 bisects the town from the northwest to southeast. Oklahoma City streets define the boundaries: NE 10th Street on the north; Sooner Road on the east; SE 44th Street on the south; and Bryant Avenue on the west. Northwestern corner of the city is a mile from the junction of Interstate 35 and Interstate 40, justifying its claim to being &quot;the Crossroads of America.&quot;

In the Land Run of 1889, Jordan Pybas and his wife settled in what is present-day Del City. Five generations later the family still lives in the house that was completed in 1907. Before 1946 there were only two families living in what would become Del City. Developer George Epperly purchased a wheat field large at the corner of SE 29th Street and Sunnylane Road in 1946 with a plan to build fifty houses. In 1948 there were 582 homes in Del City, 75% of which were built by George Epperly, Despite opposition, the unincorporated Epperly Heights and its 200 families voted to approve incorporation on October 9, 1948. In February 1959, Del City adopted a charter and a council-manager form of town government. The city was named for Epperly&#x27;s daughter, Delaphene Campbell.

The city expanded through the annexation of Carter Park in 1954 and Midway Village in 1963. Del City attempted to annex the &quot;Rose Smith Addition&quot; but its residents incorporated and became the town of Smith Village. The city also acquired a piece of undeveloped land that separated it from Tinker Air Force Base. Oklahoma City annexed this same piece of land, and a court fight ensued. In District court, Del City won and Oklahoma City appealed to the State Supreme Court. Del City officials, while awaiting the hearing, pursued negotiation again with Oklahoma City this time accepting along the Tinker AFB boundary. Del City, having expanded to its greatest possible physical limits in 1964, joined Midwest City and Norman in underwriting the Little River Reservoir Project that became Lake Thunderbird.

The Del City Historical Society was organized in 1975 with Andy Evans as its first president. Several children of the Eighty-niners (89ers) still lived in the area, and they identified every original homestead within city limits. Residents also learned that their town was on the path of the 1870s Arbuckle Trail, a Texas to Kansas cattle trail. Wrestler and two-time Olympic Gold Medal winner John Smith previously resided in Del City.

With home building and family-oriented amenities the founding focus, industry was slow to develop in Del City to create any jobs (99 percent of Del Citians commuted to work in 1948, while only 96 percent commuted in 2000). Don&#x27;s Alley Restaurant and Midwest Trophy Manufacturing are two businesses of long standing. Don Moore opened his hamburger grill at 4601 SE 29th Street in 1955, but on October 31, 2022 it was announced that Don&#x27;s Alley Restaurant would permanently close. Midwest Trophy Manufacturing began in David R. Smith&#x27;s garage in Del City in 1971. Midwest Trophy Manufacturing (now known as MTM Recognition) employs over 750 people throughout North America, 400 of them in Del City. It is the city&#x27;s largest industry. MTM Recognition&#x27;s corporate headquarters are in Del City at 3405 SE 29th Street.

Del City is represented in the Oklahoma Legislature by House District 94 Representative Andy Fugate and Senate District 46 Senator Mark Mann. On the national level Del City is represented by 4th district Representative Tom Cole, and by U.S. Senators James Lankford and Markwayne Mullin.
Del City as had four newspapers &quot;Del City Leader&quot;, &quot;Del City Sun&quot;, &quot;Del City Times&quot;, and the &quot;Del City News&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The city is located in the Frontier Country region in the center of the state. Del City lies in the Sandstone Hills region of Oklahoma, known for hills of and two species of oak – blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica) and post oak (Q. stellata).

Del City is in a region dominated by the Cross Timbers, an area of prairie and patches of forest at the eastern extent of the Great Plains. The region is essentially a transition buffer between the wetter and more forested Eastern Oklahoma and the semi-arid high plains of Western Oklahoma, and experiences extreme swings between dry and wet weather patterns. Climate is dominated by large differences in annual rainfall totals, with Central Oklahoma&#x27;s western boundary receiving far less rain than compared to its eastern boundary. Because of these convergences of dry and wet weather patterns, Del City is located at the heart of what is known as Tornado Alley, and is in one of the most tornado-prone areas in the United States.
Eagle Lake is located within Del City; the lake is located in the northern part of the city and is the only large body of water. The lake is stocked with bass, catfish, bluegill, carp, vancuren trout and crappie.

==1999 tornado==

A large area of Del City was significantly damaged by the Bridge Creek–Moore F5 tornado that passed through the Oklahoma City metropolitan area on May 3, 1999. The tornado first touched down southwest of the community of Amber. The funnel was approximately a half-mile wide when it entered Del City as an F4 from the west near the intersection of S.E. 44th Street and Spiva Drive. The tornado continued on a north-northeast trajectory, exiting the city near Sooner Road and Woodview Drive. Hail and high winds were experienced by residents in the surrounding area. President Bill Clinton visited Del City and the surrounding areas a few days later to view the damage caused by the storm.
The tornado was the last to be classified as an F5 tornado in the United States under the original Fujita scale system before the Enhanced Fujita Scale was implemented in February 2007. Even so, within a few years most of the area had been rebuilt. The only visible evidence of the tornado&#x27;s path today include the cluster of newly constructed homes, the absence of large trees, and an interruption in the row of evergreen trees that lined Sooner Road between 44th Street and 29th Street.

A memorial stands along a walking and bike path on Sooner Road and is dedicated to the seven people who lost their lives during the May 3 tornado. United States Air Force Staff Sergeant James Day was killed in an ATV accident on May 8, 1999, while he was patrolling an area of Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, which had been damaged in the tornado. He is also listed on the memorial.

The tornado was the deadliest and most destructive of the numerous tornadoes that were part of the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak. A 2006 National Geographic Channel documentary, &quot;Ultimate Tornado&quot;, discusses unusually violent tornado events and includes footage of the outbreak. The tornado ultimately claimed a total of 36 lives throughout the Oklahoma City metropolitan area.

<text>Edmond is a city in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, United States. It is a part of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area, located in Central Oklahoma. The population was 94,428 according to the 2020 United States Census, a 16% increase from 2010. making it the 5th most populous city in Oklahoma.

==History==
===19th century===
The Santa Fe rail line in Oklahoma Territory established a water and coaling station for steam engines at this location when the Santa Fe Railroad built into Indian Territory in 1887. The site for the station was chosen because it was the highest point on the line in Oklahoma County; trains could more easily accelerate going downhill while leaving the station in either direction. The railroad then named the station for Edmond Burdick, the Santa Fe&#x27;s traveling freight agent. When the town was formed after the Oklahoma Land Run of 1889, early settlers decided to adopt the name. Though most of the remnants of the old railroad infrastructure are gone, the Santa Fe, now BNSF, freight line still runs through the same course. 

The town of Edmond sprang up overnight during the great Oklahoma land run on April 22, 1889, when homesteads were staked around the Santa Fe station. The original plat for Edmond was prepared by the Seminole Town and Development Company, a newly formed syndicate with ties to the railroad. Many of the original streets were named for men associated with either the Santa Fe Railroad or the town syndicate. The first mayor and city officers were elected in May 1889, and Edmond&#x27;s population was 294 in the 1890 census.

The first public schoolhouse in Oklahoma Territory, completed in August 1889, is in Edmond. It still stands as a historic monument on 2nd Street between Boulevard and Broadway and is open to the public on the first two Saturdays of each month or by appointment.

St. John the Baptist Catholic Church, the first church opened after the land run, was located on the southwest corner of East First and South Boulevard. The congregation still exists, although not in its original building or location.

In December 1890, the territorial legislature established three universities: the state university in Norman, the agricultural and mechanical college in Stillwater, and a &quot;normal&quot; or teaching school in Edmond.
The first classes for the Territorial Normal School (University of Central Oklahoma) were held November 9, 1891, in the Methodist Church on the southwest corner of North Broadway and West Hurd. Old North, the Territorial Normal School&#x27;s iconic first building, was opened for classes on January 2, 1893, and ahead of Oklahoma State University&#x27;s Central Hall or Oklahoma University&#x27;s Science Hall.

The &quot;Edmond Sun&quot;, established by Milton W. &quot;Kicking Bird&quot; Reynolds on July 18, 1889, was the state&#x27;s oldest continuous newspaper dating from Oklahoma Territorial days.

===20th century===

In the early 20th century, Edmond was known as a sundown town. Racial covenants barred property sales to individuals of races other than white people or Native Americans in every neighborhood built between 1911 and 1949 except the Edmond Highway Addition in 1924. Racial housing covenants in the United States became unenforceable in 1948 after the &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot; decision by the United States Supreme Court.

In 1925, a new city charter was written for the city including a still enforced requirement that all candidates for mayor or city council be freeholders, or landowners within the city.

Edmond was the site of a workplace shooting on August 20, 1986, in which 14 people were killed and six wounded by Patrick Sherrill, a postman who then committed suicide. This event was the deadliest killing in a string of U.S. postal employee murder–suicides which inspired the slang term &quot;going postal&quot;. A memorial to the victims of the attack stands outside the U.S. Post Office in downtown Edmond.

The city was the subject of a Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals case challenging the depiction of a Christian cross on the city seal, raising issues concerning the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution. In May 1996, the Supreme Court let stand a Federal Appeals Court ruling ordering the city to remove the cross from the seal. Rather than replace the cross, the city council voted to leave the spot blank so as to &quot;remind people of what was there,&quot; as well as this being the least expensive way to comply.

===21st century===
A memorial service for famed Oklahoman baseball player Bobby Murcer was held in Edmond on August 6, 2008, at the Memorial Road Church of Christ. Among the some 2,000 attending the memorial were Reggie Jackson, Derek Jeter, Andy Pettitte, and former Yankees manager Joe Girardi.

In 2011, Darrell Davis was elected as the first Black City Councilor in Edmond&#x27;s history and in 2021 he was elected the first Black Mayor of Edmond.

On July 4, 2007, the city inaugurated a bronze statue of Nannita R.H. Daisey, believed to be the first woman laying claim on Oklahoma land in the first (1889) land run. In 2015 the Dave McGary sculpture of Chief Touch the Clouds was relocated to Edmond from Houston&#x27;s Astrodome. The 18-foot-tall, 15-foot-wide sculpture is located on Second Street at the entrance of the University of Central Oklahoma.

Edmond residents have access to 57 Protestant and three Catholic congregations, six Latter-day Saint congregations, one Unitarian Universalist church, one Islamic mosque, and one Haziratu&#x27;l-Quds for followers of the Baháʼí Faith.

A 163 foot tall cross sits at the Edmond Campus of Life.Church on the corner of State Highway 66 (also called Second Street) and the I-35 Service Road. The church, known at the time as MetroChurch, fought the city of Edmond to erect the cross, which the planning commission didn&#x27;t want to allow because they considered it a billboard.
