<doc id="135721" wikidata="Q981458" url="?curid=135721" title="De Leon, Texas">
<text>De Leon ( ) is a city located in Comanche County in the U.S. state of Texas. Its population was 2,258 in the 2020 census. It is commonly associated with being named after the Spanish explorer Ponce de León, but the town is actually named for its location on the Leon River (&quot;de León&quot; in Spanish), which flows directly north and east of the community, and drains into nearby Proctor Lake.

==History==
The town was laid out in April 1881 by surveying crews of the Texas Central Railway as part of the historic Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad (KATY) as it constructed a line from Ross just north of the Waco area, to Stamford, with the ultimate goal of extending the line to Colorado. The first city lots were auctioned on July 7, 1881, by Robert Morris Elgin, the Texas Central&#x27;s land agent and for whom the town of Elgin had been named.

Initially incorporated by an election held on August 30, 1890, the town government appears to have dwindled over the years, and the community was reincorporated in an election held August 29, 1899. The first mayor elected under the new incorporation was former Comanche County Judge John Lambert, who took office in April 1900.

===Expulsion of the Black population===
After a murder that led to the lynching of a Black suspect, the white residents of Comanche County visited all black residents and told them to leave the county within 10 days. In fact, the lack of Black population was later a source of civic pride. At the railroad station, a sign read &quot;Nigger, don&#x27;t let the sun go down on you in this town.&quot; Black porters would hide in the baggage cars in Comanche County.

===Arrival of the train line===

The population of De Leon remained under 1,000 until 1910, when a branch of the Texas Central line, then leased by the Katy Railroad, was constructed from De Leon to Rising Star and Cross Plains. It was the only town in Comanche County with railroad service and a station. De Leon then became the center point for the Katy between Waco, Albany, and Cross Plains, thereby relocating numerous railroad crew members and their families to the city. The census of 1910 showed 1,015 citizens. De Leon continues to retain its rail service and the former Texas Central Katy line from Dublin to Gorman, nicknamed the &quot;Peanut Line&quot;, is currently operated by the Fort Worth and Western Railroad.

On Labor Day night 1918, oil was discovered north of De Leon just inside the Comanche County line near Desdemona. During the next two years, nearly 1000 wells were drilled in the area, and the population of De Leon rose to an estimate of more than 5,000 people. The boom was short-lived, though, and by the time the actual was census taken in 1920, the population was only 3,302. Since World War II, De Leon&#x27;s population has stabilized at approximately 2,500.

Ranching dominated Comanche County until the coming of the Texas Central in 1881. Cotton soon became the primary crop, as immigrants from the Southern states, and in particular the area around Oxford and Pontotoc, Mississippi, came to the De Leon vicinity, starting in 1890. When the boll weevil began to make inroads in the area after 1910, farmers just west of town began to plant the small Spanish peanut. That quickly became the predominant crop, and in 1913, the De Leon Peanut Company was organized. Over time, Comanche County became the leading peanut-producing county in the U.S. Coupled with production around the neighboring community of Gorman in Eastland County, most of the peanuts went into candy, particularly Curtis Candies&#x27; Baby Ruth and Butterfinger candy bars. Nabisco eventually purchased the De Leon Peanut Company. In the 21st century, peanut production has dropped dramatically.

De Leon has one of the oldest festivals in Texas, the De Leon Peach and Melon Festival, which had its beginnings in 1914. Celebrated during the first full week in August, it draws thousands to its numerous events, including a carnival, tractor pulls, car show, and a free cold watermelon slicing. The current watermelon seed-spitting distance record, as recognized by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, of 75 feet 2 inches, was set at the festival on August 12, 1995, by Jason Schayot, then of Georgetown, Texas. Schayot is a descendant of two long-time De Leon families.

Among De Leon&#x27;s unique events is the only paid appearance by Elvis Presley in which he sang only gospel music. It took place at Hodges Park on July 4, 1955, when he followed his friends, the Blackwood Brothers, at the Battle of Songs show. The Blackwoods had lost family members in a plane crash in Alabama the previous year, just prior to a scheduled appearance in De Leon, and had remembered them in a performance immediately preceding Elvis&#x27; performance. Elvis followed with more gospel music. It was one of three appearances Elvis made that day for promoter W.B. Nowlin, then mayor of De Leon. The other two were in Brownwood and Stephenville.

Included among De Leon&#x27;s most distinguished citizens are former Texas Speaker of the House and later Lieutenant Governor Ben Barnes, a protégé of John B. Connally and Lyndon B. Johnson, and the 1955 Pulitzer Prize winner William White, whose &quot;The Taft Story&quot; focuses upon Republican presidential contender Robert A. Taft. Winston Lee Moore, composer and singer of &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes&quot;, was reared just north of De Leon. He is better known under his stage name, Slim Willet. Former State Representative Sid Miller was born in De Leon in 1955; he was a candidate for Texas Agriculture Commissioner in the Republican primary election scheduled for March 4, 2014.

Buried in the De Leon Cemetery is Cyrus Campbell, an early resident, who was the blacksmith who made the leg irons placed on Mexican General Antonio López de Santa Anna following his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto. According to Campbell&#x27;s family tradition, his three brothers and he were the men who actually captured Lopez de Santa Anna the day following the battle.

The town motto, &quot;Busiest Town, Friendliest People&quot;, is a reminder of the slower-paced lifestyle still available in a few communities in this country.

<text>Gainesville is a city in and the county seat of Cooke County, Texas, United States. Its population was 17,394 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Texoma region and is an important Agri-business center.

==History==

Founded in 1850, the city of Gainesville was established on a tract of land donated by Mary E. Clark. City residents called their new community &quot;Liberty&quot;, which proved short-lived, as Liberty, Texas, already existed. One of the original settlers of Cooke County, Colonel William Fitzhugh, suggested that the town be named after General Edmund Pendleton Gaines. Gaines, a United States general under whom Fitzhugh had served, had been sympathetic to the Texas Revolution.

The first hint of prosperity arrived with the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach in September 1858, bringing freight, passengers, and mail. In 1860, Cooke County voted against secession. In 1862, during the Civil War, the Great Hanging at Gainesville, a controversial trial and lynching of 40 suspected Union loyalists, brought the new town to the attention of the state and came close to ripping the county apart. In the decade after the Civil War, Gainesville had its first period of extended growth, catalyzed by the expansion of the cattle industry in Texas. Gainesville, only from the Oklahoma border, became a supply point for cowboys driving herds north to Kansas. The merchants of Gainesville reaped considerable benefits from the passing cattle drives.

Within 20 years, its population increased from a few hundred to more than 2,000. Gainesville was incorporated on February 17, 1873, and by 1890 was established as a commercial and shipping point for area ranchers and farmers. In the late 1870s, two factors drastically altered the historic landscape of North-central Texas. The first of these was barbed wire. In 1875, Henry B. Sanborn, a regional sales agent for Joseph Glidden&#x27;s Bar Fence Company of DeKalb, Illinois, traveled to Texas. That autumn, he chose Gainesville as one of his initial distribution points for the newly invented barbed wire, which his employer had patented the previous year. On his first visit to Gainesville, he sold 10 reels of the wire to the Cleaves and Fletcher hardware store—the first spools of barbed wire ever sold in Texas.

World War II had an enormous impact on Cooke County. Camp Howze, an army infantry training camp, was established on some of the best farmland in the county. The construction of the camp helped bring Cooke County out of the Great Depression by providing jobs. The county population doubled and the area boomed.

Since then, tourism has brought renewed prosperity to the area. The return of Amtrak on June 14, 1999, brought Gainesville back full circle to one of the original sources of its growth and success. In the early 1990s, Gainesville had 600 businesses and a population of 14,587. By 2020, the population had grown to 17,394.

===Courthouse===
Gainesville is home to a courthouse with an octagonal rotunda topped by stained glass, erected in 1910. &quot;The 1912 Cooke County Courthouse was designed by the Dallas firm of Lang &amp; Witchell. The courthouse was designed in the Beaux Arts style with some Prairie Style features and influences from famed Chicago architect Louis Sullivan. The courthouse in the center of Gainesville features black and white marbled interiors and a tall central atrium capped by a stained glass skylight under the tower.&quot; The courthouse is undergoing a major renovation project, resulting in the move of many county offices to surrounding buildings.

In 1911 a monolith topped with a statue of a Confederate soldier was placed on the lawn outside the courthouse. The inscription of the plaque beside it reads &quot;“no nation rose so white and fair none fell so pure of crime” referring to the Southern cause. In 2020, in the wake of the killing of George Floyd and the removal of Confederate statues elsewhere, County Commissioners voted to retain the courthouse&#x27;s Confederate monument.

===Camp Howze, World War II===
Gainesville was once home to Camp Howze, one of the largest infantry replacement training centers during World War II. Only a few remnants of the camp still exist, but they are now located on private property.

===Railroad===

Railroads across Texas changed the nature and reach of commerce when they were built through and into areas. When the first railroad arrived in Gainesville, it improved the city&#x27;s economics. For the first time, reliable, timely transportation meant goods and people could go vast distances. Gainesville was connected to the outside world in a whole new way with the coming of the railroads. For example, when the GC&amp;SF arrived in 1887, goods could travel directly to or from Gainesville, directly to Chicago and Galveston, on the same railroad. Both were major transportation hubs during that age, and still are today.

Original companies and dates of arrival in Gainesville:
* The Denison and Pacific Railway (1879) (now a part of UP via the MKT) – route: Denison, TX to Gainesville via Whitesboro, TX
* Gainesville, Henrietta and Western Railway (1886) (now a part of UP via the MKT) – route: Gainesville to Wichita Falls, TX
* Gulf Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railway (1887) (now a part of BNSF) – route: Fort Worth to Oklahoma City

These turned into major railroads:
* Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad (MKT) is now the Union Pacific, but the lines owned in Gainesville were abandoned long before the UP bought the MKT in 1988. The MKT through town was abandoned around 1969 after having providing service for 90 years.
* Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) is now the BNSF Railway.

Originally established as Weber Aircraft, LLC, in 1968, the company was subsequently acquired by Group Zodiac Aerospace and became known as Zodiac Seats U.S. In 2018, Zodiac Aerospace and its subsidiaries (including Zodiac Seats U.S.) were purchased by Safran, a French multinational aircraft engine, rocket engine, aerospace-component, and defense company with headquarters in Paris, France. Since its inception, SSUSA has consistently ranked as one of the largest manufacturers of commercial airline seats in the world, as well as the holder of several notable patents for products created by its employees.

Though most forms of gambling are not legal in Texas, Gainesville is commonly associated with the pastime due to its close proximity to WinStar World Casino. The casino, located less than north of Gainesville across the Red River in Thackerville, Oklahoma, has experienced exponential growth over the last decade, and is now considered one of the largest casinos in the world by total area. At over a mile long from end to end, the casino contains four hotel towers, a convention center, and as of September 2023 the Lucas Oil Live venue which host popular musical acts and comedians, as well as an 18-hole golf course. Until the construction of the WinStar World Casino Resort and Hotel, casino visitors typically stayed in Gainesville-area hotels. The convention center and/or the Lucas Oil Live venue will host World Series of Poker tournaments in the coming years.

Gainesville is home to a large outlet mall (the Gainesville Factory Shops) which used to attract visitors from North Texas and southern Oklahoma. Constructed in the mid-1990s as a &quot;destination&quot; shopping mall, it has since become a distressed mall, with very few stores remaining in 2016. In 2018 the Property re-launched as Market Days at Liberty Crossing; a multi-use space which hosts a monthly market and numerous retail shops.

==Community government and amenities==
Lake Kiowa is governed by the Lake Kiowa Property Owners Association, which is owned by the property owners themselves as the community is almost totally built out (all lots previously owned by the developers were sold as of 2017; the only vacant lots remaining are owned by private individuals).

The Association is led by a nine-member elected board of directors, with each director serving a three-year term. The terms are offset with three directors up for election each year. The Association maintains the community&#x27;s amenities as well as its roads (the community&#x27;s main road, Kiowa Drive, loops around the lake and crosses over its dam).

The Association provides private security, limited to writing speeding/parking tickets and enforcing community rules. Police protection is provided by the Cooke County Sheriff&#x27;s Department and, to a lesser extent, the nearby Gainesville Police Department. Fire and emergency services are provided by the Indian Creek Volunteer Fire Department which serves Lake Kiowa and the surrounding area.

The Lake Kiowa Special Utility District maintains the water supply. Trash pickup is provided by the Association through a private contractor (recycling is no longer offered as of 2018, outside of aluminum can donation sites for the local Kiwanis Club). Sewer service is not available; homes must install and maintain an operative septic system.

The Callisburg Independent School District serves students residing in Lake Kiowa.

==Amenities==
The Association owns the amenities offered by the community, which are centered around its namesake lake (a private lake). The lake is large enough for skiing, tubing, and other controlled boating activities, though wake boats must disable their ballast system to prevent damage to private boat docks and sea walls. Fishing is permitted and abundant fish reside in the lake; the Lake Kiowa Anglers and Conservation Club maintains the small and large fishing areas provided.

In addition, the Association also operates a private 18-hole golf course. Two different beach areas offer swimming, volleyball, tennis, and other opportunities. Each beach has picnic areas and a large pavilion is located at the Lodge (the community clubhouse and restaurant/bar). A nine-hole disc golf course is also available.

<text>Muenster ( ) is a city in western Cooke County, Texas, United States, along U.S. Route 82. The population was 1,536 at the 2020 census. Muenster is a primarily German-Texan city.

==History==

In 1887, Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad constructed a line from Gainesville to Henrietta that passed through the site that would become Muenster. The town was subsequently founded in 1889 by German Catholic settlers Carl and Emil Flusche, who invited other German Catholics to join them. The town was originally to be called &quot;Westphalia&quot;, but since the name Westphalia, Texas, was already taken, Muenster was selected instead in honor of Münster, the capital of Westphalia, but these cities are not sister-cities.

Many residents still spoke German in day-to-day life up until the First World War, after which the language was no longer taught in the schools and steadily declined in use.

With more than 90% of the population German and Catholic, the city has preserved many German customs, and still produces traditional foods at the local meat market and &quot;Bäckerei&quot;. An annual festival in April, Germanfest, includes beer, BBQ, German food, music, and bike and footraces. A &quot;Christkindlmarkt&quot; is held each year on Thanksgiving weekend.

Catholicism was so important to the early settlers that they built a school before a church was ever established. That school, Sacred Heart Catholic School, still exists today (one of only three high schools in the Fort Worth Diocese), along with the public Muenster Independent School District.

<text>Valley View is a city in Cooke County, Texas, United States. Its population was 737 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The town was first settled in 1870 by the Lee family. L.W. Lee plotted a town on his land in 1872, naming it &quot;Valley View&quot;, presumably for the view offered at the site of Spring Creek valley. Eighteen families moved in, and a post office opened in the community that same year.
A blacksmith shop was opened in 1873, and the shop was used for the community&#x27;s first school. By 1884, the town had an estimated 250 inhabitants, three steam gristmills and cotton gins, and three general stores, and it shipped cotton, livestock, and wheat. 
The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway (now the BNSF Railway) reached the town in 1886. Valley View had four church buildings and a hotel by 1890, and the Valley View Independent School District was incorporated in 1902. In 1903, the town witnessed dramatic growth with the completion of a two-story brick school house and six brick business buildings, the arrival of telephone service, and the opening of a bank. The following year the &quot;Valley View News&quot; began publishing weekly. The community had an estimated population of 600 by 1914.

Two fires struck the town in 1924. In the fall of 1940, the east side of the town square was burned down. On the morning of December 19, bank robbers started a second fire as they robbed the First National Bank (later named the Valley View National Bank and was owned by Thomas R. Couch) of $5,000. A further two city blocks were destroyed.

Valley View&#x27;s population was estimated at 700 from the 1920s through the mid-1960s. In 1970, it was 805, but the town declined during the next decade. When Valley View formally incorporated in 1980, it had 514 inhabitants and six businesses. The town began to grow again in the 1980s and had a population of 640 in 1990.

==Prisons==
Gatesville is the home of several prisons operated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, including the Patrick O&#x27;Daniel Unit, which houses the women&#x27;s death row. Gatesville is located on the northern edge of Fort Cavazos, and as such is also dependent on the military for a part of its economy (besides Fort Cavazos, a large military vehicle repair facility is located on the east side of town).

As of 2012, the prisons in the Gatesville area employ 2,600 people. Most of the employees live in Coryell County. Timothy F. Orwig (born 1949) of the &quot;Cove Herald&quot; said, &quot;Correctional officers in gray uniforms have been a common sight in the town&#x27;s businesses for years, and the job of a &#x27;prison boss&#x27; was once a highly regarded career choice in Gatesville.&quot;

Of the eight Texas Department of Criminal Justice general correctional facilities for women, which include five prisons and three state jails, four prisons and one state jail are in within the city limits.

The Christina Melton Crain Unit prison (formerly Gatesville Unit), the Hilltop Unit prison, the Dr. Lane Murray Unit prison, and the Linda Woodman Unit state jail are co-located among one another. In addition the Patrick O&#x27;Daniel Unit, a prison with the State of Texas female death row, is in Gatesville. One prison for males, the Alfred D. Hughes Unit, is in Gatesville.

<text>Crane is a city in and the county seat of Crane County, Texas, United States. Its population was 3,478 as of 2020. An oil boomtown since the 1920s, Crane is still in the center of a prominent oil-producing region. It is the only significant town in sparsely populated Crane County, and contains the only post office in the county.

==History==
While the post office dates from 1908, the discovery of oil in 1926 in the Permian Basin brought in enough fortune-seekers to populate a town. Streets are named for the children of O.C. Kinnison, the realtor who drew up the town map. By 1930, Crane was a full-fledged boomtown, with churches and private businesses operating next to the more nefarious elements of frontier life. As in other oil boomtowns, development of services lagged behind temporary dwellings for the workers, although paved roads and other basic infrastructure were added following incorporation in the early 1930s.

Peak population as reported by the U.S. Census was in 1960 at 3,796, and it has declined slightly since, although the town remains the center for serving the oil fields in Crane County.

The Museum of the Desert Southwest, the area&#x27;s museum of local history, is operated by the Crane County Historical Commission.

James Judson Van Horn who commanded an army garrison at the Van Horn Wells beginning in 1859. Lt. Van Horn&#x27;s command was relatively short-lived, as the post was seized by Confederate forces in 1861 and Lt. Van Horn taken prisoner. Settlement was further stimulated by the construction of the Texas and Pacific Railway in 1881.

<text>Texline is a town in northwestern Dallam County, Texas, United States. Its population was 448 at the 2020 census. The town is named for its location near the New Mexico-Texas state line. The town sits on U.S. Highway 87, which continues southeast towards Dalhart and northwest towards Clayton, New Mexico.

==History of boundary dispute==
For years, a simmering dispute has existed over whether Texline is lawfully a part of Texas or New Mexico. The straight north-south border between the two states was originally defined as the 103rd meridian, but the 1859 survey that was supposed to mark that boundary mistakenly set the border between too far west of that line. This survey error resulted in the current towns of Texline, Farwell, Bledsoe, Bronco, and a part of Glenrio being within the State of Texas. New Mexico&#x27;s short border with Oklahoma, in contrast, was correctly surveyed on the meridian. New Mexico&#x27;s draft constitution in 1910 stated that the border is on the 103rd meridian as intended. The disputed strip, hundreds of miles long, includes parts of valuable oilfields of the Permian Basin. A bill was passed in the New Mexico Senate to fund and file a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court to recover the strip from Texas, but the bill did not become law. Today, land in the strip is included in Texas land surveys and the land and towns for all purposes are taxed and governed by the State of Texas.

==Geography==

Texline is located just over a mile from the New Mexico border along U.S. Highway 87 and six miles south of the Texas-Oklahoma border. Dalhart is around 35 miles to the southeast and Clayton, New Mexico, is about 11 miles to the northwest.

<doc id="135743" wikidata="Q353089" url="?curid=135743" title="Addison, Texas">
<text>Addison is an incorporated town in Dallas County, Texas, United States. Addison is situated to the immediate north of the city of Dallas, with a 2020 census population of 16,661.

Addison and Flower Mound were the only two Texas municipalities labeled &quot;towns&quot; with a population greater than 10,000 at the 2010 census; since then the municipalities of Prosper and Trophy Club—also identifying as towns—have also exceeded 10,000 in population estimates.

==History==
Addison was originally part of Peter&#x27;s Colony. The future town site was settled as early as 1846 when Preston Witt built a house near White Rock Creek. In 1849, the Witt family opened a gristmill. In 1880, settler Sidney Smith Noell purchased a large tract of land south of what is now Belt Line Road. In 1888, Noell, together with W.W. Julian and W. E. Horten, donated land to the St. Louis, Arkansas and Texas Railway, a predecessor of the St. Louis Southwestern Railway (known as the Cotton Belt), for a coaling station.

The first substantial industry in the community was a cotton gin, opening in 1902. In 1903, the Cotton Belt built a depot and a  branch line leading south to Dallas, named the site Noell Junction, and started passenger train service from the small depot to the city. In 1904, a post office opened; however, there was already a community named Noell in Leon County, Texas, so the new community changed its name to Addison, after Addison Robertson, a local resident who would later serve as the community&#x27;s second postmaster from 1908 to 1916. Also in 1904, Julian platted the first six city blocks.

The population grew to 75 by 1914, at which time the community had three grocers and a bank, but the bank later failed and the population fell to 40 in 1926. After World War II, residents grew concerned that the nearby cities of Dallas, Carrollton, or Farmers Branch might annex the community, so they petitioned the county to allow an election for incorporation. The election was held on June 15, 1953, and by a vote of 19 in favor and 11 against, Addison was incorporated as a city.

In 1955, W.T. Overton, a 28-year-old businessman from Dallas, purchased a large farm north of the Cotton Belt depot, and in January 1956, he announced that the site would be redeveloped as an airport focused on business aircraft. After obtaining final approval from the city, Addison Airport had its formal groundbreaking ceremony on March 16, 1957, and its grand opening took place on October 18 of that year.

At the time, Addison residents relied almost entirely on private wells for water. Overton and his investors realized that a private well would not support their development plans, so they petitioned the city to drill a municipal well and build its first public water system. The project was approved by voters in April 1957 and construction began in August. The well was later supplemented by a large water main extended from Dallas.

In 1961, an investment group including Overton, John D. Murchison (son of oil magnate Clint Murchison Sr.), and Dallas-area developer Trammell Crow opened a industrial park in the triangular area formed by the Cotton Belt, Dooley Road, and the main Addison Airport runway.

In 1970, the city had 595 residents and eighty businesses. That decade, the local government heavily promoted industrial development. In 1976, residents voted to allow the sale of alcoholic beverages, which was prohibited in most of Dallas County and nearby Collin County; together with low taxes, this prompted many restaurants and hotels to open in the city. The town grew very quickly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. By 1986, there were 49 restaurants in town; in 1991, there were 118, and the population had grown to over 8,000. From 1989 through 1991, Addison hosted the Dallas Grand Prix.

In 1982 the name of the city was changed to the &quot;Town of Addison&quot;.

The Addison Airport Toll Tunnel, a three-year, $26.8 million project to relieve traffic on Belt Line Road, was completed in February 1999, restoring the continuity of Keller Springs Road 42 years after it was severed by the construction of Addison Airport.

==Education==

The Addison School building was opened in 1914. In 1954 the school became a part of the Dallas ISD, and the school closed in 1964. The school building is now the &quot;Magic Time Machine Restaurant.&quot;

McLaughlin was built in 1959. Field was built in 1960. Stark opened in 1963. R. L. Turner High School opened in 1962, replacing Carrollton High School.

Prior to fall 2006, all Addison residents were zoned to Frank for Kindergarten through 4th Grade, E. D. Walker Elementary School for 5th and 6th grades, and Marsh Middle School for 7th and 8th grades. Junkins Elementary School opened in fall 2006, relieving Anne Frank, and Tom C. Gooch Elementary School took an additional portion of Frank&#x27;s attendance zone. During the same year, Walker became a middle school, serving the Frank and Junkins-zoned sections of Addison, while the Gooch-zoned section was still assigned to Marsh.

In fall 2008 boundary changes rezoned the Frank-zoned section of Addison from W. T. White and Walker to Hillcrest and Franklin. In addition, Strickland was dedicated in 2008.

George Herbert Walker Bush Elementary School opened in Addison in 2011. As a result, boundary changes during that year involve Bush taking attendance zone territory from Tom C. Gooch, Frank, and Junkins elementary schools. Because of Bush&#x27;s opening, now Walker MS and White MS served the Junkins and Bush zones, while Franklin continued to serve the Frank zone. Because Gooch is no longer serving portions of Addison, Marsh Middle School no longer serves portions of Addison.

===Public schools===

Most residents are zoned to the Dallas Independent School District, while those on the southern end of Spring Valley and Vitruvian Way are zoned to the Carrollton-Farmers Branch Independent School District.

All residents within the DISD portion of Addison may attend George H. W. Bush Elementary School in Addison. Bush&#x27;s attendance boundary covers most of Addison. DISD Addison residents living outside of the Bush attendance boundary are not provided transportation to attend Bush. Other DISD elementary schools serving sections of Addison include Anne Frank Elementary School in Dallas and Jerry Junkins Elementary School in Carrollton.

The Town of Addison asked Dallas ISD to build Bush with environmentally sensitive materials. The PreK–5 school was built as part of a bond approved in May 2008. Bush is adjacent to the Greenhill School and is located along Addison&#x27;s trail system; therefore the school will be accessible by bicycle or on foot from the Les Lacs and Midway Meadows subdivisions. Bush has a first floor with of space and a second floor with of space. Bush has two athletic fields located north of the playgrounds. During non-school hours Addison residents may use the fields.

Residents zoned to Bush and Junkins are zoned to Walker Middle School and W.T. White High School in Dallas. Residents zoned to Frank are zoned to Benjamin Franklin Middle School and Hillcrest High School.

A portion of the C-FBISD area is served by Stark Elementary School in Farmers Branch. Another portion is served by Neil Ray McLaughlin Elementary School (K–2) in Carrollton and Nancy H. Strickland Intermediate School (3–5) in Farmers Branch. All of the C-FBISD portion is served by Vivian Field Middle School in Farmers Branch, and R. L. Turner High School in Carrollton.

<text>Balch Springs ( , ) is a city in Dallas County, Texas, United States. It is an inner-ring suburb of Dallas and part of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Its population was 23,728 at the 2010 census, and 25,007 at 2019&#x27;s census estimates.

==History==

The area was first settled in the 1840s. Around 1879, John M. Balch and his family settled south of Mesquite in unincorporated Dallas County. Mr. Balch found several springs on his land, one of which ran year-round. Local residents began referring to the springs on Mr. Balch&#x27;s property as Balch Springs, and use of the name continued even after he moved away a few years after his arrival. Around 1885, a county school was named after the springs. A small church and a cemetery were near the school. During the early 1900s, the community was widely dispersed and consisted mostly of farms. Electricity, provided by Texas Power and Light, was introduced in 1939. Gas and telephone service arrived shortly after World War II.

The community began to grow rapidly along with the city of Dallas and other Dallas County towns. To avoid annexation by Dallas, Balch Springs incorporated as a city on June 13, 1953. The new city encompassed the communities of Balch Springs, Zipp City, Five Points, Jonesville, and Triangle, as well as portions of Rylie and Kleberg. A mayor-council form of government was adopted after incorporation. By 1956, Balch Springs had a population around 3,500. The city was home to 6,821 residents at the 1960 census. In September 1964, a post office opened in the city and in 1965, the first taxes were levied. A 1966 attempt to disincorporate the community was unsuccessful. By 1970, the population had risen to 10,464 as the construction of new roads made commuting to surrounding cities easier. In 1988, residents voted to become part of the neighboring city of Mesquite, but the election was declared invalid. Two years later, the 1990 census reported a total of 17,406 people living in the city. The 2000 population was 19,375.

The murder of Jordan Edwards occurred in Balch Springs in 2017.

==Geography==

Balch Springs is situated approximately east of downtown Dallas and southeast of the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. The city is bordered by Mesquite to the north and east, and Dallas to the south and west.

Major highways running through Balch Springs include Interstate 635, which bisects the city into two nearly equal halves. Interstate 20 and U.S. Highway 175 run along Balch Springs&#x27; southern border.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.27%, is covered by water.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, 27,685 people, 6,916 households, and 5,522 families resided in the city.

== Government ==
Balch Springs has a mayor-council form of government, with a mayor and six council members. Five of the six are elected in single-member districts, while the mayor and remaining council member are elected at-large.

<text>Cockrell Hill is a city in Dallas County, Texas, United States. The population was 4,193 at the 2010 census, and 3,815 in 2020. It is completely surrounded by the city of Dallas.

==History==

Cockrell Hill was established by the pioneer Brentwood Allen Cockrell and his son, Woodrow. They established the town as a way of making a living, and ran it like a business. The Cockrell place was known to travelers on the stage line that ran from Dallas to Fort Belknap and on to El Paso and the west. The settlement developed as an agricultural crossroads and by the late 1800s had a few scattered homes, a small store, and a school. Water became the overriding issue for the town&#x27;s continued growth. Frank Jester, a local developer, laid out the plan for the modern community of Cockrell Hill in 1911. A first attempt at incorporation in 1925 proved unsuccessful, and the following year a vote to disincorporate was approved. The second incorporation passed on July 21, 1937, when the population was 459. The town grew to a population of 1,246 in 1941. Many of the new residents worked in war-related industries located in the surrounding areas. In 1952 the population was 2,194, in 1990 it was 3,916, and in 2000 it was 4,445.In May 2006, Councilman Luis D. Carrera defeated C. P. Slayton and John Mendiola defeated Richard Hall and joined Silvia Ulloa, Richard Perez and Sammy Rodriquez to become the first all-Hispanic City Council in North Texas.

Officer Hickey was the passenger in the patrol car, being driven by her field training officer (FTO), when they attempted to stop a vehicle for speeding and running a red light. Officer Hickey radioed dispatch to notify them of the chase but, due to an antiquated radio system, dispatch never heard the call because another officer was transmitting. Approximately three minutes later the FTO swerved to avoid another vehicle in an intersection and struck a light pole. Officer Hickey remained in serious condition before succumbing to her injuries. Officer Hickey had served with the agency for only 1 month.

<text>DeSoto is a city in Dallas County, Texas, United States. DeSoto is a suburb of Dallas and is part of the Best Southwest area, which includes DeSoto, Cedar Hill, Duncanville, and Lancaster.

== History ==

The area was first settled in 1847, making it one of the oldest communities in North Texas. A post office was established in 1881, and the settlement was named DeSoto in honor of Thomas Hernando DeSoto Stewart, a doctor dedicated to the community. By 1885, DeSoto was home to around 120 people, a cotton gin, and a general store. Soon after, the population declined to below 50. In 1930, 97 people were living in the community, with several businesses.
After World War II, DeSoto and surrounding areas began to grow. To improve the inadequate water distribution system, residents felt the need to incorporate the town. On February 17, 1949, a petition signed by 42 eligible voters was presented to the Dallas County judge requesting an election for incorporation. The vote took place on March 2. Of the 52 people who cast ballots, 50 voted in favor of incorporation and two were opposed. On March 3, 1949, the results were entered into the records of the Dallas County Commissioners Court, thereby creating the City of DeSoto. The new city was less than one square mile in size. On March 15, Wayne A. Chowning was elected mayor along with five aldermen. The first city council meeting was held two days later.

The first census conducted after DeSoto&#x27;s incorporation occurred in 1950. eight businesses and 298 people were in the city. Following a series of annexations in 1953, the city covered around . By 1960, the population had grown to 1,969. In 1970, DeSoto was home to 6,617 people and 71 businesses.

During the 1970s, continued growth brought about improvements to the municipal infrastructure, including road construction, and a new water/sewage system. Industrial, commercial, and residential construction also increased. On October 26, 1974, an election was held to determine the status of Woodland Hills, a small, incorporated community located northwest of DeSoto. The result was 221 votes in favor of a merger with DeSoto and 219 opposed. Woodland Hills had a population of 366 at the time of annexation. The rapid growth that began in the early 1970s was sustained throughout the 1980s; 1980 census figures put the city&#x27;s population at slightly over 15,000. By 1984, DeSoto had a total of 360 businesses, up from 168 in 1980.

The population surpassed 30,000 in 1990. City development progressed in the following years. A primary example of this was the creation of DeSoto&#x27;s Town Center. Officials converted an abandoned strip center located at one of the city&#x27;s main intersections into a unique central business district. Since its opening, the Town Center has become an anchor of the community, housing city hall, the public library, a civic center, recreation cente, and a 180-seat auditorium and outdoor amphitheater.

Throughout the 1990s, DeSoto experienced a significant change in the demographic composition of the city. In the 1990 census, Whites comprised 75.97% of the city&#x27;s population, but that figure had declined to 48.83% in the 2000 census, and 17.4% non-Hispanic White by 2010. By contrast, the African American population grew rapidly. In 2000, African Americans were 45.53% of the population, up from 20.83% in 1990. Hispanics accounted for 4.98% of the population in 1990 and 7.30% in 2000. With roughly 45,500 residents as of 2005, DeSoto is the largest and most diverse city in southwest Dallas County.

On June 11, 2006, the National Civic League named DeSoto an &quot;All-America City&quot;. The All-America City Award is the nation&#x27;s oldest community-recognition program and recognizes communities whose citizens work together to identify and tackle community-wide challenges and achieve uncommon results.

A 2015 article related a growing trend of largely middle class and educated African Americans moving to DeSoto.

<text>Duncanville is a city in southwestern Dallas County, Texas, United States. Duncanville&#x27;s population was 40,706 at the 2020 census. The city is part of the Best Southwest area, which includes Duncanville, Cedar Hill, DeSoto, and Lancaster.

==History==
Settlement of the area began in 1845, when Illinois resident Crawford Trees purchased several thousand acres south of Camp Dallas. In 1880, the Chicago, Texas, and Mexican Central Railway reached the area and built Duncan Switch, named for a line foreman. Charles P. Nance, the community&#x27;s first postmaster, renamed the settlement Duncanville in 1882. By the late 19th century, Duncanville was home to a dry-goods stores, a pharmacy, a domino parlor, and a school. Between 1904 and 1933, the population of Duncanville increased from 113 to more than 300.

During World War II, the Army Air Corps established a landing field for flight training on property near the present-day intersection of Main St and Wheatland Road.

Duncanville residents incorporated the city on August 2, 1947. During the postwar years, the military developed the Army&#x27;s old landing field into the Duncanville Air Force Station, which was the headquarters for the four Nike-Hercules missile launch sites guarding Dallas/Fort Worth from Soviet bomber attack. It also housed the Air Force tracking radars for the region.

When the town&#x27;s population reached 5,000 in 1962, citizens adopted a home-rule charter with council-manager city government. Sometimes regarded as a &quot;white flight&quot; suburb in the 1960s and 1970s, the city is now known for its racial diversity. Its population increased from about 13,000 in 1970 to more than 31,000 in 1988.

===Historic preservation===
The Texas Historical Commission has designated the City of Duncanville as an official Main Street City.

Duncanville recognizes the importance of the former Duncanville Air Force Station, which closed on July 1, 1964, but the Army continued to operate the Nike Missile air defense operations until 1969, when the facility was turned over to the city. The WWII-era barracks and some other structures were initially repurposed for civic and community use. Over time, the buildings were systematically demolished, removing all signs of the historic base, but the history of the facility lives on in a monument that stands outside the library and community center.

The &quot;stone igloo&quot;, a spring house originally located near the intersection of Center Street and Cedar Ridge Road, was preserved in a unique way. In the late 1960s or early 1970s, it was demolished, thereby producing a supply of rocks used to build a replica of the structure at a nearby park and paving the way for the construction of a neighborhood retail center.

Various pieces of the city&#x27;s history are preserved at the Duncanville Historical Park, which is located on Wheatland Road in Armstrong Park on land that was once a part of the Duncanville Air Force Station. Historic buildings include the city&#x27;s first Music Room.

==Geography==

<text>Farmers Branch, officially the City of Farmers Branch, is a city in Dallas County, Texas, United States. It is an inner-ring suburb of Dallas and is part of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Its population was 35,991 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The community was first settled in the early 1850s. In 1842, Thomas Keenan, Isaac B. Webb, and William Cochran received original land grants in the area. By 1843, a community called Mustang Branch had been established. Mr. Cochran later changed the name to Farmers Branch to reflect the area&#x27;s rich soil and farmland. Farmers Branch was the first location of the Texan Land and Emigration Company (or Peters Colony) in 1845. This made the community one of the best-known places in Dallas County during the 1840s because of its advertising throughout Europe and the United States. Baptist minister William Bowles opened a blacksmith shop and gristmill in 1845. On May 5, 1845, Isaac B. Webb donated land for Webb&#x27;s Chapel Methodist Church, the first formal place of worship in Dallas County. A school was established in the church one year later. Webb became the first postmaster at the Farmers Branch post office, which opened on January 5, 1848. It continued to function until its closure in 1866. The post office reopened in 1875. To assure that railroads would eventually pass through Farmers Branch, prominent early settler Samuel Gilbert and others sold right-of-way through their land in 1874. Around three to four years later, the Dallas and Wichita Railway completed a track from Dallas—through Farmers Branch—to Lewisville. It was absorbed by the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad in 1881. The community had a population around 100 by 1890, with several businesses. The population had grown to 300 during the early 1900s. A brick school building was constructed in 1916. The number of people living in the community remained stable until after World War II.

Farmers Branch was incorporated as a city after an election was held on February 23, 1946. William F. (Bill) Dodson was elected as the city&#x27;s first mayor. The implementation of city services began immediately after incorporation. In the 1950 census, Farmers Branch had a population of 915. In 1956, a home-rule charter was approved that adopted a council-manager form of government. The rapid growth of the city during the 1950s was made apparent in the 1960 census, which recorded a total of 13,441 residents, a 1,369% increase over the 1950 figure. Most of the new residents commuted to nearby Dallas for employment. The population topped 27,000 by 1970. A variety of manufacturers producing items such as steel products, concrete, asphalt, cosmetics, and food products was operating in the city. The number of residents declined to 24,863 in 1980 and 24,250 in 1990. The falling population was offset, however, by the wide variety of businesses located in the city. Farmers Branch is home to a large number of corporations that have attained frontage along Interstate 635, the Dallas North Tollway, and Interstate 35E. Its Dallas North Tollway segment is part of the Platinum Corridor, and its land along Interstate 635 is an extension of the lengthy Irving Prairie office park.

===Education===

====Public school districts====

Residential areas in Farmers Branch are within two school districts.

Most of Farmers Branch is a part of the Carrollton-Farmers Branch Independent School District. Dave Blair Elementary School, Farmers Branch Elementary School, Janie Stark Elementary School, and Nancy H. Strickland Intermediate School (3–5) are in Farmers Branch. Sections zoned to Strickland for grades 3–5 are zoned to Neil Ray McLaughlin Elementary School (K–2) in Carrollton Vivian C. Field Middle School is in Farmers Branch and serves almost all of the CFBISD portion. R. L. Turner High School in Carrollton also serves almost all of CFBISD Farmers Branch. Residential areas south of Interstate 635 and west of Interstate 35E are zoned to La Villita Elementary School, Barbara Bush Middle School and Ranchview High School in Irving. CFBISD&#x27;s Early College High School, an alternative high school, is on the property of Brookhaven College.

Dallas Independent School District also serves a small portion of Farmers Branch. One DISD elementary school, Chapel Hill Preparatory School, known as William L. Cabell Elementary School until its 2018 renaming, is in Farmers Branch. Its current name is a reference to the Chapel Hill community; it was renamed since the former namesake, Mayor of Dallas William Lewis Cabell, served in the Confederate States of America. Other residential portions of DISD Farmers Branch are served by Gooch Elementary. Residential areas in DISD are zoned to Marsh Middle School and W.T. White High School.

Mayor Tim O&#x27;Hare proposed making a new municipal Farmers Branch school district with the portions currently in CFBISD and DISD. In 2011, about 66% of voters decided against the referendum. At the time, the city did not have the 8,000 children required under Texas law as a requirement for forming a new district, so KTVT stated, &quot;Even if the proposal had passed, there would have been little, if anything, the city could have done to move forward&quot;.

====Private schools====

Mary Immaculate Catholic School, a part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas, is in Farmers Branch. In addition, German International School of Dallas, established in 2009 and serving preschool and elementary school, is in the city limits.

The Texas Legislature defines all of Dallas County (Farmers Branch included) as in the service area of Dallas College, as well as all of CFBISD. Brookhaven College of Dallas College is in the Farmers Branch city limits.

Additionally Farmers Branch is home to Dallas Christian College, a four-year Bible college.

====Weekend supplementary education====

The Japanese School of Dallas, a supplementary Japanese school, previously had its main office in Farmers Branch. The school conducts its classes at Ted Polk Middle School in Carrollton. On Monday July 25, 2016 the Japanese Association and the Japanese School offices moved to a new location in Dallas. The classroom location remained the same.

==Transportation==

Farmers Branch was one of fifteen cities to approve services of Dallas Area Rapid Transit in 1983 by levying a 1 cent sales tax. The city currently receives DART bus service, with service to downtown Dallas (by both regular route and express bus), the adjacent suburb of Carrollton, and crosstown routes as well. On December 6, 2010, the city received light rail transit service with a station near the northeast corner of Interstates 635 and 35E on the , which runs from Pleasant Grove in southeast Dallas through downtown Dallas following I-35E up to Carrollton at Frankford Road.

<doc id="135750" wikidata="Q591899" url="?curid=135750" title="Highland Park, Texas">
<text>Highland Park is a town in central Dallas County, Texas, United States. The population was estimated to be 8,719 in 2022, dropping from the previously recorded 8,864 in 2020. It is located between the Dallas North Tollway and U.S. Route 75 (North Central Expressway), north of downtown Dallas.

Highland Park is bordered on the south, east and west by Dallas and on the north by the city of University Park. Highland Park and University Park together comprise the Park Cities, an enclave of Dallas.

==History==

 The land now known as Highland Park was bought in 1889 by a group of investors from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, known as the Philadelphia Place Land Association, for an average price of $377 an acre, with a total of $500,000. Henry Exall, an agent, intended to develop the land along Turtle Creek as &quot;Philadelphia Place&quot;, exclusive housing based on parkland areas in Philadelphia. He laid gravel roads, and dammed Turtle Creek, forming Exall Lake, before the Panic of 1893 brought a blow to his fortunes, halting development. Afterwards, he began a horse breeding farm. In the 1890s, Exall Lake was a common picnic destination for Dallas residents.

In 1906, John S. Armstrong (the former partner of Thomas Marsalis, the developer of Oak Cliff), sold his meatpacking business and invested his money in a portion of the former Philadelphia Place land, to develop it under the name of &quot;Highland Park&quot;. He chose this name as it was located on high land that overlooked downtown Dallas. Wilbur David Cook, the landscape designer who had planned Beverly Hills, California, and George E. Kessler, who had previously planned Fair Park and most of downtown Dallas, were hired to design its layout in 1907. Notably, twenty percent of the original land was set aside for parks. A second development in Highland Park was developed in 1910.

In 1913, Highland Park petitioned Dallas for annexation, but was refused. The 500 residents voted to incorporate on November 29, 1913, and incorporation was granted in 1915, when its population was 1,100. The first mayor of Highland Park was W. A. Fraser. A third and fourth development were added to the town in 1915 and 1917, respectively. In 1919, the city of Dallas sought to annex Highland Park, beginning a lengthy controversy that lasted until 1945. J. W. Bartholow and William Chloupek led the fight to resist the annexation. The final major land development occurred in 1924. In 1931, Highland Park Village was constructed, the first shopping center of its kind in the United States.

Because of its location near Dallas, Highland Park had, by the early 1930s, developed a moderately large (8,400) population, with a few businesses. Eventually the school districts and newspapers of Highland Park and University Park were combined. In the 1940s, after the failure to annex Highland Park, Dallas began annexing the land surrounding it. Reaching a population high of just under 13,000 in the late 1950s, Highland Park afterwards grew only by building houses on the remaining vacant lots, and by the destruction of old buildings. Since 1990, Highland Park has maintained strict zoning ordinances.

The Highland Park Public Library is adjacent to the Highland Park Town Hall. The library building and art gallery first opened in 1930. As time passed, the art gallery was repurposed as town council chambers and a portion of the library. In 2008 the library underwent major renovations.

===In television===
The television show &quot;Dallas&quot; used Highland Park as a filming location.

==Infrastructure==
The town council authorized the purchasing of a fire engine and the construction of a fire house after the 1913 incorporation. The town hall was built in 1924. During the same year, a new fire station opened next to town hall. The town hall has received several renovations. Connected the town hall is the public safety building. In 2003 a portion of the public safety building was razed, and a new facility was built in its place.

Highland Park employs a public safety department instead of separate police and fire/EMS departments. The public safety officers are certified as firefighters, peace officers, and paramedics. They work 24-hour shifts (with the next two days off), varying their role during the shift. EMS medical direction is provided by the BioTel system through UT-Southwestern Medical School, which provides this service to the majority of fire/EMS departments in Dallas County.

<text>Hutchins is a city in Dallas County, Texas, United States. Its population was 5,607 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area was first inhabited by families around 1860 as a trading place for immigrants who settled along the west bank of the Trinity River and new arrivals who crossed the Trinity at Dowd&#x27;s Ferry from the east.

The town received its name from railroad developer William J. Hutchins, who was then president and general manager of the Houston and Texas Central Railroad (H&amp;TC). The railway was completed through Hutchins in 1872. That same year a post office opened in the community. The population of Hutchins grew to around 250 residents in 1884 and topped 300 by 1890. That figure declined slightly to 204 in 1904, but had risen to 500 in 1926.

Hutchins was officially incorporated in 1945. In the first census conducted after incorporation in 1950, the population stood at 743. Despite the rapid growth of Dallas County and most of its suburban communities during the latter half of the 20th century, Hutchins has grown at a much slower pace and today is one of the smallest municipalities in the county. As of 2000, the city of Hutchins had 133 businesses and a population of 2,805. Many of the businesses in the city are industrial or manufacturing related. A number of its residents are employed in the city of Dallas.

==Geography==
Hutchins is located at (32.643784, –96.707538), about south of downtown Dallas. It is bordered by Dallas on the north and northwest, Lancaster on the southwest, Wilmer to the south, and the Trinity River to the east. Interstate Highways 20 and 45 pass through the city.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 2.35%, is covered by water.

Thomas Korosec of the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; wrote that the main street of Hutchins had &quot;a faded, smalltown feel&quot; due to the shops along it.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, 5,607 people, 970 households, and 654 families were residing in the city.

==Government and infrastructure==
The Texas Department of Criminal Justice operates the Hutchins State Jail for men in Hutchins.

== Education ==

=== Primary and secondary schools ===

Most of Hutchins is within the Dallas Independent School District (DISD). The area is within the Board of Trustees District 5.

As of fall 2011, the area is zoned to Wilmer-Hutchins Elementary School, Kennedy-Curry Middle School, and Wilmer-Hutchins High School.

A portion of Hutchins is within Lancaster Independent School District. The zoned high school of that section is Lancaster High School.

====School histories====

Most of Hutchins was served by the Wilmer-Hutchins Independent School District.

Until the end of the school district, C.S. Winn Elementary School was located in Hutchins. The Hutchins Academic Elementary School was also located in Hutchins. In 2004 the WHISD board voted to close Hutchins Academic, which had 82 students at the time of closure. the former students moved to C.S. Winn and Wilmer Elementary School in Wilmer in January 2005. In addition the Hutchins 5th Grade Center opened in 2000. In addition, Kennedy-Curry Middle School and Wilmer-Hutchins High School in Dallas, then under WHISD control, served Wilmer.

The DISD took over all of WHISD for the 2005–2006 school year. WHISD closed shortly afterwards, with official termination in spring 2006. After the closure of WHISD, property values in the district increased.

For the 2005–2006 school year until the 2010–2011 school year, the WHISD portion of Hutchins was served by several schools located in Dallas. In 2005–2006 and 2006–2007 they included J.P. Starks, Martin Weiss, and Whitney Young. From 2007–2008 to 2010–2011, the elementary schools serving Hutchins only included Martin Weiss and Whitney Young Elementary Schools (in two separate attendance zones).

From 2005 to 2006, until 2010-2011 secondary schools included Hulcy (Weiss zone) and Zumwalt Middle Schools (Starks and Young zones), and Carter High School (Weiss zone) and A. Maceo Smith High School (Starks and Young zones).

The Dallas ISD considered opening a new Wilmer-Hutchins Elementary School building, restoring the Wilmer-Hutchins High School building, and demolishing the Kennedy-Curry Middle School building as part of its 2008 bond campaign. The Wilmer Hutchins Elementary School will open in an area of the City of Dallas in 2011. In November 2010 DISD announced that three schools (Wilmer Hutchins ES, Kennedy-Curry Middle School, and Wilmer-Hutchins HS) would open/reopen in the Wilmer-Hutchins area in 2011.

=== Public libraries ===

The Atwell Public Library serves Hutchins.

=== Colleges and universities ===

Dallas County residents are zoned to Dallas College (formerly Dallas County Community College or DCCC).

<text>Irving is a city in Dallas County, Texas, United States. It is part of the Mid-Cities region of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex and is an inner city suburb of Dallas. Irving is noted for its racial and ethnic diversity. The city had a population of 256,684 according to the 2020 United States Census, making it the twelfth-most populous city in Texas, and the 88th most populous in the U.S. Irving includes the Las Colinas mixed-use master-planned community and part of the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.

==History==
Irving was founded in 1903 by J.O. &quot;Otto&quot; Schulze and Otis Brown. It is believed literary author Washington Irving was a favorite of Netta Barcus Brown, and consequently the name of the town site, Irving, was chosen. Irving began in 1889 as an area called Gorbit, and in 1894 the name changed to Kit. Irving was incorporated April 14, 1914, with Otis Brown as the first mayor.

By the late nineteenth century the Irving area was the site of churches, two cotton gins, a blacksmith shop and a general store. The Irving district public school system dates to the 1909 establishment of Kit and Lively schools. Population growth was slow and sometimes halting, with only 357 residents in 1925, but a significant increase began in the 1930s.

By the early 1960s the city had a population of approximately 45,000. A number of manufacturing plants operated in Irving, along with transportation, retail and financial businesses. The University of Dallas in Irving opened in 1956, and Texas Stadium was completed in 1971 as the home field of the Dallas Cowboys. The Chateau Theater opened in 1964 as part of a chain of premium, dollar, and drive-in theaters that stretched across North Texas and Oklahoma.

Delta Air Lines Flight 191 crashed in Irving on August 2, 1985.

==Government and infrastructure==

===Local government===
Prior to the November 2008 elections, Irving banned the sale of alcoholic beverages in stores, making it the largest in population dry suburb in North Texas. In 2004 the pro-alcohol measure failed with 63% of voters opposing the measure. In 2006, 52% voted against the measure. On the third attempt, with heavy monetary backing by retailers, voters narrowly voted in favor of the measure in 2008. People in favor of changing Irving&#x27;s liquor laws saw the interest in the 2008 United States Presidential Election as a catalyst for changing the laws in their favor.

In 2009 Irving had a city council that was entirely at-large. While Irving has a large population of racial minorities, the entire city council and the mayor&#x27;s office, was entirely non-Hispanic White. Manny Benavidez, a resident of Irving, filed a lawsuit against the city in federal court in November 2007, saying that the voting system was not in compliance with the 1965 Voting Rights Act. On July 15, 2009, a federal judge ruled that Irving is required to create a new electoral system so that racial minority representatives may be voted into office. In 2010 elections, which included one at-large seat and two district-seats, three new council members were elected, replacing two incumbents and adding a newly created seat. Among the three new council members were two minority council members.

<text>Lancaster ( ) is a city in Dallas County, Texas, United States. Its population was 41,275 according to the 2020 census. Founded in 1852 as a frontier post, Lancaster is one of Dallas County&#x27;s earliest settlements. Today, it is a suburban community located in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, about south of downtown Dallas.

Lancaster is part of the Best Southwest area, which includes Lancaster, Cedar Hill, DeSoto, and Duncanville.

== History ==
=== Early settlement ===
In 1841, an act of the Republic of Texas Congress authorized President Mirabeau Lamar to enter into a contract with William S. Peters and 19 associates to promote settlement in North Texas, and paid the company with free land in exchange for recruiting new settlers. Around 600 families settled in what became known as Peters Colony from 1841 through 1844. The Peters&#x27; group advertised heavily in Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, and Tennessee, so many of the earliest settlers were from those states. The first group to settle in the Lancaster area was Roderick Rawlins and his family from Greene County, Illinois. They left for Texas in September 1844. Rawlins and two of his sons-in-law came ahead to select the general area where they would settle. They chose an uninhabited area south of Dallas along the north bank of Ten Mile Creek as the site of their new settlement. In December 1844, the three men went back to Lamar County near the Red River to bring the rest of their wagon train. All of the settlers had arrived by January 2, 1845, and they formed a community known as Hardscrabble. It consisted of two rows of log cabins with a street running north and south. In total, 30 men, women, and children lived in Hardscrabble.

Several miles north of Hardscrabble, a second community called Pleasant Run was established in 1846 by Polly Rawlins, one of Roderick&#x27;s daughters, and her husband Madison Moultrie &quot;M.M.&quot; Miller. Together, the Millers built a two-room structure, with one room used as a general store and the other for living. By 1848, the structure had grown to 15 rooms, a separate store, and a warehouse. A post office was established with biweekly mail delivery and Miller as postmaster. By 1850, he had laid out a town and sold lots, but never filed a plat of the community with Dallas County. At its peak, Pleasant Run boasted a stage stop, school, and steam-powered grist mill in addition to Miller&#x27;s store. Accelerated by the death of M.M. Miller in 1860, Pleasant Run declined. Shortly after the Rawlins&#x27; settlers abandoned the Hardscrabble settlement, Lancaster became the dominant community in the area.

=== Founding of Lancaster ===
The founder of Lancaster was &quot;A&quot; Bledsoe (Some sources list his name as Abram Bledsoe. or Albert A. Bledsoe). He was born in Lancaster, Kentucky, in 1801. According to family lore, when his father Moses first looked at his newborn son, he is said to have remarked, &quot;he looks like a Bledsoe.&quot; Thus his name, A Bledsoe, is unmarked by a period.

Bledsoe surveyed and staked off the original town of Lancaster in 1852. He purchased 430 acres of land from the widow of Roderick Rawlins, and modeled it after his Kentucky hometown. The layout featured a town square with streets entering from the center of each side rather than from the corners. Bledsoe began selling lots at a public auction in 1853, reportedly giving as many as two-thirds of them to settlers from the nearby Pleasant Run community. The official plat of the town of Lancaster was not filed with Dallas County until 1857. Bledsoe later served as Dallas County judge and state comptroller. He died in 1882.

In 1860, a post office was established in Lancaster.

=== Progress and challenges ===

During the American Civil War, the Tucker, Sherrod &amp;and Company contracted with the State of Texas to manufacture replicas of the .44 caliber Colt Dragoon from a factory on West Main Street in Lancaster. John M. Crockett, former mayor of Dallas and lieutenant governor of Texas, served as superintendent of the arms factory. In the early years of Reconstruction, a drought crippled the economy to such an extent that few residents could afford more than the most basic of necessities. The economy did not fully recover until well into the 1870s, due in large part to the town&#x27;s proximity to heavily trafficked cattle trails. The first public well was dug in the city&#x27;s town square in 1876. Fires destroyed parts of the square in 1877, 1889, and again in 1918, each time being promptly rebuilt. Local telephone service came to Lancaster in 1881. Lancaster was incorporated on May 5, 1886. One year later, the &quot;Lancaster Herald&quot; newspaper began printing.

In December 1888, Lancaster&#x27;s train depot opened as a stop on the Dallas and Waco Railway. In 1891, it became part of the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad (MKT) line, running from Dallas to the Gulf Coast of Texas. The Lancaster Tap Railroad, completed in 1890, connected the MKT line in Lancaster with the Dallas-Houston line of the Houston and Texas Central Railway (H&amp;TC) in Hutchins, 4.5 miles away. It operated for 44 years. Rene Paul &quot;R.P.&quot; Henry opened the first official bank in 1889. By 1897, the town had a public school, Masonic Temple, a chapter of the International Order of Odd Fellows, and a variety of Christian churches. From 1898 to 1901, Texas Christian University founder Randolph Clark established Randolph College in Lancaster. After its closure, the facilities were used continuously until they burned in a 1912 fire.

=== Early 20th century ===
At the start of the 20th century, Lancaster had 1,045 residents and served hundreds more from the surrounding rural areas who worked, worshiped, attended school, and made their purchases in the town. The Texas Legislature created the Lancaster Independent School District in March 1905, and voters approved several bond elections over the next decade that improved educational facilities. Electric lighting was introduced in 1911 via the Texas Power and Light Company, when the interurban Texas Electric Railway (Dallas to Waco) ran through town. Lancaster remained tied to its surrounding agricultural lands. Farmers produced a wide range of crops, including wheat, cotton, beans, peas, and sweet potatoes. Many agricultural-related businesses also thrived until the Dust Bowl and Great Depression caused the economy to contract. On February 27, 1934, Clyde Barrow of Bonnie &amp; Clyde fame robbed the R.P. Henry and Sons Bank that was then located near the southeast corner of the town square. Bonnie Parker waited in the getaway car on Malloy Bridge Road while Clyde and Raymond Hamilton walked in, robbed the bank, and walked out with over $4,000. In June 1936, a storm toppled Lancaster&#x27;s 50,000-gallon water tower, brought down utility poles, and damaged many homes. In the early 1940s, the economic climate began to show improvement.

=== Suburbanization ===
Between 1900 and 1940, Lancaster&#x27;s population grew slowly, ranging between 1,000 and 1,200 at each census. In 1950, the population had risen to just over 2,600. Soon after, the growth rate rapidly increased as Lancaster began to transform from a small town into a suburban bedroom community of Dallas. By 1960, 7,501 residents were living in the city, a 185% increase over the 1950 figure. Highlights of the 1970s included a 1975 urban renewal project to improve the town square, which had suffered a loss of businesses to areas outside of downtown, and the opening of Cedar Valley College in 1977. Significant development continued into the 1980s. A hospital, two shopping centers, four schools, several apartment complexes, and a number of new residential subdivisions were built to accommodate the growing population.

=== Recent history ===

On the night of April 25, 1994, a violent F4 tornado ripped through Lancaster, killing three and injuring nearly 50 others. More than 250 homes and every building on the town square were heavily damaged or completely destroyed by the roughly half-mile-wide tornado. The White and Company Bank building, a local landmark since 1898, was severely damaged in the tornado, but was rebuilt, and in 1998, reopened as headquarters for the Lancaster Economic Development Corporation.

In 2005 and 2006, Lancaster was a finalist for the All-America City Award. In 2007 the National Arbor Day Foundation designated Lancaster a Tree City USA.

Between 2000 and 2010, Lancaster&#x27;s population increased by 40%, making it one of the fastest-growing cities in Dallas County during the decade.

On April 3, 2012, an EF-2 tornado struck the city as part of the tornado outbreak; 300 structures were reported damaged. A tornado emergency was not called for Lancaster, but a tornado emergency was called for the nearby cities of Dallas, Greenville, and Arlington. No deaths were reported from either the Lancaster tornado or any other tornado that day.

On June 23, 2019, Lancaster was one of 10 U.S. communities selected to receive the All-America City Award from the National Civic League. The city was recognized for its civic engagement and communications to address community health concerns through: the development of new and improvement of existing parks; a community health challenge with runs, walks and health fairs; and a workplace wellness program.

== Geography ==
Lancaster is located in southern Dallas County and is part of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, the largest metropolitan area in Texas. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and is covered by water. On November 14, 2011, a tract of land covering within Lancaster&#x27;s extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) was annexed to the city.

Lancaster is situated within the Blackland Prairie region of Texas, which is characterized by level to gently rolling topography. Ten Mile Creek and its tributaries are major drainage features in and around the city. Because the area was used for farming and other agricultural businesses, much of the natural vegetation has been cleared. Areas near creeks have retained some of their original tree cover, which includes pecan trees, cedar elms, and several species of oaks.

=== Climate ===
Lancaster is located within the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;), which is characterized by hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters. Typically, July is the warmest month and January is the coolest month. The maximum average precipitation occurs in May.

== Demographics ==


As of the 2020 United States census, there were 41,275 people, 13,646 households, and 9,660 families residing in the city.

== Economy ==
In its early years, Lancaster was an agrarian market center for the surrounding area. The arrival of railroads in the late 19th century transformed the community into a transportation hub. As the city has grown, the economic base has diversified. Today, light industrial manufacturing, distribution, health care, education, residential development, and retail services are all significant components of the local economy.

Lancaster has attracted the attention of logistics-related companies in recent years. The city&#x27;s location in the fast-growing Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex region, land availability, easy access to three major interstate highways, Lancaster Regional Airport, and a planned 200-acre BNSF intermodal freight facility round out the logistic options of road, rail, and air for the transport of goods. Park 20/35 at the northeast corner of Houston School Road and Cedardale Road is the largest logistics business park in Lancaster. It was developed in 2006 and now houses manufacturing and warehouse facilities for Quaker Oats/PepsiCo, Mars Petcare and BMW among others.

According to Lancaster&#x27;s 2022 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

== Government ==
=== Local government ===
The City of Lancaster is a home-rule city with a council–manager government. Under this type of local government, the day-to-day management of the city is directed by a city manager, who is appointed by the city council and serves as chief administrative officer for the city. Opal Mauldin Robertson is the current city manager of Lancaster.

The seven-member city council consists of the mayor, who represents the city as a whole and is elected at-large, and six members elected in single-member districts. The current electoral system was implemented in 1994. The mayor and city council members serve staggered three-year terms. Clyde C. Hairston is the current mayor of Lancaster.

Lancaster is a voluntary member of the North Central Texas Council of Governments, the purpose of which is to co-ordinate individual and collective local governments and facilitate regional solutions, eliminate unnecessary duplication, and enable joint decisions.

=== State and national representation ===
Lancaster is located in Texas&#x27; 30th congressional district of the U.S. House of Representatives and is represented by Democrat Jasmine Crockett. In the Texas Legislature, Lancaster is in District 23 of the Texas Senate, represented by Democrat Royce West. In the Texas House of Representatives, the city is part of District 109, which is represented by Democrat Carl Sherman, Sr.

== Education ==
=== Primary and secondary schools ===

Lancaster is served mainly by the Lancaster Independent School District (LISD). The school district consists of 11 campuses: seven elementary schools, one sixth grade center, one middle school, one high school, and an alternative school. Approximately 6,800 students were enrolled in LISD as of Fall 2013.

The Dallas Independent School District (DISD) serves a small portion of the city that includes the subdivisions of Cedardale Highlands, Taylor Brothers, and Lancaster Gardens. Students living in this area are zoned to Wilmer-Hutchins Elementary School, Kennedy-Curry Middle School, and Wilmer-Hutchins High School. The area had been part of the Wilmer-Hutchins Independent School District (WHISD) until the district was ordered closed prior to the start of the 2005–2006 school year. Dallas ISD agreed to absorb WHISD after Lancaster, which was given the first option to take over the district, declined.

Two public charter schools are in the city. Life School Lancaster opened in 2007 and serves students from kindergarten through sixth grade. In January 2012, the Accelerated Intermediate Academy (AIA) opened an elementary campus in Lancaster on East Belt Line Road.

Lancaster residents can obtain a library card free of charge, which entitles the bearer to borrow materials and use the public-access internet computers. Nonresidents may purchase a library card for a nominal, annual fee.

Just north of the library is a paved contemplative garden funded by the nonprofit Friends of the Lancaster Veterans Memorial Library organization.

The responsibilities of Lancaster&#x27;s Parks and Recreation Department include park maintenance, recreation programs, and management of recreational facilities.

=== Parks ===
The system of public parks in Lancaster covers more than 600 acres. The 170-acre Lancaster Community Park is the most-used park in the city. It features a 6-acre pond known as Contemplation Lake with a fishing pier, lighted football and soccer fields, hiking/biking trails, playground, amphitheater, and the Royce Clayton Baseball Field, which has a covered grandstand that can seat 500 spectators. The Recreation Center, Senior Life Center, Library, and Public Safety Building are located in the park.

Lancaster City Park is another highly used park in the city with four baseball/softball fields, two playgrounds, two tennis courts, a basketball court, walking trail, and an off-leash area for dogs. The park also has two concession stands and two large pavilions, each with 15 tables.

There are smaller neighborhood parks located throughout the city with playgrounds and other amenities. They are J.A. Dewberry Park, Jaycee Park, Kids Square Park, Meadowcreek Park, Rocky Crest Park, Stanford Park, and Verona Park. Heritage Park, which contains an iconic gazebo, is located north of the historic town square in downtown Lancaster. The newest addition to the park system is the 2.4 mile Pleasant Run Hike and Bike Trail, which opened in the spring of 2010 and is routed through neighborhoods in central Lancaster.

Two nature preserves have been established in Lancaster, Bear Creek Nature Park and the Ten Mile Creek Preserve. The 189-acre Bear Creek Nature Park was created on land purchased with a $500,000 matching grant from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. Features of the park site include equestrian and walking trails with interpretive signage, a fishing pond, climbing rock, butterfly garden, and a large pavilion for picnics. Additionally, there is an outdoor classroom and educational programs available for children. The Ten Mile Creek Preserve sits on land donated to the city by Dallas County. It remains largely undeveloped to protect the natural meadows and wooded areas. A two-mile unpaved trail runs through the preserve.

<doc id="135754" wikidata="Q981781" url="?curid=135754" title="Sunnyvale, Texas">
<text>Sunnyvale is a town in Dallas County, Texas, United States. It is the easternmost city completely within Dallas County. The population was 7,893 in 2020. The town had a median household income in 2020 of $137,656.

==History==

The area now occupied by Sunnyvale was inhabited by various Native American tribes in the years before the European conquest of the Americas. It came under the rule of Spain in the 18th century, very close to the boundary of Spanish and French territory (although this boundary was carried upward a bit in 1819; see Adams-Onís Treaty). During this time, the area was relatively underdeveloped. However, some settlers migrated to Texas and would eventually settle in Sunnyvale.

In 1821, the area became a possession of Mexico when Mexico received its independence from Spain. After the Texas Revolution, the area once again changed hands, under the Republic of Texas. This is when the town started to develop. During this time, settlers migrated to present-day Sunnyvale, naming the hamlet they founded Long Creek. In 1845 Texas became a U.S. state.

As more people arrived, eventually three new hamlets sprang up in the area: New Hope, Tripp, and Hatterville. New Hope was the most prosperous of these. It had many shops and stores, a fair called Gala Days, and a newspaper, the New Hope News. It was neighboring Mesquite&#x27;s biggest rival. This all ended in 1921, when a storm blew the town away. Many buildings were damaged and the prosperous days were over. From this year on to the 1950s, the four towns had no new developments, remaining stagnant.

In the year 1953, the hamlets of Hatterville, New Hope, Long Creek, and Tripp merged under the name Sunnyvale. The name was chosen in a contest from a local school. Since, there are many reminders of Sunnyvale&#x27;s rich history, like the old New Hope School; the Tripp First Baptist Church, built in 1882; and many antique houses. The Long Creek Cemetery in southern Sunnyvale is over 150 years old, and the first recorded burial there is that of Leona Crownover Caldwell, dated October 2, 1855. The city incorporation in 1953 allowed only single-family houses on .

On December 26, 2015, the town was struck by an EF-4 tornado causing extensive damage to the Plantation RV park, the tornado then grew and moved northeast into Garland and Rowlett killing 12 people and injuring many.

On June 5, 2023, Sunnyvale made national headlines after story broke of a mass shooting incident. According to Sunnyvale Police, a family of five were shot. A woman was killed and four children were injured.

==Geography==

Sunnyvale is located at (32.803646, –96.569654). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

Sunnyvale had a population of 969 in 1960, only to increase to 5,130 at the 2010 census. In 2020, its population increased by 53.9% to 7,893 residents.

Once an overwhelmingly non-Hispanic white community, the 2020 U.S. census determined 49.37% of the population were non-Hispanic white; this reflected nationwide and statewide demographic trends of diversification prominent in the beginning of the 21st century. Asian Americans increased to 25.49% of the population, and Hispanic or Latinos of any race were 10.78%; Black and African Americans grew to 10.15% of the local population, followed by multiracial Americans at 3.14%. American Indians and Alaska Natives were 0.34% of the population; some other race 0.61%; and Pacific Islanders made up 0.11%.

==Government and infrastructure==
The town council includes six members and the mayor. As of September 2020, Saji George is the mayor of Sunnyvale. As of the same year the council members are Ryan Finch, Kevin Clark, Manu Danny, Mark Eldridge, Larry Allen, and Jonathan Freeman.

In 2000 a U.S. district court ruled that Sunnyvale had enacted planning and zoning practices that were in place to exclude the development of apartments and small single family lots. Sunnyvale and the Inclusive Communities Project (ICP) entered into an agreement in which Sunnyvale was given three years to identify 70 housing units favorable for purchase or rent by low income individuals and families. Since 2008, three developers have considered low income developments in Sunnyvale, but no applications have been filed with the Town. ICP filed a lawsuit against Sunnyvale in 2009, seeking the development of low income units at a site in Sunnyvale. Sunnyvale&#x27;s government responded, saying that it had taken appropriate steps to approve the creation of low income housing.

&quot;The Town of Sunnyvale received an order from Honorable Judge Reed O&#x27;Connor regarding the Dews vs Town of Sunnyvale case, finding the Town in contempt of court for its failure to implement the Settlement Stipulation in the case by April 15, 2008. The Town has reviewed, and understands Judge O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s order, yet is clearly disappointed in the ruling, because the Town believes that it did all that was possible to comply with the settlement under the circumstances. But Judge Reed O&#x27;Connor found the Town guilty of contempt of court and the town has to July 15, 2011, to comply and make available 70 low income units that qualifies for section 8 vouchers.

In October 2019, the Sunnyvale Police Department was established and began the start-up phase of standing up a new Police Department. The Town was contracted with the Dallas County Sheriff&#x27;s Office for many years, and they continued to provide law enforcement services to the Town of Sunnyvale through October 2020, when Sunnyvale Police Department took over operations.

Sunnyvale is in Texas State House District 112, represented by Republican Angie Chen Button. Sunnyvale is in Texas Senate District 2, represented by Republican Senator Bob Hall.

==Education==
Sunnyvale Independent School District takes students in Sunnyvale who are in grades pre-kindergarten through 12. Sunnyvale High School&#x27;s facility opened in 2009.

Prior to fall 2007, Sunnyvale did not operate a high school; for high school Sunnyvale&#x27;s students were zoned to the Mesquite Independent School District (MISD), attending North Mesquite High School.

Sunnyvale has a public library, located on Tower Place in the northwestern portion of the city.

All of Dallas County (Sunnyvale included) is in the service area of Dallas College (formerly Dallas County Community College).

==Parks and recreation==
Sunnyvale is along Lake Ray Hubbard, which has recreational activities for Sunnyvale residents.

There are also four parks in the city: Jobson Park, Town Center Park, Samuell Farm North, and Robert Vineyard Park.

<text>University Park is a city in Dallas County, Texas, United States, in suburban Dallas. The population was 25,278 at the 2020 census. The city is home to Southern Methodist University.

University Park is bordered on the north, east and west by Dallas and on the south by the town of Highland Park. University Park and Highland Park together comprise the Park Cities, an enclave of Dallas. University Park is one of the most affluent places in Texas based on per capita income; it is ranked #12. In 2018, data from the American Community Survey revealed that University Park was the second wealthiest city in the United States, with a median household income of $198,438 and a poverty rate of 4.2%.

Addresses in University Park may use either &quot;Dallas, Texas&quot; or &quot;University Park, Texas&quot; as the city designation, although the United States Postal Service prefers the use of the &quot;Dallas, Texas&quot; designation for the sake of simplicity. The same is true for mail sent to Highland Park.

==History==
University Park began as a cluster of homes surrounding the fledgling Southern Methodist University, which was founded in the then-rural Dallas County in 1915. The university supplied these homes with utility service until 1924, when the growing population could no longer be supported by the school&#x27;s utilities. In response, the area&#x27;s homeowners first sought annexation into the town of Highland Park, but were refused due to the high cost that would have been required to provide the necessary utility and safety services. Shortly thereafter, Dallas also refused a request for annexation on similar grounds.

Community leaders organized to incorporate as a separate individual city. According to state law, incorporation required that area residents hold an election on the issue before the new city could be officially formed and recognized. On April 24, 1924, voters approved the measure by a 5:1 margin. Operating under the commission form of government, the city began the work of shaping the new government and addressing the pressing need to establish basic municipal services. To provide for the financial needs of the city, another election was held soon thereafter to authorize the issuance of municipal bonds. Passing by a near unanimous margin, the $150,000 bond issue funded the installation of a new water supply system, street paving, and the construction of a new city hall and fire station. When first incorporated, the city encompassed , 380 homes, and 1200 residents.

As a result of efforts to build and improve the city, University Park grew to a population of over 20,000 residents by 1945 and had become one of the most prestigious locations in the area. In fact, the community&#x27;s attractiveness and tax value had risen to such an extent that the city of Dallas now wanted to annex University Park into its boundaries. At the time of the election, even the Board of Commissioners favored the annexation. In the largest voter turnout to that date and still one of the largest in city history, the annexation was denied by a 53% to 47% margin.

In 1946 an election to adopt a Home Rule Charter was held, but the measure failed and the city continued to operate as a General Law city. In 1989, voters approved a Home Rule Charter which officially adopted a council-manager form of government and expanded the three member board of Commissioners into a five-member city council.

Since the 1940s, the population and area of University Park has stabilized at 24,000 residents and 2,350 acres (4.7 square miles). The city is now surrounded by Dallas on three sides and the town of Highland Park to the south.

Originally University Park was a middle class community. Highland Park residents spearheaded the creation of the Highland Park Independent School District and asked the neighbors to the north to become a part of the district; taxes were lower since the district included University Park&#x27;s population. HPISD had no racial diversity in the 1950s and 1960s, when other Dallas-area school districts dealt with racial integration and white flight. The federal court orders to integrate had no effect in HPISD since it did not receive federal money. As a result, values of HPISD-zoned properties in University Park rose dramatically and the demographic makeup became wealthier, with smaller houses being replaced by larger ones circa the 1970s.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and 0.27% is water.

==Demographics==


As of the 2020 United States census, there were 25,278 people, 7,593 households, and 6,358 families residing in the city.

==Politics==

The city of University Park has consistently supported Republican presidential candidates in recent years. The seven most recent campaigns from 1996 to 2020 each earned over 60% of the city&#x27;s vote, with the best showing being the 81.44% of the vote won by Texas native George W. Bush in 2000. However, the city&#x27;s vote total is getting progressively more competitive, with Donald Trump receiving less than 70% of the vote in all three of his runs.
==Education==

===Primary and secondary schools===
University Park is served by the Highland Park Independent School District (HPISD). As such, it is served by the HPISD&#x27;s McCulloch Intermediate School and Highland Park Middle School (which share a campus located partially in Highland Park and partially in University Park), and Highland Park High School located in University Park. There are two HPISD elementary schools located in University Park (Hyer and University Park), two HPISD elementary schools located in neighboring Highland Park (Armstrong and Bradfield) and one elementary school located in the city of Dallas (Michael M. Boone Elementary). All five elementary schools serve sections of the UP city limits.

A small portion of University Park west of North Central Expressway is in the Dallas Independent School District. It is however not zoned for residential purposes.

===Colleges, universities, and institutions===
Southern Methodist University is located in the city of University Park. The Meadows Museum, which houses the largest collection of Spanish art in the United States, can be found on the campus. The George W. Bush Presidential Center, the presidential library for George W. Bush, can also be found on the campus, and was opened in 2013.

All of Dallas County (University Park included) is in the service area of Dallas College (formerly Dallas County Community College).

===Public libraries===
The new University Park Public Library location is the second floor of Preston Center Plaza. The old location was the first floor of a Chase Bank building at the southern end of Snider Plaza, at the intersection of Daniel and Hillcrest. The owner of the former building, Albert Huddleston, charged the city $1 per year to use the building space, as of 2009.

The library opened on June 7, 2001, as the University Park Book Bank in Snider Plaza. Before this, the town had no library. Residents could pay to use the Highland Park Public Library or the Dallas Public Library. On April 1, 2002, the book bank became a municipal library.

==Parks and recreation==

The City of University Park operates several parks. They include Burleson Park, Caruth Park, Coffee Park, Curtis Park, Elena&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Park, Germany Park, Goar Park, Linear Park, Smith Park, and Williams Park.

Burleson Park was named after James B. Burleson, who served as the Mayor Pro-tem and the city commissioner. University Park mayor H. E. Yarbrough dedicated the park on September 5, 1947. Elena Children&#x27;s Park was named after Mary Elena Franklin, a girl who died at the age of three in an automobile accident on August 2, 1997. Over 500 corporations, families, and foundations contributed to the park.

The Holmes Aquatic Center, within Curtis Park, has a pool, and diving boards, a water slide, and an accessibility ramp. The park also has a pool for younger children and a sprayground. University Park residents and residents of the Highland Park Independent School District are permitted to use the park. The city operates six tennis courts available only to University Park residents. Parks with tennis courts include Burleson, Caruth, Curtis, Germany, Smith, and Williams.

The Moody Family YMCA is in University Park. It was formerly known as the Park Cities-North Dallas Branch YMCA. Circa 2014 its previous building was to be demolished, and the YMCA leased in Preston Center for the period until its new building would open. It received its current name after the Moody Foundation donated $8 million in 2013 with the new name on the new building.

<doc id="135756" wikidata="Q981715" url="?curid=135756" title="Wilmer, Texas">
<text>Wilmer is a city in Dallas County, Texas, United States. The population was 3,682 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Wilmer is located at (32.590743, –96.682619). It is situated along Interstate 45 in southeastern Dallas County, approximately south of downtown Dallas.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.82%, is water.

==History==
The area was initially settled by Andrew K. Gray before 1850. The settlement was originally known as Prairie Valley when the Houston and Texas Central Railroad arrived in 1872. In 1884, the post office in Prairie Valley was renamed Wilmer, after A.J. Wilmer, a conductor on the Houston and Texas Central line. The population was estimated at 100 in 1890, with several stores and businesses operation in the community. That figure had risen to over 200 by the start of World War I. A fire destroyed most of Wilmer&#x27;s business district on July 4, 1929. The community&#x27;s shallow wells were unable to pump the adequate amount of water needed to extinguish the blaze.

Wilmer incorporated in 1945, and its first mayor, J.H. May, was elected on a platform of installing a water system. At the time of incorporation, Wilmer had 136 homes and a population of approximately 450. In 1949, a volunteer fire department was established and a fire truck was purchased. Around the same time, Wilmer and the neighboring city of Hutchins consolidated their schools. By 1960, Wilmer was home to 1,785 residents. Throughout the latter half of the twentieth century, Wilmer continued to grow, but at a much slower rate than other communities in Dallas County. With 3,393 residents as of the 2000 census, Wilmer is currently one of the smallest incorporated cities in Dallas County.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 4,974 people, 1,576 households, and 1,095 families residing in the city.

==Economy==

Union Pacific&#x27;s Dallas Intermodal Terminal is located partly in the city of Wilmer and partly in the city of Hutchins. The shipping facility, built by AUI Contractors, Prime Rail Interests and Halff Associates, was a 70 million U.S. dollar project. After Union Pacific (UP) chose Wilmer for its global intermodal facility, the City attracted Fortune 500 companies like Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble, Whirlpool, Ace Hardware and Medline. Wilmer offers easy access to all regional Interstates (I-45, I-20, I-30), U.S. Highways, and both international and general aviation airports (Lancaster, DFW International, Love Field).

Wilmer offers a low tax rate along with incentives that include City Tax Abatements, Economic Development Sales Tax Funds, City of Wilmer Sales Tax – 380 agreements, Triple Freeport Exemptions, State of Texas Programs, Dallas County Tax Abatements, Federal Programs including New Market Tax Credits, and a Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ).

==Education==
Wilmer is served by the Dallas Independent School District. The area is within the Board of Trustees District 5; as of 2008 Lew Blackburn represents the district. As of fall 2011 the area is zoned to Eddie Bernice Johnson Elementary School, Kennedy-Curry Middle School, and Wilmer-Hutchins High School.

In 2015 the Wilmer Early Childhood Center, located on the site of the former Wilmer Elementary School, opened.

Dallas County residents are zoned to Dallas College (formerly Dallas County Community College or DCCCD).

===School histories===

Wilmer-Hutchins Independent School District used to serve Wilmer. Until the end of the school district, Wilmer Elementary School was located in Wilmer. In addition, Kennedy-Curry Middle School and Wilmer-Hutchins High School in Dallas, then under WHISD control, served Wilmer. WHISD was closed after spring 2005 with official termination in June 2006. After the closure of WHISD property values in the district increased.

From 2005 to 2009 Wilmer was served by various DISD schools. From 2005 to 2006 to 2008–2009 W. W. Bushman, B. F. Darrell, J. N. Ervin, and Whitney M. Young elementary schools served sections of Wilmer. From 2009–2010 to 2010–2011 only Bushman, Ervin, and Young served sections of Wilmer.

In the 2005–2006 and the 2006–2007 school years Sarah Zumwalt Middle School served as Wilmer&#x27;s middle school. From 2006–2007 to 2010–2011 Zumwalt (Darrell, Young, and Ervin zones) and Maynard H. Jackson Middle School (Bushman zone) served portions of Wilmer.

From 2005–2006 to 2010–2011 A. Maceo Smith High School served as Wilmer&#x27;s high school.

Dallas ISD was considering opening a new Wilmer-Hutchins Elementary School building, restoring the Wilmer-Hutchins High School building, and demolishing the Kennedy-Curry Middle School building as part of its 2008 bond campaign. The district was scheduled to Wilmer Hutchins Elementary School in an area within the City of Dallas in 2011. In November 2010 DISD announced that three schools (Wilmer Hutchins ES, Kennedy-Curry Middle School, and Wilmer-Hutchins HS) would open/re-open in the Wilmer-Hutchins area in 2011.

The charter school group Honors Academy previously operated Wilmer Academy, a K–8 school, in Wilmer.

A branch of Howard College, a community college in Big Spring, is located in Lamesa.

==Culture==

During the last weekend of April, Lamesa hosts the annual Chicken Fried Steak Festival. Lamesa has been called &quot;the birthplace of the chicken-fried steak&quot;, but the reporter who made the designation later confessed that the claim is fictional. Nevertheless, in 2011, Governor Rick Perry declared Lamesa the home of the chicken-fried steak. In the 2013 competition, Mayor Dave Nix teamed with city councilman Greg Hughes as contestants. The community event attracted 65 sponsors and 104 booths.

La Entrada al Pacifico is an international trade corridor that begins in Topolobampo, Mexico, runs through Midland-Odessa and ends in Lamesa (according to the legal definition).

Lamesa&#x27;s Sky-Vue Drive-In Theater, established in 1948, became a well-known regional fixture. It has been closed since a kitchen fire destroyed the snack bar on November 27, 2015. Known for its &quot;Chihuahua sandwich&quot;, conceived by owners R. A. &quot;Skeet&quot; Noret and his wife, Sarah, the Sky-Vue was one of only 14 remaining drive-in theaters in Texas. Others are in Lubbock and Clarendon. Before he became famous, musician Buddy Holly performed on the roof of the Sky Vue&#x27;s projector building. The theater was also used as cover art and named in the title of country music album &quot;Down at the Sky-Vue Drive-In&quot; by country music artist Don Walser. Lamesa also has an indoor movie theater, Movieland, which has two screens.

&quot;The Wall&quot; on S 2nd Street is a brick wall on which graduating seniors of Lamesa High School paint their names. Each year, the new graduating class adds their own graffiti on top of the last.

The CBS television series &quot;Dallas&quot; had one of its more profitable oil wells, Ewing 23, in Lamesa. In one of the more dramatic scenes of the series, in season four, J. R. Ewing flies in his Learjet to the Lamesa airport. Shortly thereafter, gunfire erupts and Dawson County sheriff&#x27;s deputies shoot a man who blew up the oilfield after a failed effort to blackmail Ewing.

===Dal Paso Museum===
The Dal Paso Museum, a collection of local artifacts housed in a former hotel, is located in downtown Lamesa. The name is derived from the fact that Lamesa is located on the table land of the Staked Plains. On display are home furnishings, pioneer tools, ranch and farm equipment, and exhibits by local artists. The museum, at 306 South First Street, has limited afternoon hours to the public.

==Media==
The city is served by a biweekly newspaper, &quot;The Lamesa Press Reporter.&quot; Local radio station KPET (AM 690) broadcasts local news, call-in shows, and country music, in addition to sporting events from the hometown Golden Tornadoes, the Red Raiders, and the Texas Rangers. Other radio stations include KBKN (FM) and KVLM (FM). The cable TV system is operated by Northland Cable Television. Other signals are received from stations in Lubbock, Midland-Odessa, and other area towns. Television signals are provided by ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, Fox, Telemundo and CW stations in Lubbock and the Univision station in the Permian Basin (Midland-Odessa).

<text>Los Ybanez is a city in Dawson County, Texas, United States. The population was 28 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Los Ybanez was organized in the late 1970s (formally incorporated in 1983) as one of several Texas municipalities that were organized in order to legalize local sale of alcoholic spirits. These were usually small areas of land, adjacent to larger towns or cities. Others included Impact near Abilene, TX and Orbit near Monahans, TX.

Texas law provides that all its 254 counties are essentially &quot;dry&quot;; that is, liquor sales are not allowed. Local governments can opt for these sales through &quot;local option&quot; elections. The western half of Texas is generally and historically dry, though as the metro areas grew, most allow liquor in clubs, some on sale in stores.

Los Ybanez was founded by members of the family of Israel G. and Mary Ybanez. Ybanez purchased a tract of land outside all towns from the state of Texas (which had obtained title from the federal government after World War II.) The land had been used for soldiers&#x27; barracks during military training exercises at an adjoining glider base. Family members were moved to the land to occupy the houses and establish residency. Later they incorporated as a town, got a US Post Office, and legalized liquor sales. The store operates to this day as a drive through only operation, accepting only cash.

The Ybanez family also founded a local radio station, KYMI (later KJJT) as a vehicle for advertising for the liquor store business. KYMI began on 107.9 MHz, but moved to 98.5 in 1996 when a station in Odessa upgraded facilities. KYMI received money for a new transmitter and antenna in return for agreeing to change channels.

<text>Hereford ( ) is a city in and county seat of Deaf Smith County, Texas, United States. It is 48 miles southwest of Amarillo. Its population was 14,972 at the 2020 census. It is the only incorporated locality named &quot;Hereford&quot; in the United States.

The area is known for its semiarid climate, with heavy farming and ranching throughout the area sustained by irrigation from the Ogallala Aquifer and the saltier Santa Rosa Aquifer beneath it. 

Hereford&#x27;s local water supply contains an unusually high level of naturally occurring fluoride. Because fluoride is used to protect against tooth decay, Hereford earned the title &quot;The Town Without a Toothache&quot;.

It is also known as the &quot;Beef Capital of the World&quot; because of the large number of cattle feedlots in the area. The city is named for the Hereford breed. The local economy is affected significantly by growth in the dairy and ethanol industries.

Hereford is also home to the headquarters of the Deaf Smith Electric Cooperative, which serves Deaf Smith, Castro, Parmer, and Oldham Counties.

==History==

Hereford was founded as &quot;Blue Water&quot; in 1899 after the Pecos and Northern Texas Railway connected Amarillo to Farwell. After a town already named Blue Water was discovered, residents renamed the town &quot;Hereford&quot; in honor of the cattle of the local ranchers and the city, Hereford, in the United Kingdom.

During World War II, a prisoner-of-war camp existed there for Italian prisoners of war. It was dismantled in 1947.

In 1975, popular high school teacher Wayne Woodward was fired for his efforts to establish a local branch of the American Civil Liberties Union. Mr. Woodward won a subsequent legal suit, that gained national attention, against the Hereford Independent School District. The events were documented in the 2022 book &quot;You Will Never Be One of Us&quot; by Timothy P. Bowman.

A rich Western heritage includes the Las Escarbadas ranch house of the XIT Ranch, once located southwest of Hereford. The restored historic structure can now be seen at the National Ranching Heritage Center at Texas Tech University in Lubbock. The Deaf Smith County Historical Museum at 400 Sampson Street in Hereford offers indoor and outdoor exhibits on the settlement of West Texas.

Hereford was once known as the &quot;Windmill City&quot; due to its many windmills supplying fresh water from the Ogallala Aquifer.

<text>Cooper is a city in and the county seat of Delta County, in the U.S. state of Texas. Located between the north and south forks of the Sulphur River, Cooper is the largest settlement in Delta County. At the 2020 United States census, the city had a population of 1,911.

First inhabited by native people, Cooper was founded around 1870, at the same time that Delta County was established. Cooper grew rapidly and quickly became the center of local events. The city&#x27;s economy relied primarily on agriculture and the shipping of local goods. In the mid-1890s, a railroad line was built through the city, assisting in Cooper&#x27;s growth. The city continued to grow through the 1910s, and into the early 1920s. In 1926, however, the region&#x27;s cotton crop failed, devastating the local economy. Many businesses were forced to close, including the railroad, and the city&#x27;s population plummeted. Although Cooper began to recover during the mid-1930s, many people who left did not return, and the city never fully recovered. The local economy continued to rely on the growing of cotton as the main economy into the 1960s, until it began to shift to wheat growing in the early 1970s. The population of Cooper has been on a slow decline since the 1970s.

Cooper has no sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The city&#x27;s economy still relies largely on agriculture. Cooper is located on the eastern edge of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex (DFW metroplex), a large, 12-county metropolitan area, one of the most populated in the country.

==History==
===Before establishment===
The first inhabitants of the area that is now the site of Cooper were the Caddo Indians, who settled large portions of eastern Texas as early as 800 CE. The Caddo were highly advanced, living in large wooden structures, and were skilled farmers. The first European to visit the area was French explorer François Hervey, who discovered the area around 1750. However, a few decades later, some of the Indians caught European diseases and along with attacks from neighboring Indian tribes, forced the Caddo out of the area around Cooper. Around 1820, Delaware, Quapaw, and Seminole tribes settled in the area. In 1836, the Republic of Texas officially recognized the region around Cooper as part of Red River County. In 1840, Lamar County was formed, absorbing the Cooper area. However, just six years later, the region was designated as part of the newly formed Hopkins County.

After the Civil War, the region around the site of Cooper began to grow and develop. People in nearby Ben Franklin, Texas, grew tired of the poor road conditions that connected the region. In 1868, people in the area petitioned the state government to create a new county located between the north and south forks of the Sulphur River. On July 29, 1870, after two years of debating, the state of Texas granted the request for the new county. Shortly afterwards, the first settlements were built in Cooper and the town was established. The community was named after Leroy Cooper, the chairman of the Texas House Committee on Counties and Boundaries, who helped establish the new county. Cooper was selected as the seat for the county, which was named Delta County due to its triangular shape.

===Since establishment===
Cooper grew rapidly after being established, with a post office built in the community in 1871. Cooper was incorporated into a town in 1881 and held its first government elections. That same year, Cooper constructed the county courthouse. The town became the main market center for Delta County, and by 1885, Cooper had a population around 300. The Texas Midland Railroad, which ran through Cooper, was chartered in 1892. The railroad helped promote the rapid growth of the town. By 1896, Cooper&#x27;s population had passed 1,000 people, and contained two churches, a school, and 21 businesses, including a bank and a hotel. The town also had two weekly newspapers. Cooper continued to grow into the early 1900s, especially in the area of agriculture. From the early 1890s to around 1910, farms boomed both in number and in value, with the number of cash crops nearly tripling. The region produced over 70,000 chickens and almost 7,000 pigs yearly.

Cooper continued to grow into the 1920s. The bank had been rebuilt in 1909, and the region&#x27;s crops continued to prosper. Cooper reported its largest population, 2,563, in 1925. Delta County was hit by the Great Depression early, though. In late 1926, the community&#x27;s cotton crop failed, forcing many residents to withdraw their savings. The bank was forced to close in 1927, and by the time it reopened a few months later, the region&#x27;s economy had plummeted. Several families moved away from Cooper during the early 1930s, and in 1933, the bank was forced to close again. The Midland Texas Railroad failed, hurting Cooper&#x27;s economy further. The New Deal program offered government-financed construction projects in Cooper, and in 1940, the Works Progress Administration demolished the former courthouse in Cooper and replaced it with a new one at a cost of $110,450 (equivalent to $ respectively in 2022). However, even with the stability of the economy, Cooper&#x27;s population remained low until the 1950s, when it returned to about 2,350 people. The population declined again in the 1980s, and has continued to slowly decline. Cooper had roughly 60 businesses in the 1970s and 1980s, and in 1986, work on Cooper Lake had begun. Filling of the lake began in September 1991, and by the next year, the lake was open for recreation. At that time, Cooper reported having 70 businesses, and a population around 2,200. By 2000, the population had dropped by about 50 people and an estimate for 2016 is 1,957 inhabitants.

In 1880, seven churches, which were predominantly Methodist, had been established in Delta County. In 1889, seven Baptist churches that had been established in the region held a meeting as the Delta County Baptist Association. During the early 1980s, 17 churches were in Delta County, two of which were located in Cooper. In 1931, 13 Baptist churches were located in and around Cooper.

Six of the churches are of Baptist denomination and three are Methodist.

==Economy==

Cooper&#x27;s economy relied heavily on agriculture from its founding until the 1950s, especially on the growing of cash crops. In 1880, cotton, corn, sorghum and other crops were grown on over of farmland. The county also produced large quantities of livestock, with almost 3,000 cattle and 10,000 hogs grazing on land near Cooper. The logging industry began to grow in the region, and several mills were constructed, producing furniture and lumber. In 1886, the Santa Fe Railway built a line through the county, and the shipping of crops and lumber became a major business in Cooper. During the early 1890s, the livestock industry in Delta County struggled, with the number of hogs being raised dropping to half of what it had been the previous decade. However, the agricultural business boomed, with the number of farms in the area around Cooper increasing to 1,188, and the value of the farms doubled to $1,400 (equivalent to $, respectively in 2022) each. The production of cotton tripled and the poultry industry began to boom. Within the city limits, Cooper had a hotel, a shoemaker, a grocery store, a wagon maker, feed stores, general stores, drug stores and several cotton and oat gins. Delta County contained 18 manufacturing establishments, but they only employed 33 people. The average income for someone working in the region was $208 (equivalent to $ respectively in 2022).

At the start of the 20th century, the cotton industry was booming. The crop made up 69% of the agricultural business in the region. Livestock production was booming, as was poultry production, especially chicken. In addition, the shipping of agricultural goods and livestock was the other main business in Cooper. The First National Bank was rebuilt in 1909 and became an important factor in Cooper&#x27;s economy. In the 1910s, potatoes become an important part of the economy due to the sudden drop in the livestock business. In 1926, the cotton crop failed and Cooper&#x27;s economy plummeted. Many of Cooper&#x27;s inhabitants became deep in debt as the price of crops plummeted. The lumber businesses had exhausted the regions resources, forcing most of them to go out of business. Many people moved away to find new work. The local economy stabilized in the mid-1930s, and cotton, potato, and corn production began to rise. The growing of oats, however, had ended. In addition, the railroad going through Cooper had failed a few years before, so the shipping industry in Cooper was struggling. Cotton and alfalfa carried Cooper&#x27;s economy through the 1950s and 1960s, until the shift to the growing of wheat in the 1970s. Cooper reported 60 businesses in the 1970s, more than half of which were dairies. During the 1980s and 1990s, Cooper&#x27;s economy shifted to the manufacturing and shipping of local goods, and in 1991, Cooper had 70 businesses.

Currently, Cooper&#x27;s economy has several industries. According to the 2010 census, the industries in the town (by percentage of employed civilian population 16 years and over) were educational, health and social services at 34.6%, manufacturing at 18.7%, arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation and food services with 13.6%, construction at 10.2%, transportation, warehousing and utilities at 5.1%, professional, scientific, management, administrative and waste management services at 4.9%, public administration with 4.3%, retail trade at 3.9%, finance, insurance, real estate and rental and leasing with 2.0%, other services (except public administration) with 1.6% and agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting and mining at 1.0%.

Of the people in the labor force over the age of 16, 679 (49.3% of the population) were in the civilian work force, while 697 (50.7% of the population) were not in the labor force at all. At the time of the census, 70 people (5.1%) were unemployed, with none in the armed forces. Of the 609 employed residents over the age of 16, private-sector wage and salary workers accounted for 475 (78.0%). 109 (17.9%) were classified as federal government workers, with the self-employed making up 4.1% of the population. No one was classified as an unpaid worker.

The median household income for the city of Cooper was $27,531 with 137 persons (19.7%) in that class of income. 125 (18.0%) identified themselves as retired.

==Arts and culture==

Since its founding, Cooper has been the center of attractions for Delta County. The city has several small schools and churches. In 1955, the construction of Cooper Lake was authorized. In 1986, major work on the lake began and it was finished in 1991. The lake is now the most popular tourist attraction in the area. Boating, swimming and fishing are available at Cooper Lake. The main fish stocked in the lake are catfish, largemouth bass and crappie. Along the north shore of the lake is the Doctor&#x27;s Creek Unit of Cooper Lake State Park. The park contains several picnic areas, campgrounds and a large swimming area on Cooper Lake. It also contains several hiking and equestrian trails. On the eastern edge of the lake near the Cooper Lake Dam is the Wildlife Observation Deck, a large birdwatching platform. Along the west and northwest shores of the lake is the Cooper Wildlife Management Area. The park was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and protects four unique habitat types. These are wetland, Blackland Prairie, Upland Post Oak and Bottomland Hardwood. The park contains several hiking trails, as well as birdwatching stations and wildlife viewing areas. The park allows fishing and hunting to visitors if they have a proper license.

Cooper hosts the annual Chiggerfest. The event, held every October, is a social gathering for the region. The two-day event begins with an open-air concert in Historic Cooper Square. Other events include a 5K run/walk and smashing a car. The festival includes numerous street vendors and a children&#x27;s area. Patterson Memorial County Library is also located in Cooper, as well as a municipal park and numerous recreational and community centers, including the historic McKinney Home, the house of Dr. John and May McKinney, which was built in 1912 and later restored by their descendant, the author Susan Albright Hyde.

==Government==
Since its incorporation in 1870, Cooper has served as the seat for Delta County. Because of this, Cooper houses the county courthouse, county offices, sheriff, and county library. Cooper has a mayor–council government. The city council is made up of five members who are elected at large. The council members were (in 2013) mayor pro-tem David Philips, Allen Foster, Amanda L&#x27;Esperance, Diane Stegall, and Elmo Robinson. The city&#x27;s mayor in 2013 was Darren Brady.

The first election in Delta County occurred on October 6, 1870, to establish control in the newly formed county. Cooper held its first election in 1881, establishing an aldermanic government. Around that time, the first county courthouse was built in Cooper. Delta County, in addition to Cooper, voted for the Democratic Party in every presidential election from its incorporation in 1870 until 1968. However, the Populist Party won numerous local and county government positions during the 1890s and the early 1900s. In the 1970s, politics in Delta County changed and most of the county began voting for the Republican Party.

Delta County&#x27;s government consists of a county judge and four county commissioners, representing four county precincts. The Delta County judge (in 2013) was Herbert Brookshire and the four commissioners are B. V. Templeton, David Moody, Wayne Poole, and Mark Brantley. The county sheriff in 2013 was Charla Singleton. In addition, Cooper is served by two Texas judicial districts. Judge Scott McDowell serves as judge of the 62nd Texas Judicial District, a position he has held since 2000. However, McDowell has announced that he will not be seeking another term. Cooper is also part of Texas&#x27; 8th Judicial District, which is served by Judge Robert Newsom. Newsom has served as 8th district judge since his election in 1997, but has also announced that he will not be seeking another term.

==Education==

Delta County has historically been advanced in education. Around the time that Cooper and the county were founded, nine churches were already in the county. By 1880, that number had increased to nearly 30. A combined 998 students attended those schools, which operated 4½ months a year. In 1889, East Texas Normal College was founded in Cooper. The school did very well while located in Cooper, but the college moved to Commerce after the campus was destroyed in a fire in 1894. The school was later renamed East Texas State University, then Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce. In 1896, Cooper reported to have one successful school located within the city proper.

Schools were important during the 1940s, as they became the local activity centers. In the early 1940s, there were 34 common schools and six independent school districts within Delta County. These schools employed 134 people and had a combined total of 4,000 students enrolled. Cooper, along with Pecan Gap and Enloe, offered a four-year high school program. Late in the 1940s, with the help of state taxes on transportation, the schools and districts began to consolidate. In 1966, Cooper had two elementary schools, a junior high school, and a high school.

The Cooper Independent School District (Cooper ISD) currently operates the schools that serve Cooper. Cooper ISD covers the majority of Delta County, except for the community of Lake Creek, which is located within the jurisdiction of Chisum ISD, and the communities of Pecan Gap and Ben Franklin, which are located within Fannindel ISD. There are currently only three schools under the jurisdiction of Cooper ISD, all three of which are located within Cooper proper. The schools are Cooper Elementary School, Cooper Junior High School, and Cooper High School.

==Media==
The first newspaper published in Cooper was the &quot;Delta Courier&quot; in 1873. The newspaper, published by Bob Michiel, ran weekly until the mid-1890s. Around the time the publishing of the &quot;Delta Courier&quot; ended, the &quot;People&#x27;s Cause&quot; newspaper began running weekly. This eventually stopped running. &quot;The Cooper Review&quot; began weekly in 1982 and, run by Jim and Sally Butler, is still published.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Texas State Highway 154 (TX 154) intersects the city, passing through the central portion of Cooper. The highway begins at its terminus in the western portion of Cooper. The roadway travels eastward through central Cooper, before bending southeast and exiting the city. TX 154 travels within the Cooper proper for approximately . TX 154 was first constructed through Cooper on September 26, 1935. State Highway 24 bypasses Cooper as a four-lane divided highway. Only of the highway pass through Cooper, traveling through the western edge of the city limits. TX 24 was originally designated through Cooper on September 26, 1939. However, TX 24 was rerouted around Cooper and, on January 14, 1991, the long portion of highway was redesignated as Texas State Highway 24 Business.

Farm to Market Road 64 (FM 64) enters the western portion of Cooper, traveling for a short distance before terminating at TX 154. The highway, which was constructed on June 23, 1942, spends approximately within the city. FM 1528, known locally as 1st Street, travels through the center of Cooper. Beginning at an intersection with TX 154, the highway travels southward through the city for about , before exiting and turning westward. The road was constructed on September 28, 1949. Nearby highways include FM 1880, which travels from the edge of the city to a part of the Cooper Lake Wildlife Management Area, FM 128, which ends at an intersection with TX 24 a short distance north of Cooper, and FM 1529, which northward a short distance east of the city.

In 1886, the Santa Fe Railroad was constructed to the north of Cooper, through Ben Franklin and Pecan Gap. Nearly a decade later, in 1895, the Texas Midland Railroad was constructed through Cooper, helping the city&#x27;s economy to boom. The extant depot was built in 1913 and, the railroad flourished until 1928, when it was sold to the Southern Pacific Corporation due to the region&#x27;s struggling economy. The line was closed in 1934, and was abandoned in 1975. Currently, the only railroad to pass near Cooper is the Blacklands Railroad. Commerce Municipal Airport is currently the closest airfield to Cooper, located approximately away.

<doc id="135761" wikidata="Q178424" url="?curid=135761" title="Argyle, Texas">
<text>Argyle is a city in Denton County, Texas, United States, with a population of 5,503 as of 2022. It is a suburb of Fort Worth.

==History==

The first European settlement, consisting of a few families, occurred in the Argyle area in the 1850s. The place was then known as Pilot Knob or Waintown. The settlement gradually acquired a few amenities in the late 1800s: a school in 1875, a Baptist church in 1876, and a post office in 1878. The community was formally founded and renamed Argyle in 1881, after the Texas and Pacific railroad built a track through the area. Some believe a railroad surveyor named the town after a garden in France. However, others believe the town to be named after the region of Argyll in Scotland. Also around this time was when Sam Bass, an infamous outlaw who stole $60,000 in gold coins from the Union Pacific Railroad, was rumored to have stashed the gold in a cave. Sam Bass died when he was 27, and it was rumored he never lived to retrieve the gold.

Growth was very slow during the nineteenth century, and by 1890 Argyle only had a population of 148. The town did boast several agriculture-related industries, such as grist mills, general stores, and a cotton gin. In 1885 Argyle built a two-story brick school, and population grew until it reached 238 in 1930. A bank was also established in 1906, a little red brick building with a drugstore in the front. The bank wasn&#x27;t around long before it was robbed in 1912. The robbers made away with $1700 and were never caught. Electricity and telephone service became available in the mid-1930s.

The Great Depression took its toll on the Argyle area, and the population declined to only ninety in 1950. Argyle incorporated as a separate city on September 19, 1960, with M.H. Wilson as the first mayor. Gradually the town grew in population as more people from the Dallas–Fort Worth area discovered its rural charm. By the 1970s a number of retail establishments were located in Argyle, and the population reached 1,575 in 1990, and doubled from that figure to 3,282 at the 2010 census. The high rate of growth is expected to continue as part of the general development of northern areas in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.41%, is water.

==Demographics==


As of the 2020 United States census, there were 4,403 people, 1,582 households, and 1,301 families residing in the city.

==Education and local notes==
The Argyle Independent School District serves the town of Argyle and neighboring areas. The district contains five schools: Hilltop Elementary (grades PreK–5), Argyle West Elementary (grades PreK–5), intermediate (grade 6), middle (grades 7–8), and a high school (grades 9–12). Argyle High School is in classification 4A D1 for UIL. In addition, Liberty Christian School is also located in Argyle, offering grades PK3–12.

Argyle has established a police department and a municipal court, and has a low crime rate. The town sponsored an annual bluegrass music festival, but this ended in 2012.

<text>Aubrey is a city in Denton County, Texas, United States. Its population was 5,006 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Aubrey, the town, was officially founded in 1867, when Civil War veteran Lemuel Noah Edwards (1838–1910) built the second frame house there. Edwards eventually gave each of his 10 children a lot on which to build a home. The Edwards family was instrumental in several civil developments. Dancing was not allowed, but the townspeople often gathered in the Edwards home for singing and listening to music performed on an organ that Edwards had imported.

In 1881, the Texas and Pacific Railway completed a track and station in Aubrey and commenced operations.

In 1885, Edwards offered a lot to each congregation that would build a church within a year. In 1882, Edwards and Louis Caddel Sr. donated land for a one-room schoolhouse in town. Edwards, through one of his daughters—Edna Mae Edwards (1884–1975), who married Hugh Tobin (1884–1929)—was the grandfather of Louise Tobin, a prolific big-band jazz vocalist who attained national acclaim in 1932.

Eventually, Aubrey became known for the peanut farms that surrounded the town. By 2009, horse ranches surrounded Aubrey. Around that time, houses were constructed in Aubrey, replacing the grounds of the old peanut farms.

<text>Bartonville is a town in Denton County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,725 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Bartonville was originally part of the Chinn&#x27;s Chapel settlement, but then it decided to change to a place that was established in 1853 by Elisha Chinn. Chinn&#x27;s Chapel eventually became three small communities, with Bartonville being the lone remaining town. Bartonville was settled in 1878 and was named for T. Bent Barton. In 1886 a local post office was established, and by 1890 Bartonville had 25 residents, a general store, a gristmill, and a cotton gin, all owned by the Barton family. By 1896 Bartonville&#x27;s population was estimated at 100 and the town had three general stores. The post office was discontinued in 1906. Slow growth continued, and by 1930 Bartonville had a population of 300 and a business establishment.

In 1960, with cities such as Irving looking to expand northward, local residents feared annexation and Bartonville incorporated for the first time. The town then included Double Oak and Copper Canyon, as well as present-day Bartonville. Once the fear of annexation subsided a few years later, Bartonville citizens voted for disincorporation.

The present town of Bartonville was incorporated in 1973, and the town has continued to grow as part of the general development of the area north of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Bartonville is adjacent to the master-planned Lantana residential development, which is currently not incorporated.

<text>Copper Canyon is a town in Denton County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,731 in 2020. Copper Canyon is adjacent to the master-planned Lantana residential development.

==History==
The first European settlement in the area that would become Copper Canyon took place in the 1840s. One of the more prominent settler families was that of Elisha and Mary Chinn, who came to Texas from their original home in North Carolina in 1852. They helped establish the first church in the area, a log-cabin chapel which eventually became known as the Chinn&#x27;s Chapel Methodist Church. The church is still active on what is now known as Chinn Chapel Road.

The town gradually grew with cattle ranching as the mainstay of the local economy. The railroad came to the area in 1881, and the first public school was constructed in 1884. The town apparently took its name from &quot;Copperhead Canyon,&quot; a part of the area formerly known for venomous snakes. Population, never large, generally stagnated or declined in the first half of the twentieth century. After World War II the area&#x27;s rural charm slowly began to attract residents from the more crowded parts of the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex.

The town was formally incorporated in 1973. Although still rather sparsely populated, the town has grown as part of the general development of areas north of the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Census Bureau figures tell the story: 465 (1980), 978 (1990), 1,216 (2000), 1,334 (2010). Traditional ranches are still found in the area, but Copper Canyon has become primarily a bedroom community with little commercial development.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and 0.22% is water.

==Demographics==


As of the 2020 United States census, there were 1,731 people, 553 households, and 513 families residing in the town.

==Local notes==
The Town of Copper Canyon is served by the Lewisville and Denton Independent School Districts.

The town contracts with neighboring communities for most municipal services, such as fire protection from Argyle Fire Department, police services from Denton County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, and ambulance service from Lewisville. The town boasts of a low tax rate and a number of horse trails maintained for local riders.

Copper Canyon is also home to the Old Alton Bridge, a registered national historic site. Purportedly haunted, it is locally known as the &quot;Goatman&#x27;s Bridge&quot;.

==Education==
Most of Copper Canyon is in the Lewisville Independent School District, while a portion to the west is in the Denton Independent School District.

Most of Denton ISD Copper Canyon is zoned to Adkins Elementary School, while small parcels are zoned to Blanton Elementary School. All of the Denton ISD part is zoned to Harpool Middle School, and Guyer High School.

==History==
A woman named Geneva Helton and her husband decided to form an incorporated municipality to allow the legal sale of liquor (Denton County does not allow the sale of liquor county-wide, only by local option). The Heltons bought over of land from a family friend. The two then installed a sewer system and established a liquor store. Corral City incorporated in 1973. Afterwards doublewide trailers and recreational vehicles appeared in the city limits. Candace Carlisle of the &quot;Denton Record-Chronicle&quot; said that Corral City &quot;prospered&quot; for a decade, but after the early 1990s retirement of Geneva Helton&#x27;s and the death of her husband, the town, in Carlisle&#x27;s words, &quot;began a slow decline. Soon, all that remained was a graveyard of rotting doublewides.&quot;

According to Carlisle, by 1993, &quot;Corral City looked in every way like a vanquished &#x27;ghost town&#x27;.&quot; James &quot;Eddie&quot; Draper became the mayor and owner of Corral City. Carlise said that to Draper, &quot;it was a boomtown waiting to happen.&quot;

In October 2016, Corral City was renamed to Draper in honor of former mayor James &quot;Eddie&quot; Draper. However, the name reverted back to Corral City in 2020.

<text>Denton is a city in the U.S. state of Texas and the county seat of Denton County. With a population of 139,869 as of 2020, it is the 20th-most populous city in Texas, the 177th-most populous city in the United States, and the 12th-most populous city in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.

A Texas land grant led to the formation of Denton County in 1846, and the city was incorporated in 1866. Both were named after pioneer and Texas militia captain John B. Denton. The arrival of a railroad line in the city in 1881 spurred population, and the establishment of the University of North Texas in 1890 and Texas Woman&#x27;s University in 1901 distinguished the city from neighboring regions. After the construction of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport finished in 1974, the city had more rapid growth; as of 2011, Denton was the seventh-fastest growing city with a population of over 100,000 in the country.

Located on the far north end of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex in North Texas on Interstate 35, Denton is known for its active music scene; the North Texas State Fair and Rodeo, Denton Arts and Jazz Festival, and Thin Line Fest attract over 300,000 people to the city each year. The city has hot, humid summers and few extreme weather events. Its diverse citizenry is represented by a nonpartisan city council, and numerous county and state departments have offices in the city. With over 45,000 students enrolled at the two universities within its city limits, Denton is often characterized as a college town. As a result of the universities&#x27; growth, educational services play a large role in the city&#x27;s economy. Residents are served by the Denton County Transportation Authority, which provides commuter rail and bus service to the area.

==History==

Denton&#x27;s formation is closely tied to that of Denton County. White settlement of the area began in the mid-1800s when William S. Peters of Kentucky obtained a land grant from the Texas Congress and named it Peters Colony. After initial settlement in the southeast part of the county in 1843, the Texas Legislature voted to form Denton County in 1846. Both the county and the town were named for John B. Denton, a preacher and lawyer who was killed in 1841 during a skirmish with the Kichai people in what is now Tarrant County. Pickneyville and Alton were selected as the county seat before Denton was named the seat in 1857. That year, a commission laid out the city and named the first streets.

On July 8, 1860, approximately half of the downtown Square burned down in what was later called the &quot;Texas Troubles&quot;. Fires occurred in ten Texas communities that day, including Dallas and Pilot Point, and were quickly attributed to a slave insurrection. By the end of July, vigilante justice took hold and &quot;[r]egularly constituted law-enforcement agencies stepped aside to allow the vigilantes to do their work. Although no hard evidence was ever adduced to prove the guilt of a single alleged black arsonist or white abolitionist, many unfortunates of both classes were nevertheless hanged for their alleged crimes.&quot;

In February 1861, a statewide referendum was held and Texans voted to join the Confederate States of America.

=== Post–Civil War ===
Denton incorporated in 1866; its first mayor was J.B. Sawyer. As the city expanded beyond its original boundaries (which extended half a mile in every direction from center of the public square), it became an agricultural trade center for the mill and cottage industries. The arrival of the Texas and Pacific Railway in 1881 gave Denton its first rail connection and brought an influx of people to the area. North Texas Normal College, now the University of North Texas, was established in 1890, and the Girls&#x27; Industrial College, now Texas Woman&#x27;s University, was founded in 1901. As the universities increased in size, their impact on Denton&#x27;s economy and culture increased. Electricity came to Denton in 1905 with the creation of Denton Municipal Electric.

=== Segregation and Jim Crow era ===
After the Civil War, &quot;Freedmen Settlements&quot; were started throughout the South. One Freedman Settlement, Quakertown, thrived just south of what is now Texas Woman&#x27;s University until around 1920, when the city government forcibly removed the residents to make way for a park. Quakertown&#x27;s Black children were served separately from white children by the Frederick Douglass School. Originally scheduled to open in September 1913, it was mysteriously burned down the night before its scheduled opening. It was rebuilt and in 1949 renamed the &quot;Fred Moore School&quot;.

=== Postwar growth ===
Denton&#x27;s population grew from 26,844 in 1960 to 48,063 in 1980. Its connection to the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex via I-35E and I-35W played a major role in the growth, and the opening of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in 1974 led to a population increase. In the 1980s, heavy manufacturing companies like Victor Equipment Company and Peterbilt joined older manufacturing firms such as Moore Business Forms and Morrison Milling Company in Denton. The population rose from 66,270 in 1990 to 80,537 in 2000. In May 2006, Houston-based real estate company United Equities purchased the 100-block of Fry Street and announced that several of the historic buildings would be demolished and the businesses displaced to accommodate a new mixed-use commercial center. Some residents, who sought to preserve the area as a historic and cultural icon, opposed the proposal. The Denton City Council approved a new proposal for the area from Dinerstein Cos in 2010.

Listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, the former county courthouse was restored for the Texas Sesquicentennial in 1986. The positive response to the renovation sparked a downtown revitalization program that generated new jobs and reinvestment capital. The downtown square is populated by local shops and restaurants, some of which have been in business since the 1940s. Each year, the downtown square is adorned with lights and spotlighted during the Denton Holiday Lighting Festival.

In 1918, the Daughters of the Confederacy erected the Denton Confederate Soldier Monument, a granite, arched monument topped with a statue of a Confederate soldier, in the Denton Square on the courthouse lawn.

The City of Denton Water Utilities Department serves the city&#x27;s water demand. Atmos Energy provides the city&#x27;s natural gas. Denton is a part of the Sister Cities International program and maintains cultural and economic exchange programs with its sister cities, Madaba, Jordan, and San Nicolás de los Garza, Mexico.

Denton is a voluntary member of the North Central Texas Council of Governments association, the purpose of which is to coordinate individual and collective local governments and facilitate regional solutions, eliminate unnecessary duplication, and enable joint decisions.

===Politics===
Denton historically is a solidly Republican-voting city, but it has become more competitive in national elections as its population has diversified, shifting toward the Democratic Party in more recent elections.

===Federal and state government===
After the 2021 redistricting process, new and significantly different political boundaries were set for Denton County. Starting in 2023, most of Denton will be in the 13th Congressional district. The southwest portions of the city will be in the 26th Congressional district.

Almost all of the city is in newly drawn Texas House district 64. Some portions of south, north, and far east Denton are in Texas House districts 57 and 106. All of the city is in the new Texas Senate district 30, except for some western portions in district 12.

Several Texas state agencies have facilities in the city, including a Texas Workforce Center, a Texas Department of Public Safety office, a Texas Department of Criminal Justice office, and a Denton District Parole Office.

The Denton State Supported Living Center, formerly Denton State School, is Texas&#x27;s largest residential facility for people with developmental disabilities. It serves an 18-county area and employs approximately 1,500 people.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has its Region VI headquarters in Denton.

=== County and municipal government ===
All Denton city council and mayoral terms are two years, unlike in most cities in the area, which use three-year terms. Even-numbered years bring the elections of the three at-large seats, places 5 &amp; 6 and mayor. Odd-numbered years bring the elections of the four district council members.

==Education==

===Primary and secondary schools===

Denton Independent School District (DISD) provides the public primary and secondary educational system in the majority of the city. The district comprises four comprehensive high schools (Braswell, Denton, Guyer, and Ryan), two alternative high schools, and multiple elementary and middle schools. Small portions of the city extend into the Argyle, Krum, Ponder, and Sanger school districts. The respective comprehensive high schools of these districts are: Argyle, Krum, Ponder, and Sanger.

Denton is also host to several private schools with religious affiliations and alternative education models. According to the 2010 United States Census, 35.1% of all adults over the age of 25 in Denton have obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree, as compared to the state average of 25.8%, and 86.1% of residents over the age of 25 have earned a high school diploma, as compared to the state average of 80%.

The high school residential program Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, for gifted students, is in Denton.

The Roman Catholic Immaculate Conception Catholic School, a K–8 school of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Worth, opened in 1995. Construction on the current facility started on July 15, 2001, with its opening on August 19, 2002.

The charter school operator Life&#x27;s Beautiful Educational Centers Inc. (closed 1999) operated the school L.O.V.E. in Denton.

===Public libraries===

Denton is served by the Denton Public Library, which has three branches: Emily Fowler Central Library, North Branch Library, and South Branch Library.

===University of North Texas===

The University of North Texas (UNT) in Denton is the flagship university of the University of North Texas System, which also includes the UNT Health Science Center in Fort Worth, the University of North Texas at Dallas, UNT Dallas College of Law, and a satellite campus in Frisco. With an enrollment of over 42,000, it&#x27;s the fifth largest university in Texas. The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Its College of Music, the first school to offer a degree in the field of jazz studies, is internationally recognized and known for producing successful artists.

===Texas Woman&#x27;s University===
Texas Woman&#x27;s University (TWU) is a public university system in Denton with two health science center campuses in Dallas and Houston. Founded in 1901, the university enrolls more than 13,000 undergraduates and graduates. Men have been admitted to TWU since 1972 but make up less than ten percent of the university. TWU&#x27;s College of Nursing is the second largest in Texas and in the top 20 of largest nursing programs in the United States, and the school&#x27;s nursing doctoral program is the largest in the world.

===FSB Exchange at NCTC Denton===
North Central Texas College (NCTC) is a public community college based in Gainesville, Texas. Starting in the 2019–2020 school year, North Central Texas College partnered with First State Bank to open a branch campus in downtown Denton. Located in the former Denton Record-Chronicle building, the campus focuses on accounting, business, biology, early childhood education, kinesiology, psychology, and general studies.

==Media==

Since 1899, the &quot;Denton Record-Chronicle&quot; has been the newspaper of record for Denton. When it was acquired by Belo Corporation in 1999, the newspaper had a circulation of 16,000. The &quot;North Texas Daily&quot; and &quot;The Lasso&quot; provide daily and weekly news to students at the University of North Texas and Texas Woman&#x27;s University. The city&#x27;s public television station, Denton TV (DTV), covers city council meetings, restaurant scores, high school football, and educational programming. UNT&#x27;s television station, ntTV, is broadcast on local channels provided by Charter Communications and Verizon Communications. &quot;ntTV News&quot; is broadcast live Monday through Thursday. KNTU 88.1 FM is UNT&#x27;s official radio station. First aired in 1969, the station primarily plays a mixture of jazz and blues and covers local sports and news.

==Infrastructure==

=== Health care ===

Two major hospitals operate in Denton: Medical City Denton and Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Denton are both full-service hospitals with differing capacities: 208 beds and 255 beds, respectively. Each employs more than 800 employees and are licensed with emergency services.

===Fracking ban===
In response to the previously mentioned, 2014 city referendum prohibiting hydraulic fracturing (fracking) that passed with 59% of the vote, Texas enacted a law specifying &quot;the exclusive jurisdiction of this state to regulate oil and gas operations in this state and the express preemption of local regulation of those operations&quot;, though it allows some &quot;commercially reasonable&quot; rules. Denton&#x27;s city council put out a statement affirming it will &quot;continue to enforce our current regulations to protect the health and safety of our residents, but we do not know how the operators or courts will react&quot;.

==Transportation==

I-35E and I-35W, which split in Hillsboro south of the Metroplex and come north through Dallas and Fort Worth respectively, rejoin near the University of North Texas campus in the southwest part of Denton to form Interstate 35 as it continues north on its way to Oklahoma. Loop 288 partially encircles the city; it passes through the northern limits of the city by C. H. Collins Athletic Complex and the eastern side near Golden Triangle Mall. Highway 77 and 377 go through the historic town square and Highway 380 connects Denton to Frisco and McKinney in the east and Decatur in the west. Denton Enterprise Airport is a public airport located west of the central business district (CBD) of Denton. This airport serves as home to various cargo and charter operators as well as two flight schools. A new terminal opened in 2008, but as of June 2008 no scheduled commuter service is in place.

===Mass transit===
Denton is served by the Denton County Transportation Authority (DCTA), which operates local bus service, on-demand GoZone service, and regional rail to Lewisville and Carrollton, with connections to Dallas&#x27; DART rail system. In 2011, Downtown Denton Transit Center and Medpark Station opened as commuter rail stations on DCTA&#x27;s A-train, which now has five stations and connects to the Green Line of Dallas Area Rapid Transit&#x27;s (DART) Green Line at Trinity Mills Station. The two transit companies, along with the Trinity Rail Express (TRE) of Fort Worth, offer regional passes to be used on any of the three systems. As of August, 2017 (no deadline announced), rides between the first two (DDTC and Medpark) and the last two (Hebron and Trinity Mills) are &quot;fare-free&quot;, though any ride to or through the 3rd stop (Lewisville Lake) will require a paid pass. DCTA states this will relocate downtown parking needs to the underutilized space at Medpark station, and enhance mobility in Downtown Denton, including for students, as well as for residents of Hebron who connect to the DART system one stop away at Trinity Mills.

DCTA also operates the Connect local bus service within Denton, special university shuttles, and on-demand GoZone services in partnership with TransitTech provider Via Transportation. All Connect services (not the A-train) are free of charge for students at the University of North Texas who swipe their ID at the bus entrance. Special Programs for Aging Needs (SPAN), a non-profit organization, offers paratransit service for senior citizens and people with disabilities of all ages.

<doc id="135771" wikidata="Q981832" url="?curid=135771" title="Hebron, Texas">
<text>Hebron is a town in Denton County in the U.S. state of Texas, with a small, disconnected section in Collin County. The population was 803 at the 2020 census, and according to 2023 census estimates, the city is estimated to have a population of 224.

==History==
Hebron was founded in the 1890s and was alternatively known as &quot;Shepton&quot;. The land was donated by the Blackland Townsite Company, a subsidiary of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad. Historically, the town center was based near the intersection of two railroads, near present-day East Hebron Parkway and 1st Street. Much of that town center has been cleared and developed.

The town was first incorporated in 1961 as a method to prevent Plano and Carrollton from annexing the territory and imposing taxes. The city of Hebron imposed no taxes of its own, and when the time was ripe for a landowner to develop his land, he would ask the town to disannex that parcel. Hebron&#x27;s city limits once covered about from the Collin County line west to the Trinity River and from the Dallas County line north to State Highway 121. Now it comprises a few plots of land connected with narrow strips and easements, which confuses many maps. Stanley Dozier, the namesake of Dozier Road, was the only mayor of the town between 1961 and 1997. The town is currently managed by a three-person commission with Kelly Clem as the mayor.

Air Park-Dallas Airport was built as a public civilian airstrip within the city limits in 1965.

For the last 20 years, Hebron has disannexed large portions of its territory to be annexed by neighboring communities (Lewisville, The Colony, Carrollton, and Plano) instead. The original goal was for Hebron to disappear entirely as an incorporated community, but recently elected leaders have attempted to reverse the situation and allow Hebron to continue as a town. This is partially in response to the city of Carrollton&#x27;s threatening not to maintain the water supply unless the town is annexed to Carrollton.

==Geography==

Hebron is located in southeastern Denton County. A small, disconnected piece of the town is in southwestern Collin County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

<text>Justin is a city in Denton County, Texas, United States. The population was 4,409 in 2020. It is also an outer ring suburb of Fort Worth.

==History==
In 1848, approximately 70 followers of the French utopian socialist Étienne Cabet arrived in what is now Justin to found an Icarian community. The attempt failed.

Contrary to popular belief, the town is not named after or related to the Justin Boot Company. In January 1887 the community petitioned postal authorities for a post office to be named Justin, in honor of Justin Sherman, a chief engineer with the Santa Fe Railroad.

Justin once was a center of salvage companies, which buy property involved in fires and tornadoes and sell it for discounted prices. In the late 1970s Western wear became very popular, and the Wallace family&#x27;s salvage operations began to focus on Western wear. The other two major salvage businesses closed, and the salvage industry disappeared.

The Texas Motor Speedway had a Justin mailing address until July 9, 2005. Because it is physically located in the city of Fort Worth, Justin had the opportunity to purchase the Texas Motor Speedway but at the time they did not have enough money to run and provide maintenance to the speedway, the United States Postal Service changed the mailing address to Fort Worth, Texas.

WFAA-TV, Channel 8, has operated a 750 kilowatt Doppler weather radar out of Justin since January 25, 1995.

One of the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, Yaser Abdel Said, was captured in Justin on August 26, 2020.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Some areas along FM 156 and Hwy 114 use the Justin ZIP code (76247), even though the land is within the city of Fort Worth.

The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Justin has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==


As of the 2020 United States census, there were 4,409 people, 1,610 households, and 1,129 families residing in the city.

==Education==
Justin is within the Northwest Independent School District. Residents are zoned to Justin Elementary School, Gene Pike Middle School, and Northwest High School.

Lincoln Park is one of several towns that incorporated in Denton County in the early 1970s to sell alcohol in this otherwise dry county. Incorporated in 1971, Lincoln Park served the Denton to McKinney corridor of U.S. Highway 380, supplying both college students from Denton and travelers passing through with drinks. After both Denton and McKinney voted to allow alcoholic sales in their cities, Lincoln Park began to decline. Previously it consisted of the original mobile home park, a liquor store and a Trail Dust Steak House restaurant.

Due to the land being sold for redevelopment to Centurion American Development, on March 29, 2015, the Trail Dust Steakhouse closed permanently and has been leveled. Also on the same day residents of Lincoln Park were notified that the land was also sold for redevelopment with all residents having to leave or relocate their homes before the end of June. The mobile home park has since been vacated.

Little Elm struck a deal with an arm of Centurion American Development, a mega-developer that has built everything from high-rises to master-planned, vastly upscale residential enclaves.

In 2014, Centurion made a deal with Nathaniel Parker III, father of Tan Parker (Texas House of Representatives) to purchase the acreage in and around Lincoln Park, one of the state&#x27;s fastest growing areas. Little Elm then annexed Lincoln Park in an acrimonious and legally disputed maneuver in April.

<text>Little Elm is a city in Denton County, Texas, United States, and a part of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. It is an extended suburb of Denton; its population was 46,453 as of the 2020 census. In 2000, the census population was at 3,646. By the 2010 census, the city total had jumped to 25,898, making Little Elm one of the fastest-growing municipalities by percentage in Texas since 2000. The July 1, 2022 census estimates Little Elm&#x27;s population as 55,357.

==History==
Little Elm was established along Lewisville Lake by C.C. &quot;Kit&quot; King, son of John and Delilah King, in 1844. King named the community after the creek banks where it was located. King helped organize mail service for the area and in 1852 was named the postmaster of Denton County&#x27;s first post office. The population was very low throughout the first half of the 20th century, but in 1966 the community was able to officially incorporate. The first official census for the town came in 1970, which recorded 363 persons.

On the second of March 2023, a very powerful storm came through north Texas. It caused damages across the area but most notably, a supermarket&#x27;s facade was completely torn off, covering several automobiles parked in the parking lot.

==Geography==

Little Elm is generally located along the northern and eastern shores of Lewisville Lake at the crossroads of Eldorado Parkway, FM 720, and FM 423, and includes stretches of U.S. Highway 380. Its neighbors include Frisco to the east, The Colony and Hackberry to the south, Prosper, Aubrey, Savannah, and Providence to the north, and Oak Point, Cross Roads, Hickory Creek, Lake Dallas, and Lakewood Village to the west.

The city is about 33 miles north of the City of Dallas, 53 miles north of the City of Fort Worth, 23 miles north of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, and 20 miles east of the City of Denton, the county seat of Denton County.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, it has a total area of , of which is land and , or 21.83%, is covered by water. Little Elm has an average elevation of 545 feet above sea level.

===Climate===

Little Elm has a humid subtropical climate typical for Northeast Texas.
==Demographics==


&quot;Note: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category. This table excludes Latinos from the racial categories and assigns them to a separate category. Hispanics/Latinos can be of any race.&quot;

Little Elm&#x27;s Census population, as of April 1, 2020, was 46,453. Little Elm&#x27;s build-out population is anticipated to be about 90,000.

==Government==
===Politics===
Historically a Republican-voting town, it has become more competitive in statewide and national elections as its population has diversified and grown in size, shifting toward the Democratic Party in more recent elections.
=== Local government ===
Little Elm became a home rule municipality in 2001. It has a council-manager form of government. The town council consists of a mayor and five city council members, one of whom is elected at-large.

The city holds annual municipal elections in March, and run-off elections when necessary in June. Terms for both the offices of the mayor and council are three years, with term limits of three years.

The city has a number of extraterritorial jurisdictions that also vote in municipal elections.

In June 2021, Little Elm elected its first African American mayor, Curtis Cornelious, who previously served two and a half terms on town council as the at-large council member before resigning to run for mayor.

=== State government ===
After the 2021 state and federal redistricting, the town of Little Elm is located almost wholly within Texas State House of Representatives district 57, with tiny portions in district 106. Likewise, most of Little Elm is in Texas State Senate district 12, with some small portions in district 30.

=== Federal government ===
Following the 2021 state and federal redistricting, the town of Little Elm is located entirely within United States Congressional district 26.

==Education==
Three school districts primarily serve Little Elm: Little Elm ISD, Frisco ISD, and Denton ISD. Generally, the U.S. 380 corridor is served by Denton ISD, the FM 423 corridor and east Little Elm by Frisco ISD, and the rest of Little Elm by Little Elm ISD. A small portion of land in city boundaries is also served by Aubrey ISD.

The Little Elm Independent School District serves most of the original parts of Little Elm. Little Elm ISD is one of the fastest-growing in Denton County. The school district finished building its athletic stadium in 2006 located at the intersection of Hart Road and Eldorado Parkway. The stadium has a seating capacity of 7,500 with great wheelchair accessibility, a newly renovated video board at the north endzone, and a three level state-of-the-art press box. Although the intent is to keep the community a one-high-school town, two new middle schools opened for the 2020-2021 school year. Most of the city in LEISD goes to Walker Middle School, while small portions go to Strike Middle School.

A portion of the city is within the Frisco Independent School District. Robertson Elementary, which is in Little Elm, along with Stafford Middle School serve part of Sunset Pointe and Frisco Ranch; with other schools outside the city also serving small portions of the area. Lone Star High School also serves most of the city that is under Frisco ISD.

During the summer of 2016, Denton ISD completed construction on its fourth comprehensive high school, Braswell High School, located at the southeast corner of Navo Road and U.S. 380, to serve the fast-growing University Drive corridor, which is part of Little Elm. Along with Braswell, other Denton schools serve the northern area of the city. Navo Middle School and Union Park Elementary are located in the city; while Bell Elementary, Paloma Creek Elementary, Providence Elementary, and Rodriguez Middle School serve portions of Little Elm despite being out of the city&#x27;s boundaries.

A small chunk of US 380, although uninhabited, is zoned to Prosper ISD.

== Economy ==
While Little Elm is often referred to as a &quot;bedroom community&quot;, five companies/entities in the city employ over 100 people, per the Little Elm EDC – Little Elm ISD (853), The Town of Little Elm (311), Kroger (191), Lowe&#x27;s Home Center (178), and Retractable Technologies (146). The 2019 Retail Trade population was 203,560. The unemployment rate in Little Elm, pre-Covid-19, was 3.7%. Little Elm residents work in a variety of sectors, including retail trade (13.9%), finance/insurance (11.6%), professional/scientific/technical services (10.8%), construction (8.6%), and educational services (8.5%).

The original downtown area of Little Elm, commonly known as &quot;The Lakefront&quot;, has seen much investment in recent years. Multiple restaurants and entertainment options have established themselves in the area near Eldorado and Main Street, and multiple middle to upper income apartment developments have been completed or are in planning/construction phases. This has created a localized densification effect in a desirable area of the city, a city which is otherwise known for its sprawl and single family zoning patterns.

==Awards and honors==

The Arbor Day Foundation designated Little Elm a Tree City USA community for its commitment to urban forestry for three straight years (2011–2013).

The Texas Chapter of the American Planning Association honored Little Elm with its Certificate of Achievement for Planning Excellence award for 2007, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014.

In 2013, the Cross Timbers Urban Forestry Council presented Little Elm with its Bronze Leaf Award for its commitment to urban forestry initiatives. 

In 2013, Little Elm was named the safest city in Texas by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the 18th-safest in the nation for cities with a population of 25,000 or higher. In 2016, Little Elm was ranked the 13th safest by the FBI in the state of Texas for towns with a population of 10,000 or higher.

==Parks==

Little Elm has five major community parks: Little Elm Park, Cottonwood Park, Beard Park, McCord Park, and Union Park. Cottonwood Park, located in the Lakefront district at the southern terminus of Lobo Lane, is home to Cottonwood Creek Marina.


Beard Park is the future home of Little Elm&#x27;s Farmers Market, which in 2013 was set up in the Hobby Lobby shopping center.

McCord Park is a wooded, 38-acre park including trails, a disc golf course, a fishing dock, and a playground. The disc golf course was designed by John Houck, a world-renowned disc golf course designer.

Through creative planning and zoning, McCord Park was donated to the city and constructed by the developers of the luxury multifamily projects adjacent to it. The total value of the land and park improvements was estimated to be over $5 million, all of which was paid for by the developer. Vital to the city&#x27;s master hike and bike trail plan, McCord Park provides an invaluable link from FM 423 to Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Bridge on Witt Road and eventually westward along Lewisville Lake to the Lakefront district. It also offers a critical connection point into Frisco&#x27;s trail system, which is part of a regional master trail system, one day ensuring that Little Elm residents could continually travel to Dallas via trail without interruption.

== Infrastructure ==
Little Elm has access to the rest of the DFW metroplex via several regionally significant thoroughfares. The Dallas North Tollway is a 5-minute drive east of Little Elm, which opens up the greater north Dallas region to residents, including several large employment and shopping hubs. DFW Airport is about 30 minutes away by car, and Love Field is about 35 minutes by car.

Eldorado Parkway, a six-lane E/W thoroughfare through most of Little Elm, functions as the city&#x27;s main street. Eldorado provides a critical connection to the region by linking U.S. 75 and I-35E, including the Lewisville Lake Toll Bridge.

FM 423 serves as Little Elm&#x27;s eastern boundary, although it crosses east of FM 423 in several places. This six-lane thoroughfare connects SH 121 in The Colony to the U.S. 380 corridor. The U.S. 380 corridor is in the northern part of Little Elm and provides an invaluable regional connection between two of the four county seats of the Metroplex (McKinney and Denton).

As of late 2021, TxDOT is planning to expand US 380 to a six-lane divided roadway with grade separations at specific intersections, and is currently at a 95% design phase. Other changes include continuous illumination along the corridor with the goal to improve nighttime visibility and safety. The primary goal of this project is to simultaneously improve through-traffic from Denton to McKinney (and vice versa) and to provide easier, safer accessibility to businesses and housing developments on either side of the 380 corridor. As of Feb 1, 2022, the plan is currently on a temporary hold due to budget changes from TxDOT. 

The Lewisville Lake Toll Bridge, a North Texas Tollway Authority project, was opened to the public on August 1, 2009. The authority also completed the Dallas North Tollway Extension Phase III in September 2007.

Little Elm is not currently served by any public transportation, and it does not border any municipality that has DART service. There is no bus, light rail, or regional rail public transportation. The closest and northernmost Green Line station is North Carrollton/Frankford station and is just under 19 miles by car from Little Elm City Hall. The closest and northernmost Red and Orange Line station is Parker Road station and is 24 miles by car from City Hall. Alternatively, the closest DCTA station is Highland Village station and is just over 12 miles by car from City Hall. The DCTA A-train connects at Trinity Mills station along the DART Green Line with a 30 minute service interval, reduced Saturday service, and no Sunday service. The A train does not have service after 10:30 pm on weekdays.

== Major thoroughfares (WIP) ==

=== Eldorado Parkway ===
Alternatively known as the &quot;main street&quot; of Little Elm, this six-lane thoroughfare passes through the center of town and provides connections to Lake Dallas, Lakewood Village, Denton, Frisco, Plano, and McKinney. It also runs as different farm to market roads, and the LLTB.

It starts off in Lake Dallas as the Lewisville Lake Toll Bridge coming in from Swisher, and bears northeastward through Lewisville Lake. Upon reaching land, it curves north and continues upon that direction. After approaching a middle school, it starts curving again as it enters Oak Grove, as it becomes FM 720. It continues as it curves and then heads southeast into the lake again in another chunk of land. It does a curve a bit more and goes northeast. Once it intersects with Hart Rd. Upon intersection, it heads east, and as it goes around &quot;Villages of Woodlake&quot; (Little Elm community), it curves northeast. While headed northeast, FM 720 splits off and becomes Little Elm Parkway, and Eldorado continues said direction until intersecting with Walker Lane. Once it reaches that street, it continues east and past FM 423 it stays east heading into Frisco and the DNT.

=== Woodlake Parkway/Witt Rd ===
This street is primarily a north-south thoroughfare which primarily runs through Little Elm, that also provides access to Frisco via the south side of Witt, and Panther Creek Pkwy which runs after the end of Woodlake. Along with Frisco, it also provides a way of transfer for those in Hackberry, along with McKinney if the City of Frisco expands it to SH 289.

It begins at FM 423 as Woodlake Parkway, and the street before that is Panther Creek Pkwy in Frisco. It begins westward, but almost immediately starts curving through the Sunset Point neighborhood. Once finished, it intersects with Walker Ln and continues south. It continues as so for most of the route with some slight curves here and there. South of Eldorado is known as Witt Road. Once reaching Old Witt Rd, it exits Little Elm and enters Frisco.

=== Walker Lane ===
This street is an east-west road that connects the High School to the rest of town and Eldorado Parkway. It is entirely within Little Elm.

It begins at Eldorado Pkwy, and continues west towards Eldorado West. It slights north and continues west right after. After passing by LEHS, it stays west until approaching Hart Road, when it goes northwest as Stardust Trail.

=== Farm roads and highways ===
&quot;See FM 423, FM 720, DNT, and US 380&quot;

== Housing ==
The vast majority of Little Elm&#x27;s residents reside in single family homes, usually in master-planned subdivisions built between the late 1990s and late 2010s. Because central Little Elm is surrounded on three sides by Lake Lewisville, apartments and townhomes have begun establishing themselves in the town&#x27;s core as the need for denser, walkable housing has become more apparent. In The Lakefront district alone, there are more than 550 apartment units within walking distance to multiple restaurants, shops, and entertainment options, per Apartments.com analysis.

<text>Marshall Creek was a town in Denton County, Texas, United States, with a population of 431 at the 2000 census. Initially an independent town, it consolidated with In late November 2007, Marshall Creek consolidated with neighboring Roanoke, Texas.

== History ==
Original residents began moving into the small area in the late 1960s, attracted to inexpensive country living. The town had no formal government until it was incorporated in 1983 to prevent possible annexation by neighboring cities which would bring higher tax rates and stricter regulations. The town took the name of a nearby park operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The town was originally designed as an affordable location to purchase land for manufactured (or &quot;mobile&quot;) homes.

== Politics ==
Incorporated as a general law municipality in 1983, Marshall Creek remained, by virtue of its small borders, relatively out of the public spotlight. However, internal strife caused the town to become unstable. According to published reports, bookkeeping by the government was spotty, resulting in losses from unpaid property taxes the town failed to assess. In 1996, the government fell behind in payments to the Trinity River Authority, which removed and treated sewage for the town.

After the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, the small town, with its equivalently small police force, lost a sizable contract to patrol nearby Marshall Creek Park. Instead, the Army Corps of Engineers awarded that contract to nearby Trophy Club, which had a larger and more experienced force. In addition, in 2002, police officers who had written traffic tickets for the city on nearby US Highway 377 were revealed to have expired peace officer certifications, thus rendering those citations invalid. The town was forced to repay approximately US$4,300 in traffic fines.

As a result of the loss of income from the Corps of Engineers contract as well as poor records management and having virtually no other revenue source than property taxes and traffic citations, the town filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code in January 2006.

The town&#x27;s last mayor before consolidation was James Macy-Simpson.

== Consolidation ==
As part of the May 12, 2007, general election, Marshall Creek voters were asked if they wished to consolidate with the nearby town of Roanoke. This proposition was approved by a vote of 72–18. Roanoke voters decided on November 6, 2007, to consolidate Marshall Creek into Roanoke by an 83% margin. Roanoke canvassed the election on November 19, 2007, and the consolidation became official.

<text>Shady Shores is a town in Denton County, Texas, United States. The population was 2,764 at the 2020 census. It is also one of four communities in the Lake Cities.

==History==

There was a Shady Shores Independent School in 1912. In the mid-1920s, John William Franck, a Dallas contractor, built a fishing camp with about ten wood-shingle cabins on the northern shores of Lake Dallas. He had this in mind as a weekend retreat for Dallas residents. In the 1930s, many of the fishing camps were torn down and replaced by permanent homes, a number of which are still standing.

The community thrived, and in 1932, a nearby subdivision called Shady Shores began construction. The lake was enlarged in the late 1950s, becoming what is now known as Lewisville Lake. In 1960, the city leaders decided to incorporate – mostly to escape being annexed by Denton – and the subdivision&#x27;s name became the name of a newly formed town. Up until 2000, when tax collection began, money for road repairs and police and fire protection came from fees from building permits, franchise fees, pancake suppers and donations from the residents.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and 0.34% is water.

<text>The Colony is a city in Denton County, Texas, United States, and a suburb of Dallas. The population was 44,534 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The Colony derives its name from the original Peters Colony. The Peters Colony headquarters was located within the current boundaries of The Colony in the historical community of Stewartsville and the site of the Hedgcoxe War. The Colony is also the site of Bridges Settlement (established during the years of the Republic of Texas and the oldest community in Denton County), Stewarts Creek, Rector, Stoverville and Camey, also known as Camey Spur.

One of the oldest portions of The Colony is Bridges Cemetery, established in 1857 on land owned by the Bridges family, is found on Morningstar Drive. The cemetery gates stand closed to the public except during certain dates when it is open to visitors by the local history committee.

The Colony did not exist before 1973, when home developers Fox and Jacobs (which became part of Centex) purchased located around State Highway 121 and Farm to Market Road 423. The name &quot;The Colony&quot; was chosen by Fox and Jacobs because they wanted its new development to share a sense of kinship with Texas&#x27; early history and &quot;to create a living monument to the spirit and courage of the Peters Colonists ... those men and women who braved considerable hardships to begin new lives, in new homes, on new land.&quot; They planned the development to be a new &quot;dream city&quot; consisting primarily of single-family homes grouped as a &quot;colony&quot; and based on the city of Dallas&#x27; infrastructure specifications. In 1973, Fox and Jacobs negotiated an agreement with the city of Frisco to begin construction in its extraterritorial jurisdiction. In 1974, street construction began with many streets being named after early settlers and members of the construction crews. The first model homes were completed in August 1974 and the first families moved into their homes in October that year. The homes were served for water services by The Colony Municipal Utility District formed in 1974, electricity via Texas Power and Light, cable television via Lakeside CATV and telephone service via Southwestern Bell.

In 1977, the homeowners associations&#x27; petition to disannex the development from the city of Frisco&#x27;s extraterritorial jurisdiction was approved. The Colony voted to become an incorporated city in January 1977 and became a Home Rule City in 1979. Residents of The Colony participated in two polls to select a name for the new city. Both polls chose the name &quot;The Colony&quot; and the name was ratified by the City Council in May 1977. In 1987, The Colony voted to merge with the small lakeside community of Eastvale.

==Geography==
The Colony is located at (33.090874, –96.884659). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 12.93%, is water.

The city is bordered on the west by Lewisville Lake and the city of Lewisville, on the north and east by Frisco, and on the south by the cities of Carrollton and Plano. Approximately of shoreline on Lewisville Lake (including two peninsulas) are contained within the city&#x27;s boundaries, thus providing the basis for the city&#x27;s nickname &quot;City by the Lake.&quot;

==Demographics==


According to the 2020 United States census, there were 44,534 people, 17,401 households, and 10,957 families residing in the city. In 2017, there were 41,388 people. The racial makeup of the city was 74.6% White, 11.2% African American, 5.3% Asian, 0.4% Native American, 5.1% from other races, and 3.4% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 19.2% of the population. In 2020, the racial and ethnic makeup was 53.2% non-Hispanic white, 9,73% African American, 0.37% Native American, 8.78% Asian, 0.07% Pacific Islander, 0.41% some other race, 4.92% multiracial, and 22.52% Hispanic or Latino of any race.

==Politics==
The Colony is a home rule municipality with a council-manager form of government. It has a six-member council, with two members elected at large, as well as a city mayor. All meetings of the City Council are open to the public, and meetings are broadcast live on Time Warner Cable government access Channel 16, AT&amp;T Uverse channel 99, as well as on the broadcast page of The Colony&#x27;s website.

In November 2021, Richard Boyer ran unopposed to become mayor of The Colony, succeeding Joe McCourry who had been mayor of The Colony for 11 years.

===Council members===

The Colony has several Boards and Commissions, all of which list their current members, Term expiration dates, and meeting minutes on The Colony&#x27;s website. Meetings usually have time setup in the agenda for Citizen input which can be submitted by email or presented in person at most board&#x27;s meetings. Board applications are available on The Colony&#x27;s website or at City Hall and a list of currently vacant positions can be found on the site as well.

== Education ==
The Colony is located inside both the Lewisville Independent School District (LISD) and Little Elm Independent School District.

Lewisville ISD has built six elementary schools, two middle schools and one high school inside the city limits. The elementary schools are Peters Colony Elementary, Camey Elementary, B.B. Owen Elementary, Stewart&#x27;s Creek Elementary (retired 2020–2021), Ethridge Elementary, and Morningside Elementary. The two middle schools are Griffin Middle School and Lakeview Middle School.

Little Elm ISD built Prestwick STEM Academy in 2014, which serves K–8 in The Tribute subdivision, as well as Strike Middle school (opened Fall of 2020) which also serves the residents from The Tribute subdivision. Strike Middle School is named after former superintendent Dr. Lowell H. Strike who served the district for three years.

During a December 2020 meeting of the LISD Board, several changes were made, including rezoning the area and a closure of one of the elementary schools. Effective the end of the 2020–2021 school year, the LISD board voted to close Stewart&#x27;s Creek Elementary. Many of the students affected by the rezoning will be attending the new school LISD is building to service the area opening for the 2021–2022 school year, dubbed by the LISD Board as Memorial Elementary – STEM Academy. There were three written-in names submitted by the community with no clear winner of the LISD Naming Survey: Sterling (The school&#x27;s chosen descriptor of students), Cox (name of B.B. Owen Elementary&#x27;s influential coach and teacher, and supporter of the annual Kids Chase by the Lake ), and Josey Lane (The street the school is on). LISD chose to name the school Memorial elementary instead of the submitted names because &quot;...having a Memorial Elementary School will allow us to have the opportunity to memorialize, if you will, a number of important and influential people in the communities we serve.”

Owing to its original history as part of Frisco, The Colony is located inside the community college district of Collin College, unlike most other places in Denton County. However, since residents of The Colony do not pay taxes to said district they must pay out-of-county tuition rates to attend the college.

In May 2009, Griffin Middle School student and The Colony resident Eric Yang won the National Geographic Bee, beating out 54 other state competition champions to win a scholarship and travel package valued at more than $25,000.

<text>Cuero ( ) is a city in and the county seat of DeWitt County, Texas, United States. Its population was 8,128 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The city of Cuero got its start in the mid-19th century as a stopping point on the Chisholm Trail cattle route to Kansas. According to the &quot;Handbook of Texas Online&quot;, &quot;Gustav Schleicher founded the latter town as a way-station and moved to it soon afterward, in 1872.&quot; It was not recognized as a town until 1873, though, when it was officially founded. The city was named for the Spanish word &quot;hide&quot;, referring to the leather made from animal hides. The industry was extremely short-lived, however, and gave way to various forms of ranching. The city had several Old West gunfights related to clan feuding following the Civil War.

Cuero&#x27;s population grew considerably in the 1870s and 1880s, as residents from the coastal town of Indianola settled here after major hurricanes in this period destroyed sizeable portions of that city. Cuero thrived through much of the late 19th and early 20th centuries by the introduction and practice of turkey ranching in the area. Today, agriculture is still the primary industry in the region. Cuero is considered to be one of the top cattle producers and shippers in Texas.

==Geography==
Cuero is located east of the center of DeWitt County near the mouth of Sandies Creek, where it empties into the Guadalupe River.

U.S. Routes 87, 77 Alternate, and 183 pass through the city. All three highways follow South Esplanade Street into the center of town; US 87 then leaves town via East Broadway Street, while US 77A and 183 continue north out of town on North Esplanade Street. US 87 leads southeast to Victoria and west to San Antonio. US 77 Alternate leads northeast to Yoakum, and US 183 leads north to Gonzales. Both 77 Alternate and 183 lead south to Goliad.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Cuero has a total area of , of which , or 0.36%, is covered by water.

==Arts and culture==
Turkey Fest is a local festival during which the townsfolk compete with people at various turkey-centric events. The competitions revolve around the turkeys each town raises and in which each takes immense pride. The events are the prettiest turkey contest, turkey toss, turkey trot, and turkey race. Unlike most turkey trots, where humans do the racing, in Cuero, the &quot;turkey trot&quot; involves racing actual turkeys.

In 1972, Charles Kuralt did an &quot;On the Road&quot; report for CBS News from Cuero, where he did his own turkey call.

Christmas in Cuero began in 2000 with the lighting of the gazebo in Cuero Municipal Park. It has grown to over 100 displays of Victorian and Western scenes, 12-car trains, gingerbread houses, and other scenes. A live nativity scene is sponsored by a church in Cuero. Two of the scenes were vandalized by two teens in November 2009. The park was still open to the public, excluding the two damaged scenes. The teens arrested for the crime had their bonds set at $150,000, in part because of the effect the crime had on the community.

==Parks and recreation==
Cuero has many places for recreation, including a baseball complex, a golf course, volleyball courts, tennis courts, a basketball pavilion, and a park area with access to public swimming pool.

==Education==
The City of Cuero is served by the Cuero Independent School District. John C. French serves prekindergarten and kindergarten, Hunt Elementary serves grades 1–3, Cuero Intermediate School serves grades 4–6, Cuero Junior High serves grades 7–8, and Cuero High School serves grades 9–12.

=== Lithuanian heritage ===
Yorktown, located in Texas, holds the distinction of being the site of the oldest known Lithuanian-American community in the United States. Although most current Texans of Lithuanian descent are not directly connected to this community, its history remains significant. The first Lithuanians arrived in Texas in 1852, shortly after the Mexican-American War. These early settlers hailed from Lithuania Minor, a region under German control at the time, rather than from the part of Lithuania controlled by the Russian Empire, where serfdom and restricted emigration still prevailed. Upon arrival, the Lithuanians integrated into the German-American communities, as their culture bore similarities to that of the Germans.

The most prominent symbol of Yorktown&#x27;s Lithuanian roots is the Smith Creek Lithuanian Cemetery. In the late 20th century, descendants of the Yorktown Lithuanians restored the cemetery. They erected a sign indicating it as a Lithuanian cemetery and painted the Lithuanian flag. Approximately 30 tombstones remain, although more individuals might have been buried there.

Several descendants of the first Lithuanian Texans funded a memorial plaque in Yorktown. The plaque, written in English, states: &quot;Lithuanians in Texas. Among the many European immigrants arriving in Texas in the mid-19th century was a small group of Lithuanians who settled in the Yorktown vicinity of De Witt County. Due to their eventual assimilation with the numerous German immigrants in the area, the Lithuanians and their contributions to the history of this region were overlooked for generations. Records reveal that the first Lithuanian family to settle in this area probably was that of David and Dora (Scholze) Stanchos. They arrived about 1852, making them among the earliest documented Lithuanian immigrants to America. By 1874 they were joined by about 70 more immigrants, most from the province of Gumbinnen in what was then part of East Prussia. Leaving their homeland for a variety of religious and political reasons, the Lithuanians arrived in Texas primarily through the ports of Galveston and Indianola. Establishing farms in the area, the Lithuanians became American citizens and contributed to the history and culture of this area. Men from the community fought on both sides of the American Civil War. A small graveyard south of Yorktown known as Jonischkies Cemetery contains the interments of many of these early settlers.&quot;This plaque is one of the few Lithuanian-related memorial plaques in the United States.

Yorktown&#x27;s history museum features numerous exhibits related to Lithuanian culture and the first Lithuanians in Yorktown. These include copies of letters written in Lithuanian, 19th-century Lithuanian work tools, a fishing net, and cattle branding irons. 

The first Lithuanians in Yorktown were Lutherans. Together with local Germans, they contributed to the construction of St. Paul Lutheran Church. The first church was built in 1874, and it was completely rebuilt in 1930. Some of the stained-glass windows feature Lithuanian family names, such as the Joniškis family. 

The unique history and longevity of Yorktown&#x27;s Lithuanian community have attracted various researchers from both the United States and Lithuania. A documentary film and several books have been produced about this community, highlighting its cultural significance and historical contributions.

==History==

The city was founded by Captain John York and Charles Eckhardt and named in honor of Captain John York, a famous Indian fighter and was in command of a company of citizens who, under Ben Milam, defeated General Cos in 1835 at the Siege of Béxar. For his military services, York received many acres of land in the Coleto Creek area.

Charles Eckhardt started a mercantile business in Indianola, which at that time was a major Texas seaport. Eckhardt participated in the Texas Revolution and may have met Captain York during military service. Eckhardt contracted with John A. King, one of the pioneers of West Texas, to survey a road from Indianola through Yorktown to New Braunfels, later known as the Old Indianola Trail. From its inception in February, 1848, this road remained the chief thoroughfare for this part of the state to New Braunfels and San Antonio. This trail shortened the former route by twenty miles and established Yorktown as an important relay station for freighters, prairie schooners, trail drivers, and stagecoaches bringing mail and passengers. They came through upper town on North Riedel Street.

Early in 1848, after the founders had the proposed town surveyed, they offered and the choice of a lot free to the first ten families to settle the townsite. Many German, Bohemian, Lithuanian and Polish families came and soon changed this wilderness into one of the most prosperous sections of the entire state.

In May 1848, Peter Metz and John Frank built the first house in the settlement of Yorktown, for Charles Eckhardt. It was built of logs, twelve by twenty feet, with a back room and chimney. This house was later occupied by a brother, Caesar Eckhardt, who was the founder of C. Eckhardt and Sons Mercantile Company, known for half a century as the leading firm of its kind in western DeWitt County.

Unfortunately, neither of the founders lived to see the town develop beyond this point. In October 1848, in a battle with Marauding Indians, Captain York and his son-in-law, James Madison Bell, were killed. They were buried in a single hand-made coffin in the Yorktown Cemetery some seven miles (11 km) east of Yorktown; a historical marker designates York&#x27;s grave. In 1852, on an inspection of some of his properties in Central America, Eckhardt contracted yellow fever and died at sea on his return trip. He is buried in New Orleans. The Eckhardts did not have any children, while the Yorks had ten children.

The Catholics established a church in 1867 and the Lutherans followed in 1872. The huge oak tree on the lawn of the latter church is one of the oldest in the state. The town was incorporated in 1871.

==Western Days==

Celebrated on the third weekend of October, Western Days is a three-day town celebration featuring a carnival, barbecue cook-off, horseshoes and washers tournaments, quilt show, poker run, and street dancing. Western Days is held downtown at the city park. Numerous food booths and art and craft stands line the streets. Saturday morning begins with a large parade through town. Western days is one of the few festivals in the area that charges no admission to the park or dance.

Officially started in 1958, Western Days has its roots dating from the early to mid 1950s with Leslie and Cecil Mueller&#x27;s M&amp;M Rodeo Company organizing cowboy parades to promote the rodeo performances on Smith Creek, just south of Yorktown. A showman and promoter, Leslie Mueller gathered the rodeo cowboys to ride horseback through downtown Yorktown. These processions were said to have been quite a wild sight. Since there were not enough broke saddle horses to go around, many of the cowboys paraded down Main on broncs right out of the bucking horse string.

In the spring of 1958 Mueller, in cooperation with the Yorktown Chamber of Commerce, planned a Western parade to involve the entire community, as well as out-of-town organizations. A two-day rodeo was planned as well. Mueller pledged a pair of handmade boots to the parade&#x27;s best-dressed cowgirl, while the Chamber promised boots to the best-dressed cowboy. Other prizes were pledged from community businesses such as Daniel Dry Gods, Simecek&#x27;s Firestone, J. E. Wolf Sr. and Cole Dry goods.

The April 2, 1958, edition of &quot;The Yorktown News&quot; reported that the parade was &quot;conceived on the spur of the moment, with no time make elaborate plans, appoint committees or work out details….&quot; The newspaper further reported that the success of the venture was due &quot;…to the spontaneous and whole-hearted cooperation of local business men…&quot; In spite of this last-minute planning, on Saturday, March 29 at 3 p.m. Yorktown welcomed a crowd that jammed the downtown sidewalks to see the parade led by the VFW Color Guard. The &quot;Bronc Busters&quot; (the Yorktown High School marching band), led by Mary Gail Kerlick, followed close behind. The parade featured the famous Lone Star Brewing Company Shetland Pony Hitch. This team of matched Shetlands was outfitted with ten gallon hats and six shooters and pulled a miniature covered wagon. A parade highlight was Monroe Woods&#x27; mustang team pulling a frontier wagon carrying an ancient two-seater Chick Sale (outhouse), complete with corn cobs and a Sears catalog. The parade also included colorfully-garbed mounted groups, several floats, new tractors, trucks and automobiles, as well as the four-piece Disintegrated Brotherhood of Near Musicians. With a broom and shovel, Sparky, the rodeo clown, brought up the rear and proclaimed that Yorktown was not a one-horse town indeed.

&quot;The Yorktown News&quot; also reported that most of the western parade watchers &quot;…hightailed it out to Les Mueller&#x27;s Smith Creek Arena…to take in the rodeo...We saw cars bumper to bumper all the way over the hill and as they wended their way into the grounds more and more kept coming...The show got underway about nine o&#x27;clock, and a thriller it was…with mean, ornery broncs and bulls, and fast elusive calves, there were plenty of spills, thrills and chills…as good a show as we&#x27;ve seen anywhere.&quot; Rodeo events included calf roping, bareback bronc riding, bull riding, bull dogging, saddle bronc riding and the ladies&#x27; barrel race. The performance also featured Tab Evans and his trained hog, Pork Chop and his trained dog, Wheeler.

After the success of the first parade and rodeo, the Yorktown Chamber of Commerce continued the celebration annually. In 1962 the Chamber sponsored the first Western Days royal court with Jo Ann Boone crowned as queen. For nearly two decades, M&amp;M Rodeo Company produced a rodeo in conjunction with the Western Days celebration. Throughout the years, the rodeos featured celebrated cowboys such as Bud Humphrey, Glen Dorn, Pat Doyle, Glenn McQueen, Billy Bridges, Cotton Proctor, Sonny Berry and Phil Lyne. Working ranch cowboys from the area who rode as pick-up men included Carl Hoefling, John Horny and Lester Davis. Raymond Stoebner of Victoria served as rodeo announcer while renowned rodeo bull fighters Darrel &quot;Sparky&quot; Sparkman and Billy Willis entertained the crowd with clown antics while protecting the bull riders. Willis died in Waco at age 68.

In 1962 Mueller constructed a new arena on his ranch north of Yorktown on Highway 240 in the small community once known as Little St. Louis and the rodeos were moved from the Smith Creek arena.

In July 1963 Mueller died after a horseback riding accident during a rodeo in Cuero. However, the Western Days rodeos continued with Mueller&#x27;s widow, Cecil Olivia Gilliam Mueller and son Don, managing M&amp;M Rodeo Company. The last rodeo they produced in Yorktown was in 1975.

Today, Western Days continues to draw parade participants from surrounding counties, as well as visitors from across the country. The thousands who come to Yorktown each year enjoy not only the Grand Parade, but live music and entertainment, chili cook-offs, various contests, shopping and the genuine fellowship of the townspeople—the spirit out of which the celebration was born 55 years ago.

<text>Carrizo Springs is the largest city in and the county seat of Dimmit County, Texas, United States. The population was 4,892 at the 2020 census, down from 5,368 at the 2010 census.

The name of the town is derived from the local springs, which were named by the Spanish for the cane grass that once grew around them. It is the oldest town in Dimmit County. Artesian wells in the area are known for their pure, clean water. This water is often exported from Carrizo Springs for use as holy water.

==History==
Carrizo Springs lies along U.S. Route 83, approximately 82 miles northwest of Laredo and 45 miles north of the Mexican border. Route 83 intersects U.S. Route 277 there. The name &quot;Carrizo Springs&quot; derives from similarly named springs in the area; the name is Spanish for a type of grass once common in the area. Founded in 1865 by settlers from Atascosa County, Carrizo Springs is the oldest community in the county.

Carrizo Springs, along with San Antonio, Uvalde, Crystal City, and Corpus Christi, was a major stop on the defunct San Antonio, Uvalde and Gulf Railroad, a Class I line, which operated from 1909 until it was merged into the Missouri Pacific Railroad in 1956.

More recently, Carrizo Springs has become the home of the only olive orchard and oil press in Texas.

===Climate===
Carrizo Springs experiences a hot semi-arid climate with mild winters and hot summers. During the spring season, as well occasionally during the fall season, severe thunderstorms often build on the Serranias Del Burro to the distant west of Carrizo Springs. This is believed to occur due to the uplift of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico which is channeled along the Rio Grande River.

Facilities that previously housed Stratton Oilfield Systems were chosen for a new unaccompanied minor detention site, with an estimated capacity of 1,000 to 1,600 children. Operations are contracted with BCFS Health and Human Services. When the site was previously considered under Stratton Security management, owner and president Dan Stratton assured the area&#x27;s residents that potential residents would not be refugees of the Syrian Civil War or speak Arabic. He emphasized that refugees would be securely kept within the facility and would not interact with or murder area residents. The site opened for one month in 2019 and later reopened in February 2021.

In March 2022, Border Patrol agents declared &quot;no vacancy&quot; and plans to release migrants who cleared background and criminal checks in the city of Carrizo Springs.

<text>Cisco is a city in Eastland County, Texas, United States. The population was 3,883 at the 2020 census, and 3,899 at the time of the 2010 census.

==History==
Cisco, at the intersection of U.S. Highway 183 and Interstate 20 in northwestern Eastland County, traces its history back to 1878 or 1879, when Rev. C. G. Stevens arrived in the area, established a post office and a church, and called the frontier settlement &quot;Red Gap&quot;. About six families were already living nearby, and W. T. Caldwell was running a store a half mile to the west. In 1881, the Houston and Texas Central Railway crossed the Texas and Pacific, which had come through the year before, at a point near Red Gap, and the settlement&#x27;s inhabitants moved their town to the crossing. The date the rails crossed, May 17, 1881, is considered by some to be Cisco&#x27;s &quot;birthday.&quot; Three years later, the town was officially recognized and a new post office granted; the town&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Cisco&quot; for John J. Cisco, a New York financier largely responsible for the building of the Houston and Texas Central. 

Railroads continued to influence the development of Cisco as the Texas and Pacific acquired lots in the town and sold them to immigrants attracted by brochures touting the town as the &quot;Gate City of the West&quot;. Once settlers arrived, agricultural agents employed by the railroad advised them what and when to plant and on occasion provided the seed.

During the 1880s, a Mrs. Haws built and managed the first hotel, and Mrs. J. D. Alexander brought the first &quot;millinery and fancy goods&quot; to town. Following a practice common at the time, religious groups in Cisco met together for prayer meetings in the schoolhouse until they could build separate churches. By 1892, Cisco was a growing community with two newspapers, a bank, and an economy based on trade, ranching, fruit farming, and the limestone, coal, and iron ore available nearby. A broom factory and roller corn and flour mills were among the town&#x27;s 56 businesses.

On April 28, 1893, an F4 tornado struck the center of the business district of Cisco, killing 28 people and destroying or severely damaging every building in town. The city hall, every church and school, and an estimated 500 homes were destroyed.

Conrad Hilton started the Hilton Hotel chain with a single hotel bought in Cisco. Hilton came to Cisco to buy a bank, but the bank cost too much, so he purchased the Mobley Hotel in 1919. The hotel is now a local museum and community center.

During the 1920s, Cisco, like nearby Ranger, Eastland, and Desdemona, was a petroleum boomtown. Although Cisco played a relatively minor role in the Eastland County oil boom of 1919–21, its population grew rapidly at the time, with some estimates as high as 15,000; in the wake of the boom, Cisco adopted a city charter and built a new railroad station that cost $25,000, a value of $310,597.88 in 2015.
In 1925, the first annual meeting of the West Texas Historical Association was held in Cisco. The association, formed in 1924, was then based at Hardin–Simmons University in Abilene, but moved in 1998 to Texas Tech University in Lubbock.

The Santa Claus Bank Robbery occurred in Cisco on December 23, 1927, when Marshall Ratliff and his gang attempted to rob the First National Bank. As of August 2009, the bank site is occupied by an auto parts store, with a Texas Historical Commission sign commemorating the event.

On May 9, 2015, an area just south of the city was hit by a large tornado, destroying several homes, killing one person, and critically injuring one more.

===Largest concrete swimming pool in the world===
Cisco in its early days was plagued with inadequate water supply. In the 1920s, the Williamson Dam was built north of town, resulting in the formation of Lake Cisco. The dam was named after James Milton Williamson, long-time mayor and survivor of the 1893 tornado. At its base was built what was billed as the largest concrete swimming pool in the world. The complex boasted a two-story building with a skating rink upstairs, a zoo, an amusement park with rides, and a park. Bob Wills was only one of the celebrities to entertain there. For decades, it was a major attraction for folks from miles around. The hollow dam was at one time open to the public, but this is no longer the case. 
The pool closed in the 1970s and the vacant skating rink burned a few years later.

About 19.4% of families and 24.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 33.7% of those under age 18 and 25.0% of those age 65 or over.

==History==
The first settlers arrived in the area that is now Rising Star on January 10, 1875. The original seven families were the families of William &quot;Allie&quot; Wylie Smith, G. A., Andrew &quot;Big Andy&quot; Smith, Andrew &quot;Little Andy&quot; Agnew, William &quot;Billy&quot; Agnew, Fletcher Fields, and D. M. (Dave) McKinley. The seven families were all related to each other through the Agnew line.
Large amounts of land were found to be available for purchase in the area, because the state of Texas kept all unappropriated and vacant land after joining the Union 30 years prior. This land belonged to the state, which sold it to finance the construction of the public school system and state universities. The state gave a portion of its land to railroad companies to sell. This encouraged and helped railroad lines to be developed throughout Texas. Because of this, almost all of the land in Eastland County was either school land or railroad land. Settlers could buy railroad land for $3.00 per acre and school land for as low as $1.00 per acre with no down payment and about 20–40 years to pay off the land. Most of these East Texas families purchased land from the railroad companies.

Other families soon began to move into the area and purchase land. Some of the families that settled later were the Anderson, Irby, Roach, Cox, Hull, Leach, Haynes, Wynn, Mayfield, and Swindle families.

No mail routes existed initially in this newly settled frontier, but by about 1880, the community became a stop on a mail route between Cisco and Brownwood. Prior to the establishment of this mail route, the families received mail from Sipe Springs. In 1881, the town sent a petition to the U.S. government asking for a new post office in the area. The community leaders were required to suggest a name for the post office and decided upon the name Star, which was then sent for approval to the Postal Service. The Postal Service sent word back that a post office under the name Star was already located in Texas (in Mills County). The citizens called a meeting to select another name, and after many long hours of deliberation, Little Andy Agnew proposed, &quot;Since we are a rising young community, why don&#x27;t we just call ourselves Rising Star.&quot; The name was agreed to and accepted by the Postal Service. From 1910 through 1911, a spur of the Texas Central line (Katy Railroad) was constructed to the west 40 miles from De Leon to Cross Plains through Rising Star. The Katy abandoned the spur in the 1940s.

==Education==
The town is served by the Rising Star Independent School District and is home to the Rising Star High School Wildcats.

This grass-covered park has several shade trees, covered picnic tables, and various sets of playground equipment. During the winter months the trees are decorated with lights.

At the east end of the park where Antonio Street and Franklin Street intersect there is a flag pole beside a large metal sign which reads &quot;Welcome to Anthony&quot; in red letters facing to the east towards Interstate 10.

==River walk==

Within the municipal boundaries of the town along the Rio Grande on the eastern side is a paved pathway with occasional benches and bridges for public use by bicyclists, joggers, walkers, fishers, bird watchers, runners, and other outdoor enthusiasts. The path lies between the river and levee. The path can be accessed under the Vinton bridge and ends at the New Mexico/Texas state line. The path is closed to all forms of motorized travel, including ATVs.

The area within the levees and the levees themselves are administered by the U.S. Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC). The levee is not part of the public use portion of the path, and persons found on the levee can be charged with trespassing.

Fishing is allowed from the bank with a Texas Parks and Wildlife Department-issued fishing license. Discharging of firearms is prohibited by Anthony municipal code, so hunting is not permitted.

==Leap Year Capital of the World and Worldwide Leap Year Birthday Club==
Every leap year Anthony, Texas, and Anthony, New Mexico, celebrate with an officially sponsored leap year birthday parade and festival.

===Leap Year Capital of the World===
In 1988 local resident Mary Ann Brown, a member of the Anthony Chamber of Commerce and born on leap year day, February 29, proposed that the Anthony Chamber of Commerce host a festival centered on Leap Day.

In February 1988 based on this celebration and because no other place in the world regularly sponsors such an event, the town&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce voted to sponsor Ms. Brown&#x27;s idea of the festival and subsequently declared Anthony, Texas &amp; Anthony, New Mexico to be the joint Leap Year Capitals of the World.

New Mexico Governor Garrey Carruthers and Texas Governor Bill Clements joined in the special proclamation.

United States Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico entered into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; of the United States a request that Congress and the President join in the proclamation. Senator Domenici read it into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; Vol. 134, No. 146, Friday, October 14, 1988, of the 100th Congress.

In January 1996 the Anthony, New Mexico, post office was designated &quot;Leap Year Station&quot; and granted a commemorative postal cancellation. In celebration of the event, the town&#x27;s postmaster will typically appear as &quot;Leap Year William&quot; and distribute candy to parade attendees.

The festival and parade is chaired by the mayor of Anthony, Texas.

===Worldwide Leap Year Birthday Club===
Membership for the Leap Year Birthday Club has grown from zero in 1988 to nearly 300 in 1996 and more than 400 members in 2004. Members include individuals from as far away as Europe and have traveled to Anthony to celebrate.

== Children detention camp ==

In 2019, approximately 250 unaccompanied migrant children were held at a Customs and Border Patrol facility near Clint. According to authorities, children received &quot;hygiene products and food — including new clothing, hand sanitizer, soap and water;&quot; showers were available at least &quot;every three days,&quot; depending on the level of crowding. However, other visitors to the facility, including visitors affiliated with Human Rights Watch, reported &quot;unsanitary, crowded living conditions,&quot; in which children lacked toothbrushes, showers, and soap, and suffered from flu and lice. One pediatric emergency physician described the treatment of children in the facility as reportable child neglect.

According to the Pacific Standard, &quot;Sarah Fabian, the senior attorney in the Department of Justice&#x27;s Office of Immigration Litigation, argued that the sorts of conditions children were experiencing in Customs and Border Protection custody in Clint were perfectly legal,&quot; as &quot;safe and sanitary&quot; in &quot;Reno v. Flores&quot; is a vague requirement which doesn&#x27;t specify toothbrushes, soap, etc.

Educational programs for children in this type of facility were canceled by the Department of Health and Human Services in June 2019.
