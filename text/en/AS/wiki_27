<text>Regent&#x27;s Park College (known colloquially within the university as Regent&#x27;s) is a permanent private hall of the University of Oxford, situated in central Oxford, just off St Giles&#x27;, England, United Kingdom.

Founded in 1810, the college moved to its present site in 1927 and became a licensed hall of the university in 1957. The college now admits both undergraduate and graduate students to take Oxford degrees in a variety of arts, humanities and social science subjects. It is one of the few academic institutions within the University of Oxford to have accepted women as well as men since before the mid-twentieth century, with women attending college since the 1920s. It is affiliated with the Baptist Union of Great Britain.

As of 2022, Regent&#x27;s Park College had a financial endowment of £7.8 million.

==History==
===Origins in London===
Regent&#x27;s Park College traces its roots to the formation of the London Baptist Education Society in 1752. This venture led to the development of the Baptist College, Stepney, a dissenting academy in the East End of London, in 1810. The impetus for the creation of the college arose from the fact that only members of the Church of England were given places at the ancient universities. There were only three students in 1810, but by 1850 the number had risen to 26.

In 1849, Joseph Angus (Principal 1849–1893) became principal at just 33 years old. At the beginning of his time as principal, Angus admitted a small number of lay students to the college. His belief was that it would benefit the ministerial students to have contact with them, as well as bring much-needed finances to the college. After sites in Gordon Square and Primrose Hill were considered, Angus decided on 12 December 1855 to relocate the college to Holford House in the rural environs of Regent&#x27;s Park and to change its name to &quot;Regent&#x27;s Park College&quot;. Holford House was a private dwelling built in the classical Georgian style on Crown land. Students were able to read for university degrees in the arts and law, as well as training for Christian ministry.

After many long ties with University College London, which date back to 1856, the college became an official divinity school of the University of London in 1901. In 1920, George Pearce Gould (1896–1920) passed the role of principal on to Henry Wheeler Robinson, who would hold the post until 1942. Wheeler Robinson was educated at Regent&#x27;s Park College for one session; he then went to Edinburgh University and finally to Mansfield College, Oxford. Wheeler Robinson believed that Oxford was a more congenial setting than London for a college. This belief, coupled with the lure of the advantages of the tutorial system and the fact that Baptists remained the only Free church without a college in one of the ancient universities, led Wheeler Robinson to decide to relocate the college to Oxford.

===Relocation to Oxford===
In 1927, the main portion of the site was purchased and the buildings, including various farm buildings and two wells in Pusey Street, were secured shortly afterwards from St John&#x27;s College. The college appointed T Harold Hughes (1897–1949) as the architect for the site. Hughes was responsible for much extension and restoration work in Oxford, including Exeter College, Hertford College and Corpus Christi College. The first four students arrived in 1928. At this time, many of the classes were held at Mansfield College and other lectures were held at various other colleges. However, as early as 1924, Wheeler Robinson started to promote his plans for a new building scheme on the Oxford site to former students. Between 1935 and 1938, he and E. A. Payne spoke at various meetings and raised £20,000 of the £50,000 needed for the project. The foundation stones for Helwys Hall were laid on 21 July 1938, by representatives from the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland, the Particular Baptist Fund, and the Baptist Missionary Society. Stones were also laid in memory of Angus and Gould, former principals of the college.

The Main Block, consisting of 16 study bedrooms, Helwys Hall, the College Library, the Senior Common Room and part of the building on Pusey Street, were constructed from 1938 to 1940. However, the outbreak of the Second World War along with a lack of funds meant that the ambitious plans for the completion of the quadrangle had to be put on hold.

In 1957, Regent&#x27;s Park College became a permanent private hall of the University of Oxford. During this period, the college once again started to accept non-ministerial undergraduates and new buildings on Pusey Street were erected to accommodate the college&#x27;s growing size, thus completing the quadrangle. The Balding student accommodation block was built in 1960, and a large window was fitted in a three-storey high wall overlooking Balding Quadrangle behind the main quadrangle – allegedly the largest single pane of glass in Europe. In 1977, the Angus student accommodation block was built thus providing Balding Quadrangle with an extra side. Extra accommodation was built in Wheeler Robinson House in 1988. When Greyfriars closed in 2008 (having been a permanent private hall since 1958), the remaining 30 students joined Regent&#x27;s Park College. When another permanent private hall, St Benet&#x27;s Hall, closed in September 2022, 29 of St Benet&#x27;s students joined Regent&#x27;s. 

==Buildings==

Regent&#x27;s Park College is located just off St Giles&#x27; in the heart of Oxford, near St Cross College and St John&#x27;s College. The site is based around a large neoclassical quadrangle (as seen in the adjacent picture). The quadrangle is well known for the extensive Virginia creeper which covers most of the buildings. On the south side of the quad are the college entrance and lodge. On the west side is the Hall, with two Ionic columns flanking the main entrance to the room. The names &quot;Thomas Helwys&quot; and &quot;William Carey&quot; are carved on either side of the glass door leading into the Hall. Thomas Helwys was a religious refugee in Holland and returned to England to start the first Baptist church. William Carey was a missionary to India and inspired the foundation of the Baptist Missionary Society in 1792.

The college also owns seventeenth- and eighteenth-century houses which face out onto St. Giles&#x27; as well as more recent developments, such as Wheeler Robinson House, which is used for third-year accommodation, and Gould House and Angus House, both of which are used either for undergraduates or tutors. All undergraduate accommodation is on-site, or less than a three-minute walk away from the main college buildings. The college also makes use of some central University accommodation provisions for postgraduates, notably the Castle Mill development in North Oxford and some houses in Wellington Square. 

===Helwys Hall===

Helwys Hall is home to a series of portraits which, taken together, present a brief history of the college. Most of the former principals&#x27; portraits are displayed including a recent portrait of Professor Paul Fiddes and Dr. Robert Ellis. There are also portraits of Joshua Marshman, Hannah Marshman, William Carey, and Willam Ward who were all missionaries to India and Andrew Fuller who was a missionary and first secretary of the Baptist Missionary Society. Helwys Hall was completely renovated in 2009 with a gift to the college&#x27;s Annual Fund from an anonymous donor.

===Common Rooms===
The Junior Common Room 

The JCR is adorned with pictures of Regent&#x27;s sports teams. The room also has a JCR presidents&#x27; board with the name of every JCR president until Rosie Marie Walsh (2021) and a board recording all Regent&#x27;s students who have received a Blue from the university. 

The Middle Common Room 

The MCR is the college&#x27;s Postgraduate community. Hosting a variety of Ministerial, Mature Undergraduate, Master&#x27;s, Doctoral and Part-time Students.

The Senior Common Room 

The SCR, which is used by academic and administrative staff, was provided by a gift from the nieces and nephews of George Pearce Gould (principal 1896–1920). A portrait of Gould hangs over an Adams brothers&#x27; mantelpiece. Facing Gould is a portrait of William Kiffin which dates back to 1667.

===Libraries===
====The College Library====
The College Library is on the third floor of the college above Helwys Hall and houses many key works relating to theology, as well as many works on history, geography and politics. It contains graduate study rooms as well as a number of computers.

In the library, there is a semi-circular window with sixteen panels, on which is etched a map of the world with many interesting symbols and emblems. The window came from the Glasgow Empire Exhibition of 1937 and is a fine example of modern glasswork. The library contains portraits of both William Carey and John Bunyan, and outside it hangs a portrait of Henry Havelock.

====Angus Library and Archive====
The Angus Library and Archive is a scholarship library holding volumes and documents on Baptist history and culture. The core of the collection was left to the college by Joseph Angus who was principal from 1849 to 1893. The Angus now comprises over 70,000 printed books, pamphlets, journals, church and association records, church histories, manuscript letters and other artefacts from the late fifteenth century to the present day. The collection relates to the life and history of Baptists in Britain and the wider world. There is a considerable amount of material from non-Baptist sources relating to issues and controversies in which Baptists were involved.

The Angus Library and Archive are used by scholars researching Baptist history, the history of dissent in the UK, and the social history of foreign missions and linguistics. It is also used by members of the public to research family and local history.

==Academics==
Students are admitted and matriculated according to the same admissions procedures as the other colleges and halls of the University of Oxford. The college specializes in the arts, humanities and theology. It is affiliated with the Baptist Union of Great Britain.

==Student life==
There are sports teams in football, rowing, netball and basketball as well as opportunities to play other sports for other Oxford colleges. 

The Junior Common Room also provides arts activities, such as an annual play and pantomime, as well as several social societies.

Each summer, the college hosts a themed ball named The Final Fling. During Trinity Term, croquets and Pimms are enjoyed on the quad, which is also occupied by the college tortoise. The college&#x27;s first tortoise, Emmanuelle, won the Corpus Christi Tortoise Fair twice, as well as appeared on Blue Peter.

On 3 October 2022, Emanuelle died, after most recently celebrating her supposed 119th birthday (although her age was more likely between 80 and 100 years old). She was immortalised in the college chapel&#x27;s new stained glass window. On 27 May 2023, the college welcomed a new young tortoise, Truffle.

==Traditions==
===Motto===
The college motto is: . It is taken from : &quot;Test all things; hold fast to that which is good&quot; (A.V.)

===Grace and Hall===

The college grace is recited in the vernacular by the principal and runs as follows: &quot;For the gifts of your grace and the community of this college, we praise your name, O God. Amen.&quot; At the end of the Formal Hall, the Senior Common Room depart after the principal has said the words &quot;The grace and peace of God be with us all. Amen&quot;.

In the early days of the college at Oxford, there was a Latin grace which was thought to be composed by Aubrey Argyle:
. This was allegedly swiftly dropped as Henry Wheeler Robinson, then principal, observed a strict &#x27;no-Latin&#x27; policy in Hall – in the old days, offenders were thrown into a bath of cold water. It has also traditionally been the case that there is no Loyal Toast at college dinners. Around the turn of the millennium, the dean even remonstrated with guests from a different college to prevent the toast from being proposed.

Unlike many other Oxford colleges, the same menu is served to all members of the college and there is no High Table apart from in formal halls. It also observes a tradition that grace is said at every meal, with students and dons alike standing behind their chairs until it has been said.

===Valediction===

The principal ceremonial occasion in the college year is the Service of Valediction, which takes place on the afternoon of the last day of Full Term in Trinity (always a Saturday). The most important part of the ceremony is the signing of the register by members of the Junior and Middle Common Rooms whose periods of study have come to an end. This is different from the practice at other colleges that maintain a register (now a minority of colleges), where the signing takes place at the beginning of a student&#x27;s course.

===Other traditions===

A tradition from the nineteenth century, which is now somewhat forgotten (despite having been common even in the early years of the twenty-first century) was that first-year students of the college are called &quot;monarchs&quot; and their elder colleagues are known as &quot;regents&quot;. This was to remind older students that they had a duty of care to the younger members, much as a regent has a duty of care to an infirm monarch (the metaphor appears to have been drawn from the regency of George IV, after whom Regent&#x27;s Park in London, the college&#x27;s namesake, is named).

Ernest A. Payne, a former alumnus of the college who attended Regent&#x27;s during its move to Oxford in the 1920s, mentions in passing during a lecture delivered in the 1970s that there was at one time a college song, which was sung as the students vacated the premises in Regent&#x27;s Park. The chorus of the song was cited by Payne to have been as follows: 
&lt;poem&gt;&quot;So we raise, as time goes by,&quot;
&quot;Our Marseillaise, our battle-cry,&quot;
&quot;Forward Regent&#x27;s!&quot;&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>St Anne&#x27;s College is a constituent college of the University of Oxford in England. It was founded in 1879 and gained full college status in 1959. Originally a women&#x27;s college, it has admitted men since 1979. It has some 450 undergraduate and 200 graduate students and retains an original aim of allowing women of any financial background to study at Oxford. It still has a student base with a higher than average proportion of female students. The college stands between Woodstock and Banbury roads, next to the University Parks. 
In April 2017, Helen King, a retired Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner, took over as Principal from Tim Gardam. Former members include Danny Alexander, Edwina Currie, Ruth Deech, Helen Fielding, William MacAskill, Amanda Pritchard, Simon Rattle, Tina Brown, Mr Hudson and Victor Ubogu.

==History==
===Society of Oxford Home-Students (1879–1942)===
What is now St Anne&#x27;s College began as part of the Association for the Education of Women (AEW), the first institution in Oxford with that aim. It then became the Society of Oxford Home-Students. Unlike other women&#x27;s associations, the society had no fixed site, instead offering lodgings in houses spread across Oxford. This allowed students of various financial backgrounds to study at Oxford, as the cost of accommodation in women&#x27;s halls was often prohibitive. In the early 20th century, the college housed some students in hostels managed by Catholic and Anglican nuns. Springfield, St Mary was managed by Anglican nuns of the Community of St Mary the Virgin in houses in Banbury Road where they, and other hostels, &quot;had to exercise control over their students according to the rules of the college&quot;. Other hostels were run by Catholic nuns: the Society of the Sacred Heart in Norham Gardens, the Sisters of Notre Dame in Woodstock Road and the Society of the Holy Child Jesus at Cherwell Edge in St Cross Road. Springfield St Mary was advertised in 1985 in &quot;Country Life&quot; Magazine as being for sale. 

From 1898 till 1906, the Society of Home Students saw some of its members in residence at Wychwood School, then situated at 77 Banbury Road. They were supervised by Miss Margaret Lee who in 1913, was appointed Tutor to the Oxford Home Students, holding this position until she retired in 1936. Early students of the college included the great-great aunt of Catherine, Princess of Wales. Anglican nun and VAD nurse Gertrude Middleton (1876–1942) lived in college accommodation at Banbury Road having commenced her studies at Oxford in 1900. Her sister Margaret Middleton (1880–1900) was due to study at Oxford alongside her but drowned earlier that year. 

The first woman Hon. Lady Secretary of the Association for the Education of Women was Charlotte Green whose husband T.H. Green had also acted as secretary to the association in the 1870s. Her husband having died, Charlotte, a social reformer, resolved to &quot;do what my Husband wanted me to do — to make friends with working people and help them if I could that way&quot;. An emphasis on social work saw the Society of Home-Students work with the Lady Margaret Hall Settlement; the Principal of the Society from 1940 to 1953, Eleanor Plumer, had previously been Warden of the Mary Ward Settlement (1923-1927). The Women&#x27;s University Settlement, Blackfriars Road was partly the result of T.H. Green&#x27;s &quot;inspiring influence&quot;.

In 1910, the Society of Oxford Home-Students, with the other women&#x27;s societies, was recognised by the university. In 1912, the society acquired its first tutors, in German, History and English Literature. In the 1920s, the principals of the women&#x27;s societies became the first women to receive degrees from the university. The society in the early 1930s still had no centralised site, but within a few years the current location was chosen and by 1937 construction of Hartland House was underway.

===St Anne&#x27;s Society (1942–1952)===
In 1942, the Society of Oxford Home-Students was renamed the St Anne&#x27;s Society and given its coat of arms by Eleanor Plumer (Principal, 1940–1953). The name St Anne&#x27;s was chosen as historically, there was a chapel of Saint Anne at the University Church of St Mary the Virgin where, from the college&#x27;s earliest days, the whole student body would gather for termly services.

===St Anne&#x27;s College (1952 onwards)===
In 1952, the St Anne&#x27;s Society acquired a royal charter as St Anne&#x27;s College and in 1959 full college status along with the other women&#x27;s colleges. The Principal at the time, Mary Ogilvie, pressed for a transition from many disparate dining rooms to a common building. This led to the construction of the dining hall completed in 1959 and visited by Queen Elizabeth II in 1960. Meanwhile student numbers grew to nearly 300, which called for more accommodation and led to the construction of the Wolfson and Rayne buildings in 1964 and 1968. In 1977, the decision was made to become coeducational, with the first male undergraduates matriculating in 1979.

Since then, St Anne&#x27;s has continued to use female words and pronouns, such as &quot;alumnae&quot; to refer to current and former students. The college explains this: &quot;On 17 June 1979, in the nervous time when the first male Fellows had been elected, and the first male students admitted though they had not yet arrived, a note from the Dean to Governing Body asks hesitantly &#x27;Would Governing Body wish &quot;he&quot; (or &quot;he/she&quot;) to be substituted for &quot;she&quot; throughout the College Regulations?&#x27; Eventually the question was answered (or perhaps avoided) by a carefully worded statement that remains in the preamble to our Regulations: &#x27;words importing the feminine gender shall include the masculine and vice versa, where the construction so permits and the Regulations do not otherwise expressly provide.&#x27;&quot;

In 2023, work began on the full reconstruction of the Bevington Road accommodation blocks, in order to make them more suitable for future generations of students.

===&quot;The Ship&quot;===
The annual magazine for former college members is called &quot;The Ship&quot;. When still the Society of Oxford Home-Students, the college had its first common room in Ship Street, central Oxford. &quot;The Ship&quot; started up in about 1910; by the college centenary in 1979 there had been 69 issues. It marked its centenary issue of 2010/2011 with anniversary content.

==Location and buildings==
===Grounds===

The college grounds are bounded by Woodstock Road to the west, Banbury Road to the east, and Bevington Road to the north. These grounds house all of the college&#x27;s administrative and academic buildings, undergraduate accommodation, as well as the hall, which is among the largest in Oxford. The College formerly owned a number of houses throughout Oxford used for undergraduate accommodation, some of which used to be boarding houses of the &quot;Society of Oxford Home-Students.&quot; Many of these properties were sold off to fund the building of the Ruth Deech Building, completed in 2005.

===Accommodation===
St Anne&#x27;s can accommodate undergraduates on the college site for three years of study. Undergraduates at St Anne&#x27;s are housed in 14 Victorian houses owned by the college and four purpose-built accommodation blocks. The college also supplies accommodation for some of its graduate students. All undergraduates pay the same amount for their rooms, and every student has access to a communal kitchen in their building.

====Victorian houses====
The college uses 1–10 Bevington Road (also known colloquially as &quot;the Bevs&quot;), 58/60 Woodstock Road, and 39/41 Banbury Road (also known as &quot;Above the Bar&quot;) as undergraduate accommodation, typically for freshers. The junior (undergraduate) post room is located in 10 Bevington Road, the college laundry in 58/60 Woodstock Road, and the college bar, including a pool room, in 39/41 Banbury Road. Five additional Victorian houses (27/29 and 37 Banbury Road and 48/50 Woodstock Road) hold teaching rooms, seminar rooms, music practice rooms, and college offices. In July 2023, the Bevington Road accommodation began a two-year renovation project. 

====Rayne and Wolfson Buildings====

The Rayne and Wolfson Buildings were built in 1964 and are Grade II Listed Buildings virtually identical in design. They house administrative offices on the ground floor and student rooms.

====Claire Palley Building====
The Claire Palley Building, completed in 1992 and named after Claire Palley (Principal 1984–1991), was the first accommodation block to have en-suite rooms. It also houses the Mary Ogilvie Lecture Theatre.

====Trenaman House====

Trenaman House, built in 1995, holds student rooms and communal college facilities, including the gym, and since 2008, St Anne&#x27;s Coffee Shop (STACS). It was named after Nancy Trenaman, sixth Principal of the college (1966–1984).

====Ruth Deech Building====

The Ruth Deech Building, named after the Principal in 1991–2004, was completed in 2005. The lower ground floor has the Tsuzuki lecture theatre, seminar rooms and dining facilities and a new Porter&#x27;s Lodge on the upper ground floor with 110 en-suite student rooms. One notable feature is a glass lift, the only part of the building to exceed the roof line. The building was awarded the 2007 David Steel sustainable building award by Oxford City Council.

====Robert Saunders House====
Robert Saunders House, built in 1996, provides 80 rooms for graduate students in Summertown. It was named after a former bursar of the college, who did much to improve its finances.

====Eleanor Plumer House====
Eleanor Plumer House (known until 2008 as 35 Banbury Road) is named after Eleanor Plumer (Principal 1940–1953). It houses the Middle Common Room; facilities include a study area, computer room and kitchen. It also houses some graduate students.

Hartland House
Hartland House, designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, was the first purpose-built college building, finished in 1937 with another wing added in 1973. It houses the old library, the junior and senior common rooms and administrative offices. It features the college crest above the main entrance and engravings of beavers, the college mascot.

===Dining Hall===
The Dining Hall, built in 1959, is among the largest in Oxford with a capacity of 300. Three meals are served daily in hall apart from weekends, when only brunch is served. It is also used for college collections (internal college exams) and on occasion college &#x27;bops&#x27; (costume parties).

===Library===
The college library has over 100,000 volumes, making it one of the largest in Oxford. It is split between the original library in Hartland House and the Tim Gardam building, which opened officially in 2017.
The original college library in Hartland House now houses the law, arts, and humanities collections (Dewey Decimal shelfmarks 340–349 and 700–999).

The new library and academic centre was named after Tim Gardam (principal 2004–2016) and completed in 2016. It is on the site of the former Founders&#x27; Gatehouse, which was built in 1966 and was the college lodge until 2005. It covers the area previously taken by the 54 Woodstock Road cottage. The centre provides various study and seminar spaces and 1,500 metres of bookshelves for the college&#x27;s growing book collection. The plans by Fletcher Priest Architects were inspired by Oxford&#x27;s historic buildings.

The Tim Gardam Building also features two gardens; a roof garden overlooking the dining hall, and a sunken courtyard accessible through the basement.

==Traditions==
The college has relatively few traditions and is rare amongst Oxford colleges in not having a chapel, due to its secular outlook. Formal hall is typically held fortnightly. Gowns are not usually worn except for official university occasions such as matriculation and certain college feasts. The college mascot has been a beaver since 1913.

===College grace===
The college grace was composed by former classics tutor and founding fellow Margaret Hubbard. It involves the Principal reciting the Latin words &quot;Quas decet, (Deo) gratias agamus. Amen.&quot; (&quot;For what we have received, we give thanks (to God). Amen.&quot;) The inclusion of &quot;Deo&quot; (to God) depends on whether the grace is religious or secular in nature.

===Room ballot===
The college selects accommodation using a room ballot, with the exception of the first years. Those entering their fourth year select their rooms on the first day, followed by third-year rooms on the second day, and second-year rooms on the third and final day. Students are allocated a number within their year denoting their position in the ballot. In first year, this allocation is based on the quality of their previous year&#x27;s accommodation. In second year, the JCR President, VP and Domestic Affairs Officer pull student numbers from a hat. Students would queue and rooms are allocated one by one. Rooms allocated are crossed off a large board listing all available rooms. Following the Covid-19 pandemic, the room ballot now occurs online, with a spreadsheet denoting available rooms shared with students. There is then a period of one week after the ballot where students can mutually agree on swaps. Unlike many colleges, JCR and MCR committee members receive no advantage in the room ballot for their position.

==Sport and societies==

The college has teams for all major sports and competes in inter-collegiate &quot;Cuppers&quot; tournaments. Fixtures are either played in the neighbouring University Parks, or in the college playing fields on Woodstock Road.

St Anne&#x27;s College Boat Club (SABC) organises the college&#x27;s involvement in inter-college rowing events, and the college boathouse, situated on the River Isis in Christ Church Meadow is shared with St Hugh&#x27;s and Wadham colleges. The college has a joint rugby team with St John&#x27;s College, which won Cuppers in 2014. The women&#x27;s football team, which is also joint with St John&#x27;s, was victorious in Cuppers in 2020. Meanwhile, the St Anne&#x27;s men&#x27;s football team (known as the Mint Green Army) won the Hassan&#x27;s Cup plate tournament in 2018.

<text>St Antony&#x27;s College is a constituent college of the University of Oxford in England. Founded in 1950 as the result of the gift of French merchant Sir Antonin Besse of Aden, St Antony&#x27;s specialises in international relations, economics, politics, and area studies relative to Europe, Russia, former Soviet states, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, China, and South and South East Asia.

The college is located in North Oxford, with Woodstock Road to the west, Bevington Road to the south and Winchester Road to the east. St Antony&#x27;s had a financial endowment of £55.1m as of 2021. Formerly a men&#x27;s college, it has been coeducational since 1962.

==History==
St Antony&#x27;s was founded in 1950 as the result of the gift of Sir Antonin Besse of Aden, a merchant of French descent.

In 1947, Besse was considering giving around £2 million to the University of Oxford to found a new college. Ultimately, on the advice of his solicitor, R Clyde, who had attended New College, Besse decided to go ahead with the plan and permitted Clyde to approach the university with the offer. The university was initially unreceptive to the offer, and recommended that Besse instead devote his funds to improving the finances of some of the poorer existing colleges. Eventually Besse acquiesced, contributing a total of £250,000 in varied amounts to the following colleges: Keble, Worcester, St Peter&#x27;s, Wadham, Exeter, Pembroke, Lincoln and St Edmund Hall. After this large contribution, the university decided to reconsider Besse&#x27;s offer to help found a new college and, recognising the need to provide for the growing number of postgraduate students coming to Oxford, gave the venture their blessing; and in 1948, Besse signed a deed of trust appointing the college&#x27;s first trustees.
The attention of the university then turned to providing the new college, by then called St Antony&#x27;s, with a permanent home. Ripon Hall was initially considered as a good option for a building in which to house the college, but its owners refused to sell, forcing the university to continue its search for premises. They looked at several properties in quick succession, including Youlbury, the Wytham Abbey estate, and Manchester College, which was known to be in financial difficulties and which might thus consider the sale of its 19th-century Mansfield Road buildings. None of these options proved tenable, and the college began to look elsewhere. It is said that Besse became very frustrated with the university and its apparent lack of interest in his project at this point, and almost gave up any hope of its completion. However the college finally acquired its current premises at 62 Woodstock Road in 1950.

The College first admitted students in Michaelmas Term 1950 and received its Royal Charter in 1953. A supplementary charter was granted in 1962 to allow the college to admit women as well as men, and in 1963 the College became a full member of the University of Oxford. By 1952 the number of students at St Antony&#x27;s had increased to 27 and by the end of the decade that number had risen to 260, amongst whom 34 different nationalities were represented. The college initially struggled due to a lack of funding, and in the late 1960s serious consideration was given to uniting St Antony&#x27;s with All Souls College when All Souls announced its intention to take a more active role in the education of graduate students. The plan did not come to fruition; All Souls rejected the proposed federal nature of the combined institution, saying they would consider nothing less than a full merger, a proposal which St Antony&#x27;s governing body did not support. St Antony&#x27;s lack of funds was partly solved under the wardenship of William Deakin, who devoted himself to college fund-raising and secured a number of generous loans from the Ford and Volkswagen foundations. Financial difficulties led to the cancellation of a number of proposed physical developments at its site on Woodstock Road. Not until the 1990s was it feasible for the college to embark upon a new building programme; however, since then St Antony&#x27;s has continued to expand and open new specialist centres for the pursuit of area studies. The college is now recognised as one of the world&#x27;s foremost centres for such studies. and houses centres for the study of Africa, Asia, Europe, Japan, Latin America, the Middle East and Russia and Eurasia.
From the beginning Besse had expressed his hope that the new college, which he intended to open to men &quot;irrespective of origin, race or creed&quot;, would prove instrumental in improving international cooperation and intercultural understanding. The college soon announced its primary role as such: &quot;to be a centre of advanced study and research in the fields of modern international history, philosophy, economics and politics and to provide an international centre within the University where graduate students from all over the world can live and work together in close contact with senior members of the University who are specialists in their fields&quot;. The college is still true to its founding principle, remaining one of the most international colleges of the university, and home to many of Oxford&#x27;s region-specific study departments. This latter feature, combined with the wardenship of William Deakin and St Antony&#x27;s reputation as a key centre for the study of Soviet affairs during the Cold War, led to rumours of links between the college and the British intelligence services; the author Leslie Woodhead wrote to this effect, describing the college as &quot;a fitting gathering place for old spooks&quot;. St Antony&#x27;s became notorious in both the British and Russian press as a &quot;spy college.&quot; The character of Roy Bland from John le Carré&#x27;s Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is said to have been a top specialist in Soviet satellite states educated at St Antony&#x27;s, from where he was recruited by George Smiley.
The official annals of the university state that St Antony&#x27;s was one of four colleges, along with All Souls, Nuffield and Christ Church, which made a concerted effort to establish external links. In St Antony&#x27;s case, the college established wide-ranging connections with diplomats and foreign visitors; this is further commented on as having made the college &quot;perhaps more significant than any other single development in Oxford&#x27;s adjustment to the contemporary international academic environment&quot;.

The college&#x27;s name alludes to its founder, whose name, Antonin Besse, is derived from the same linguistic root. For a long time it was not made clear whether Anthony the Great or Anthony of Padua was the intended namesake. The matter was finally settled in 1961, when the college finally deemed Anthony the Great to be more the appropriate choice, due to his links to one of the college&#x27;s prime areas of specialisation - the Middle and Near East. Despite this, the college&#x27;s banner is flown each year on both saints&#x27; days as a matter of tradition, and a statue of the &quot;wrong&quot; Anthony, Anthony of Padua (distinguished by his holding of the Christ child), stands in the college&#x27;s Hilda Besse Building.

==Buildings and grounds==
===Main building===

The college&#x27;s main building was built in the early Victorian era for the Society of the Holy and Undivided Trinity at the behest of Marian Rebecca Hughes, the first woman to take monastic vows within the Church of England since the reformation. The order commissioned Charles Buckeridge, a local architect of some renown, to design the convent buildings. After initially proposing a circular design based on the symbolism of the holy trinity, Buckeridge took to a more traditional approach and drew up the plans for what is now St Antony&#x27;s main building some time before 1865. Whilst initially there were plans to enlarge the convent with a northerly extension, for which place was made in the building&#x27;s design, further building never took place. The convent finally opened in November 1868.

The total cost of the initial build was eight thousand pounds, a considerable sum at that time. It is said that upon first seeing the convent&#x27;s new premises, the architect William Butterfield commented that it was the &#x27;best modern building in Oxford after my college&#x27;, by which he meant Keble. St Antony&#x27;s acquired the former convent in 1950 after it had been vacated by the convent and Halifax House, which had occupied the premises in the immediate post war period. The building&#x27;s chapel, which was never consecrated and now houses the college library, was built in the years 1891–1894 to Buckeridge&#x27;s original design. The three panel paintings round the apse of the former chapel are by Charles Edgar Buckeridge. The main building&#x27;s undercroft, now the Gulbenkian Reading Room, was initially used by the nuns as a refectory, a role it continued to play until the completion of the Hilda Besse building in 1970.

===1960s: The Hilda Besse Building===

After a number of ambitious schemes, one of which had been designed by Oscar Niemeyer, to enlarge the college in the 1960s fell through due to lack of funds, the college decided to concentrate its efforts in providing for the construction of a small extension and acquisition of neighbouring properties. The Hilda Besse Building (then known as New Building) was opened in 1970; this building still serves its original purpose in housing the college&#x27;s dining hall, graduate common room, and buttery (college bar), as well as ancillary meeting rooms. The next major expansion of the college came in 1993 with the completion of a new building to house the Nissan Institute for Japanese Studies and the Bodleian Japanese Library, whilst additional accommodation was not supplied until the Founder&#x27;s Building was opened to mark the millennium in the year 2000. The Wahba Dining Hall, the main dining hall for the college located on the first floor of the Hilda Besse Building, was also used as a filming location for &quot;The Amateur&quot;, a 2025 spy film starring Rami Malek.

===2000s: The Gateway Buildings===
In the early 21st century not much development took place until completion of the college&#x27;s new Gateway Buildings in 2013, which provide a new main entrance to the college and form the east, and final, side of the college&#x27;s first quadrangle. The funding for this was gained in part by Foulath Hadid who, for his outstanding services to the college, was elected to an Honorary Fellowship in 2004, and the Hadid Room, the college&#x27;s meeting room, was named in his honour.

===The Investcorp Building===

As part of its ongoing development programme, St Antony&#x27;s commissioned the construction of a new centre for Middle Eastern Studies. The Middle East Centre, or Investcorp Building, was designed by the Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid; it broke ground on 30 January 2013 and was opened as the Investcorp Building on 26 May 2015. The Guardian described it as a &quot;writhing metallic slug that does its best to maul the two historic buildings between which its contorted body is slung&quot;. It was awarded the Sir Hugh Casson Award in 2015 for the worst new building of the year.

==Student life and study==
St Antony&#x27;s College has some 450 students from over 66 nationalities; about half of the students have a first language other than English. Student interests are represented by an elected body, the Graduate Common Room (GCR) Executive, which is elected on an annual basis at the end of Michaelmas Term.

Most college accommodation is located on site, with around 104 en-suite bedrooms provided in the Gateway and Founder&#x27;s buildings. Further rooms are to be found in converted Victorian houses both on site or very close by.

The college is host to the St Antony&#x27;s Late Bar, located on the ground floor of the award-winning Hilda Besse building and serving students throughout the academic year. In addition to operating as a bar, it hosts numerous themed bops, culture/region/country nights, live music events (guest concerts, open-mic nights, Battle of the Bands), welfare/charity functions, various tastings and launch parties, among others. Recurring events include Halloqueen, USA Night, Latin Bop, Balkan Night, and the thrice-annual Drink the Bar Dry.

===Libraries and publications===

The Old Main Building - the former Holy Trinity Convent which was built in the 1860s - houses the College Library (including the Gulbenkian Reading Room) and the Russian and Eurasian Studies Centre Library. The College Library keeps general collections in modern history, politics, international relations and economics, collections on Europe, Asia, and the non-Slavonic collections on Russia and the former Soviet Union. It holds over 50,000 volumes and back issues of over 300 journal titles. It also houses some 20th-century archive collections, including the Wheeler-Bennett papers. St Antony&#x27;s is associated with the Oxford Libraries Information System (OLIS), and has been a contributor to the university&#x27;s online union library catalogue since 1990.
The other libraries on the College site are the Middle East Centre Library, the Bodleian Latin American Centre Library, the Bodleian Japanese Library and the Russian and Eurasian Studies Centre Library, the last of which was refurbished in 2008–2009 as part of the college&#x27;s rolling construction and rejuvenation program. The college also holds an extensive collection of archival material relating to the Middle East at the Middle East Centre Archive, the premises of which were greatly expanded with the completion of Zaha Hadid&#x27;s Softbridge building in mid-2014. The area studies libraries on site are unique within the university and thus generally open to all its students, regardless of college affiliation; they typically hold a wide collection of primary language sources and further Anglophone texts - an abundance of specialist material and unique expertise which prompted Leslie Woodhead to comment as follows:
The college&#x27;s Graduate Common Room has, since 2005, published a biannual academic journal entitled the &quot;St Antony&#x27;s International Review&quot;, which is more commonly known by its acronym - STAIR. The journal represents a medium through which aspiring young academics can publish their work alongside their established policy-makers and their peers. Furthermore, the college publishes a termly newsletter, the &quot;Antonian&quot;, and a college record - an annual report on college affairs.

===Sports and societies===

This is further fostered by the communal social life of the college. St. Antony&#x27;s College Boat Club has multiple boats in Oxford&#x27;s regattas, and has seen success in recent years.
The football club is also popular amongst students. Other societies include the gardening club.

===Rankings===
As a postgraduate only college, St Antony&#x27;s does not appear in the university&#x27;s annual Norrington Table.

==Traditions and attributes==
St Antony&#x27;s is a largely informal college, mandating the wearing of academic dress (sub fusc) only for the university&#x27;s matriculation and graduation ceremonies. The college does not maintain a permanent high table, instead choosing to serve high table meals on a number of occasions each week for the college&#x27;s fellows and visiting academics. Students often attend high table at the invitation of their supervisors. As a graduate college, St Antony&#x27;s students play an important role in the day-to-day business of running the college through their elected body of representatives - the Graduate Common Room or GCR.

===Coat of arms===
The college&#x27;s arms were granted in 1952, and reflect the college&#x27;s namesake: Anthony the Great of Egypt. The red represents the Red Sea, whilst the gold was chosen to reflect desert sands. The stars (heraldically known as &quot;mullets&quot;) were taken from the founder&#x27;s trade mark, whilst the T-shaped elements are traditional crosses of St Antony. The heraldic blazon for these arms is as follows:
&quot;Or on a chevron between three tau crosses gules as many pierced mullets of the field.&quot;
The college&#x27;s motto &#x27;plus est en vous&#x27; is sometimes added in complement to its arms: they are typically placed upon a scroll beneath the escutcheon (shield); this version of the arms is most commonly found on the cover of St Antony&#x27;s Papers issues. The motto itself can be translated literally as &quot;there is more in you&quot;, although it is commonly taken to imply the following English expression: &quot;There is more to you than meets the eye&quot;.

===Grace===
St Antony&#x27;s is one of nine colleges at the university to employ the &#x27;two-word&#x27; Latin grace. This is statistically the most popular form of grace said at hall in Oxford and also in Cambridge, where it is used by five colleges. The grace is read out in two parts at the college&#x27;s formal meals, which take place thrice each term. The first half of the grace or &quot;ante cibum&quot; is said before the start of the meal and the second, the &quot;post cibum&quot;, once the meal has ended. It is read as follows:
&quot;Benedictus benedicat&quot; - &quot;May the Blessed One give a blessing&quot;

&quot;Benedicto benedicatur&quot; - &quot;Let praise be given to the Blessed One&quot;
The grace is said in keeping with tradition. However, unlike at most Oxford colleges, St Antony&#x27;s does not require its students to stand and acknowledge the saying of grace. The second half of the grace or &quot;post cibum&quot; can also be translated (based on the ablative case rather than the dative case) as &quot;Let a blessing be given by the Blessed One&quot;.

==People associated with St Antony&#x27;s==
===Wardens===
The first Warden of the college was Sir William Deakin (1950–1968), a young Oxford academic who in the Second World War became an adventurous soldier and aide to Winston Churchill. He won Antonin Besse&#x27;s confidence and played the key role in turning his vision into the centre of excellence that St Antony&#x27;s has become. Sir Raymond Carr (1968–1987), a distinguished historian of Spain, expanded the college and its regional coverage and opened its doors to visiting scholars from all over the world.

Sir Ralf Dahrendorf (later Lord Dahrendorf) (1987–1997) came to St Antony&#x27;s after a distinguished career as a social theorist and politician in Germany, a European Commissioner and Director of the London School of Economics. He further enlarged the college and developed its role as a source of policy advice. The previous Warden, Sir Marrack Goulding (1997–2006), served in the British Diplomatic Service for 26 years before becoming an Under Secretary-General at the United Nations. His appointment underlined the international nature of the college and its links with government and business. Following the retirement of the fifth Warden of the College Margaret MacMillan in October 2017, social anthropologist Roger Goodman was elected Warden, having previously served in an acting capacity between 2006 and 2007.

<text>St Benet&#x27;s Hall (known colloquially as Benet&#x27;s) was a permanent private hall (PPH) of the University of Oxford, originally a Roman Catholic religious house of studies. It closed in 2022. The principal building was located at the northern end of St Giles&#x27; on its western side, close to the junction with Woodstock Road, Oxford.

==History==
===Benedictine antecedents===
Benedictine monks had studied at Oxford since at least 1281, when Gloucester Abbey founded Gloucester College. The area today known as Gloucester Green was named after this college. In 1291, Durham Abbey founded Durham College, and in 1362, Christ Church Priory in Canterbury founded Canterbury College. All three Benedictine houses of study were closed between 1536 and 1545, during the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII. Gloucester College was eventually re-founded as Worcester College. Durham College was re-founded as Trinity College, but the original college&#x27;s name is preserved in Trinity&#x27;s Durham Quadrangle. Canterbury College&#x27;s property was acquired by Christ Church. Until the establishment of St Benet&#x27;s Hall in 1897, the Benedictines had been absent from the university for over 350 years.

St Benet&#x27;s Hall was not a re-foundation of any of the former Benedictine colleges of Oxford. Rather, the hall had a tenuous connection with Westminster Abbey by virtue of its establishment by Ampleforth Abbey. In the 960s or early 970s, Saint Dunstan, assisted by King Edgar, installed a community of Benedictine monks at Westminster. Although the Benedictine priories and abbeys in England were closed during the dissolution of the monasteries, one solitary Benedictine monastery was re-established in Westminster Abbey in 1553 by Mary I as part of her unsuccessful attempt to restore Catholicism in England. After her death, Elizabeth I dissolved the monastery once again. By 1607, only one of the Westminster monks was still alive, Dom Sigebert Buckley (c. 1520–1610). In 1608, Buckley &quot;aggregated&quot; two English exiles who had become monks of the Italian Cassinese Congregation, and thereby allegedly passed on to them the &quot;rights and privileges&quot; of the mediaeval English Benedictine abbeys (to be distinguished from the post-Reformation English Benedictine Congregation). In 1615, these two English monks became part of a community which took up residence in the abandoned collegiate church of Saint Laurent, in the town of Dieulouard, near Nancy in the Lorraine region of north-eastern France. The monks adopted St Lawrence as their patron saint. In 1792, Dieulouard Priory was closed and the monks were expelled from France as part of the hostility against the clergy associated with the French Revolution. They opted to return to England.

At that time a Benedictine monk-priest, Fr Anselm Bolton, was the chaplain to Lady Anne Fairfax at Gilling Castle, North Yorkshire. She was the only daughter of Charles Gregory Fairfax, 9th and last Viscount Fairfax of Emley. She built Ampleforth Lodge for Fr Bolton just before she died in 1792. In 1802, Bolton handed this house over to his brethren from Dieulouard who had been living in England without a permanent home for a decade. The lodge became their new monastery, Ampleforth Priory. In 1803, the monks established Ampleforth College, today an independent Catholic secondary school.

The priory was elevated to the status of an independent abbey in 1899 by Pope Leo XIII in the papal bull &quot;Diu quidem est&quot;. Ampleforth Abbey renamed the hall of studies as St. Benet&#x27;s Hall in 1918 when it became a permanent private hall of the university.

===Private hall of studies===
In October 1897, the priory had established a private hall of studies at Oxford for the purpose of enabling its monks to read for secular degrees at the University of Oxford. The hall was not founded as a theological college but rather as a place where student monks could read for a degree in any secular subject.

Private halls of study at the university took their name from their Master, and so the hall was known successively as Hunter-Blair&#x27;s Hall and Parker&#x27;s Hall. It was initially housed at 103 Woodstock Road. This house is still in existence, opposite SS Philip and James Church, and is now a guest-house. The hall was there until 1904, when it moved to the former Grindle&#x27;s Hall in Beaumont Street, from which it removed in 1922 to the present buildings of 38 and 39 St Giles. The Beaumont Street houses were demolished in 1938 to make space for the Oxford Playhouse theatre.

===Permanent private hall of the University of Oxford===
St Benet&#x27;s became a permanent private hall of the university in 1918, after new university legislation created the status of PPH. It took as its official name &quot;Aula Privata Sancti Benedicti&quot;: in English, &quot;St Benedict&#x27;s (or St Benet&#x27;s) Private Hall&quot;. (Benet is a mediaeval English variant of the name Benedict.) It was named after St Benedict of Nursia (c. 480–547), the founder of the Benedictine order, father of western monasticism and a patron saint of Europe and of students.

The character of the hall changed over the years, acquiring fellows in imitation of the university&#x27;s constituent colleges. However, as a PPH of the university, the hall&#x27;s fellows did not constitute its governing body. Rather, they shared with the master the day-to-day running of the hall, and elected one of their number to serve as a trustee of the St Benet&#x27;s Trust when that charity was founded in 2012. Before then, the hall was a private possession of Ampleforth Abbey. The hall matriculated students to be members of the university, so those of its student body who matriculated were full members of the university in all ways, and were able to supplicate for degrees on the successful completion of their studies. For most of its members the only noticeable difference made by the hall&#x27;s legal status is that it was very much smaller than any of the Oxford constituent colleges.

With the decline of monastic vocations beginning in the 1960s, more and more Roman Catholic laymen were admitted - especially under Master James Forbes OSB, including some Old Amplefordians. Under Master Philip Holdsworth OSB (1979–1989), the hall again emphasised a monastic ethos and also became more theological in character, with many monks from the English Benedictine Congregation and other Benedictine Congregations studying theology at Blackfriars. Master Henry Wansbrough (1990–2004) started again to admit laymen, thus creating a mixed focus on theology, philosophy and the humanities.

There was never a policy that lay members of the Hall, both undergraduates and postgraduates, should be Catholics - and in the 21st century most were not. However, all members were asked to be supportive of the monks&#x27; life and values.

A review of the PPHs conducted by the university in 2007 concluded that St Benet&#x27;s had a &quot;good sense of its place within the collegiate University&quot; and drew attention to the &quot;commitment and care&quot; of the hall&#x27;s academic staff. In May 2013 the Student Barometer survey results showed that St Benet&#x27;s Hall had the highest overall student satisfaction score out of the 44 constituent colleges and permanent private halls of the university.

===Sexual abuse scandal===

In 1996 Bernard Green OSB (1953-2013), a monk of Ampleforth Abbey, was convicted of sexually abusing a 14-year old schoolboy at the monastery&#x27;s school, Ampleforth College, in the previous year. He was put on probation and prohibited from teaching. Despite this, the abbey sent him to reside and teach at St Benet&#x27;s Hall in 2000 without, allegedly, informing the hall of his conviction. He was issued with a &quot;final&quot; letter of warning by the university in 2005, after being accused of sexually harassing a 19-year-old undergraduate member of the hall. This letter was supposedly unknown to the hall until 2006, but Green was subsequently kept in residence until 2012 when he was finally dismissed. The scandal came to the notice of the national media.

===Final decade===

Until 2012, the Master of the hall was always a Benedictine monk from Ampleforth. On 1 September of that year, Werner Jeanrond, formerly holder of the 1640 Chair of Divinity at the University of Glasgow, became the new Master. He was the first Catholic layman ever to run the hall. Jeanrond became a full member of the Faculty of Theology and Religion at Oxford and was engaged in both teaching and research, as well as serving as head of house. 

Until 2016, St Benet&#x27;s was the last constituent body of the University of Oxford admitting only men. It was also the last single-sex college or hall in the university after St Hilda&#x27;s College, the last all-women&#x27;s college in Oxford, admitted men in 2008. In November 2013, under Professor Jeanrond, the hall announced its intention to admit women graduate students within one year and women undergraduates as soon as additional housing facilities were obtained. Women were admitted as graduate students in October 2014, and as undergraduates in October 2016. Thus 2016 was the year when all constituent colleges and halls of the university became fully coeducational. (The University of Cambridge retains two constituent colleges for female students only.)

To allow for the admission of undergraduate women, in October 2015 St Benet&#x27;s Hall acquired a hall of residence owned by the Sisters of the Sacred Heart, at 11 Norham Gardens, next to University Parks and near Lady Margaret Hall. So the hall became a co-educational academic community, latterly consisting of 84 undergraduate students and 48 graduate students of all faiths and none.

The degree subjects to which the last undergraduate students were admitted by St Benet&#x27;s were: Theology, Philosophy and Theology, Theology and Oriental Studies, History, History and Politics, History and Economics, Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE), Classics, Classics with Oriental Studies, Oriental Studies (Egyptology; Egyptology and Ancient Near Eastern Studies, Islamic Studies, Hebrew Studies, and Jewish Studies), Oriental Studies with Classics, and Human Science. The hall admitted graduate students from the same subjects as undergraduates as well as those who studied at the Blavatnik School of Government, the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology, and the Saïd Business School.
===Closure===
In September 2021, it was announced that the John and Daria Barry Foundation, a philanthropic trust run by the venture capitalist John F. Barry III, was making a £40 million rescue offer to enable the hall to become completely independent of Ampleforth Abbey. This was on condition that the buildings would be purchased from the Ampleforth Abbey Trust for £15 million (less than their market value), that the St Benet&#x27;s Trust was to be made completely separate from the abbey and that the chair was to be the prominent conservative philosopher and academic Robert P. George of Princeton University. Barry himself was on record as describing the venture as a Hail Mary pass, indicating limited expectations of success.

However, in December of that year, the university stated that without the abbey&#x27;s continued financial support, &quot;it cannot be confident that the hall can support a new undergraduate cohort for the full duration of their studies&quot;. The major issues were that the hall&#x27;s endowments were inadequate, the two buildings were owned by Ampleforth Abbey and operational deficits were being covered by subsidies from the abbey.

So, the university announced that it would temporarily cease to accept undergraduate matriculations from the hall, owing to these serious financial issues. May 2022 was the deadline for deciding this point as regards the academic year 2022–3.

In that month it was made public that the University Council had decided not to renew the hall&#x27;s PPH licence, which implied that the hall would close at the end of the 2022 academic year. The university had decided that the new arrangements proposed by the Barry Foundation would not be financially viable and questioned the implications of the new board, and so they were rejected.

In June 2022 it was finally announced that the buildings would be vacated by October 2022, and that the university was seeking alternative colleges to which existing students would transfer. The buildings were subsequently purchased by St Hilda&#x27;s College. The hall was formally closed on 30 September 2022. The last member of staff vacated the St Giles house on 7 October. The wine cellar of 1,100 bottles was donated to Blackfriars. Students relocated individually to other colleges and halls of the university to continue their studies. The St Benet&#x27;s Hall Boat Club continues to operate.

==St Benet&#x27;s Hall Association==
The St Benet’s Hall Association was a not-for-profit organisation founded in 2007 by Benet’s alumni. Its purpose was to promote a close relationship amongst those who studied, lived or taught at St Benet’s Hall. 

Following the dissolution of the Hall, the role of the Association was assumed by the Regent&#x27;s Park College Development Office, who established &quot;St Benet&#x27;s at Regent&#x27;s&quot; to be a home for St Benet&#x27;s alumni in Oxford. At the last Regent&#x27;s Formal Hall of Trinity Term 2024, a new Regent’s-St Benet’s shield was unveiled; hung above the entrance to Helwys Hall, the plaque symbolises the joining of the two communities.

==Former Buildings==
===38 and 39 St Giles===

The hall occupied 38-39 St Giles from 1923 to 2022. This is a rather plain late Regency style edifice of four storeys, with a further attic storey and cellars. The cellar area ensured that the original set of wrought iron railings have survived, as has a wrought iron balcony across the façade at the second storey. The first storey has six round-headed windows in recessed frames, flanked by a pair of matching doors with fanlights. The second storey has eight tall rectangular windows, complemented by shorter ones for the third storey and square ones for the fourth. The third and fourth storeys are separated by a moulded string course which is the only decorative feature of the façade. The slate mansard roof has attic windows inserted.

The dining hall took up most of the ground floor, and the common room and library were above that. The chapel is a red brick garden annexe in a vaguely Gothic style.

The original building dates from 1830, and was constructed as two separate houses (38 and 39). The site was previously part of a coster&#x27;s (i.e., fruit seller&#x27;s) yard and stable. In the nineteenth century, the two houses served as private homes for several Anglican clergy connected to the university, and to a number of widows of independent means.

The northern house (38 St Giles) was, in 1841, occupied as the private dwelling of the Rev. Philip Bliss, Registrar of the University of Oxford and later principal of St Mary&#x27;s Hall. Bliss lived there with his wife and four servants. A decade later, it was the home of the university&#x27;s public orator and vice principal and later principal of Magdalen Hall, the Rev. Richard Michell. In 1874, Michell became first principal of the refounded Hertford College. After a two-year period as the Oxford High School (1879–1881), it became a private home once more, belonging briefly to Charlotte Cotton, widow of the Rev. Richard Lynch Cotton, provost of Worcester College (1881–1882). It then belonged to the Rev. S. J. Hulme, chaplain of Wadham College (1884–1887). In 1889, it served briefly as the Oxford Eye Hospital which is today part of the John Radcliffe Hospital. In 1891, it was acquired by Madame de Leobardy and opened as St Ursula&#x27;s Convent, a boarding and day school for Roman Catholic girls.

The southern house (39 St Giles) was the private home of Letitia Pett (1841–1846) and Maria Brown (1852–1861), both widows. It was then acquired by the Rev.Richard Greswell, tutor in theology at Worcester College, and his family (1861–1881). After his death in 1881, his widow Joanna Greswell lived in the house until 1894. The British military historian Sir Charles William Chadwick Oman, a fellow of All Souls College and the Chichele Professor of Modern History, acquired the house in 1898 and lived there until 1908. In 1909, it too was purchased by Madame de Leobardy and became an extension of the convent school next door. The chapel in the garden is evidence of this.

St Ursula&#x27;s Convent School closed in 1922. Ampleforth Abbey acquired both buildings in 1923, and combined the two into one residence. It was the sole building of St Benet&#x27;s Hall until 2015. 

===11 Norham Gardens===
A large house in Norham Gardens was acquired in 2015, as part of the policy of expansion begun in 2012.

The original Victorian Gothic villa was built in 1860 and designed by William Wilkinson, who was also responsible for the Randolph Hotel, Oxford. Norham Gardens is in an area originally known as Norham Manor and was owned by St John&#x27;s College. Past occupants of 11 Norham Gardens include Henry Balfour, the first curator of the Pitt Rivers Museum, and Francis Llewellyn Griffith, the first professor of Egyptology at Oxford. Griffith&#x27;s archaeological finds form the backbone of the Egyptian collections at the Ashmolean Museum. In 1932 the Society of the Sacred Heart, a Roman Catholic order of nuns, purchased the villa. The purpose of this acquisition was to provide accommodation for women students at Oxford registered at the Society of Oxford Home-Students which later became St Anne&#x27;s College. In 1951, a new wing was added as a student hostel providing 21 rooms. These rooms also accommodated women at St Anne&#x27;s, which became a constituent college of the university in 1952. The association with St Anne&#x27;s lessened over time and women students (mostly undergraduates) from across the university lived in the hostel, whilst the Sisters lived in the villa. By the 1990s the student population in the hostel became entirely postgraduate, housing both men and women of any faith or none. In spring 2015, the Sacred Heart Sisters decided to sell the house and hostel complex to St Benet&#x27;s Hall to enable the latter to become fully co-educational by Michaelmas Term 2016.

==Administration==
The governing body of the hall comprised the trustees of a charity known as the St Benet&#x27;s Trust, created in 2012 with the trust&#x27;s chair being &quot;ex officio&quot; the Abbot of Ampleforth Abbey. However, the assets of this Trust were wholly owned by the Ampleforth Abbey Trust. In 2016, Abbot Cuthbert Madden resigned after allegations of sexual abuse and was replaced as chair by a lay fellow.

Unlike the university&#x27;s colleges and other PPHs, St Benet&#x27;s had a joint common room of which all at the hall were members. The JCR had its own committee, and was responsible for running the St Benet&#x27;s bar and gym facilities.

==Refectory==

Again unlike the university&#x27;s constituent colleges, the hall did not have a high table but one common dining table shared by all members. Members of the hall were entitled to invite guests to all meals, with the result that fellows, lecturers, monks, students, and their guests mixed freely. The dining hall was known as the refectory, in accordance with monastic tradition.

The following grace was said in Latin before every formal Hall meal, which at St Benet&#x27;s was latterly held on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday. It was recited by the Master or a person he designated. In addition, after grace, an undergraduate student would read a short passage from the Rule of St Benedict in English.

::&quot;Gratiarum actio ante cibum&quot;
::Benedic Domine,
::nos et haec tua dona
::quae de tua largitate sumus sumpturi,
::per Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen

::&quot;Grace before the meal&quot;
::Bless us, O Lord,
::and these thy gifts
::which we are about to receive from thy bounty,
::through Christ our Lord. Amen.

Grace after the meal was said in Latin after formal hall by the chaplain in the following form:

::&quot;Gratiarum actio post cibum&quot;
::Agimus tibi gratias,
::omnipotens Deus,
::pro universis beneficiis tuis,
::qui vivis et regnas in saecula saeculorum. Amen.

::&quot;Grace after the meal&quot;
::We give thee thanks,
::O almighty God,
::for all thy benefits,
::who livest and reignest for ever and ever. Amen.

==Sport==
Despite the small size of the hall, the St Benet&#x27;s Hall Boat Club raced an eight boat on the River Thames for many years. In recent years, it has had a good record of winning &#x27;blades&#x27;, the trophy awarded for &#x27;bumping&#x27; (rowing past teams ranked above) every day in the Torpids and Summer Eights bumps races. The Boat Club&#x27;s M1 won blades most recently in 2019. Although the Hall is closed, the St. Benet&#x27;s Hall Boat Club still exists. 
The hall also had its own netball, rugby sevens, and field hockey teams, as well as a football team joint with Regent&#x27;s Park College. The Benet&#x27;s rugby sevens team is the back-to-back 2018 and 2019 Oxford University rugby sevens champion.

==Coat of arms==

St Benet&#x27;s Hall used the same coat of arms as Ampleforth Abbey and Ampleforth College but, like the college, without the abbot&#x27;s crozier and galero (ecclesiastical hat with tassels). The arms were granted to the abbey by the English College of Arms in 1922. The abbey made the application to the College of Arms to regularise its armorial position as the alleged lineal descendant of Westminster Abbey. The purpose of this move was to conform to proper authority and thus not be open to the charge of lack of consideration for post-Reformation bodies already bearing variants of the Westminster arms in their own line of heraldic descent.

The Pre-Reformation City of Westminster sometimes used a red shield with two keys in saltire to symbolise Saint Peter to whom its Abbey Church was dedicated. In addition, Westminster also used a blue shield with a gold “cross flory” between five gold martlets (heraldic birds). This forms the attributed arms of St Edward the Confessor (reign 1042–1066), the last Anglo-Saxon king of England, who is regarded as the principal patron and founder of Westminster Abbey. Both these arms appear in the chief (top portion) of the shield. The base (lower portion) of the shield is gold and blue divided “dancetté” (by a zigzag line). This represents the arms of the pre-Reformation Abbots of Westminster who would place their personal coat of arms in the top portion (chief) of the shield. The last Benedictine Abbot of Westminster to use this coat of arms was John Feckenham (c. 1515–1584) who was removed from office by Elizabeth I in 1560 at the final suppression of the abbey. The abbey church then became known as the Collegiate Church of St Peter, Westminster, which remains its official name to this day.

The shield of Ampleforth Abbey, Ampleforth College, and St Benet&#x27;s Hall was thus a combination of three shields – the first representing St Peter (top left), the second representing St Edward the Confessor (top right), and the bottom representing the pre-Reformation Benedictine Abbots of Westminster. The heraldic blazon of the arms is as follows: &quot;Per fesse dancetté Or and Azure a chief per pale Gules and of the second charged on the dexter with two keys in saltire Or and Argent and on the sinister with a Cross Flory between five martlets of the first.&quot; Although not official, the motto associated with the hall is &quot;Ausculta, O fili, praecepta magistri&quot; which translates as &quot;Listen, O [my] son, to the precepts of [thy] master.&quot; This is taken from the Latin original of the opening line of the prologue to the Rule of St. Benedict.

<text>St Edmund Hall (sometimes known as The Hall or informally as Teddy Hall) is a constituent college of the University of Oxford. The college claims to be &quot;the oldest surviving academic society to house and educate undergraduates in any university&quot; and was the last surviving medieval academic hall at the university.

The college is on Queen&#x27;s Lane and the High Street, in central Oxford. After more than seven centuries as a men-only college, it became coeducational in 1979. As of 2019, the college had a financial endowment of more than £65 million.

Notable alumni of St Edmund Hall include current British prime minister Keir Starmer, diplomats Robert Macaire and Mark Sedwill, politicians Richard Onslow, 1st Baron Onslow and Mel Stride, as well as journalists Samira Ahmed (1986, English) and Anna Botting (1986, Geography). The elected Honorary Fellows: Faith Wainwright, MBE FREng (1980, Engineering) and the Hon Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth (1984, BCL).

In 2019, St Edmund Hall launched its 10-year strategy to improve access to higher education, increase the number of student scholarships, bursaries and academic fellowships at the Hall and improve its estate facilities and sustainability credentials. This was followed by the launch of HALLmarks, a £50 million campaign in 2022 to fundraise for a new student accommodation building at Norham Gardens in North Oxford as well as student support and fellowship endowment projects. 

==History==

Similar to the University of Oxford itself, the precise date of establishment of St Edmund Hall is not certain; it is usually estimated at 1236, before any other college was formally established, though the founder from whom the Hall takes its name, locally-born Edmund of Abingdon, the first known Oxford Master of Arts and the first Oxford-educated Archbishop of Canterbury, lived and taught on the college site as early as the 1190s. The name St Edmund Hall (&quot;Aula Sancti Edmundi&quot;) first appears in a 1317 rental agreement.
Before that, the house appeared as the ‘house of Cowley’ in rental agreements with the abbey. Thomas of Malsbury, the Vicar of Cowley, partially conveyed the site and its buildings to the abbey in 1270-71, having purchased it for eight pounds nine years previously. Cowley fully conveyed the property to the abbey in 1289-90 with an annuity of &#x27;thirteen shillings and fourpence&#x27; (i.e. one &quot;mark&quot;) paid to himself and eight shillings for his niece.
During the thirteenth century, the university encouraged masters of the arts to rent properties to take in scholars as their tenants. The university preferred such arrangements over private lodgings, which it linked to loose living, poor discipline, public disorder and fighting. Moreover, university-approved accommodation run by approved principals, gave the university more oversight. Principals leased the halls annually and had to present themselves in front of the university&#x27;s chancellor in St Mary&#x27;s church yearly and guarantee that their hall would pay its rent. Halls whose principals undertook this formality earned recognition as academic halls.
John de Cornuba leased the Hall from Osney Abbey, a large Augustinian institution in the neighbouring town of Osney, for 35 shillings annually.
The Abbey&#x27;s rent collections varied from 15 shillings for small institutions to four pounds for larger institutions. Judging by the Hall&#x27;s annual rent sum, St Edmund&#x27;s was a small to medium-sized academic hall at the time. However, by 1324-5 Osney Abbey had raised the Hall&#x27;s rent to 46/8 while rents for other student hall&#x27;s in the city had fallen. The rent increase indicates that the site expanded after 1318. Letters sent to Osney showed that the abbey gained two additional plots of land and buildings adjacent to the Hall and leased it to St Edmund Hall. The acquisition increased the Hall&#x27;s capacity and also gave it access to the well which forms the centrepiece of the quadrangle.

St Edmund Hall began as one of Oxford&#x27;s ancient Aularian houses, the medieval halls that laid the University&#x27;s foundation, preceding the creation of the first colleges. As the only surviving medieval hall, its members are known as &quot;Aularians&quot;.
===Lollardism===
The college has a history of independent thought, which brought it into frequent conflict with both Church and State. During the late 14th and early 15th centuries, it was a bastion of John Wycliffe&#x27;s supporters, pejoratively referred to as Lollards. This group of reformists challenged Papal supremacy, condemning practices such as Clerical celibacy, offerings to effigies, confession, and pilgrimage. They also believed that transubstantiation was tantamount to necromancy and felt that the Church&#x27;s pursuit of arts and crafts was wasteful. However, it was their early Bible translations and belief that everyone should have access to scriptures which they were primarily known for. Ultimately, Lollardism would assimilate with Protestantism in the 1500s culminating in King Henry VIII&#x27;s English Reformation.
====William Taylor====
The Hall&#x27;s reformist activities caught the attention of Archbishop Thomas Arundel who opposed Lollardism. Arundel witnessed a sermon given by Principal William Taylor at St Paul&#x27;s Cross in 1406 or 1407 and summoned him. However, Taylor failed to appear and was subsequently excommunicated for contumacy. Following his excommunication, Taylor embarked on a career as a Lollard preacher. In 1419/20 Archbishop Chichele absolved Taylor after he confessed to preaching whilst excommunicated. However, he was arrested soon thereafter for espousing unorthodox opinions in Bristol&#x27;s Holy Trinity Church. Subsequently, Taylor was declared a relapsed heretic, handed over to the secular courts and burnt at the stake.
====Peter Payne====
Taylor&#x27;s successor Peter Payne, also a Lollard, continued supporting Wycliffe&#x27;s opinions. It is believed that Payne was partly converted to Lollardism by John Purvey, one of Wycliffe&#x27;s original supporters. Purvey advocated for vernacular translations of the Bible, and compelled Payne to defend Wycliffe&#x27;s translations of the scriptures. Payne drew hostility from Oxford&#x27;s friars after allegedly purloining the University&#x27;s common seal and using it to seal a letter sent to the ecclesiastical reformer Jan Hus in Prague. His letter claimed that Oxford and all of England barring the friars shared the same views that Hus&#x27;s supporters (the Hussites) shared in Prague. The letter also commended Wycliffe&#x27;s life and teachings and because he sealed it with the University&#x27;s seal the Hussites accepted it as genuine. 
Arundel deemed the college&#x27;s activities dangerous enough to warrant an intervention and suppression. Arundel began by banning Oxford&#x27;s schools from using Wycliffe&#x27;s texts unless approved by a committee and ordered that all of Oxford&#x27;s principals make monthly inquiries to make sure their scholars&#x27; views were orthodox. Next, he ordered each committee to go through Wycliffe&#x27;s writings and draw up a list of errors and heresys which he presented to the King. The King wrote to the university ordering that anyone holding reformist opinions be placed in prison. Payne fled the country after he left Oxford in 1412.

===Seventeenth century onwards===
In the late 17th and 18th centuries, St Edmund Hall incurred the wrath of the Crown for fostering non-jurors, men who remained loyal to the Jacobite succession of the House of Stuart and who refused to take the oath to their successors after 1688, whom they regarded as having usurped the British throne.

In 1877, Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli appointed commissioners to consider and implement reform of the university and its colleges and halls. The commissioners concluded that the four remaining medieval halls were not viable and should merge with colleges on the death or resignation of the incumbent principals. In 1881, the commissioners issued University Statutes which provided for a partial merger of St Edmund with Queen&#x27;s and for the other halls to merge with colleges. 

By 1903, only St Edmund Hall remained. Principal Edward Moore wished to retire and become a resident canon in Canterbury Cathedral. Queen&#x27;s College proposed an amended statute for complete rather than partial merger, which was rejected by the Congregation. In 1912 a statute was passed preserving the independence of the hall, which enabled Moore to retire. Queen Elizabeth II approved St Edmund Hall&#x27;s charter of incorporation as a full college of the University of Oxford in 1957, although it deliberately retained its ancient title of &quot;Hall&quot;. The Duke of Edinburgh presented the royal charter to the college in June 1958.

In 1978, women were first admitted as members of the Hall, with the first matriculations of women in 1979. In 2015, the college celebrated the matriculation of its 3000th female student with events and exhibitions, including the display of portraits of notable women who had taught, studied or worked at the Hall in the Dining Hall, a noticeable change from the styles of portraits in most colleges. Between 2015 and 2017, the proportion of UK undergraduates admitted to St Edmund Hall who were women was 42.3%.

==Buildings and grounds==
St Edmund Hall is located in central Oxford, on the north side of the High Street, off Queen&#x27;s Lane. It borders New College to the North and the Carrodus Quad of The Queen&#x27;s College to the south. The front quadrangle houses the porters&#x27; lodge, the Old Dining Hall, built in the 1650s, the college bar (the buttery), the chapel, the Old Library, offices and accommodation for students and Fellows.

===Entrance===

An engraving of the college coat of arms is found above the entrance to the college on Queen&#x27;s Lane. As seen in this image, the coat of arms sits above the following Latin dedication &quot;&quot;sanctus edmundus huius aulae lux&quot;, or &quot;St Edmund, light of this Hall&quot;&quot;.

It is a very common practice within the University to use chronograms for dedications. When transcribed into Latin, they are written in such a way that an important date, usually that of a foundation or the dedication itself, is embedded in the text in Roman numerals.

In the above dedication, the text is rendered as

sanCtVs edMVndVs hVIVs aVLae LVX

and, in this case, adding the numerals gives:

C + V + M + V + V + V + I + V + V + L + L + V + X = 1246

(For this reading one must disregard the usual &quot;subtractive&quot; convention — according to which, for example, &quot;IV&quot; would be 4, not 6.) The year 1246 is the date of the canonisation of St Edmund of Abingdon.

===Well===

In the centre of the quadrangle is a medieval well, which was uncovered in 1926 during the construction of a new lecture room and accommodation. This well is believed to be the original from which St Edmund himself drew water. A new wellhead was added, with the inscription &quot;haurietis aquas in gaudio de fontibus salvatoris&quot;&quot;, Latin for &quot;with joy, draw water from the wells of salvation&quot;. These words, from Isaiah 12:3, are believed to be those spoken by St Edmund on his deathbed at Salisbury. A metal grate was added to the well to prevent injuries, but water can still be seen in the well at a depth of about 9 feet. Plans to add a wooden frame and bucket were scrapped to maintain the overall appearance of the quad.

===Chapel===
The east side of the Front Quad contains the chapel, consecrated in 1682. The chapel contains a stained glass window which is one of the earliest works by the artists Sir Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris, and a painting above the altar named &quot;Supper at Emmaus&quot;, by Ceri Richards. Often described as a &#x27;marmite painting&#x27; due to its anachronous style within the chapel, the painting commemorates the granting of the college&#x27;s Royal Charter. The organ was built by Wood of Huddersfield in the 1980s. The St Edmund Hall Chapel Choir consists of eight choral scholars, two organ scholars and many other non-auditioning singers. The choir goes on two annual tours, including trips to Wells Cathedral in 2017, Pontigny, France, the burial place of St Edmund, in 2016 and Warsaw, Poland in 2015.

===Old Library===
Above the chapel is the Old Library. It was the last among Oxford colleges to chain its valuable books, but the first to have shelves against the walls. The Old Library is no longer the main library of the Hall, but is used for events and for research.

===Library===

The college library, the deconsecrated 12th-century church of St Peter-in-the-East, was converted in the 1970s, and includes the 14th-century tower, which houses a tutor&#x27;s room at the top. The oldest part of the library still standing is the crypt below the church, which dates from the 1130s. The library is situated in the original churchyard of St Peter-in-the-East. 40,000 volumes are housed within it to cater to the wide variety of courses offered at the Hall. While many of the graves have had their contents disinterred, several gravestones remain including one belonging to balloonist James Sadler, the first English aeronaut, and another which states the occupant died upon February 31. The garden contains a seated bronze sculpture of St Edmund as an impoverished student.

===Modern buildings===
In 1934, the Oxford-based architect Fielding Dodd completed the south side of the college&#x27;s quadrangle, marking the 700th anniversary of Edmund of Abingdon&#x27;s consecration as the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1965–9, Kenneth Stevens and Partners, inheritors of Dodd&#x27;s architectural practice, worked on a large programme of new building at the college, including a new dining hall, common rooms, teaching facilities, and undergraduate accommodation. These are at the rear of the main site in the Kelly, Emden, Besse, and Whitehall buildings. All first-year undergraduate students are guaranteed accommodation on the main site and many return for their third year after living out, usually in East Oxford, for the duration of their second year. The Wolfson Hall, the 20th-century dining hall, seats approximately 230 people and is used by students on a daily basis for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

===Annexes===
The college also owns annexes at Norham Gardens, on Dawson Street, and on Iffley Road.

The Norham Gardens annexe includes the Graduate Centre, a complex consisting of several large Victorian villas, including Gunfield. This site was for many years the home of St Stephen&#x27;s House, Oxford, before that institution moved to Iffley Road in 1980. The Norham Gardens annexe has the capacity to house most first-year graduate students and has its own common room, IT facilities, gardens and gym. In addition to student rooms, the Graduate Centre also has a quantity of faculty housing. The Dawson Street and Iffley Road annexes host undergraduates who do not live on the main site in pleasant en-suite, self-catering rooms.

==Student life==
As of 2017, the college has roughly 410 undergraduate, 300 graduate students and 75 Fellows, organised into three common rooms. The Junior Common Room (JCR), for undergraduates, and Middle Common Room (MCR), for postgraduates, both organise regular events, including a Freshers&#x27; week programme, dinners and film nights. The college is reputed for the strength of its &#x27;Hall Spirit&#x27; with the semi-finals and finals of sports competitions regularly attended by in excess of 70 supporters.

===Creative writing===
The college has a weekly creative writing workshop, a termly poetry reading series, an online writers&#x27; forum and &quot;The St Edmund Hall Gallery,&quot; the annual student arts and literary magazine. College students also run &#x27;TART&#x27; or &#x27;Teddy Art&#x27; another arts and culture magazine.

The college runs an annual journalism competition for Oxford University students, in memory of alumnus and promising young journalist Philip Geddes, who died in the IRA bombing of Harrods in 1983. The college also hosts an annual lecture in his name.

===Drama===
St Edmund Hall has a lively drama society, the John Oldham Society, which worked in Cameroon in 2013 on a community drama project. In 2017-18 the College&#x27;s entry into Drama Cuppers, the satirical &#x27;Oswald French&#x27;, written and starring Hugh Shepherd-Cross, reached the final round, and two students directed and produced a play called God of Carnage, which sold out its entire run at the Burton Taylor Studio. In 2019-20 the John Oldham Society staged a production of The Importance of Being Earnest. The production sold out and was very well received, with the profits being donated to Stonewall.

===Music===
The College has one of the largest non-auditioning college choirs in Oxford, which is anchored by two Organ Scholars and eight Choral Scholars, under the direction of James Whitbourn, the Director of Music, until his death in 2024. The choir performs an evensong every Sunday and on special occasions, including the Feast Day of St Edmund and the popular &#x27;Carols in the Quad&#x27; event at Christmas. The Choir take part in an annual exchange with Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, a UK residential (previous destinations have included Wells and Worcester Cathedrals), and visits Pontigny, France on tour each year to perform.

During Hilary term 2018, several events were held, including the Intercollegiate Evensong at the University Church; the joint service with the Hall&#x27;s sister college, Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge; and the joint Ash Wednesday service with University College. The term ended with an exploration of Lenten music through Buxtehude&#x27;s cycle of cantatas: Membra Jesu Nostri. The Choir was joined by members of the period instrument ensemble Instruments of Time &amp; Truth for a performance of the first three cantatas in the cycle.

===Sport===
St Edmund Hall participates in a large number of sports including rugby, football, rowing, tennis, cricket, mixed lacrosse, netball, hockey, swimming, gymnastics, and basketball, among others. Since becoming a college in 1957, the Men&#x27;s Rugby Union team has won over half the Cuppers Tournaments it has ever entered (33 wins from 62 attempts). As a part of a team consisting of several colleges, Teddy Hall won women&#x27;s rugby Cuppers in 2015–2016. In 2016–2017, St Edmund Hall won men&#x27;s football and cricket Cuppers and its women&#x27;s first boat and men&#x27;s second boat won blades in Bumps. In 2017-2018 the College recorded victories in Men&#x27;s Basketball (by 74-49 in the final), Swimming (for the third consecutive year), Men&#x27;s Rugby, Women&#x27;s Rugby (joint with Mansfield and Pembroke), Rounders (after an unbeaten season), and Pool. Men&#x27;s Rugby was won 20-17 over St Peter&#x27;s College. Cricket Cuppers was almost retained. Finals were also reached by the Men&#x27;s 2nd XI, the Mixed Hockey team, the Tennis Club, and the 2nd VII went unbeaten in their netball league. Strong performances are also consistently recorded in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hockey, badminton and canoe polo.

The St Edmund Hall Boat Club held the men&#x27;s headship in Summer Eights five times between 1959 and 1965 and women&#x27;s headship from 2006 to 2009. The SEHBC women currently sit second on the river behind Christchurch in Summer Eights. SEHBC had success at the Henley Royal Regatta during its era of dominance in Oxford rowing in the 1960s.

* In 1958 an SEH coxless IV were the losing finalists in the Ladies&#x27; Challenge Plate, losing to Keble by 3 lengths.

* In 1959 a joint SEH/Lincoln College VIII won the Stewards&#x27; Challenge Cup, beating GS Moto Guzzi of Italy easily.

* In 1960 another joint SEH/Lincoln College VIII were the losing finalists in the Stewards&#x27; Challenge Cup, being beaten by Barn Cottage BC by 4 lengths.

* In 1961 an SEH coxless IV won the Visitors&#x27; Challenge Cup, beating St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge by 1½ lengths.

* In 1963 the 1st VIII were the losing finalists in the Ladies&#x27; Challenge Plate, losing to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst by ½ length.

* In 1965, SEHBC had two victories; the 1st VIII won The Ladies&#x27; Challenge Plate, beating Jesus College, Cambridge by ¾ length, and an SEHBC coxless IV won the Visitors&#x27; Challenge Cup, beating Fitzwilliam House, Cambridge by 2 lengths.

In 2023, the Hall won Octopush, underwater Hockey Cuppers and Triathlon Cuppers for the first time. The St Edmund Hall A swimming team won the Cuppers in 2023.

The college celebrates the students’ successes in sports, arts and other extra-curricular activities at the annual Achievements Dinner. Cuppers winning teams are also rewarded with their photograph in the college bar, the walls of which are now crammed with teams dating from the late nineteenth century to the present day. The college also awards the Luddington Prize to undergraduate students who manage to achieve both a First Class degree in finals and a university Blue.

==Outreach==
The College has a very active outreach and access programme, employing two full-time staff and supported by a team of over 30 volunteer Student Ambassadors. Working with schools in the assigned link areas, including Leicestershire, Rutland, Derby and Derbyshire, the College hosts visits from school groups and was one of the first colleges to take student ambassadors on an access roadshow. This saw four students and the Schools Liaison Officer visit nine schools in 4 days in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight in 2016 (previous link regions) and continues to take place annually. In 2023, the College launched its Unlock Oxford programme which aims to support students from backgrounds underrepresented at Oxford and increase the number of applications from its link areas.

==Formal Hall and college graces==
The usual grace given before Formal Hall, as said by the fellow presiding at the dinner, is:

The post cibum grace, given following pudding, is a slight variant on the above:

To which the assembly responds &quot;Amen&quot;. More extended (or sung) forms of the grace are sometimes given but these are limited to special occasions, such as the Feast of St Edmund, a formal held each year to commemorate the namesake of the hall.

The traditional college toast is occasionally also said at dinners, and is simply &quot;Floreat Aula&quot;, Latin for &quot;May the Hall Flourish&quot;.

<text>St Catherine&#x27;s College (colloquially called St Catz or Catz) is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford. In 1974, it was also one of the first men&#x27;s colleges to admit women. It has 528 undergraduate students, 385 graduate students and 37 visiting students as of December 2020, making it one of the largest colleges in either Oxford or Cambridge.

Designed by Danish architect Arne Jacobsen, the college was built in an egalitarian architectural style that maximises the number of rooms, for academically qualified students who lacked the financial resources to study at Oxford. In September 2023, access to areas of the college was restricted due to safety concerns around the use of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC).

The college developed out of the university&#x27;s St Catherine&#x27;s Society; it was granted full status as a college in 1962 by the historian Alan Bullock, who became the first master of the college, and later vice-chancellor of the university.

==History==

St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford traces its origins to 1868. In its first iteration, it was established as a delegacy for (&#x27;Scholars enrolled in no college or hall&#x27;), by university statute on 11 June 1868. This delegacy, informally known as the &quot;Delegacy for Unattached Students&quot;, was created in response to the recommendation of a Royal Commission in 1850, that the university be open to a &quot;larger and poorer&quot; sector of the population. The delegacy, by allowing students to enrol without belonging to a college, would enable less affluent men to gain an Oxford education without the costs of college membership. 

The delegacy appointed two of its stipendiaries, George Kitchin and George S. Ward, to be known as &quot;Censors&quot;, to oversee the education and welfare of the students. Nineteen students matriculated in October 1868 as and were joined throughout the year by another forty, bringing the total number in the first year to 59. Growing quickly, by 1872 the delegacy had admitted 330 students. By 1914, more than 4,000 men had matriculated as non-collegiate students. In 1884, the delegacy was renamed the &quot;Delegacy for Non-Collegiate Students&quot;.

In its first days, a room in the university&#x27;s Old Clarendon Building was allocated for the operations of the delegacy, and with gifts of books from several donors, a library for the unattached students was installed there. These accommodations soon proved inadequate and in 1888, the delegacy was moved to a building in High Street next to the Examination Schools. Here the non-collegiate students, as they were known after 1884, had a library in its own dedicated space and two lecture halls. There was an administration office and rooms for the Censors and tutors. Designed by T. G. Jackson, this building is now the Ruskin School of Art. In 1936, the delegacy moved again, from its outgrown High Street premises to the limestone buildings on St Aldates, south of Christ Church, Oxford which are now part of the Oxford University&#x27;s Faculty of Music.

By 1956, the society had developed many of the characteristics of an Oxford college and the delegates decided to formalise this change in status by obtaining approval to turn it into a fully residential college within the University of Oxford. After acquiring from Merton College, Oxford on part of Holywell Great Meadow for £57,690, monies were sought from the University Grants Committee who also agreed to supply £250,000 towards the building, and additional funds up to £400,000 for all facilities. By 1960, Alan Bullock raised a further £1,000,000 with assistance from two industrialists, Alan Wilson (whom he met by chance on the ) and Sir Hugh Beaver. After a total expenditure of £2.5 million, the college opened in 1962. In 1974, St Catherine&#x27;s was one of the first men&#x27;s colleges to admit women as full members, the others being Brasenose, Jesus College, Hertford and Wadham.

In keeping with its complete history, including its earliest incarnation, the college celebrated its 150th anniversary in the academic year 2018–2019, coinciding with the 2018 Ball &#x27;Continuum&#x27;. The 50th anniversary of the establishment of the College itself, as a &quot;college&quot;, was celebrated in 2012.

===College name===
In 1931, the delegacy officially acquired the name, &quot;St Catherine&#x27;s Society&quot;, with the current spelling. Variations of &quot;St Catharine&quot; having been used by the students for their sporting teams and various clubs since the 1870s, the name was already strongly associated with the delegacy. First forming a social club in April 1869, the students called it the &quot;Clarendon University Club&quot;, taking that name from the Old Clarendon Building where the delegacy had been allocated a room. The students soon expanded their organised activities. By 1874 they began a more comprehensive association, which they called the St Club, after its headquarters, the hall where they dined and held meetings. St Catharine&#x27;s Hall had long been associated with the saint, having been built as a chapel, popularly called St Catherine&#x27;s Chapel, (though officially &quot;Chapel of Our Lady at Smith Gate&quot;). Although deconsecrated, the 16th-century appellation of &quot;St Catharine&#x27;s&quot; remained attached to the site throughout its later history. The building&#x27;s address at the time of the Club&#x27;s tenancy was 29 Broad Street; it fronted, though, onto Catte Street, also known as Catherine Street from some point in the late 19th century until 1930—and first recorded as Kattestreete , &quot;Catte&quot; in 1402, &quot;Cate&quot; or &quot;Kate&quot; in the 17th century, and &quot;Cat&quot; or &quot;Catte&quot; again in the 1800s, the street&#x27;s name enhancing the association with &quot;Catherine&quot;.

In this way, the college became indirectly associated with the saint, Catherine of Alexandria. Despite the initially accidental relationship, St Catherine is celebrated as the college&#x27;s patron saint &quot;with a special Catz Night dinner... at the end of which a giant Catherine wheel is lit in the quad&quot;. Other elements of this can be seen in the college blazon, which depicts four Catherine wheels, one of St Catherine&#x27;s attributes. While religious iconography can also be seen today in some of the college&#x27;s symbols, the college&#x27;s origins were largely secular.

==Buildings==
===Original buildings===

The college is located to the east of central Oxford, on the banks of the River Cherwell. Its buildings in glass, brick, and concrete, by the Danish architect Arne Jacobsen, marry modern materials with a traditional Oxford college layout centred on a quadrangle. Jacobsen designed everything, including the furniture, cutlery, lampshades, and the college gardens, down to the choice of fish species for the pond.

The original St Catherine&#x27;s buildings are recognised as one of the world&#x27;s most distinguished examples of modernist design, described by architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner as &quot;a perfect piece of architecture&quot;, and said to have been the architect&#x27;s personal favourite among his own works. Jacobsen&#x27;s designs for the college have been the subject of various art and design exhibitions. The original college buildings received a Grade I listing in 1993. In 2020, the college gardens, also designed by Jacobsen, were upgraded to the highest level of protection by Historic England for historical and design interest.

Jacobsen&#x27;s plans for the college did not include a chapel, which is unusual among Oxford colleges: St Cross Church on the corner of Manor Road and Longwall Street served this purpose before its decommission in 2008. The St Catherine&#x27;s Christmas carol concert is now held in Harris Manchester College&#x27;s chapel. The college has a bell tower, particularly visible since no college building is more than three storeys high. An extra floor was reputedly planned for most accommodation blocks, but due to regulations concerning safe building on marshland, this was removed from the final design. The entrance to the college by the water garden was remodelled by Sir Philip Howell in 1968.

St Catherine&#x27;s has a number of lecture theatres and seminar rooms, a music house, two student computer rooms, a small gym, squash courts, a punt house, a Grade I listed bike shed and among the most spacious common rooms in Oxford. There are also additional purpose-built conference facilities with lecture theatres, meeting rooms and bar, music room, and car parking available for non-students. The dining hall, which seats 350 diners, has the largest capacity of any Oxford college.

St Catherine&#x27;s also has a library with over 55,000 volumes, which is used mainly by undergraduates in all the disciplines taught at the college, as well as 14 computer terminals. Law students have additional resources located in the college law library, which is in the Bernard Sunley building. Most tutorials are carried out in college, though some undergraduates may be sent to other colleges. For additional resources, the college is next to the Social Science Library, Oxford and Faculty of Law, University of Oxford, which matriculated students are free to use.

The majority of St Catherine&#x27;s buildings are in the form of staircases that open directly onto the quad(s) outside; these are filled with student rooms and office space. There is little indoor space in the college and St Catherine&#x27;s favours a minimalist, rather austere environment, though still comfortable. Student rooms are light and spacious, notable for their curtain wall glazing. The Built Environment Trust, and its public face The Building Centre, in 2021 named the college&#x27;s buildings as among the 90 most influential UK buildings or public spaces from the last 90 years.

===RAAC concrete===

In September 2023 following reviews of the college site for reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) it was discovered a number of buildings contained RAAC. This has prompted the temporary closure of many of the communal spaces such as the JCR, Hall, kitchens and library.

===Extensions===
The college was first expanded in 1983 by Knud Holscher, Jacobsen&#x27;s assistant. It was also extended by Stephen Hodder in two phases, the first from 1994 to 1995 and the second from 2002 to 2005. The first phase included 54 student rooms and the second phase included 132 student rooms, a new porters&#x27; lodge and four seminar rooms. These new buildings form a second quad called &#x27;New Quad&#x27; (in comparison to the Jacobsen-designed &#x27;Old Quad&#x27;), which is largely used as second-year student accommodation.

=== Graduate building ===
In 2017, Purcell Architects gained planning permission for a further extension at the college. The facilities aimed to resemble Jacobsen&#x27;s original designs and was built on the college&#x27;s last available development space. Purcell consulted with Stephen Hodder, who constructed the additional buildings on site during the 1994 and 2004 extensions, when designing the centre. The Ainsworth Graduate Centre is named in honor of Roger Ainsworth, the previous Master of the college. Construction started in July 2018, and was completed in 2019. The centre opened in March 2020 and includes seminar rooms and space for academic works. It also expanded graduate accommodation by creating three new staircases, which contain 78 single rooms with en-suite facilities and a new common room. This is in addition to 42 single rooms, with shared bathroom and cooking facilities, in St Catherine&#x27;s House, which is off-site on Bath Street.

==Student life==
St Catherine&#x27;s has one of the largest undergraduate and graduate intakes among Oxford colleges, admitting 215 graduate students in the 2018–2019 academic year. There is a college bar, as well as a Junior Common Room (JCR) and a Middle Common Room (MCR), which was relocated to the Ainsworth Graduate Centre in 2020 (it was previously located in the Bernard Sunley building).

The JCR is run by a committee of 25 undergraduate students, led by the President and elected by the rest of the student body through &#x27;hustings&#x27;, or a general Q&amp;A (question and answer) session. The committee fulfills a wide range of duties, aimed at organising events, such as Freshers&#x27; week, and providing support to the students. Open meetings are held fortnightly, during which people discuss how to improve the JCR. All undergraduate members are automatically members of the JCR, unless they expressly state that they wish not to be. Honorary membership is also rarely extended to others, with one awarded every five years: honorary members include Robbie Williams and Bradley Walsh. The Catz JCR is financially independent from the College, following a financial committee meeting. Similarly, the MCR is composed of graduate students, visiting postgraduate students, fourth-year undergraduate students and mature (over the age of 21) full-time undergraduate students, who also have JCR membership. It is run by a committee led by two co-presidents, which organises several events such as an annual garden party. The MCR also has benefits, such as a separate kitchen and the exclusive use of an enclosed garden.

The college celebrates its patron saint each year with a special Catz Night dinner, attended by junior and senior members of the college. Every three years the college also holds a ball, usually off-site due to the problem of securing the college&#x27;s perimeter sufficiently for insurance purposes. St Catherine&#x27;s is also known for its more modern approaches, such as by not usually requiring students to wear gowns for dinners and voting to end the tradition of standing when the Master enters the hall at formal dinner, although most students still continue in this practice out of respect. The College also holds fortnightly social events called &#x27;Entz&#x27;, which are usually themed and hosted in the JCR and bar, and an annual Catz Artz Week which showcases creative talents.

The college also has several sport, music and other facilities available on the college site, including squash courts, pool tables, a free gymnasium, a punt house, and theatres. The music house on site is equipped with a grand piano and harpsichord. There are also several clubs and societies available, such as the music society, orchestras, choirs, and subject societies. The dramatic society often performs plays and musicals, including recent adaptations of Rent and Chicago. St Catz has a friendly college rivalry with Magdalen, expressed in sports and in a joke JCR &#x27;declaration of war&#x27; in 2013.

=== Accommodation ===
The college is able to offer three-year accommodation for students, with all first years on site. Most first and third years live in the Jacobsen-designed &#x27;Old Quad&#x27;, the original buildings, while the second years live in the &#x27;New Quad&#x27;, built during the 1995–2005 extensions. There is a kitchen in every corridor, generally shared between eight to ten people. Bathrooms containing four showers and two toilets are shared between groups of ten people in the Old Quad, while every bedroom in the New Quad is en-suite. Rooms are allocated randomly for first year students, while groups of four to six students in second- and third-year ballot together for rooms. All rooms cost the same in rent.

===Academic reputation===

In 2019, the college ranked 2nd in the Norrington Table, with a score of 77.93% and with 68 out of 145 total Finalists achieving first-class honours. In 2018, the college ranked 3rd with a score of 78.15% and with around 50% of Finalists achieving first-class honors, climbing from 26th place in 2017 when it had a score of 68.68%.

=== Scholarships, awards and outreach ===
The College offers several college prizes and research grants. All College scholarships and prizes are awarded based on academic, social and/or cultural contributions. For instance, the Hart Prize is awarded for the best essay for a historical subject, the Thomas Jefferson Prize is awarded to the North American student who has contributed most to the College, and the Smith Award is awarded for services to drama or music.

The College also awards the Wallace Watson Scholarship each year, one of the most prestigious and generous research and travel scholarships at the University of Oxford. The Wallace Watson Scholarship enables undergraduate and graduate students to undertake research fieldwork or remote travel during their time at Oxford. Additionally, the college offers the Emilie Harris Award for those aiming to help or work with the under-privileged communities, the Antony Edwards Bursary for Spanish cultural or language studies, and the Patricia Knapp Travel Award for travel with a medical purpose.

The College is also involved in many fully-funded outreach programmes, such as the Catalyst Programme, which is a sustained contact model during which schools may visit the college and outreach staff may provide workshops on applications, picking A-Levels and exploring careers. The purpose of the programme is to increase the success rate of applicants. The College also has ties with Northern Ireland through the Northern Ireland Residential Summer School, which allow Northern Irish students to visit the college and experience life as an Oxford students, while teachers may have a Q&amp;A session with tutors. The College also has partnerships with several other schemes and charities, such as Target Oxbridge, UNIQ and the Pathways Programme.

===Rowing===
St Catherine&#x27;s College Boat Club is the rowing club of the college. British Olympic gold medallists Sir Matthew Pinsent and Andrew Triggs Hodge, and silver medallist Colin Smith all rowed for the college.

=== In popular culture ===
St Catherine&#x27;s College has served as a filming location for several films and television series. It featured as &#x27;Lovelace College&#x27; in Season 4 of the British crime series &quot;Endeavour&quot;. The British spy drama &quot;Chokepoint&quot; was filmed in locations around the College, such as the SCR and the Bernard Sunley Building. Director SG Smith said it was a good location as the college was &quot;a good fit with the overall aesthetic of the show&quot;. In Season 4, episode 6 of &quot;The Crown&quot;, the Hall at St Catherine&#x27;s serves as the venue of a state reception in Hobart, Tasmania, attended by Prince Charles and Princess Diana in their 1983 tour of Australia.

<text>St Cross College, known colloquially as StX, is a constituent college of the University of Oxford in England. Founded in 1965, St Cross is a graduate college with gothic and traditional-style buildings on a central site in St Giles&#x27;, just south of Pusey Street. It aims to match the structure, life and support of undergraduate colleges.

==History==
St Cross College was formally set up as a society by the University on 5 October 1965; it was to admit its first graduate students (five in number) in the following year. Like the majority of Oxford&#x27;s newer colleges, St Cross has been co-educational since its foundation.

The early location of St Cross was on a site in , immediately south of St Cross Church. The college took its name from its proximity to these places. In 1976 negotiations began between the college and the members of Pusey House over the possibility of moving the college to the St Giles site. The negotiations were successful, and in 1981 the college moved from St Cross Road into a site owned by Pusey House for a leased period of 999 years. The old site on St Cross Road continued to be used, initially by the Centre for Islamic Studies (at that time an Associated Centre of the college), and then subsequently in the early 1990s the site was developed by the college in collaboration with Brasenose College. The site now houses two residential buildings, which were opened in 1996.

On 18 November 2010, it was announced that Sir Mark Jones, previously Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, had been elected as the next Master of the college; he took up the post in September 2011. Unlike every other college head (except the presidents of Kellogg and Reuben), the Master of St Cross is appointed not by the college&#x27;s governing body but by the University Council. Therefore, the election has only the character of a recommendation to Council, albeit one which is constantly followed.

In May 2016, it was announced that the Fellows of St Cross College had elected Carole Souter, then chief executive of the National Heritage Memorial Fund and Heritage Lottery Fund, as the next Master of the college. In September 2016, she succeeded Sir Mark Jones, who had been Master of St Cross since 2011. In June 2022 it was announced that Souter would retire in September 2022. In 2023, Kate Mavor was announced as the new master of the college, with effect from September 2023.

==Buildings==
The college is located on St Giles&#x27; near to the Ashmolean Museum, south of Regent&#x27;s Park College and immediately north of Blackfriars, and faces St John&#x27;s College. It is close to the Classics Faculty and the Oriental Institute.

The college buildings are structured around two quads, the Richard Blackwell Quadrangle and the new West Quad. St Cross shares the site with Pusey House, which comprises the first floor and parts of the ground floor to the eastern side of the Blackwell quad, a library on the first floor on its western side, as well as the chapel. The original Pusey House buildings around the Blackwell quad, including the chapel, date from the period of 1884 to 1926 and are mainly the work of the architects Temple and Leslie Moore and Ninian Comper. Discreet internal alterations were made when St Cross moved in by Geoffrey Beard and the Oxford Architects Partnership. Among these was the conversion of a cloister and store rooms into the Saugman Hall (now the Saugman Common Room) named after Per Saugman, a former director of Blackwell Scientific Publications and a former fellow of the college. The first quadrangle was named the Richard Blackwell Quadrangle in honour of Richard Blackwell (another former fellow); both Saugman and Blackwell played a crucial part in securing the large Blackwell benefaction for St Cross. Most students, however, used to refer to the Richard Blackwell Quadrangle by its nickname: &#x27;the Quad&#x27;. After completion of the second quad, it is now commonly known as &#x27;the front Quad&#x27;.

At the west side of the Blackwell Quad lies the Four Colleges Arch, named after the four colleges which had contributed especially generous capital and recurrent funding to St Cross: Merton, All Souls, Christ Church, and St John&#x27;s. Behind the Four Colleges Arch originally lay a large open garden bordered by medieval boundary wall. This offered the college the possibility of expanding its buildings and erecting a second quadrangle, the West Quad.

Work was first completed on the South Wing on the southern side of the West Quad, containing a hall and kitchen, with bar, the Ian Skipper conference room, and the Caroline Miles games room below, a guest room and study bedrooms above. This development has in part been financed by Ian Skipper, Domus fellow of the college, after whom the conference room on the lower ground floor was named.

A second building to the western and northern sides of the West Quad was set to be completed in time for the college&#x27;s semicentennial in 2015. However, planning permission for the new building was rejected, as it required the demolition of a medieval boundary wall, an action which the council qualified as &#x27;unjustifiable&#x27;. Planning permission was subsequently granted following an appeal, and the new West Wing building was completed in 2017. The new West Quad includes 50 student bedrooms, a lecture theatre, a library with a garden room (the Douglas and Catherine Wigdor Library), several seminar rooms, and the Audrey Blackman Guest Room. Soon after it opened, cracks in the glassfibre reinforced concrete window surrounds appeared, which were found not to have been manufactured to specification and required quality. The building subsequently closed for replacement with a different material, and should reopen in 2023.

In addition to the current main site, the college still owns its original site on St Cross Road, located near the Law Faculty and English Faculty. After the college moved to its present location, this site was developed into student accommodation, the St Cross Annexe. The site is shared with Brasenose, who also own an annexe on the site. Additional buildings which are run by St Cross College as student accommodation include Bradmore Road House, Stonemason House, and the Wellington Square houses.

The master&#x27;s lodgings are also located in Wellington Square.

==Academia==
In 2016, St Cross had over 550 graduate students, studying for degrees in all subjects. There is a strong emphasis on international diversity, with regularly over 75% of the students coming from outside the UK (2016: 83%). This is reflected in the college motto &quot;Ad quattuor cardines mundi&quot;, meaning &#x27;to the four corners of the earth&#x27;. The fellowship is similarly diverse and represents a broad range of academic disciplines in the sciences and the arts.

The college awards a number of scholarships in different subjects, predominantly in the humanities and social sciences.

==Student life==
Students are admitted and matriculated according to the same admissions procedures as the other colleges and halls of the University of Oxford. Unusually for an Oxford college, there is a founding tradition of sharing social facilities between fellows, members of Pusey House, the Common Room and students, with no separate high table or Senior Common Room.

The college has a social calendar for both current students and alumni. There are a range of college societies and sports teams (often in collaboration with other colleges), as well as weekly academic seminars and annual conferences.

Some students are provided with accommodation in the first year of study. College students have the opportunity to participate in a variety of extra-curricular activities. There are sports teams in football, rowing, netball and basketball as well as opportunities to play other sports for other Oxford colleges.

The college&#x27;s Boat Club shared with Wolfson College is like many other college boat clubs competes both within the university itself and in external competitions. The St Cross has a women&#x27;s football team which became Cuppers Champions in 2015.

Other events in the college include regular formal hall, a feast once a term, &#x27;bops&#x27; (informal college-based parties) and a yearly ball. St Cross was the first Oxford college to officially celebrate Chinese New Year. Reunion events for alumni are hosted by the college annually both in Oxford itself and abroad.

The Common Room also provides arts activities, such as an annual play and pantomime, as well as several social societies. The cafe/bar area is a large oak-panelled room, including leather sofas, a TV, a sound system for bi-termly parties (bops), a football table. There is also a free DVD rental library. During Trinity Term, croquet and Pimms are enjoyed on the quad.

==Administration==
Together with Kellogg and Reuben, St Cross is one of only three Oxford colleges without a royal charter. It is officially a society of the university rather than an independent college. The main difference from an independent college is that the governing body only recommends a Master, who is then appointed by Council; in other colleges, the head of house is elected and appointed by the governing body directly. For accounting purposes, the societies are considered departments of the university. St Cross has one of the smallest endowments of any Oxford college, at approximately £8 million. Nevertheless, the college has several scholarships that it awards to current and prospective graduate students and that are funded by third party donations and alumni.

==Traditions==

===Grace===
The college grace is:

===Egalitarianism===

Unlike most colleges, St Cross does not divide its common rooms between senior and middle members. All facilities are open to everyone, students and fellows alike. There is no High Table in the dining hall, and, at formal meals, the Master and Fellows sit amongst the students in the dining hall (which seats 120 people across 3 long tables), with the master normally sitting at the centre of the top table.

== Controversy ==
Peter Thompson, a Sydney L. Mayer Associate Professor of American History at St Cross College and a member of its Executive Committee, was accused of sexual harassment by former students, which came to light in 2021 after Al Jazeera investigation. He has also been the subject of complaints by members of the Faculty of History in 2017, who claimed he was unfit to teach. After an internal investigation by the university, Thompson has agreed not to attend any events or have any contact with students after the allegations of sexual harassment were upheld against him. However, Thompson broke that agreement. Thompson remained a Fellow at the St Cross until December 2024.

<text>St Hilda&#x27;s College (full name = Principal and Council of St. Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford) is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England. The college is named after the Anglo-Saxon saint Hilda of Whitby and was founded in 1893 as a hall for women; it remained a women&#x27;s college until 2008. St Hilda&#x27;s was the last single-sex college in the university as Somerville College had admitted men in 1994. The college now has almost equal numbers of men and women at both undergraduate and postgraduate level.

The principal of the college is Professor Sarah Springman, who took office in 2022.

As of 2018, the college had an endowment of £52.1 million and total assets of £113.4 million.

==History==
St Hilda&#x27;s was founded by Dorothea Beale (who was also a headmistress at Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College) in 1893, as St Hilda&#x27;s Hall and recognised by the Association for the Education of Women as a women&#x27;s hall in 1896. It was founded as a women&#x27;s college, a status it retained until 2008. Whilst other Oxford colleges gradually became co-educational, no serious debate at St Hilda&#x27;s occurred until 1997, according to a former vice-principal, and then the debate solely applied to the issue of staff appointments. After a vote on 7 June 2006 by the Governing Body, men and women can be admitted as fellows and students. This vote was pushed through with a narrow margin and followed previous unsuccessful votes. This led to protests from students because of the &quot;high-handed&quot; manner in which they were held.

In October 2007 a supplemental charter was granted and in 2008 male students were admitted to St Hilda&#x27;s for the first time. The college now has almost equal numbers of men and women at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. In August 2018, the interim Norrington Table showed that 98 per cent of St Hilda&#x27;s finalist undergraduates obtained at least a 2.i in their degree.&lt;ref name=&quot;2017/18 Interim Norrington Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women&#x27;s rowing===

St Hilda&#x27;s was the first 
women&#x27;s college in Oxford and Cambridge to create a women&#x27;s VIII in 1911. It was St Hilda&#x27;s student H.G. Wanklyn who formed OUWBC and coxed in the inaugural Women&#x27;s Boat Race of 1927, with five Hilda&#x27;s rowers.
In 1969, the St Hilda&#x27;s Eight made Oxford history when they became the first ever female crew to row in the Summer Eights. They placed 12th.

===Documentary===
St Hilda&#x27;s students were the subject of the Channel 4 documentary series &quot;College Girls&quot;, broadcast in 2002.

==Buildings and grounds==
The college is located at the eastern end of the High Street, Oxford, over Magdalen Bridge, in Cowley Place, making it the only University of Oxford college lying east of the River Cherwell. It is the most conveniently situated Oxford college for the Iffley Road Sports Complex, a focus for Oxford University Sport.

===Buildings===
Its grounds include six major buildings, which contain student accommodation, teaching areas, dining hall, the library and administration blocks. The first building occupied by the hall was Cowley House built by Humphrey Sibthorp. Together with later extensions it is now known as Hall. In 1921 the hall acquired the lease of Cherwell Hall, now known as South, which was originally Cowley Grange, a house built by A. G. Vernon Harcourt. The lease of Milham Ford, a former school between Hall and South, was acquired in 1958. More recent additions are Wolfson (opened in 1964), Garden (by Alison and Peter Smithson, opened in 1971), and the Christina Barratt Building (opened in 2001). In autumn 2020, a new Boundary Building replaced some of the older buildings, while Milham Ford, which was demolished in 2018, was replaced by a new riverside &quot;Pavilion&quot;. The college also owns a number of properties on Iffley Road, and in the Cowley area.

===The Jacqueline du Pré Music Building===
The Jacqueline du Pré Music Building (JdP) is a concert venue named after the famous cellist who was an honorary fellow of the college. The JdP was the first purpose-built concert hall to be built in Oxford since the Holywell Music Room in 1742. Built in 1995 by van Heyningen and Haward Architects, it houses the Steinway-equipped Edward Boyle Auditorium and a number of music practice rooms. In 2000 the architects designed a new, enlarged foyer space; a lean-to glass structure along the front elevation to the existing music building. In addition to frequent recitals presented by the St Hilda&#x27;s Music Society, the JdP also hosts concerts by a number of world-renowned performers. Musicians who have performed in the JdP in recent years include Steven Isserlis, the Jerusalem Quartet, the Chilingirian Quartet and the Belcea Quartet. The building has also been used for amateur dramatic performances; since 2008, St Hilda&#x27;s College Drama Society have been producing several plays a year in the Edward Boyle Auditorium.

===The Kathleen Major Library===
The original library was held within Hall Building but was limited in space and offerings. In 1909, a new basement wing was opened, and more resources began to be added to collections. The college&#x27;s second principal, Christine Mary Elizabeth Burrows, known as Miss Burrows, is credited with compiling the first catalogue for the library; thus, St. Hilda&#x27;s first library was named for her. The building saw two more expansions and was completed in 1935, though renovations and expansions would continue through to today. The library was renamed in 2005 for Kathleen Major, former librarian and president of the college, and pioneer of the archive profession.

The library currently holds approximately 70,000 books covering all undergraduate subjects. The library offers specialised collections intended for use by research students, including medieval history and literature and women&#x27;s studies. The library holds the St. Hilda&#x27;s College Archives in physical and digital formats. Notable items in the archive include letters from the college founder, Dorothea Beale, and other artifacts pertaining to early women&#x27;s education at the university. The library also holds a rare books collection of approximately 700 items with content ranging from the 15th century to today. Many of the items in the rare books collection were donated by Dorothea Beale. College archives and rare books collections are held in a secure, temperature- and humidity-controlled facility. Other collections offered at the library include popular fiction, culinary books, and travel books.

The library has three floors, seven reading rooms, and 150 study spaces, and has desktop computers as well as a printer, scanner, and photocopier. The main reading room has an art gallery, as well as views of the River Cherwell and the Oxford spires.

===Grounds===
The college grounds stretch along the banks of the River Cherwell, with many college rooms overlooking the river and playing fields beyond. The college has its own fleet of punts, which students of the college may use free of charge in summer months. Unfortunately, this location at times led to problems with flooding in the former Milham Ford building.

<text>St Hugh&#x27;s College is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford. It is located on a site on St Margaret&#x27;s Road, to the north of the city centre. It was founded in 1886 by Elizabeth Wordsworth as a women&#x27;s college, and accepted its first male students in its centenary year in 1986. Prominent alumni include Theresa May, Aung San Suu Kyi, Amal Clooney and Heather Hallett, Baroness Hallett. It enjoys a reputation as one of the most attractive colleges because of its extensive gardens.

In its 125th anniversary year, the college became a registered charity under the name &quot;The Principal and Fellows of St Hugh&#x27;s College in the University of Oxford&quot;. As of July 2023, the college&#x27;s financial endowment was £39.2 million.

== History ==

=== Founding and early years ===
St Hugh&#x27;s was founded in 1886 by Elizabeth Wordsworth (great-niece of the poet William Wordsworth) as a women&#x27;s college. A large percentage of the young women who came to St Hugh&#x27;s in the early years were the daughters of clergymen; most of the other fathers were professional, middle-class men. Its purpose was &quot;to make it possible for women of modest means to live and study in Oxford...with religious teachings (Church of England) on the same lines as Lady Margaret Hall&quot; of which Elizabeth Wordsworth had been founding principal. Using money left to her by her father Christopher Wordsworth, who had been Bishop of Lincoln, Wordsworth established the new college at 25 Norham Road in North Oxford. She named the college after one of her father&#x27;s 12th-century predecessors, Hugh of Lincoln, who was canonised in 1220, and in whose diocese Oxford had been.

The college was initially accommodated in properties in Norham Road, Norham Gardens and Fyfield Road. The first principal being Charlotte Anne Moberly, its first students were Jessie Annie Emmerson, Charlotte Jourdain, Constance E. Ashburner, Wilhelmina J. de Lorna Mitchell and Grace J. Parsons. Students were required to ask the principal before accepting invitations to visit friends, and the college gates were locked at 9pm. Records show that rent was between £18 and £21 a term, depending on the size of the room, with fires being charged extra. At first tuition and lectures were arranged by the Association for the Education of Women, the first college tutor being Dora Wylie, appointed around 1898.

The college began to move to its present site in 1913, when it purchased the lease of a house called &quot;The Mount&quot; from the Rev Robert Hartley for £2,500. This house stood on the corner of St Margaret&#x27;s Road and Banbury Road, and the freehold was owned by University College. The house was later demolished to make way for the Main Building of the college, which was constructed between 1914 and 1916 thanks to a gift from Clara Evelyn Mordan; the college&#x27;s new library was named Mordan Hall in her honour. The first book was a copy of Sale&#x27;s translation of the Koran, which was given to the college by the then Bishop of Tokyo. In 1919, J. R. R. Tolkien began to tutor undergraduates at St Hugh&#x27;s, given that the women&#x27;s colleges were in great need of good teachers in their early years, and Tolkien as a married professor (then still not common) was considered suitable, as a bachelor don would not have been.

The college soon took over other properties nearby. The leasehold of 4 St Margaret&#x27;s Road was acquired in 1919; it became the first &quot;College house&quot;. The leasehold of 82 Woodstock Road was donated to the college by Joan Evans in 1924, and 89 Banbury Road was purchased from Lincoln College for £7,000 in 1927. The college obtained the freehold to the main site in 1927, and a year later the first stage of the Mary Gray Allen building was constructed on what had been the tennis courts. The freeholds of 1–4 St Margaret&#x27;s Road and 74–82 Woodstock Road were purchased from St John&#x27;s College in 1931 and 1932 respectively. The college received a royal charter in 1926.

In 1936, to mark 50 years since it was founded, a &quot;Group Portrait&quot; was painted of Evelyn Procter, History Tutor; Edith Wardale, English Language Tutor; Elizabeth Francis, French Tutor; Barbara Gwyer, Principal; and Cecilia Ady, History Tutor by Henry Lamb. In the same year 1 St Margaret&#x27;s Road was demolished, and a new library was built in the Mary Gray Allen building; it was named the Moberly Library after the first principal of the college (the library was extensively renovated between 1999 and 2000 and renamed the Howard Piper Library after a St Hugh&#x27;s alumnus, after his parents made a large donation to the college).

=== Second World War ===
At the outbreak of the Second World War the college site was requisitioned by the military for use as the Hospital for Head Injuries under the directorship of Hugh Cairns, the first Nuffield Professor of Surgery. Brick huts were constructed in the college grounds with space for 300 beds. Between 1940 and 1945, over 13,000 servicemen and women were treated at the college. Advances in medicine discovered at the hospital meant the mortality rate for brain-penetrating injuries fell from 90% to 9%. Staff and students were relocated to Holywell Manor, Savile House and St Hilda&#x27;s College for the duration of the war.

In 1943 the college acquired the leasehold of 72 Woodstock Road (known as The Shrubbery) from Dame Gertrude Whitehead for £1,500. It was used as a club for American soldiers during the war. In 1946, it was leased to the University of Paris as the Maison française d&#x27;Oxford, an Anglo-French educational establishment. One of the cottages in the grounds of number 72 was later leased by Barbara Gwyer after her retirement as principal.

=== 1945 onwards ===
The college buildings were de-requisitioned in 1945. The hospital huts were initially leased as offices to university departments, including the Bureau of Animal Population, the Department of Zoological Field Studies and the Institute of Statistics, before being demolished in 1952. Agnes Headlam-Morley, a fellow of St Hugh&#x27;s, became the first woman to hold a chair at the University of Oxford in 1948.

In 1951 the college purchased the freeholds to 85 and 87 Banbury Road and 9 to 13 Canterbury Road from St John&#x27;s College. In addition, the freehold of The Shrubbery was acquired; this meant the college now owned the freehold of the entire -acre site. The college extended the Main Building in 1958.

The 1960s saw an extensive programme of building work at St Hugh&#x27;s. The Shrubbery was converted into the principal&#x27;s lodgings in 1963. Between 1964 and 1965 the Kenyon Building was constructed to provide accommodation for students (designed by modern architect David Roberts, the building has already been given a heritage listing). This was followed shortly after by the Wolfson Building, which was constructed between 1966 and 1967 and opened by Princess Alexandra and Harold Macmillan in his role as chancellor of the university.

The chapel was renovated in 1980; a new organ was installed. The following year, 78, 80 and 82 Woodstock Road were also renovated. The houses are now named SH Ho House, Ho Tim House and KK Leung House in recognition of the gifts from the three Hong Kong benefactors that funded the renovations.

===Arrival of co-education===
In 1964, New College made a proposal for the admission of women to the men&#x27;s colleges, and by the early 1970s several Oxford colleges had become mixed to a limited degree in this way. In 1979, two women&#x27;s colleges, Lady Margaret Hall and St Anne&#x27;s, reciprocated by admitting men as undergraduates, while St Hugh&#x27;s, which was already employing male college lecturers, decided to admit men as Fellows. Resistance to full co-education was led by those who predicted that it would have severely negative effects on women academics and who saw other advantages in women&#x27;s colleges. Admitting men as undergraduates was first proposed to the governing body in 1980, and there was a majority for it, but it did not secure the required two-thirds majority. The college principal, Rachel Trickett, fought off full co-education at St Hugh&#x27;s for some years, even taking her case to the national newspapers, and it was not finally agreed until 1986. When Trickett retired in 1991, she was succeeded by the first male Principal, Derek Wood.
A new boathouse was constructed for the St Hugh&#x27;s Boat Club (jointly with St Anne&#x27;s and Wadham Colleges) between 1989 and 1990. This was followed by the construction of the Rachel Trickett Building between 1991 and 1992 at a cost of £3.4 million.

=== Present day ===

Between 1998 and 2000 the Maplethorpe Building was constructed; the building contains conference facilities on the ground floor and student accommodation on the upper three floors. The building missed its planned opening date of summer 2000, meaning students had to be accommodated in B&amp;Bs throughout Michaelmas term. In addition, a new main entrance was constructed at the back of the college on Canterbury Road.

Between 1999 and 2000 the library was extensively renovated. It was reopened by Betty Boothroyd and was renamed after Howard Piper, a Maths student of the college who, shortly after graduating, died in a rafting accident. Mordan Hall, an older library, underwent a major refurbishment, reopening in 2007. It was renamed the Patrick Byfield law library, after a law student who made a significant financial contribution to the college.

There are statues of both St Hugh and Elizabeth Wordsworth on the library stairs. These were presented to the college as gifts for its Jubilee in 1936. St Hugh carries a model of Lincoln Cathedral, which would have been very familiar to Elizabeth Wordsworth, and has his other hand resting on the head of a swan, the famous swan of Stow. Elizabeth Wordsworth is depicted wearing her doctoral robes.

St Hugh&#x27;s College celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2011; a summer garden party was attended by over 1,200 guests. Aung San Suu Kyi sent a message to the college, saying &quot;Happy moments are one of the pillars that keep the spirit uplifted during hard times. St Hugh’s and Oxford are inextricable from my happiest memories, those that I could draw on when the beauty of the world seemed dim. I so wish I could be with you at this very moment to relive old joys and to stir up new ones for the future. I would like to thank all my friends for the happiness we shared. To the present students of St Hugh’s I would simply like to say: Make the most of your time in this wonderful place.&quot;

In 2012 the college was sued for allegedly discriminating against the poor by requiring evidence of funds for living costs. St Hugh&#x27;s, which filed defence papers to the court, accepted barring the student on financial grounds, but claimed the measure was necessary to ensure students can complete their studies. The college eventually settled the claim, with the university promising to conduct a review of the Financial Guarantee policy. In September 2013, it was revealed that the university had decided to abolish the Financial Guarantee policy and replace it with a less restrictive &#x27;Financial Declaration&#x27;.

=== Recent development ===
In 2008, the college began a fundraising drive for a new building on the college site. In November 2010, it was confirmed that Hong Kong businessman Dickson Poon had made a £10 million donation to the college for the construction of the Dickson Poon China Centre. The centre houses the university&#x27;s China Studies department, as well as providing accommodation for St Hugh&#x27;s postgraduate students and The Wordsworth Tea Room. The Dickson Poon building was opened by Prince William in September 2014.

== Buildings and location ==

St Hugh&#x27;s occupies a rectangular site in North Oxford. It is bordered by Banbury Road to the east, Woodstock Road to the west, St Margaret&#x27;s Road to the north (the front entrance) and Canterbury Road to the south (the back gate). The gardens of the college cover about ten and a half acres.

The main entrance of the college leads straight into the Main Building, containing accommodation, teaching facilities, the chapel, and the dining hall. As of 2022, the majority of first year students are housed in the Main Building, in addition to the Kenyon Building (named for Kathleen Kenyon). Some first years are housed in the Maplethorpe and Mary Gray Allen Buildings, although the majority within these buildings are second years and finalists. The Rachel Trickett Building (named for a past principal) and 82 Woodstock Road are further used as second and third year accommodation, whilst the Wolfson Building is almost exclusively used for second years. Further finalist accommodation is provided for in houses on Banbury Road. All undergraduate rooms have kitchen access, with the majority sharing bathroom access (barring Maplethorpe and the Rachel Trickett Building, which have en-suite access).

The Wolfson Building became notable across the university as a result of frequent maintenance issues. In response to a 2018 outbreak of rats in the building, the college adopted two cats– Admiral Flapjack and Professor Biscuit. Due to the installation of cat-flaps in 2019, the cats have free roam of the majority of buildings.

== Finances ==
In its 125th anniversary year, the college became a registered charity under the name &#x27;The Principal and Fellows of St Hugh&#x27;s College in the University of Oxford&#x27;. As of July 2018, the college&#x27;s financial endowment was £37.6 million. By comparison, St John&#x27;s college had a financial endowment of £551.5 million.

== Student life ==

The college is big enough to accommodate all its undergraduates for the duration of their studies. There are three large lawns for the use of students all year round. The gardens are also the venue for croquet. There are a wide range of clubs and societies – sporting, academic, and those supporting niche interests, such as horticulture.

The college has Formal Hall—a formal three or four course dinner—once a week. Students wait for Senior Members to come into High Table and Grace is said in Latin by the presiding fellow, usually the Principal, immediately prior to the meal:

=== Junior Common Room ===
As is the practice at all Oxford Colleges that offer undergraduate degrees, the undergraduate body is represented by a committee, known as the JCR Committee. Otherwise, &#x27;JCR&#x27; refers to the physical common room in the college. The JCR was previously known as the Aung San Suu Kyi Junior Common Room, but in 2017 the student body voted to remove her name from the room&#x27;s title.

&quot;The Swan&quot; is a weekly student-managed newspaper.

=== Middle Common Room ===

The college&#x27;s Middle Common Room (MCR) is located on 87 Banbury Road.

=== Choir ===
St Hugh&#x27;s has a choir which sings weekly evensong on Sundays. The choir draws its members from all three common rooms.

The present organ was constructed by the Italian organ-builder Tamburini in 1980. The college offers organ scholarships along with four choral exhibitions each year, and employs a professional organist to oversee the chapel music.

=== St Hugh&#x27;s College Boat Club ===

St Hugh&#x27;s College Boat Club (SHBC) is a rowing club for members of St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford. It is based on the Isis at Boathouse Island, Christ Church Meadow, Oxford. The boat club blazer is blue with white and yellow trim on the cuffs and lapels.

==== History ====
St Hugh&#x27;s College Boat Club has a long and rich history, with notable contributions towards the development and establishment of women&#x27;s rowing at Oxford. The establishment of the Boat Club occurred a few years after the college (originally St Hugh&#x27;s Hall) itself was founded, with the year 1891 being the first record of a boat being owned by the club. The boat was stored at the River Cherwell and only students &quot;who can swim 50 feet&quot; were permitted to use it. Almost 20 years later, the boat club was able to buy and acquire its first boathouse - the Middle Cherwell Boat House.

After three to four decades of building and gathering much needed infrastructure, the quality of training provided by the club improved significantly. This resulted in the Boat Club winning the Inter-College Fresher&#x27;s fours, which signified the potential of the club. However, the next year, due to unforeseen and unknown circumstances, the Boat Club came into financial trouble, unable to operate. It resulted in a temporary lapse in outings as Boat Club members deliberated with the JCR and College on how best to rectify the situation. A solution was reached in 1953, where it was agreed that as long as &quot;half a dozen&quot; of members are active and pay a termly subscription of 15s (75p), then the Boat Club would receive full support from the college. This issue was officially &quot;settled&quot; with the Club restarting its activities in Michaelmas Term of 1953, after acquiring a new boat. Unfortunately, this bout of luck was short-lived as the Boat Club suddenly came into &quot;desperate straits&quot; due to the loss of their only race-worthy boat, before the annual Boat Race against Cambridge. There is not mention of the St Hugh&#x27;s Boat Club after the 1954-55 issue of the St Hugh&#x27;s Chronicle, leading to the assumption that the Boat Club was unable to recover from the loss of their boat.

It is only after one and a half decades later that the Boat club is mentioned again, with its refounding occurring in 1973, thanks to the enthusiasm of Julia Winterbottom, Jennifer Greenwood and Judy Bartley. The newly rejuvenated club boasted 16 members coached by the members of the Brasenose College Boat Club with regular outings scheduled and a growing squad of Blues rowers, aiming to win. This was swiftly proven true two years later, in 1975 where the St Hugh&#x27;s Women&#x27;s First VIII bumped Magdalen M4. The St Hugh&#x27;s W1 became the first and only women&#x27;s boat to successfully bump a men&#x27;s crew, a truly outstanding achievement. This event was the catalyst for the creation of the Women&#x27;s divisions for Summer Eight&#x27;s since 1976, where St Hugh&#x27;s was a strong contender. It was only fours year later in 1979, where St Hugh&#x27;s W1 was able to finally win the Boat Club&#x27;s first Headship. Unfortunately, the crew was unable to hold onto headship and tumbled down the order during 1980-81.

After two years of slipping down the order, the Boat Club was able to pick itself back up again by putting together a highly-talented and trained squad made up of many Blues rowers. This women&#x27;s crew was able to rapidly climb up the ranks, and finally restored the Boat Club to its former glory by winning Headship back again in 1982. This was continued by a string of dominant performances, with the Boat Club retaining Summer Eight&#x27;s headship until 1984. The Boat Club was also able to win Torpids Headship in the Women&#x27;s division in 1986.

<text>St John&#x27;s College is a constituent college of the University of Oxford. Founded as a men&#x27;s college in 1555, it has been coeducational since 1979. Its founder, Sir Thomas White, intended to provide a source of educated Roman Catholic clerics to support the Counter-Reformation under Queen Mary.

St John&#x27;s is the wealthiest college in Oxford, with assets worth over of £790 million as of 2022, largely due to nineteenth-century suburban development of land in the city of Oxford of which it is the ground landlord.

The college occupies a site on St Giles&#x27; and has a student body of some 390 undergraduates and 250 postgraduates. There are over 100 academic staff, and a like number of other staff. In 2018 St John&#x27;s topped the Norrington Table, the annual ranking of Oxford colleges&#x27; final results, and in 2021, St John&#x27;s ranked second with a score of 79.8.

==History==

On 1 May 1555, Sir Thomas White, lately Lord Mayor of London, obtained a Royal Patent of Foundation to create a charitable institution for the education of students within the University of Oxford. White, a Roman Catholic, originally intended St John&#x27;s to provide a source of educated Roman Catholic clerics to support the Counter-Reformation under Queen Mary, and indeed Edmund Campion, the Roman Catholic martyr, studied here.

White acquired buildings on the east side of St Giles&#x27;, north of Balliol and Trinity Colleges, which had belonged to the former College of St Bernard, a monastery and house of study of the Cistercian order that had been founded in 1437 and closed in 1540 during the dissolution of the monasteries. The grant also included half of the grove of Durham College, which had likewise been suppressed and whose buildings had become Trinity College. Initially the new St John&#x27;s College was rather small and not well endowed financially. During the reign of Elizabeth I the fellows lectured in rhetoric, Greek, and dialectic, but not directly in theology. However, St John&#x27;s initially had a strong focus on the creation of a proficient and educated priesthood.

White was Master of the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company, and established a number of educational foundations, including the Merchant Taylors&#x27; School. Although the college was closely linked to such institutions for many centuries, it became a more open society in the later 19th century. (Closed scholarships for students from the Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, however, persisted until the late 20th century. As well as these, scholarships existed for students from Christ&#x27;s Hospital, two for Coventry School, two for Bristol Grammar School, two for Reading School and one for Tonbridge School.) Female students were first admitted in 1979, after over four centuries of the college as an institution for men only. Elizabeth Fallaize was appointed as the first female fellow in 1990.

Although primarily a producer of Anglican clergymen in the earlier periods of its history, St John&#x27;s also gained a reputation for degrees in law, medicine and PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics).

===Endowments===
The endowments which St John&#x27;s was given at its foundation, and during the twenty or so years afterward, served it very well and in the second half of the nineteenth century it benefited, as ground landlord, from the suburban development of the city of Oxford and was unusual among colleges for the size and extent of its property within the city. The patronage of the parish of St Giles was included in the endowment of the college by Thomas White. Vicars of St Giles were formerly either fellows of the college, or ex-fellows who were granted the living on marriage (when Oxford fellows were required to be unmarried). The college retains the right to present candidates for the benefice to the bishop. Today St John&#x27;s maintains the largest endowment of the Oxford colleges, for example owning the Oxford Playhouse building and the Millwall F.C. training ground.

In January 2020, students carried out a five-day occupation on the college&#x27;s front quad to protest against the endowment fund&#x27;s continued investments in fossil fuels.

==Buildings==
The college is situated on a single site. Most of the college buildings are organised around seven quadrangles (quads).

===Front Quadrangle===

The Front Quadrangle mainly consists of buildings built for the Cistercian St Bernard&#x27;s College. Construction started in 1437, though when the site passed to the crown in 1540, due to the dissolution of the monasteries, much of the exterior was as it is now, but the Eastern range was incomplete. Christ Church took control of the site in 1546 and Thomas White acquired it in 1554. He made major alterations to create the current college hall, and designated the Northern part of the Eastern range as the lodging of the president, for which it is still used today. Front Quad was gravelled until the college&#x27;s 400th anniversary when the current circular lawn and paving were laid out.

The turret clock, made by John Knibb, dates from 1690. The main tower above the Porters&#x27; Lodge features a statue of John the Baptist by Eric Gill.

====Chapel====

The chapel was built in 1530, dedicated to St Bernard of Clairvaux. It was re-dedicated to St John the Baptist in 1557. The Baylie chapel in the north-east corner was added 1662–69 and refitted in 1949. In 1840 the interior of the chapel&#x27;s underwent major changes which created the gothic revival pews, roof, wall arcading and west screen. Thomas White, William Laud and William Juxon are buried beneath the chapel. All three were presidents of the college, with the latter two also holding the office of Archbishop of Canterbury. To the south of the chancel is a hidden pew directly accessible from the President&#x27;s Lodgings, which historically allowed the only woman in college, the president&#x27;s wife, to worship without distracting college members.

Choral services have been sung in the chapel since 1618. Orlando Gibbons&#x27;s famous anthem &quot;This Is the Record of John&quot; was written at the college&#x27;s request, and presumably received its first performance here. The college in 1620 commissioned the anthem &quot;As they departed&quot; from Michael East. The college choir today sings evensong services on Sundays and Wednesdays during term time, as well as singing the grace at Sunday formal hall. Since 1923 the choir has been directed by student organ scholars. The chapel has always held an organ. The present three-manual instrument by Bernard Aubertin was installed in 2008.

===Canterbury Quadrangle===
This quad is the first example of Italian Renaissance architecture in Oxford. It was substantially commissioned by Archbishop Laud and completed in 1636.

The college library is here, consisting of four connected parts: The Old Library (south side, built 1596–1598), The Laudian Library (built 1631–1635 above the eastern colonnade, overlooking the garden), The Paddy Room (1971–77) and the new Library and Study Centre, designed by Wright &amp; Wright Architects and opened in 2019. Until moving to the Kendrew Quadrangle in 2010, the Holdsworth Law Library was situated in the neighbouring southwest corner of Canterbury Quadrangle. The college holds Robert Graves&#x27; Working Library and in 1936 it acquired the &#x27;A. E. Housman Classics Library&#x27;, consisting of about 300 books and pamphlets containing hand-written notes by Housman in margins and on loose leaves.

The Holmes Building is a 1794 south spur off the Canterbury Quad, containing fellows&#x27; rooms.

===North Quadrangle===
The North Quadrangle was not designed as a whole, but is the irregular product of a series of buildings constructed since the college&#x27;s foundation.

In 1612 the college’s cook, Thomas Clarke, was given permission to build a college kitchen, with residential rooms above. The college bought this building, just north of the hall, from Clarke in 1620 and expanded it during 1642–1643 to produce the current Cook&#x27;s Building.

In 1676 the first part of today&#x27;s Senior Common Room was constructed, just north of the chapel. Its ceiling, completed in 1742, features the craftsmanship of Thomas Roberts, who also worked on the Radcliffe Camera and the Codrington Library. Various additions and renovations took place in 1826, 1900, 1936 and 2004–2005. The latest renovation and extension to the Grade I listed building was by MJP Architects and received two awards in 1996, the Design Partnership Award from the National Association of Shopfitters, and the other from the Royal Institute of British Architects.

In 1742 property was bought from Exeter College and between 1794 and 1880 was used for college purposes, known as the Wood Buildings. It was replaced when in 1880 the construction of today&#x27;s St Giles&#x27; range began. What is today thought of as a single building was constructed as several distinct sections. The first part (1880–1881) consisted of the gate tower and the rooms between it and Cook&#x27;s building to the south. The second part to be constructed (1899–1900) forms the northern half of the St Giles&#x27; range. Finally the Rawlinson Building (1909) formed the northern side of the quadrangle. More rooms were added by Edward Maufe in 1933.

With completion of the &quot;Beehive&quot; (1958–1960), made up of irregular hexagonal rooms, the quadrangle took on its current appearance. The Beehive was designed by Michael Powers of the Architects&#x27; Co-Partnership and is clad in Portland stone. This Eastern part of the quadrangle previously held the old Fellows&#x27; Stables.

===Dolphin Quadrangle===
Three houses at 2–4 St Giles&#x27; formed the Dolphin Inn. When demolished in 1881 the houses were known as the South Buildings, and used as college accommodation. In 1947–48 the college constructed, at a cost of £43,216, the neo-Georgian Dolphin Quadrangle on the site. It was designed by Edward Maufe. There was a shortage of construction materials in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, but the college built the new quadrangle with its own timber, stored in Bagley Wood, still owned by the college.

===Sir Thomas White Quadrangle===
Built in 1972–1975, this is not actually a quadrangle, but an L-shaped building partially enclosing an area of garden. The upper floors are predominantly student residences, but ground floor contains communal facilities including the college bar, TV room, DVD room and JCR. Underground areas contain the Games Room and Erg Room for rowing. The Prestwich, Larkin and Graves rooms are multi-purpose and used for a variety of events.

The building is an early design by Philip Dowson of Arup Associates which won both the 1976 Concrete Society Award and the 1981 Royal Institute of British Architects architectural excellence award. It was also Commended in the 2011 Mature Building Category of the Construct: Concrete Awards and became a Grade II listed building in 2017.

===Garden Quadrangle===

The Garden Quadrangle is a modern (1993) neo-Italianate design from MJP Architects that includes the college auditorium, student rooms and kitchens. The complex structure is very unlike a conventional quadrangle. After it won five awards (RIBA Award 1995, Civic Trust Award 1995, Oxford Preservation Trust Award 1994, &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; Building of the Year 1994 and Concrete Society Award – Overall Winner 1994), a 2003 poll organised by &quot;The Oxford Times&quot; voted the £7.5m quadrangle the best building erected in Oxford in the preceding 75 years.

The site was previously occupied by the Department of Agriculture, and the Parks Road frontage of this building survives today, separated from the quadrangle by a detached building containing three music rooms.

===Kendrew Quadrangle===
The most recent quad, completed in 2010, was also designed by MJP architects. The quad is named after Sir John Kendrew, former president of the college, Nobel Laureate and the college&#x27;s greatest benefactor of the twentieth century. The construction has been dubbed &quot;the last great quad in the city centre&quot; and is notable for its attempt to provide energy from sustainable sources: much of the energy required to heat the building is provided by a combination of solar panels on the roof, geothermal pipes extending deep below the basement and woodchips from the college wood used to fire the boilers.

As the first phase of The Kendrew Quadrangle project Dunthorne Parker Architects were appointed by the college to refurbish three Grade II Listed buildings fronting on to St Giles. Works were carried out to No 20 St Giles which became alumni residential accommodation, The Black Hall, a 17th-century building, which became teaching accommodation and The Barn, which became an exhibition and performance space.

===College properties on Eastern side of St Giles&#x27;===

The college now owns almost all the buildings on the Eastern stretch of St Giles&#x27;. Most of these are fairly unnoticeable, with various previous owners, today all used for various college purposes. However a few are more distinctive.

Middleton Hall is a curious house, north of the North Quad and abutting the Lamb &amp; Flag.

Number 16 is St Giles&#x27; House, which dates from 1702. It was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as &quot;the best house of its date in Oxford&quot;. It was previously known as The Judge&#x27;s Lodgings, due to its use between 1852 and 1965 by the judge when visiting for Assizes. It is today used by the college for dinners and receptions, with the upper levels including various rooms for tutors.

The Lamb &amp; Flag pub is owned by the college which up to 2021 operated it, using the profits to fund graduate scholarships.

===Western side of St Giles&#x27;===
The college owns a stretch of the Western side of St Giles&#x27;, including (until its sale by the college in 2023) The Eagle and Child pub (formerly owned by University College, Oxford), where the well-known writers J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis often met their literary friends.

==Student life==
===Facilities===
St John&#x27;s offers onsite accommodation to all undergraduates for the duration of their course (although students are not obliged to take up this offer). For first years, this is mostly in the Thomas White Quad, with some students also accommodated in the Beehive. The college also accommodates some undergraduates (mostly second years) in houses owned by the college on Museum Road, with some postgraduates in Blackhall Road.

===Middle Common Room===
All graduate students are members of the Middle Common Room. The MCR represents graduates in the college, organises events and maintains graduate facilities. The MCR building was completed in 1998.

===Societies===
St John&#x27;s College Boat Club (SJCBC) is the largest of a number of college sports clubs. In Summer Eights 2013, eight SJCBC boats qualified for the racing, and the women&#x27;s 1st VIII bumped up to become the Head of the River - the first time any crew from SJCBC has achieved this in the club&#x27;s 150-year history. The women&#x27;s 1st Torpid won blades three years in succession from 2011 to 2013, and in 2013 also won the right to represent the Oxford colleges in the women&#x27;s intercollegiate race at the Henley Boat Races.

In 2006 St John&#x27;s launched SJCtv, becoming the first Oxford college to start its own television station. The college drama group operates under the banner of &quot;St John&#x27;s Mummers&quot;. In addition to the chapel choir, the college regularly hosts performances from professional musicians and two non-auditioning ensembles (open to all Oxford students) rehearse in college: the &quot;Oxford Open Orchestra&quot; and &quot;Oxford University Symphonic Band&quot;.

<text>St Peter&#x27;s College is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford. Located on New Inn Hall Street, Oxford, United Kingdom, it occupies the site of two of the university&#x27;s medieval halls dating back to at least the 14th century. The modern college was founded by Francis James Chavasse, former Bishop of Liverpool, opened as St Peter&#x27;s Hall in 1929, and achieved full collegiate status as St Peter&#x27;s College in 1961. Founded as a men&#x27;s college, it has been coeducational since 1979.

As of 2023, the college had an estimated financial endowment of £52.8 million.

==History==
===Medieval halls===

Although founded in its current form in the 20th century, St Peter&#x27;s occupies a central Oxford location on the site of two of the university&#x27;s medieval halls. The first Master of St Peter&#x27;s called the acquisition of the site &quot;a chance of ages&quot;.

The site was originally the location of Trilleck&#x27;s Inn, later known as New Inn Hall, and Rose Hall. Trillecks&#x27; Inn was founded in the 14th century by Bishop Trilleck and, as New Inn Hall, merged into Balliol College in 1887. Rose Hall was given to New College by William of Wykeham. New College finally sold the site to the rector of St Peter-le-Bailey in 1859 and 1868 as a site for a new church, now the college chapel.

===St Peter&#x27;s Hall===

The history of the college in its present form began in 1923 when Francis James Chavasse, former Bishop of Liverpool, returned to Oxford. He was concerned at the rising cost of education in the older universities in Britain, and projected St Peter&#x27;s as a college where promising students, who might otherwise be deterred by the costs of college life, could obtain an Oxford education. After Francis James died in 1928, his son Christopher Chavasse launched a memorial appeal in his father&#x27;s name to fund the project, raising £150,000 from donors including Ella Rowcroft to convert and build new buildings on the site. St Peter&#x27;s was licensed by the university as a hostel that year and opened with 13 residents. The following year, 1929, it was recognised as a permanent private hall and grew to 40 students. A later significant benefactor was William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield, who would also found Nuffield College. The hall was sometimes nicknamed &quot;Pot Hall&quot;.

During the Second World War, St Peter&#x27;s Hall became home to evacuated students from Westfield College, a women&#x27;s college of the University of London, and its students were boarded out to other colleges.

===St Peter&#x27;s College===

In 1947, St Peter&#x27;s was reclassified as a &#x27;new foundation&#x27;, and was finally recognised as a full college in 1961 with the granting of a royal charter. In 1979, St Peter&#x27;s started admitting women and became co-educational.

==Buildings==
St Peter&#x27;s has a varied set of buildings, many of them much older than the college itself. The college has, in effect, adapted existing buildings to provide the collective facilities needed for college life, and built new ones to provide student accommodation.

===Linton Quad===
Linton House, a Georgian rectory dating from 1797, stands on the east side of Linton Quad along New Inn Hall Street. It was originally built as the offices for the Oxford Canal Company and called Wyaston House. It was bought in 1878 by Canon Henry Linton who converted it to a rectory for the Church of St Peter-le-Bailey. Now known as Linton House, it serves as the porter&#x27;s lodge (the entrance to the college) and is also home to the college library.

On the south side of the quad stands the college chapel, the Church of St Peter-le-Bailey. Built in 1874 and incorporating some of the stone of an earlier church, it is the third church of that name on or close to the site since the 12th century. Memorials to members of the Chavasse family in the chapel include Captain Noel Chavasse&#x27;s original grave cross, a large bas-relief of Bishop Francis Chavasse at prayer and the Chavasse memorial window.

The quad also includes the Latner building.

===Hannington Quad===
In the Hannington Quad stands Hannington Hall. It dates from 1832 and is the only surviving part of New Inn Hall. The building was originally commissioned by John Cramer, principal of New Inn Hall, as student accommodation and was designed by architect Thomas Greenshields. When New Inn Hall was absorbed by Balliol in 1887 and most of New Inn Hall&#x27;s buildings were demolished to make room for the Central Girls School building (now part of St Peter&#x27;s Chavasse Quad), the Cramer building survived. It was bought by Reverend Talbot Rice, rector of St-Peter-le-Bailey, in 1897 and renamed after the Victorian missionary Bishop James Hannington. After the founding of St Peter&#x27;s it was remodelled to function as the dining hall. 

The quad was formed by the construction of an accommodation block designed by Sir Herbert Baker and Fielding Dodd behind the older buildings.

===Chavasse Quad===
The Central Girls&#x27; School to the South of the original site of the college was designed by Leonard Stokes and completed in 1901. It was converted into the college&#x27;s Chavasse Building between 1984 and 1986 and provides living accommodation for students and seminar rooms. In 2018 the new Hubert Perrodo Building was completed offering further on-site accommodation and conference spaces. The Middle Common Room (MCR) for postgraduates, and a music room are also located in the Pastry School in the quad&#x27;s southwest corner. 

===Mulberry Quad===
The Mulberry Quad lies to the northwest of the Linton and provides for the direct access to the JCR. The Morris Building, currently student accommodation, was given by Lord Nuffield in memory of his mother, Emily Morris. The Matthews block houses the JCR as well as the student-run bar. The Dorfman Centre lies in the northwest corner of the quad. Mulberry Quad also provides access to Bulwarks Lane. 

=== Castle Bailey Quad ===
The Castle Bailey Quad is St Peter&#x27;s latest build, housing 54 undergraduate students across Damazer House (named after former Master, Mark Damazer) and Westfield House (named in honour of the women of Westfield College, London, who relocated to St Peter&#x27;s during World War II). Other support facilities, including Fellow’s Rooms and an estates workshop and office, can be found on the ground floor. Castle Bailey Quad was funded through almost 900 donors and alumni contributions of close to £14m. The quad was officially opened on 15 June 2024 by the then Chancellor, The Rt Hon the Lord Patten of Barnes, KG, CH, PC. 

=== Canal House ===
Canal House, the master&#x27;s lodge, dates from the early 19th century.

===Annexes===
St Peter&#x27;s also has a few off-site accommodation blocks for students, a few minutes away from the main college site. St Thomas&#x27; Street and St George&#x27;s Gate house undergraduates, while Paradise Street (which was officially opened in June 2008) houses postgraduates and fourth-year undergraduates.

==Student life==
The student-run Junior Common Room organises a wide variety of social events throughout the academic year, ranging from formal events to celebrate such things as Burns Night (complete with haggis and poetry) to creatively themed parties that run into the early hours of the morning. The college is one of the few to feature its own student-edited arts magazine, &quot;Misc&quot;, which is published termly. The college also has a student-run college bar, which serves the Cross Keys cocktail.

===Sports===
The college has sports teams competing in rowing, cricket, football, hockey, rugby, and pool. It shares with Exeter and Hertford Colleges a sports field which has two cricket pitches and pavilions, two rugby and football pitches, a hockey pitch, tennis courts and a squash court.

The college boat club, St Peter&#x27;s College Boat Club, competes regularly. The club shares a boathouse with Somerville College Boat Club, University College Boat Club and Wolfson College Boat Club.
==Locomotive==
Taking the original name of the college, GWR 6959 Class steam locomotive no. 7900 was built in 1949 for British Railways and named &quot;Saint Peter&#x27;s Hall&quot; (no abbreviation). One of the brass nameplates from the now-scrapped locomotive survives in the college on the far wall of the college bar.

<text>Trinity College (full name: The College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity in the University of Oxford, of the foundation of Sir Thomas Pope (Knight)) is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England. The college was founded in 1555 by Sir Thomas Pope, on land previously occupied by Durham College, home to Benedictine monks from Durham Cathedral.

Despite its large physical size, the college is relatively small in terms of student numbers at approximately 400. It was founded as a men&#x27;s college and has been coeducational since 1979. As of 2023, the total funds of Trinity amounted to more than £224 million, including a financial endowment of £191 million.

Trinity has produced three British prime ministers, placing it third after Christ Church and Balliol in terms of former students who have held that office.

==History==

=== Durham College ===

 The site where Trinity College now stands was originally occupied by Durham College, built for Benedictine monks from Durham Cathedral. This college had been founded after land was bought in 1291, though monks had been sent to Oxford for a few years previous to this. The site was surrendered to the crown in March 1545, being granted to private owners in 1553. They were then acquired by civil servant Thomas Pope on 20 February 1555 (February 1554 as then was), who used them to found Trinity College 16 days later. Durham College was originally dedicated to the Virgin Mary, St Cuthbert, and the Trinity, and it is thought that Trinity College took its name from the last element of this dedication.

===Trinity College===
Trinity College was founded in 1555 by Sir Thomas Pope, on land bought following the abolition of Durham College during the period of Protestant Reformation, whose buildings housed the original foundation. Pope was a Catholic who had no surviving children, and he hoped that by founding a college he would be remembered in the prayers of its students. His remains are still encased beside the chapel altar. The original foundation provided for a president, 12 fellows, and 12 scholars, and for up to 20 undergraduates. The fellows were required to take Holy Orders and to remain unmarried.

The college remained an all-male institution until 1979, when (in common with a number of other Oxford colleges) it admitted its first women undergraduates. It is now fully co-educational and co-residential. Between 2015 and 2017, 41.1% of UK undergraduates admitted to Trinity came from state schools.

Trinity was one of the locations used for filming of the original series &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;; its grounds were also, in part, the basis for Fleet College in Charles Finch&#x27;s &quot;The Last Enchantments&quot;. Trinity has also featured heavily in episodes of &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, &quot;Lewis&quot; and &quot;Endeavour&quot;.

Dame Hilary Boulding, formerly principal of the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, succeeded Sir Ivor Roberts as president in August 2017.

===Trinity–Balliol rivalry===
For many years, there has been a traditional and fierce rivalry shown between the students of Trinity and those of its immediate neighbour to the west, Balliol College. It has manifested itself on the sports field and the river; in the form of songs (of greater or less offensiveness) sung over the dividing walls; and in the form of &quot;raids&quot; on the other college.

In college folklore, the rivalry goes back to the late 17th century, when Ralph Bathurst, president of Trinity, was supposedly observed throwing stones at Balliol&#x27;s windows. In fact, although the first antagonism was recorded in 1583, the rivalry in its modern form appears to date from the late 1890s, when the chant or song known as a &quot;Gordouli&quot; began to be sung from the Balliol side. The traditional words run:

Although these words are now rarely heard, the singing of songs over the wall is still known as &quot;a Gordouli&quot;. The traditional Gordouli is said to have been sung by Balliol and Trinity men in the trenches of Mesopotamia during the First World War.

The rivalry was given an extra edge in the early 20th century by the contrast between the radical tendencies of many Balliol students and Trinity&#x27;s traditional conservatism and social exclusivity. The president of Trinity between 1907 and 1938 was Herbert Blakiston, who became notorious for his reluctance to admit non-white students. Notably, he stubbornly resisted pressure from the India Office to admit undergraduates from British India, something that government department was attempting to promote. Balliol in contrast did admit a number of Indian and Asiatic students which gave many of the taunts from the Trinity side a distinctly racist tone: Balliol students, for example, were sometime referred to as &quot;Basutos&quot;.

In &quot;Five Red Herrings&quot; (1931), a Lord Peter Wimsey novel by Dorothy L. Sayers, Lord Peter (a Balliol man) is asked whether he remembers a certain contemporary from Trinity. &quot;&#x27;I never knew any Trinity men,&#x27; said Wimsey. &#x27;The Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.&#x27;&quot; Sayers also alludes to the rivalry in &quot;Murder Must Advertise&quot; (1933): Mr Ingleby, a Trinity man, comments, &quot;If there is one thing more repulsive than another it is Balliolity.&quot;

One of the wittier raids from Balliol, in 1962 or 1963, involved the turfing of the whole of Trinity JCR (complete with daffodils). One of the most famous incidents was perpetrated by three Trinity students (Richard Todd, Richard Cohen and Deidrie Small) on the new intake of freshers to Balliol in October 1985. They sent personally addressed letters to each of Balliol&#x27;s new freshers on Balliol headed notepaper. It enclosed a narrow neck 100ml screw-top receptacle. The attached letter read, &quot;Dear [X], Welcome to Balliol. As you are aware the university requires a short medical check-up as part of your Coming-Up. Could you therefore please provide a urine sample in the attached sample bottle and return it to your college tutor&#x27;s office by no later than 5.00 PM on Wednesday.&quot; The letters were sent out on that Wednesday evening. Balliol admitted to some 57 being returned. The incident was subsequently reported in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; under the headline, &quot;students play wee joke on neighbours&quot;. The incident concluded with Todd and Cohen unfurling a banner over Balliol reading, &quot;We are Balliol. Please Don&#x27;t Take The Piss!&quot;. The last incident suspected to relate to the feud was the vandalism of Trinity&#x27;s SCR pond in 2010, which led to the death of all but one of the fish.

==Buildings==

The main entrance to the college is on Broad Street, located between Balliol College and Blackwell&#x27;s bookshop, and opposite Turl Street. It is enclosed by an iron palisade rather than a wall, and the college&#x27;s distinctive blue gates provide it with a more open appearance than many others in Oxford. The rear of the college backs onto St John&#x27;s College, and has entrances on both St Giles&#x27; and Parks Road. As well as its four major quadrangles, the college also boasts a large lawn and gardens, which include a small area of woodland.


===Durham Quadrangle===

Trinity College was built around a single quadrangle, now known as the Durham quadrangle, named after Durham College which previously occupied the site of Trinity.

===Chapel===

The chapel, though relatively modest in size compared to some of its Oxford counterparts, was the first college chapel to be designed entirely in the Baroque style. It was thought to be designed by Henry Aldrich, with advice from Christopher Wren, and was consecrated in 1694. The executed design was based on a second print, moderated by Wren, and the previous print, held in the Library of Christ Church, Oxford, showed a different scheme for the west tower and the interior.

On the top of the west tower sit four female statues, which represent Astronomy, Geometry, Medicine and Theology.

===Garden Quadrangle===
In a letter dated June 22, 1665, kept in the Trinity College Archives, Christopher Wren wrote back to the President of the College, Ralph Bathurst that it would be &#x27;lame one... like a threelegged table&#x27; in response to Bathurst&#x27;s suggestion of an open Quadrangle be put up to allow the view of the Fellows&#x27; Garden. 

During Wren&#x27;s absence in Paris, the construction of the initial freestanding building - two-storied accommodation block with a mansard roof (the first one in Oxford) was put up under the direction of Oxfordshire stonemason family, the Townsends between 1665-1668. The west side was added to the same plan in 1682. The mansard roof was pulled down and replaced with the addition of a third storey as the population of Trinity College students grew.

In its current state, the Garden Quad remains faithful to Bathurst&#x27;s original intentions and the addition of the central block, completing the open air quadrangle was probably inspired by William Byrd&#x27;s Garden Quadrangle at New College, Oxford completed between 1682-1702.

===Front Quadrangle===
The front quadrangle between the Durham quadrangle and Broad Street was formed by the new buildings (1883–1885) and the president&#x27;s lodgings (1885–1887), both designed by Thomas Graham Jackson. It also includes some older buildings on Broad Street: four old cottages and Kettell Hall, a stone house built by President Ralph Kettell in around 1620.

===Library Quadrangle===
The library quadrangle is located between Jackson&#x27;s new buildings and the new library of 1925–1928, built as a memorial to members of the college who perished in World War I. The building was designed by architect Mr. J. Osborne Smith, with the ornate barrel roof created by the leading architectural designer Leonard Shuffrey. 

The Cumberbatch buildings to the north and south were designed by Maguire and Murray and built in 1964–1966. The Norrington Room (named after Sir Arthur Norrington, a former president of the college) of Blackwells bookshop lies underneath the quad. 

In 2018 the college gained planning permission for a new building, designed by ADAM Architecture, to the north of the library quadrangle and the university&#x27;s Weston Library and replacing the northern Cumberbatch building. The Levine Building was opened in 2022 and marked the beginning of the overarching transformation of Trinity College.

==Student life==
The college offers accommodation to all undergraduate students. First and second years are housed on the college&#x27;s main site, and third and fourth years in college buildings on the Woodstock Road.

===Chapel Choir===
The Chapel Choir of Trinity College consists of up to eight choral scholars and exhibitioners, and over thirty choral volunteers from across Oxford. It remains as one of the few non-auditioning chapel choirs in Oxford and the majority of its singers are Trinity College students. 

The choir sing a weekly Evensong on a Sunday with occasional weekday services to mark college events such the Founder&#x27;s Day. Unlike many colleges, Trinity College remains in the minority of Oxford colleges with no Director of Music. Thus, the responsibility of overseeing the chapel choir falls to the organ scholars and is overseen by the Chaplain. As of 2023, the organ scholars and choral award-holders are supported by Sarah Tenant-Flowers and Joanna Campion-Watt. Previous choral advisors to the Chapel Choir include Ralph Allwood who was appointed after his directorship at Eton College.

The Chapel Choir has gone on overseas tours annually: tour destinations include Dublin in 2008, where they sang concerts and a Sung Eucharist in St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin, Rome in 2009, Paris in 2010, Barcelona in 2011 and Vienna in 2012. In more recent decade, the Chapel Choir has toured Valencia (2022), Ljubljana (2023) and Lyon (2024), singing concerts and mass at Ljubljana Cathedral and Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière. 

In terms of discography, in 2009, the choir released a CD, called &#x27;A Voice from Afar&#x27;, directed by then-organ scholar, Catherine Wallace.

==Notable alumni==

In over four centuries of its history, Trinity has produced a number of notable students who have led careers in fields such as academia, politics, science, religions and the arts.

<text>University College, formally The Master and Fellows of the College of the Great Hall of the University commonly called University College in the University of Oxford and colloquially referred to as &quot;Univ&quot;, is a constituent college of the University of Oxford in England. It has a claim to being the oldest college of the university, having been founded in 1249 by William of Durham.

As of 2023, the college had an estimated financial endowment of £146.084 million, and their total net assets amounted to £238.316 million.

The college is associated with a number of influential people, including Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson, Bill and Chelsea Clinton, Neil Gorsuch, Stephen Hawking, C. S. Lewis, V. S. Naipaul, Robert Reich, William Beveridge, Bob Hawke, Robert Cecil, Tom Hooper, and Percy Bysshe Shelley.

== History ==
A legend arose in the 14th century that the college was founded by King Alfred in 872. This explains why the college arms are those attributed to King Alfred, why the Visitor is always the reigning monarch, and why the college celebrated its millennium in 1872. Most agree that in reality the college was founded in 1249 by William of Durham. He bequeathed money to support ten or twelve masters of arts studying divinity, and a property which became known as Aula Universitatis (University Hall) was bought in 1253. This later date still allows the claim that Univ is the oldest of the Oxford colleges, although this is contested by Balliol College and Merton College. Univ was open only to fellows studying theology until the 16th century.

The college acquired four properties on its current site south of the High Street in 1332 and 1336 and built a quadrangle in the 15th century. As it grew in size and wealth, its medieval buildings were replaced with the current Main Quadrangle in the 17th century. Although the foundation stone was placed on 17 April 1634, the disruption of the English Civil War meant it was not completed until sometime in 1676. Radcliffe Quad followed more rapidly by 1719, and the library was built in 1861.

Like many of Oxford&#x27;s colleges, University College accepted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979, having previously been an institution for men only.

== Buildings ==
The main entrance to the college is on the High Street and its grounds are bounded by Merton Street and Magpie Lane. The college is divided by Logic Lane, which is owned by the college and runs through the centre. The western side of the college is occupied by the library, the hall, the chapel and the two quadrangles which house both student accommodation and college offices. The eastern side of the college is mainly devoted to student accommodation in rooms above the High Street shops, on Merton Street or in the separate Goodhart Building. This building is named after former master of the college, Arthur Lehman Goodhart.

A specially constructed building in the college, the Shelley Memorial, houses a statue by Edward Onslow Ford of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley – a former member of the college, who was sent down for writing &quot;The Necessity of Atheism&quot; (1811), along with his friend T. J. Hogg. Shelley is depicted lying dead on the Italian seashore.

The college annexe on Staverton Road in North Oxford houses undergraduate students during their second year and some graduate students.

The college also owns the University College Boathouse (completed in 2007 and designed by Belsize architects) and a sports ground, which is located nearby on Abingdon Road.

=== Univ Alternative Prospectus ===
The Alternative Prospectus is written and produced by current students for prospective applicants. The publication was awarded a HELOA Innovation and Best Practice Award in 2011. The Univ Alternative Prospectus offers student written advice and guidance to potential Oxford applicants. The award recognises the engagement of the college community, unique newspaper format, forward-thinking use of social media and the collaborative working between staff and students.

=== Grace ===
University has the longest grace of any Oxford (and perhaps Cambridge) college. It is read before every Formal Hall, which is held on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays. The reading is performed by a Scholar of the college and whoever is sitting at the head of High Table (typically the Master, or the most senior Fellow at the table if the Master is not dining). 

==== Original version ====
SCHOLAR – &quot;Benedictus sit Deus in donis suis.&quot;&lt;br&gt;RESPONSE – &quot;Et sanctus in omnibus operibus suis.&quot;&lt;br&gt;SCHOLAR – &quot;Adiutorium nostrum in Nomine Domini.&quot;&lt;br&gt;RESPONSE – &quot;Qui fecit coelum et terram.&quot;&lt;br&gt;SCHOLAR – &quot;Sit Nomen Domini benedictum.&quot;&lt;br&gt;RESPONSE – &quot;Ab hoc tempore usque in saecula.&quot;&lt;br&gt;SCHOLAR – &quot;Domine Deus, Resurrectio et Vita credentium, Qui semper es laudandus tam in viventibus quam in defunctis, gratias Tibi agimus pro omnibus Fundatoribus caeterisque Benefactoribus nostris, quorum beneficiis hic ad pietatem et ad studia literarum alimur: Te rogantes ut nos, hisce Tuis donis ad Tuam gloriam recte utentes, una cum iis ad vitam immortalem perducamur.

==== English translation ====
SCHOLAR — &quot;Let God be blessed in his gifts.&quot;&lt;br&gt;RESPONSE — &quot;And holy in all his works.&quot;&lt;br&gt;SCHOLAR — &quot;Our help is in the Name of the Lord.&quot;&lt;br&gt;RESPONSE — &quot;Who has made heaven and earth.&quot;&lt;br&gt;SCHOLAR — &quot; May the Name of the Lord be blessed.&quot;&lt;br&gt;RESPONSE — &quot;From this time for evermore.&quot;&lt;br&gt;SCHOLAR — &quot;Lord God, the resurrection and the life of them that believe, who are always to be praised both among the living and among the dead, we give You thanks for all our founders and other benefactors, by whose gifts we are nourished here for piety and the study of letters; asking You that we, using these Your gifts rightly to Your glory, may be led together with them into eternal life. Through Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot;&lt;br&gt;RESPONSE — &quot;Amen.&quot;&lt;br&gt;SCHOLAR — &quot;May God grant to the living grace, and to the dead rest; to the Church, the King, and our realm, peace and concord; and to us sinners everlasting life.&quot;&lt;br&gt;RESPONSE — &quot;Amen.&quot;

== People associated with the college ==
=== Government and politics ===
Many influential politicians are associated with the college, including the social reformer and author of the Beveridge Report William Beveridge (who was a master of University College) and two UK Prime Ministers: Clement Attlee and Harold Wilson (a Univ fellow). US President Bill Clinton (though he did not graduate) and Prime Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke were also students. Other heads of state and government to have attended Univ include Edgar Whitehead (Rhodesia), Kofi Abrefa Busia (Ghana), and Festus Mogae (Botswana). Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Robert Cecil studied law at the college, similarly U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch received a DPhil in law as a Marshall Scholar, while former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Bernard W. Rogers read Philosophy, Politics and Economics as a Rhodes Scholar, and former Court of Justice of the European Communities Judge Sir David Edward read Classics.

=== Literature and arts ===
In the arts, people associated with the college include poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (expelled for writing &quot;The Necessity of Atheism&quot;), for whom there is a memorial in college; Poet Laureate Andrew Motion; author of the &quot;Narnia&quot; books C. S. Lewis; and a Nobel Prize for Literature winner, Sir V. S. Naipaul. One of the translators of the King James Bible, George Abbot, was a master of the college. The actors Michael York and Warren Mitchell attended Univ, as well as broadcaster Paul Gambaccini.

=== Science and innovation ===
It was due to the college&#x27;s lack of a mathematics fellow (this is no longer the case) that Stephen Hawking read a natural sciences degree and ended up specialising in physics. Other former students include John Radcliffe (physician), William Jones (philologist), and Edmund Cartwright (inventor). Rudolph A. Marcus, a Canadian-born chemist who received the 1992 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, received a Professorial Fellowship at Univ from 1975 to 1976. A perhaps more unusual alumnus is Prince Felix Yusupov, the assassin of Rasputin.

Univ had the highest proportion of old members offering financial support to the college of any Oxbridge college with 28% in 2007.

=== Other connections ===

Although not members of University College, the scientists Robert Boyle (sometimes described as the &quot;first modern chemist&quot;) and his assistant (Robert Hooke, architect, biologist, discoverer of cells) lived in Deep Hall (then owned by Christ Church and now the site of the Shelley Memorial). The former made a contribution to the completion of University College&#x27;s current Hall in the mid-17th century.

Samuel Johnson (author of &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot; and a member of Pembroke College) was a frequent visitor to the Senior Common Room at University College during the 18th century.

== Publications ==
The college produces a number of regular publications, especially for alumni.

=== &quot;University College Record&quot; ===
The &quot;University College Record&quot; is the annual magazine sent to alumni of the college each autumn. The magazine provides college news on clubs and societies such as the University College Players and the Devas Club, as well as academic performance and prizes. News about and obituaries of former students are included at the end of each issue.

Editors have included Peter Bayley and Leslie Mitchell.

=== &quot;The Martlet&quot; ===
&quot;The Martlet&quot; is a magazine for members and friends of the college, available in print and online.

<doc id="128386" wikidata="Q2537765" url="?curid=128386" title="Wadham College, Oxford">
<text>Wadham College () is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. It is located in the centre of Oxford, at the intersection of Broad Street and Parks Road. Wadham College was founded in 1610 by Dorothy Wadham, according to the will of her late husband Nicholas Wadham, a member of an ancient Devon and Somerset family.

The central buildings, a notable example of Jacobean architecture, were designed by the architect William Arnold and erected between 1610 and 1613. They include a large and ornate Hall. Adjacent to the central buildings are the Wadham Gardens. Wadham is one of the largest colleges of the University of Oxford, with about 480 undergraduates and 240 graduate students. The college publishes an annual magazine for alumni, the &quot;Wadham College Gazette&quot;. As of 2022, it had an estimated financial endowment of £113 million, and in the 2021–2022 academic year ranked seventh in the Norrington Table, a measure which ranks Oxford colleges by academic performance.

Amongst Wadham&#x27;s most famous alumni is Sir Christopher Wren. Wren was one of a group of experimental scientists at Oxford in the 1650s, the Oxford Philosophical Club, which included Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke. This group held regular meetings at Wadham College under the guidance of the warden, John Wilkins, and the group formed the nucleus which went on to found the Royal Society.

== History ==
=== 17th century ===
The college was founded by Dorothy Wadham (née Petre) in 1610, according to the wishes set out in the will of her husband Nicholas Wadham. Over four years, she gained royal and ecclesiastical support for the new college, negotiated the purchase of a site, appointed the West Country architect William Arnold, drew up the college statutes, and appointed the first warden, fellows, scholars, and cook. Although she never visited Oxford, she kept tight control of her new college and its finances until her death in 1618.

The wardenship of John Wilkins (1648–1659) is a significant period in the history of the college. Wilkins was a member of a group which had met for some years in London to discuss problems in the natural sciences. Many of the group moved to Oxford and held regular meetings in the Warden&#x27;s lodgings at Wadham. Among them were Robert Boyle, Robert Hooke, John Locke, William Petty, John Wallis, and Thomas Willis. Wadham provided the largest contingent, some twelve of the fifty names mentioned. These included Christopher Brookes (mathematician and instrument-maker), John Mayow (a distinguished chemist and physician), Lawrence Rooke (later astronomy professor at Gresham College, London), Thomas Sprat (later the official historian of the Royal Society), Seth Ward (mathematician and Savilian Professor of Astronomy), and Sir Christopher Wren (mathematician and Savilian Professor of Astronomy).

Sir Christopher Wren was an undergraduate at Wadham before he became a fellow of All Souls and then succeeded Rooke as astronomy professor at Gresham College, London. He eventually returned to occupy rooms at Wadham while he was the Savilian Professor of Astronomy from 1661. Wren had notable achievements in pure and applied mathematics, astronomy, physics and biology to his credit before he turned to architecture, in his thirties. In mathematical ability alone, Wren was ranked by competent authorities second only to Newton among the men of his time.

The Warden&#x27;s lodgings were stuffed with ingenious instruments, and powerful telescopes were mounted on the college tower. The Oxford group kept up close relations with their colleagues in London, and in 1660, at Gresham, the decision was taken to create the body which, in 1662, was to be formally incorporated as the Royal Society. Wilkins was the first president of the provisional body, and became the first secretary of the Royal Society itself. These were the beginnings of organised scientific research in Britain.

=== The Bowra era ===
Maurice Bowra was warden of the college from 1938 until 1970, and was influential in determining the character of the college as open and meritocratic. He was known for his hospitality but also for his waspish wit, and anecdotes about his time as Warden remain in circulation amongst Wadham alumni. A statue of Bowra is in the college gardens, and the college&#x27;s 1992 Bowra Building bears his name.

=== Modern day ===
The college now consists of some 70 Fellows, about 230 graduate students, and about 450 undergraduates. The current Warden is Robert Hannigan. Hannigan succeeded Lord Macdonald of River Glaven QC as Warden upon Macdonald&#x27;s retirement in 2021.

==== Promotion of equality, diversity and rights ====
In 1974, after more than three and a half centuries as a men-only institution, Wadham was among the first group of five all-male colleges at Oxford to admit women as full members, the others being Brasenose, Jesus College, Hertford and St Catherine&#x27;s.

Wadham College has a reputation as a supporter of gay rights partly because it plays host to &quot;Queerfest&quot;, a celebration of the LGBTQ cause. In 2011, Wadham became the first Oxbridge college to fly the Rainbow Flag in support of equality, as part of its annual Queer Week. The rainbow flag also flies over Wadham each year during February, to mark LGBT history month.

A Wadham student tradition is that student social events are always concluded with the playing of the Specials&#x27; &quot;Free Nelson Mandela&quot;. The motion to play the song to conclude every student event until Nelson Mandela was freed from prison was passed by the Wadham Student Union in 1987, when Wadham alumnus Simon Milner (History, 1985), now Policy Director at Facebook, was SU President. Following Mandela&#x27;s liberation, the Student Union voted to continue the tradition as a mark of affection. President Mandela visited Wadham College and dined there on 11 July 1997. In 2017, this tradition was challenged by a South African student, who is a member of the ANC and active in equality campaigning in South Africa, as no longer appropriate given the complex legacy of Mandela in post-Apartheid South Africa. He also highlighted that there is much more to South Africa than just the history of Apartheid, and that constant reference to it rather than South Africa&#x27;s current issues is outdated and no longer the progressive act it was intended to be. A vote to remove the constitutional requirement to play the song was narrowly defeated in a Wadham SU meeting.

In 2013 the warden, Lord Macdonald of River Glaven QC, created the Wadham Human Rights Forum, a new public forum for the discussion of human rights issues that welcomes top level speakers to Wadham College. Lord Macdonald was also frequently in the media speaking on legal issues and, particularly, on issues relating to rights and security.

== Buildings ==
=== Front quad ===

Wadham is sometimes put forward as the last major English public building to be created according to the mediaeval tradition of the Master Mason. Wadham&#x27;s front quadrangle (quad), which served as almost the entire college until the mid-20th century, is also an early example of the &quot;Jacobean Gothic&quot; style that was adopted for many of the university&#x27;s buildings.

The main building was erected in a single building operation in 1610–1613. The architect, William Arnold, was also responsible for Montacute House and Dunster Castle in Somerset, and was involved in the building of Cranborne Manor, Dorset for Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, James I&#x27;s Lord Treasurer. The style of the building is a fairly traditional Oxford Gothic, modified by classical decorative detail, most notably the &#x27;frontispiece&#x27; framing statues of James I and the Founders immediately facing visitors as they enter the college. Classical, too, is the over-powering emphasis on symmetry. The central quadrangle was originally gravelled throughout; the present lawn was laid down in 1809. The college was refaced in the 1960s, and much of the front quad has undergone further restoration work.

In 2019 a new 135 bed student accommodation was completed for the campus.

=== Hall ===

In 1898, the hall was the third largest amongst Oxford colleges after Christ Church and New College. It is notable for its great hammer-beam roof and for the Jacobean woodwork of the entrance screen. The portraits include those of the founders and of distinguished members of the college. The large portrait in the gallery is of John Lovelace, who held Oxford for William of Orange during the Revolution of 1688; the inscription records his role in freeing England &#x27;from popery and slavery&#x27;.
=== Chapel ===

Although a ceremonial door opens directly into Front Quad, the chapel is usually reached through the door in staircase 3. The screen, similar to that in the hall, was carved by John Bolton. Originally Jacobean woodwork ran right round the chapel. The present stone reredos was inserted in the east end in 1834. The elegant young man reclining on his monument is Sir John Portman, baronet, who died in 1624 as a nineteen-year-old undergraduate. Another monument is in the form of a pile of books; it commemorates Thomas Harris, one of the fellows of the college appointed at the foundation. The Chapel organ dates from 1862 and 1886. It is one of the few instruments by Henry Willis, the doyen of Victorian English organ builders, to survive without substantial modification of its tonal design.

==== Windows ====
The East Window, which depicts several scenes from the Old and New Testaments, was created by Bernard van Linge in 1622. The windows on the north and south sides of the chapel depict various Old Testament prophets, such as Jonah, and apostles, such as St Andrew. They originate from different periods. One window is dated 1616, and attributed to Robert Rutland, a local craftsman. The windows of the antechapel, which also show saintly figures, are Victorian. They were designed by John Bridges, and created by David Evans in 1838.

=== Back Quad ===
Limited additions were made during the 18th and 19th centuries, including a converted warehouse originally used to store Bibles. A series of expansions since 1952 have made use of a range of 17th- and 18th-century houses and several modern buildings to create a Back Quad between the Front Quad and Holywell Street.

=== Bar Quad ===
The small quadrangle formed by the Junior Common Room, the William Doo Undergraduate Centre, the Dr. Lee Shau Kee Building, the Holywell Music Room and (latterly) the Bowra Building was sometimes known to students as the &quot;Ho Chi Minh&quot; quad. It is thought to have been thus named (in honour of Vietnamese revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh) during the period of student radicalism in the 1960s.

=== Holywell Music Room ===

The college grounds contain the Holywell Music Room. This is said to be the oldest purpose-built music room in Europe, and hence England&#x27;s first concert hall. It was designed by Thomas Camplin, at that time Vice-Principal of St Edmund Hall, and opened in July 1748. The interior has been restored to a near-replica of the original and contains the only surviving Donaldson organ, built in 1790 by John Donaldson of Newcastle and installed in 1985 after being restored.

=== Ferdowsi Library ===
The Ferdowsi Library (formerly the Ashraf Pahlavi Library) specialises in Persian literature, art, history, and culture. It possesses about 3,500 volumes, almost 800 manuscripts, about 200 lithographs in Arabic and Persian, and about 700 rare and early Armenian books, most of which were donated by Dr. Caro Minasian.

At the end of the 1960s, the Warden, Maurice Bowra, President of the British Academy and one of the first co-founders of the British Institute of Persian Studies (BIPS), welcomed a donation to construct the building of the New Library in Wadham, where the emphasis would be given to Persian Studies and the post in Persian. Since then a special connection between Wadham and Iran has been established.

The Wadham library building was initially funded by donations from the then (1976) Iranian ruling family, the Pahlavi dynasty. The funds were secured by Fellow and tutor in economics, Eprime Eshag. The building, with associated accommodation blocks, was designed by Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia. Today the library is open 24/7 and has wireless connectivity throughout.

=== Bowra Building ===
The Bowra Building next to the Ferdowsi Library and Bar Quad was designed by Sir Richard MacCormac and opened in 1992. It includes a cafeteria, gym, seminar rooms, squash court and the Moser Theatre as well as student rooms. It also included a bar, which has since been moved to the Dr Lee Shau Kee Building and William Doo Undergraduate Centre.

=== McCall MacBain Graduate Centre ===
The McCall MacBain Graduate Centre was designed by Lee/Fitzgerald Architects and opened in 2012. It won a 2014 Riba Regional Award and Conservation Award. It provides a dedicated social and study space for Wadham&#x27;s graduate students on the main site of Wadham college.

=== Dr Lee Shau Kee Building and William Doo Undergraduate Centre ===
The Dr Lee Shau Kee Building and William Doo Undergraduate Centre were designed by Amanda Levete Architects. They replaced the Goddard building of 1951 and now provide facilities for the college&#x27;s access activities and student union. Construction began in 2018 and was completed in late 2020.

=== Merifield ===
The Merifield annexe, named after Merryfield, Ilton once home to the Wadhams, is in Summertown, about 1.2 miles from the centre of Oxford.
Most of the graduate student accommodation is at Merifield.

=== Dorothy Wadham Building ===
The Dorothy Wadham Building, on Iffley Road, was designed by Allies and Morrison and opened in 2019. It houses undergraduates, predominantly in their second year of studies.

== Gardens ==
Wadham Gardens are relatively large when compared with those of other Oxford colleges, even without the land sold to build Rhodes House in the 1920s. Originally a series of orchards and market-gardens carved out from the property of the previously existing Augustinian priory, their appearance and configuration have been significantly modified over the course of the last four hundred years to reflect their constantly changing functional and aesthetic purpose.

The land was shaped, in particular, by two major periods of planning. Gardens were first created under Warden Wilkins (1648–1659) as a series of formal rectangles laid out around a (then fashionable) mound which was, in turn, surmounted by a figure of Atlas. These gardens were notable not least for their collection of mechanical contrivances (including a talking statue and a rainbow-maker), a number of obelisks and a Doric temple. Under Warden Wills (1783–1806), the terrain was then radically remodelled and landscaped (by Shipley) and became notable for a distinguished collection of trees.Restored and reshaped following the Second World War, the present Gardens are divided into the Warden&#x27;s Garden, the Fellows&#x27; Private Garden and the Fellows&#x27; Garden, together with the Cloister Garden (originally the cemetery) and the White Scented Garden.
They are still notable for their collection of trees (specimens include a holm oak, silver pendant lime, tulip tree, golden yew, purple beech, cedar of Lebanon, ginkgo, giant redwood, tree of heaven, incense cedar, Corsican pine, magnolia and a rare Chinese gutta-percha) and they still contain a number of vestigial curiosities from the past (notably an 18th-century &#x27;cowshed&#x27; set into the remnants of the Royalist earthworks of 1642, one of the second generation of &#x27;Emperors Heads&#x27; that adorned the Sheldonian Theatre from 1868 to around 1970, and a sculpture of Warden Bowra).

== Student life ==

Undergraduate students at Wadham are offered accommodation for all years of their course.
Accommodation is provided within college for the first and final years of their course, and during the second (or fourth) year within the newly constructed Dorothy Wadham Building, on Iffley Road, or within the Merifield annexe in Summertown.

Since 1976, Wadham has been distinctive in having a Student Union, which in principle represents both undergraduate and graduate members. In practice the SU is more concerned with undergraduate interests and activities, whilst the separate MCR committee represents graduate students.

All students can use the on-site facilities such as the Moser Theatre, squash court, gym, kitchen, laundry room, music practice rooms and various meeting rooms. The JCR Lounge is the main common room space used by undergraduate students, along with the bar. Since 2012 the MCR has had its own social area in the McCall MacBain Graduate Centre, with its kitchen, small bar, and media room. The college sports ground is located in Summertown, adjoining the Merifield residential complex.

The Wadham JCR common room consists of a pool table and a table tennis table. Famously, this has been the home of the Wadham bar sports team for over 15 years which has now grown to over 30 members. Notable alumni include influential figures from the finance, tech and legal sectors, in particular BlackRock, Google and Hogan Lovells. An annual dinner is an important part of student life and has brought the years together over a shared love of pool and darts. In 2022 the Wadham pool team set a new record with a 78% frame win rate in Cuppers.

Wadham has a student exchange programme with the Sarah Lawrence College in New York. About 30 students come each year and live at Merifield, and about six Wadham students go to SLC in the spring each year for 3 weeks.

There are elected welfare officers on both the SU and MCR committees. There is a general welfare room, as well as a women&#x27;s room. The college also has a nurse who runs an open surgery.

Wadham has a relatively high number of state school students, compared to other Oxford colleges. Wadham hosts Queerfest (formally Queer Bop), and Wadstock (a twelve-hour live music festival named after Woodstock). It also hosts bops five times a term in Michaelmas term and Hilary term. A Wadham student tradition is that events are always concluded with the playing of &quot;Free Nelson Mandela&quot;.

There are three football teams, two chess teams, a cricket team, a boat club, a hockey team with Trinity, trampolining Cuppers side (mixed); Gaelic Football Cuppers side, men&#x27;s darts, men&#x27;s rugby, women&#x27;s rugby Fives, mixed pool as well as Ultimate Frisbee. There is also Wadham Women&#x27;s Weightlifting, an inclusive weightlifting club for marginalised genders.

Wadham College Boat Club is the rowing club for students at Wadham, and it also allows Harris Manchester College students to join. The college boat house is located on Boathouse Island.

== Anecdotes and curiosities ==
* Under the original statutes, women were forbidden from entering the college, with the exception of a laundress who was to be of &#x27;such age, condition, and reputation as to be above suspicion.&#x27;
* Wadham had amongst its fellowship the notable poet John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester (1647–1680) who earned a reputation as the most famous womanizer of his era. The 2004 movie &quot;The Libertine&quot;, which starred Johnny Depp as Rochester, coincidentally also starred Rosamund Pike, a Wadham alumna.
* In 1739 the warden of Wadham, Robert Thistlethwayte, fled England after a homosexual scandal. The event prompted the limerick:
:The college was renowned for its relaxed attitude to homosexuality, and revelled in its nickname of &#x27;Sodom&#x27;.
* In 1968, as student protests became commonplace at centres of learning in Europe and the Americas, the Warden and Fellows are reported to have sent this reply to a set of &quot;non-negotiable demands&quot;:Dear Gentlemen: We note your threat to take what you call &#x27;direct action&#x27; unless your demands are immediately met. We feel it is only sporting to remind you that our governing body includes three experts in chemical warfare, two ex-commandos skilled with dynamite and torturing prisoners, four qualified marksmen in both small arms and rifles, two ex-artillerymen, one holder of the Victoria Cross, four karate experts and a chaplain. The governing body has authorized me to tell you that we look forward with confidence to what you call a &#x27;confrontation,&#x27; and I may say, with anticipation.The letter seemed to have dimmed the students&#x27; fire, was reprinted in Harper&#x27;s Bazaar, and cited in newspaper columns and speeches for at least two years following its publication.
* In the days when Oxford colleges locked their gates overnight, Wadham was regarded as a particularly difficult college to climb into after the gates closed. One route into the college was said to be via the Warden&#x27;s Lodgings in the corner of the front quad. College legend has it that an undergraduate was quietly making his way through the lodgings when Warden Bowra entered the room. The undergraduate rapidly secreted himself behind a sofa, whilst Bowra took a book from the bookcase and settled down to read for several hours. When Bowra eventually rose to leave, he quipped &quot;turn the lights off before you go, there&#x27;s a good fellow&quot;.
* The pattern in the pavement outside the student bar at Wadham College is a Penrose tiling, named after the Wadham mathematician and Nobel Laureate Roger Penrose who invented it in the 1970s. Penrose tilings have many interesting mathematical properties, and they also explain the structure of some unusual metallic crystals, called quasicrystals, that were discovered in the 1980s and won Dan Shechtman the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2011.
* The 2004 animated film &quot;Pinocchio 3000&quot;, a science fiction retelling of the classic tale by Carlo Collodi, is replete with oblique visual cues and other references to various Oxford colleges, but predominantly Wadham, the alma mater of three of the senior production team.
* In January 2013, skeletons were discovered during building works on college grounds. Contrary to previous rumours of bullet wounds being found on one of the bodies, these remains were found to be medieval in origin.

== People associated with Wadham ==

=== Notable people ===
In common with many Oxford colleges, Wadham has produced a wide range of graduates in the fields of economics, history, law, physiology, medicine, management, humanities, mathematics, science, technology, media, philosophy, poetry, politics and religion who have contributed significantly to public life.

Notable members of the college in its early years include Robert Blake, Cromwell&#x27;s admiral and founder of British sea-power in the Mediterranean, John Cook the first solicitor general of the English Commonwealth and prosecutor of King Charles I, the libertine poet and courtier John Wilmot 2nd Earl of Rochester, and Sir Christopher Wren. Wren attended the meetings of scientifically inclined scholars which were held by Warden John Wilkins (Cromwell&#x27;s brother-in-law) in the college in the 1650s. Those attending formed the nucleus of the Royal Society at its foundation in 1662.

John Wilkins invited Robert Boyle to Oxford in 1653, writing that &quot;[I] shall be most ready to provide the best accommodations for you, that this place will afford&quot;. Boyle moved to Oxford in 1655, but preferred not to accept Wilkins&#x27;s offer of accommodation, choosing instead to arrange his own rooms where he could carry out his scientific experiments. Boyle became a member of the Oxford Philosophical Club that met weekly in Wilkins&#x27;s chambers at Wadham, as did Robert Hooke who became Boyle&#x27;s assistant after having been a chorister at Christ Church.

Arthur Onslow (1708), a great Speaker of the House of Commons, and Richard Bethell, who became Lord Chancellor as Lord Westbury in 1861, were members of the college.

Two 20th-century Lord Chancellors, F. E. Smith (Lord Birkenhead) and John Simon, were undergraduates together in the 1890s, along with the sportsman C. B. Fry; Sir Thomas Beecham was an undergraduate in 1897, though soon abandoning Oxford for his musical career.

Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell, who was Churchill&#x27;s scientific adviser during the Second World War, was a fellow of the college. Cecil Day-Lewis, later Poet-Laureate, came up in 1923, and Michael Foot, later leader of the Labour Party, in 1931. Sir Maurice Bowra, scholar and wit, was Warden between 1938 and 1970. Robert Moses, the city planner, joined the college in 1911.

Among recent members have been Dr Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Dyson, former justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and Master of the Rolls, author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg, writer and journalist Jonathan Freedland, novelists Hari Kunzru and Monica Ali, and Wasim Sajjad, former Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan and twice President of Pakistan. The mathematical physicist and philosopher Sir Roger Penrose was Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics 1973–1999, and is now an emeritus fellow.

Andrew Hodges, the theoretical physicist and author of &quot;The Imitation Game&quot;, the biography of Alan Turing, is a Tutorial Fellow in mathematics at Wadham. Having taught at Wadham since 1986, Hodges was elected a Fellow in 2007, and was appointed Dean from start of the 2011/12 academic year.

Film directors Lindsay Anderson and Tony Richardson were Wadham alumni. 

Actors Rosamund Pike and Felicity Jones studied English at the College. Each has a portrait displayed in the college hall, and Rosamund Pike is an Honorary Fellow.

<text>Sperry Corporation was a major American equipment and electronics company whose existence spanned more than seven decades of the 20th century. Sperry ceased to exist in 1986 following a prolonged hostile takeover bid engineered by Burroughs Corporation, which merged the combined operation under the new name Unisys. Some of Sperry&#x27;s former divisions became part of Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Technologies, and Northrop Grumman.

The company is best known as the developer of the artificial horizon and a wide variety of other gyroscope-based aviation instruments like autopilots, bombsights, analog ballistics computers and gyro gunsights. In the post-WWII era the company branched out into electronics, both aviation-related, and later, computers.

The company was founded by Elmer Ambrose Sperry.

==History==
===Early history===

The company was incorporated on April 14 1910 by Elmer Ambrose Sperry as the Sperry Gyroscope Company, to manufacture navigation equipment—chiefly his own inventions: the marine gyrostabilizer and the gyrocompass—at 40 Flatbush Avenue Extension in Downtown Brooklyn. During World War I the company diversified into aircraft components including bomb sights and fire control systems. In their early decades, Sperry Gyroscope and related companies were concentrated on Long Island, New York, especially in Nassau County. Over the years, it diversified to other locations.

In 1918, Lawrence Sperry split from his father to compete over aero-instruments with the &quot;Lawrence Sperry Aircraft Company&quot;, including the new automatic pilot. After the death of Lawrence on December 13, 1923, the two firms were brought together in 1924. Then in January 1929 it was acquired by North American Aviation, who reincorporated it in New York as the &quot;Sperry Gyroscope Company, Inc&quot;. The company once again became independent in 1933 when it was spun-off as a subsidiary of the newly formed Sperry Corporation. The new corporation was a holding company for a number of smaller entities such as the original Sperry Gyroscope, &quot;Ford Instrument Company&quot;, &quot;Intercontinental Aviation, Inc.&quot;, and others. The company made advanced aircraft navigation equipment for the market, including the Sperry Gyroscope and the Sperry Radio Direction Finder. It also moved into the hydraulics industry when it acquired Vickers, Inc. in 1937. Sperry supported the work of a group of Stanford University inventors, led by Russell and Sigurd Varian, who had invented the klystron, and incorporated this technology and related inventions into their products.

The company prospered during World War II as military demand skyrocketed, ranking 19th among US corporations in the value of wartime production contracts. It specialized in high technology devices such as analog computer–controlled bomb sights, airborne radar systems, and automated take-off and landing systems. Sperry also was the creator of the Ball Turret Gun mounted under the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and the Consolidated B-24 Liberator.

In 1944, Sperry sold the Brooklyn factory at 40 Flatbush Avenue Extension to the Howard clothing manufacturing company, which already had a smaller nearby factory.

Postwar, Sperry expanded its interests in electronics and computing, producing the company&#x27;s first digital computer, SPEEDAC, in 1953.

During the 1950s, a large part of Sperry Gyroscope moved to Phoenix, Arizona and soon became the Sperry Flight Systems Company. This was to preserve parts of this defense company in the event of a nuclear war. The Gyroscope division remained headquartered in New York—in its massive Lake Success, Long Island, plant (which also served as the temporary United Nations headquarters from 1946 to 1952)—into the 1980s.

===Sperry Rand===

In 1955, Sperry acquired Remington Rand and renamed itself Sperry Rand. Acquiring then- Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation and Engineering Research Associates along with Remington Rand, the company developed the successful UNIVAC computer series and signed a valuable cross-licensing deal with IBM. The company remained a major military contractor. From 1967 to 1973, the corporation was involved in an acrimonious antitrust lawsuit with Honeywell, Inc. (see &quot;Honeywell v. Sperry Rand&quot;).

In 1961, Sperry Rand was ranked 34th on the Fortune 500 list of largest companies in the United States.

In 1977, Sperry Rand purchased Varian Data Machines so as to enter the minicomputer market. Varian would be renamed as the Sperry UNIVAC Minicomputer Operation, operating as part of the Sperry UNIVAC division.

In 1978, Sperry Rand decided to concentrate on its computing interests, and sold a number of divisions including Remington Rand Systems, Remington Rand Machines, Ford Instrument Company and Sperry Vickers. The company dropped &quot;Rand&quot; from its title and reverted to Sperry Corporation.

At about the same time as the Remington Rand acquisition, Sperry Gyroscope decided to open a facility that would almost exclusively produce its marine instruments. After considerable searching and evaluation, a plant was built in Charlottesville, Virginia, and in 1956, Sperry Piedmont Division began producing marine navigation products. It was later renamed Sperry Marine.
In the 1970s, Sperry Corporation was a traditional conglomerate headquartered in the Sperry Rand Building at 1290 Avenue of Americas in Manhattan, selling typewriters (Sperry Remington); office equipment, electronic digital computers for business and the military (Sperry Univac); construction and farm equipment (Sperry New Holland); avionics, such as gyroscopes, radars, air route traffic control equipment (Sperry Vickers/Sperry Flight Systems); and consumer products such as electric razors (Sperry Remington). In addition, Sperry Systems Management (headquartered in the original Sperry Gyroscope building in Lake Success) performed work on a number of US government defense contracts. Sperry also managed the operation from 1961 to 1975 of the large Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant near Minden. In January 1972, Sperry took over the RCA Spectra 70 line of electronic digital computers (architectural cousins to the IBM System/360). In 1983, Sperry sold Vickers to Libbey Owens Ford (later to be renamed TRINOVA Corporation and subsequently Aeroquip-Vickers). At the same time, it acquired the Aircraft Radio Corporation from Cessna.

===Burroughs takeover===
On September 16, 1986, after the success of a second hostile takeover bid engineered by Burroughs Corporation CEO and former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Michael Blumenthal, Sperry Corporation merged with Burroughs Corporation. The newly merged company was renamed Unisys Corporation— a portmanteau of &quot;united&quot;, &quot;information&quot;, and &quot;systems,&quot; while also referencing Sperry&#x27;s well-known previous UNIVAC computer branding. The takeover came about even after Sperry used a &quot;poison pill&quot; in the form of a major share price hike to dissuade the hostile bid, the result of which caused Burroughs to borrow much more funding than was anticipated to complete the bid.

Certain internal divisions of Sperry were sold off after the merger, such as Sperry New Holland (1986, to Ford Motor Company, who in 1991 sold the Ford-New Holland line to Fiat) and Sperry Marine (to Tenneco, in 1987, and is currently part of Northrop Grumman). Also sold—to Honeywell—was Sperry Aerospace Group, while Sperry Defense Products Group was sold to Loral; those two units whose functions were originally at the heart of the venerable Sperry Gyroscope division. This group is now part of Lockheed Martin.

===British Sperry===
Sperry in Britain started with a factory in Pimlico, London, in 1913, manufacturing gyroscopic compasses for the
Royal Navy. It became the Sperry Gyroscope Co Ltd in 1915. In 1923, Lawrence Sperry was killed in an air crash near Rye, Sussex. The company subsequently expanded to the Golden Mile, Brentford in 1931, Stonehouse, Gloucestershire in 1938, and Bracknell in 1957. By 1963, these sites employed some 3,500 people. The Brentford site closed in 1967, with the expansion of Bracknell. Stonehouse closed around 1969. By 1969, the Sperry Gyroscope division of Sperry Rand Corporation employed around 2,500.

The site of the Bracknell factory and development center (sold to British Aerospace in 1982) is commemorated by a 4.5-meter aluminum sculpture by Philip Bentham, &quot;Sperry&#x27;s New Symbolic Gyroscope&quot; (1967).

In 1989, the Bracknell site was downsized and work was moved to the Sperry manufacturing site in Plymouth by then under the British Aerospace brand. State of the art, high technology MEMS gyroscopes (together with other avionics equipment) are still made on the site today, although the company is now owned by United Technologies Corporation and is part of UTC Aerospace Systems.

===Sperry since 1997===
The name Sperry lives on in the company Sperry Marine, headquartered in New Malden, England. This company, formed in 1997, from three well-known brand names in the marine industry—Sperry Marine, Decca, and C. Plath—is now part of Northrop Grumman Corporation. It is a worldwide supplier of navigation, communication, information and automation systems for commercial marine and naval markets.

<doc id="128389" wikidata="Q2023489" url="?curid=128389" title="Moravian Falls, North Carolina">
<text>Moravian Falls (formerly, Petersburg and Forks of the Road) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Wilkes County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 1,712 as of the 2020 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, is land and 0.20% is water. Moravian Falls is located in the foothills of the Brushy Mountains, which rise to the south of the community. Pores Knob, the highest point in the Brushy Mountains, is located in Moravian Falls.

==Climate==
Moravian Falls has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and the hardiness zone is 7B. In Moravian Falls, the summers are warm and humid, the winters are cool, and it is wet and partly cloudy year round.

Average annual rainfall (49.7 inches) for the town falls just short of the typical average of the Southern Appalachian region (60.0+ inches). Moravian Falls averages roughly 6 inches of snow per year. The highest recorded temperature in Moravian Falls was while the lowest recorded temperature was .

Moravian Falls receives ample amounts of precipitation, with frequent thunderstorms in the spring and summer months; and rain, snow, sleet, and freezing rain all occur at times during the winter. Severe weather is not common in Moravian Falls but does occur. Tornadoes are rare, but severe thunderstorms can bring strong winds which can down trees and power lines, as well as cause hail. On October 23, 2017, a rare EF 1 tornado touched down in the community of Moravian Falls, before moving into the towns of Wilkesboro and North Wilkesboro, and then through the Mulberry, Fairplains, and Hays communities, causing significant damage.

==Background==
Moravian Falls takes its name from a waterfall in the foothills of the Brushy Mountains. The area was originally settled by the Owen family in about 1750. In 1754, the Moravian Church purchased approximately 9000 acres of land which now lies under the nearby W. Kerr Scott Dam and Reservoir. However, there is no record that the Moravians ever attempted to establish a settlement in the area during the 18th century. Today the waterfall is a local tourist attraction.

Beginning in the late 1800s and for several decades thereafter, Moravian Falls was an oddly significant publishing hub, with several local newspapers published there being distributed nationally and claiming circulations in the hundreds of thousands. The &quot;Yellow Jacket&quot;, the &quot;Fool-Killer&quot;, and the &quot;Lash&quot; were the leading papers, but more than a dozen were published in the tiny town. At its peak, the &quot;Yellow Jacket&quot; claimed a circulation of 1 million copies, though rivals estimated a number more like 250,000 — which was still more than twice the Sunday circulation of any other newspaper in the South.

Wilkes Central High School, and Central Wilkes Middle School, are located in Moravian Falls. The two schools are the largest and most ethnically diverse high school and middle school respectively in the Wilkes County public school system.

The Benjamin Hubbard House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

<text>Worcester College ( ) is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England. The college was founded in 1714 by the benefaction of Sir Thomas Cookes, 2nd Baronet (1648–1701) of Norgrove, Worcestershire, whose coat of arms was adopted by the college. Its predecessor, Gloucester College, had been an institution of learning on the same site since the late 13th century until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539. Founded as a men&#x27;s college, Worcester has been coeducational since 1979. The provost is David Isaac, CBE who took office on 1 July 2021.

As of 2022, Worcester College had a financial endowment of £59.6 million.

Notable alumni of the college include the media mogul Rupert Murdoch, television producer and screenwriter Russell T Davies, US Supreme Court justice Elena Kagan, Fields Medallist Simon Donaldson, novelist Richard Adams (author of ‘Watership Down’), professional basketball player and US Senator Bill Bradley, and the Sultan of Perak, Nazrin Shah.

==Buildings and grounds==

The buildings are diverse, especially in the main quadrangle: looking down into the main quadrangle from the entrance through the main building, to the right is an imposing eighteenth century building in the neo-classical style; and to the left a row of medieval buildings known as &quot;the cottages&quot;, which are among the oldest residential buildings in Oxford. These cottages are the most substantial surviving part of Gloucester College, Worcester&#x27;s predecessor on the same site: this was a college for Benedictine monks, founded in 1283 and dissolved with the Dissolution of the Monasteries in about 1539.
After a lapse of 20 years, the buildings of the old Gloucester College were used in the foundation of an academic hall, &quot;Gloucester Hall&quot;, in around 1560. The penultimate principal, Benjamin Woodroffe, attempted to establish there a &#x27;Greek College&#x27; for Greek Orthodox students to come to Oxford, part of a scheme to make ecumenical links with the Church of England. This was a going concern from 1699 to 1705, although only 15 Greeks are recorded as members.

In 1714, thanks to a fortunate benefaction from a Worcestershire baronet, Sir Thomas Cookes, Gloucester Hall was transformed into Worcester College. Even then, there were only sufficient funds to rebuild the Chapel, Hall and Library and the north side of the Front Quad, known as the Terrace. The designs were by George Clarke, who had consulted Nicholas Hawksmoor.

In 1736, Clarke generously left to the college his great collection of books and manuscripts. These included the papers of his father William Clarke (which are of crucial importance for the history of England during the period of the Commonwealth and Protectorate) and a large proportion of the surviving drawings of Inigo Jones.
Owing to lack of funds, Worcester&#x27;s eighteenth-century building programme proceeded by fits and starts. The west end of the Terrace and the Provost&#x27;s Lodgings were added in 1773–1776 (architect: Henry Keene). The medieval cottages were to have been replaced by a further classical range, but survived because money for this purpose was never available; the Hall and Chapel, by James Wyatt, were not completed until the 1770s.

===The Chapel===
The College Chapel was built in the 18th century. George Clarke, Henry Keene, and James Wyatt were responsible for different stages of its lengthy construction (1720–1791), owing to a shortage of funds. The interior columns and pilasters, the dome, and the delicate foliage plastering are all Wyatt&#x27;s work. His classical interior was insufficiently emphatic for the tastes of militant Victorian churchmen, and between 1864 and 1866 the chapel was redecorated by William Burges. It is highly unusual and decorative; being predominantly pink, the pews are decorated with carved animals, including kangaroos and whales, and the walls are riotously colourful, and include frescoes of dodos and peacocks. Its stained glass windows were to have been designed by John Everett Millais, but Burges rejected his designs and entrusted the work to Henry Holiday. Oscar Wilde said of the Chapel, &quot;As a piece of simple decorative and beautiful art it is perfect, and the windows very artistic.&quot;
===The Chapel Choirs===
Worcester is unique among the Oxford colleges in that it has not one, but two chapel choirs of equal status, which share out the weekly services between them. There is a mixed-voice choir constituted of auditioned choral scholars and volunteers, which sings twice a week: weekly on Thursday and on alternating Sunday and Monday evenings. The Boys&#x27; Choir consists of trebles from Christ Church Cathedral School and alto, tenor and bass choral scholars. This choir also sings twice weekly; on Sunday and Tuesday evenings. These choirs are run on a day-to-day basis by Worcester&#x27;s two Organ Scholars alongside the director of music.

===The Hall===
William Burges was commissioned to redecorate the Hall, but was forced to curtail his elaborate designs by a lack of funds. A reduced scheme was completed in 1877 but was substantially altered in the early-twentieth century, and in 1966 Wyatt&#x27;s designs were restored using his original drawings (preserved in the College Library), under the direction of architect Emil Godfrey. The Hall was refurbished and redecorated in 2018.

===Modern buildings===
In more recent years, several new residential blocks for undergraduates and graduates have been added, thanks in part to a series of generous benefactions. The latest of these include the Earl Building, Sainsbury Building (which won the Civic Trust Award in 1984), Linbury Building, Canal Building, Ruskin Lane Building (for undergraduates), the Franks Building (for graduates), and the Sultan Nazrin Shah Centre, which won numerous architectural awards and was shortlisted for the 2018 Stirling Prize.

The Canal Building sits next to the north entrance to the college and, as the name suggests, beside the Oxford Canal. It houses 50 students in large en-suite single rooms. The accommodation is usually reserved for third and fourth-year undergraduates.

===The Gardens===
Although Worcester is near the centre of Oxford today, it was on the edge of the city in the eighteenth century. This has proved a benefit in the long run, since it has allowed the college to retain very extensive gardens and contiguous playing fields (a total of , including a lake).

The gardens have won numerous awards, including the Oxford in Bloom college award every time they have been entered for the competition. Extensive work on the gardens was carried out between 1817 and 1820, and they may have been laid out in the Picturesque style by Richard Greswell in 1827. They are now managed by head gardener Simon Bagnall and a team of seven gardeners.

A production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; was directed by Patrick Garland in the gardens with Oz Clarke as Sir Toby Belch and Francis Matthews. Other garden plays have included &quot;The Tempest&quot; on the lake, directed by Nevill Coghill in 1949, and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; in the Provost&#x27;s garden, directed by provost Jonathan Bate and undergraduate Georgia Figgis in 2016.

From February 2009 until December 2018 the college&#x27;s gardeners kept a blog to provide an insight into the work involved in looking after the .

==Traditions==
Every three years in June, the college hosts a commemoration ball.

The College holds a Formal Hall on several days of the week; dress is formal with gowns compulsory for matriculated students. Before each meal, the college grace is recited by a scholar, or student studying a field related to Literae Humaniores. The text is the same as that recited at Christ Church but, in comparison, always given in the long form, in Latin:

Translated into English:

Every Hilary (spring) term on the Saturday of 4th Week, second-year members of the College celebrate &#x27;Midway&#x27; to mark the point at which they are exactly halfway through their degree (given that students on 3-year courses attend for nine terms, each lasting eight weeks). The occasion is marked with the taking of professional photographs: one in formal dress (but not gowns), and the other in costumes made by the students, usually reflecting themes decided by individual groups of friends. Later in the day, a meal is served in Formal Hall to distinguish the event.

==Sports==
Worcester College is known for its sporting prowess, especially in football, cricket, and hockey, and is one of the few colleges to have its sporting grounds onsite (football, rugby, tennis, basketball, netball, croquet, and cricket). In the 2011/2012 season, Worcester won Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Football Cuppers. During recent years the hockey side has won numerous league titles, &#x27;Varsity Cuppers&#x27; or &#x27;Supercuppers&#x27; in 2015, and Cuppers in 2016.. 
The Worcester College Boat Club was founded in 1825 and shares the boathouse building with Merton College Boat Club.

<doc id="128391" wikidata="Q2007225" url="?curid=128391" title="Wolfson College, Oxford">
<text>Wolfson College () is a constituent college of the University of Oxford in England. Wolfson is an all-graduate college, it prides itself on being one of the most international colleges at Oxford, with particular strengths in areas like global health, environmental studies, economics, and humanities. With a spacious, green campus located along the River Cherwell, it is known for its relaxed atmosphere, modern architecture and beautiful gardens, creating a peaceful environment for a focused academic community. Its motto is &quot;Humani nil alienum,&quot; which translates as &quot;Nothing human is alien to me.&quot;

The historian and philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin was the college&#x27;s first president, and was instrumental not only in its founding, but establishing a tradition of academic excellence and egalitarianism. Since then, the college caters to a wide range of subjects, from the humanities to the social and natural sciences, being coeducational since its foundation in 1965. The college houses &quot;The Isaiah Berlin Literary Trust&quot; and hosts an annual &quot;Isaiah Berlin Lecture&quot;. From 2017, the president of the college has been Sir Tim Hitchens.

As of 2021, the college had a financial endowment of £60.3 million, and is registered as a charity.

Wolfson&#x27;s sister college at the University of Cambridge is Darwin College.

==History==
Wolfson&#x27;s first president Sir Isaiah Berlin, the influential political philosopher and historian of ideas, was instrumental in the college&#x27;s founding in 1965.

The college began its existence with the name Iffley College, which offered a new community for graduate students at Oxford, particularly in natural and social sciences. Twelve other colleges of the university provided grants to make the establishment of Iffley possible. As of 1965, the college had neither a president nor a building. Berlin set out to change this, eventually securing support from the Wolfson Foundation and Ford Foundation in 1966 to establish a separate site for the college, which included &#x27;Cherwell&#x27;, the former residence of J. S. Haldane and his family, as well as new buildings built around it. In recognition of Isaac Wolfson&#x27;s contribution to the foundation of the college, its name was changed to Wolfson College.

But Berlin&#x27;s work as the president of the college was far from over. Formally taking over the reins of the college in 1967, he envisioned Wolfson to be a centre of academic excellence but, unlike many other colleges at Oxford, also bound it to a strong egalitarian and democratic ethos. In Berlin&#x27;s words, the college would be &#x27;new, untrammelled and unpyramided&#x27;.

If Berlin was the inspiration and beacon for this most modern of academic institutions, its birth and early shape would not have happened without the tireless backroom work of Berlin&#x27;s vice-president, Michael Brock, formerly of Corpus Christi College. They were a formidable team and ensured Berlin&#x27;s ideals were largely achieved. 

Wolfson is perhaps the most egalitarian college at Oxford, with few barriers between students and fellows. There is no high table, only one common room for all the members of the college, and gowns are worn only on special occasions. Graduate students serve on the college&#x27;s governing body and participate in General Meetings. Berlin&#x27;s reputation and presence in the early years also helped shape the intellectual character of the college, attracting many distinguished fellows like Niko Tinbergen, who won a Nobel Prize for his studies in animal behaviour in 1973. Berlin&#x27;s own prominence in the humanities helped attract many graduate students like Henry Hardy, interested in political philosophy and the history of ideas.

==Buildings and grounds==

The main building of the college, designed by Powell and Moya Architects and completed in 1974, is one of the most modern main buildings of all Oxford colleges. It has three quadrangles: the central quadrangle named the Berlin Quad after Isaiah Berlin, the Tree Quad built around established trees, and the River Quad into which the River Cherwell has been diverted to form a punt harbour. The main building and footbridge across the river were grade II listed in June 2011.

The college has student accommodation in the main college building, in three child-friendly courtyards surrounded by family housing, and also has similar accommodation in a scattering of purpose-built blocks, including the Robin Gandy Buildings, and in existing houses on Linton Road, Chadlington Road and Garford Road. The college also owns an adjacent house and orchard that was occupied by the Bishop of Oxford until 2014. Wolfson College aims to cut its emissions and plans to be carbon neutral by 2030.

===Library===
The college library, which occupies both floors of one wing of the college&#x27;s main building, is open to members of the college. The main library is on the first floor, approachable from the side of the dining hall and the lodge, and two other collections, called the Floersheimer Room and the Hornik Memorial Room are on the ground floor. A mezzanine floor in the main library has books as well as carrels for individual use by graduate students of the college. The library has an extensive collection of books and journals.

===Common room and hall===

The college has one common room for fellows and graduate students. The common room has two floors: the upper common room, with an attached terrace overlooking the punting harbour, which has a bar and a coffee counter, and the lower common room, which has magazines and newspapers. The college&#x27;s hall is one of the few in the university to have a common table. The &#x27;Haldane Room&#x27;, a hall adjacent to the dining hall proper, is where formal meals, especially the convocation lunch, are held.

===Gardens===


The college owns grounds on both sides of the river, including two meadows on the opposite side, towards Marston. It has a small but well-maintained garden with mature trees behind its main building, and beside the river. The garden is landscaped well on the riverbank, with a flight of steps leading up to a green-house and a sundial. The college also has a smaller garden beside the Robin Gandy building, which stands on the banks of the river.

===Sports and punting harbour===
The college has its own squash court and croquet lawn, and takes part in many university sporting events, including cricket, football, and the yearly rowing competition. It is one of the few in Oxford with its own punting harbour, with a fleet of punts for use by all members of the college. The Wolfson College Boat Club is on the ground floor of &#x27;C&#x27; Block.

==Academic profile==
Wolfson had approximately 800 graduate students, many of whom were DPhil students. The remainder were studying for MPhil, MSc, MSc by Research, MSt, MSt by Research, MBA, EMBA, MLitt, MLitt by Research, BPhil, and Cert degrees. The college also accepts MJur and BCL candidates.

Wolfson is home to a number of research clusters:

* Ancient World Research Cluster (AWRC)
* Wolfson College Digital Research Cluster
* The Oxford Centre for Life Writing (OCLW)
* Law in Societies
* South Asia Research Cluster (SARC)
* Earth Emergency Research Cluster
* Tibetan and Himalayan Studies Centre
* Quantum Foundations Research Cluster
* The Quantum Hub

It has also been home to the Centre for Socio-Legal Studies, which has now moved to an independent location in Oxford. The Foundation for Law, Justice and Society, which is affiliated with the college and the Centre for Socio-Legal Studies, was based there between 2005 and 2021.

==Notable people associated with Wolfson College==

Wolfson is associated with a number of prominent individuals. These include former students, Fellows of the college and past presidents including two Nobel Prize winners. As Wolfson is a graduate-only college, most students will have been associated with another college or institution, before coming to study at Wolfson College for a Masters or DPhil degree.

===Notable alumni===
In the sciences, alumni of the college include the human geneticist Dame Kay Davies, the astronomer and Caltech professor Richard Ellis, theoretical physicist David Deutsch, mathematician and geneticist Eric Lander and mathematician James R. Norris. Entrepreneurs include Reid Hoffman, who was the co-founder and executive chairman of LinkedIn.

In law and public policy, alumni include Chief Medical Adviser to the UK Government Chris Whitty, former Minister of External Relations of Brazil and Supreme Court Justice Francisco Rezek, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Ahmad Khan. Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, the youngest serving Prime Minister of Iceland, studied at the College.

===Presidents===

<doc id="128392" wikidata="Q3402788" url="?curid=128392" title="Wycliffe Hall, Oxford">
<text>Wycliffe Hall () is a permanent private hall of the University of Oxford affiliated with the Church of England, specialising in philosophy, theology, and religion. It is named after the Bible translator and reformer John Wycliffe, who was master of Balliol College, Oxford in the 14th century.

Founded in 1877, Wycliffe Hall provides theological training to women and men for ordained and lay ministries in the Church of England as well as other Anglican and non-Anglican churches. There are also a number of independent students studying theology, education and philosophy at undergraduate or postgraduate level. The hall is rooted in and has a history of Evangelical Anglicanism and includes strong influences of Charismatic, Conservative and Open Evangelical traditions.

The hall is the third-oldest Anglican theological college and, as of April 2020, claimed to have trained more serving Church of England bishops than any other such institution (21 of c. 116).

==History==
=== Origins ===
For many centuries membership of the University of Oxford required subscription to the 39 Articles (part of the English Reformation heritage of the Church of England). The university was officially secularised by the Oxford University Act 1854 and the Universities Tests Act 1871, when it was opened respectively to students and lecturers of all religious creeds or none. Evangelical public meetings were held in 1876, partly in response to this development, where concerns were raised about how &quot;the majority of clergy are professionally ignorant&quot;. A committee, including Charles Perry and Sydney Gedge MP, was formed to raise funds for two new theological colleges, one at Cambridge and one at Oxford, which would provide supplementary training preparatory to ordination and do so &quot;upon a sound Evangelical and Protestant basis&quot;.

 Funds were gathered rapidly and a founding council was formed for the Oxford college, including J. C. Ryle, Robert Payne Smith, Edward Garbett, and Edmund Knox. The vision was to maintain the teaching of biblical and evangelical theology at Oxford and to promote &quot;doctrinal truth and vital godliness&quot;, training ordinands to be &quot;mighty in scripture...prepared to maintain the pure doctrines of the Reformed Church of England in all their simplicity and fullness&quot;. The new hall was dedicated to John Wycliffe, who was master of Balliol College, Oxford in the 1360s, and is remembered as the &#x27;morning star&#x27; of the Reformation.

Wycliffe is one of more than 20 Anglican theological colleges established in England during the late 19th century – including its &quot;sister college&quot; is Ridley Hall, Cambridge, which opened in 1881. Two evangelical organisations working among Oxford students were founded in the late nineteenth century; the Oxford Inter-Collegiate Christian Union in 1879 and the Oxford Pastorate in 1893. Wycliffe had close links with both from their inception. Indeed, of Wycliffe&#x27;s first 100 students, 83 were Oxford graduates; a link that was bolstered by the second principal, Chavasse, who was incumbent of St Peter-le-Bailey, Oxford prior to leading the hall. The hall opened to non-graduates in 1890.

=== Twentieth century ===

William Henry Griffith Thomas was one of Wycliffe Hall&#x27;s best known principals (serving 1905–1910) and remains a noted theologian. He undertook much of the lecturing in college himself during his tenure and is remembered today by a bronze bust in the dining room.

During the First World War, Wycliffe Hall housed refugees from Serbia and trainees from the Royal Flying Corps who built a practice aeroplane in the dining hall. At the jubilee of the hall in 1927, the principal led students to Jerusalem for their summer vacation term. Wycliffe Hall staff and students conducted four further pilgrimages to Jerusalem, in 1929, 1931, 1934 and 1937, mostly without incident, though during the 1929 trip students were commissioned as peacekeepers during riots and one student was shot through the shoulder. Two further years later, the principal who led these expeditions (F. G. Brown) was elected Protestant Bishop in Jerusalem. Photos from these 1920s expeditions decorate the walls of No. 4 Norham Gardens today. The chapel organ was rebuilt in 1936 and rededicated by the Bishop of Leicester.

Religious liberalism influenced Wycliffe Hall in the 1950s and &#x27;60s. F. J. Taylor (principal 1956–1962) was editor of the liberal-Catholic &quot;Parish and People&quot; magazine, whilst David Anderson (principal 1962–1969) was a contributor to the Modern Churchmen&#x27;s Union. The evangelical churches lost confidence in the hall and student numbers fell dramatically. An official 1965 report on the hall warned that &#x27;dialogue with the present age...must be founded on and spring from evangelical conviction&#x27;. Eventually, the Hall Council asked for Anderson&#x27;s resignation in 1969 and instead sought clearer evangelical leadership, even inviting John Stott to take up the post. Stott declined, but other well-known evangelicals were found to get the hall back onto a firmer footing, including Peter Southwell, David Holloway, Oliver O&#x27;Donovan, and Roger Beckwith.

The centenary of the hall was celebrated in 1977 with a service of thanksgiving at Christ Church, Oxford, followed by tea in a marquee on the Wycliffe lawn. In 1996 Wycliffe Hall became a permanent private hall of the University of Oxford, under the leadership of Alister McGrath.

===Recent developments===
Two significant new programmes were launched in the early years of the new century; SCIO (Scholarship and Christianity in Oxford) in 2002; and OCCA (the Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics) in 2005. SCIO is run in partnership with the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU) whilst OCCA is operated by the RZIM Zacharias Trust. Both programmes brought dozens of students to the hall each year, which SCIO continues to do, though the hall&#x27;s relationship with OCCA was discontinued in 2019. 
Wycliffe became a focus of media attention in 2007 when a significant number of the academic staff left, including the vice-principal and head of pastoral theology. Three former principals wrote to the chair of the Hall Council to protest about the way staff complaints of being bullied were ignored. The crisis continued as a member of the council also resigned, having no confidence in the Chair of Council, Bishop James Jones. The issues became public as members of the academic faculty lodged grievances against the principal, Richard Turnbull, for bullying. After monitoring by the university, senior academics at Oxford complained that the curriculum was narrow and offered students insufficient intellectual development. That year the bishop and the hall were taken to an employment tribunal and admitted breaking the law. In 2009 the hall was inspected by the Bishops&#x27; Inspection: it was commended in some departments but the inspectors expressed &quot;no confidence&quot; in its practical and pastoral theology. Shortly after, the bishop, James Jones, resigned as chair. In May 2012, under a new chair, the Bishop of Chester, the principal was given leave of absence and he stepped down the following month. Late in 2012 the hall began advertising for a new principal who could offer &quot;wide and generous understanding of the major trends in contemporary Anglican evangelicalism, together with high level pastoral skills&quot;. In December 2012 it was announced that Mike Hill, Bishop of Bristol, had become chair of the Hall Council. The process of appointment of a new principal stalled in January 2013: the Hall Council considered that five candidates were &quot;of real quality&quot; but that none of them offered &quot;the desired balance of skills and attributes&quot; required.

 In April 2013 the hall announced that Michael Lloyd, Chaplain of Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, had been appointed as principal, and he took up the position in the middle of the year and has been creatively expanding the hall and looking to increase the numbers of female ordinands.

The small cohorts of first degree undergraduates which Wycliffe accepted from 1997 onwards were phased out in the mid-2010s and, aside from SCIO, the hall now only takes mature students (over 21s).

==Buildings==
Throughout its existence, Wycliffe has been located in the Victorian suburb of North Oxford. A site in the centre of Oxford was sought at the hall&#x27;s foundation, and again in the 1890s, but neither attempt succeeded. The original buildings on the Wycliffe Hall site were designed in the 1860s as family houses, until converted to their present use later in the nineteenth century.
The hall - No. 54 Banbury Road was designed by John Gibbs in 1866 and built for Tom Arnold the younger, literary scholar and son of Tom Arnold the elder, head of Rugby School. The house, named &quot;Laleham&quot;, after the Arnolds&#x27; former residence in Middlesex, was larger than normal, even in a neighbourhood known for substantial houses. This size was to accommodate Arnold&#x27;s anticipated in-house tutees. Within a decade, Arnold decided to sell No. 54 as the tutorial business was abandoned. A committee of evangelical churchmen bought the property in 1877 and promptly renamed it Wycliffe Hall. In the early years, the northerly main room was the library-cum-lecture room, while the southerly one was the dining room. Additions were soon made to the house by William Wilkinson and Harry Wilkinson Moore in 1882–1883. The new North Wing contained a dozen additional student rooms, while South Wing, housed the hall&#x27;s purpose-built library as well as a new front entrance, thus allowing the dining room to be extended into the hall of No. 54. A new purpose-built dining hall was built on the road-side (i.e. west) of No. 54 Banbury Road in 1913, blocking off both of the original main entrances to the hall (the 1866 and 1883 doors), but providing a new front door featuring the hall and university shields in the stonework doorframe, still visible today. South Wing was converted for use as an additional common room (the LCR) in 1974, while the dining hall was converted for use as a lecture theatre in 1980.

Old Lodge - No. 52 Banbury Road lies immediately south of No. 54, at the junction with Norham Gardens, and was designed by Frederick Codd in 1868. It initially housed the Holy Rood Convent (an Anglo-Catholic nunnery of the Society of the Most Holy Trinity, which was involved in printing the works of John Henry Newman). The hall acquired No. 52 when the sisters sold up in 1883. This second villa initially functioned as the principal&#x27;s residence, but in 1930 was converted to contain both student and staff common rooms on the ground floor – hence &#x27;Old&#x27; Lodge. In 1974 the hall&#x27;s library was moved from South Wing into Old Lodge, where it remains to this day.

A chapel and bellcote was added between No. 54 and No. 52 in 1896, designed by architect George Wallace. The chapel was opened by the Bishop of Oxford and has a stained-glass window depicting John Wycliffe. A vestry was added to the south side of the chapel in the 1930s, which is now being used as a prayer room. A 1961 reordering of the east end saw the introduction of candlesticks and altar frontals, which were removed in a later reordering. The 1960s metal reredos cross is now hung in the corridor between the main part of the hall and Old Lodge.
During the twentieth century, a number of houses in Norham Gardens were also acquired by the hall, including No. 2 in 1930 (which date also saw the acquisition of the freeholds from St John&#x27;s College). The gardens of No. 2 and No. 4 remained separately delineated by their original brick party walls for some decades, but these grounds were amalgamated with the garden of 54 Banbury Road to form a large green space on the site in the late 1960s. No. 2 Norham Gardens was used as a replacement lodging for the hall&#x27;s principal through much of the century, but saw use by TocH during the Second World War.

Various schemes were considered in the late 1960s and early 1970s for merging Wycliffe with other institutions, including Mansfield College, Oxford, St Stephen&#x27;s House, Oxford, and Ripon Hall. Options under serious consideration by the Hall Council included the demolition of one or more of the four original villas; operating a split-site college with St Stephen&#x27;s; and selling the original buildings to rebuild on part of Mansfield&#x27;s site or elsewhere in or out of the city. None of these schemes came to pass.

The Talbot Rice Dining Hall was built to the east of No. 54 Banbury Road and opened in October 1980, allowing the 1913 dining hall to become a lecture theatre. At the same time St Stephen&#x27;s House moved to Iffley Road and the Hall Council considered buying No. 17–19 Norham Gardens, but ultimately was out-bid by St Edmund Hall, Oxford. Later in the same decade No. 2a Norham Gardens was built as a new lodging for the principal. The last major building work on the main site was the western extension of No. 2 Norham Gardens in the mid-1990s to provide additional accommodation and offices. No. 8 Norham Gardens was acquired in the early 2000s.

==Ministerial formation==

Ordination training remains central to the work of the hall, whose original purpose was to train men for ordained ministry in both the home and colonial service of the Church of England. Non-ordained ministries are also catered for, especially through courses in academic theology and apologetics. 
Attendance at the daily chapel services is compulsory for full-time ordinands and optional for independent students. For much of the hall&#x27;s history, Greek was a daily ritual for all students; and training in the biblical languages remains important today, with all ministerial students strongly encouraged to take either or both of Greek and Hebrew. Practical ministerial training is delivered via a system of Integrated Study Weeks on topics such as death, evangelism, ethics, and biblical hermeneutics.
Student led fellowship groups supervised by college tutors, which take turns to run a week of chapel services, and training and practice in preaching are key elements of ministerial formation.

Historically, Wycliffe students were assigned a &#x27;pastoral job&#x27; on Sundays – whether preaching, pastoral visiting, or taking a Sunday school class. Today, ministry placements in churches and colleges emphasise observation and theological reflection as well as participation, and a longer summer placement, before a student&#x27;s final year, affords the opportunity to go further afield. Ministerial students also participate in college missions during their studies, with the choice of settings including schools, universities, urban and rural parishes, as well as social projects of various kinds.

==Academic programmes and achievements==

Wycliffe Hall students are enrolled on a wide range of Oxford academic programmes, including the Certificate in Theological Studies, Diploma in Theological Studies, Bachelor of Arts in Theology, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology, Master of Philosophy in Theology, and doctoral programmes. 

In 2012, the hall topped the University of Oxford&#x27;s Norrington Table, winning each of the theology prizes and with all five BA students achieving a first class degree. The hall topped the Norrington Table again in 2017.

==Student life==

The modern student body includes about 60 Church of England ordinands and about 60 independent students, plus up to 50 visiting students (mostly on the SCIO programme). Many nationalities are represented, with the largest single body of overseas students being from the United States. The Buechner prize for creative writing, named in honour of the acclaimed American author Frederick Buechner, is awarded annually. Students may also take part in activities across the wider university, including sports. For full-time students there is some student accommodation on-site, and students may take eat in the dining hall on weekdays. There are three or four formal dinners per term. All ministerial students are expected to take on at least one &#x27;college duty&#x27;. Activities for spouses of students include a mid-week prayer, Bible study and fellowship meeting.

<text>North Wilkesboro is a town in Wilkes County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 4,131 at the 2020 US Census. North Wilkesboro is the birthplace and original home of Lowe&#x27;s Home Improvement, which continues to have a major presence in the community. The town is also known as one of the birthplaces of the sport of stock-car racing, and the North Wilkesboro Speedway was the first NASCAR-sanctioned track. Due to the town&#x27;s proximity to the nearby Blue Ridge Mountains and its numerous tourist venues, North Wilkesboro has been nicknamed the &quot;Key to the Blue Ridge&quot;.

==History==
North Wilkesboro was founded in 1891 when the Norfolk and Southern Railroad built a railroad line into Wilkes County. The line ended on the northern bank of the Yadkin River opposite Wilkesboro, the county seat. The town of North Wilkesboro quickly developed around the railroad tracks. North Wilkesboro was home of the Carolina Mirror Company, which for many years was the largest mirror factory in the United States. Lowe&#x27;s Foods, one of the Southeast&#x27;s largest supermarket chains, was started in North Wilkesboro in 1954. Lowe&#x27;s Home Improvement Warehouse, the nation&#x27;s second-largest chain of home-improvement stores, was started in North Wilkesboro in 1946. Like many small towns and cities in rural North Carolina, North Wilkesboro has suffered since 2000 from the closing of nearly all of its textile and furniture factories, which have moved to low-wage locations in Latin America and Asia. The factories were a major part of the town&#x27;s economic base.

The North Wilkesboro Speedway, located just outside the city limits, predates the founding of NASCAR; the speedway held its first race on May 18, 1947 and from there it grew in popularity. On October 16, 1949, the Speedway held the 8th and final race of the 1949 NASCAR Strictly Stock Division; when the race was over Robert &quot;Red&quot; Byron had become the first NASCAR-sanctioned champion. The North Wilkesboro Speedway held NASCAR races for 50 years; on September 29, 1996 Jeff Gordon would win the final race to be held at the speedway. In 1995, following the death of the long-time owner and track founder Enoch Staley, the speedway was purchased by two new owners, Bob Bahre and Bruton Smith. Soon after their purchase, both men announced that they were closing the speedway and moving its two NASCAR race dates to their new tracks in Texas and New Hampshire. The decision met with strong criticism from race fans. From the track&#x27;s closure in 1996 through 2021 numerous national and regional news media stories discussed the physical decay of the track and grandstands, the rich history of the track, and efforts to renovate and reopen the speedway. In November 2021, the North Carolina state legislature and NC Governor Roy Cooper gave $18 million to the speedway for extensive repairs and renovations in a major effort to reopen the track for racing. Following the renovations, in August 2022 the speedway held its first races in a decade, drawing a sellout crowd to the CARS Tours Window&#x27;s World 125. In September 2022 it was announced that the 2023 NASCAR All-Star Race would be held in May 2023 at the North Wilkesboro Speedway, marking the first NASCAR race to be held at the track since its closure in 1996.

Located a few miles away, the W. Kerr Scott Dam and Reservoir offers its visitors a pristine wilderness to go mountain biking, boating, swimming, camping, picnicking, hunting, and fishing around its shoreline. The Town of North Wilkesboro is located in the heart of Wilkes County, North Carolina in the northwestern corner of the state. Wilkes County is bordered by eight (8) counties. These include the counties of Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Caldwell, Iredell, Surry, Watauga, and Yadkin; thus making the town conveniently juxtaposed to eight county seats and economic hubs; all within a 45-minute drive from town. The town corporate limits cover approximately 7.5 square miles (~ 4,800 acres) of contiguous property with approximately 300 acres in satellite territories. The Extraterritorial Jurisdiction (ETJ) encompasses roughly or 10,240 acres. The town is bordered to the south by the Yadkin River and the Town of Wilkesboro. Running through the eastern portion of the town is the Reddies River which flows from North to South and unites with the Yadkin. Hoopers Branch, a tributary to the Reddies River, rises on the north side of North Wilkesboro.

==Transportation==

I-77 serves as the nearest major interstate to the county in addition to the town itself. North Wilkesboro is also in close proximity to NC Highway 16 which runs through Wilkesboro.

===Public transportation===

North Wilkesboro and Wilkes County are served by the Wilkes Transportation Authority, known commonly as the WTA. The WTA provides Wilkes with its only scheduled public transportation service as well providing rural communities within the county with transportation by booking in advance.

==Climate==
North Wilkesboro rests in the foothills to the east of the Blue Ridge escarpment; which encompasses the western edge of Wilkes County. The town&#x27;s position in relation to the abutting mountain system accounts for the mild, yet wet winters and summers. The average annual maximum temperature is 68.7 degrees Fahrenheit with a corresponding minimum annual temperature average of 45.7 degrees. Average annual rainfall (49.6 inches) for the town falls just short of the typical average of the Southern Appalachian region (60.0+ inches). As winter clouds approach from the west and migrate across the Blue Ridge, an orographic effect ensues which releases an amount of snow in the Western high country, leaving little for central and eastern Wilkes County as the systems pass over. The result is more of a wintry mix of sleet and frozen rain, hence the 5.9 inches of average total snowfall, but the lack of any snow depth. North Wilkesboro has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and the hardiness zone is 7B.

<text>Wilkesboro is a town in and the county seat of Wilkes County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 3,687 at the 2020 census. The town is located along the south bank of the Yadkin River, directly opposite the town of North Wilkesboro.

==History ==
Wilkesboro was founded in 1800 and quickly designated as the county seat.

The town is built atop a low, broad ridge which runs for over a mile along the south bank of the Yadkin River. 

For many decades a popular historic spot in Wilkesboro was the &quot;Tory Oak&quot;, a large oak tree from which Colonel Benjamin Cleveland, a well-known Wilkes County patriot during the American Revolutionary War, hanged Loyalist militia leaders who supported the British king and opposed American independence from Britain. The oak was located behind the old Wilkes County courthouse.

During the Civil War, many of Wilkesboro&#x27;s residents remained loyal to the Union and opposed the Confederacy. In March 1865, General George Stoneman, a Union cavalry leader, led a raid through the town.

Shortly after the war ended, Tom Dula (Dooley), a Confederate veteran, was tried and hanged for the murder of his fiancée, Laura Foster. Many people were convinced that one of Dula&#x27;s jealous ex-girlfriends murdered Foster, and that Dula was innocent of the crime. Dula&#x27;s story was turned into a top-selling ballad in 1958 by The Kingston Trio, titled &quot;Tom Dooley&quot;. The story was subsequently turned into a 1959 movie starring Michael Landon as Dula. Each summer, the Wilkes Playmakers present a popular play based on the story.

The Robert Cleveland Log House, Downtown Wilkesboro Historic District, Federal Building, J. T. Ferguson Store, Thomas B. Finley Law Office, J. L. Hemphill House, Johnson-Hubbard House, Old Wilkes County Jail, St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church and Cemetery, Wilkes County Courthouse, Wilkesboro Presbyterian Church, and Wilkesboro-Smithey Hotel are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The history of the city of Wilson began with a community that formed around Toisnot Primitive Baptist Church, built in the early 1800s. The community was originally called Toisnot.

That stimulated growth of the community.

The North Carolina General Assembly chartered the Town of Wilson. It was named for state senator , U.S. Volunteers. He died of fever while on leave from the State senate during the Mexican–American War of 1848. Messrs. Joshua Barnes, John W. Farmer, James D. Barnes, Dylan Dieterle, Jonathan D.

The city has built its own Government-access television (GATV) municipal cable TV provider known as Greenlight, which provides cable TV, digital phone and internet to its residents.

Since then, Greenlight has grown to provide services to more than 6,000 residential customers and businesses and the Wilson County School System. In addition, Greenlight provides free wireless Internet access throughout the downtown Wilson area. In 2013 Wilson was the first city in North Carolina to offer gigabit Internet connectivity service to its residents via a fiber optic network. That service allows Internet users to upload or download data at speeds up to one billion bits per second.

FCC&quot;.

<doc id="128405" wikidata="Q1369280" url="?curid=128405" title="South Gloucestershire">
<text>South Gloucestershire is a unitary authority area in the ceremonial county of Gloucestershire, South West England. Towns in the area include Yate, Chipping Sodbury, Kingswood, Thornbury, Filton, Patchway and Bradley Stoke. The southern part of its area falls within the Greater Bristol urban area surrounding the city of Bristol.

South Gloucestershire was created in 1996 to replace the Northavon district of the abolished county of Avon. It is separate from Gloucestershire County Council, but is part of the ceremonial county and shares Gloucestershire&#x27;s Lord Lieutenant (the Sovereign&#x27;s representative to the county). Because of its history as part of the county of Avon, South Gloucestershire works closely with the other unitary authorities that took over when that county was abolished, including shared services such as Avon Fire and Rescue Service and Avon and Somerset Police, together with co-operation in planning strategy for transport, roads and housing.

==History==
Prior to the implementation of the Local Government Act 1972 on 1 April 1974, the area that now forms South Gloucestershire formed part of the shire county of Gloucestershire, comprising the urban districts of Kingswood and Mangotsfield and the Rural Districts of Warmley, Sodbury and Thornbury. However, under the terms of that act, the area was removed from Gloucestershire, and became part of the county of Avon, forming the districts of Kingswood and Northavon.

In 1996, the county of Avon was abolished, and South Gloucestershire was created as a unitary authority area comprising the former districts of Kingswood and Northavon. The area borders the city and county of Bristol, the Bath and North East Somerset unitary authority area, and the shire counties of Gloucestershire and Wiltshire.

The geographic area currently known as South Gloucestershire should not be confused with Southern Gloucestershire. Nor should organisations or bodies in the past titled &#x27;South Gloucestershire&#x27; (meaning Southern Gloucestershire) be confused with the area covered by the unitary authority.

==Demographic==
At the 2001 census, the population of South Gloucestershire was 245,641.

At the 2011 census, the population had increased to 262,767.

At the 2021 census, the population estimate for South Gloucestershire is 290,400.

According to the 2001 census estimates, 97.6 percent of the population was described as white, 0.8 percent as dual heritage, 0.7 percent as Asian or Asian British, 0.4 percent as Black or Black British and 0.5 percent as Chinese or other.

Much of the population is in towns that form the &#x27;suburbs&#x27; to the north and east of Bristol. There are also the large towns of Yate and its neighbour Chipping Sodbury, Thornbury, the large villages of Winterbourne and Frampton Cotterell, Wickwar, Alveston, Olveston and Tockington.

==Economy==

The main employers are the local authority with 9,500 people and the Ministry of Defence Headquarters for Defence Procurement and the Naval Support Command with 7,000 employees. Other key employers include Airbus, Rolls-Royce and the Royal Mail, which dominates the Filton-Patchway area of South Gloucestershire. Friends Provident and Hewlett-Packard also have major offices in nearby Stoke Gifford.

Many employers operate in the heavily developed area between the northern edge of Bristol and the M5 motorway, an area sometimes described as the North Fringe of Bristol. This includes the Cribbs Causeway shopping centre, comprising The Mall regional shopping centre and the surrounding retail parks. East of Patchway are the Aztec West and Almondsbury business parks either side of the A38, extending to Bradley Stoke and the M4/M5 Almondsbury Interchange. Employers with sites in this area include EE and the RAC.

==Education==

South Gloucestershire is home to 99 primary schools, 16 secondary schools, and post-16 colleges and centres. There is one university, the University of the West of England, which was a former polytechnic. In 2008, DCSF figures revealed that there was a 6.6% overall absence in the district&#x27;s secondary schools, whilst 7.4% is the national average.

In 2005, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer recognised the City of Bristol&#x27;s ties to science and technology by naming it one of six &quot;science cities&quot;, and promising funding for further development of science in the city, with a £300 million science park planned at Emersons Green, in South Gloucestershire.

==Media==
The area is served by BBC West and ITV West Country broadcasting from the Mendip TV transmitter. 

Radio stations for the area are:

BBC Local Radio 
*BBC Radio Bristol 
Independent Radio
*Heart West 
*Greatest Hits Radio Bristol &amp; The South West

==Geography==
The River Severn forms the north-western edge of the area, with a wide coastal plain terminated by an escarpment. East of this is the wide River Frome Valley drainage area. Further east is another escarpment running roughly north–south, passing between Yate and Chipping Sodbury and west of Pucklechurch. The Cotswolds Escarpment forms the eastern edge of South Gloucestershire, while the western half is mainly urbanised.

A small part of the Cotswolds and the National Trust site of Dyrham Park are also in the district. South of the motorways are suburbs of Bristol while areas north are rural. Some of the inner green belts have been taken away by developments like the new town of Bradley Stoke.

==Transport==

Many areas of South Gloucestershire have easy commuting access to Bristol (via the A38 and M32) and to Bath, as well as westward to South Wales and Cardiff via the two Severn bridges. The M5 and M4 motorways provide access to Gloucester and London. Bristol&#x27;s northern and eastern ring road, the A4174, passes through South Gloucestershire. The Metrobus express bus network extends from Bristol into South Gloucestershire, and is supported by the district council.

The area also has an important and well used railway network, with many direct routes to towns and cities across the UK. This includes eastward to London and westward through the Severn Tunnel to Cardiff and the rest of South Wales. There are also routes to the South-West counties and north to England&#x27;s second city, Birmingham. Many routes cross in Stoke Gifford at Bristol Parkway station. There are six stations within the district, mainly located near the border with Bristol in the west of the district.

==Democracy==
The Conservatives held an overall majority on the council from 2015 until 2023; previously no party had overall control, except for 1999–2003 when the Liberal Democrats had a majority. After the 2023 elections, Labour and the Liberal Democrats formed a coalition which took control of the council, this being Labour&#x27;s first time in control and the Liberal Democrats for the first time in twenty years.

In 2012, it became one of the first authorities in the UK to return to a Committee System, abolishing the single party Cabinet, as allowed under the Localism Act. This was later reverted to a leader and cabinet system in 2017 during the Conservative majority.

For Westminster elections, the area is covered by three constituencies, all lying within the authority boundary. These are:
* Thornbury and Yate (&quot;county&quot;)
* Filton and Bradley Stoke (&quot;county&quot;)
* Kingswood (&quot;borough)&quot;
&quot;County/Borough is a legal term denoting the type of constituency. County is a rural area, Borough is an urban area.&quot;

<doc id="128409" wikidata="Q1080184" url="?curid=128409" title="Predestination in Calvinism">
<text>Predestination is a doctrine in Calvinism dealing with the question of the control that God exercises over the world. In the words of the Westminster Confession of Faith, God &quot;freely and unchangeably ordained whatsoever comes to pass.&quot; The second use of the word &quot;predestination&quot; applies this to salvation, and refers to the belief that God appointed the eternal destiny of some to salvation by grace, while leaving the remainder to receive eternal damnation for all their sins, even their original sin. The former is called &quot;unconditional election&quot;, and the latter &quot;reprobation&quot;. In Calvinism, some people are predestined and effectually called in due time (regenerated/born again) to faith by God, all others are reprobated.

Calvinism places more emphasis on election compared to other branches of Christianity.
==Origins==

Predestination of the elect and non-elect was taught by the Jewish Essene sect, Gnosticism, and Manichaeism. In Christianity, the doctrine that God unilaterally predestines some persons to heaven and some to hell originated with Augustine of Hippo during the Pelagian controversy in 412 AD. Pelagius and his followers taught that people are not born with original sin and can choose to be good or evil. The controversy caused Augustine to radically reinterpret the teachings of the apostle Paul, arguing that faith is a free gift from God rather than something humans can choose. Noting that not all will hear or respond to God&#x27;s offered covenant, Augustine considered that &quot;the more general care of God for the world becomes particularised in God&#x27;s care for the elect&quot;. He explicitly defended God&#x27;s justice in sending newborn and stillborn babies to hell if they died without baptism.

==Double predestination==
Double predestination is the idea that not only does God choose some to be saved, he also creates some people who will be damned.

Some modern Calvinists respond to the ethical dilemma of double predestination by explaining that God&#x27;s active predestination is only for the elect. God provides grace to the elect causing salvation, but for the damned God withholds salvific grace. Calvinists teach that God remains just and fair in creating persons he predestines to damnation because although God unilaterally works in the elect producing regeneration, God does not actively force the damned to sin. 

Double predestination may not be the view of any of the Reformed confessions, which speak of God passing over rather than actively reprobating the damned. However, John Calvin rejected such a position, stating: &quot;This they do ignorantly and childishly since there could be no election without its opposite reprobation ... whom God passes by he reprobates, and that for no other cause but because he is pleased to exclude them from the inheritance which he predestines to his children.&quot;

Scholars have disagreed over whether Heinrich Bullinger accepted the doctrine of double predestination. Frank A. James says that he rejected it, preferring a view called &quot;single predestination&quot; where God elects some to salvation, but does not in any way predestine to reprobation. Cornelis Venema, on the other hand, argues that &quot;Bullinger did not consistently articulate a doctrine of single predestination,&quot; and defended double predestination on a few occasions.

===Calvin&#x27;s writings===

John Calvin taught double predestination. He wrote the foundational work on this topic, &quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion&quot; (1539), while living in Strasbourg after his expulsion from Geneva and consulting regularly with the Reformed theologian Martin Bucer. Calvin&#x27;s belief in the uncompromised &quot;sovereignty of God&quot; spawned his doctrines of providence and predestination. For the world, without providence it would be &quot;unlivable&quot;. For individuals, without predestination &quot;no one would be saved&quot;.

Calvin&#x27;s doctrine of providence is straightforward. &quot;All events whatsoever are governed by the secret counsel of God.&quot; Therefore, &quot;nothing happens but what [God] has knowingly and willingly decreed.&quot; This excludes &quot;fortune and chance.&quot; Calvin applied his doctrine of providence concerning &quot;all events&quot; to individuals and their salvation in his doctrine of predestination.

Calvin opened his exposition of predestination with an &quot;actual fact&quot;. The &quot;actual fact&quot; that Calvin observed was that even among those to whom &quot;the covenant of life&quot; is preached, it does not gain the same acceptance. Although, &quot;all are called to repentance and faith&quot;, in fact, &quot;the spirit of repentance and faith is not given to all&quot;.

Calvin turned to the teachings of Jesus for a theological interpretation of the diversity that some people accept the &quot;covenant of life&quot; and some do not. Pointing to the Parable of the Sower, Calvin observed, &quot;it is no new thing for the seed to fall among thorns or in stony places&quot;. In Jesus&#x27; teaching in John 6:65 that &quot;no one can come to me unless it has been granted him by my Father&quot;, Calvin found the key to his theological interpretation of the diversity.

For Calvin&#x27;s biblically-based theology, this diversity reveals the &quot;unsearchable depth of the divine judgment&quot;, a judgment &quot;subordinate to God&#x27;s purpose of eternal election&quot;. God offers salvation to some, but not to all. To many this seems a perplexing subject, because they deem it &quot;incongruous that ... some should be predestinated to salvation, and others to destruction&quot;. However, Calvin asserted that the incongruity can be resolved by proper views concerning &quot;election and predestination&quot;.

Thus, Calvin based his theological description of people as &quot;predestinated to life or to death&quot; on biblical authority and &quot;actual fact&quot;. Calvin noted that Scripture requires that we &quot;consider this great mystery&quot; of predestination, but he also warned against unrestrained &quot;human curiosity&quot; regarding it. For believers, knowing that &quot;the cause of our salvation did not proceed from us, but from God alone&quot; evokes gratitude.

===Reprobation: active decree, passive foreordination===
Calvinists emphasise the &quot;active&quot; nature of God&#x27;s decree to choose those foreordained to eternal wrath, yet at the same time the &quot;passive&quot; nature of that foreordination.

This is possible because most Calvinists hold to an infralapsarian view of God&#x27;s decree. In that view, God, before Creation, in his mind, first decreed that the Fall of Man would take place, before decreeing election and reprobation. So God actively chooses whom to condemn, but because he knows they will have a sinful nature, the way he foreordains them is to simply let them be – this is sometimes called &quot;preterition.&quot; Therefore, this foreordination to wrath is passive in nature (unlike God&#x27;s active predestination of his elect where he needs to overcome their sinful nature).

===Equal ultimacy===

The Westminster Confession of Faith, uses different words for the act of God&#x27;s election and reprobation: &quot;predestinated&quot; and &quot;foreordained&quot; respectively. This suggests that the two do not operate in the same way. The term &quot;equal ultimacy&quot; is sometimes used of the view that the two decrees are symmetrical: God works equally to keep the elect in heaven and the reprobate out of heaven. This view is sometimes erroneously referred to as &quot;double predestination&quot;, on which see above. R. C. Sproul argues against this position on the basis that it implies God &quot;actively intervenes to work sin&quot; in the lives of the reprobate. Robert L. Reymond, however, insists on equal ultimacy of election and reprobation in the divine decree, though he suggests that &quot;we must not speak of an exact identity of divine causality behind both.&quot;

Calvinists hold that even if their scheme is characterized as a form of determinism, it is one which insists upon the free agency and moral responsibility of the individual. Additionally, they hold that the will is in bondage to sin and therefore unable to actualize its true freedom. Hence, an individual whose will is enslaved to sin cannot choose to serve God. Since Calvinists further hold that salvation is by grace apart from good works (&quot;sola gratia&quot;) and since they view making a choice to trust God as an action or work, they maintain that the act of choosing cannot be the difference between salvation and damnation, as in the Arminian scheme. Rather, God must first free the individual from his enslavement to sin to a greater degree than in Arminianism, and then the regenerated heart naturally chooses the good. This work by God is sometimes called irresistible, in the sense that grace enables a person to freely cooperate, being set free from the desire to do the opposite, so that cooperation is not the cause of salvation but the other way around.

==Barthian views==

20th century Reformed theologian Karl Barth reinterpreted the Reformed doctrine of predestination. For Barth, God elects Christ as rejected and chosen man. Individual people are not the subjects of election, but are elected or rejected by virtue of their being in Christ. Interpreters of Barth such as Shirley Guthrie have called this a &quot;Trinitarian&quot; as opposed to a &quot;speculative&quot; view of predestination. According to Guthrie, God freely loves all people, and his just condemnation of sinners is motivated by love and a desire for reconciliation.

==History==

===Native American settlement===
One of the most significant Native American excavation sites in North Carolina is located near the Yadkin River west of the town of Donnaha. Donnaha was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on December 6, 1978. Experts from Wake Forest University believe this was the site of a village of at least 100 Sioux Indians dating to the late Woodland Period.

Earl Norman, an East Bend artifact collector, donated 5,000 pieces of his collection of more than 10,000 relics to the North Carolina Department of Archives and History in 1960.

===Establishment of town===
East Bend was first known as Banner&#x27;s Store. It was named for merchant Martin Luther Banner. Early settler Martin Luther Banner later moved west and founded Banner Elk, North Carolina.

On March 7, 1887, the General Assembly incorporated the town of East Bend and named it after the east bend of the Yadkin River. Officers were mayor J.H Johnson; commissioners Dr. Evan Benbow, J.H. Jenkins, J.A. Martin, Dr. W.E. Benbow, and J.G. Huff; and constable J.M. Whittington.

J.G. Huff established the first buggy-manufacturing business in town in 1873. The Huff Buggy Factory, built in 1893, was said to be the largest buggy factory in the South. Huff closed the buggy works about 1920 and began operating a funeral home, which is still owned and operated by his heirs.

&quot;The Yadkin Ripple&quot;, a weekly newspaper still published in Yadkin County, began in East Bend in 1896.

In 1904, the town&#x27;s population was 444 and it boasted a hotel, two buggy factories, a tobacco bag factory, a bank, and several stores. However, a decision by the Southern Railroad to bypass the town 1890 put a damper on the town&#x27;s growth. Roger Moore, now a film critic for &quot;The Orlando Sentinel&quot;, compared East Bend to Lake Wobegon, &quot;It&#x27;s a homey town with a lot of history and a few &#x27;might-have-beens,&#x27; &quot; Moore wrote in &quot;The Winston-Salem Journal&quot;.

The Yadkin County Agricultural Fair was held in East Bend from 1914 until 1978. The fair was first held at the old schoolhouse and in later years was moved to a tract east of town on North Carolina Highway 67. The fairgrounds were later converted to a community softball park.

==Education==

===Public schools===
Most children in town attend East Bend Elementary School, a kindergarten through sixth-grade public community school at N.C. Highway 67 Bypass and Flint Hill Road. The school traces its history back to the East Bend Academy, which operated from 1856-1889. In 1890, it became known as Union High School. Most of the high school and its records burned in 1964. It was rebuilt at the site and became an elementary-only school after countywide consolidation in 1967.

East Bend is one of five feeder schools for Forbush High School and the newly built middle school, which is located in the ZIP code area of East Bend south of town. Two other elementary schools are located in the East Bend ZIP code area, Forbush and Fall Creek.

==Attractions==
* Yadkin Islands Park, part of Pilot Mountain State Park, is located about two miles north of town.
* Davis Brothers Store, which was a general store in the early 20th century on Main Street, has been renovated and is now an Italian restaurant. Scenes from &quot;Two Soldiers&quot;, which won the 2004 Academy Award for best live action short film, were filmed in front of Davis Brothers and the old Morse and Wade Building, a turn-of the century building that was on the National Registry but torn down in 2006.
* East Bend is located in the Yadkin Valley AVA, an American Viticultural Area. 
* In addition to the Davis Brothers Store, the Donnaha Site and Morse and Wade Building are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Jonesville, originally called Allen&#x27;s Settlement, is the oldest town in Yadkin County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 2,285 at the 2010 census. The town grew by nearly 800 residents in 2001 when it merged with neighboring Arlington. Recognized as the Heart of the Yadkin Valley, Jonesville is a gateway to the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Yadkin Valley Heritage/Cultural Corridor and to local wineries in the Swan Creek AVA and the larger Yadkin Valley AVA, as well as offering access to the Yadkin river.

==Overview==

The town, situated on the south bank of the Yadkin River, lies beneath Daniel Boone&#x27;s hunting trails through the Brushy Mountains, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Visitors are served by a state-of-the-art Welcome Center. With retail and specialty shops/services in the immediate area, Jonesville offers an expanding antique mall at exit 83. Within five miles are regional sky diving facilities, an international motorcycle manufacturing plant, a restoration center for vintage cars, a popular herb farm, a History Center and historic park, a medieval reenactment center and a horse ranch specializing in riding lessons and mustang rehabilitation.

Seven local hotels, multiple fast food and conventional restaurants and gas stations are located near I-77 exits (83 and 79). Jonesville offers convenient access to athletic, college, cultural and recreational resources in larger Piedmont cities such as Winston-Salem, Statesville and Charlotte.

A military out-post during the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, Jonesville is not a typical &quot;Interstate town.&quot; Currently working to preserve its history, it is home to an historic Bicentennial Park (Mineral Springs Park) featuring a Tri-County Veterans&#x27; Memorial with 3,000+ names of those who have served our nation since pre-Revolutionary War conflicts. The Mineral Springs Park, located along the Yadkin River, was once a respite where multiple wilderness trails converged, approximating highways 67 and 21 through Yadkin County. A recreational park (Swaim Park) with playgrounds, ball fields, tennis courts, walking trails, picnic areas and bandstand adjoin a Senior Center and a Medical Center.

A GreenWay along the Yadkin River is under development. Future plans include reconstructing a functional ferry that operated during the Civil War and establishing a walking trail along the historic woodland routes that converged in historic Mineral Springs Park.

The Yadkin River divides Jonesville and Elkin. The area is referred to as the Tri-County (Surry, Wilkes, Yadkin) Region and is located in the Yadkin Valley AVA, an American Viticultural Area. Wines made from grapes grown in the Yadkin Valley AVA may use the appellation Yadkin Valley on their labels. At least a dozen wineries are located within of the town.

==History==

===Early history===
Jonesville is Yadkin County&#x27;s oldest town and was at one time the largest town west of Raleigh, according to &quot;An Illustrated History of Yadkin County 1950-1980,&quot; by William E. Rutledge Jr. Initially called Allen&#x27;s Settlement, after the owner of an early iron ore forge, the settlement was established behind a towering, protective bluff above the south bank of the Yadkin River. It soon became a commercial hub for the region, featuring a trading post, a tannery, medical personnel, a school, grist and lumber mills, a cotton mill and a garrison overlooking the Yadkin Valley that served as an outpost for local militia during the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. Although a contemporary designation aligns the overmountain trail-head in an adjoining Surry County community, Allen&#x27;s Settlement—formerly located in Surry County—is now recognized as part of the OverMountain Trail. Based on family journals and oral history, Allen&#x27;s Settlement and historic Mineral Springs Park are identified as a mustering site for patriots who marched to defeat the British at Kings Mountain.

Allen&#x27;s Settlement was incorporated as Martinsborough in 1811, but the name was later changed to Jonesville in honor of Hardy Jones (1747–1819). Jones fought in the American Revolution and was instrumental in bringing the Jonesville Male and Female Academy to Jonesville. A marker to Hardy Jones is on the lawn of Jonesville United Methodist Church.

In addition to the timber and iron ore markets, the town also grew around the Jonesville Male and Female Academy, according to Rutledge. The Academy was affiliated with the North Carolina Conference of the Methodist Church. The Rev. William L. Van Eaton, who was born in Davie County, was principal of the school at its peak in 1859. In its history, the Academy attracted numerous scholars of the era, including Bishop Francis Asbury and Brantley York, subsequent founder of Trinity-Union Institute, which was later named Duke University.

On April 1, 1865, troops commanded by Union Brigadier General George Stoneman and Colonel Alvan C. Gillem devastated the town and the Academy in their search for Confederate soldiers and supplies. In the Academy, they broke chandeliers and destroyed school equipment. This marked the end of the school.

Gillem&#x27;s troops, known as &quot;home Yankees,&quot; also ransacked businesses and chased away teachers and military-aged men. Union troops had been told the town was a haven for Confederate spies and military supplies. They failed to find evidence of an Underground Railroad for escaping slaves and deserting soldiers, assumed to be located in private homes and the iron ore caves in Jonesville. The town never fully recovered.

One of the last pieces of early town history, a house once occupied by Van Eaton that dated back to the 1830s, was torn down in 1996. At the time, it was believed to be the oldest house in town.

On December 21, 1912, two elderly women and a young girl were killed and nearly 100 people were injured after the floor of the Jonesville High School auditorium collapsed during a Christmas concert. As the floor of the second-floor auditorium gave way in the center, the audience of at least 300 people dropped to the first floor. Killed were: Nancy Swaim, Mrs. William Smith and Lexie Luffman, a 12-year-old girl. Sam Ray extinguished a fire in a stove in the auditorium as the floor began to collapse, saving many lives (Winston-Salem Journal).

===Recent history===
The town experienced unprecedented growth after Interstate 77 opened in 1974. The intersection of Interstate 77 and N.C. 67 (Winston Road) on the east side of town is a popular stop for travelers. It is one of the most developed along the interstate between Statesville and Mount Airy.

In 1980, Jonesville was named a &quot;Governor&#x27;s Community of Excellence&quot; by Governor Jim Hunt for its economic development work.

Jonesville Police Sgt. Gregory Keith Martin was shot to death on October 5, 1996, on I-77. The case, which has been solved, received national attention on TV&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; in May 2005, January 2006 and June 2006. Martin was the town&#x27;s first police officer to be shot in the line of duty. On October 3, 2012, 36-year-old Scott Vincent Sica was arrested in Cape Coral, Florida, and charged with first-degree murder. In 2009 The town put up a memorial to Sgt. Martin in front of the new town Hall. Every year there is a memorial ride through Jonesville to honor Sgt. Martin.

In 2009, the town built a multimillion-dollar town hall.

<text>Burnsville is a town that serves as the county seat of Yancey County, North Carolina, United States. Located in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina, sits in the shadow of Mount Mitchell, the highest peak in the Eastern Continental United States. The population was 1,612 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
The town was founded on March 6, 1834, from land conveyed by John &quot;Yellow Jacket&quot; Bailey, and it was named after Captain Otway Burns, a naval hero of the War of 1812. In 1909, a statue of Captain Burns was given to the town by his grandson, Walter Francis Burns Sr., and it was set on a granite pedestal in the center of the town square. It has an inscription that reads, in part, &quot;He Guarded Well Our Seas, Let Our Mountains Honor Him.&quot; Due to damages, the original statue was replaced in the early 2000s.

On April 6, 2010, Burnsville, the only incorporated town within Yancey County, held a referendum providing for the legal sale of alcohol within the town limits. The referendum passed. After applying for and receiving the applicable permits, Burnsville now operates an ABC store; some retail establishments now sell beer and wine; and a few restaurants sell beer, wine, and mixed drinks. Graham County is the last remaining fully dry county in the state of North Carolina.

In September 2024, Burnsville and the surrounding area was heavily impacted by Hurricane Helene and subsequent storm-induced landslides, resulting in devastating property and infrastructure damage to Yancey, Mitchell, and Avery Counties. Officials reported the damages and repairs to the area to be over $50 billion.

One of the oldest buildings is the Nu-Wray Inn. It was built in 1833 and now, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The Parkway Playhouse, the oldest continually operating summer stock theater company in North Carolina, is located in Burnsville. It was founded in 1947 by W. R. Taylor, a professor of drama from the Woman&#x27;s College of North Carolina-now the University of North Carolina-Greensboro, and a group of dedicated community leaders. Several other structures in Burnsvile are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. They include the Bald Creek Historic District, Chase-Coletta House, Citizens Bank Building, John Wesley McElroy House, Yancey Collegiate Institute Historic District, and Yancey County Courthouse.

== Annual fair ==

The Mt. Mitchell Craft Fair is held in Burnsville. This annual event, founded in 1956, attracts thousands of tourists and more than 200 vendors and performers. The fair is known for the local and visiting artisans who exhibit their handmade arts and crafts.

Established in 1956, The Mount Mitchell Arts &amp; Crafts Fair is coordinated and sponsored by the Burnsville-Yancey Chamber of Commerce. It is the first Friday and Saturday in August in historic downtown Burnsville and features more than 200 vendors and performers. The event includes bluegrass and acoustic music, food vendors, and a unique selection of handmade arts and crafts from artisans across the country.

The city was founded in 1907 along the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s transcontinental rail line known as the Pacific Extension. Before being named Bucyrus in 1908, the city was called first Wolf Butte and then Dolan, which was ultimately rejected due to similarity with Doland, South Dakota. The new name Bucyrus was taken from the Bucyrus Company steam shovels used to build the railroad grade within the city.

In 1922 a cyclone hit and destroyed the home of the Herbert and Ruth Spencer family in Bucyrus, killing three and injuring three. After the storm, the surviving family members could not find the baby, Shirley, 13 months old. A search party finally found baby Shirley the next day, sleeping soundly among bricks from the chimney in a wheat field half a mile from the home. For the rest of her life, Shirley Spencer was known as &quot;the Cyclone Baby.&quot;

The town was struck by a wind-fueled wildfire on October 18, 2012. Much of the town was destroyed and 26 people were displaced.

<text>Thomas Carlyle (4 December 17955 February 1881) was a Scottish essayist, historian, philosopher, and a leading writer of the Victorian era. He strongly influenced 19th-century art, literature, and philosophy.

Carlyle was born in Ecclefechan, a village in Dumfriesshire, and attended the University of Edinburgh, where he excelled in mathematics, inventing the Carlyle circle. After finishing the arts course, he prepared to become a minister in the Burgher Church while working as a schoolmaster. He quit these and several other endeavours before settling on literature, writing for the &quot;Edinburgh Encyclopædia&quot; and working as a translator. He found initial success as a disseminator of German literature, then little-known to English readers, through his translations, his &quot;Life of Friedrich Schiller&quot; (1825), and his review essays for various journals. His first major work was a novel entitled &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; (1833–34). 

Carlyle relocated to London, where he became famous with his &quot;French Revolution&quot; (1837) which prompted the collection and reissue of his essays as &quot;Miscellanies&quot;. Each of his subsequent works was highly regarded throughout Europe and North America, including &quot;On Heroes&quot; (1841), &quot;Past and Present&quot; (1843), &quot;Cromwell&#x27;s Letters&quot; (1845), &quot;Latter-Day Pamphlets&quot; (1850), and &quot;History of Frederick the Great&quot; (1858–65). He founded the London Library, contributed significantly to the creation of the National Portrait Galleries in London and in Edinburgh, was elected Lord Rector of the University of Edinburgh in 1865, and received the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot; in 1874, amongst other honours.

Carlyle occupied a central position in Victorian culture, being considered the &quot;undoubted head of English letters&quot;, and a &quot;secular prophet&quot;. Posthumously, his reputation suffered as publications by his friend and disciple James Anthony Froude provoked controversy about Carlyle&#x27;s personal life, particularly his marriage to Jane Welsh Carlyle. His reputation further declined in the 20th century, as the onsets of World War I and World War II brought forth accusations that he was a progenitor of both Prussianism and fascism. Since the 1950s, extensive scholarship in the field of Carlyle studies has improved his standing, and he is now recognised as &quot;one of the enduring monuments of our literature who, quite simply, cannot be spared.&quot;

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Thomas Carlyle was born on 4 December 1795 to James and Margaret Aitken Carlyle in the village of Ecclefechan in Dumfriesshire in southwest Scotland. His parents were members of the Burgher secession Presbyterian church. James Carlyle was a stonemason, later a farmer, who built the Arched House wherein his son was born. His maxim was that &quot;man was created to work, not to speculate, or feel, or dream.&quot; Nicholas Carlisle, an English antiquary, traced his ancestry back to Margaret Bruce, sister of Robert the Bruce. 

As a result of his disordered upbringing, James Carlyle became deeply religious in his youth, reading many books of sermons and doctrinal arguments throughout his life. He married his first wife in 1791, distant cousin Janet, who gave birth to John Carlyle and then died. He married Margaret Aitken in 1795, a poor farmer&#x27;s daughter then working as a servant. They had nine children, of whom Thomas was the eldest. Margaret was pious and devout and hoped that Thomas would become a minister. She was close to her eldest son, being a &quot;smoking companion, counsellor and confidante&quot; in Carlyle&#x27;s early days. She suffered a manic episode when Carlyle was a teenager, in which she became &quot;elated, disinhibited, over-talkative and violent.&quot; She suffered another breakdown in 1817, which required her to be removed from her home and restrained. Carlyle always spoke highly of his parents, and his character was deeply influenced by both of them.

Carlyle&#x27;s early education came from his mother, who taught him reading (despite being barely literate), and his father, who taught him arithmetic. He first attended &quot;Tom Donaldson&#x27;s School&quot; in Ecclefechan followed by Hoddam School (), which &quot;then stood at the Kirk&quot;, located at the &quot;Cross-roads&quot; midway between Ecclefechan and Hoddam Castle. By age 7, Carlyle showed enough proficiency in English that he was advised to &quot;go into Latin&quot;, which he did with enthusiasm; however, the schoolmaster at Hoddam did not know Latin, so he was handed over to a minister that did, with whom he made a &quot;rapid &amp; sure way&quot;. He then went to Annan Academy (), where he studied rudimentary Greek, read Latin and French fluently, and learned arithmetic &quot;thoroughly well&quot;. Carlyle was severely bullied by his fellow students at Annan, until he &quot;revolted against them, and gave stroke for stroke&quot;; he remembered the first two years there as among the most miserable of his life.

=== Edinburgh, the ministry and teaching (1809–1818) ===

In November 1809 at nearly fourteen years of age, Carlyle walked one hundred miles from his home in order to attend the University of Edinburgh (), where he studied mathematics with John Leslie, science with John Playfair and moral philosophy with Thomas Brown. He gravitated to mathematics and geometry and displayed great talent in those subjects, being credited with the invention of the Carlyle circle. In the University library, he read many important works of eighteenth-century and contemporary history, philosophy, and &quot;belles-lettres&quot;. He began expressing religious scepticism around this time, asking his mother to her horror, &quot;Did God Almighty come down and make wheelbarrows in a shop?&quot; In 1813 he completed his arts curriculum and enrolled in a theology course at Divinity Hall the following academic year. This was to be the preliminary of a ministerial career.

Carlyle began teaching at Annan Academy in June 1814. He gave his first trial sermons in December 1814 and December 1815, both of which are lost. By the summer of 1815 he had taken an interest in astronomy and would study the astronomical theories of Pierre-Simon Laplace for several years. In November 1816, he began teaching at Kirkcaldy, having left Annan. There, he made friends with Edward Irving, whose ex-pupil Margaret Gordon became Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;first love&quot;. In May 1817, Carlyle abstained from enrolment in the theology course, news which his parents received with &quot;magnanimity&quot;. In the autumn of that year, he read &quot;De l&#x27;Allemagne&quot; (1813) by Germaine de Staël, which prompted him to seek a German teacher, with whom he learned the pronunciation. In Irving&#x27;s library, he read the works of David Hume and Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1776–1789); he would later recall that 

I read Gibbon, and then first clearly saw that Christianity was not true. Then came the most trying time of my life. I should either have gone mad or made an end of myself had I not fallen in with some very superior minds. 

=== Mineralogy, law and first publications (1818–1821) ===

In the summer of 1818, following an expedition with Irving through the moors of Peebles and Moffat, Carlyle made his first attempt at publishing, forwarding an article describing what he saw to the editor of an Edinburgh magazine, which was not published and is now lost. In October, Carlyle resigned from his position at Kirkcaldy, and left for Edinburgh in November. Shortly before his departure, he began to suffer from dyspepsia, which remained with him throughout his life. He enrolled in a mineralogy class from November 1818 to April 1819, attending lectures by Robert Jameson, and in January 1819 began to study German, desiring to read the mineralogical works of Abraham Gottlob Werner. In February and March, he translated a piece by Jöns Jacob Berzelius, and by September he was &quot;reading Goethe&quot;. In November he enrolled in &quot;the class of Scots law&quot;, studying under David Hume (the advocate). In December 1819 and January 1820, Carlyle made his second attempt at publishing, writing a review-article on Marc-Auguste Pictet&#x27;s review of Jean-Alfred Gautier&#x27;s &quot;Essai historique sur le problème des trois corps&quot; (1817) which went unpublished and is lost. The law classes ended in March 1820 and he did not pursue the subject any further.

In the same month, he wrote several articles for David Brewster&#x27;s &quot;Edinburgh Encyclopædia&quot; (1808–1830), which appeared in October. These were his first published writings. In May and June, Carlyle wrote a review-article on the work of Christopher Hansteen, translated a book by Friedrich Mohs, and read Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;. By the autumn, Carlyle had also learned Italian and was reading Vittorio Alfieri, Dante Alighieri and Sismondi, though German literature was still his foremost interest, having &quot;revealed&quot; to him a &quot;new Heaven and new Earth&quot;. In March 1821, he finished two more articles for Brewster&#x27;s encyclopedia, and in April he completed a review of Joanna Baillie&#x27;s &quot;Metrical Legends&quot; (1821).

In May, Carlyle was introduced to Jane Baillie Welsh by Irving in Haddington. The two began a correspondence, and Carlyle sent books to her, encouraging her intellectual pursuits; she called him &quot;my German Master&quot;.

=== &quot;Conversion&quot;: Leith Walk and Hoddam Hill (1821–1826) ===
During this time, Carlyle struggled with what he described as &quot;the dismallest Lernean Hydra of problems, spiritual, temporal, eternal&quot;. Spiritual doubt, lack of success in his endeavours, and dyspepsia were all damaging his physical and mental health, for which he found relief only in &quot;sea-bathing&quot;. In early July 1821, &quot;during those 3 weeks of total sleeplessness, in which almost&quot; his &quot;one solace was that of a daily bathe on the sands between [Leith] and Portobello&quot;, an &quot;incident&quot; occurred in Leith Walk as he &quot;went &quot;down&quot;&quot; into the water. This was the beginning of Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;Conversion&quot;, the process by which he &quot;authentically took the Devil by the nose&quot; and flung &quot;&quot;him&quot; behind me&quot;. It gave him courage in his battle against the &quot;Hydra&quot;; to his brother John, he wrote, &quot;What is there to fear, indeed?&quot;

Carlyle wrote several articles in July, August and September, and in November began a translation of Adrien Marie Legendre&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Geometry&quot;. In January 1822, Carlyle wrote &quot;Goethe&#x27;s Faust&quot; for the &quot;New Edinburgh Review&quot;, and shortly afterwards began a tutorship for the distinguished Buller family, tutoring Charles Buller and his brother Arthur William Buller until July; he would work for the family until July 1824. Carlyle completed the Legendre translation in July 1822, having prefixed his own essay &quot;On Proportion&quot;, which Augustus De Morgan later called &quot;as good a substitute for the fifth Book of Euclid as could have been given in that space&quot;. 

Carlyle&#x27;s translation of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot; (1824) and &quot;Travels&quot; (1825) and his biography of Schiller (1825) brought him a decent income, which had before then eluded him, and he garnered a modest reputation. He began corresponding with Goethe and made his first trip to London in 1824, meeting with prominent writers such as Thomas Campbell, Charles Lamb, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and gaining friendships with Anna Montagu, Bryan Waller Proctor, and Henry Crabb Robinson. He also travelled to Paris in October–November with Edward Strachey and Kitty Kirkpatrick, where he attended Georges Cuvier&#x27;s introductory lecture on comparative anatomy, gathered information on the study of medicine, introduced himself to Legendre, was introduced by Legendre to Charles Dupin, observed Laplace and several other notables while declining offers of introduction by Dupin, and heard François Magendie read a paper on the &quot;fifth pair of nerves&quot;.

In May 1825, Carlyle moved into a cottage farmhouse in Hoddam Hill near Ecclefechan, which his father had leased for him. Carlyle lived with his brother Alexander, who, &quot;with a cheap little man-servant&quot;, worked on the farm, his mother with her one maid-servant, and his two youngest sisters, Jean and Jenny. He had constant contact with the rest of his family, most of whom lived close by at Mainhill, a farm owned by his father. Jane made a successful visit in September 1825. Whilst there, Carlyle wrote &quot;German Romance&quot; (1827), a translation of German novellas by Johann Karl August Musäus, Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, Ludwig Tieck, E. T. A. Hoffmann, and Jean Paul. In Hoddam Hill, Carlyle found respite from the &quot;intolerable fret, noise and confusion&quot; that he had experienced in Edinburgh, and observed what he described as &quot;the finest and vastest prospect all round it I ever saw from any house&quot;, with &quot;all Cumberland as in amphitheatre unmatchable&quot;. Here, he completed his &quot;Conversion&quot; which began with the Leith Walk incident. He achieved &quot;a grand and &quot;ever&quot;-joyful victory&quot;, in the &quot;final chaining down, and trampling home, &#x27;for good,&#x27; home into their caves forever, of all&quot; his &quot;Spiritual Dragons&quot;. By May 1826, problems with the landlord and the agreement forced the family&#x27;s relocation to Scotsbrig, a farm near Ecclefechan. Later in life, he remembered the year at Hoddam Hill as &quot;perhaps the most triumphantly important of my life.&quot;

=== Marriage, Comely Bank and Craigenputtock (1826–1834) ===

In October 1826, Thomas and Jane Welsh were married at the Welsh family farm in Templand. Shortly after their marriage, the Carlyles moved into a modest home on Comely Bank in Edinburgh, that had been leased for them by Jane&#x27;s mother. They lived there from October 1826 to May 1828. In that time, Carlyle published &quot;German Romance&quot;, began &quot;Wotton Reinfred&quot;, an autobiographical novel which he left unfinished, and published his first article for the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, &quot;Jean Paul Friedrich Richter&quot; (1827). &quot;Richter&quot; was the first of many essays extolling the virtues of German authors, who were then little-known to English readers; &quot;State of German Literature&quot; was published in October. In Edinburgh, Carlyle made contact with several distinguished literary figures, including &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; editor Francis Jeffrey, John Wilson of &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, essayist Thomas De Quincey, and philosopher William Hamilton. In 1827 Carlyle attempted to land the Chair of Moral Philosophy at St. Andrews without success, despite support from an array of prominent intellectuals, including Goethe. He also made an unsuccessful attempt for a professorship at the University of London.

In May 1828, the Carlyles moved to Craigenputtock, the main house of Jane&#x27;s modest agricultural estate in Dumfriesshire, which they occupied until May 1834. He wrote a number of essays there which earned him money and augmented his reputation, including &quot;Life and Writings of Werner&quot;, &quot;Goethe&#x27;s Helena&quot;, &quot;Goethe&quot;, &quot;Robert Burns|Burns&quot;, &quot;The Life of Heyne&quot; (each 1828), &quot;German Playwrights&quot;, &quot;Voltaire&quot;, &quot;Novalis&quot; (each 1829), &quot;Jean Paul Friedrich Richter Again&quot; (1830), &quot;Cruthers and Jonson; or The Outskirts of Life: A True Story&quot;, &quot;Luther&#x27;s Psalm&quot;, and &quot;Schiller&quot; (each 1831). He began but did not complete a history of German literature, from which he drew material for essays &quot;The Nibelungen Lied&quot;, &quot;Early German Literature&quot; and parts of &quot;Historic Survey of German Poetry&quot; (each 1831). He published early thoughts on the philosophy of history in &quot;Thoughts on History&quot; (1830) and wrote his first pieces of social criticism, &quot;Signs of the Times&quot; (1829) and &quot;Characteristics&quot; (1831). &quot;Signs&quot; garnered the interest of Gustave d&#x27;Eichthal, a member of the Saint-Simonians, who sent Carlyle Saint-Simonian literature, including Henri de Saint-Simon&#x27;s &quot;Nouveau Christianisme&quot; (1825), which Carlyle translated and wrote an introduction for.

Most notably, he wrote &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot;. Finishing the manuscript in late July 1831, Carlyle began his search for a publisher, leaving for London in early August. He and his wife lived there for the winter at 4 (now 33) Ampton Street, Kings Cross, in a house built by Thomas Cubitt. The death of Carlyle&#x27;s father in January 1832 and his inability to attend the funeral moved him to write the first of what would become the &quot;Reminiscences&quot;, published posthumously in 1881. Carlyle had not found a publisher by the time he returned to Craigenputtock in March but he had initiated important friendships with Leigh Hunt and John Stuart Mill. That year, Carlyle wrote the essays &quot;Goethe&#x27;s Portrait&quot;, &quot;Death of Goethe&quot;, &quot;Goethe&#x27;s Works&quot;, &quot;Biography&quot;, &quot;Boswell&#x27;s Life of Johnson&quot;, and &quot;Corn-Law Rhymes&quot;. Three months after their return from a January to May 1833 stay in Edinburgh, the Carlyles were visited at Craigenputtock by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson (and other like-minded Americans) had been deeply affected by Carlyle&#x27;s essays and determined to meet him during the northern terminus of a literary pilgrimage; it was to be the start of a lifelong friendship and a famous correspondence. 1833 saw the publication of the essays &quot;Diderot&quot; and &quot;Count Cagliostro&quot;; in the latter, Carlyle introduced the idea of &quot;Captains of Industry&quot;.

=== Chelsea (1834–1845) ===
In June 1834, the Carlyles moved into 5 Cheyne Row, Chelsea, which became their home for the remainder of their respective lives. Residence in London wrought a large expansion of Carlyle&#x27;s social circle. He became acquainted with scores of leading writers, novelists, artists, radicals, men of science, Church of England clergymen, and political figures. Two of his most important friendships were with Lord and Lady Ashburton; though Carlyle&#x27;s warm affection for the latter would eventually strain his marriage, the Ashburtons helped to broaden his social horizons, giving him access to circles of intelligence, political influence, and power.

Carlyle eventually decided to publish &quot;Sartor&quot; serially in &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, with the instalments appearing between November 1833 and August 1834. Despite early recognition from Emerson, Mill and others, it was generally received poorly, if noticed at all. In 1834, Carlyle applied unsuccessfully for the astronomy professorship at the Edinburgh observatory. That autumn, he arranged for the publication of a history of the French Revolution and set about researching and writing it shortly thereafter. Having completed the first volume after five months of writing, he lent the manuscript to Mill, who had been supplying him with materials for his research. One evening in March 1835, Mill arrived at Carlyle&#x27;s door appearing &quot;unresponsive, pale, the very picture of despair&quot;. He had come to tell Carlyle that the manuscript was destroyed. It had been &quot;left out&quot;, and Mill&#x27;s housemaid took it for wastepaper, leaving only &quot;some four tattered leaves&quot;. Carlyle was sympathetic: &quot;I can be angry with no one; for they that were concerned in it have a far deeper sorrow than mine: it is purely the hand of Providence&quot;. The next day, Mill offered Carlyle , of which he would only accept £100. He began the volume anew shortly afterwards. Despite an initial struggle, he was not deterred, feeling like &quot;a runner that tho&#x27; &quot;tripped&quot; down, will not lie there, but rise and run again.&quot; By September, the volume was rewritten. That year, he wrote a eulogy for his friend, &quot;Death of Edward Irving&quot;.

In April 1836, with the intercession of Emerson, &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; was first published in book form in Boston, soon selling out its initial run of five hundred copies. Carlyle&#x27;s three-volume history of the French Revolution was completed in January 1837 and sent to the press. Contemporaneously, the essay &quot;Memoirs of Mirabeau&quot; was published, as was &quot;The Diamond Necklace&quot; in January and February, and &quot;Parliamentary History of the French Revolution&quot; in April. In need of further financial security, Carlyle began a series of lectures on German literature in May, delivered extemporaneously in Willis&#x27; Rooms. &quot;The Spectator&quot; reported that the first lecture was given &quot;to a very crowded and yet a select audience of both sexes.&quot; Carlyle recalled being &quot;wasted and fretted to a thread, my tongue ... dry as charcoal: the people were there, I was obliged to stumble in, and start. &quot;Ach Gott!&quot;&quot; Despite his inexperience as a lecturer and deficiency &quot;in the mere mechanism of oratory,&quot; reviews were positive and the series proved profitable for him.

During Carlyle&#x27;s lecture series, &quot;The French Revolution: A History&quot; was officially published. It marked his career breakthrough. At the end of the year, Carlyle reported to Karl August Varnhagen von Ense that his earlier efforts to popularise German literature were beginning to produce results, and expressed his satisfaction: &quot;&quot;Deutschland&quot; will reclaim her great Colony; we shall become more &quot;Deutsch&quot;, that is to say more &quot;English&quot;, at same time.&quot; &quot;The French Revolution&quot; fostered the republication of &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; in London in 1838 as well as a collection of his earlier writings in the form of the &quot;Critical and Miscellaneous Essays&quot;, facilitated in Boston with the aid of Emerson. Carlyle presented his second lecture series in April and June 1838 on the history of literature at the Marylebone Institution in Portman Square. &quot;The Examiner&quot; reported that at the end of the second lecture, &quot;Mr. Carlyle was heartily greeted with applause.&quot; Carlyle felt that they &quot;went on better and better, and grew at last, or threatened to grow, quite a flaming affair.&quot; He published two essays in 1838, &quot;Sir Walter Scott&quot;, being a review of John Gibson Lockhart&#x27;s biography, and &quot;Varnhagen von Ense&#x27;s Memoirs&quot;. In April 1839, Carlyle published &quot;Petition on the Copyright Bill&quot;. A third series of lectures was given in May on the revolutions of modern Europe, which the &quot;Examiner&quot; reviewed positively, noting after the third lecture that &quot;Mr. Carlyle&#x27;s audiences appear to increase in number every time.&quot; Carlyle wrote to his mother that the lectures were met &quot;with very kind acceptance from people more distinguished than ever; yet still with a feeling that I was far from the &quot;right&quot; lecturing point yet.&quot; In July, he published &quot;On the Sinking of the Vengeur&quot; and in December he published &quot;Chartism&quot;, a pamphlet in which he addressed the movement of the same name and raised the Condition-of-England question.

In May 1840, Carlyle gave his fourth and final set of lectures, which were published in 1841 as &quot;On Heroes, Hero-Worship, &amp; the Heroic in History.&quot; Carlyle wrote to his brother John afterwards, &quot;The Lecturing business went of [&quot;sic&quot;] with sufficient &quot;éclat;&quot; the Course was generally judged, and I rather join therein myself, to be the bad &quot;best&quot; I have yet given.&quot; In the 1840 edition of the &quot;Essays&quot;, Carlyle published &quot;Fractions&quot;, a collection of poems written from 1823 to 1833. Later that year, he declined a proposal for a professorship of history at Edinburgh. Carlyle was the principal founder of the London Library in 1841. He had become frustrated by the facilities available at the British Museum Library, where he was often unable to find a seat (obliging him to perch on ladders), where he complained that the enforced close confinement with his fellow readers gave him a &quot;museum headache&quot;, where the books were unavailable for loan, and where he found the library&#x27;s collections of pamphlets and other material relating to the French Revolution and English Civil Wars inadequately catalogued. In particular, he developed an antipathy to the Keeper of Printed Books, Anthony Panizzi (despite the fact that Panizzi had allowed him many privileges not granted to other readers), and criticised him in a footnote to an article published in the &quot;Westminster Review&quot; as the &quot;respectable Sub-Librarian&quot;. Carlyle&#x27;s eventual solution, with the support of a number of influential friends, was to call for the establishment of a private subscription library from which books could be borrowed.

Carlyle had chosen Oliver Cromwell as the subject for a book in 1840 and struggled to find what form it would take. In the interim, he wrote &quot;Past and Present&quot; (1843) and the articles &quot;Baillie the Covenanter&quot; (1841), &quot;Dr. Francia&quot; (1843), and &quot;An Election to the Long Parliament&quot; (1844). Carlyle declined an offer for professorship from St. Andrews in 1844. The first edition of &quot;Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Letters and Speeches: with Elucidations&quot; was published in 1845; it was a popular success and did much to revise Cromwell&#x27;s standing in Britain.

=== Journeys to Ireland and Germany (1846–1865) ===

Carlyle visited Ireland in 1846 with Charles Gavan Duffy as a companion and guide, and wrote a series of brief articles on the Irish question in 1848. These were &quot;Ireland and the British Chief Governor&quot;, &quot;Irish Regiments (of the New Æra)&quot;, and &quot;The Repeal of the Union&quot;, each of which offered solutions to Ireland&#x27;s problems and argued to preserve England&#x27;s connection with Ireland. Carlyle wrote an article titled &quot;Ireland and Sir Robert Peel&quot; (signed &quot;C.&quot;) published in April 1849 in &quot;The Spectator&quot; in response to two speeches given by Peel wherein he made many of the same proposals which Carlyle had earlier suggested; he called the speeches &quot;like a prophecy of better things, inexpressibly cheering.&quot; In May, he published &quot;Indian Meal&quot;, in which he advanced maize as a remedy to the Great Famine as well as the worries of &quot;disconsolate Malthusians&quot;. He visited Ireland again with Duffy later that year while recording his impressions in his letters and a series of memoranda, published as &quot;Reminiscences of My Irish Journey in 1849&quot; after his death; Duffy would publish his own memoir of their travels, &quot;Conversations with Carlyle&quot;.

Carlyle&#x27;s travels in Ireland deeply affected his views on society, as did the Revolutions of 1848. While embracing the latter as necessary in order to cleanse society of various forms of anarchy and misgovernment, he denounced their democratic undercurrent and insisted on the need for authoritarian leaders. These events inspired his next two works, &quot;Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question&quot; (1849), in which he coined the term &quot;Dismal Science&quot; to describe political economy, and &quot;Latter-Day Pamphlets&quot; (1850). The illiberal content of these works sullied Carlyle&#x27;s reputation for some progressives, while endearing him to those that shared his views. In 1851, Carlyle wrote &quot;The Life of John Sterling&quot; as a corrective to Julius Hare&#x27;s unsatisfactory 1848 biography. In late September and early October, he made his second trip to Paris, where he met Adolphe Thiers and Prosper Mérimée; his account, &quot;Excursion (Futile Enough) to Paris; Autumn 1851&quot;, was published posthumously.

In 1852, Carlyle began research on Frederick the Great, whom he had expressed interest in writing a biography of as early as 1830. He travelled to Germany that year, examining source documents and prior histories. Carlyle struggled through research and writing, telling von Ense it was &quot;the poorest, most troublesome and arduous piece of work he has ever undertaken&quot;. In 1856, the first two volumes of &quot;History of Friedrich II. of Prussia, Called Frederick the Great&quot; were sent to the press and published in 1858. During this time, he wrote &quot;The Opera&quot; (1852), &quot;Project of a National Exhibition of Scottish Portraits&quot; (1854) at the request of David Laing, and &quot;The Prinzenraub&quot; (1855). In October 1855, he finished &quot;The Guises&quot;, a history of the House of Guise and its relation to Scottish history, which was first published in 1981. Carlyle made a second expedition to Germany in 1858 to survey the topography of battlefields, which he documented in &quot;Journey to Germany, Autumn 1858&quot;, published posthumously. In May 1863, Carlyle wrote the short dialogue &quot;Ilias (Americana) in Nuce&quot; (American Iliad in a Nutshell) on the topic of the American Civil War. Upon publication in August, the &quot;Ilias&quot; drew scornful letters from David Atwood Wasson and Horace Howard Furness. In the summer of 1864, Carlyle lived at 117 Marina (built by James Burton) in St Leonards-on-Sea, in order to be nearer to his ailing wife who was in possession of caretakers there.

Carlyle planned to write four volumes but had written six by the time &quot;Frederick&quot; was finished in 1865. Before its end, Carlyle had developed a tremor in his writing hand. Upon its completion, it was received as a masterpiece. He earned a sobriquet, the &quot;Sage of Chelsea&quot;, and in the eyes of those that had rebuked his politics, it restored Carlyle to his position as a great man of letters. Carlyle was elected Lord Rector of Edinburgh University in November 1865, succeeding William Ewart Gladstone and defeating Benjamin Disraeli by a vote of 657 to 310.

=== Final years (1866–1881) ===

Carlyle travelled to Scotland to deliver his &quot;Inaugural Address at Edinburgh&quot; as Rector in April 1866. During his trip, he was accompanied by John Tyndall, Thomas Henry Huxley, and Thomas Erskine. One of those that welcomed Carlyle on his arrival was Sir David Brewster, Principal of the university and the commissioner of Carlyle&#x27;s first professional writings for the &quot;Edinburgh Encyclopædia&quot;. Carlyle was joined onstage by his fellow travellers, Brewster, Moncure D. Conway, George Harvey, Lord Neaves, and others. Carlyle spoke extemporaneously on several subjects, concluding his address with a quote from Goethe: &quot;Work, and despair not: &quot;Wir heissen euch hoffen,&quot; &#x27;We bid you be of hope!&#x27;&quot; Tyndall reported to Jane in a three-word telegram that it was &quot;A perfect triumph.&quot; The warm reception he received in his homeland of Scotland marked the climax of Carlyle&#x27;s life as a writer. While still in Scotland, Carlyle received abrupt news of Jane&#x27;s sudden death in London. Upon her death, Carlyle began to edit his wife&#x27;s letters and write reminiscences of her. He experienced feelings of guilt as he read her complaints about her illnesses, his friendship with Lady Harriet Ashburton, and his devotion to his labour, particularly on &quot;Frederick the Great&quot;. Although deep in grief, Carlyle remained active in public life.

Amidst controversy over governor John Eyre&#x27;s violent repression of the Morant Bay rebellion, Carlyle assumed leadership of the Eyre Defence and Aid Fund in 1865 and 1866. The Defence had convened in response to the anti-Eyre Jamaica Committee, led by Mill and backed by Charles Darwin, Herbert Spencer, and others. Carlyle and the Defence were supported by John Ruskin, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Charles Dickens, and Charles Kingsley. From December 1866 to March 1867, Carlyle resided at the home of Louisa Baring, Lady Ashburton in Menton, where he wrote reminiscences of Irving, Jeffrey, Robert Southey, and William Wordsworth. In August, he published &quot;Shooting Niagara: And After?&quot;, an essay in response and opposition to the Second Reform Bill. In 1868, he wrote reminiscences of John Wilson and William Hamilton, and his niece Mary Aitken Carlyle moved into 5 Cheyne Row, becoming his caretaker and assisting in the editing of Jane&#x27;s letters. In March 1869, he met with Queen Victoria, who wrote in her journal of &quot;Mr. Carlyle, the historian, a strange-looking eccentric old Scotchman, who holds forth, in a drawling melancholy voice, with a broad Scotch accent, upon Scotland and upon the utter degeneration of everything.&quot; In 1870, he was elected president of the London Library, and in November he wrote a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; in support of Germany in the Franco-Prussian War. His conversation was recorded by a number of friends and visitors in later years, most notably William Allingham, who became known as Carlyle&#x27;s Boswell.

In the spring of 1874, Carlyle accepted the &quot;Pour le Mérite für Wissenschaften und Künste&quot; from Otto von Bismarck and declined Disraeli&#x27;s offers of a state pension and the Knight Grand Cross in the Order of the Bath in the autumn. On the occasion of his eightieth birthday in 1875, he was presented with a commemorative medal crafted by Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm and an address of admiration signed by 119 of the leading writers, scientists, and public figures of the day. &quot;Early Kings of Norway&quot;, a recounting of historical material from the Icelandic sagas transcribed by Mary acting as his amanuensis, and an essay on &quot;The Portraits of John Knox&quot; (both 1875) were his last major writings to be published in his lifetime. In November 1876, he wrote a letter in the &quot;Times&quot; &quot;On the Eastern Question&quot;, entreating England not to enter the Russo-Turkish War on the side of the Turks. Another letter to the &quot;Times&quot; in May 1877 &quot;On the Crisis&quot;, urging against the rumoured wish of Disraeli&#x27;s to send a fleet to the Baltic Sea and warning not to provoke Russia and Europe at large into a war against England, marked his last public utterance. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences elected him a Foreign Honorary Member in 1878.

On 2 February 1881, Carlyle fell into a coma. For a moment he awakened, and Mary heard him speak his final words: &quot;So this is Death—well ...&quot; He thereafter lost his speech and died on the morning of 5 February. An offer of interment at Westminster Abbey, which he had anticipated, was declined by his executors in accordance with his will. He was laid to rest with his mother and father in Hoddam Kirkyard in Ecclefechan, according to old Scottish custom. His private funeral, held on 10 February, was attended by family and a few friends, including Froude, Conway, Tyndall, and William Lecky, as local residents looked on.

== Works ==
Carlyle&#x27;s corpus spans the genres of &quot;criticism, biography, history, politics, poetry, and religion.&quot; His innovative writing style, known as Carlylese, greatly influenced Victorian literature and anticipated techniques of postmodern literature.

In his philosophy, while not adhering to any formal religion, Carlyle asserted the importance of belief during an age of increasing doubt. Much of his work is concerned with the modern human spiritual condition; he was the first writer to use the expression &quot;meaning of life&quot;. In &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; and in his early &quot;Miscellanies&quot;, he developed his own philosophy of religion based upon what he called &quot;Natural Supernaturalism&quot;, the idea that all things are &quot;Clothes&quot; which at once reveal and conceal the divine, that &quot;a mystic bond of brotherhood makes all men one&quot;, and that duty, work and silence are essential.

Carlyle postulated the Great Man theory, a philosophy of history which contends that history is shaped by exceptional individuals. This approach to history was first promulgated in his lectures &quot;On Heroes&quot; and given specific focus in longer studies like &quot;Cromwell&quot; and &quot;Frederick the Great&quot;. He viewed history as a &quot;Prophetic Manuscript&quot; that progresses on a cyclical basis, analogous to the phoenix and the seasons. His historiographical method emphasises the relationship between the event at hand and all those which precede and follow it, which he makes apparent through use of the present (rather than past) tense in his &quot;French Revolution&quot; and in other histories.

Raising the &quot;Condition-of-England Question&quot; to address the impact of the Industrial Revolution, Carlyle&#x27;s social and political philosophy is characterised by medievalism, advocating a &quot;Chivalry of Labour&quot; led by &quot;Captains of Industry&quot;. In works of social criticism such as &quot;Past and Present&quot; and &quot;Latter-Day Pamphlets&quot;, he attacked utilitarianism as mere atheism and egoism, criticised the political economy of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; as the &quot;Dismal Science&quot;, and rebuked &quot;big black Democracy&quot;, while championing &quot;&quot;Hero&quot;archy (Government of Heroes)&quot;.

== Character ==

James Anthony Froude recalled his first impression of Carlyle:He was then fifty-four years old; tall (about five feet eleven), thin, but at that time upright, with no signs of the later stoop. His body was angular, his face beardless, such as it is represented in Woolner&#x27;s medallion, which is by far the best likeness of him in the days of his strength. His head was extremely long, with the chin thrust forward; his neck was thin; the mouth firmly closed, the under lip slightly projecting; the hair grizzled and thick and bushy. His eyes, which grew lighter with age, were then of a deep violet, with fire burning at the bottom of them, which flashed out at the least excitement. The face was altogether most striking, most impressive in every way.He was often recognised by his wideawake hat.

Carlyle was a renowned conversationalist. Ralph Waldo Emerson described him as &quot;an immense talker, as extraordinary in his conversation as in his writing,—I think even more so.&quot; Charles Darwin considered him &quot;the most worth listening to, of any man I know.&quot; William Lecky noted his &quot;singularly musical voice&quot; which &quot;quite took away anything grotesque in the very strong Scotch accent&quot; and &quot;gave it a softening or charm&quot;. Henry Fielding Dickens recollected that he was &quot;gifted with a high sense of humour, and when he laughed he did so heartily, throwing his head back and letting himself go.&quot; Thomas Wentworth Higginson remembered his &quot;broad, honest, human laugh,&quot; one that &quot;cleared the air like thunder, and left the atmosphere sweet.&quot; Lady Eastlake called it &quot;the best laugh I ever heard&quot;.

Charles Eliot Norton wrote that Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;essential nature was solitary in its strength, its sincerity, its tenderness, its nobility. He was nearer Dante than any other man.&quot; Frederic Harrison similarly observed that &quot;Carlyle walked about London like Dante in the streets of Verona, gnawing his own heart and dreaming dreams of Inferno. To both the passers-by might have said, See! there goes the man who has seen hell&quot;. Higginson rather felt that Jean Paul&#x27;s humorous character Siebenkäs &quot;came nearer to the actual Carlyle than most of the grave portraitures yet executed&quot;, for, like Siebenkäs, Carlyle was &quot;a satirical improvisatore&quot;. Emerson saw Carlyle as &quot;not mainly a scholar,&quot; but &quot;a practical Scotchman, such as you would find in any saddler&#x27;s or iron-dealer&#x27;s shop, and then only accidentally and by a surprising addition, the admirable scholar and writer he is.&quot;

Paul Elmer More found Carlyle &quot;a figure unique, isolated, domineering—after Dr. Johnson the greatest personality in English letters, possibly even more imposing than that acknowledged dictator.&quot;

== Legacy ==

=== Influence ===
George Eliot summarised Carlyle&#x27;s impact in 1855:It is an idle question to ask whether his books will be read a century hence: if they were all burnt as the grandest of Suttees on his funeral pile, it would be only like cutting down an oak after its acorns have sown a forest. For there is hardly a superior or active mind of this generation that has not been modified by Carlyle&#x27;s writings; there has hardly been an English book written for the last ten or twelve years that would not have been different if Carlyle had not lived.Carlyle&#x27;s two most important followers were Emerson and Ruskin. In the 19th century, Emerson was often thought of as &quot;the American Carlyle&quot;, and he described himself in 1870 as &quot;Lieutenant&quot; to Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;General in Chief&quot;. Ruskin publicly acknowledged that Carlyle was the author to whom he &quot;owed more than to any other living writer&quot;, and would frequently refer to him as his &quot;master&quot;, writing after Carlyle&#x27;s death that he was &quot;throwing myself now into the mere fulfilment of Carlyle&#x27;s work&quot;.

British philosopher J. H. Muirhead wrote that in his rejection of philosophical scepticism and embrace of German idealism, Carlyle &quot;exercised an influence in England and America that no other did upon the course of philosophical thought of his time&quot;.

==== Literature ====
&quot;The most explosive impact in English literature during the nineteenth century is unquestionably Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s&quot;, writes Lionel Stevenson. &quot;From about 1840 onward, no author of prose or poetry was immune from his influence.&quot; By 1960, he had become &quot;the single most frequent topic of doctoral dissertations in the field of Victorian literature&quot;. While preparing for a study of his own, German scholar Gerhart von Schulze-Gävernitz found himself overwhelmed by the amount of material already written about Carlyle—in 1894.

Authors on whom Carlyle&#x27;s influence was particularly strong include Matthew Arnold, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Robert Browning, Arthur Hugh Clough, Dickens, Disraeli, George Eliot, Elizabeth Gaskell, Frank Harris, Kingsley, George Henry Lewes, David Masson, George Meredith, Mill, Margaret Oliphant, Luigi Pirandello, Marcel Proust, Ruskin, George Bernard Shaw, and Walt Whitman. Germaine Brée has shown the considerable impact that Carlyle had on the thought of André Gide. Carlylean influence is also seen in the writings of Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Leopoldo Alas, Marcu Beza, Jorge Luis Borges, the Brontës, Arthur Conan Doyle, Antonio Fogazzaro, E. M. Forster, Ángel Ganivet, Lafcadio Hearn, William Ernest Henley, Marietta Holley, Rudyard Kipling, Selma Lagerlöf, Herman Melville, Alfredo Panzini, Edgar Quinet, Samuel Smiles, Tokutomi Sohō, Lord Tennyson, William Makepeace Thackeray, Anthony Trollope, Miguel de Unamuno, Alexandru Vlahuță, and Vasile Voiculescu.

Carlyle&#x27;s German essays and translations as well as his own writings were pivotal to the development of the English &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;. His concept of symbols influenced French literary Symbolism. Victorian specialist Alice Chandler writes that the influence of his medievalism is &quot;found throughout the literature of the Victorian age&quot;.

Carlyle&#x27;s influence was also felt in the negative sense. Algernon Charles Swinburne, whose comments on Carlyle throughout his writings range from high praise to scathing critique, once wrote to John Morley that Carlyle was &quot;the illustrious enemy whom we all lament&quot;, reflecting a view of Carlyle as a totalizing figure to be rebelled against.

Despite the broad Modernist reaction against the Victorians, the influence of Carlyle has been traced in the writings of T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, Wyndham Lewis, and D. H. Lawrence.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; credits Carlyle with the first quotation in 547 separate entries, the 45th highest of all English authors.

==== Social and political movements ====

Politically, Carlyle&#x27;s influence spans across ideologies, from conservatism and nationalism to communism. He is acknowledged as an essential influence on Young England conservatism, Christian socialism, and the &quot;fin de siècle&quot; labour movement. His work is referenced in the writings of a diverse range of political writers, including Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, Mahatma Gandhi, and Richard Wagner. Prominent Young Ireland nationalist John Mitchel and Antebellum South secessionist George Fitzhugh were both deeply influenced by Carlyle. Jamshedji Tata, the prominent Indian industrialist and philanthropist who founded the Tata Group, India&#x27;s biggest conglomerate company was influenced by Carlyle. Many social reformers were inspired by him, including Octavia Hill, Emmeline Pankhurst, Jane Addams, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Martin Luther King Jr. More recently, figures associated with neoreaction and the alt-right have claimed Carlyle as an influence, notably Curtis Yarvin, Jonathan Bowden, and Kerry Bolton.

Scholars have been divided on whether Carlyle himself was conservative: Herbert Tingsten and Richard Reeves argue that he was, while Simon Heffer claims that he was not.

==== Art ====

Carlyle&#x27;s medievalist critique of industrial practice and political economy was an early utterance of what would become the spirit of both the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the Arts and Crafts movement, and several leading members recognised his importance. John William Mackail, friend and official biographer of William Morris, wrote, that in the years of Morris and Edward Burne-Jones attendance at Oxford, &quot;Past and Present&quot; stood as &quot;inspired and absolute truth.&quot; Morris read a letter from Carlyle at the first public meeting of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. Fiona MacCarthy, a recent biographer, affirmed that Morris was &quot;deeply and lastingly&quot; indebted to Carlyle. William Holman Hunt considered Carlyle to be a mentor of his. He used Carlyle as one of the models for the head of Christ in &quot;The Light of the World&quot; and showed great concern for Carlyle&#x27;s portrayal in Ford Madox Brown&#x27;s painting &quot;Work&quot; (1865). Carlyle helped Thomas Woolner to find work early in his career and throughout, and the sculptor would become &quot;a kind of surrogate son&quot; to the Carlyles, referring to Carlyle as &quot;the dear old philosopher&quot;. Phoebe Anna Traquair depicted Carlyle, one of her favourite writers, in murals painted for the Royal Hospital for Sick Children and St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Edinburgh. According to Marylu Hill, the Roycrofters were &quot;very influenced by Carlyle&#x27;s words about work and the necessity of work&quot;, with his name appearing frequently in their writings, which are held at Villanova University.

Thackeray wrote that Carlyle had done more than any other to give &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake ... its independence.&quot; Roberts explains that Carlyle &quot;did much to set the stage for the Aesthetic Movement&quot; through both his German and original writings, noting that he even popularised (if not introduced) the term &quot;Æesthetics&quot; into the English language, leading her to declare him as &quot;the apostle of aesthetics in England, 1825–27.&quot; Carlyle&#x27;s rhetorical style and his views on art also provided a foundation for aestheticism, particularly that of Walter Pater, Wilde, and W. B. Yeats.

== Controversies ==

=== Froude controversy ===
Carlyle had entrusted his papers to the care of James Anthony Froude after his death but was unclear about the permissions granted to him. Froude edited and published the &quot;Reminiscences&quot; in 1881, which sparked controversy due to Froude&#x27;s failure to excise comments that might offend living persons, as was common practice at the time. The book damaged Carlyle&#x27;s reputation, as did the following &quot;Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle&quot; and the four-volume biography of life as written by Froude. The image that Froude presented of Carlyle and his marriage was highly negative, prompting new editions of the &quot;Reminiscences&quot; and the letters by Charles Eliot Norton and Alexander Carlyle (husband of Carlyle&#x27;s niece), who argued that, among other things, Froude had mishandled the materials entrusted to him in a deliberate and dishonest manner. This argument overshadowed Carlyle&#x27;s work for decades. Owen Dudley Edwards remarked that by the turn of the century, &quot;Carlyle was known more than read&quot;. As Campbell describes:The effect of Froude’s work in the years following Carlyle’s death was extraordinary. Almost overnight, it seemed, Carlyle plunged from his position as Sage of Chelsea and Grand Old Victorian to the object of puzzled dislike, or even of revulsion.

=== Racism and antisemitism ===
Fielding writes that Carlyle &quot;was often ready to play up to being a caricature of prejudice&quot;. Targets for his ire included the French, the Irish, Slavs, Turks, Americans, Catholics, and, most explicitly, blacks and Jews. According to Duffy, when he charged Carlyle with having &quot;taught [John] Mitchel to oppose the liberation of the negroes and the emancipation of the Jews&quot;, Carlyle replied:Mitchel ... would be found to be right in the end; the black man could not be emancipated from the laws of nature, which had pronounced a very decided decree on the question, and neither could the Jew.In his biography of Carlyle, Fred Kaplan suggests that Carlyle &quot;resembled most of his contemporaries&quot; in his beliefs about Jews, identifying them with capitalist materialism and outmoded religious orthodoxy. Throughout the late 1840s, Carlyle privately pondered the need for England to make an &quot;Exodus from Houndsditch&quot;, and to discard &quot;Hebrew Old-Clothes&quot; in religion. In June 1861, Charles Dickens reported to William Macready that &quot;Carlyle has greatly intensified his aversion to Jews, and is greatly enraged by beholding the gradual rise of a Mansion that Rothschild is building next the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s.&quot; Dickens recounted Carlyle&#x27;s vision of Queen Victoria summoning Rothschild before her and threatening to pull the teeth out of his &quot;Mosaic head&quot; unless he repaid his &quot;millions of ill gotten Money&quot;. Carlyle had once considered writing a book called &quot;Exodus from Houndsditch&quot;, &quot;a pealing off of fetid &quot;Jewhood&quot; in every sense from myself and my poor bewildered brethren&quot;. Froude described Carlyle&#x27;s aversion to the Jews as &quot;Teutonic&quot;. He felt they had contributed nothing to the &quot;wealth&quot; of mankind, contrasting &quot;the Jews with their morbid imaginations and foolish sheepskin Targums&quot; with &quot;The Norse with their steel swords guided by fresh valiant hearts and clear veracious understanding&quot;. Carlyle refused an invitation by Baron Rothschild in 1848 to support a Bill in Parliament to allow voting rights for Jews in the United Kingdom, asking Richard Monckton Milnes in a correspondence how a Jew could &quot;try to be Senator, or even Citizen, of any Country, except his own wretched Palestine,&quot; and expressed his hope that they would &quot;arrive&quot; in Palestine &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.

Carlyle argued that slavery was preferable to &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism. Henry Crabb Robinson heard Carlyle at dinner in 1837 speak approvingly of slavery. &quot;It is a natural aristocracy, that of &quot;colour&quot;, and quite right that the stronger and better race should have dominion!&quot; The 1853 pamphlet &quot;Occasional Discourse on the Nigger Question&quot; expressed concern for the excesses of the practice, considering &quot;How to abolish the abuses of slavery, and save the precious thing in it.&quot; Carlyle&#x27;s defences of slavery contributed to his enduring popularity among pro-slavery figures of the antebellum South. But liberals in Britain and the American North disputed such arguments, and among the objectors was the abolitionist Mill, in the anonymous essay &quot;The Negro Question&quot;.

In the modern era, the London Library has removed its bust of Carlyle from public display, and states that &quot;Carlyle&#x27;s racist views are completely unacceptable and the London Library does not share them.&quot;

=== Prussianist and Nazi appropriation ===
From Goethe&#x27;s recognition of Carlyle as &quot;a moral force of great importance&quot; in 1827 to the celebration of his centennial as though he were a national hero in 1895, Carlyle had long enjoyed a high reputation in Germany. Passages from &quot;Frederick&quot; were even part of the curriculum in German schools. Carlyle&#x27;s support of Bismarck and the Silesian Wars led to suspicion during the Great War that he would have supported the German Empire and its leaders (such as Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg and Gottlieb von Jagow). Allied nations largely regarded Carlyle as a Prussianist, the &quot;spiritual brother of Clausewitz and Treitschke.&quot; Prussian statesmen had identified Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;gospel of force&quot; with their doctrine of &quot;Weltmacht oder Untergang&quot; (World Power or Downfall) in order to &quot;make their own side respectable.&quot; Herbert L. Stewart defended Carlyle&#x27;s memory by arguing that besides a shared opposition to democracy, his belief that &quot;Right makes Might&quot; is &quot;far removed&quot; from &quot;the ethic of militarism&quot;, and his &quot;Puritan Theodicy&quot; has nothing to do with the &quot;Immoralism of German &quot;Kriegsherren&quot;&quot; (Warlords).

With the rise of Adolf Hitler, many agreed with the assessment of K. O. Schmidt in 1933, who came to see Carlyle as &quot;den ersten englischen Nationalsozialisten&quot; (the first English National Socialist). William Joyce (founder of the National Socialist League and the Carlyle Club, a cultural arm of the NSL named for Carlyle) wrote of how &quot;Germany has repaid him for his scholarship on her behalf by honouring his philosophy when it is scorned in Britain.&quot; German academics viewed him as having been immersed in and an outgrowth of German culture, just as National Socialism was. They proposed that &quot;Heroes and Hero-Worship&quot; justified the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; (Leadership principle). Theodor Jost wrote in 1935: &quot;Carlyle established, in fact, the mission of the Führer historically and philosophically. He fights, himself a Führer, vigorously against the masses, he ... becomes a pathfinder for new thoughts and forms.&quot; Parallels were also drawn between Carlyle&#x27;s critique of Victorian England in &quot;Latter-Day Pamphlets&quot; and Nazi opposition to the Weimar Republic.

Some believed that Carlyle was German by blood. Echoing Paul Hensel&#x27;s earlier claim in 1901 that Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;Volkscharakter&quot; (Folk character) had preserved &quot;the peculiarity of the Low German tribe&quot;, Egon Friedell, an anti-Nazi and Jewish Austrian, explained in 1935 that Carlyle&#x27;s affinity with Germany stemmed from his being &quot;a Scotsman of the lowlands, where the Celtic imprint is far more marginal than it is with the High Scottish and the Low German element is even stronger than it is in England.&quot; Others regarded him, if not ethnically German, as a &quot;Geist von unserem Geist&quot; (Spirit from our Spirit), as Karl Richter wrote in 1937: &quot;Carlyle&#x27;s ethos is the ethos of the Nordic soul par excellence.&quot;

In 1945, Joseph Goebbels frequently sought consolation from Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;History of&quot; &quot;Frederick the Great&quot;. Goebbels read passages from the book to Hitler during his last days in the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;. While some Germans were eager to claim Carlyle for the Reich, others were more aware of incompatibilities. In 1936, Theodor Deimel argued that because of the &quot;profound difference&quot; between Carlyle&#x27;s philosophical foundation of &quot;a personally shaped religious idea&quot; and the &quot;Völkisch&quot; foundation of National Socialism, the designation of Carlyle as the &quot;first National Socialist&quot; is &quot;mistaken&quot;. Ernst Cassirer rejected the notion of Carlyle as proto-fascist in &quot;The Myth of the State&quot; (1946), emphasizing the moral underpinning of his thought. G. B. Tennyson has also commented that Carlyle&#x27;s anti-modernist and anti-egoist stances disqualify him from association with 20th-century totalitarianism.

==History==

Sibley was created by Eddie and Edythe Hagglund beginning in 1954, when they observed the popularity of the nearby Lake Ashtabula and decided that a hamburger restaurant would be profitable. Therefore, they purchased some land near the lake and began to erect buildings: a dance hall, the restaurant, and many others. The city was incorporated after a dispute with authorities of Sibley Trail Township: although the Hagglunds wanted a liquor license, the township authorities would not grant one, so the Hagglunds incorporated the city. It was named after Henry Hastings Sibley, a general and the first Governor of Minnesota.

In the 1970s, the Hagglunds sold the majority of the city to others, keeping the core businesses. They retained the business core of the city for many years, even after Eddie&#x27;s death, but in 2007, Edythe announced the upcoming sale of the remaining parts of the city at auction.
