<text>Täby Municipality (&quot;Täby kommun&quot;) is a municipality north of Stockholm in Stockholm County in east central Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Täby. Täby Municipality can be characterized as a suburb of Stockholm.

The municipality is one of few in Sweden which has approximately the same size as the original entity created out of Täby parish, when the first local government acts came into force in 1863. It has not been amalgamated with other units, but minor changes of its limits have been carried out.

==Localities==
For statistical purposes the municipality is divided into two non-administrative urban areas (tätort). The southern built-up area constituted until 2014 the multimunicipal urban area Täby which was partly situated in Danderyd Municipality. From 2015 it is considered part of Stockholm urban area

The northern built-up area, (Täby kyrkby) is part of the bimunicipal Vallentuna urban area, of which the main part constitutes the seat of Vallentuna Municipality.

The southern part is Ella Gård or in English &quot;Ella&#x27;s Farm&quot;, which was the location of one of the largest farms at Täby during the 19th century.

==Public transportation==
The municipality is served by the Stockholm public transport system through SL. There are twelve stops on all the three branches of the narrow gauge Roslagsbanan suburban railway. There is also bus connection with the Stockholm metro as well as an extensive internal bus network.

==History==

During the first millennium, Täby was part of the lands of the Svear, known as Svitjod. Remains from this period can be found in more than 37 runestones found in the municipality. In the north of the municipality can be found, the remains of the 11th-century causeway known as &quot;Jarlabankes bro&quot;. The cross on Täby&#x27;s coat of arms is found on the Risbylestenen, a runestone, in the northern part of the municipality. It is said that this runestone shows the first signs of Christianity reaching this part of Europe. During the Middle Ages, Täby was part of the Attundaland region.
Täby remained a rural community until the 19th century. Most of the land was owned by the noble families. During the 16th and 17th centuries, most of the land in eastern Täby was owned by the Brahe family of Rydboholm Manor (&quot;Rydboholms slott&quot;). Other noble families owning land in Täby at different times during this period were Banér, Bååth, Roos, Sparre, Gyllenstierna and Meijerfeldt.

The latter two owned, at different times, Näsby Manor (&quot;Näsby Slott&quot;) in the southeast of the municipality. By 1790 Täby had a population of approximately 900 people, most of them living on one of the 36 farms. By the end of the 19th century the population had grown to approximately 1,250.
In 1885, the Roslagsbanan narrow-gauge railway was built, connecting Täby with the city of Stockholm. Täby experienced a population expansion. People settled near the railway stations. In 1902 the wealthy engineer Carl Robert Lamm (1856–1938), acquired the burned down Näsby Manor and rebuilt it.

Around the time of the First World War many city dwellers in Stockholm acquired small summer residences in the eastern part of Täby, what is now the district of Näsbypark. By 1919 Täby&#x27;s population had grown to 3,000. Some years after Second World War Täby increasingly became a suburb of Stockholm, and by 1947 the population had increased to 8,584, concentrated in the southern and eastern parts of the municipality.

In 1948 Täby acquired the title of a &quot;merchant town&quot; (), valid until the reform of 1971. This was also the beginning of the large scale development of Täby, led by the mayor Gustaf Berg. By 1975 the population had increased to 41,307 people.

Today, Täby is considered an attractive suburb to Stockholm with one of the highest median incomes in Sweden.

==Politics==
Täby has for a long period of time been run by a coalition of centre-right parties. Filippa Reinfeldt, ex-wife of Fredrik Reinfeldt (the former Swedish Prime Minister and former leader of the Moderate Party), had been mayor of Täby for a long time, until Jan Rosenberg, of the Moderate Party, became the current mayor of Täby Municipality.

The slogan of the municipality is today in translation &quot;Täby, the city on the countryside&quot;.

==Sights==

*Runestones: There are 37 identified runestones in Täby. Their inscriptions have provided many interesting and useful insights into the life and destinies of the people of the Viking Age. Judging from the inscriptions of the runestones and legends, the most important man at that time was Jarlabanke Ingefastsson (ca. 1000). He has given name to the remains of the Viking era causeway known as Jarlabankes bro.
*Näsby Manor: Originally built in the 1660s and designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Elder, Näsby Manor is located in the picturesque and natural setting of Näsbyviken shore. The manor was burned to the ground in 1897, but was rebuilt according to the original design on the initiative of Carl Robert and Dora Lamm who moved into the manor in 1905. Parts of the old manor garden still exist and are being well preserved.
*Taby Racecourse: Sweden&#x27;s largest horse racing track, inaugurated in 1960.
*Täby Church: Built in the 13th century. It houses a triptych from the 15th century. The most notable objects are the wall paintings from the medieval times, painted by Albertus Pictor. One of them, &quot;Death playing chess&quot;, portrays a man playing chess with the Grim Reaper and was the inspiration for the movie director Ingmar Bergman when he made the perhaps best known Swedish movie ever, &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;.
*Täby Centrum: One of Sweden&#x27;s largest shopping malls.

<text>Upplands-Bro Municipality (&quot;Upplands-Bro kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Kungsängen.

The municipality was formed in 1952 through the amalgamation of five rural municipalities in Uppsala County. In 1971 it was transferred to Stockholm County.

== Geography ==
Situated by Lake Mälaren it is distinguished by its nature. The overwhelming majority of the population are located to one of the three towns Kungsängen (pop. 7,500), Bro (6,200) and Brunna (4,000), and most of the remaining area is taken up by countryside, a substantial part of it being agricultural.

== History ==
As apparent from its coat of arms, Upplands-Bro takes pride in its pre-historic history, and boasts some of the oldest ancient remains in Sweden. From the Iron Age, about 4,000 burial places have been found, and the remains from the Viking Age include 20 runestones. The figure in the coat of arms comes from one of these remains, a 3 cm tall bronze figure found near Kungsängen.

Every one of the six parishes also hosts a medieval church, built between 1100 and 1400.

In the 15th century, the fortress Almarestäket was built in the municipality, just east to the present location of Kungsängen. It was the seat of the Swedish archbishop until the Archbishop Gustav Trolle besieged himself there in 1517, leading to the demolition of the fortress in 1519. The ruins can still be visited.

Since 1970, the main base of the combined cavalry/infantry regiment Life Guards is located in Upplands-Bro. The regiment trains conscript companies of mechanized infantry, Royal Guards and military police. It is also the home of the Swedish Armed Forces International Centre (Swedint).

==Demographics==

===2022 by district===
This is a demographic table based on Upplands-Bro Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 31,031 residents, including 20,468 Swedish citizens of voting age. 43.9% voted for the left coalition and 54.1% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

===Population development===
===Residents with a foreign background===
On 31 December 2017 the number of people with a foreign background (persons born outside of Sweden or with two parents born outside of Sweden) was 9 646, or 34.93% of the population (27 614 on 31 December 2017). On 31 December 2002 the number of residents with a foreign background was (per the same definition) 5 002, or 23.64% of the population (21 162 on 31 December 2002). On 31 December 2017 there were 27 614 residents in Upplands-Bro, of which 7 088 people (25.67%) were born in a country other than Sweden. Divided by country in the table below - the Nordic countries as well as the 12 most common countries of birth outside of Sweden for Swedish residents have been included, with other countries of birth bundled together by continent by Statistics Sweden.

== Public transportation ==
The municipality is served by the Stockholm public transport system operated by SL. The municipal seat Kungsängen used to be the north-western terminus of the Stockholm commuter rail network, but in 2000 this line was extended to Bålsta in Uppsala County and a new station was built in Bro. A new depot for commuter trains has recently been built in the municipality. There is also a bus network.

<doc id="128319" wikidata="Q3397198" url="?curid=128319" title="Campion Hall, Oxford">
<text>Campion Hall is one of the four permanent private halls of the University of Oxford in England. A Catholic hall, it is run by the Society of Jesus and named after Edmund Campion, a martyr and fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Oxford. The hall is located on Brewer Street, between Christ Church and Pembroke College. The buildings, along with many of the fixtures and fittings, were designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, his only buildings in Oxford. The hall also houses an extensive collection of religious art spanning 600 years; the pieces were collected primarily by Fr Martin D&#x27;Arcy in the 1930s.

==History==

===Origins===
The origins of Campion Hall began on 9 September 1896 when Fr Richard Clarke, who was a former member of St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, opened a private hall called Clarke&#x27;s Hall. He was sent by his superiors from the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street, in London to St. Aloysius Church in Oxford to set up a hall for Jesuit undergraduates. He founded a small house at 40 St Giles&#x27;, Oxford, and was the first master of the hall. On 10 September 1896 the hall had its first four students. The hall allowed Jesuits to study for degrees from the University of Oxford.

The rented accommodation that was originally used was too small and 15 months later the hall was moved to Middleton Hall at 11 St Giles&#x27;, which was leased to the Society of Jesus until 1936.

===Pope&#x27;s Hall===
In 1900, Fr Clarke died suddenly at York and, with his death, the hall ceased to exist. That year the hall was reopened as Pope&#x27;s Hall under Fr O&#x27;Fallon Pope as master who continued to be master until 1915. In 1902, he purchased 14 and 15 St Giles&#x27; and, in 1903, 13 St Giles&#x27; was also bought.

===Campion Hall===
Fr O&#x27;Fallon Pope was succeeded by Fr Charles Plater and the hall again changed its name, this time to Plater&#x27;s Hall.

In 1918, the hall was granted permanent status and changed its name to Campion Hall after St Edmund Campion, an English Jesuit and martyr who had been a fellow at St John&#x27;s College. Permanent private halls (PPH) within the University of Oxford were established for the reception of students on the condition that they are not for purposes of profit. Apart from Campion Hall, the other early permanent private halls were St Benet&#x27;s Hall from 1918 and St Peter&#x27;s Hall from 1929 to 1947. Permanent private halls have the same privileges as members of colleges.

In 1921, Fr Plater died and Fr Henry Keane was appointed master, until his retirement in 1926. He was succeeded by Fr Ernest G. Vignaux, who was master until 1933. At that time, there were plans for the building of a new hall in Giles&#x27;. He was succeeded as master by Fr Martin D&#x27;Arcy until 1945.

===Moving to Brewer Street===
In 1933, when Fr. D&#x27;Arcy became Master, the lease of the St. Giles property had only three years to run, so in 1935 a project of building in St. Giles was dropped and a new home was found in Brewer Street. The properties in St. Giles&#x27;s were subsequently sold to St. John&#x27;s College.

Brewer Street, also known as &#x27;Sleying Lane&#x27; was occupied in the medieval period by brewers and butchers. There is a long history of brewing in Oxford. Several of the colleges had private breweries, one of which, Brasenose College, survived until 1889. In the 16th century, brewing and malting appeared to have been the most popular trades in the city. By 1874 there were nine breweries in Oxford and 13 brewers&#x27; agents in Oxford shipping beer in from elsewhere, Brewer Street was no exception.

At Brewer Street, Campion Hall bought two buildings, one a large and ancient lodging house, known as &#x27;Micklem Hall&#x27;, which in the past belonged to Hall&#x27;s Brewery. It was owned by a brewer named Micklem (1820–1870). The second building was a garage which had once been the stables for the horses which pulled the Oxford trams. The garage was demolished, as well as some of the rooms of Micklem Hall, with others incorporated into the new building.

The new building was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and completed in 1936. The building was opened in June 1936, by the Duke of Alba, Spanish ambassador to London, alongside Alban Goodier S.J., the former Archbishop of Bombay, and Julian Asquith, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Asquith.

The building was Grade II* listed in 1954. It is the only building in Oxford designed by Lutyens, although in 1928 he did design the fountain in Tom Quad at nearby Christ Church. The style of Lutyens&#x27;s exterior has been compared to 17th-century Cotswold architecture. The chapel has a semi-circular apse with a baldachin, and Lutyens provided chapel light fittings having red tassels like those on a cardinal&#x27;s hat.

In 1912 Lutyens had laid out New Delhi as the new capital of India. He devised an architectural Delhi Order there, with small bells hanging from the capitals of the columns, and subsequently made use of it in his design for Campion Hall, including in the columns supporting the baldachin in the chapel.

Fr. D&#x27;Arcy continued as Master of Campion Hall until 1945, when he was succeeded by Fr. Thomas Corbishley. In 2001, the Jesuit spirituality journal, &quot;The Way&quot;, began to operate from Campion Hall.

Campion Hall hosts the Jesuit academic community within University of Oxford and has an international student body, admitting graduate students in Humanities and Social Science subjects, and occasionally in other disciplines.

In 2018, the Laudato Si&#x27; Research Institute was started at Campion Hall. It has the aim of conducting and fostering inter-disciplinary research on issues relating to integral ecology.

===Lost Michelangelo===
In 2011, a painting &quot;The Crucifixion of Jesus&quot; which had been hanging in a hall of Campion Hall, was thought to have been a long-lost Michelangelo masterpiece worth £100 million. The painting was bought by Fr. Martin D&#x27;Arcy when he was Master of Campion Hall at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction in the 1930s. Some experts argue that the painting dates from towards the end of Michelangelo&#x27;s life when his eyesight was failing, so is more likely to be a painting by Marcello Venusti.

The painting was removed from its position on a wall in Campion Hall and sent to the Ashmolean Museum where it is on display.

==&quot;The Way&quot;==
&quot;The Way&quot; is a spirituality journal that publishes articles quarterly to an international readership through an editorial board on subjects relating to contemporary Christian spirituality and operates out of Campion Hall. It was founded in 1961 by its editor James Walsh. He was joined by William Yeomans, Denise Critchley-Salmonson and Philip Caraman, who also edited &quot;The Month&quot;. Originally it was located in Heythrop Park. In September 1970, it moved to Beaumont College and Michael Ivens joined the staff. In May 1972, it moved to Southwell House in West Hampstead. In 1978, it moved again, this time to Campion House in Osterley in 1978. In the early 1980s, it moved to Heythrop College&#x27;s new location in London, as part of the Institute of Spirituality there. James Walsh stood down as editor and Philip Sheldrake, David Lonsdale and later Lavinia Byrne became editors. In 1992, Jacqueline Hawkins became the editor. In 2001, it moved to Campion Hall and Philip Endean with Elizabeth Lock became editors two years later. It was relaunched and ceased publishing the annual supplement. In 2008, Philip Endean was replaced by Paul Nicholson.

==Laudato Si&#x27; Research Institute==
The Laudato Si&#x27; Research Institute was also based out of Campion Hall. It was founded in 2018 and named after the encyclical by Pope Francis. It was founded by its current director Celia Deane-Drummond to conduct multidisciplinary research on the environmental issues present in the world. Celia Deane-Drummond also edits the international journal &quot;Philosophy, Theology and the Sciences&quot;. It has links with a master&#x27;s degree programme operating out of the London Jesuit Centre on theology, ecology and ethics. It is currently working on establishing the Laudato Si&#x27; Research Network to encourage global research collaboration. On 21 February 2020, its new offices in Albion House, Oxford were opened by the Master of Campion Hall, Nicholas Austin.

<doc id="128321" wikidata="Q501526" url="?curid=128321" title="Vallentuna Municipality">
<text>Vallentuna Municipality (&quot;Vallentuna kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Vallentuna.

The current municipality was established as a result of the municipal reform of 1971. Its coat of arms depicts an eagle, a broad axe and two stars.

==Geography==
The geography is still dominated by nature and agriculture and some lakes and streams, besides the urban areas. Many houses are one family houses.

===Localities===
The seat of the municipality is in Vallentuna, which is a contiguous built-up area, partly situated in Täby Municipality. There are also smaller localities, such as Brottby, Karby, Kårsta and Lindholmen.

==Demography==
===Population development===
===Income and Education===
The population in Vallentuna Municipality has the 12th highest median income per capita in Sweden, although the share of highly educated persons, according to Statistics Sweden&#x27;s definition: persons with post-secondary education that is three years or longer, is 28.6% and slightly over the national average, 27.0%.

===2022 by district===
This is a demographic table based on Vallentuna Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 34,213 residents, including 24,580 Swedish citizens of voting age. 40.9% voted for the left coalition and 57.9% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

===Residents with a foreign background===
On 31 December 2017 the number of people with a foreign background (persons born outside of Sweden or with two parents born outside of Sweden) was 6 009, or 18.11% of the population (33 175 on 31 December 2017). On 31 December 2002 the number of residents with a foreign background was (per the same definition) 3 458, or 13.35% of the population (25 905 on 31 December 2002). On 31 December 2017 there were 33 175 residents in Vallentuna, of which 4 667 people (14.07%) were born in a country other than Sweden. Divided by country in the table below - the Nordic countries as well as the 12 most common countries of birth outside of Sweden for Swedish residents have been included, with other countries of birth bundled together by continent by Statistics Sweden.

==Present==
Vallentuna has been expanding in recent years, and is one of the municipalities of the county that grows fastest every year, with more than 2% yearly, and has now doubled since 1971. Many people settle in Vallentuna because it is close to nature, and yet allows them to commute to their work places, both in Stockholm (to where the commuter gets you in 30 minutes) and elsewhere. In total, about 9,000 people commute from Vallentuna to other municipalities, while about 2,000 people commute into Vallentuna.

==Public transportation==
The municipality is served by the Stockholm public transport system through SL. There are nine stops on the narrow gauge Roslagsbanan suburban railway as well as a bus network.

==Schools and education==
All over the central part of Vallentuna you can find schools of different sorts, there is a cultureschool (Kulturskolan) that specialises in teaching music but also drama, musical and dance. Vallentunas &quot;Högstadie skolor&quot; (aimed for kids ages 12–16) are Hjälmstaskolan, Vittra Vallentuna, Hammarbackskolan, Bällstabergsskolan and Vallentuna Friskola. There also is a Secondary School (&quot;gymnasieskola&quot;), Vallentuna Gymnasium.

== Sports ==

<text>Vaxholm Municipality (&quot;Vaxholms kommun&quot; or &quot;Vaxholms stad&quot;) is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden. The municipal slogan is &quot;Vaxholm – the capital of the archipelago&quot;, due to its central location in the archipelago. Its seat is located in the city of Vaxholm.

From 1974 to 1984 Vaxholm was united with Österåker Municipality, making up a municipality called Vaxholm, but with the seat in Åkersberga. After the &quot;divorce&quot; the new Vaxholm Municipality came out larger than it had been before the amalgamation. The municipality prefers to style itself &quot;City of Vaxholm&quot;.

==Geography==
The municipality is located within the Stockholm archipelago some north-east of the city of Stockholm. It includes the Bogesundslandet peninsula, along with 64 islands and islets. Principal islands include Edholma, Edlunda, Granholmen, Hästholmen, Kullö, Ramsö, Resarö, Rindö, Risholmen, Skarpö, Skogsön, Stegesund-Hästholmen, Tynningö, Vaxholmen and Vaxön.

The municipality includes five urban areas or localities as defined by Statistics Sweden. These are Resarö, Rindö, Skarpö, Tynningö and Vaxholm. In 2010, Kullö was also considered an urban area, but it has now been redefined as part of the Vaxholm urban area. 

Other, less formally defined, places within the municipality include Karlsudd, , and Ytterby. Ytterby is known for its geology, and for the fact that no less than eight chemical elements were first discovered there.

==Demography==

<doc id="128323" wikidata="Q493841" url="?curid=128323" title="Värmdö Municipality">
<text>Värmdö Municipality (&quot;Värmdö kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden. Its seat is in the town of Gustavsberg, with a population of 9,682 (2005), on the main island at an elevation of .

The municipality is named after the main island Värmdön, in size.

The municipality in its present form was created in 1974, when &quot;old&quot; Värmdö was amalgamated with Gustavsberg (which had been detached from it in 1902) and Djurö.

==Geography==
The municipality consists of 10,000 islands, all part of Stockholm archipelago. The larger islands are Värmdö, Ingarö, Fågelbrolandet, Djurö/Vindö, Svartsö, Möja, Granholmen, Runmarö and Nämdö. Gustavsberg is the main town, and there are also several villages and suburbs spread out such as Djurö, Stavsnäs, Mörtnäs, Hemmesta, Brunn, Strömma and Sandhamn.

==History==
The name Värmdö can be traced to 1314, but it is not clear what it means. (It is likely that it comes from the word &quot;värmd&quot;, a small hot spring in the ocean which causes holes in the ice in winter, and which there are several of in the area.) The area has however been inhabited longer than that, probably from the Stone Age wherefrom remains are found. The people lived on fishing and the hunting of seals and sea birds. As the coast climate was not suitable for traditional cereal crops, the agricultural efforts were often directed towards the cultivation of potatoes.

After the introduction of steam boat lines around 1850, wealthy people in Stockholm started to build vacation houses around the stations. When today&#x27;s main roads were built in the 1930s, only the steam boats serving islands remained, and the expansion continued. With the municipal reform in the 1970s, Värmdö was created through a merger between six small municipalities and adopted the coat of arms of Gustavsberg, with two porcelain ovens.

Värmdö is a rapidly expanding suburban area to Stockholm and also one of the most exclusive areas for vacation houses in Sweden. During the summer month, the population triples.

==Industry==
The industry of the municipality was dominated by the porcelain factory in Gustavsberg, established in the 1820s. Around the year 1900, 1,000 people were employed there, making it one of the largest working places in Sweden.

During the summer the population of the municipality triples due to the large number of tourists and vacation houses.

==Demography==
===Population development===
===2022 by district===
This is a demographic table based on Värmdö Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 46,157 residents, including 33,811 Swedish citizens of voting age. 45.5% voted for the left coalition and 53.4% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

===Residents with a foreign background===
On 31 December 2017 the number of people with a foreign background (persons born outside of Sweden or with two parents born outside of Sweden) was 7 305, or 16.81% of the population (43 444 on 31 December 2017). On 31 December 2002 the number of residents with a foreign background was (per the same definition) 4 515, or 13.82% of the population (32 664 on 31 December 2002). On 31 December 2017 there were 43 444 residents in Värmdö, of which 5 683 people (13.08%) were born in a country other than Sweden. Divided by country in the table below - the Nordic countries as well as the 12 most common countries of birth outside of Sweden for Swedish residents have been included, with other countries of birth bundled together by continent by Statistics Sweden.

==Transport==
Värmdö is more easily accessible by water than by land. The boat service Waxholmsbolaget offers routes to various islands in the Värmdö archipelago. By land, the major road is the county road 222, a motorway from Stockholm. It ends in the ferry harbour of Stavsnäs, one of the major connection points in the Stockholm archipelago.

The municipality has no rail connection, but is served by a number of bus routes operated by Storstockholms Lokaltrafik, SL. Most buses terminate in Stockholm at Slussen. In 2018, the bus terminal was moved to a temporary terminal to the east, which has a higher capacity than the old slot.

Some of the major bus lines to Värmdö include 422 from Nacka, 425, 433, 434, and 474 from Stockholm. Bus connections have improved significantly since the addition of several routes in 2005.

<text>Christ Church (, the temple or house, &quot;&quot;, of Christ, and thus sometimes known as &quot;The House&quot;) is a constituent college of the University of Oxford in England. Founded in 1546 by King Henry VIII, the college is uniquely a joint foundation of the university and the cathedral of the Oxford diocese, Christ Church Cathedral, which also serves as the college chapel and whose dean is &quot;ex officio&quot; the college head.

As of 2022, Christ Church had the largest financial endowment of any Oxford college at £770 million. As of 2022, the college had 661 students. Its grounds contain a number of architecturally significant buildings including Tom Tower (designed by Sir Christopher Wren), Tom Quad (the largest quadrangle in Oxford), and the Great Dining Hall, which was the seat of the parliament assembled by King Charles I during the English Civil War. The buildings have inspired replicas throughout the world in addition to being featured in films such as &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, helping Christ Church become the most popular Oxford college for tourists with almost half a million visitors annually&quot;.&quot;

The college&#x27;s alumni include 13 British prime ministers (the highest number of any Oxbridge college), as well as former prime ministers of Pakistan and Ceylon. Other notable alumni include King Edward VII, King William II of the Netherlands, William Penn, writers Lewis Carroll (author of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;) and W. H. Auden, philosopher John Locke, and scientist Robert Hooke. Two Nobel laureates, Martin Ryle and John Gurdon, studied at Christ Church. Albert Einstein is also associated with the college. The college has several cities and places named after it.

==History==
In 1525, at the height of his power, Thomas Wolsey, Lord Chancellor of England and Cardinal Archbishop of York, suppressed St Frideswide&#x27;s Priory in Oxford and founded Cardinal College on its lands, using funds from the dissolution of Wallingford Priory and other minor priories. He planned the establishment on a magnificent scale, but fell from grace in 1529, with the buildings only three-quarters complete, as they were to remain for 140 years.

In 1531 the college was itself suppressed, but it was refounded in 1532 as King Henry VIII&#x27;s College by Henry VIII, to whom Wolsey&#x27;s property had escheated. Then in 1546 the King, who had broken from the Church of Rome and acquired great wealth through the dissolution of the monasteries in England, refounded the college as Christ Church as part of the reorganisation of the Church of England, making the partially demolished priory church the cathedral of the recently created Diocese of Oxford.

Christ Church&#x27;s sister college in the University of Cambridge is Trinity College, Cambridge, founded the same year by Henry VIII. Since the time of Queen Elizabeth I the college has also been associated with Westminster School. The dean remains to this day an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the school&#x27;s governing body.

Major additions have been made to the buildings through the centuries, and Wolsey&#x27;s Great Quadrangle was crowned with the famous gate-tower designed by Christopher Wren. To this day, the bell in the tower, Great Tom, is rung 101 times at 9 pm measured by Oxford time, meaning at 9:05 pm GMT/BST every night, once for each of the 100 original scholars of the college, plus one more stroke added in 1664. In former times this was done at midnight, signalling the close of all college gates throughout Oxford. Since it took 20 minutes to ring the 101, the Christ Church gates, unlike those of other colleges, did not close until 12:20 am. When the ringing was moved back to 9:00 pm, Christ Church gates still remained open until 12.20, 20 minutes later than any other college. Although the clock itself now shows GMT/BST, Christ Church still follows Oxford time in the timings of services in the cathedral.

King Charles I made the Deanery his palace and held his Parliament in the Great Hall during the English Civil War. In the evening of 29 May 1645, during the second siege of Oxford, a &quot;bullet of IX lb. weight&quot; shot from the Parliamentarians&#x27; warning-piece at Marston fell against the wall of the north side of the Hall.

Several of Christ Church&#x27;s deans achieved high academic distinction, notably Owen under the Commonwealth, Aldrich and Fell in the Restoration period, Jackson and Gaisford in the early 19th century and Liddell in the high Victorian era.

For over four centuries Christ Church admitted men only; the first female students at Christ Church matriculated in 1980.

==Organisation==
Christ Church, formally titled &quot;The Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral Church of Christ in Oxford of the Foundation of King Henry the Eighth&quot;, is the only academic institution in the world which is also a cathedral, the seat (cathedra) of the Bishop of Oxford. The Visitor of Christ Church is the reigning British sovereign (currently King Charles III), and the Bishop of Oxford is unique among English bishops in not being the Visitor of his own cathedral.

The head of the college is the Dean of Christ Church. Christ Church is unique among Oxford colleges in that its Head of House, who is head of both college and cathedral, must be an Anglican cleric appointed by the Crown as dean of the cathedral church. The dean lives on site in a grand 16th-century house in the main quadrangle. The college&#x27;s activities are managed by a senior and a junior censor (formally titled the &quot;Censor Moralis Philosophiae&quot; and the &quot;Censor Naturalis Philosophiae&quot;) the former of whom is responsible for academic matters, the latter for undergraduate discipline. They are chosen from among the members of the governing body. A &quot;Censor Theologiae&quot; is also appointed to act as the dean&#x27;s deputy; this post is currently held by Ian Watson.

The form &quot;Christ Church College&quot; is considered incorrect, in part because it ignores the cathedral, an integral part of the unique dual foundation.

===Governing body===
The governing body of Christ Church consists of the dean and chapter of the cathedral, together with the &quot;Students of Christ Church&quot;, who are not junior members but rather the equivalent of the fellows of the other colleges. Until the later 19th century, the students differed from fellows in that they had no governing powers in their own college, as those resided solely with the dean and chapter. The governing body of Christ Church now has around 60 members. Serving alongside the seven members of chapter, the other members include statutory professors and associate professors with joint appointments (employed both by the University and Christ Church) as well as early-career career development fellows on fixed-term contracts. Sir John Bell and Sir Tim Berners-Lee are both members of the governing body of Christ Church.

==Buildings and grounds==

Christ Church sits in approximately 175 acres (71 hectares) of land. This includes the Christ Church Meadow (including Merton Field and Boathouse Island), which is open to the public all year round. In addition Christ Church own Aston&#x27;s Eyot (purchased from All Souls College in 1891), Christ Church recreation ground (including the site of Liddell Building), and School Field which has been leased to Magdalen College School since 1893. The meadow itself is inhabited by English Longhorn cattle. In October 1783 James Sadler made the first hot air balloon ascent in Britain from the meadow. The college gardens, quadrangles, and meadow are Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

Christ Church has a number of architecturally significant buildings. These include:
=== Influences ===

The college buildings and grounds are the setting for parts of Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, as well as a small part of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. More recently it has been used in the filming of the movies of J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series and also the film adaptation of Philip Pullman&#x27;s novel &quot;Northern Lights&quot; (the film bearing the title of the American edition of the book, &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;). Distinctive features of the college&#x27;s architecture have been used as models by a number of other academic institutions, including the NUI Galway, which reproduces Tom Quad. The University of Chicago, Cornell University, and Kneuterdijk Palace have reproductions of Christ Church&#x27;s dining hall (in the forms of Hutchinson Hall, the dining hall of Risley Residential College, and the Gothic hall of Kneuterdijk Palace, respectively). ChristChurch Cathedral in New Zealand, after which the City of Christchurch is named, is itself named after Christ Church, Oxford. Stained glass windows in the cathedral and other buildings are by the Pre-Raphaelite William Morris group with designs by Edward Burne-Jones.

=== Resident animals on grounds ===
Historically, there has been a resident tortoise for the annual Oxford tortoise races. However, since 2020, due to the pandemic, there has not been a tortoise. Recently, there have been two &quot;resident&quot; ducks, which can be seen in Tom Quad, affectionately named &quot;Tom&quot; and &quot;Peck&quot; after two of the famous quadrangles in Christ Church.

The Mercury fountain also houses carp, notably a large koi carp named George, which was a gift from the Empress of Japan. A heron may also be frequently seen visiting the pond as their hunting ground. This stopped, in September 2022, when the fishes were moved to a spacious lake home somewhere in Oxfordshire while the College perform essential maintenance on the pond.

Outside the Meadow Building in the Christ Church Meadow, there are also cows present during the day. The cows are of rare English Longhorn breed.

== Cathedral choir ==
Long associated with High Church Anglicanism, Christ Church is unique in that it has both a cathedral choir and a college choir. The cathedral choir comprises twelve adults and sixteen boys. The adults are made up of lay clerks and choral scholars, or academical clerks. The choir was all male until 2019, when they welcomed alto Elizabeth Nurse, the first female clerk of Christ Church Cathedral Choir. The boys, whose ages range from eight to thirteen, are chosen for their musical ability and attend Christ Church Cathedral School. Aside from the director, Peter Holder, there is also a sub-organist and two organ scholars. The college choir, however, is always a student-run society, and sings Evensong once a week in term time. In vacations the services are sung by the Cathedral Singers of Christ Church – a choir drawn from semi-professional singers in and around Oxford. The cathedral also hosts visiting choirs from time to time during vacations.Throughout its history, the cathedral choir has attracted many distinguished composers and organists – from its first director, John Taverner, appointed by Cardinal Wolsey in 1526, to William Walton in the twentieth century. In recent years, the choir have commissioned recorded works by contemporary composers such as John Tavener, William Mathias and Howard Goodall, also patron of Christ Church Music Society.

The choir, which broadcasts regularly, have many recordings to their credit and were the subject of a Channel 4 television documentary &quot;Howard Goodall&#x27;s Great Dates&quot; (2002). The documentary was nominated at the Montreux TV Festival in the arts programme category – and has since been seen internationally. The choir&#x27;s collaboration with Goodall has also led to their singing his TV themes for &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; and &quot;Vicar of Dibley&quot;. They appeared in &quot;Howard Goodall&#x27;s Big Bangs&quot;, broadcast in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 in March 2000. &quot;Treasures of Christ Church&quot; (2011) is an example of the choir&#x27;s recording and debuted as the highest new entry in the UK Specialist Classical chart. The disc featured on BBC Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;In Tune&quot; on 26 September 2011 and on Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Show&quot; on 27 September that year.

==Picture Gallery==

Christ Church holds one of the most important private collections of drawings in the UK, including works by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael and Michelangelo. The collection is composed of approximately 300 paintings and 2,000 drawings, a rotated selection of which are available to the public for viewing in the purpose-built Christ Church Picture Gallery. Many of the works were bequeathed by a former member of the college, General John Guise (1682/3-1765), enabling the creation of the first public art gallery in Britain.

==Coat of arms==
===College arms===
The college arms are those of Cardinal Wolsey and were granted to him by the College of Arms on 4 August 1525. They are blazoned: &quot;Sable, on a cross engrailed argent, between four leopards&#x27; faces azure a lion passant gules; on a chief or between two Cornish choughs proper a rose gules barbed vert and seeded or&quot;. The lion refers to Leo X who created Wolsey a Cardinal. The arms are depicted beneath a red cardinal&#x27;s galero with fifteen tassels on either side, and sometimes in front of two crossed croziers.

===Cathedral arms===

There are also arms in use by the cathedral, which were confirmed in a visitation of 1574. They are emblazoned: &quot;Between quarterly, 1st &amp; 4th, France modern (azure three fleurs-de-lys or), 2nd &amp; 3rd, England (gules in pale three lions passant guardant or), on a cross argent an open Bible proper edged and bound with seven clasps or, inscribed with the words and imperially crowned or.&quot;

==Graces==

The college preprandial grace reads:
The first part of the grace is read by a scholar or exhibitioner before formal hall each evening, ending with the words &quot;Per Iēsum Christum Dominum nostrum&quot; (&quot;Through Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot;) The remainder of the grace, replacing &quot;Per Iēsum Christum&quot; etc., is usually only read on special occasions.

There is also a long postprandial grace intended for use after meals, but this is rarely used. When High Table rises (by which time the Hall is largely empty), the senior member on High Table simply says &quot;Benedictō benedīcātur&quot; (&quot;Let the Blessed One be blessed&quot;, or &quot;Let a blessing be given by the Blessed One&quot;), instead of the college postprandial grace.

==Student life==
As well as rooms for accommodation, the buildings of Christ Church include the cathedral, one of the smallest in England, which also acts as the college chapel, a great hall, two libraries, two bars, and separate common rooms for dons, graduates and undergraduates. There are also gardens and a neighbouring sports ground and boat-house.

Accommodation is usually provided for all undergraduates, and for some graduates, although some accommodation is off-site. Accommodation is generally spacious with most rooms equipped with sinks and fridges. Many undergraduate rooms comprise &#x27;sets&#x27; of bedrooms and living areas. Members are generally expected to dine in hall, where there are two sittings every evening, one informal and one formal (where gowns must be worn and Latin grace is read). The college offers subsidies on the costs of accommodation and dinners for UK and ROI students from families with lower household incomes. The buttery next to the Hall serves drinks around dinner time. There is also a college bar (known as the Undercroft), as well as a Junior Common Room (JCR) and a Graduate Common Room (GCR), equivalent to the Middle Common Room (MCR) in other colleges.

There is a college lending library that supplements the university libraries (many of which are non-lending). Law students have the additional facility of the Burn Law Library, named for Edward Burn. Most undergraduate tutorials are carried out in the college, though for some specialist subjects undergraduates may be sent to tutors in other colleges.

Croquet is played in the Masters&#x27; Garden in the summer. The sports ground is mainly used for netball, cricket, tennis, rugby and football and includes Christ Church cricket ground. In recent years the Christ Church Netball Club, which competes on the inter-college level in both mixed and women&#x27;s matches, has become known as a popular and inclusive sport. Rowing and punting is carried out by the boat-house across Christ Church Meadow – the Christ Church Boat Club is traditionally strong at rowing, having been Head of the River more than all other colleges except Oriel College. The college also owns its own punts which may be borrowed by students or dons.

The college beagle pack (Christ Church and Farley Hill Beagles), which was formerly one of several undergraduate packs in Oxford, is no longer formally connected with the college or the university but continues to be staffed and followed by some Oxford undergraduates.

<text>Corpus Christi College (formally, Corpus Christi College in the University of Oxford; informally abbreviated as Corpus or CCC) is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1517, it is the 12th oldest college in Oxford.

The college, situated on Merton Street between Merton College and Christ Church, is one of the smallest in Oxford by student population, having around 250 undergraduates and 90 graduates. It is academic by Oxford standards, averaging in the top half of the university&#x27;s informal ranking system, the Norrington Table, in recent years, and coming second in 2009–10.

The college&#x27;s role in the translation of the King James Bible is historically significant. The college is also noted for the pillar sundial in the main quadrangle, known as the Pelican Sundial, which was erected in 1581. Corpus achieved notability in more recent years by winning &quot;University Challenge&quot; on 9 May 2005 and once again on 23 February 2009, although the latter win was later disqualified.

The Bishop of Winchester (currently Philip Mounstephen) is Visitor of the college &quot;ex officio&quot;.

==History==

===Foundation===
Corpus Christi College was founded by Richard Foxe, Bishop of Winchester, and an accomplished statesman. After entering the clergy, Foxe worked as a diplomat for Henry Tudor. He became a close confidant of his and, during Henry&#x27;s reign as Henry VII, Foxe was appointed Keeper of the Privy Seal and promoted up the bishoprics, eventually becoming Bishop of Winchester. Throughout this time he was involved in Oxford and Cambridge Universities: he had been Visitor of Magdalen College and of Balliol College, had amended Balliol&#x27;s statutes for a papal commission, was master of Pembroke College, Cambridge, for 12 years and had been involved in the foundation of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, as one of Lady Margaret Beaufort&#x27;s executors.

Foxe began to build from 1513. He bought a nunnery, two halls, two inns and the Bachelors&#x27; Garden of Merton College. Building was probably completed by 1520.

Foxe was assisted in his foundation by his friend Hugh Oldham, Bishop of Exeter, and Oldham&#x27;s steward, William Frost. Oldham was a patron of education and donated £4,000 and land in Chelsea towards the foundation. For this, he was styled &quot;præcipuus benefactor&quot; (principal benefactor) by Foxe, remembered in daily prayers and a scholarship was established for students from Lancashire, where Oldham was born. Frost bequeathed his estate in Mapledurwell to the college, for which he and wife were remembered in a yearly prayer and a scholarship was founded for his descendants.

Foxe was granted letters patent for the foundation by Henry VIII in 1516. The college was officially founded in 1517, when Foxe established the college statutes. These specified that the college was to contain 20 fellows, 20 students, three lecturers, two priests, two clerks and two choristers.

The library of the college was &quot;probably, when completed, the largest and best furnished library then in Europe&quot;. The scholar Erasmus noted in a letter of 1519 to the first President, John Claymond, that it was a library &quot;inter praecipua decora Britanniae&quot; (&quot;among the chief beauties of Britain&quot;), and praised it as a &quot;biblioteca trilinguis&quot; (&quot;trilingual library&quot;) containing, as it did, books in Latin, Greek and Hebrew.

Founding fellows of the College included Reginald Pole, who would become the last Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury.

===Later developments===
In its first hundred years, Corpus hosted leading divines who would lay the foundations of the Anglican Christian identity. John Jewel was Corpus&#x27; Reader of Latin, worked to defend a Protestant bent in the Church of England and the Elizabethan Religious Settlement. John Rainolds, elected president in 1598, suggested the idea of the King James Bible and contributed to its text. Richard Hooker, author of the influential &quot;Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity&quot;, was deputy professor of Hebrew.

The Spanish humanist Juan Luis Vives taught at Corpus during the 1520s while tutor to Mary Tudor, later Mary I of England. John Keble, a leader of the Oxford Movement, was an undergraduate at Corpus at the start of the 19th century, and went on to a fellowship at Oriel and to have a college named after him (Keble College, Oxford).

Having been founded nearly half a millennium earlier as a college for men only, Corpus Christi was among many of Oxford&#x27;s men&#x27;s colleges to admit its first female undergraduate students in 1979 (though women graduate students had been admitted five years earlier). Between 2015 and 2017, 0.6% of UK undergraduates admitted to Corpus were black.

==Buildings and gardens==

===Buildings===
The main buildings on the main college site are the Main Quad, the West Building, the MBI Al Jaber Auditorium, the Fellows&#x27; Building, Gentleman-Commoners&#x27; Quad and Thomas Quad.

The Main Quad was built for the college&#x27;s foundation and designed in an archetypal Oxford college style, with a tower over the main gate. The quad was constructed by distinguished builders associated with Henry VIII&#x27;s Office of Work: master mason William Vertue, master mason William East and carpenter Humphrey Coke (Warden of the Carpenter&#x27;s Company in London). The quad&#x27;s architecture later inspired that of Oglethorpe University. Although by then considered heavily antiquated, in 1625 battlements were added to make the effect more complete and akin to other colleges.

The chapel adjoins the library and is just off the Main Quad. Its location is unusual: many colleges (even small ones) had their chapel in their main quad, with some colleges placing them on the first floor to fit them in (e.g. Lincoln and Brasenose). Its lectern is one of the first bronze eagle lecterns in Oxford; it is the only pre-Reformation one and was a gift of the first president. The chapel&#x27;s altarpiece is a copy of Ruben&#x27;s Adoration of the Shepherds, a gift from the antiquarian Sir Richard Worsley.

Later buildings on the main site include the Fellows&#x27; Building of 1706–1716, the Gentlemen Commoners&#x27; Building of 1737 and the Emily Thomas Building, designed by T.H. Hughes, of 1928.

On the corner of Merton Street and Magpie Lane, lie the Jackson and Oldham buildings and Kybald Twychen, which all house students. In 1884–85, the architect T. G. Jackson had first installed a &#x27;New Building and Annexe&#x27;, replacing town houses on Magpie Lane. In 1969, this work was trimmed and modified to make space for a further new building created by Philip Powell and Hidalgo Moya using a modernist beehive design, while leaving Jackson&#x27;s Annexe substantially intact. Powell and Moya&#x27;s building uses local limestone rubble and has the architects&#x27; characteristically large windows mounted within an exposed concrete frame. Particular attention was paid to placing the design within the existing architectural context, including the plain wall of Oriel College, Merton&#x27;s Gothic chapel and Jackson&#x27;s heavily ornamented Annexe. In 2017, the New Building and Annexe were substantially renovated and renamed the Oldham and Jackson Buildings, respectively.

Corpus also owns several buildings further afield: the Liddell Building on Iffley Road (built with Christ Church in 1991), the Lampl Building on Park End Street (completed in 2014 and named after Sir Peter Lampl) and houses on Banbury Road.

===Pelican Sundial===

The Pelican Sundial is the large pillar in the centre of Corpus&#x27; main quad and dates from 1579. The sundial is named after the gold-painted Pelican on an armillary sphere at the top of the pillar. &quot;Pelican Sundial&quot; is a misnomer, as the pillar contains 27 separate sundials. Nine of the sundials are found easily: four on each face of the square frustum beneath the pelican, four beneath each coat of arms on the cuboid and one facing south on the curved pillar shaft. The remaining sundials are found on the hollows and scallops surrounding the east and west arms. The symbols surrounding the sundials are used to reckon feast days and the signs of the Zodiac. The pillar shaft is covered by three tables: one for calculating the dates of the movable and fixed feasts and the Oxford and legal terms; one being a perpetual calendar and one for finding the time by moonlight.

====History and copies====
The Pelican Sundial was designed by Charles Turnball and is sometimes called the Turnball Sundial after him. Turnball lived in Corpus for 8 years, reaching the degree of MA. He went on to publish the book &quot;A Perfect and Easie Treatise of the Use of the Coelestial Globe&quot; in 1585, but it is otherwise unknown what he went on to do.

The Pelican Sundial was not the first sundial at Corpus. Before it was erected, one had been designed for the college by Nicholas Kratzer, an astrologer and horologer for Henry VIII. Like Juan Luis Vives, he was probably one of Cardinal Wolsey&#x27;s lecturers who resided at Corpus while waiting for the completion of Cardinal College. Kratzer designed many dials, however only three can definitely be attributed to him: fixed ones for the University Church of St Mary the Virgin and Corpus and a portable one for Cardinal Wolsey. Only Wolsey&#x27;s survives; Kratzer&#x27;s Corpus dial stood in the garden until around 1706, when the gardens were remodelled for the construction of the Fellows&#x27; Building. 

The dial has required regular maintenance throughout existence. The markings were replaced many times over the centuries and, despite restorations overseen by a professor of natural sciences and a historian of science, Robert Gunther, more and more errors crept into the pillar&#x27;s tables. The dial also developed a lean. This was fixed in 1967 after it was discovered that the dial had no solid foundation and that its base was made of stone panels loosely packed with rubble. In 1976, the sundial was restored (and its tables corrected) to its state 1710 by Philip Pattenden. Since the 1710 tables were designed for the Julian calendar, they have no modern use. The sundial was most recently restored in 2016.

Two copies of the Pelican Sundial exist in America. The first, the Mather Sundial in Princeton University, was commissioned by William Mather as a goodwill gesture between the United Kingdom to the United States. The second is on the front lawn of Pomfret School in Connecticut and was donated in 1912 by the father of a graduating student.

===Gardens===

Aspects of the evolution of the college&#x27;s ornamental gardens (Grade II listed) have been documented since the late 16th century. By the turn of the 19th century, a series of strict, geometrical layouts had given way to more informal features, including a lawn in the main garden, bordered by a dense shrubbery.

In their present form, as tended by David Leake since 1979, the gardens are considered some of the university&#x27;s most unusual and exuberant. Described as &#x27;wild&#x27; gardens, the stated aim is to blend a &quot;range of wild and cultivated flowers into a vivid yet harmonious landscape.&quot; Attention to detail marks even the most intimate of spaces, such as those around the &#x27;small garden&#x27; linking the front quad to the main garden at the back of the college.

The main garden is flanked on one side by the distinctive neoclassical architecture of the Fellows&#x27; Building, which is exuberantly bordered by ornamental shrubs and perennials, overseen by climbing roses and wisteria. Across the lawn, a bank shaded by a dominant copper beech leads up to a vantage point on the old city wall (above Dead Man&#x27;s Walk), where a line of three lime trees traces the course of a terraced avenue that was originally raised in 1623. The views from here across Christ Church Meadow and into the gardens of neighbouring colleges suggest a &quot;pleasant gardening outpost.&quot;

The style of gardening is, in Leake&#x27;s words, &quot;much less formal than [in] most other colleges, but sympathetic to the atmosphere.&quot; Accordingly, the library windows in the front quad are framed by seven bamboo plants. Beekeeping echoes the founder&#x27;s wish for the college to be a hive of activity.

Use of herbicides and fertilisers is avoided even on the main lawn, which characteristically is allowed to incorporate plants that have self-seeded, in keeping with an overall wildlife-friendly approach (for example, spontaneous red valerian can provide a food plant for caterpillars of the hummingbird hawk-moth).

Examples of exotic plants that have been cultivated include &quot;Campsis radicans&quot; (trumpet vine), &quot;Dracunculus vulgaris&quot; (dragon lily), &quot;Gunnera manicata&quot; (Brazilian giant-rhubarb), &quot;Philadelphus microphyllus&quot; (littleleaf mock-orange), and &quot;Zantedeschia aethiopica&quot; (arum lily). Trees include a Wollemi pine (a species rediscovered in Australia in 1994) and quince (whose fruit is given to college fellows and friends).

The greenhouse was designed by Rick Mather, the creator of the college&#x27;s auditorium. Almost frameless, it presents itself as a display cabinet in which a variety of horticultural and other informal exhibits are watched over by a surreally attired mannequin named Madame Lulu.

==Coat of arms and other symbols==
The coat of arms marshalls three distinct coats of arms in adjacent vertical divisions, in heraldic terminology: &quot;tierced per pale&quot;, from dexter (viewer&#x27;s left) to sinister (viewer&#x27;s right):
*1: &quot;Azure, a pelican with wings endorsed vulning herself or&quot; (arms of the founder, Richard Foxe, Bishop of Winchester);
*2: &quot;Argent, thereon an escutcheon charged with the arms of the See of Winchester&quot; (i.e. &quot;Gules, two keys addorsed in bend the uppermost or the other argent a sword interposed between them in bend sinister of the third pommel and hilt of the second the escutcheon ensigned with a mitre of the last&quot;);
*3: &quot;Sable, a chevron or between three owls argent on a chief of the second as many roses gules seeded of the second barbed vert&quot; (arms of Hugh Oldham (1452–1519), Bishop of Exeter.)

The Pelican in her Piety (pecking her own breast to draw blood to feed her chicks) in the personal arms of the founder, Bishop Richard Foxe, in Christian iconography symbolises Christ, who nourished the Church with his blood, which action is remembered in the Eucharist. The name of the college founded by him is thus well suited to that iconography, &quot;Corpus Christi&quot; signifying in Latin &quot;the body of Christ&quot;.

Because of the complexity of the arms they are not suitable for use on items such as the college tie, where the pelican alone is used. The pelican also appears alone on the college flag and on top of the Pelican Sundial.

==Traditions==
The grace laid out in the founding statutes is still said before every formal dinner in hall:

&quot;Nos miseri et egentes homines pro hoc cibo, quem in alimonium corporis nostri sanctificatum es largitus, ut eo recte utamur, Tibi, Deus omnipotens, Pater caelestis, reverenter gratias agimus; simul obsecrantes, ut cibum angelorum, panem verum caelestem, Dei Verbum aeternum, Iesum Christum Dominum nostrum, nobis impertiaris, ut Eo mens nostra pascatur, et per carnem et sanguinem Eius alamur, foveamur, corroboremur.&quot;

which translates to

We wretched and needy mortals give reverent thanks to you, almighty God, heavenly Father, for this food, which you have given us to nourish our bodies, praying at the same time that you may bestow on us the food of angels, the true heavenly bread, the eternal Word of God, Jesus Christ Our Lord, that our souls may feed on him, and that through his flesh and blood we may be nourished, cherished and strengthened.

There is also a shorter grace said after dinner, which is now only used on special occasions.

The college traditionally keeps at least one tortoise as a living mascot, cared for by an elected &#x27;Tortoise Keeper&#x27;. The &#x27;Tortoise Fair&#x27;, at which the Corpus tortoise(s) are raced against tortoises belonging to other colleges and local residents, is an annual event held to raise funds for charity. As of 2013, the college tortoise was named &#x27;Foxe&#x27;, after the founder of the college. The Tortoise Fair had its 50th anniversary in 2024.

==People associated with the college==
===Notable former students and fellows===

Former students of the college include the philosopher Isaiah Berlin, the writer Vikram Seth, the columnist Camilla Long, the financial commentator Martin Wolf, former Leader of the Labour Party Ed Miliband, and former Foreign Secretary David Miliband.

===Presidents===

Helen Moore, Associate Professor and Tutor in English, was elected president on 19 October 2018 for a term of two years. Her research focuses on mediaeval and early modern literature; most recently she has researched the reception of foreign texts in English. She has been a fellow at Corpus since 1996.

Land near the town of Garner was first settled around 1751. In the 1850s, the North Carolina Railroad was built, and before the 1870s, a wood-and-water stop was established in present-day downtown Garner. The community of Garner&#x27;s Station received a post office in 1878 and was incorporated in 1883, but the community had its charter repealed in 1891.

In 1905, the charter was reinstated as the Town of Garner. The first mayor was J.B. Richardson, and the first aldermen were H.D. Rand, J.J. Bagwell, H. Bryan, M.C. Penny, and J.S. Buffaloe.

In 1912, the telephone came to Garner. The town is off of US 70, which in 1917 became the first paved highway to be built in North Carolina. An explosion and partial roof collapse of a ConAgra Foods plant on June 9, 2009, killed four and injured some 40 workers.

The Downtown Garner Historic District, Edenwood, and Meadowbrook Country Club are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Tuscarora Indians used the area around Holly Springs as a hunting ground prior to colonial settlement. This tribe fled North Carolina around 1720 to escape the influx of Europeans, and eventually became the sixth nation of the Iroquois.

The town of Holly Springs grew around freshwater springs, believed to be the original &quot;holly springs&quot;, near the intersection of what is now Avent Ferry Road and Cass Holt Road. These roads linked Raleigh to the Cape Fear River and ultimately to Fayetteville, as well as linking Hillsborough to Smithfield.

===19th century===
By 1800, the crossroads had spawned a village, including a general store built by Richard Jones, a Baptist church, and a Masonic lodge. In 1805, the Baptist minister Needham Norris built his house on land granted to his father, a Revolutionary War veteran. These buildings were soon followed by a sawmill and cotton gin. Archibald Leslie, a Scottish tailor, arrived in the community around 1817, opened a tailoring business and a store, and soon began construction of a house near the springs. This 38-room mansion, now known as the Leslie-Alford-Mims House, is located off Avent Ferry Road near Town Hall. Holly Springs Baptist Church, established in 1822, was the town&#x27;s first successful church. The Masonic Lodge #115 was formed in 1847, and in 1854 a two-story lodge building was erected. This building also served as one of the town&#x27;s first schools. Holly Springs Academy opened its doors in 1854 to prepare young men for admission to Wake Forest College. Two years later, the first floor of the lodge was used as a school for local girls. The lodge was honored with a historical-site plaque in the fall of 2006.

During the Civil War, North Carolina seceded from the Union. Captain Oscar R. Rand recruited willing men of all ages to join Governor Zebulon Baird Vance&#x27;s 26th Infantry Regiment in the Confederate States Army. On a single day at the Battle of Gettysburg, during the assault known as Pickett&#x27;s Charge, 13 of the 14 commanding officers died. Only 81 soldiers, out of a unit of 880, survived. With the men of the town gone, both schools in Holly Springs closed, and Holly Springs became a virtual ghost town. When the Union Army retreated northward, Holly Springs lay in its path. Bands of marauding robbers known as &quot;bummers&quot; raided the area farms and homesteads, taking food, supplies, silver, clothes, and anything of value.

Also during the war, for a two-week period, a segment of the Union Army encamped near Holly Springs and set up headquarters in the Leslie-Alford-Mims House. Mrs. Leslie reportedly hated the Yankees bitterly, but loved her home more, so she treated them with cool civility. This may have protected the house from destruction, the fate of many other grand southern houses. Mrs. Leslie is said to have “charmed the soldiers so that they didn&#x27;t burn the house down, but they did get the chickens.” Union troops turned the Norris-Holland house into a field hospital for Union soldiers, nursed by Mary Ann Matthews Holland.

The little community of Holly Springs had appeared to be on its way to becoming a bustling town, but the Civil War ultimately left the community economically devastated. Some families moved away. The exodus was encouraged by construction of the Chatham Railroad through the village of Apex, giving that neighboring town a link to the outside world, which Holly Springs did not have. Historian M. N. Amis described Holly Springs in 1871 as &quot;a deserted village.&quot;

The Town of Holly Springs was established in 1877.

In 1875, George Benton Alford moved his successful mercantile business from Middle Creek Township to Holly Springs, and was instrumental in beginning an economic revival in the community. A year later, he bought the Leslie house, which was the centerpiece of the village. Over the years, he made significant additions and improvements to the house until it became one of the largest mansions in Wake County, one of the few with its own ballroom.

Alford, a businessman and politician, started several businesses, including a mercantile store, a sawmill, a cotton gin, and the Holly Springs Land and Improvement Company, and eventually, the General Assembly granted the town a charter. He started a newspaper, &quot;The Cape Fear Enterprise,&quot; which he used to promote the town. He also got other prominent men in the community to join him in seeking a charter of incorporation for the Cape Fear and Northern Railroad, which became the Durham and Southern Railway. During the postwar period, several attempts were made to revive the Holly Springs Academy, but none was successful. For a time, children were taught in private homes, and eventually the first co-educational school, serving 125 students, was opened by the Masons.

===20th century===
In 1906, the town addressed the need for a larger and better-equipped facility to educate the children. Under the leadership of Raymond A. Burt, J. Carter, and the Women&#x27;s School Betterment Association, 10 acres (40,000 m2) near the springs were purchased (this was, in time, the site of the library and cultural arts center). The first bell rang for classes in 1908.

By this point, Alford was a wealthy man, and he had dreams of turning Holly Springs into an industrial town of 10,000 people. The town&#x27;s population had not increased a great deal, holding at around 300, but the business community and the schools were drawing outsiders. The flourishing village was once again struck down by war with the start of World War I. The young men went off to fight, and many others went away to work in war-related industry. In 1923, Alford died, leaving the town without an effective voice in political circles. Then came the Great Depression. The Bank of Holly Springs, established before the turn of the 20th century, failed in 1924. Holly Springs experienced difficulty during this time, although Works Progress Administration funds were used to build a school auditorium. The town missed out on the new federal road-building projects being carried out to provide employment.

World War II did what World War I had done, drawing more young people away from Holly Springs to war and/or to cities for jobs. At the close of the war, Holly Springs was faced with a stagnant population. During the early 1950s, while most Piedmont cities and towns were booming, Holly Springs remained at a standstill.

During the early 1960s, with a population stabilized at around 580, the town installed fluorescent streetlights about the same time that Highway 55 (Main Street) was widened. A general clean-up effort netted the town an award from a state appearance committee. Racially, the town became less balanced with a stronger minority population existing to the late 1980s. During this period, several black businesses were flourishing; a dry-cleaning business, barbershop, three neighborhood stores, and the local gathering place of the &quot;Packhouse&quot; built by one of the town&#x27;s prominent black citizens by the name of George Grigsby, for whom Grigsby Avenue (previously called Old Fuquay Road) was named. The town board consisted of many of its prominent black citizens, among them Burnis Lassiter, Cora Lassiter, James Norris (Holly Springs&#x27; first black mayor), John McNeil, Edison Perkins, George Kimble, and &quot;Preacher&quot; Beckwith. Later, in the 1980s other prominent black citizens joined the town council, among them Nancy Womble, Reverend Otis Byrd, and Parrish &quot;Ham&quot; Womble, who served on the council for 28 years and was also interim mayor for a year.

During this period, the town hired Dessie Mae Womble, the first black female chief of police in North Carolina. As segregation gave way to integration, the Holly Springs School for Blacks was closed, and many of its students were sent to surrounding communities to further their educations. This was the beginning of an era of busing for the community, which continued until the late 1990s, when Holly Springs Elementary School on Holly Springs Road was opened.

The town built its first sewage plant in 1987, then real growth occurred. Holly Springs, in line for the spillover from increased populations in Cary and Apex, suddenly boomed; its population increased from 900 in 1992 to an estimated 6,000 in 1998 to nearly 25,000 in 2010.

===21st century===
Holly Springs Community Library, part of the Wake County Public Library system, and a cultural-arts facility opened in early December 2006.

On July 18, 2006, pharmaceutical company Novartis announced it would be building a manufacturing facility in Holly Springs and employing about 350 to produce flu vaccines using new technologies. The manufacturing facility was built on in Holly Springs Business Park off N.C. 55 Bypass. Construction was completed in late 2008. Novartis&#x27;s investment is at least US$267 million and eventually could reach US$600 million.

Bristol-Myers Squibb expressed interest in county-owned land along N.C. 55 Bypass at the future interchange of Interstate 540. The county originally expressed a desire to allow the proposed landfill site to be used for economic development to be sold to the company, but county leaders refused to relocate a solid-waste transfer station which would be at the entrance. When the company decided not to locate on the site, the Wake County Board of Commissioners voted five to two to proceed with plans to build a landfill there.

For years, town leaders have become increasingly confident that Holly Springs is positioned to experience high growth, propelled by the economic engine of Research Triangle Park (RTP). At a distance of , Holly Springs is close to RTP.

On April 16, 2011, a large tornado touched down close to the Holly Springs town center, uprooting trees and destroying homes and buildings.

<text>Knightdale is a town in Wake County, North Carolina, United States. As of the 2020 census, Knightdale has a population of 19,435, up from 11,401 in 2010. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the town&#x27;s population to be 17,843, as of July 1, 2019. Knightdale&#x27;s population grew 10.4% from 2010 to 2013, making it the second fastest-growing community in the Research Triangle region for that time period.

Named for Henry Haywood Knight, a local Wake County landowner who donated land to found a railroad depot, the town was incorporated in 1927. By the 1960s, the economic center of town migrated from the area around the rail depot to U.S. Highway 64, which ran north of downtown Knightdale. Since 1990, the community has experienced a significant population boom, getting its own high school in 2004, and a new freeway bypass in 2006. Since 2010, several new shopping centers have sprung up along Business U.S. 64 (Knightdale Boulevard), the main thoroughfare through town. A large destination park, Knightdale Station Park, opened in 2013 just to the east of the old downtown area as part of a revitalization effort, the park was expanded in 2018 to add an amphitheater. Interstate 540 passes directly through the town before its eastern terminus at Interstate 87, while Interstate 87 (in concurrency with US 64) travels along a southern freeway bypass.

==History==
===Early history===
In 1700, the Lords Proprietor of the Carolina Colony hired John Lawson to explore the area. He began his trek near present-day Charleston, South Carolina, and according to his diary, passed through the area sometime in February 1701. He wrote about a meeting with the Tuscarora Native American tribe on the banks of the Neuse River, and with the help of an interpreter, Lawson made peace with the Tuscarora.

After receiving the report from Lawson, the King of England began to apportion these lands to willing settlers. In 1730, John Hinton settled in what would one day be called Knightdale in an area near the Neuse River, not far from where Hodge Road and Old Faison Road now intersect.

As more settlers arrived, the colonial government appointed Hinton to be the Justice of the Peace for Craven County. Eventually, Johnston County was carved out of Craven County in the 1750s and Wake County carved out of Johnston County in 1771.

When the American Revolution began, Hinton switched his allegiance to the colonials. He became a military leader and played a key role in the first battle of the American Revolution fought on North Carolina soil, the Battle of Moore&#x27;s Creek Bridge. Hinton owned seven plantations in the Knightdale area, of which three are still intact: The Oaks, Midway, and Beaver Dam.

===19th century===

After independence, the population of the area began to increase, with farmers growing products such as tobacco and cotton. Slaves were used at Midway Plantation and Beaver Dam Plantation in Knightdale. There are unmarked grave plots for slaves throughout Knightdale. Although documentation of grave sites has been lost, the burials remain a significant part of the local landscape.

During the Civil War, the Confederate and Union armies were present in the area. The Clay Hill and Midway plantations saw the greatest damage, and after the war had ended, the residents began to rebuild. During this time, nearby Raleigh experienced a population boom. As a result, local leaders redrew the map of Wake County and divided it into townships. The area that became Knightdale was located in St. Matthew&#x27;s Township, where it still is today.

For many years the Knightdale area was a crossroads served only by a post office. By the end of the 19th century, locals decided there was a need to establish a town. Henry Haywood Knight donated some of his land holdings in the area to the Norfolk and Southern Railroad Company in order to entice the company to build a railroad that would provide freight and passenger service. Although Knight did not live to see the railroad arrive in Knightdale, not long after his death in 1904, the railroad finally came to the community that would bear his name.

===20th century===
After the railroad and depot were built, the area began to develop quickly. Norfolk and Southern moved families into the community to take care of the railroad, and many of the older homes that exist today in Knightdale were built specifically for the use of railroad workers and their families. The first railroad stationmaster&#x27;s house can still be seen along the tracks on Railroad Street.
As the community continued to grow, Knightdale received its articles of official incorporation from the North Carolina Legislature on March 9, 1927, with the first mayor being Bennett L. Wall.

On February 7, 1940, a fire broke out in the center of town. The townspeople turned out to help extinguish the fire, but the fire was not brought under control until firefighters arrived from Raleigh with an adequate water supply. Several businesses and homes were destroyed and the townspeople rebuilt the historic downtown area.

After World War II, the population of Knightdale grew at a steady pace, thanks to the Baby Boom. The corner drugstore, the bank, and the barber shop located on First Avenue served as places of business, as well as places for social gatherings. Movies were often shown on the wall of the old bank building, which is located at the intersection of First Avenue and Main Street. In 1952 a municipal water system was installed.

Beginning in the 1960s the majority of new businesses in Knightdale began locating along US 64. With the addition of the Mingo Creek sewer outfall in the late 1980s, development on the south side of US 64 began. Subdivisions such as Parkside, Planter&#x27;s Walk and Mingo Creek subdivisions were built, rapidly increasing the town&#x27;s population. Between 1990 and 2000 Knightdale&#x27;s population increased from 1,700 to more than 6,000 residents, making it the seventh fastest-growing town in North Carolina.

Frankie Muniz, a popular television and film actor, grew up in Knightdale. He started his acting career performing the role of Tiny Tim in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; for three years. Nominations for his performances include the Hollywood Reporter Young Star Award and the Young Artist of Hollywood Award. He currently resides in Scottsdale, Arizona.

=== 21st century ===
In 2002, Knightdale&#x27;s first female mayor, Jeanne Milliken Bonds, was elected.

There are multiple historic sites in Knightdale that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places including:
Beaver Dam, Henry H. and Bettie S. Knight Farm, and Midway Plantation House and Outbuildings.

Three of the members are elected in one year, and the two remaining members and the mayor are elected two years later. The mayor, as the principal elected official of the town, provides leadership to the governing body and the community, and presides over board meetings.

<text>Exeter College (in full: The Rector and Scholars of Exeter College in the University of Oxford) is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England, and the fourth-oldest college of the university.

The college was founded in 1314 by two brothers from Devon, Bishop Walter Stapledon and Sir Richard Stapledon, as an institution to educate clergy, and has been located on Turl Street since 1315. At its foundation Exeter was popular with sons of the Devon gentry, though it has since become associated with a much broader range of notable alumni, including Raymond Raikes, William Morris, J. R. R. Tolkien, Richard Burton, Roger Bannister, Alan Bennett, and Philip Pullman.

== History ==

Exeter College was founded in 1314 by Walter Stapledon, Bishop of Exeter and later treasurer to Edward II, and his brother, Sir Richard Stapledon, judge and politician, as a school to educate clergy. The college initially used Hart Hall, now Hertford College, and moved to Turl Street in 1315. During its first century, it was known as &quot;Stapledon Hall&quot; and was significantly smaller, with just twelve to fourteen students. The college grew significantly from the 15th century onward, and began offering rooms to its students. The college motto is &quot;Floreat Exon.&quot;, meaning &quot;Let Exeter Flourish&quot;.

In the 16th century, donations from Sir William Petre, assumed to be an Exeter graduate, whose daughter Dorothy Wadham (1534–1618) was a co-founder with her husband Nicholas Wadham (1531–1609) of Wadham College, created the eight Petrean Fellowships, and further contributions from his son John Petre, 1st Baron Petre (1549–1613) helped to expand and transform the college.

Sir John Acland (died 1620), a Devonshire gentleman, donated £800, which largely financed the building of a new dining hall, and also established two scholarships for poor students, the first to be created at the college. In a clever move by the bursar to fill the new buildings as they were completed, a significant number of noble Roman Catholic students were invited to enrol and take classes at the enlarged college; however, they were not allowed to matriculate. As a result, over time, Exeter College became one of the leading colleges in the university.

In the 18th century the college experienced declining popularity, as did all of Oxford&#x27;s other colleges. University reforms in the 1850s helped to end this period of stagnation.

=== Women at Exeter ===
For over six centuries after its founding, women were not permitted to study at Exeter, but in 1979 it joined many other men&#x27;s colleges in admitting its first female students. Today it admits men and women in roughly equal numbers. In 1993, Exeter College became the first of the formerly all-male colleges to elect a woman, Marilyn Butler, as its rector. When Butler&#x27;s tenure expired in October 2004, the college elected another woman—Frances Cairncross, former senior editor of &quot;The Economist&quot;—as rector.

In 2014, the author J. K. Rowling was elected an honorary fellow of the college for the &quot;extraordinary contribution she has made to the field of literature, and in particular to children&#x27;s reading and literacy&quot;.

=== Adelphi Wine Club ===
Formed in the 1850s, the Adelphi Wine Club is reputed to be one of the oldest three wine clubs in Oxford. The club draws its membership from undergraduates studying at Exeter College. It has been forcibly closed down by college authorities several times throughout its tumultuous existence and is currently believed to be dormant. The club was renowned for its extravagant dinners, and for excessive gambling after each meeting. One black ball was sufficient to exclude an undergraduate from membership. Beginning in 1923, the college forbade any student holding an exhibition from joining the club.

Notable past members include Sir Martin Le Quesne, and J.P.V.D. Balsdon.

== Buildings ==
=== Front Quadrangle ===
The Front Quadrangle sits on roughly the site of the medieval college, although of the earliest buildings, only Palmer&#x27;s Tower in the north-eastern corner remains. Constructed in 1432, the tower, which was once the primary entrance to the college, now houses various offices and lodgings for fellows, and at its base is a memorial to members who were killed in the Second World War. The quadrangle is dominated by the chapel, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott and constructed in 1854–1860, which was heavily inspired by the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. On the opposite side stands the hall, constructed in 1618, notable for its vaulted ceilings and numerous fine portraits, underneath which is the college bar. Building work over the following century resulted in the quadrangle taking on its current appearance in 1710. The Front Quadrangle also houses the Junior, Middle and Senior Common Rooms, as well as lodgings for fellows and undergraduates.

=== Margary quadrangle ===
The Margary quadrangle was completed in 1964 with the construction of the Thomas Wood building to commemorate the 650th anniversary of the college and named for Ivan Margary, who paid for its restoration. The quadrangle also incorporates the rector&#x27;s lodgings, designed by Gilbert Scott and constructed in 1857, and staircases nine, ten and eleven, also erected during the 19th century.

=== Fellows&#x27; Garden ===
A passageway from the Front Quadrangle leads through to the college&#x27;s Fellows&#x27; Garden, in which stands the library, designed by Gilbert Scott in the 13th-century style. The area is also bounded on the left hand side by Convocation House, the Divinity School and the Bodleian Library, and on the right by Brasenose Lane. The Mound, situated at the end of the Garden, offers views over Radcliffe Square, including All Souls&#x27; College and the Radcliffe Camera.

=== Cohen Quad ===
In 2007–2008, the college purchased the main site of Ruskin College on Walton Street for £7 million. The buildings were redeveloped to designs by Alison Brooks Architects to provide a range of student bedrooms, teaching rooms, and study space. In 2017 Cohen Quad was formally opened, named for the parents of Sir Ronald Cohen. The premises represent the college&#x27;s largest physical expansion since the 14th century. The Cohen Quad won an RIBA South Award as well as Regional Building of the Year.

===In literature and films===
Exeter College is the basis for the fictional Jordan College in Philip Pullman&#x27;s novel trilogy &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;. The 2007 film version of the first novel, &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; (originally &quot;Northern Lights)&quot;, used the college for location filming.
The final episode of &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, based on the novel &quot;The Remorseful Day&quot;, was filmed in the college chapel and Front Quadrangle, where Morse has a heart attack.

== Student life ==
Exeter has a reputation for having a close-knit student body. First-year undergraduates are housed on the college&#x27;s Turl Street site, and there is dedicated graduate accommodation for the college on Iffley Road.

As the university&#x27;s fourth oldest college, a certain emphasis is placed on tradition, especially during special occasions such as the annual Burns Night, a dinner in honour of the Scottish poet Robert Burns, when a traditional meal of haggis is served. The college&#x27;s ties with Williams College in the United States, as well as the generally international composition of the MCR, makes the annual Thanksgiving dinner a popular occasion.

=== Choir ===
Exeter has a mixed-voice choir, made up of 24 singers, which is administered, conducted and accompanied solely by the Organ Scholars. It is the only college in either Oxford or Cambridge where a choir, run entirely by the Organ Scholar, sings three services a week, and has been heard recently on a number of broadcasts for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Service&quot;. The college offers Choral and Parry–Wood Organ Scholarships, and former Organ Scholars include Robert Sharpe (Director of Music, York Minster), Christopher Herrick (International Concert Organist and former Organist, Westminster Abbey), and David Trendell (Director of Music, King&#x27;s College London), as well as Directors of Music at Rugby, Charterhouse, Sherborne, and Latymer Upper Schools.

=== Sports ===
Sports at Exeter College are not directly organised by the college itself, but rather by student-run clubs. Exeter College own their own sports grounds, which can be used by these student clubs within University Parks. The sports that have active student run clubs as of October 2023 are: boating, netball, football, cricket, badminton, hockey, rugby, ice hockey, pool, darts, croquet, and lacrosse.

In March 2014 Exeter College Association Football Club defeated St Catherine&#x27;s College 2–1 in the final of the Cuppers tournament to lift the trophy for the first time in over 40 years. In May 2019 Turl Street Rugby, made up of students from Exeter College, Jesus College and Lincoln College, won Oxford&#x27;s inaugural 15-a-side Women&#x27;s Rugby Union Cuppers tournament.
In May 2024, Exeter College Rugby Football Club secured the Cuppers Bowl Trophy with a narrow victory, defeating a combined team from St Catherine&#x27;s, Mansfield, Corpus Christi, Somerville, and Merton Colleges by a score of 17-15.
== People associated with Exeter ==

Tolkien, Alan Bennett, Martin Amis and Philip Pullman; Roger Bannister, the first man to run a mile in under four minutes; the actors Richard Burton and Imogen Stubbs; Liaquat Ali Khan, the first prime minister of Pakistan, John Kufuor, the former President of Ghana and Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, former president of Peru.

<text>Wake Forest is a town in Wake and Franklin counties in the U.S. state of North Carolina. Located almost entirely in Wake County, it lies just north of the state capital, Raleigh. At the 2020 census, the population was 47,601, up from 30,117 in 2010. It is part of the Raleigh metropolitan area. Wake Forest was the original home of Wake Forest University for 122 years before it moved to Winston-Salem in 1956.

==History==
In 1832, Dr. Calvin Jones, originally from New England, bought of forested land in Wake County, North Carolina. He built his plantation here. The sparsely populated area became known as the Forest of Wake, or Wake Forest. Jones sold his farm to the North Carolina Baptist Convention for $2,000, who opened the Wake Forest Manual Labor Institute, later Wake Forest College, on the site. The Raleigh &amp; Gaston Railroad, completed in 1840, established a depot in nearby Forestville that stimulated the school and surrounding village. College leaders convinced the railroad to move the depot even closer to the college in 1874, leading to more economic development. This community was incorporated as the &quot;Town of Wake Forest College&quot; in 1880. In 1909, the word &quot;College&quot; was removed from the name of the town. The college moved to the much larger city of Winston-Salem in 1956. Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary began offering classes on the original campus of Wake Forest University in 1950, and occupied the entire campus when the university completed its move.

As settlement increased, a small village took form. The villagers asked the local schoolteacher, M.A. Griffin, to choose a name. Griffin suggested they call it Wendell, in honor of his favorite poet, Oliver Wendell Holmes. However, the townspeople pronounce each syllable with equal emphasis, not as the poet&#x27;s middle name is said. The Town seal was adopted on April 4, 1963.

The first post office was built in 1891, and has been restored by the Wendell Historical Society. The oldest institution in Wendell is Hephzibah Baptist Church, founded in 1809.

==History==
Norlina was first called the &quot;Ridgeway Junction&quot; in 1837. As a railroad passed through this area, many citizens started to sell wood and water to the railroad. Eventually this began to expand, and in the 1860s the name changed to the &quot;Woodyard&quot;. By the 1870s, the area had grown in business, and was referred to as the &quot;Junction&quot;. The Seaboard &amp; Raleigh Railroad had just been formed, and the &quot;Junction&quot; was now thriving with its business. A small community was formed, including two hardware stores, a horse drawn taxi service, and smithing shops. By 1900, John Williams established the Seaboard Air Line Railway and it grew to over 4,680 miles. This small group of people had turned the railway stop into a real town. In 1913 the name Norlina was coined, being a portmanteau of the beginning of &quot;North&quot; and the ending of &quot;Carolina&quot;.

==History==
The Moratuc tribe of American Indians was living in a large settlement on Welch Creek near the current Domtar pulp mill site in 1585 when the area was explored by English settlers. Moratuc was an Indian name for the Roanoke River. The Moratuc tribe were probably an Algonquian tribe, but there is debate that they may have been Iroquois.

Plymouth was established in 1787 by Arthur Rhodes on of his Brick House plantation he subdivided into 172 lots. Note that &quot;Brickhouse&quot; is a common local patronym. In 1790, the North Carolina General Assembly named Plymouth a &quot;port of delivery&quot; and in 1808 it was named a &quot;port of entry&quot;. The county seat of Washington County was moved to Plymouth from Lee&#x27;s Mill, as Roper, North Carolina, was then known, by special act of the General Assembly on January 31, 1823. A new courthouse was completed by November 1824 on the same site where the present courthouse stands. It stood until 1862 when it caught fire and burned to the ground from a shell fired by a Union gunboat during bombardment of Plymouth.

Plymouth has the historical distinction of being the site of the second-largest battle in North Carolina and its last Confederate victory, the Battle of Plymouth (1864), during the American Civil War. The Confederate ironclad warship CSS &quot;Albemarle&quot; — and its eventual sinking on October 27, 1864, while moored at a dock in Plymouth — are the centerpieces of this history.
Beginning early in the war and for its remainder, the Union controlled the Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds. The geographical importance for the Northern forces of Plymouth&#x27;s location at the mouth of the Roanoke River was the Union desire to push upriver and capture the vital Wilmington and Weldon Railroad line passing through Weldon, North Carolina, which would completely cut off the major supply line for General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s army in Virginia from more southerly ports. This would essentially end all support for Lee&#x27;s forces and force his defeat or retreat from Virginia.

Fort Branch, located upriver at Hamilton, successfully blocked the Union gunboats and troops sailing upstream from Plymouth at the river bend called Rainbow Branch. The fort held until April 10, 1865, one day after General Lee surrendered at Appomattox Courthouse, Virginia, at which point it was abandoned and its cannons were hurled into the Roanoke River. Thus, the war histories of Fort Branch and Plymouth are intimately connected.

Plymouth State Normal School was established to educate African American teachers. It was moved to Elizabeth City in 1903 and became Elizabeth City State University.

The Port O&#x27;Plymouth History Museum, located in the circa 1923 former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad station in downtown Plymouth, has an excellent, nationally recognized collection of Civil War artifacts, including one of the most complete belt-buckle and button collections in the U.S. and a model of the ironclad ram CSS &quot;Albemarle&quot;.

The Garrett&#x27;s Island House, Latham House, Perry-Spruill House, Plymouth Historic District, and Washington County Courthouse, New Chapel Missionary Baptist Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Economy==

The primary industry for the area is Domtar Paper Company, LLC., a paper manufacturer. The paper mill and its related facilities have been the largest employer since 1937. It was owned by Kieckhefer Container Company (John W. Kieckhefer) which was merged into Weyerhauser in 1957. In March 2007, Weyerhauser sold its paper interests to Domtar. The paper mill is now a Domtar papermill, while the onsite sawmill is still owned by Weyerhauser. In October 2009, Domtar announced the end of paper machine operations, and the mill will be converted to produce fluff pulp alone, with a 33% workforce reduction to about 360 employees.

The town is re-branding itself as a tourist destination to offset the reduction in paper-making employment, taking advantage of its natural environment, being surrounded by tracts of forests and swamplands. A riverfront boardwalk has been built, with views of the Roanoke River. Plymouth is home to the North Carolina Black Bear Festival, an annual three-day event at the beginning of June centered around bears.

<text>Greyfriars is a Roman Catholic friary and parish located in East Oxford, which until 2008 was also a permanent private hall of the University of Oxford. Situated on the Iffley Road in East Oxford, it was one of the smallest constituent halls of the university. Its status as a permanent private hall (PPH) derived from the fact that it was governed by an outside institution (the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, a Franciscan religious order), rather than by the fellows of the University as a constituent college is.

In 2007 the decision was made to close the hall, with students transferred to Regent&#x27;s Park College. The buildings continue to host the friary which formerly co-existed with the hall.

Greyfriars has one of the most distinctive buildings in Oxford; it is the only flint-stone Norman-style building in the city, and its green spire is prominently visible along the Iffley Road and from the university&#x27;s Roger Bannister running track.

==History==

=== Medieval friary ===

The original Greyfriars church and friary was founded by the Franciscans in 1224. The friars had a long and esteemed history in Oxford, listing many famous alumni, including the English statesman, Robert Grosseteste, also a theologian and Bishop of Lincoln, who became head of Greyfriars, Master of the School of Oxford from 1208, and the first Chancellor of the University of Oxford. In 1517, the order divided into two branches. The friars who had been living in city-convents, ministering there and teaching in universities became known as &quot;Conventuals&quot;; while the friars who preferred a more eremitical life became known as &quot;Observants&quot;. (The Capuchins developed in 1528.) The friaries were suppressed during the Reformation in the 16th century.

=== 20th century friary and hall ===

In 1905, the Capuchin branch of the order established a friary, known as St Anselm&#x27;s, which was recognised by the university as a house of studies in 1910. The Church of St Edmund and St Frideswide on Iffley Road was established in 1911 as a chapel of ease to the Jesuit church of St Aloysius. In 1928, the Jesuits handed it over to the Capuchins, who then built the friary.

In 1919, the friars moved to the current site on the Iffley Road—first naming it Grosseteste House after the first head of the original Greyfriars—and on completion of the present building in 1930, the name of Greyfriars was adopted once more. The status of permanent private hall was conferred upon Greyfriars by the university in 1957 and surrendered in 2008.

In 2007, Greyfriars celebrated 50 years of its PPH status, with considerable flourish, and an unusually high number of first-class undergraduate grades marked the year.

===Closure of the hall===
In October 2007, the order announced its intention to withdraw from its ministry as a permanent private hall of the university, for financial and personnel reasons. Given the age of the building and the reduced number of friars, the cost of maintenance, rehabilitation, and staffing would be unsustainable for the province, and negatively impact other ministries elsewhere. Arrangements were made to transfer all students and prospective applicants so interested to Regent&#x27;s Park College. The decision aroused considerable controversy; substantial proposals by the fellows for the continuation of Greyfriars were considered by the Governing Body. The university eventually indicated that the friars&#x27; licence to run Greyfriars as a PPH would not be transferred to any other body, and the hall closed in June 2008, despite a last-minute attempt to save the hall by the Holy See.

It may seem strange that the Greyfriars students did not migrate to St. Benet&#x27;s Hall (the Benedictine PPH) or Blackfriars (the Dominican PPH). However, Greyfriars had some years earlier admitted female students, and at that time neither of these other Catholic PPHs had done so. Regent&#x27;s Park welcomed the Greyfriars students warmly, and the migration is commemorated by a plaque at Regent&#x27;s Park. The latter announced in 2018 that it would be seeking donations to fund a Greyfriars Scholarship at Regent&#x27;s Park.

The Capuchin Order has stated that it will continue to exist at Greyfriars in Oxford and the premises will continue to operate as a friary; the order will maintain responsibility for the parish.

At the time of Greyfriars&#x27; closure, the Visitor was Mauro Jöhri, Minister General, the Warden was Mark Elvins, and the fellows included Aidan Nichols, John Paul II Lecturer in Roman Catholic Theology. The immediate previous Warden was Nicholas Richardson (2004-2007). Honorary Fellows included Thomas G. Weinandy (Warden 1993–2004), and Vincent Nichols, RC Archbishop of Birmingham. Among earlier Wardens who were members of the Capuchin order, the highly respected musical scholar Peter Peacock (an Oxford D.Mus. who then became Professor of Music at Loyola University New Orleans) and then Cassian Reel served for long periods with distinction.

==Friary and tuition==
Greyfriars occupied an uncommon position in Oxford, in that its University Hall and Franciscan friary were part of the same institution and coexisted on the same site—however, the friars were not usually members of the academic hall (though this was not without exception), nor were the students actually affiliated to the friary—the two groups did, however, mingle, most notably at mealtimes. (A similar system continues to operate with great success at Blackfriars, Oxford.) Furthermore, no religious restrictions were placed on applicants; and, while the hall had a tradition of noted theology academics, a wide range of disciplines were studied by students—the most common being English, history, theology, geography and law. Although the hall employed tutors specialising in certain areas of some of these subjects, students generally went to other colleges for the majority of their tutorials. The college most closely linked with Greyfriars was Balliol College, owing to a long-standing tradition of sporting links, but Greyfriars students were tutored at a wide number of the university&#x27;s colleges at some point or another.

==Student life==
While Greyfriars was small in terms of grounds and numbers, it had a close-knit community and a lively academic life. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, undergraduate numbers tended to be around the 30 mark, with an average of between nine and eleven students per year in addition to a handful of visiting and postgraduate students. From around 2003, numbers increased, and the student population of the hall when it closed numbered closer to 50.

The hall annually held a popular summer garden party, and a &quot;bop&quot; that was dubbed &#x27;The Monastery of Sound&#x27; in tongue-in-cheek acknowledgement of the friars. Greyfriars was also influential in the Oxford Law Society, the Conservative Association, the Dramatic Society, and the Indie Music Society, as well as rowing, hockey, rugby, tennis and table tennis. Its increasing prominence was very much disproportionate to student numbers, which was testament to their eagerness to get involved in university life.

As with all Oxford colleges, Greyfriars&#x27; student community was a JCR, run by an annually elected committee usually consisting of a president, secretary, treasurer and various other officers as necessary.

==Greyfriars Society==
The Greyfriars Society was established in 1999 and is the official alumni organisation of Greyfriars. The main objectives of the society are to maintain and build relationships with the Hall&#x27;s alumni and were also to raise money to enable Greyfriars to provide the best possible education for the growing student body. The first Patron was the late Cormac Murphy-O&#x27;Connor, Cardinal-Archbishop emeritus of Westminster, and the President is David Alton.

<text>Salem Municipality (&quot;Salems kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden. The name traces its origins from &quot;Slæm&quot; in the 13th century, but was changed to Salem in the 17th century, inspired by the Biblical name of Jerusalem. Its seat is located in Salem.

==History==

Like the rest of the areas around Lake Mälaren, Salem has a significant amount of ancient remains, as far back as the Stone Age. The church of Salem traces its foundation to the 12th century.

Just like its eastern municipal neighbour Botkyrka, Salem traces its history back to the legendary Saint Botvid, who lived in the area sometime between 1050-1120. In the medieval tradition, a spring would always be found in connection to the death of a saint. According to legend, when the remains of Saint Botvid were transported to the church in today&#x27;s Botkyrka, the casket was temporarily put down near the shore of Lake Bornsjön, where a spring poured up. It continues to provide clear water to this day.

==Today==
Salem was united with the municipality of Botkyrka during the Swedish municipal reform between 1971-1974. However, in 1983, after energetic protests, they were split apart, and Salem became the 14th smallest municipality by area in the country. 

Salem is served by one station, Rönninge, on the commuter train line between Södertälje and Märsta via Stockholm. There are also a good network of bus lines.

The number of people in Salem is about 30% less during day time due to that it has the biggest percentage of people in Stockholm county that work outside own municipal.

==Demography==
===Population development===
===2022 population by district===
This is a demographic table based on Salem Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

Residents include everyone registered as living in the district, regardless of age or citizenship status. Valid voters indicate Swedish citizens above the age of 18 who therefore can vote in general elections. Left vote and right vote indicate the result between the two major blocs in said district in the 2022 general election. Employment indicates the share of people between the ages of 20 and 64 who are working taxpayers. Foreign background is defined as residents either born abroad or with two parents born outside of Sweden. Median income is the received monthly income through either employment, capital gains or social grants for the median adult above 20, also including pensioners in Swedish kronor. The section about college graduates indicates any degree accumulated after high school.

In total there were 17,219 residents, including 11,967 Swedish citizens of voting age. 44.3% voted for the left coalition and 54.2% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

===Residents with a foreign background===
In 2017 the number of people with a foreign background (persons born outside of Sweden or with two parents born outside of Sweden) was 4 643, or 27.86% of the population (16 665 in 2017). In 2002 the number of residents with a foreign background was (per the same definition) 2 468, or 17.79% of the population (13 875 in 2002). In 2017 there were 16 665 residents in Salem, of which 3 270 people (19.62%) were born in a country other than Sweden. Divided by country in the table below - the Nordic countries as well as the 12 most common countries of birth outside of Sweden for Swedish residents have been included, with other countries of birth bundled together by continent by Statistics Sweden.

<text>Hertford College ( ), previously known as Magdalen Hall, is a constituent college of the University of Oxford in England. It is located on Catte Street in the centre of Oxford, directly opposite the main gate to the Bodleian Library. The college’s Old and New Quadrangles are connected by the Bridge of Sighs. There are around 600 students at the college at any one time, comprising undergraduates, graduates and visiting students from overseas.

The first foundation on the Hertford site began in the 1280s as Hart Hall and became a college in 1740 but was dissolved in 1816. In 1820, the site was taken over by Magdalen Hall, which had emerged around 1490 on a site adjacent to Magdalen College. In 1874, Magdalen Hall was incorporated as a college, reviving the name Hertford College. In 1974, Hertford was part of the first group of all-male Oxford colleges to admit women.

Hertford College specialises in both Irish studies and Irish history. Hertford has long been associated with Ireland and can trace its connections back to the 16th century, when Irish Roman Catholics and Irish Protestants studied alongside each other at Hart Hall, one of the few places at Oxford that admitted Roman Catholics at the time.

Alumni of the college&#x27;s predecessor institutions include William Tyndale, John Donne, Thomas Hobbes, and Jonathan Swift. More recently, former students have included author Evelyn Waugh, the first female Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, the civil servants Jeremy Heywood and Olly Robbins, and the newsreaders and reporters Fiona Bruce, Carrie Gracie, Krishnan Guru-Murthy, and Natasha Kaplinsky. U.S. justice Byron White attended the college on a Rhodes scholarship but left to serve in World War II.

== Hart Hall and the first Hertford College ==

=== Hart Hall ===

The first Hertford College began life as Hart Hall (&quot;Aula Cervina&quot;) in the 1280s, a small tenement built roughly where the college&#x27;s Old Hall is today, a few paces along New College Lane on the southern side. In medieval Oxford, academic halls were primarily lodging houses for students and resident tutors.

The original tenement, mentioned in the deed of 1283, which was bought by Elias de Hertford from Walter de Grendon, mercer, lay between a tenement of the university (Blackhall) on the west, and a tenement of the Prioress of Studley on the east. In the deed by which Elias de Hertford sells it to John de Dokelynton in 1301, this last tenement is called Micheldhall. The deed was made over to his son, also Elias, in 1301. The name of the hall was likely a humorous reduction of the name of its founder&#x27;s home town, and allowed for the use of the symbol of a hart to be used for identification.

At that time, New College Lane was known as Hammer Hall Lane (named after a hall to the east, as New College had not then been founded), and its northern side was the old town wall. The corner of Hammer Hall Lane and Catte Street (which had a postern in the wall called Smithgate) was taken by Black Hall, which was the place of John Wycliffe&#x27;s imprisonment by the Vice-Chancellor around 1378. On the other side of Hart Hall along the lane was Shield Hall. On Catte Street itself was the entrance to Arthur Hall, which lay down a narrow passage behind Hart Hall, and Cat Hall (&quot;Aula Murilegorum&quot;), which stood further south, roughly where the Principal&#x27;s Lodgings now stand.

The younger Elias sold on Hart Hall (named in this deed as &#x27;le Herthalle&#x27;) after a month to a wealthy local fishmonger John of Ducklington, who, seven years later, bought Arthur Hall and annexed it to Hart Hall. In 1312, John sold the two halls to Walter de Stapledon, Bishop of Exeter, who desired to found a college. After just over a year, Stapledon moved his scholars to a larger site that he had purchased on Turl Street, which became Stapledon Hall, later Exeter College. However, Exeter College retained certain rights over Hart Hall, with which it plagued the hall&#x27;s development for centuries.

In 1379, Hart Hall and Black Hall were rented by William of Wykeham as a temporary home for his scholars as his New College, to the east along what became New College Lane, was being built. The first two Wardens of New College also appear as Principals of Hart Hall. Until the 17th century, there is evidence of scholars (including Thomas Ken) matriculating at Hart Hall while waiting for a vacancy at New College. By this time, it appears that Shield Hall had been partly taken over by Hart Hall and partly demolished to make way for New College&#x27;s cloister. Although Black Hall continued a separate existence, its principal was often the same as Hart Hall&#x27;s. In 1490, Hart Hall is described as having a library, which was unusual for a hall. In 1530, Hart Hall annexed Black Hall also. For some time, Cat Hall was leased by All Souls College, and then by Exeter College, until it also was subsumed into the growing Hart Hall early in the 16th century, giving the hall most of the land around what is today its Old Quadrangle.

In the latter half of the 16th century, Hart Hall became known as a refuge for Catholic recusants, particularly under Philip Randell as principal (1548–1599). Because of its connection with Exeter College and that college&#x27;s increasing puritanism, a number of Exeter&#x27;s tutors and scholars migrated to Hart Hall. The hall attracted an increasing number of Catholics from further afield, including the Jesuit tutor Richard Holtby in 1574, who was instrumental in the conversion of his student, and later Jesuit martyr and saint, Alexander Briant to Catholicism. Coming from a Catholic family, the English poet John Donne came up to Hart Hall in 1584.

Hart Hall expanded and new buildings were put up. In the early 17th century, the current Senior Common Room was built as lodgings for the principal. From this period also, the main entrance of the hall moved from being a narrow passage off New College Lane to a gate on Catte Street. By the late 17th century, Cat Hall is described as being used as &#x27;the ball-court of Hart Hall&#x27;. In the latter part of the 17th century, the principal, William Thornton, provided a proper gate for the Catte Street entrance of the hall, and decorated with a device of a drinking hart with the motto (&#x27;As the hart panteth after the water brooks&#x27;, taken from Psalm 42, verse 1, but in a peculiar translation). Although the current gatehouse is not Thornton&#x27;s original, it retains the design and motto, and houses the original decorated gates. It has been suggested that this frieze with its Latin motto is the real counterpart of the one translated for the waiting crowd by the title character of Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;.

In 1692, the political satirist Jonathan Swift was incorporated from Trinity College, Dublin, on the books of Hart Hall to receive his MA.

=== Richard Newton&#x27;s Hertford College ===
On 28 July 1710, the Rev Richard Newton was admitted principal of Hart Hall. Newton was a well-connected, energetic, educational reformer. He was appointed principal from &#x27;a very peaceful retirement&#x27; as Rector of Sudborough, where he was personal tutor to two brothers, who were both destined to be prime minister — Thomas Pelham-Holles and Henry Pelham — bringing the younger with him to Hart Hall. He dedicated himself to raising the hall from debt and securing a firmer financial endowment. Newton planned to redesign the hall around a proper quadrangle, with a tutor, or &quot;angler&quot;, and students living in each angle, and common buildings along the sides. However, only two buildings in his design were ever built: one angle in the south-east corner of the Old Quadrangle (nowadays known as the Cottage), and his simple stone Chapel on the south side (consecrated 25 November 1716), which now serves as the college&#x27;s Library. These buildings were financed entirely from Newton&#x27;s pocket, to the sum of around £2000 (around £ adjusted for inflation).

In 1720, Newton published his &quot;Scheme of Disciplines&quot; laying out his scheme of education with a view to obtaining a charter of incorporation, and, on 18 May 1723, he presented his petition for a charter. The proposal met immediate opposition, especially from Exeter College, exercising its old rights, and All Souls, desiring to expand northward onto the hall&#x27;s land. In addition, the appointments of principals for the various halls had established itself in a game of promotion, and a few would-be principals opposed the plan. John Conybeare, then a Fellow of Exeter, and later Bishop of Bristol, was Newton&#x27;s most ardent opponent, penning the book &quot;Calumny Refuted&quot; against Newton&#x27;s reforms. After years of struggle, Richard Newton&#x27;s statutes were accepted on 3 November 1739, and the charter incorporating &#x27;the Principal and Fellows of Hertford College&#x27; (&quot;Principalis et Socii Collegii Hertfordiensis&quot;) was received on 8 September 1740.

Newton&#x27;s Hertford was a relatively spartan college, having received no real endowment. Meals were simple and cheap, and the principal insisted on eating the same as everyone else. Students were expected to work hard, and, where Newton found the university&#x27;s education lacking, he supplemented it with disputations within the college. Newton allowed gentlemen-commoners to matriculate at the college, but they paid double fees for the same accommodation and food as the others. They were originally allowed to wear their coloured gowns and tufted caps, but Newton eventually made them wear the ordinary black gown. Thus, many a well-to-do family sent their sons to Hertford College to instil in them some disciplined education, unlike the privileged wining and dining had by gentlemen-commoners in other colleges.

=== Decline and dissolution ===
After Richard Newton&#x27;s death in 1753, the principalship of the college fell to a succession of men mostly lacking the desire or energy to continue their predecessor&#x27;s plan. One exception to this succession was David Durell, who built up the reputation and academic success of the college. Under Durell, the future statesman Charles James Fox matriculated in 1764 (Hertford, unusually for Oxford, was a Whig college). However, the scheme of four tutors in their respective angles was reduced to two, and cheaper junior fellows took over some of the burden of tutoring. It was at Hertford that the tutor Benjamin Blayney prepared his 1769 &quot;Standard Edition&quot; of the Authorized King James Version of the Bible. Apart from Durell&#x27;s principalship, the college went into decline due to the mismanagement of uninterested principals and the lack of decent endowments. In May 1805, Bernard Hodgson, last principal of Hertford College died, and no suitable successor could be found and agreed upon. By 1810, matriculation had ceased, and the last students were awarded their degrees. The last tutor and vice-principal, Richard Hewitt, continued to live in his rooms without students until May 1816, when a commission declared Hertford College dissolved.

== Magdalen Hall and the second Hertford College ==

=== Magdalen Hall ===
Magdalen Hall was founded around 1490 on a site to the west of Magdalen College and next to Magdalen&#x27;s grammar school. The site is now Magdalen&#x27;s St Swithun&#x27;s quadrangle. It took the name of an earlier Magdalen Hall in the High Street, which was founded by William Waynflete in 1448 and then closed on the opening of Magdalen College in 1458. The first master of the grammar school was appointed in 1480, and its original school building was erected in 1486. However, as the hall took independent students as well as those belonging to the college, it quickly became an independent institution under its own principal.

The hall was known for its adherence to the teachings of John Wycliffe; William Tyndale, translator of the English Bible and martyr, studied there. Another famous student of the hall was the political philosopher Thomas Hobbes, who came up in either 1601 or 1602. At the English Civil War, Magdalen Hall was known as a Puritan hall under the principalship of Henry Wilkinson. Famous Puritan graduates include Philip Nye, key adviser to Oliver Cromwell on matters of religion and regulation of the Church. The hall rarely used a badge of arms, but, when it did, it used the same arms as the college.

At the time of the demise of the first Hertford College, Magdalen College had long been searching for a way of expelling Magdalen Hall in order to expand into its buildings. Before the demise of Hertford, Magdalen College conspired to make its site ready to receive a transplanted Magdalen Hall. The current Lodge of Hertford College thus still bears the arms of Magdalen Hall (and so also of Magdalen College) beside those of Hertford College (and Hart Hall) and the university.

=== Move to Catte Street ===

John Macbride became both principal of Magdalen Hall and Lord Almoner&#x27;s Professor of Arabic in 1813, and plans to move the hall to the site of Hertford College were already afoot. On 15 March 1815, Magdalen College submitted a proposal for the move to Convocation. Magdalen College proposed to repair the Hertford buildings and defray the expense of Magdalen Hall&#x27;s move to the site, while the hall were to relinquish claim to their own buildings to Magdalen College. An Act of Parliament was passed supporting the plan, but no move was made until a fire accidentally started by an undergraduate on 9 January 1820 destroyed almost half of Magdalen Hall&#x27;s buildings. Not long after this, one of Hertford College&#x27;s buildings on Catte Street, so flimsy that it was known as the &#x27;paper building&#x27;, collapsed. With this motivation, the new foundation stone of Magdalen Hall was laid at the new site on 3 May 1820, and the hall&#x27;s migration was complete by 1822. The Catte Street frontage was pulled down and rebuilt, and several buildings had an extra storey added to them. Magdalen Hall expanded to fill the space, and became the largest hall by far, numbering 214 members in 1846. Macbride and his vice-principals were active in building up the refounded Magdalen Hall. To distance the hall from its namesake college, Macbride attempted to change the name to &#x27;Magdalene Hall&#x27;, but this change was never accepted. Macbride served as principal for 54 years, until his death in 1868. The Macbride Sermon, one of the University Sermons, is preached each Hilary term in the Chapel of Hertford College in his memory.

=== Refounding of Hertford College ===

During John Macbride&#x27;s principalship it became clear that the growing, energetic Magdalen Hall should be incorporated as a college to match its academic standing in the university. Since the name &quot;Magdalen College&quot; was already taken, the favoured option was the revival of &quot;Hertford College&quot;. Macbride was succeeded as principal in 1868 by his vice-principal, Richard Michell, who brought a bill before Parliament in 1873 for the incorporation of Magdalen Hall as Hertford College. The bill received significant financial support from Thomas Charles Baring, then newly elected MP for South Essex. Baring had been a Fellow of Brasenose College, and had offered a substantial endowment of fellowships and scholarships to that college, but it had been refused, because Brasenose rejected his conditions of restricting the funds to members of the Church of England. However, to ease the passage of the bill, Baring removed his condition to the first instalment of the endowment (subsequent instalments were restricted), and Magdalen Hall was incorporated as &quot;the Principal, Fellows, and Scholars of Hertford College&quot; (&quot;Principalis, Socii, et Scholastici Collegii Hertfordiensis&quot;) on 7 August 1874. Thus, Michell became the last principal of Magdalen Hall and the first principal of the refounded Hertford College.

Baring bought a house across New College Lane from the college to serve as fellows&#x27; lodgings (at some point the house was named Clarendon House), which was the first move of the college onto the northern side of New College Lane. That was soon followed by the purchase of other houses on that side of the road, which were collectively known as &quot;Ædes&quot;, and the old Chapel of Our Lady at Smithgate, which is now the Octagon, housing the Middle Common Room. Also during that period, a gatehouse was built on the Catte Street frontage and the old doors were reinstalled there. A new dining hall was built above the gatehouse, and much of the northern side of the Old Quadrangle, apart from Old Hall, was rebuilt.

In 1877, Henry Boyd succeeded Michell, becoming the second principal of the refounded Hertford College. His energy, good connections and longevity created the modern college as it is today. Boyd&#x27;s name appears carved on the landmark Bridge of Sighs, and he is commemorated by a memorial in the Chapel (to the left of the chancel) and a portrait in the Hall (at the west end of High Table). Boyd&#x27;s partnership with the architect Thomas Graham Jackson brought about the expansion of the college and its endowment with its iconic &quot;Anglo-Jackson&quot; buildings. In 1887, Jackson began work on the Gatehouse, the Hall and its spiral staircase, and the north range of the Old Quad. In 1901, Jackson started building the college&#x27;s site on the northern side of New College Lane. By 1908, he had completed a new Chapel, which he declared to be his favourite work. Eventually, after much opposition, he built the Bridge of Sighs, linking the Old and New Quads across New College Lane in 1913.

In the two world wars, a total of 171 members of Hertford College died. Those of World War I are commemorated by a memorial on the south wall of the chancel in the Chapel, while those of World War II are remembered in a memorial in the portico, to the right of the Chapel door. Notable among them is Major Percy Nugent FitzPatrick, son of James Percy FitzPatrick, who was killed near Cambrai on 14 December 1917. It was with the death of his son that James Percy FitzPatrick made the suggestion, after the war&#x27;s end, to keep a two-minute silence each year on Armistice Day.

In 1922, the novelist Evelyn Waugh came up to Hertford, famously feuding with his history tutor C. R. M. F. Cruttwell (who was to become the fourth principal of the refounded college, 1930–1939), and later naming a number of odious characters after him. Waugh wrote of his time at Hertford, &quot;I do no work here and never go to Chapel&quot;. He novelised his time at Oxford in &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, having his protagonist Charles Ryder at Hertford.

Starting from 1965, Hertford made a special effort to encourage applicants from state schools through the &quot;Hertford Scheme&quot;, established by Physics Fellow Neil Tanner, under which candidates were interviewed early, outside the standard application process, and could be offered a place at the college without having to sit the university entrance exam. That had the effect of dramatically raising academic standards within the college, and other colleges introduced similar initiatives. Today, around 70% of undergraduate students at the college come from UK state schools. The percentage of individuals from state schools (out of all UK applicants/students) is higher than at most Oxford colleges. The commitment to diversity is in keeping with Hertford&#x27;s earlier history of openness: in 1907 Hertford admitted the first African-American Rhodes Scholar, Alain Leroy Locke, after he had been refused by several other colleges.

Geoffrey Warnock served as the 9th Principal of the refounded college from 1971 until 1988. He presided over the latest period of growth, and established the college&#x27;s leftist credentials. In 1974, Hertford became one of the first five co-educational colleges in the university (the others being Brasenose, Jesus College, St Catherine&#x27;s, and Wadham). The college now has an almost equal gender balance, with slight variations from year to year. In memory of Warnock, the college named a student-accommodation building near Folly Bridge after him. He also has a memorial in the Chapel, and a portrait behind High Table in the Hall.

== Buildings ==
Hertford College&#x27;s main site is situated on Catte Street, New College Lane and Holywell Street. The site consists of three quadrangles: Old Quadrangle, New Quadrangle, and Holywell Quadrangle. The college also has three large groups of buildings for student accommodation near Folly Bridge: Warnock House, the Graduate Centre and Abingdon House. In addition to these, the college owns a number of houses around Oxford.

=== Old Quadrangle ===
The Old Quadrangle (known as Old Quad or OB Quad, for Old Buildings) is, as the name suggests, the oldest and the original quadrangle. Its entrance is the through the Gatehouse on Catte Street, directly opposite the main gates of the Bodleian Library. The Gatehouse is a late 19th-century building by Thomas Graham Jackson, bearing the image of a drinking hart above the archway. However, the wooden doors with their colourful floral decoration are the gates of Hart Hall from the 17th century. The Gatehouse houses the Lodge.

Through the Gatehouse, the quadrangle is laid out around a pleasant lawn with a few decorative trees. The lawn is off-limits during Michaelmas and Hilary terms but is accessible during Trinity term for sitting on (at any time) and croquet (on Fridays and Sundays only).

In the north-east corner of the quad is the Old Hall, the oldest remaining buildings of Hart Hall, dating from the 1570s. The Old Hall and its adjoining Buttery are now in regular use for dining, especially by the Fellows. Running southwards, along the eastern side of the quad, is a 17th-century building, with oriel windows tucked away on its southern end. Originally, the portion closest to the Old Hall was student accommodation, and the southern portion was the principal&#x27;s lodgings. Today the building is mostly taken over by the Senior Common Room, with the northern ground-floor room being the Old Library. In the south-east corner is the 18th-century Cottage, the only one of the planned four &#x27;angles&#x27; of Dr Newton that was ever built. Originally, this occupied the entire corner, around to what was the chapel (and is now the library). Its southern side was demolished to make way for Jackson&#x27;s Chapel.

The southern side of the quad consists of the Chapel, built in 1908 by Jackson, which has a particularly good acoustic. Its ante-chapel houses a stained-glass window depicting William Tyndale, made in 1911 for the British and Foreign Bible Society, and installed at Hertford in 1994. West of the Chapel is the Library, which was the previous chapel built in the 18th century by Newton. The Library possesses many fine, antique books, most of which belonged to the library of Magdalen Hall. Among these are many rare 17th-century manuscripts and an original edition of Thomas Hobbes&#x27;s &quot;Leviathan&quot; given as a personal gift to the college: Hobbes prepared this work while at Magdalen Hall.

The western side of the quad has the Gatehouse, with the Lodge, in its centre. On either side of this are slightly earlier buildings, the southern of which is the Principal&#x27;s Lodgings, and the northern mostly houses the college&#x27;s offices. In addition, the north-west building has access onto the Bridge of Sighs. Above the Gatehouse is the dining Hall, which is wood-panelled and hung with a number of college portraits. The hall is reached from the quad by a distinctive stone spiral staircase designed by Jackson, and inspired by the spiral staircase at the Château de Blois.

The northern side of the quad consists of a building by Jackson, much of which now houses the Bursary. The building is infamous as the site of the incident novelised in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; in which Sebastian Flyte, returning from a Bullingdon Club bender vomits through a window into a ground-floor room.

=== New Quadrangle ===
The New Quadrangle (known as New Quad or NB Quad, for New Buildings) is connected to the Old Quadrangle, across New College Lane, by the Bridge of Sighs, which was designed by Thomas Graham Jackson. The north-western corner of New Quad is taken up by the Indian Institute building, which is not part of Hertford College. Most of the New Buildings are early 20th-century designs by Jackson, except the slightly later frontage onto Holywell Street by T. H. Hughes, on the northern side of the quad. The quad is entered through a gate onto Catte Street, just opposite the Clarendon Building. New Quad is mostly used for undergraduate accommodation.

The most significant building in the quad is the Octagon, just north of the gate on Catte Street, which houses the Middle Common Room. It is the 16th-century Chapel of St Mary the Virgin at Smithgate, which formed a bastion in the town walls. An original carving of the scene of the Annunciation can be seen from Catte Street, just beside the gate.

=== Holywell Quadrangle ===

Holywell Quadrangle backs directly onto New Quad, and the two are connected by an arched corridor that also contains the steps down to Hertford&#x27;s subterranean bar. Holywell Quad was built in 1975, and is almost exclusively for first-year undergraduate housing. Its main features are a gate onto Holywell Street, the Junior Common Room in the south-east corner, and the Baring Room (named after Thomas Charles Baring, the college&#x27;s major benefactor) which is a multi-purpose hall at the top of the southern staircase.
== Student life ==
Undergraduate students are accommodated for the full three or four years of their study, either on the main site or on college-owned property primarily in North Oxford and the Folly Bridge area. A new Hertford Graduate Centre fronting the Isis was built near Folly Bridge and was opened in 2000.

Hertford is home to a college cat named Simpkin, who lives in the College Lodge and is the fourth of his lineage, collectively Simpkins, the collective noun for Hertford College cats; the original was called Simpkin and was introduced by the former college principal Geoffrey Warnock, named after the cat in the Beatrix Potter novel The Tailor of Gloucester. He is provided with a bursary by alumni to cover his food and veterinary treatment.

=== Academic selection ===
Hertford has one of the lowest admission rates in Oxbridge.
=== Academic achievement ===
Hertford&#x27;s exam results are slightly above average. In the Norrington Table of results over the period 2006–2012 it has come 17th, 9th, 18th, 6th, 12th, 5th and 23rd.

=== Sport ===
Hertford College Boat Club is among the leading Oxford college boat clubs: both its women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s first boats are in the first division of Torpids and Eights Week, with both M1 and W1 winning &quot;blades&quot; in the 2015 edition of Torpids. The boats and club room are in the Longbridges boathouse on the Isis. With the transition of Magdalen Hall to Hertford College in 1874, the old blue-black of the hall stopped racing in 1873, and the new red-white of the college took to the river in 1875. Within only seven years of its refoundation, the college came Head of the River in the annual college boat races, in 1881. On achieving that victory, the crew carried their boat all the way back to the college and burnt it just inside the gates. The college archives possess a letter detailing the club&#x27;s celebrations from the sub-librarian of the Bodleian Library, who spent the night on the scaffolding surrounding the work on the Old Schools Tower, directly opposite the Hertford gate, in case the fire spread to the library. In 2005, the boathouse was gutted by an arson attack carried out by the Animal Liberation Front, in protest against animal testing at the university. The new boathouse was rebuilt on the same site.

The college was endowed with a new gym in 2011 and has playing fields in New Marston, which include a pavilion with facilities for most major team sports. In August 2013 Hertford College Rugby Club became the first team from the UK to tour Mongolia in official partnership with the Mongolian Rugby Football Union. They played matches against The Mongolia Defense University and the Ulaan Baatar Warriors. Both matches were played in the national stadium and broadcast live on Mongolian national television. In 2017, the team returned to Mongolia, this time playing two matches against the Ulaanbaatar Warriors.

=== Music ===
Hertford College has the largest and most active music society of any Oxford college, drawing in musicians from around the university, with ensembles including the Hertford College Orchestra, the Hertford College Chapel Choir, the Hertford College Wind Band, the Hertford College Jazz Band and the Hertford College Bruckner Orchestra. 
There are two competitive organ scholarships. The Chapel&#x27;s fine acoustic lends itself to concerts and recitals, and it is frequently used for recording.

<text>Jesus College (in full: Jesus College in the University of Oxford of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Foundation) is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England. It is in the centre of the city, on a site between Turl Street, Ship Street, Cornmarket Street and Market Street. The college was founded by Queen Elizabeth I of England on 27 June 1571. A major driving force behind the establishment of the college was Hugh Price (or Ap Rhys), a churchman from Brecon in Wales. The oldest buildings, in the first quadrangle, date from the 16th and early 17th centuries; a second quadrangle was added between about 1640 and about 1713, and a third quadrangle was built in about 1906. Further accommodation was built on the main site to mark the 400th anniversary of the college, in 1971, and student flats have been constructed at sites in north and east Oxford. A fourth quadrangle was completed in 2021.

There are about 475 students at any one time; the Principal of the college is Sir Nigel Shadbolt. Former students include Harold Wilson (who was twice Prime Minister of the United Kingdom), Kevin Rudd (Prime Minister of Australia), Norman Washington Manley (Prime Minister of Jamaica), T. E. Lawrence (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;), Angus Buchanan (winner of the Victoria Cross), Viscount Sankey (Lord Chancellor), Edwin Yoder (Pulitzer Prize winning journalist), Roger Parry (media and technology entrepreneur) and over 30 Members of Parliament. Past or present fellows of the college include the historians Sir Goronwy Edwards, Yuval Noah Harari and Niall Ferguson, the philosopher Galen Strawson, and the political philosopher John Gray. Past students and fellows in the sciences include John Houghton (physicist) and Nobel Laureate Peter J. Ratcliffe.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===


Jesus College was founded on 27 June 1571, when Elizabeth I issued a royal charter. It was the first Protestant college to be founded at the university, and it is the only Oxford college to date from Elizabeth&#x27;s reign. It was the first new Oxford college since 1555, in the reign of Queen Mary, when Trinity College and St John&#x27;s College were founded as Roman Catholic colleges. The foundation charter named a principal (David Lewis), eight fellows, eight scholars, and eight commissioners to draw up the statutes for the college. The commissioners included Hugh Price, who had petitioned the queen to found a college at Oxford &quot;that he might bestow his estate of the maintenance of certain scholars of Wales to be trained up in good letters.&quot; The college was originally intended primarily for the education of clergy. The particular intention was to satisfy a need for dedicated, learned clergy to promote the Elizabethan Religious Settlement in the parishes of England, Ireland and Wales. The college has since broadened the range of subjects offered, beginning with the inclusion of medicine and law, and now offers almost the full range of subjects taught at the university. The letters patent issued by Elizabeth I made it clear that the education of a priest in the 16th century included more than just theology, however:

Price continued to be closely involved with the college after its foundation. On the strength of a promised legacy, worth £60 a year on his death (approximately £ in present-day terms), he requested and received the authority to appoint the new college&#x27;s principal, fellows and scholars. He financed early building work in the college&#x27;s front quadrangle, but on his death in 1574 it transpired that the college received only a lump sum of around £600 (approximately £ in present-day terms). Problems with his bequest meant that it was not received in full for about 25 years. As the college had no other donors at this time, &quot;for many years the college had buildings but no revenue&quot;.

=== 17th century ===

The main benefactor, other than the King, was Eubule Thelwall, from Ruthin, North Wales, who became Principal in 1621; he succeeded in securing a new charter and statutes for the college from James I, having spent £5,000 of his own money on the hall and chapel, which earned him the title of its second founder. Thelwall died on 8 October 1630, aged 68 and was buried in Jesus College Chapel where a monument was erected to his memory by his brother Sir Bevis Thelwall (Page of the King&#x27;s Bedchamber and Clerk of the Great Wardrobe).

Other benefactions in the 17th century include Herbert Westfaling, the Bishop of Hereford, who left enough property to support two fellowships and scholarships (with the significant proviso that &quot;my kindred shallbe always preferred before anie others&quot;). Sir Eubule Thelwall (principal 1621–1630) spent much of his own money on the construction of a chapel, hall and library for the college. The library, constructed above an over-weak colonnade, was pulled down under the principalship of Francis Mansell (1630–1649), who also built two staircases of residential accommodation to attract the sons of Welsh gentry families to the college.

The English Civil War &quot;all but destroyed the corporate life of the college.&quot; Mansell was removed from his position as principal and Michael Roberts was installed. After the Restoration, Mansell was briefly reinstated as principal, before resigning in favour of Leoline Jenkins. It was Jenkins (principal 1661–1673) who secured the long-term viability of the college. On his death, in 1685, he bequeathed a large complex of estates, acquired largely by lawyer friends from the over-mortgaged landowners of the Restoration period. These estates allowed the college&#x27;s sixteen fellowships and scholarships to be filled for the first time – officially, sixteen of each had been supported since 1622, but the college&#x27;s income was too small to keep all occupied simultaneously. In 1713, the bequest of Welsh clergyman and former student Edmund Meyricke established a number of scholarships for students from north Wales, although these are now available to all Welsh students.

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===

The 18th century, in contrast to the disruption of the 17th century, was a comparatively quiet time for the college. A historian of the college, J. N. L. Baker, wrote that the college records for this time &quot;tell of little but routine entries and departures of fellows and scholars&quot;. The Napoleonic Wars saw a reduction in the numbers of students and entries in the records for the purchase of muskets and other items for college members serving in the university corps. After the war, numbers rose, to an average of twenty new students per year between 1821 and 1830. However, debts owed to the college had increased, perhaps due to the economic effects of the war – by 1832, the college was owed £986 10s 5d (approximately £ in present-day terms). During the first half of the 19th century, the academic strength of the college diminished: scholarships were sometimes not awarded because of a lack of suitable candidates, and numbers fell: there were only seven new entrants in 1842. Ernest Hardy wrote in his history of the college in 1899 that it had been becoming &quot;increasingly evident for years... that the exclusive connection with Wales was ruining the college as a place of education.&quot;

A Royal Commission was appointed in 1852 to investigate the university. The college wished to retain its links with Wales, and initial reforms were limited despite the wishes of the commissioners: those scholarships that were limited to particular parts of Wales were opened to the whole of Wales, and half of the fellowships awarded were to remain open only to Welshmen if and so long as the Principal and Fellows shall deem it expedient for the interests of education in connection with the Principality of Wales. All the scholarships at the college, except for two, and all the exhibitions were still restricted to students from Wales. The numbers of students at the college still fell, despite prizes being awarded for success in university examinations. Daniel Harper, principal from 1877 to 1895, noted the continuing academic decline. Speaking in 1879, he noted that fewer students from the college were reaching high standards in examinations, and that more Welsh students were choosing to study at other Oxford colleges in preference to Jesus. A further Royal Commission was appointed. This led to further changes at the college: in 1882, the fellowships reserved to Welshmen were made open to all, and only half (instead of all) of the 24 scholarships were to be reserved for Welsh candidates. Thereafter, numbers gradually rose and the non-Welsh element at the college increased, so that by 1914 only about half of the students were Welsh.

=== 20th century ===
During the First World War, &quot;the college in the ordinary sense almost ceased to exist&quot;. From 129 students in the summer of 1914, numbers dropped to 36 in the spring of 1916. Some refugee students from Belgium and Serbia lodged in empty rooms in the college during 1916, and officers of the Royal Flying Corps resided from August 1916 to December 1918. After the war, numbers rose and fellowships were added in new subjects: history (1919 and 1933); theology (1927); physics (1934); a second fellowship in chemistry (1924); and modern languages (lectureship 1921, fellowship 1944). The improved teaching led to greater success in university examinations and prizes.
In the inter-war years (1918–1939) Jesus was seen by some as a small college and something of a backwater; it attracted relatively few pupils from the public schools traditionally seen as the most prestigious. The college did, however, attract many academically able entrants from the grammar schools (particularly those in northern England and Scotland). Among these grammar-school boys was Harold Wilson, who would later become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. During the Second World War, many of the fellows served in the armed forces or carried out war work in Oxford. The college remained full of students, though, as it provided lodgings for students from other colleges whose buildings had been requisitioned, and also housed officers on military courses.

The college had its own science laboratories from 1907 to 1947, which were overseen (for all but the last three years) by the physical chemist David Chapman, a fellow of the college from 1907 to 1944. At the time of their closure, they were the last college-based science laboratories at the university. They were named the Sir Leoline Jenkins laboratories, after a former principal of the college. The laboratories led to scientific research and tuition (particularly in chemistry) becoming an important part of the college&#x27;s academic life. The brochure produced for the opening ceremony noted that the number of science students at the college had increased rapidly in recent years, and that provision of college laboratories would assist the tuition of undergraduates, as well as attracting to Jesus College graduates of the University of Wales who wished to continue their research at Oxford. A link between one of the college science lecturers and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) led to 17 students joining ICI between the two World Wars, some, such as John Rose, reaching senior levels in the company. The laboratories became unnecessary when the university began to provide centralised facilities for students; they were closed in 1947.

The quatercentenary of the college, in 1971, saw the opening of the Old Members&#x27; Buildings in the third quadrangle. Further student accommodation has been built at the sports ground and at a site in north Oxford. In 1974, Jesus was among the first group of five men&#x27;s colleges to admit women as members, the others being Brasenose, Wadham, Hertford and St Catherine&#x27;s; between one-third and one-half of the undergraduates are women. A long-standing rivalry with nearby Exeter College reached a peak in 1979, with seven police vehicles and three fire engines involved in dealing with trouble in Turl Street. Sir John Habakkuk (principal 1967–1984) and Sir Peter North (principal 1984–2005) both served terms as Vice-Chancellor of the university, from 1973 to 1977 and from 1993 to 1997 respectively.

===21st century===
The hereditary visitor of the college remains the Earls of Pembroke and Montgomery &quot;ex officio&quot;. The current visitor is William Herbert, 18th Earl of Pembroke, 15th Earl of Montgomery. Jesus, Magdalene College, Cambridge and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge are the only three Oxbridge colleges that continue to prescribe by statute visitations held by hereditary peers.

== Location and buildings ==
The main buildings are located in the centre of Oxford, between Turl Street, Ship Street, Cornmarket Street and Market Street. The main entrance is on Turl Street. The buildings are arranged in three quadrangles, the first quadrangle containing the oldest college buildings and the third quadrangle the newest. The foundation charter gave to the college a site between Market Street and Ship Street (which is still occupied by the college) as well as the buildings of a defunct university academic hall on the site, called White Hall. The buildings that now surround the first quadrangle were erected in stages between 1571 and the 1620s; the principal&#x27;s lodgings were the last to be built. Progress was slow because the new college lacked the &quot;generous endowments&quot; that earlier colleges enjoyed. Before new buildings were completed, the students lived in the old buildings of White Hall.

=== First quadrangle ===

The chapel was dedicated on 28 May 1621, and extended in 1636. The architectural historian Giles Worsley has described the chapel&#x27;s east window (added in 1636) as an instance of Gothic Revival architecture, rather than Gothic Survival, since a choice was made to use an outdated style – classical architecture had become accepted as &quot;the only style in which it was respectable to build&quot;. Jonathan Edwards (principal from 1686 to 1712) is reported to have spent £1,000 (approximately £ in present-day terms) during his lifetime on the interior of the chapel, including the addition of a screen separating the main part of the chapel from the ante-chapel (at the west end) in 1693. In 1853, stained glass by George Hedgeland was added to the east window. In 1863, the architect George Edmund Street was appointed to renovate the chapel. The arch of the chancel was widened, the original Jacobean woodwork was removed (save for the screen donated by Edwards and the pulpit), new seats were installed, new paving was placed in the main part of the chapel and a stone reredos was added behind the altar. Views of the changes have differed. On 21 October 1864, &quot;Building News&quot; reported that the restoration was nearing completion and was of &quot;a very spirited character&quot;. It said that the new &quot;handsome&quot; arch showed the east window &quot;to great advantage&quot;, with &quot;other improvements&quot; including a &quot;handsome reredos&quot;. Ernest Hardy, principal from 1921 to 1925, said that the work was &quot;ill-considered&quot;, described the reredos as &quot;somewhat tawdry&quot; and said that the Jacobean woodwork had been sold off too cheaply. In contrast, the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner called the reredos &quot;heavily gorgeous&quot;.

The principal of the college resides in the lodgings, a Grade I listed building, on the north side of the first quadrangle between the chapel (to the east) and the hall (to the west). They were the last part of the first quadrangle to be built. Sir Eubule Thelwall, principal from 1621 to 1630, built the lodgings at his own expense, to include (in the words of the antiquarian Anthony Wood) &quot;a very fair dining-room adorned with wainscot curiously engraven&quot;. The shell-hood over the doorway (which Pevsner called &quot;beautiful&quot;) was added at some point between 1670 and 1740; Pevsner dates it to about 1700.

The hall has been said to be &quot;among the most impressive of all the Oxford college halls&quot;, with its &quot;fine panelling, austere ceiling, and its notable paintings&quot;. Like the chapel, it was largely built by Griffith Powell between 1613 and 1620, and was finally completed soon after his death in 1620. Pevsner noted the &quot;elaborately decorated columns&quot; of the screen (installed in 1634) and the dragons along the frieze, and said that it was one of the earliest examples in Oxford of panelling using four &quot;L&quot; shapes around a centre. In 1741 and 1742, the oak-beamed roof was covered with plaster to make rooms in the roof space. Pevsner described the 1741 cartouche on the north wall, which contains the college crest, as &quot;large [and] rich&quot;. The hall contains a portrait of Elizabeth I, as well as portraits of former principals and benefactors. There are also portraits by court artists of two other monarchs who were college benefactors: Charles I (by Anthony van Dyck) and Charles II (by Sir Peter Lely).

In 1640, Francis Mansell (appointed principal in 1630) began construction of a second quadrangle with buildings along the north and south sides; further work was interrupted by the English Civil War. Work began again in 1676, and the library (now the Fellows&#x27; Library) was completed by 1679. Under Jonathan Edwards (principal from 1688 to 1712), further rooms were built to complete the quadrangle; the project was completed just after his death in 1712. Pevsner described the second quadrangle as &quot;a uniform composition&quot;, noting the &quot;regular fenestration by windows with round-arched lights, their hood-moulds forming a continuous frieze&quot;. The Dutch gables have ogee sides and semi-circular pediments. The writer Simon Jenkins said that the quadrangle has &quot;the familiar Oxford Tudor windows and decorative Dutch gables, crowding the skyline like Welsh dragons&#x27; teeth and lightened by exuberant flower boxes&quot;.

The Fellows&#x27; Library contains bookcases decorated with strapwork dating from about 1628, which were used in an earlier library in the college. Hardy&#x27;s opinion was that, &quot;if only it had an open timber roof instead of the plain ceiling, it would be one of the most picturesque College Libraries&quot;. Another author said (in 1914, after the provision of a library for undergraduates elsewhere in the quadrangle) that it was &quot;one of the most charming of Oxford libraries, and one of the least frequented&quot;. It holds 11,000 antiquarian printed books and houses many of the college&#x27;s rare texts, including a Greek bible dating from 1545 and signed by Philipp Melanchthon and others, much of the library of the scholar and philosopher Lord Herbert of Cherbury and 17th-century volumes by Robert Boyle and Sir Isaac Newton.

=== Third quadrangle ===

The long but narrow third quadrangle adjoins Ship Street, on the north of the site and to the west of the garden of the principal&#x27;s lodgings, where the college has owned some land since its foundation. In the 18th century, this was home to the college stables. A fire in 1904 led to the demolition of the stables and the gateway to Ship Street. Replacement buildings adjoining Ship Street, effectively creating a third quadrangle for the college, were constructed between 1906 and 1908. It contained the college&#x27;s science laboratories (now closed) and a new gate-tower, as well as further living accommodation and a library for students, known as the Meyricke Library, after a major donor – there had been an undergraduate library in the second quadrangle since 1865, known as the Meyricke Library from 1882 onwards.

The Old Members&#x27; Building, which contains a music room, 24 study-bedrooms and some lecture rooms, was built between 1969 and 1971. It was built after a fundraising appeal to Old Members to mark the college&#x27;s quatercentenary, and was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1971. The Fellows&#x27; Garden is between the Old Members&#x27; Building and the rear of the rooms on the west side of the second quadrangle. In 2002, a two-year project to rebuild the property above the college-owned shops on Ship Street was completed. As part of the work, the bottom floor was converted from rooms occupied by students and fellows into a new Junior Common Room (JCR), to replace the common room in the second quadrangle, which was by then too small to cope with the increased numbers of students.

=== Fourth quadrangle ===
In 2019, work began on redevelopment of a commercial property, Northgate House, owned by the college on the corner of Cornmarket and Market Streets, to provide new student accommodation above retail facilities with a new quad and other teaching facilities behind, projected for completion to mark the college&#x27;s 450th anniversary in 2021. The new building is named the Cheng Yu-tung building after the late billionaire entrepreneur and philanthropist Cheng Yu-tung whose family provided the principal donation for the project.
=== Other buildings ===
The college purchased of land in east Oxford (near the Cowley Road) in 1903 for use as a sports ground. Residential accommodation was first built at the sports ground in 1967 (Thelwall House, rebuilt in 1998), with additions between 1988 and 1990 (Hugh Price House and Leoline Jenkins House). A further development, known as Hazel Court (after Alfred Hazel, principal 1925–1944), was built in 2000, bringing the total number of students who can be housed at the sports ground to 135.

Donations from Edwin Stevens, an Old Member of the college, enabled the construction in 1974 of student flats at a site in north Oxford on the Woodstock Road, named &quot;Stevens Close&quot; in his honour.

The college also owns a number of houses on Ship Street, which are used for student accommodation. It purchased a further site in Ship Street at a cost of £1.8M, which was converted at a projected cost of £5.5M to provide 31 student rooms with en-suite facilities, a 100-seat lecture theatre and other teaching rooms. The Ship Street Centre was officially opened by the Chancellor of the University of Oxford, Lord Patten of Barnes, on 25 September 2010.

== People associated with the college ==

=== Principals and Fellows ===

The college is run by the Principal and Fellows. The Principal must be &quot;a person distinguished for literary or scientific attainments, or for services in the work of education in the University or elsewhere&quot;. The Principal has &quot;pre-eminence and authority over all members of the College and all persons connected therewith&quot; and exercises &quot;a general superintendence in all matters relating to education and discipline&quot;. The current Principal, Sir Nigel Shadbolt, was appointed in 2015. Fourteen Principals have been former students of the college: Griffith Powell (elected in 1613) was the first and Alfred Hazel (elected in 1925) was the most recent. The longest-serving principal was Henry Foulkes, from 1817 to 1857.

When the college was founded in 1571, the first charter installed David Lewis as Principal and named eight others as the first Fellows of the college. The statutes of 1622 allowed for 16 Fellows. There is now no limit on the number of Fellowships that the Governing Body can create. The college statutes provide for various categories of Fellows. Professorial Fellows are those Professors and Readers of the university who are allocated to the college by the university. One of these professorships is the Jesus Professor of Celtic, which is the only chair in Celtic Studies at an English university. Celtic scholars such as Sir John Rhys and Ellis Evans have held the position since its creation in 1877. The chair is currently held by David Willis, who took up the position in 2020 after the previous holder Thomas Charles-Edwards retired in 2011. The zoologists Charles Godfray and Paul Harvey are both Professorial Fellows. Official Fellows are those who hold tutorial or administrative appointments in the college. Past Official Fellows include the composer and musicologist John Caldwell, the historians Sir Goronwy Edwards and Niall Ferguson, the philosopher Galen Strawson and the political philosopher John Gray. There are also Senior and Junior Research Fellows. Principals and Fellows who retire can be elected as Emeritus Fellows.

A further category is that of Welsh Supernumerary Fellows, who are, in rotation, the Vice-Chancellors of Cardiff University, Swansea University, Lampeter University, Aberystwyth University, Bangor University and the University of Wales College of Medicine. There is one Welsh Supernumerary Fellow at a time, holding the position for not longer than three years. The first of these was John Viriamu Jones in 1897.

The college formerly had a category of missionary Fellows, known as Leoline Fellows after their founder, Leoline Jenkins (a former principal). In his will in 1685, he stated that &quot;It is but too obvious that the persons in Holy Orders employed in his Majesty&#x27;s fleet at sea and foreign plantations are too few.&quot; To address this, he established two Fellowships at Jesus College, whose holders should serve as clergy &quot;in any of his Majesty&#x27;s fleets or in his Majesty&#x27;s plantations&quot; under the direction of the Lord High Admiral and the Bishop of London respectively. The last of these, Frederick de Winton, was appointed in 1876 and held his Fellowship until his death in 1932. This category was abolished in 1877 by the Oxford and Cambridge Universities Commission, without prejudice to the rights of existing holders such as de Winton. Another category of Fellowship that was abolished in the 19th century was that of the King Charles I Fellows, founded by King Charles in 1636 and tenable by natives of the Channel Islands in an attempt by him to &quot;reclaim the Channel Islands from the extreme Calvinism which characterised them.&quot; The first such Fellow was Daniel Brevint.

=== Honorary Fellows ===
The Governing Body has the ability to elect &quot;distinguished persons&quot; to Honorary Fellowships. Under the current statutes of the college, Honorary Fellows cannot vote at meetings of the Governing Body and do not receive financial reward. They can be called upon, however, to help decide whether to dismiss or discipline members of academic staff (including the Principal).

Three former principals of the college (John Christie, Sir John Habakkuk and Sir Peter North) have been elected Honorary Fellows on retirement. Some Honorary Fellows were formerly Fellows of the college, others were Old Members of the college, and some were in both categories. Others had no previous academic connection with the college before their election. Some of these were distinguished Welshmen – for example, the Welsh businessman Sir Alfred Jones was elected in 1902 and the Welsh judge Sir Samuel Evans, President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court, was elected in 1918. The Welsh politician David Lloyd George was elected to an Honorary Fellowship in 1910 when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer. He wrote to Sir John Rhys, the Principal at the time, to thank the college for the honour, saying:

The first three Honorary Fellows, all former students of the college, were elected in October 1877: John Rhys, the first Jesus Professor of Celtic (later an Official Fellow (1881–1895) and Principal (1895–1915)); the historian John Richard Green; and the poet Lewis Morris. The college noted in 1998 that the number of Honorary Fellows of the college was markedly below the average of other Oxford colleges and it adopted a more methodical approach to increase numbers. Seven Honorary Fellows were elected that year, followed by another five in 1999. The college&#x27;s Honorary Fellows have included two Old Members who later became Prime Minister of their respective countries: Norman Washington Manley, who studied at Jesus College as a Rhodes Scholar and who was Chief Minister of Jamaica from 1955 to 1962, and Harold Wilson, who was twice British Prime Minister (1964–1970 and 1974–1976). The first female honorary fellow was the journalist and broadcaster Francine Stock.

=== Alumni ===

Notable former students of the college have included politicians, scientists, writers, entertainers and academics. T. E. Lawrence (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;), known for his part in the Arab Revolt of 1916–1918 and for his writings including &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;, studied history at the college. His thesis on Crusader castles (the fieldwork for which marked the beginning of his fascination with the Middle East) is held in the Fellows&#x27; Library. Other former students include Harold Wilson, who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1964 to 1970 and 1974–1976, Kevin Rudd who was Prime Minister of Australia, Norman Washington Manley who was Prime Minister of Jamaica, Pixley ka Isaka Seme (a founder and president of the African National Congress), Sir William Williams (Speaker of the House of Commons 1680–1685), and Lord Sankey (Lord Chancellor 1929–1935). Members of Parliament from the three main political parties in the United Kingdom have attended the college, as have politicians from Australia (Neal Blewett),&lt;ref name=&quot;FN1998/9&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand (Harold Rushworth), Sri Lanka (Lalith Athulathmudali) and the United States (Heather Wilson).

The founders&#x27; hopes that their college would produce prominent Welsh clergy were fulfilled in no small measure when a former student, A. G. Edwards, was elected the first Archbishop of Wales when the Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920. Two later Archbishops of Wales, Glyn Simon (Archbishop from 1968 to 1971) and Gwilym Owen Williams (Archbishop 1971–1982) were also educated at the college. Celticists associated with the college include Sir John Rhys, Sir John Morris-Jones, and Sir Thomas (T. H.) Parry-Williams, whilst the list of historians includes the college&#x27;s first graduate, David Powel, who published the first printed history of Wales in 1584, the Victorian historian J. R. Green, and the historian Richard J. Evans. Angus Buchanan won the Victoria Cross during the First World War. Record-breaking quadriplegic solo sailor Hilary Lister was also a student here, whilst from the field of arts and entertainment there are names such as Elwyn Brook-Jones, actor, (1911–1962), Magnus Magnusson, presenter of &quot;Mastermind&quot;, the National Poet of Wales Gwyn Thomas, and television weather presenters Kirsty McCabe and Siân Lloyd. Nigel Hitchin, the Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford since 1997, studied at the college, as did Edward Hinds (a physicist who won the Rumford Medal in 2008), Chris Rapley (director of the Science Museum), and the zoologists Edward Bagnall Poulton and James Brontë Gatenby.

== Student life ==
There are about 325 undergraduates and 150 postgraduates. About half of the undergraduates studied at state schools before coming to Oxford, and about 10% are from overseas. Students from the college participate in a variety of extracurricular activities. Some contribute to student journalism for &quot;Cherwell&quot; or &quot;The Oxford Student&quot;. The Turl Street Arts Festival (a week-long student-organised event) is held annually in conjunction with the two other colleges on Turl Street, Exeter and Lincoln colleges. The festival, which takes place in Fifth Week of Hilary term, includes exhibitions, plays and concerts. Although the college does not award choral scholarships, the chapel choir is well-attended by college members and others. The choir is non-auditioning for college members, and is run by one or more undergraduate organ scholars.

Every three years, the college co-organises the Somerville-Jesus Ball on the grounds of Somerville College. The last ball was held in April 2022.

==Library and archives==

The main library at Jesus College is the Meyricke Library; older printed books are housed in the historic Fellows’ Library. The medieval manuscripts should be directed to re held at the Bodleian Libraries, where they are on deposit. The archives hold the administrative documents of the college since its foundation, as well as a large collection of documents, photographs, and printed papers. There is also an extensive Celtic Library. In 2021, the College Librarian was Owen McKnight.

Medieval and early modern manuscripts owned at Jesus College date back to the 11th century and since 1886 have been deposited at the Bodleian Libraries. Some of the most important Welsh language manuscripts are at Jesus College, including the Red Book of Hergest (1285–1320). Modern manuscripts include T.E. Lawrence’s undergraduate thesis (MS. 181).

=== Sports ===
In common with many Oxford colleges, Jesus provides sporting facilities for students, including playing fields at a site in east Oxford off the Cowley Road known as Bartlemas (for its proximity to St Bartholomew&#x27;s Chapel). Football, rugby, netball, field hockey, cricket, and tennis can be played there. Squash courts are at a separate city-centre site on St Cross Road. The college also provides students with membership of the university&#x27;s gym and swimming pool on Iffley Road.

Jesus College Boat Club (commonly abbreviated to JCBC) is the rowing club for members of the college. The club was formed in 1835, but rowing at the college predates the foundation of the club: a boat from the college was involved in the earliest recorded races between college crews at Oxford in 1815, when it competed against a crew from Brasenose College. These may have been the only two colleges who had boats racing at that time, and the Brasenose boat was usually victorious. Neither the men&#x27;s nor the women&#x27;s 1st VIIIs have been &quot;Head of the River&quot; during Eights Week, the main college races, but the women&#x27;s 1st VIII was Head of the River in the spring races, Torpids, between 1980 and 1983. Jesus boats have also had other successful seasons: the 1896 Jesus College boat had a reputation of being one of the faster boats in the university, and the women&#x27;s 1st VIII of 1993 won their &quot;blades&quot; in the first divisions of both Torpids and Eights Week, an achievement that led to the crew being described in the &quot;Jesus College Record&quot; as vying &quot;not just for the College team of the decade, but perhaps for the team of the last three decades&quot;, in any sport.

A number of college members have rowed for the university against Cambridge University in the Boat Race and the Women&#x27;s Boat Race. Barney Williams, a Canadian rower who studied at the college, won a silver medal in rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and participated in the Boat Race in 2005 and 2006. Other students who rowed while at the college have achieved success in other fields, including John Sankey, who became Lord Chancellor, Alwyn Williams, who became Bishop of Durham, and Maurice Jones, who became Principal of St David&#x27;s College, Lampeter. Another college rower, James Page, was appointed Secretary of the Amateur Rowing Association and coached both the Oxford and Cambridge University boat clubs.

The college boathouse, which is shared with the boat club of Keble College, is in Christ Church Meadow, on the Isis (as the River Thames is called in Oxford). It dates from 1964 and replaced a moored barge used by spectators and crew-members. The last college barge had been purchased from one of the Livery Companies of the City of London in 1911. It is now a floating restaurant further down the Thames at Richmond, and for some years was painted in the college scarf of green and white.

=== Welsh connection ===

Education in Wales had been stimulated by the foundation of schools during the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI: King Henry VIII Grammar School in Abergavenny 1542 and Christ College, Brecon 1541 were established in the 1540s, and Friars School, Bangor dates from 1557. However, despite the numbers of Welsh students coming to Oxford University as a result, there was no special provision for Welshmen before 1571. Despite the links with Wales that Hugh Price and many of the founding Fellows had, neither the 1571 charter nor any of the later charters limited entry to the college to Welshmen. Nevertheless, the college students were predominantly Welsh from the outset, and the college became &quot;the pinnacle of the academic ambition of the young men of Wales&quot;. Many of the fellows in the past were Welsh, since when new fellowships were created by benefactions (often by people of Welsh descent) there was frequently a stipulation that the recipients would be related to the donor or come from a specified part of Wales. These specific limitations were removed as part of reforms of Oxford University during the 19th century. Between 1571 and 1915, only one Principal (Francis Howell, 1657–1660) was not from Wales or of Welsh descent.

Jesus still has a particular association with Wales and is often referred to as &quot;the Welsh college&quot;. The college is home to the university&#x27;s Professor of Celtic, and a specialist Celtic library in addition to the college&#x27;s normal library. Meyrick scholarships, from the bequest of Edmund Meyrick in 1713, are awarded for academic merit where the student is a native of Wales (or the child of a native of Wales), able to speak Welsh or was educated for the last three years of secondary school in Wales.

The college&#x27;s undergraduate gossip sheet is entitled &quot;The Sheepshagger&quot; in allusion to an offensive joke about Welsh people&#x27;s supposed penchant for sheep. Furthermore, the Welshness of the college is self-perpetuating, as Welsh students will often apply to Jesus because it is seen as the Welsh college. Old members recall the college having a majority of Welsh members until well into the 20th century; today, however, around 15% of undergraduates come from Wales. For comparison, residents of Wales comprise just under 5% of the United Kingdom population (2.9 million out of a total of 58.8 million at the time of the 2001 Census).

In modern times, the Welsh roots of the college come to the fore most prominently on Saint David&#x27;s Day. The feast is marked by a choral Evensong in the chapel, decorated for the occasion with daffodils. The service, including music, is conducted entirely in Welsh (despite only a small minority of the choir usually being native speakers of the language). It is generally well attended by members of the Welsh community in Oxford. The college&#x27;s annual St. David&#x27;s Day Dinner traditionally culminates with the serving of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn&#x27;s Pudding. The name recalls the Welsh politician and prominent Jacobite who attended the college early in the 18th century.

The Welsh connection is also evident in the college&#x27;s outreach activities, such as organising a summer school for Welsh students in partnership with the Welsh Government&#x27;s Seren Network.

== Silverware ==
The college&#x27;s collection of silverware includes a silver-gilt punch bowl, presented by Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn in 1732. The bowl, which weighs more than and holds , was used at a dinner held in the Radcliffe Camera in 1814, to celebrate what was supposed to be the final defeat of Napoleon. Those present at the dinner included the Tsar, the King of Prussia, Blücher, Metternich, the Prince Regent, the Duke of York and the Duke of Wellington. There is a college tradition that the bowl will be presented to anyone who can meet two challenges. The first is to put arms around the bowl at its widest point; the second is to drain the bowl of strong punch. The bowl measures at its widest point, and so the first challenge has only been accomplished rarely; the second challenge has not been met.

== Coat of arms ==
The college&#x27;s coat of arms, in heraldic terminology, is &quot;Vert, three stags trippant argent attired or&quot;. The arms are not those of Hugh Price. His arms, according to their depiction in the margins of his will, were gules (red) a chevron ermine between three fleurs-des-lis. The arms were not granted or authorised by the College of Arms, but the length of time for which they have been used has given them a prescriptive authority.
The earliest depiction of the arms was thought to be about 1590, in a document held by the College of Arms, which refers to the stags appearing on a blue (in heraldic terms, azure) background but subsequent examination of this document by Peter Donoghue, Bluemantle Pursuivant shows that the arms were added c.1680. The first known appearance of the arms is therefore on John Speed&#x27;s Map of Oxfordshire in 1605 with a blue field. The green field made its appearance by 1619 in an armorial quarry painted by one of the Van Linge brothers. The green background became generally (but not universally) used by the 1730s, still appearing as horizontal hatchings indicating azure were in use on bookplates for the college library as late as 1761.

There are similarities with the arms of Lincoln College, Oxford, where one of the elements consists of three golden stags statant (standing still); this was derived from the coat of arms of Lincoln&#x27;s so-called &quot;second founder&quot;, Thomas Rotherham. It was once claimed that Jesus had stolen the stags from Lincoln, but the counter-argument (from an antiquarian with close Lincoln connections) was that the origins of each were distinct. One suggestion (by Paul Langford, the Rector of Lincoln College) is that Jesus College continued the arms adopted by a theological college founded by Rotherham in his home town – Jesus College, Rotherham – which had been suppressed in the time of Edward VI.

The arms of Maud Green, Lady Parr, mother of Catherine Parr (the last of the six wives of Henry VIII and stepmother to Elizabeth I), were of three stags on an azure background, and this became one of the elements of the arms of Catherine Parr on her marriage. Her sister, Anne Parr, married William, 1st Earl of Pembroke, whose grandson (the 3rd Earl, also called William) became the first Visitor of the college in 1622. Maud Green&#x27;s arms are depicted in plasterwork from about 1592 at Powis Castle, owned by a kinsman of the earls. One writer has suggested that the college may have adopted the arms in order to be associated with one of the leading Welsh families of the day.

This latter theory is not heraldically tenable as the quarters in an achievement after the first and pronominal quarter brought into the family by marriage to heraldic heiresses cannot meaningfully exist on their own to represent the person who now quarters them. It is more probable then that the arms of the college really are those of Archbishop Rotherham and were assumed to be those of the college by John Speed who saw them on one of its buildings in 1605 when preparing his map. Lawrence Hall in Ship Street was given to Rotherham in 1476 and leased to Jesus in 1572. It may well have displayed the Archbishop&#x27;s arms in its structure as did the building on the south side of the front quad of Lincoln which he completed. These arms for Jesus College could not be confused with those of Lincoln as that college, since 1574, already had a complex tripartite coat granted to it by Richard Lee, Portcullis Pursuivant, in which the colour of the stags in the centre section had been changed to Or (gold) and their attitude to statant.

<doc id="128346" wikidata="Q1276338" url="?curid=128346" title="Keble College, Oxford">
<text>Keble College () is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England. Its main buildings are on Parks Road, opposite the University Museum and the University Parks. The college is bordered to the north by Keble Road, to the south by Museum Road, and to the west by Blackhall Road.

Keble was established in 1870, having been built as a monument to John Keble, who had been a leading member of the Oxford Movement which sought to stress the Catholic nature of the Church of England. Consequently, the college&#x27;s original teaching focus was primarily theological, although the college now offers a broad range of subjects, reflecting the diversity of degrees offered across the wider university. In the period after the Second World War, the trends were towards scientific courses (proximity to the university science area east of the University Museum influenced this). As originally constituted, it was for men only and the fellows were mostly bachelors resident in the college. Like many of Oxford&#x27;s men&#x27;s colleges, Keble admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979.

Keble remains distinctive for its once-controversial neo-gothic red-brick buildings designed by William Butterfield. The buildings are also notable for breaking from Oxbridge tradition by arranging rooms along corridors rather than around staircases, in order that the scouts could supervise the comings and goings of visitors (Girton College, Cambridge, similarly breaks this tradition).

Keble is one of the larger colleges of the University of Oxford, with 460 undergraduates and 525 graduate students as of 2022. Keble&#x27;s sister college at the University of Cambridge is Selwyn College.

==History==

The best-known of Keble&#x27;s Victorian founders was Edward Pusey, after whom the Pusey quad and Pusey room are named. The college itself is named after John Keble, one of Pusey&#x27;s colleagues in the Oxford Movement, who died four years before the college&#x27;s foundation in 1870. It was decided immediately after Keble&#x27;s funeral that his memorial would be a new Oxford college bearing his name. The chosen architect was William Butterfield. Two years later, in 1868, the foundation stone was laid by the Archbishop of Canterbury on St Mark&#x27;s Day (25 April, John Keble&#x27;s birthday). The college first opened in 1870, taking in thirty students, whilst the chapel was opened on St Mark&#x27;s Day 1876. Accordingly, the college continues to celebrate St Mark&#x27;s Day each year.

Butterfield produced a notable example of Victorian Gothic architecture, among his few secular buildings, which Pevsner characterised as &quot;actively ugly&quot;, and which, according to Charles Eastlake, defied criticism. The social historian G. M. Trevelyan expressed the then commonly held, and highly dismissive, view: &quot;the monstrosities of architecture erected by order of the dons of Oxford and Cambridge colleges in the days of William Butterfield and Alfred Waterhouse give daily pain to posterity.&quot; Sir Kenneth Clark recalled that during his Oxford years it was generally believed in Oxford not only that Keble College was &quot;the ugliest building in the world&quot; but that its architect was John Ruskin, author of &quot;The Stones of Venice.&quot; The college is built of red, blue, and white bricks; the main structure is of red brick, with white and blue patterned banding. The builders were Parnell &amp; Son of Rugby.
On its construction, Keble was not always admired within the university. Undergraduates at St John&#x27;s College started the &quot;Destroy Keble Society&quot;, which aimed to dismantle the college brick by brick.

An apocryphal story claims that a French visitor, on first sight of the college exclaimed &quot;C&#x27;est magnifique mais ce n&#x27;est pas la gare?&quot; (&quot;It is magnificent but is it not the railway station?&quot;). This is a play on Field Marshal Pierre Bosquet&#x27;s memorable line, referring to the Charge of the Light Brigade, &quot;C&#x27;est magnifique, mais ce n&#x27;est pas la guerre&quot; (&quot;It is magnificent, but it is not war&quot;). This story may have been borrowed from Arthur Wing Pinero&#x27;s identical quip said to have been made at the opening ceremony for the Royal Courts of Justice in London.

Keble is mentioned in John Betjeman&#x27;s poem &quot;Myfanwy at Oxford&quot;, as well as in the writings of John Ruskin and in Monty Python&#x27;s &quot;Travel Agent&quot; sketch. Horace Rumpole, the barrister in John Mortimer&#x27;s books, was a Law graduate of Keble.

In 2005, Keble College featured in the national UK press when its bursar, Roger Boden, was found guilty of racial discrimination by an employment tribunal. An appeal was launched by the college and Boden against the tribunal&#x27;s judgement, resulting in a financial out-of-court settlement with the aggrieved employee.

In Christmas of 2017, a team of alumni from Keble College won the &quot;University Challenge Alumni Christmas Special&quot;, a seasonal programme on BBC2. They beat the University of Reading by 240 points to 0 in the final.

==Buildings==
The main site of Keble contains five quads: Liddon (the largest, named after Henry Parry Liddon), Pusey (named after Edward Bouverie Pusey), Hayward (named after Charles Hayward), De Breyne (named after Andre de Breyne) and Newman (named after John Henry Newman).

===Original buildings===

The best-known portion of Keble&#x27;s buildings is the distinctive main brick complex, designed by Butterfield. The design remained incomplete due to shortage of funds. The Chapel and Hall were built later than the accommodation blocks to the east and west of the two original quadrangles and the warden&#x27;s house at the southeast corner. The Chapel and Hall were both fully funded by William Gibbs and were also designed by Butterfield.

===Modern buildings===
A section west of the chapel was built in a different style in the 1950s with funds from Antonin Besse. Later still further significant additions have been added, most notably the modern, brick Hayward and de Breyne extensions by Ahrends, Burton and Koralek (ABK). The extensions were made possible by a generous response from the businessmen Charles Hayward and André de Breyne and other fund-raising efforts. The ABK buildings included the college&#x27;s memorable, futuristic &quot;goldfish bowl&quot; bar, opened on 3 May 1977 and later refurbished and expanded. In 1995, work was completed on the ARCO building by the US-born architect Rick Mather. This was followed in 2002 by another similarly styled building also designed by Mather, the Sloane Robinson Building. Along with a number of additional student bedrooms the Sloane Robinson Building also provided the college with the O&#x27;Reilly Theatre (a large multipurpose lecture theatre), a dedicated room for musical practice, several seminar rooms and a large open plan space which during term time is used as a café and social space for all members of the college. The original fellows&#x27; garden was lost in the programme of extension, as were a range of houses on Blackhall Road.

The O&#x27;Reilly Theatre is a flexible studio theatre that was completed in 2002.

The seating capacity of the space ranges from 128 to 250, depending on the setup chosen. The standard configuration is end-on, but alternatives include traverse and in-the-round. The theatre is named after Sir Tony O&#x27;Reilly, the billionaire Irish businessman and former international rugby union player, who contributed most of the funds.

====Construction====
The theatre is part of the Sloane Robinson Building development which was designed by Rick Mather Architects from 1996–2002. Theatreplan designed the theatre itself in collaboration with Rick Mather Architects, at a cost of £1.2 million. The project won the following awards:

===H B Allen Centre===

In July 2004 Keble announced the purchase of the former Acland Hospital for £10.75 million. This site, situated a couple of minutes walk from the main college buildings, housed an estimated 100 graduate students. In October 2015 it was confirmed that Keble College had received funding from The H B Allen Charitable Trust to redevelop the Acland Site in order to provide double the number of graduate rooms. This was the largest single donation in the college&#x27;s history. Work on construction of the H B Allen Centre, designed by Rick Mather, began in 2016, with the first graduate students moving in in October 2018. Keble previously owned several houses across Oxford which were used as additional student accommodation, but these were sold following the purchase of the Acland site.

The H B Allen Centre was officially opened by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge on 3 October 2019.

==Student life==

The college publishes a termly magazine called &quot;The Brick&quot; which is sent to Keble alumni to update them on college life. Students used to publish an irreverent spoof version on the last Friday of each term, also named &quot;The Brick&quot;, recording college gossip but this version has not been published since Hilary 2006. The college has since seen the release of a student publication calling itself &quot;The Breezeblock&quot;, containing both college gossip and a satirical take on college life.

Each graduate is given a red brick along with their degree certificates.
Keble were champions of the television quiz show &quot;University Challenge&quot; in 1975 and 1987.

Each year the Advanced Studies Centre invites distinguished speakers for their Creativity Lecture Series. In 2011 the list included Nicholas Humphrey, Tim Ingold and Steve Rayner; in 2012 Robin Dunbar, Kevin Warwick and Margaret Boden were featured.

The Keble Ball is planned by the student committee to coincide with the day-long graduation ceremony in Trinity term week 2, although in 2020 the 150 year commemoration ball was held in week 9 outside of term.

===Sport===
Keble fields several sports teams. Its rugby teams have been successful in winning the intercollegiate league for five seasons in a row and triumphing in the 2007, 2009, 2011, 2015 and 2017 rugby Cuppers, having also been finalists in 2008 and 2010. Keble College Boat Club, the college rowing club compete annually in Torpids and Summer Eights. Keble has also had significant success in football, with the college football team (colloquially known as KCFC) recently completing a historic treble by winning the Men&#x27;s first XI, second XI and Women&#x27;s Cuppers in the same season.

Keble College Sports Ground is located on Woodstock Road, and as well as hosting intercollegiate (&quot;Cuppers&quot;) matches, also lays the stage for annual fixtures between current undergraduates and Old Members (&quot;Ghosts&quot;), particularly in football and cricket. Keble famously won a historic footballing Treble in the 2023/24 season when they won the Men&#x27;s, Men&#x27;s Reserve and Women&#x27;s Football Cuppers. The first ever Football Cuppers Treble. Commemorative photographs of important matches adorn the walls of the Keble Cricket Pavilion inside the ground.

==&quot;The Light of the World&quot;==

Keble owns the original of William Holman Hunt&#x27;s painting &quot;The Light of the World&quot;, which is hung in the side chapel (accessed through the chapel). The picture was completed in 1853 after eight years of work and originally hung in the Royal Academy. It was then given as a gift to the college. Hunt originally wanted the painting to be hung in the main chapel but the architect rejected this idea, as a result, he painted another version of the painting which is in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London. This copy was painted by Hunt when he was nearly 70.

==College stamps==
Keble College has the distinction of being the first college to issue stamps for the prepayment of a porter/messenger delivery service in 1871 only one year after it was founded, and it set the pace for other Oxford colleges to issue their own stamps. This service was successfully challenged by the post office in 1886. Keble also issued a college stamp in 1970 to mark its 100th anniversary.

== Notable conferences at Keble ==

* The Declaration of Clergy on Ritual Conference (January, 1904) 
* The Conference on New Ideals in Education (31 March – 7 April 1923)
* The Oxford Movement Conference (July, 1983)
* The J. R. R. Tolkien Centenary Conference (17–24 August 1992)
* The 12th International Conference on Brain Tumour Research and Therapy (September, 1997)
* The 19th International Radiocarbon Conference (April, 2006)

== In popular culture ==

Keble, under snow, appears as Baidley College in an episode of the television detective show &quot;Endeavour&quot;, with the young Morse investigating the murder of a don.

<doc id="128347" wikidata="Q951946" url="?curid=128347" title="Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford">
<text>Lady Margaret Hall (LMH) is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England, located on a bank of the River Cherwell at Norham Gardens in north Oxford and adjacent to the University Parks. The college is more formally known under its current royal charter as &quot;The Principal and Fellows of the College of the Lady Margaret in the University of Oxford&quot;.

The college was founded in 1878, closely collaborating with Somerville College. Both colleges opened their doors in 1879 as the first two women&#x27;s colleges of Oxford. The college began admitting men in 1979. The college has just under 400 undergraduate students, around 200 postgraduate students and 24 visiting students. In 2016, the college became the only college in Oxford or Cambridge to offer a Foundation Year for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.

In 2018, Lady Margaret Hall ranked 21st out of 30 in Oxford&#x27;s Norrington Table, a measurement of the performance of students in finals.

The college&#x27;s colours are blue, yellow and white. The college uses a coat of arms that accompanies the college&#x27;s motto &quot;Souvent me Souviens&quot;, an Old French phrase meaning &quot;I often remember&quot; or &quot;Think of me often&quot;, the motto of Lady Margaret Beaufort, who founded Christ&#x27;s College and St John&#x27;s College at Cambridge, and after whom the college is named.

The principal, since October 2022, is Stephen Blyth. Notable alumni of Lady Margaret Hall include Benazir Bhutto, Michael Gove, Nigella Lawson, Josie Long, Emma Watson, Ann Widdecombe, Ann Leslie and Malala Yousafzai.

==History==

===Founding===
In June 1878, the &quot;Association for the Higher Education of Women&quot; was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were George Granville Bradley, Master of University College, T. H. Green, a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of Balliol College, and Edward Stuart Talbot, Warden of Keble College. Talbot insisted on a specifically Anglican institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. Some of the Anglican members of the association had specifically wanted to endow an Anglican college after Moncure Conway from the humanist South Place Religious Society in London offered a large sum of money towards a secular women&#x27;s college; the established church was already concerned that University College London, which had recently become the first university to admit women, would lead &quot;advanced women&quot; away from Christianity.

The two parties eventually split, and Talbot&#x27;s group founded Lady Margaret Hall, while T. H. Green founded Somerville College. Lady Margaret Hall opened its doors to its first nine students in 1879. The first 21 students from Somerville and Lady Margaret Hall attended lectures in rooms above a baker&#x27;s shop on Little Clarendon Street. Despite the college&#x27;s High Anglican origins, not all students were devout Christians.

The college was named after Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of King Henry VII, patron of scholarship and learning. The first principal was Elizabeth Wordsworth, the great-niece of the poet William Wordsworth and daughter of Christopher Wordsworth, Bishop of Lincoln.

===Growth and development===
With a new building opening in 1894, the college expanded to 25 students.

The land on which the college is built was formerly part of the manor of Norham that belonged to St John&#x27;s College. The college bought the land from St John&#x27;s in 1894, the other institution driving a hard bargain and requiring a development price not only on the practical building land but also on the undevelopable water meadows. However, this land purchase marked a change in ambition from occupying residential buildings for teaching purposes to erecting buildings befitting an educational institution.

In 1897, members of Lady Margaret Hall founded the Lady Margaret Hall Settlement, as part of the settlement movement. It was a charitable initiative, originally a place for graduates from the college to live in North Lambeth where they would work with and help develop opportunities for the poor. Members of the college also helped found the Women&#x27;s University Settlement, which continues to operate to this day, as the Blackfriars Settlement in south London.

Before 1920, the university refused to give academic degrees to women and would not acknowledge them as full members of the university. (Some of these women, nicknamed the steamboat ladies, were awarded &quot;ad eundem&quot; degrees by Trinity College Dublin, between 1904 and 1907.) In 1920 the first women graduated from the college at the Sheldonian Theatre and the principal at the time, Henrietta Jex-Blake, was given an honorary degree.

During the Second World War women were not permitted to fight on the front line, and thus many of the students and fellows took up other roles to aid in the war effort, becoming nurses, firefighters and ambulance drivers. The Fellows&#x27; Lawn was dug up and the students grew vegetables as part of the Dig for Victory campaign.

In 1979, one hundred years after its foundation, the college began admitting men as well as women; it was the first of the women&#x27;s colleges to do so, along with St. Anne&#x27;s.

===Members of the college===
In 1919, J. R. R. Tolkien started to give private tuition to students at Oxford, including members of LMH, where his tuition was much needed given the college&#x27;s limited resources and tutors in its early years. Later his daughter, Priscilla Reuel Tolkien, attended the college, graduating in 1951.

In 1948, Harper Lee, the future author of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, was a visiting student at LMH.

In 2017, Malala Yousafzai, the youngest-ever Nobel Prize Peace laureate and Pakistani campaigner for girls&#x27; education, became a student of the college; she described the interview as &quot;the hardest interview of [her] life&quot;, and received an offer of AAA in her A-Levels. She graduated in 2020. Also in 2017, prospective Chemistry student Brian White faced deportation at the hands of the Home Office, but was able to take up his place at the college.

==Foundation year==
Lady Margaret Hall is the only Oxford college to offer a foundation year; the scheme recruits students from minority and underrepresented backgrounds, and offers successful applicants lower grade requirements than the standard Oxford entry grades. Students choose a subject to specialise in, and also take courses in study skills and other general subject areas, with the aim that they progress to an undergraduate degree at the college after a year of study. Pupils live in the college and have access to the same university facilities, both academic and social, as other students.

Modelled after a programme at Trinity College, Dublin, the four-year pilot scheme began in 2016 with 10 students, seven of whom went on to study at Oxford, with the other three receiving offers from different Russell Group universities. It was praised by David Lammy, a Labour MP who said the foundation year is &quot;exactly the sort of thing that needs to be done&quot;, and by Les Ebdon, director of Office for Fair Access, who described the programme as &quot;innovative and important&quot;.

==Buildings and grounds==

The development of the college&#x27;s buildings is perhaps best thought of as a zigzag, beginning in the 1870s at the end of Norham Gardens and making its way down towards the River Cherwell, and then running back towards Norham Gardens forming quadrangles on the return journey. The following account of the buildings moves through the college as these spaces emerge for a visitor entering the college at the Porters&#x27; Lodge and walking to the river. Because of the way the college developed, the dates and styles of the buildings enclosing the quadrangles are not all of a piece.

===Laetare Quadrangle===
The Laetare quadrangle was completed in March 2017 and includes both the college&#x27;s newest and oldest buildings. The main entrance consists of the front gates flanked by classical columns along with the Porters&#x27; Lodge (2017). Unlike most other Oxford colleges, the Porter&#x27;s Lodge is freely accessible 24/7 to visitors and members of the public even during term time, and visitors are not charged for entry. It is also wheelchair accessible, and is participating in the Safe Lodge Scheme, in which students from other participating colleges who feel vulnerable or unsafe can go there and receive free transportation back to their own college, which is later charged to their student account. On the North West side the Donald Fothergill Building (2017) contains student accommodation while the Clore Graduate Centre (2017) extends further out to the South East towards the University Parks.

The college&#x27;s oldest buildings are along the southeast side of the Laetare Quadrangle. The college&#x27;s original house, a white brick gothic villa, is now known as &quot;Old Old Hall&quot;, while the adjoining red-brick extension designed by Basil Champneys is known as New Old Hall (1884). Old Old Hall originally housed the college chapel until the construction of the Deneke Building. Opposite the entrance is the Wolfson West (1964), which was previously the entrance to the college.

Old Old Hall, which had been built as a speculative development on land leased from St John&#x27;s College, was described as an &quot;ugly little white villa&quot; by the college&#x27;s founder, Bishop Talbot in his 1923 history of the college. On several occasions in the 20th century, consideration was given to demolishing the earliest buildings of the college, but the temptation was resisted.

The only remaining visible evidence of the road that used to run alongside Old Old Hall and past the steps of Talbot Hall are the two large linden trees, which used to line the pavement before the road was removed to allow expansion of the college. The two smaller trees were planted during construction of the quadrangle. The recent expansion designed by John Simpson Architects was modelled after the Porta Maggiore in Rome, in conjunction with the simple façade of the Wolfson West building.

The MCR, located in the Clore Graduate Centre, is named after the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto, who studied at the college from 1973 to 1977.

===Wolfson Quadrangle===

The architect of the main early college buildings, including Lodge, Talbot and Wordsworth, was Sir Reginald Blomfield, who had earlier worked on other educational commissions such as Shrewsbury School, and Exeter College, Oxford. He used the French Renaissance style of the 17th century for the buildings and chose red brick with white stone facings, setting a tone the college was to continue to follow in later work.
These buildings describe the south and east of the Wolfson Quadrangle and run out into the gardens to the east. Blomfield was also involved in establishing and planning the gardens.

The central block, the Talbot Building (1910) on the North East of the main quad houses Talbot Hall and the Old Library (currently a reception and lecture room), while the accommodation for students and tutors is divided between three wings, the Wordsworth Building (1896), the Toynbee Building (1915) and the Lodge Building (1926).

Talbot Hall contains some fine oak panelling donated by former students to honour Elizabeth Wordsworth and, prior to the Deneke Building, was used as a dining hall for the students. In recent years, it is used to house termly live music nights among other college events. The portraits in the Hall include the work of notable artists; among the portraits of principals are:
* Sir J. J. Shannon&#x27;s portrait of Dame Elizabeth
* Philip de László&#x27;s of Miss Jex-Blake
* Sir Rodrigo Moynihan&#x27;s of Dr Grier
* Maud Sumner&#x27;s of Miss Sutherland
In the old Library is a marble statue by Edith Bateson.

On the North West is the Lynda Grier building (1962) housing the college library; this was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1961. The ground floor of Lynda Grier was originally student accommodation but in 2006 it was converted into a law library, which was opened that year by Cherie Blair. The library was of great importance when founded as women were not permitted to use the Bodleian Library, and thus is relatively large for an Oxford college. Since 2016 the library has also featured a feminist book collection curated by Associate Fellow Emma Watson, called &quot;Our Shared Shelf&quot;. This collection supports a feminist book club that runs at the college. The Briggs room originally contained the entire archive of rare and antiquarian books donated to the college over the years. However, due to its size of around 2,000 books, the archive is now stored in the Lawrence Lacerte Rare Books Room in the new Law Library extension on the ground floor. The collection includes a Quran created and a Latin translation of Galileo&#x27;s &quot;Dialogo&quot; from 1663.

Lynda Grier and Wolfson West were designed by Raymond Erith. In recent years the Wolfson Quadrangle, in contrast to many Oxbridge quadrangles, has been planted with wildflowers instead of an intensively managed, striped quadrangle lawn.

===Lannon Quadrangle===
Named after former principal, Dame Frances Lannon, the quadrangle consists of the Sutherland Building (1971) and the Pipe Partridge Building (2010). Behind this is Sutherland&#x27;s sister building, Kathleen Lee (1972), which houses the JCR.

The first phase of the recent plan to expand the college, the Pipe Partridge Building, was completed in early 2010 and was opened by the Chancellor of the University of Oxford, Lord Patten of Barnes, in April 2010.

The Pipe Partridge Building includes the 136-seat Simpkins Lee Theatre, a dining hall, seminar rooms and 64 new undergraduate study bedrooms.

It won the Georgian Group award for the best new building in the classical tradition.

===Chapel and Deneke===

To the northeast extends the large Deneke Building (1932) along with the hall and the college&#x27;s Byzantine-style chapel where the choir practises and carol services are held in Michaelmas term. These were designed by Giles Gilbert Scott. The dining hall has a reputation for serving the best meals of any Oxford college, and is one of only a few Oxford colleges to serve Halal meals. The chapel has simple decoration with several paintings on the walls, and a statue of Margaret Beaufort that lies in the central section of the chapel. The passageway that leads to the chapel is referred to within the college as &quot;Hell&#x27;s Passage&quot;. The name was derived from the 19th-century illustrations of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, by John D. Batten, that used to decorate its walls.

The chapel is in the form of a Greek cross and was dedicated by the college&#x27;s founder Edward Stuart Talbot, in January 1933.

In the autumn of 2019, Andrew Foreshew-Cain became Chaplain.
In April 2019, he and other LGBT clergy in the Church of England started the &quot;Campaign for Equal Marriage in the Church of England&quot;, calling on the church to allow same-sex couples to be married in Church of England parishes and to stop discriminating against people in such marriages.

===Gardens and grounds===
Lady Margaret Hall is one of the few Oxford colleges that backs onto the River Cherwell. It is set in spacious grounds (about ). The grounds include a set of playing fields, netball and tennis courts, a punt house, topiary, and large herbaceous planting schemes along with vegetable borders. There is a Fellows&#x27; Garden – hidden from view by tall hedgerows – and a Fellows&#x27; Lawn, on which walking is forbidden.

==Student life==
The Junior Common Room (JCR) is a physical room as well as being the association of the undergraduate members of the college. It represents its members to the college authorities and facilitates activities and budgets as well as clubs and societies. Officers are elected by the student body to communicate internally and externally on matters regarding student life.
Graduate students have similar support from that provided for the JCR in the Middle Common Room (MCR).

In 2022, Lady Margaret Hall was the first Oxford college to sign a government-backed pledge on ending non-disclosure agreements in cases of sexual misconduct. This followed reporting by &quot;The Times&quot; that eight female LMH students felt unsafe after the college&#x27;s response to their complaints of student sexual violence between 2015 and 2021. One undergraduate said that she was threatened with expulsion if she spoke about being raped by a man who was previously reported to the college for sexual violence, and was made to sign a confidentiality agreement by the then Principal Alan Rusbridger. The college initially disputed the undergraduate&#x27;s claim, but under Rusbridger&#x27;s successor Christine Gerrard settled the case and paid damages to the woman. Gerrard described the pledge as part of reforms to strengthen safeguarding procedures.

===Accommodation===

Accommodation is always provided for undergraduates for three years of their study, and provided for some graduates. The accommodation is found throughout college with a ballot system giving the first choice of room to the students of higher years. The Deneke Building exclusively contains accommodation for first-year undergraduates and students visiting from other universities. However, the first College Disparities Report created by Oxford&#x27;s Student Union ranked the college as one of the poorest Oxford colleges in terms of asset wealth, with one of the listed consequences of these disparities being that undergraduate students will pay an average of £5,000 more in rent during the course of their studies than those at wealthier colleges.

===Boating===
Given the River Cherwell running past the bottom of LMH&#x27;s grounds, the students have always had a strong history of spending time by or on the river with the first boat, &quot;Lady Maggie&quot;, purchased in 1885. The punt house, by tradition, opens on May Day.

===Sports===

In addition to university-wide societies, students at Lady Margaret Hall can also join societies specific to the college. The college has a gym, found near the entrance by Pipe Partridge.

====Rowing====
LMH&#x27;s rowing club, Lady Margaret Hall Boat Club (LMHBC) is one of the largest sports clubs within the college. In recent years, the club has won blades in OURCs events multiple times. The club has a boat house shared with Trinity College on Boat House Island by Christ Church Meadows, along with a purpose-built erg shed, constructed to aid in training.
The Men&#x27;s 1st VIII have raced in the Temple Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta on several occasions. On multiple years including 2018 and 2019, members of the club have rowed in The Boat Race, an annual competition between Oxford and Cambridge.

Like other UK rowing clubs, the college&#x27;s boat club has distinctive blazers that can be awarded by the club to members who attain membership of certain VIIIs or race with distinction in Summer Eights or Torpids. These blazers have blue and yellow trim and a blue Beaufort portcullis on them, which is the emblem of the boat club and increasingly of other sports clubs.

Rowing blades commemorating success in the intercollegiate rowing competitions decorate the walls of the bar.
====Football====
The college football ground is situated adjacent to Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies and is shared with St Catherine&#x27;s College and Trinity College.
==Art collection==
In light of its history, the hall has a collection of portraits of early/distinguished women academics. Early Principals Lynda Grier, Dame Lucy Sutherland and Sally Chilver, along with other members of the college, were keen collectors of contemporary art and bequeathed many of these works to the college.

A Fellow in Fine Art, Elizabeth Price, was shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 2012.

The college&#x27;s art collection includes works by:

* Maggi Hambling
* John Singer Sargent
* Sir Stanley Spencer
* Philip de László

==Coat of arms==
The college&#x27;s coat of arms features devices that recall those associated with its foundation:

* The portcullis is from the arms of Lady Margaret Beaufort
* The bell is a symbol of the Wordsworth family.
* The talbot dogs represent Edward Talbot.

The original coat of arms consisted of three daisies intertwined and bore the motto &quot;Ex solo ad solem&quot;, meaning &quot;From the earth to the sun&quot;, and can be seen to adorn Talbot Hall, and the Wordsworth and Toynbee buildings. The previous coat of arms gave its name to one of the early college student publications from the 1890s – &quot;The Daisy&quot;.

After the 50th anniversary of the college, the coat of arms was replaced, now encompassing features that represent the history and founding of the college. 
==Deneke talks==
In the 20th century, the yearly Deneke talks were held in memory of Philip Maurice Deneke who died in 1924. Lectures in this series included &quot;Goethe on nature and science&quot; in 1942 by Nobel laureate Charles Scott Sherrington, and in 1933, Albert Einstein gave the talk &quot;Einiges zur atomistic&quot;, concluding the address as follows: &quot;The deeper we search, the more we find there is to know, and as long as humanity exists I believe it will always be so.&quot; Margaret Deneke, daughter of Philip Deneke, wrote of the talk in her memoirs:

==Culture and traditions==

===Literature===
In Phillip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Commonwealth&quot;, the character Lyra Belacqua attends an Oxford college, St Sophia&#x27;s, which bears many similarities to Lady Margaret Hall: from its location on the map seen in &quot;Lyra&#x27;s Oxford&quot; to being one of the first colleges to offer women an education.

A thinly disguised version of the college appeared as &quot;Lady Matilda&#x27;s College&quot; in an episode of &quot;Lewis;&quot; portions of the episode were filmed within the hall.

The grounds, along with those of Trinity College, Oxford, were the basis for Fleet College in the American author Charles Finch&#x27;s novel set in Oxford University, &quot;The Last Enchantments&quot;.

&quot;Death on the Cherwell&quot; by Mavis Doriel Hay includes a St Simeon&#x27;s College, located approximately on the site of Lady Margaret Hall.

&quot;Fire and Hemlock&quot; by Diana Wynne Jones had a St Margaret&#x27;s College, which is based on Lady Margaret Hall.

The fictional St Scholastika&#x27;s College in Val McDermid&#x27;s 2010 novel &quot;Trick of the Dark&quot; is a formerly all-female college located in North Oxford, adjacent to the University Parks, with grounds backing onto the river, and buildings of red and yellow brick; it thus appears to be inspired as much by Lady Margaret Hall as by McDermid&#x27;s own alma mater, St. Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford.

===Royal visits===
Queen Elizabeth II visited the hall in 1961.

Charles, Prince of Wales visited the college in 2006.

Anne, Princess Royal visited the college in 2014.

===Steam locomotive===
A Great Western Railway 6959 Class locomotive named &quot;Lady Margaret Hall&quot;, number 7911, was built in 1950. It was one of the &quot;Modified Hall&quot; class and it was in service in the South East until December 1963.

===Gardens===
Unusually for Oxford colleges, students are permitted to walk on the Talbot Quadrangle, the main quad of the college. In Trinity term, a spiral of wildflowers are planted, creating a grass walkway into the centre of the quad. This is the only wildflower quad in Oxford. There is a circular wooden bench dedicated to Iris Murdoch in the college gardens where she used to go walking.

===Formal Hall===
The college&#x27;s candlelit Formal Hall is held every Friday of term.

Lady Margaret Hall is one of nine Oxford colleges to use the &quot;two-word&quot; Latin grace; this grace is also used by five colleges at the University of Cambridge. The person presiding at High Table says the grace in two parts at formal meals. The first half of the grace, the &quot;ante cibum&quot;, is said before the meal starts and the second, the &quot;post cibum&quot;, once the meal&#x27;s conclusion. It is as follows:

&quot;Benedictus benedicat&quot; – &quot;May the Blessed One give a blessing&quot;

&quot;Benedicto benedicatur&quot; – &quot;Let praise be given to the Blessed One&quot; or &quot;Let a blessing be given by the Blessed One&quot;

In contrast to some other colleges, gowns are not worn to formal hall, though they are still required at special occasions such as the Scholars&#x27; dinner and the Founders&#x27; and Benefactors&#x27; dinner.

===Poet in Residence===
The college has a poet in residence.

===Chapel===
The chapel at LMH holds weekly evensong every Friday, with services led by Andrew Foreshew-Cain, as well as Catholic communions and other seasonal services such as the Christmas carol service and the Ash Wednesday service. The LMH Chapel Choir is led by Paul Burke.

<doc id="128348" wikidata="Q653483" url="?curid=128348" title="Linacre College, Oxford">
<text>Linacre College is a constituent college of the University of Oxford in the UK whose members comprise approximately 50 fellows and 550 postgraduate students.

Linacre is a diverse college in terms of both the international composition of its members (the majority of whom are from outside the UK and have come from over 133 countries), as well as the disciplines studied. Linacre was the first graduate college in the UK for both sexes and all subjects. Unlike most colleges, students and fellows share the same common room and there is no high table.

The college was founded in 1962 and is named after Thomas Linacre (1460–1524), founder of the Royal College of Physicians as well as a distinguished renaissance humanist — multidisciplinary interests that the college aims to reflect.

The college is located on St Cross Road at its junction with South Parks Road, bordering University Parks to the north and the University Science Area to the west.

==History==

Linacre College (called Linacre House for its first three years) was the UK&#x27;s first graduate society for both sexes and all subjects. 
Founding Principal John Bamborough described it as &quot;a deliberate experiment by the University to see whether the needs of graduate students could be met by a new type of society.&quot;

It was founded on 1 August 1962, in premises on St Aldate&#x27;s formerly occupied by St Catherine&#x27;s Society (now St Catherine&#x27;s College) and currently home to the university&#x27;s Music Department. Initially there were 115 members of whom only 30 were British. The first senior members included Isaiah Berlin, Dorothy Hodgkin and John Hicks.

In November 1964, Linacre became a self-governing society and then on 1 August 1986 an independent college of Oxford University by royal charter. In 1977, Linacre moved to its present site at Cherwell Edge, a Queen Anne building designed in part by Basil Champneys, which was formerly a private home, a convent of the Society of the Holy Child Jesus, and a residence for students of other colleges. Since 2010, the principal has been Nick Brown.

=== Proposed renaming ===

On 31 October 2021, the college signed a memorandum of understanding with SOVICO Group, represented by their chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao to receive a donation of £155 million. The MoU sets out the intention to create a new graduate centre and endow graduate access scholarships. After receipt of the first £50 million, the College would approach the Privy Council to ask for permission to change the name from Linacre College to Thao College. The donation and proposed name change has been a source of controversy for some university staff and students due to SOVICO&#x27;s interests in fossil fuel industries.

In June 2022, UK Secretary of State for Education Michelle Donelan announced that there would be a formal investigation into the memorandum of understanding between the College and SOVICO group, due to concerns raised in the House of Commons.

== Coat of arms and motto ==
In 1988 Linacre College was granted a coat of arms blazoned:
: &quot;Sable an open Book proper edged Or bound Gules the dexter page charged with the Greek Letter Alpha the sinister page charged with the Greek Letter Omega both Sable the whole between three Escallops Argent&quot;.

The college motto beneath the escutcheon is &quot;No End To Learning&quot;. College colours are grey, yellow and black (or silver, gold and sable) but only the latter two colours are used for rowing blades and most sports clothing.

=== College Grace ===
The College Grace is said in Latin by the Principal (or a designated Fellow) at formal dinners in Hall.
Before commencement of the meal the words &quot;&quot;Benedictus benedicat&quot; (&#x27;May the Blessed One give a blessing&#x27;) are said, all standing. 
After the completion of the meal the words &quot;Benedicto benedicatur&quot;&quot; (&#x27;May the Blessed One be blessed&#x27;) are said, all standing.

==Buildings and facilities==

Linacre&#x27;s main site is on the corner of South Parks Road and St Cross Road. In addition to the original building of 1886 (now known as the OC Tanner Building) there are three much newer accommodation blocks on the main site, all built of &quot;Linacre College Special Blend Brick&quot; with matching Queen Anne style architecture. The Bamborough, Abraham, and Griffiths buildings were completed in 1986, 1995, and 2008 respectively, raising the total number of student rooms on the main college site to 92.

=== OC Tanner Building ===

The oldest part of the college, known as the OC Tanner Building, contains most of the central facilities, all staff offices and some student accommodation. The heart of the building is the large common room, which has a bar and other leisure facilities. The college library, formerly a chapel, includes shared computing facilities for college members.

==== Gilbert Ryle Collection ====
As well as the main library there is also Gilbert Ryle&#x27;s personal library, part of which he donated in 1968, and the remainder after his death in 1976. Ryle was involved in the creation of Linacre House in 1962, when the institution had no library. When Ryle retired in 1968, he donated many of his books to Linacre College, and the remainder of the collection after he died in 1976. The books are stored in the Linacre Bookcase and are available for use in the Linacre Library.

=== Bamborough Building ===
The first major addition to the main college site was the Bamborough Building, which opened in 1985 and was officially named in 1986. It is located beside the OC Tanner Building to form a quad featuring an ornamental fountain. A plaque on the Bamborough Building commemorates it winning an Oxford Preservation Trust award in 1987.

=== Abraham Building ===
The Edward &amp; Asbjörg Abraham Building, completed in 1995, is primarily a residential building offering single bedrooms for students. It was designed and built as part of a movement within Linacre to raise environmental awareness and promote sustainable development. The building was named UK Green Building of the Year 1996 and won the BCE Environmental Leadership Award as well as the Oxfordshire special conservation award of 1995. A photovoltaic system was installed on the roofs of Abraham and Griffiths Buildings in 2011. The quad enclosed by the Tanner, Abraham and Griffiths buildings was named in 2012 after Jaki Leverson a former student, and contains a sculpture entitled &#x27;The Dancing Phoenix&#x27; by Hugo Powell.

The basement of the Abraham Building houses a music practice room and the college gym, which has four ergometers, a good range of weights, various other gym equipment and space for several classes.

=== Griffiths Building ===
The newest residence on the main site is the Griffiths Building, named after former student and Honorary Fellow Rodney Griffiths. Completed in 2008, the building has 28 en suite single rooms and 4 en suite double rooms with shared kitchens. It was a finalist for two awards of The Brick Development Association.

=== Dining hall ===
Between the OC Tanner and Abraham Buildings is Linacre&#x27;s large dining hall, added in 1977, which operates a canteen service most weekdays for lunch and evening meal.

=== The Rom Harré Garden ===
The most recent major development at Linacre has been the completion of a garden extension on the main site of the college in 2010. This is a quiet spot with flowers and outdoor seating. Rom Harré is a former Vice-Principal and Emeritus Fellow.

=== Off site accommodation ===
Linacre also owns or leases a number of buildings off the main site, including properties on Banbury Road, Bradmore Road, Divinity Road, Iffley Road, Stanley Road and Walton Street, which provide a further 102 rooms (including rooms for couples). The college generally offers accommodation to all first-year students (freshers) and the percentage of graduate students housed within college accommodation exceeds the university average. Students typically move into private shared housing in and around Oxford after their first year.

==Student life==

=== Common Room ===
Much of the college&#x27;s social and sporting life is coordinated through the Common Room, of which all students, fellows and staff are members. The Common Room&#x27;s elected executive committee oversees activities and works closely with college officials to represent its members&#x27; interests.

The Common Room organises numerous events during term time. Particular highlights include termly bops, which are among the largest student-run parties in Oxford. Operating across two floors and outside areas, the bops are themed parties open to members of other colleges. The biggest bop of the year is usually the matriculation bop (&quot;sexy sub-fusc” theme) which usually attracts a queue far in excess of the 450 person capacity. In 2015, 750 people enjoyed the event at any given time, and more than 950 people attended it throughout the night. Other social events include smaller college parties, movie nights, cake baking, cheese and wine tasting and lectures.

=== Clubs and societies ===
Like all colleges, Linacre has many active sports teams and its members also represent the university in various sports. Active societies and clubs include the Linacre Music Society, Linacre College Boat Club, Linacre Recreational Football Society, Linacre Ladies that Lift weightlifting society, Linacre Yoga Society, Linacre Green Society, and Linacre Intercultural Society and Linacre Photo Society, among others.

===Sustainability and ethics===
The college has a strong environmental ethos and has gained a reputation as the &#x27;green&#x27; college of Oxford through a number of environmental initiatives over the years including an official sustainability policy. Linacre has been ranked greenest college by OUSU in a number of years. The common room executive hosts an environment officer and there is an active green society since 2007 as well as an allotment society. Linacre&#x27;s Abraham building won Green Building of the Year 1996 and as well as the BCE Environmental Leadership Award. In 2006 Linacre became the first carbon neutral college in Oxford by offsetting carbon emissions with a three-year contract with ClimateCare but stopped being carbon neutral in 2008.

In 2010 Linacre committed to the 10:10 campaign to reduce carbon emissions 10% that year. It has more recently set a target of 40% reduction over ten years until 2020. A photovoltaic system was installed on the roofs of Abraham and Griffiths Buildings in 2011. In 2016 Linacre invested £100,000 into the Low Carbon Hub, a renewable energy social enterprise. Linacre was the first Oxford college to achieve fairtrade status in September 2006. In 2016 Linacre also hosted a seminar series on the sustainability and ethics of banking.

Linacre runs two major public lectures each year:

====Linacre Lectures on the Environment====

<text>Mansfield College, Oxford is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in Oxford, England. The college was founded in Birmingham in 1838 as a college for Nonconformist students. It moved to Oxford in 1886 and was renamed Mansfield College after George Mansfield and his sister Elizabeth. In 1995 a royal charter was awarded giving the institution full college status. The college grounds are located on Mansfield Road, near the centre of Oxford.

As of December 2023, the college comprises approximately 245 undergraduates, 145 graduates and 40 visiting students. There are around 40 fellows.

Helen Mountfield, a barrister and legal scholar, has been the principal of the college since 2018.

== History ==
The college was founded in 1838, under the patronage of George Storer Mansfield (1764–1837) and his two sisters Sarah (1767–1853) and Elizabeth (1772–1847), as Spring Hill College, Birmingham, a college for Nonconformist students. In the nineteenth century, although students from all religious denominations were legally entitled to attend universities, they were forbidden by statute from taking degrees unless they conformed to the Church of England.
In 1871, the Universities Tests Act abolished all religious tests for non-theological degrees at Oxford, Cambridge and Durham Universities. For the first time the educational and social opportunities offered by Britain&#x27;s premier institutions were open to some Nonconformists. The Prime Minister who enacted these reforms, William Ewart Gladstone, encouraged the creation of a Nonconformist college at Oxford.

Spring Hill College moved to Oxford in 1886 and was renamed Mansfield College after George Mansfield and his sister Elizabeth. The Victorian buildings, designed by Basil Champneys on a site bought from Merton College, were formally opened in October 1889.

Mansfield was the first Nonconformist college to open in Oxford. Initially the college accepted men only, the first woman (Constance Coltman) being admitted to read for an external degree in 1913.

During World War II, over forty members of staff from the Government Code &amp; Cypher School moved to the college to work on British codes and cyphers.

Like many of Oxford&#x27;s colleges, Mansfield admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979, having previously not accepted women to read for Oxford degrees.

In 1955 the college was granted the status of permanent private hall within the University of Oxford and in 1995 a royal charter was awarded giving the institution full college status.

=== Nonconformist roots ===
Since the college was first formally integrated into the university structure in 1955, its Nonconformist aspects have gradually diminished. Until 2007 Mansfield trained United Reformed Church (URC) ordinands, who became fully matriculated members of the university and received degrees.

The Nonconformist history of the college is however still apparent in a few of its features. A portrait of Oliver Cromwell hangs in the Senior Common Room and portraits of the dissenters of 1662 hang in the library and the corridors of the main college building, together with portraits of Viscount Saye and Sele, John Hampden, Thomas Jollie and Hugh Peters.
The college chapel is unconsecrated, and contains stained glass windows and statues depicting leading figures from Nonconformist movements, including Cromwell, Sir Henry Vane and William Penn. Chapel services are still conducted in a Nonconformist tradition. Over the years attendance at chapel services has declined and the make-up of the general student body no longer reflects the Nonconformist religious origins of the college.

== Grounds ==

The grounds of Mansfield College are located on Mansfield Road, near the centre of Oxford, and to the south of the Science Area. The grounds are near the University Parks and the River Cherwell. The college shares a boundary wall with Wadham College.

=== Buildings ===
The main building was designed by architect Basil Champneys, and built between 1887 and 1889. It houses the main college library, the law library and the theology library. It is also home to the college&#x27;s Junior Common Room, Middle Common Room, and Senior Common Room. The main college building encloses three sides of the large quadrangle, which has a circular lawn. The college also has several other buildings, primarily used for student accommodation, which are opposite the main building.
Unusually, Mansfield College is not accessed via the porter&#x27;s lodge, the college staff maintaining that this is representative of its open and non-conformist ethos. However, early outlines of schematics for the college show an enclosed second quadrangle behind the main building, with the front tower serving as a gatehouse into this area. However, the college&#x27;s constituent poverty and lack of funds owing to its non-conformist history prevented these plans from being executed. What was planned to be a traditional style porter&#x27;s lodge can still be found in the main building: on 1902 plans, the tiny room opening directly on to the entrance hall is labelled &#x27;Porter&#x27;.

The latest addition to the college&#x27;s facilities, the Hands Building, was designed by Rick Mather Architects and uses renewable energy sources. It incorporates 74 en-suite study bedrooms, seminar rooms and a 160-seat auditorium that will be used for lectures, as a cinema, moot court and performing arts space. It was nominated for the Royal Institute of British Architects South Regional Awards 2019.

== Academic performance ==
The Norrington Table is an annual ranking of the colleges of the University of Oxford by number and class of degrees awarded. In 2019 Mansfield ranked 5th out of 30 Colleges in the table. The university advises that due to the small number of degrees awarded the rankings should be treated with caution. Mansfield&#x27;s academic performance, as reflected in the Norrington Table, is currently within the same 10% range as most of the other colleges.

== Student life ==
Mansfield College Boat Club and a number of other college organisations are popular amongst the students, achieving results competitive with the larger colleges. Many of the sports teams are &quot;combined&quot; in partnership with Merton College.

In Oxford tradition, Mansfield College holds regular formal dinners. These take place every Wednesday and Friday in the Chapel Hall.

Mansfield is known for placing emphasis on access, welfare and equality, with over 90% of students coming from a state school background. The college is recognized as a University College of Sanctuary by the UK charity City of Sanctuary, and has launched a fully-funded Sanctuary Scholarship.

== College grace ==
In 2011, Mansfield College adopted two distinct pre-supper graces, one religious and one non-religious, in an effort to be inclusive to persons of different faiths, or none.
Prior to 2011, the college used the following, specifically Christian grace, adopted in 1953:
Translated: &quot;Almighty God, Father of mercies and fount of every good, in the enjoyment of thy gifts we bless thy name, through Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot;

<text>Brogden is a census-designated place (CDP) in Wayne County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 2,510 in 2020. It is included in the Goldsboro, North Carolina Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The community takes its name from the Brogden family, Quakers of English descent who settled in the area during the colonial period.

Shiloh Primitive Baptist Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

Brogden is the birthplace of Ava Gardner. 

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (1.82%) is water.

Brogden&#x27;s elevations are on average 175 feet above sea level. The area is underlain by unconsolidated beds of sand, clay and gravel. Most of these beds were deposited in seawater as the sea advanced and retreated during the geologic development of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. To a much lesser extent, streams deposited layers of sediment which mixed with that deposited on the sea floor.

The climate in Brogden is characterized by warm summers and moderate winters. The average temperature is about 62 degrees. Annual precipitation is about 50 inches of rainfall per year, with the major portion occurring in the late spring and summer.

Brogden also is the name of a farming community in neighboring Johnston County where Hollywood actress Ava Gardner lived as a child.

<doc id="128351" wikidata="Q82513" url="?curid=128351" title="Merton College, Oxford">
<text>Merton College (in full: The House or College of Scholars of Merton in the University of Oxford) is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England. Its foundation can be traced back to the 1260s when Walter de Merton, chancellor to Henry III and later to Edward I, first drew up statutes for an independent academic community and established endowments to support it. An important feature of de Merton&#x27;s foundation was that this &quot;college&quot; was to be self-governing and the endowments were directly vested in the Warden and Fellows.

By 1274, when Walter retired from royal service and made his final revisions to the college statutes, the community was consolidated at its present site in the south east corner of the city of Oxford, and a rapid programme of building commenced. The hall and the chapel and the rest of the front quad were complete before the end of the 13th century. Mob Quad, one of Merton&#x27;s quadrangles, was constructed between 1288 and 1378, and is claimed to be the oldest quadrangle in Oxford, while Merton College Library, located in Mob Quad and dating from 1373, is the oldest continuously functioning library for university academics and students in the world.

Like many of Oxford&#x27;s colleges, Merton admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979, after over seven centuries as an institution for men only. Merton&#x27;s second female warden, Irene Tracey, was appointed as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford in 2022, and Professor Jennifer Payne was subsequently elected as acting warden in 2022 and as warden in 2023.

Alumni and academics past and present include five Nobel laureates, the writer J. R. R. Tolkien, who was Merton Professor of English Language and Literature from 1945 to 1959, and Liz Truss, who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in September and October 2022. Merton is one of the wealthiest colleges in Oxford and held funds totalling £298 million as of July 2020.

==History==
===Foundation and origins===

Merton College was founded in 1264 by Walter de Merton, Lord Chancellor and Bishop of Rochester. It has a claim to be the oldest college in Oxford, a claim which is disputed between Merton College, Balliol College and University College. One argument for Merton&#x27;s claim is that it was the first college to be provided with &quot;statutes&quot;, a constitution governing the college set out at its founding. Merton&#x27;s statutes date back to 1264, whereas neither Balliol nor University College had statutes until the 1280s.
Merton has an unbroken line of wardens dating back to 1264. Of these, many had great influence over the development of the college. Henry Savile was one notable leader who led the college to flourish in the early 17th century by extending its buildings and recruiting new fellows.

In 1333, masters from Merton were among those who left Oxford in an attempt to found a new university at Stamford. The leader of the rebels was reported to be one William de Barnby, a Yorkshireman who had been fellow and bursar of Merton College.

===St Alban Hall===

St Alban Hall was an independent academic hall owned by the convent of Littlemore until it was purchased by Merton College in 1548 following the dissolution of the convent. It continued as a separate institution until it was finally annexed by the college in 1881, on the resignation of its last principal, William Charles Salter.

===Parliamentarian sympathies in the Civil War===
During the English Civil War, Merton was the only Oxford college to side with Parliament. This was due to an earlier dispute between the Warden, Nathaniel Brent, and the Visitor of Merton and Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud. Brent had been Vicar-General to Laud, who had held a visitation of Merton College in 1638, and insisted on many radical reforms: his letters to Brent were couched in haughty and decisive language.

Brent, a parliamentarian, moved to London at the start of the Civil War: the college&#x27;s buildings were commandeered by the Royalists and used to house much of Charles I&#x27;s court when Oxford was the Royalists&#x27; capital. This included the King&#x27;s French wife, Queen Henrietta Maria, who was housed in or near what is now the Queen&#x27;s Room, the room above the arch between Front and Fellows&#x27; Quads. A portrait of Charles I hangs near the Queen&#x27;s Room as a reminder of the role it played in his court.

Brent gave evidence against Laud in his trial in 1644. After Laud was executed on 10 January 1645, John Greaves, one of the subwardens of Merton and Savilian Professor of Astronomy, drew up a petition for Brent&#x27;s removal from office; Brent was deposed by Charles I on 27 January 1646 and replaced by William Harvey.

Thomas Fairfax captured Oxford for the Parliamentarians after its third siege in 1646 and Brent returned from London. However, in 1647, a parliamentary commission (visitation) was set up by Parliament &quot;for the correction of offences, abuses, and disorders&quot; in the University of Oxford. Nathaniel Brent was the president of the visitors. Greaves was accused of sequestrating the college&#x27;s plate and funds for King Charles I. Despite a deposition from his brother Thomas, Greaves had lost both his Merton fellowship and his Savilian chair by 9 November 1648.
==Buildings and grounds==
The &quot;House of Scholars of Merton&quot; originally had properties in Surrey (in present-day Old Malden) as well as in Oxford, but it was not until the mid-1260s that Walter de Merton acquired the core of the present site in Oxford, along the south side of what was then St John&#x27;s Street (now Merton Street). The college was consolidated on this site by 1274, when Walter made his final revisions to the college statutes.

The initial acquisition included the parish church of St John (which was superseded by the chapel) and three houses to the east of the church which now form the north range of Front Quad. Walter also obtained permission from the king to extend from these properties south to the old city wall to form an approximately square site. The college continued to acquire other properties as they became available on both sides of Merton Street. At one time, the college owned all the land from the site that is now Christ Church to the south-eastern corner of the city. The land to the east eventually became the current Fellows&#x27; garden, while the western end was leased by Warden Richard Rawlins in 1515 for the foundation of Corpus Christi (at an annual rent of just over £4).

===Chapel===


By the late 1280s, the old church of St John the Baptist had fallen into &quot;a ruinous condition&quot;, and the college accounts show that work on a new church began in about 1290. The present choir, with its enormous east window, was complete by 1294. The window is an important example (because it is so well dated) of how the strict geometrical conventions of the Early English Period of architecture were beginning to be relaxed at the end of the 13th century. The south transept was built in the 14th century, the north transept in the early years of the 15th. The great tower was complete by 1450. The chapel replaced the parish church of St. John and continued to serve as the parish church as well as the chapel until 1891. It is for this reason that it is generally referred to as Merton Church in older documents, and that there is a north door into the street as well as doors into the college. This dual role also probably explains the enormous scale of the chapel, which in its original design was to have a nave and two aisles extending to the west.

A new choral foundation was established in 2007, providing for a choir of sixteen undergraduate and graduate choral scholars singing from October 2008. The choir was formerly directed by Peter Phillips, director of the Tallis Scholars, and is now directed by Benjamin Nicholas, a former director of music at Tewkesbury Abbey. In 2013, the installation of a new organ, designed and built by Dobson Pipe Organ Builders, was completed. The chapel is known for its acoustics.
A spire from the chapel has resided in Pavilion Garden VI of the University of Virginia since 1928, when &quot;it was given to the University to honor Jefferson&#x27;s educational ideals.&quot;

===Front quad and the hall===
The hall is the oldest surviving college building, originally completed before 1277, but apart from the fine medieval ironwork on the door, almost no trace of the ancient structure has survived the successive reconstruction efforts; first by James Wyatt in the 1790s and then again by Gilbert Scott in 1874, whose work included the “handsome oak roof”. The hall is still used daily for meals in term time. It is not usually open to visitors.

Front quad itself is probably the earliest collegiate quadrangle, but its informal, almost haphazard, pattern cannot be said to have influenced designers elsewhere. A reminder of its original domestic nature can be seen in the north east corner where one of the flagstones is marked &quot;Well&quot;. The quad is formed of what would have been the back gardens of the three original houses that Walter acquired in the 1260s.

===Mob Quad and library===
Visitors to Merton are often told that Mob Quad is the oldest quadrangle of any Oxford or Cambridge college and set the pattern for future collegiate architecture. It was built in three phases: 1288–1291, 1304–1311, and finally completed with the Library in 1373–1378. But Merton&#x27;s own Front Quad was probably enclosed earlier, albeit with a less unified design. Other colleges can point to similarly old and unaltered quadrangles, for example Old Court at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, built &quot;c&quot;.1353–1377.

===Fellows&#x27; Quad===
The grandest quadrangle in Merton is the Fellows&#x27; Quadrangle, immediately south of the hall. The quad was the culmination of the work undertaken by Henry Savile at the beginning of the 17th century. The foundation stone was laid shortly after breakfast on 13 September 1608 (as recorded in the college Register), and work was complete by September 1610 (although the battlements were added later). The southern gateway is surmounted by a tower of the four Orders, probably inspired by Italian examples that Warden Savile would have seen on his European travels. The main contractors were from Yorkshire (as was Savile); John Ackroyd and John Bentley of Halifax supervised the stonework, and Thomas Holt the timber. This group were also later employed to work on the Bodleian Library and Wadham College.

===Other buildings===
Most of the other buildings are Victorian or later and include: St. Alban&#x27;s Quad (or &quot;Stubbins&quot;), designed by Basil Champneys, built on the site of the medieval St Alban Hall (elements of the older façade are incorporated into the part that faces onto Merton Street); the Grove building, built in 1864 by William Butterfield but &quot;chastened&quot; in the 1930s by T.H. Hughes; the buildings beyond the Fellows&#x27; Garden called &quot;Rose Lane&quot;; several buildings north of Merton Street, including a real tennis court, and the Old Warden&#x27;s Lodgings (designed by Champneys in 1903); and a new quadrangle in Holywell Street, some distance away from the college.

===TS Eliot Lecture Theatre===
TS Eliot Lecture Theatre is a new lecture theatre named after T. S. Eliot, a former member of the college, opened in 2010. It has a bust of the writer by Jacob Epstein, presented by Frank Brenchley, a former member and Fellow of the college. Brenchley presented his collection of Eliot first editions and ephemera to the college, which is believed to be the second largest collection of such material worldwide. The foyer is illuminated by a lighting display representing three constellations that were visible on the night of 14 September 1264, the day the college was founded.

===Gardens===
The garden fills the southeastern corner of the old walled city of Oxford. The walls may be seen from Christ Church Meadows and Merton Field (now used by Magdalen College School, Oxford as a playing field for cricket, rugby, and football). The gardens are notable for a mulberry tree planted in the early 17th century, an armillary sundial, an extensive lawn, a Herma statue, and the old Fellows&#x27; Summer House (now used as a music room and rehearsal space).

===Gallery===
==Student life==
Merton admits both undergraduate and graduate students. It admitted its first female students in 1980 and was the second former male college to elect a female head of house (in 1994). Merton has traditionally had single-sex accommodation for first-year undergraduates, with female students going into the Rose Lane buildings and most male students going into three houses on Merton Street. This policy was abandoned in 2007, with all accommodation now mixed by sex and course.

Undergraduate admission to the college, like other Oxford colleges, is based solely on academic potential. In 2010, it was (incorrectly) reported that Merton had not admitted a black student in the previous five years. A university spokeswoman commented that black students were more likely to apply for particularly oversubscribed subjects. The university also reported that Merton had admitted at least one black undergraduate since 2005.

===Reputation===
Since the introduction of an official Norrington Table published by the university in 2004, Merton occupied one of the top three positions every year (often coming in 1st), until 2012 when it dropped to 14th. In 2014, it regained the first position, preserving its status as one of the most academically successful colleges of the last twenty years. In 2021, Merton was ranked Oxford&#x27;s top college in the Norrington Table, with a score of 82.9.

===Traditions===
At the &#x27;Time Ceremony&#x27;, students dressed in formal academic dress walk backwards around the Fellows&#x27; Quad drinking port. Traditionally participants also held candles, but this practice has been abandoned in recent years. Many students have now adopted the habit of linking arms and twirling around at each corner of the quad. The alleged purpose of this tradition is to maintain the integrity of the space–time continuum during the transition from British Summer Time to Greenwich Mean Time, which occurs in the early hours of the last Sunday in October. However, the ceremony (invented by two undergraduates in 1971) mostly serves as a spoof of other Oxford ceremonies, and historically as a celebration of the end of the experimental period of British Standard Time from 1968 to 1971 when the UK stayed one hour ahead of GMT all year round. There are three toasts associated with the ceremony. The first is &quot;to a good old time!&quot;; the second, a joint toast to the sundial and the nearby mulberry tree (&quot;morus nigra&quot;), &quot;o tempora, o more&quot;; and the third, &quot;long live the counter-revolution!&quot;.

Merton is the only college in Oxford to hold a triennial winter ball, instead of the more common Commemoration ball. The most recent of these was held on 26 November 2022.

===Societies===
Merton has a number of drinking and dining societies, along the lines of other colleges. These include the all-male Myrmidons, the female-equivalent Myrmaids and L&#x27;Ancien Régime. The Myrmidon club is open to all members of the college in the present day, male or female, and hosts termly black tie events. 

Merton is host to a number of subject-specific societies, the most notable being the Halsbury Society (Law) and the Chalcenterics (Classics). Other academic societies include the Neave Society, which aims to discuss and debate political issues, and the Bodley Club, founded in 1894 as a forum for undergraduate papers on literature but now a speaker society.

====The Bodley Club====
The Bodley Club is a speaker society at Merton College, Oxford. Founded in 1894 as a forum in which undergraduates delivered academic papers on literature, the club has changed form over the years, and was reformed in the 1980s as a speaker society. All members of the college, and usually members of the university as a whole, are invited to their events.

The club began on 19 May 1894 (though it was not christened &#x27;The Bodley Club&#x27; until June). The initial constitution contained a rule (Rule 7) which stated that &#x27;a written paper is preferred, but any member may speak on any literary subject instead or may propose that any literary work be read at the meeting.&#x27; It was not long before this provision was required, as the minute-book reveals in its entry for 19 October 1894: &#x27;Owing to unpardonable slackness on the part of members, the four months of vacation proved insufficient to collect coherent ideas on any particular subject...However an agreeable and instructive evening was passed in reading Tennyson&#x27;s &#x27;Maud&#x27;.&#x27; From early years the club has maintained a troubled existence, and the Secretary noted on 1 November 1900 a motion of censure &#x27;against a person or persons unknown who were responsible for the undoubted blackness which is creeping over the Bodley Club.&#x27; Nevertheless, the club has continued in one form or another to the present day.

Among the notable papers delivered to the Bodley Club are those by Frederic Harrison, Harold Henry Joachim, Henry Hamilton Fyfe (brother of the secretary, William), Northrop Frye, Alister Clavering Hardy, and Ronald Knox. Several of the club&#x27;s first members went on to become significant figures, including Herbert George Flaxman Spurrell and William Hamilton Fyfe.

===Sports===
Merton has a long-standing sporting relationship with Mansfield College, with the colleges fielding amalgamated sports teams for many major sports. In rowing, Merton College Boat Club has been Head of the River in Summer Eights once; its men&#x27;s 1st VIII held the headship in 1951. Merton&#x27;s women have done better in recent years, gaining the headship in Torpids in 2003 and rowing over to defend the title in 2004.

==Grace==
The college preprandial grace is amongst the longest in Oxford, and is always recited before formal dinners in Hall, usually by the senior postmaster present. The first two lines of the Latin text are based on verses 15 and 16 of Psalm 145.
Roughly translated it means:&lt;poem&gt;
:The eyes of the world look up to thee, O Lord. Thou givest them food in due season.
:Thou openest thy hand and fillest every creature with thy blessing.
:Bless us, O God, with all the gifts which by thy good works we are about to receive.
:Through Jesus Christ, Our Lord, Amen.&lt;/poem&gt;

For the relevant verses of the Psalm, the Authorized Version has:
:15. The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.
:16. Thou openst thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.

In contrast, Merton&#x27;s post-prandial grace is brief: &quot;Benedictus benedicat&quot; (&quot;Let him who has been blessed, give blessing&quot;). The latter grace is spoken by the senior Fellow present at the end of dinner on High Table.

At the University of Cambridge, a slightly different version of the Latin text of these verses is painted around Old Hall in Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, and is &quot;commonly in use at other Cambridge colleges&quot;.

==People associated with Merton==
Merton alumni (Mertonians) and fellows have pursued careers in a variety of disciplines.

===1264 to 1900===
Among the earliest people that have been claimed as Merton fellows are William of Ockham and Duns Scotus, outstanding academic figures from the early 14th century (however, these claims are disputed). Other early fellows include the Oxford Calculators, a group of 14th-century thinkers associated with Merton who took a logico-mathematical approach to philosophical problems. Theologian and philosopher John Wycliffe was another early fellow of the college.

Founder of the Bodleian Library, Thomas Bodley, was admitted as fellow in 1564. Another significant figure, Henry Savile, was appointed Warden some years later in 1585 (held the position until 1621) and had great influence of the development of the college. William Harvey, who was the first to describe in detail the systemic circulation, was warden from 1645 to 1646. Lord Randolph Churchill, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons (and father of Winston Churchill), matriculated in October 1867, while Max Beerbohm, an English essayist, parodist, and caricaturist studied at Merton in the 1890s and was Secretary of the Myrmidon Club.

===1900 to today===
Merton has also produced notable alumni and fellows in more recent times. In science, Merton is associated with four Nobel Prize winners: chemist Frederick Soddy (1921), zoologist Nikolaas Tinbergen (1973), physicist Anthony Leggett (2003) and physicist Anton Zeilinger (2022). Other Mertonians in science include Canadian neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield, mathematician Andrew Wiles who proved Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, computer scientist Tony Hoare, chemist George Radda, economist Catherine Tucker, geneticist Alec Jeffreys and cryptographer Artur Ekert.

Notable Mertonians within the field of literature include poet T. S. Eliot, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1948, and author J. R. R. Tolkien who was Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton from 1945 to 1959. Jamaican-British Professor of Sociology Stuart Hall was a pioneer in the academic field of cultural studies and director of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies.

Former students with careers as politicians include British politicians Reginald Maudling, Airey Neave, Jesse Norman, Ed Vaizey, Denis MacShane, Liz Truss and Peter Tapsell, while international alumni include Bob Krueger, former U.S. Senator from Texas, and Arthur Mutambara, former Deputy Prime Minister of Zimbabwe.

In business, former Director-General of the BBC and later CEO of the New York Times Company Mark Thompson, CEO of Stonewall Ben Summerskill and former CEO of Sony Howard Stringer are alumni. In law, Henry Litton served as one of the first Permanent Judges of the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong (Hong Kong&#x27;s court of last resort), while Brian Leveson was President of the Queen&#x27;s Bench Division from 2013 to 2019 and Head of Criminal Justice.

Other alumni include the composer Lennox Berkeley, actor and singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson, mountaineer Andrew Irvine, RAF pilot Leonard Cheshire, athlete and neurologist Roger Bannister (later Master of Pembroke College, Oxford), journalist Tanya Gold and Naruhito, Emperor of Japan.

Oxford-born clinical neuroscientist Irene Tracey was elected as Warden in succession to Martin J. Taylor (former professor of pure mathematics at the University of Manchester) on his retirement in 2018, and served until the start of her tenure as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford in 2023.

===Women at Merton===
Just like the other ancient colleges of Oxford, Merton was originally an all-male college. It admitted its first female students in 1980 and became the second former all-male college to elect a female head of house when Jessica Rawson was appointed as Warden in 1994. Professor Irene Tracey was appointed as Merton&#x27;s second female warden in 2019, and later became Oxford&#x27;s second female vice-chancellor. She was succeeded by another woman as warden, Jennifer Payne.

Alumnae of Merton include the shortest-serving prime minister of the United Kingdom in history Liz Truss and Princess Akiko of Mikasa.

<text>Lincoln College (formally, The College of the Blessed Mary and All Saints, Lincoln) is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford, situated on Turl Street in central Oxford. Lincoln was founded in 1427 by Richard Fleming, the then Bishop of Lincoln.

Notable alumni include the physician John Radcliffe, the founder of Methodism John Wesley, antibiotics scientists Howard Florey, Edward Abraham, and Norman Heatley, writers Theodor Seuss Geisel (Dr. Seuss) and David John Moore Cornwell (John le Carré), the journalist Rachel Maddow, former British prime minister Rishi Sunak, Princess Elisabeth of Belgium, and Labour politician Shabana Mahmood. Mensa was founded at Lincoln College in 1946. Lincoln College has one of the oldest working medieval kitchens in the UK.

==History==

===Founding===

Richard Fleming, the then Bishop of Lincoln, founded the college in order to combat the Lollard teachings of John Wyclif. He intended it to be &quot;a little college of true students of theology who would defend the mysteries of Scripture against those ignorant laymen who profaned with swinish snouts its most holy pearls&quot;.. To this end, he obtained a charter for the college from King Henry VI, which combined the parishes of All Saints, St Michael at the North Gate, and St Mildred&#x27;s within the college under a rector. The college now uses All Saints Church as its library and has strong ties with St Michael&#x27;s Church at the North Gate, having used it as a stand-in for the college chapel when necessary.

Despite insufficient endowment and trouble from the Wars of the Roses (for their charter was from the deposed Lancastrian), the college has survived and flourished thanks to the efforts of its fellows and the munificence of a second bishop of Lincoln, Thomas Rotherham. Richard Fleming died in 1431, and the first rector, William Chamberleyn, in 1434, leaving the college with few buildings and little money. The second rector, John Beke, secured the college&#x27;s safety by attracting donors. By 1436, the college had seven fellows. John Forest, Dean of Wells and a close friend of Beke&#x27;s, donated such an amount that the college promised to recognise him as a co-founder; it did not keep this promise. His gifts saw the construction of a chapel, a library, hall and kitchen. After a pointed sermon from the incumbent rector, Thomas Rotherham was compelled to give his support and effectively re-founded it in 1478, with a new charter from King Edward IV.

===18th century===
In the 18th century, Lincoln became the cradle of Methodism when John Wesley, a fellow there from 1726, held religious meetings with his brother Charles and the rest of Wesley&#x27;s &#x27;Holy Club&#x27;, whom the rest of the university took to calling &#x27;Bible-moths&#x27;. His appearances at College became less frequent after he departed for Georgia as a missionary chaplain in 1735. Indeed, he took to signing his publications as &quot;John Wesley, Sometime Fellow of Lincoln College&quot;. A portrait of him hangs in the Hall, and a bust overlooks the front quad. The room where he is believed to have worked is also named after him, and was renovated by American Methodists at the beginning of the 20th century.

===Rivalry===
As is common with Oxford colleges, the college has a long-standing rivalry with neighbour Brasenose College (which was founded by a later bishop of Lincoln, William Smyth). The two colleges share a tradition revived annually on Ascension Day. The story goes that, centuries ago, as a mob chased students at the university through the town, the Lincoln porter allowed in the Lincoln students but refused entry to the Brasenose member, leaving him to the mercy of the mob. An alternative is that a Lincoln man bested a Brasenose man in a duel. Either episode resulted in the Brasenose student&#x27;s death, and ever since, on Ascension Day, Lincoln College has invited in members of Brasenose College every year through the one door connecting the two colleges, for free beer as penance. Since the nineteenth century, the beer has been flavoured with ivy so as to discourage excessive consumption.

===Modern day===
Academically, Lincoln was one of the top ten in the Norrington Table each year from 2006 to 2015 (excluding 2010 and 2011). Lincoln ranked third in the Norrington Table in 2021 and second in 2022.

The college is associated with the Goblin Club, an exclusive all-male dining society founded in 1902. In May 2019, the JCR voted to extend a ban on the society on the grounds that it was perceived to be both elitist and racist.

In 1958, the college was the first in Oxford or Cambridge to provide a Middle Common Room exclusively for the use of graduate students. Like many of Oxford&#x27;s colleges, Lincoln admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979, after more than half a millennium as a men-only institution. The MCR is now located in the Berrow Foundation Building, which was inaugurated in 2014.

In 2007, the college took the rare step of unveiling a commissioned portrait of two members of staff who were not fellows or benefactors of the college, in commemoration of their work. Chef Jim Murden and butler Kevin Egleston have worked in the college&#x27;s kitchen and buttery for 33 and 28 years respectively, as of 2010. Artist Daphne Todd was commissioned for the painting, who has had such previous sitters as the Grand Duke of Luxembourg and Spike Milligan.

As part of the college&#x27;s commitment to environmental sustainability, a dedicated Green Impact team was set up in 2021, which has since won an Oxford University gold award. Biodiversity initiatives across the college&#x27;s various properties have led to creation of a wild-flower garden outside the entrance to the college library.

==Architecture==

According to Nikolaus Pevsner, Lincoln College preserves &quot;more of the character of a 15th century college than any other in Oxford&quot;. This is mainly because both the façade to Turl Street and the front quad are still of only two storeys (although the parapets and battlements are of the 19th century). The college also owns most of the buildings across Turl Street from the college proper, in whole or in part, which chiefly contain student accommodation. The creeper that covers the college&#x27;s front quad walls is Virginia creeper (&quot;Parthenocissus quinquefolia&quot;), dark green in the summer, through to scarlet in autumn, whilst being bare in winter.

There are three quads: the Front Quad (15th century), the Chapel Quad (1608–1631) and The Grove (19th century), as well as a number of irregular spaces. Unlike many other colleges, all of the architecture of the college proper is stone and there is no modern accommodation annexe. To quote the Lincoln College Freshers&#x27; Handbook, &quot;Unlike most colleges, we have no grotty sixties annexe to spoil all the pretty bits&quot;. The college bar, Deep Hall (or &quot;Deepers&quot;), is immediately below the great hall and used to be the college beer cellar. It is one of the oldest parts of the college, and the pillars inside it are perhaps the oldest feature of the college. The wine cellar is accessed through Deep Hall, and extends completely beneath the Grove.

The Rector&#x27;s lodgings in Turl Street are neo-Georgian and were built in 1929–1930; they are reached from within college through a gate in Chapel Quad, but have a main door on Turl Street.

The college is known as being the setting for many literary works. C. P. Snow was inspired for his novel &quot;The Masters&quot; by the story of Mark Pattison, a fellow at Lincoln, whose enthusiastic hopes for Lincoln were frustrated by older, more conservative fellows of the college; Snow&#x27;s story transposes the story to a Cambridge College. It was the setting for three episodes of &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;. Later, &quot;Lewis&quot; has used Turl Street in front of the college for filming. Lincoln College is the setting for much of the plot in &quot;Heresy&quot; by S.J. Parris (pseudonym for the literary critic Stephanie Merritt), a historical crime novel.

===Chapel===
The college chapel was built in late perpendicular style between 1629 and 1631; its windows are enamelled rather than stained, which is a process of painting the windows then firing them, a complicated procedure. They are the work of Abraham van Linge, who was an expert in this technique. The east window of the chapel depicts twelve biblical scenes: the top six depict scenes from Jesus&#x27; life (including the Last Supper), whilst the six below depict corresponding scenes from the Old Testament (including Adam and Eve at Creation and the whale spitting out Jonah). The north windows show the Twelve Prophets, and the south windows the Twelve Apostles. The screen separating the ante-chapel (containing the organ) from the chapel proper is made of cedar, and reportedly filled the chapel with the strong scent of cedar for around the first one hundred years of its existence.

Much of the chapel was restored in a project beginning in 1999, having been deemed to be in unacceptable disrepair in the early 1990s, when a funding campaign began. The black slate and white marble tiles were repaired, cleaned and replaced where necessary, whilst most of the age damage was to be found in the woodwork, which was suffering greatly from poor ventilation and having been laid directly on to earth, resulting in worm and wet rot. Cracks in the enamel of the windows were also repaired where most obvious and disfiguring. The renovations were made with the intention of preserving the chapel&#x27;s 17th-century character as much as possible. The chapel has remained much unchanged since the wooden figurines (of Saint Peter, Saint Paul, Moses and Aaron) were placed on the front pews and the carved ceiling was installed in the 1680s.

===Library===

Perhaps the college&#x27;s most striking feature, its library, is located in the converted 18th-century All Saints Church handed over to the college in 1971. All Saints church tower is a feature of Oxford&#x27;s skyline, one of the city&#x27;s &quot;dreaming spires&quot;. After the church spire collapsed in 1700, amateur architect and Dean of Christ Church Henry Aldrich designed a new church. It is believed, however, that on some of the later features of the church, particularly on the tower and spire, the work of Nicholas Hawksmoor, the Baroque architects, is to be found. The tower has a full peal of eight bells, which are regularly rung.

Its library holds some 60,000 books. Graduates and undergraduates are able to work in the building until 2.00 a.m. most nights; the Bodleian and faculty libraries have earlier closing times. It is kept up-to-date by regular purchases, and welcomes suggestions for books pertinent to studies. The upper reading room, or Cohen Room, has an elaborate plastered ceiling and the Senior Library (downstairs) holds some of the college&#x27;s older books, including pamphlets from the English Civil War, Wesleyana, and plays dating from the late 17th and early 18th centuries, as well as a small collection of manuscripts. The science library is also to be found downstairs. Access to the library is generally restricted to current students and staff at the college, although alumni may use the library if acceptable justification is provided.

==Academic links==
Lincoln College has visiting undergraduate student arrangements with Middlebury College, Simon&#x27;s Rock College of Bard, Drew University, and National Taiwan University. The college also has ties to Middlebury College&#x27;s &quot;Bread Loaf School of English&quot;, which runs a summer graduate course using Lincoln&#x27;s facilities during the University of Oxford&#x27;s long summer vacation. A clock donated by Middlebury stands in the Porters&#x27; Lodge.

==Grace==
The college grace is read aloud at every formal hall, usually by a student. To encourage readers, students who read the grace twice in a term receive a bottle of wine. The college grace is in Latin.

==Coat of arms==

The college arms incorporate (1) the arms of Bishop Richard Fleming, the founder; (2) the arms of the See of Lincoln; (3) the arms of Bishop Thomas Rotherham, the second founder.

The blazon is:
:Tierced per pale, Barry of six argent and azure, in chief three lozenges gules, on the second bar of an argent a mullet pierced sable; Argent, thereon an escutcheon of Gules two lions passant guardant or, on a chief azure the Blessed Virgin Mary ducally crowned seated on a throne issuant from the chief, on her dexter arm the infant Jesus and holding in her sinister hand a sceptre, all gold: the escutcheon ensigned with a mitre azure garnished and stringed or; Vert, three stags statant two and one or.

==Student life==

===Accommodation===
The college guarantees all undergraduates three years of college-owned accommodation. Similarly, virtually all graduate students are provided housing for the duration of their studies. The college&#x27;s housing stock is extensive and centrally located. About 50 students live on the three quads described above, with over 100 more living in rooms above the shops on the other side of Turl Street. These include the Mitre rooms, formerly guest rooms of the Mitre Inn, which has been owned by the college since the 15th century. The accommodation was incorporated into the college in 1969, but the restaurants were left to the inn. Lincoln House, directly across from the college, was constructed in 1939 as an annexe. There were at one point vague plans for a bridge over Turl Street connecting the annexe to the college proper; these never materialised. Further accommodation is provided at Bear Lane (across High Street). Donors Emily and John Carr gave to the college numbers 113 and 114 on the High Street, with land extending back to Bear Lane, which the college still owns and constitutes the Bear Lane accommodation.

On Museum Road near Keble College is a further accommodation complex. 12 terraced houses are officially called Lincoln Hall, but most commonly referred to as simply &#x27;Mus Road&#x27;. The EPA Science Centre, named after Edward Abraham, was constructed behind them in the early 21st century and contains apartment-style accommodation, teaching facilities and the college&#x27;s archives. A number of outlying houses make up the remainder of the housing stock.

===Junior Common Room===
Due to Lincoln&#x27;s small numbers and tight-knit community, its Junior Common Room (JCR) plays a greater role in student life than do the JCRs of most other colleges. JCR elections, held in Trinity and Michaelmas Terms, attract one of the highest turnouts of any Oxford college. The JCR, like all JCRs in Oxford, is both a communal room for undergraduates (with a television, kitchen, vending machine, daily newspapers, a DVD library and sofas) as well as the name of the body that represents said undergraduates to the senior members of college and on a university-wide basis. All undergraduate members of the college are automatically members of the JCR, unless they specifically express a desire not to be a part of it. Honorary membership to others is sometimes extended, but have limited rights compared to other members.

The JCR is run by an Executive of ten officers, headed by the President, which is ultimately responsible for the JCR, whilst the JCR Committee comprises forty-two members and fulfils a wide range of duties, all aimed at the general improvement of the lives of and facilities available to the undergraduate body of the college. Members of the JCR Committee are elected by popular vote. Shabana Mahmood, the MP for Birmingham Ladywood, served as JCR president in 2000–2001. JCR meetings are held three times a term, in 2nd week, 5th week and 8th week of each.

The JCR was founded in 1854 as the Lincoln College Debating Society but was renamed in 1919 (although it continued to be referred to by its former name for some time after). From 1886, the society provided members of the Common Room with tobacco and cigarettes from its funds, as well as tea and coffee; however, &quot;The President shall have the power to stop smoking while the Torpid &quot;[a rowing eight entering a regatta in Hilary Term]&quot; and the Eight &quot;[an eight entering a regatta in Trinity Term]&quot; are in training.&quot; Tobacco and cigarettes are no longer available from the JCR, but tea and coffee are to be found in the JCR kitchen.

===Middle Common Room===
The Lincoln MCR is the oldest (founded in 1960) of the Oxford MCRs. With around 350 graduate students in residence each year, the MCR organises a full and varied programme of meetings, social events and sporting activities during term time and vacations. The MCR is located in the Berrow Foundation Building, completed in 2016 by design studio Stanton Williams.

==People associated with Lincoln==

Notable former students of the college have progressed to careers in academia, business, politics and sports. Alumni include; John Radcliffe (renowned physician after whom the Radcliffe Camera, Radcliffe Infirmary, Radcliffe Observatory and John Radcliffe Hospital are named), Howard Florey (who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945 for his role in large scale production of penicillin), Edward Abraham and Norman Heatley (biochemists also instrumental in the development of penicillin), Philip May (husband of former Prime Minister Theresa May), Steph Cook (Olympic gold medalist), William Davenant (poet), John Hobson (economist and influential theorist of imperialism), John le Carré (author), Rachel Maddow (political commentator and author), Dr. Seuss (author and illustrator), Nevil Sidgwick (chemist), Rishi Sunak (British Prime Minister), Adebayo Ogunlesi (lawyer and investment banker), Deborah Bowman (medical ethicist), Edward Thomas (poet) and John Wesley (theologian).

From 1954 to 1972, the Rector of the college was Walter Fraser Oakeshott, most famous for discovering the Winchester Manuscript of Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur in 1934 while an Assistant Master at Winchester College, and after whom Lincoln College&#x27;s largest performance space is named.

The academic Mark Pattison, elected as Rector of the college in 1861, is thought to have been the inspiration for the character of Dr. Casaubon in George Eliot&#x27;s novel Middlemarch.

The current Rector of Lincoln College is Henry Woudhuysen. He will retire at the end of the 2023/24 academic year. 

Lincoln was the first college in Oxford (or Cambridge) to admit a Jewish Fellow, the Australian-born philosopher Samuel Alexander (appointed 1882).

Years after the success of his Cold War spy novels, novelist and Lincoln graduate John le Carré, himself a one-time spy, revealed that fictional spymaster George Smiley was partly modelled on former Lincoln rector Vivian H. H. Green. At least one other recent Lincoln Rector, Sir Maurice Shock, enjoyed a prior career in British intelligence, although there is little evidence to substantiate the college&#x27;s reputation as a recruiting ground for spies.

In 1955, Paul Shuffrey, the civil servant and editor, and a former Lincoln student, endowed a fellowship in memory of his father, the leading architect and architectural designer, Leonard Shuffrey.

Between 1998 and 2002, five future Parliamentarians studied at Lincoln at overlapping times: Rishi Sunak, Lee Rowley, Miatta Fahnbulleh, Shabana Mahmood and Charles Banner.

Princess Elisabeth of Belgium, heir apparent to King Philippe, started to read history and politics in 2021.

<text>New College is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1379 by Bishop William of Wykeham in conjunction with Winchester College as New College&#x27;s feeder school, New College was one of the first colleges in the university to admit and tutor undergraduate students. 

The college is in the centre of Oxford, between Holywell Street and New College Lane (known for Oxford&#x27;s Bridge of Sighs). Its sister college is King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. The choir of New College has recorded over one hundred albums, and has won two Gramophone Awards.

== History ==
Despite its name, New College is one of the oldest of the Oxford colleges; it was founded in 1379 by William of Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester, as &quot;Saint Mary College of Winchester in Oxenford&quot;, with both graduates and undergraduates. It became known as &quot;New College&quot; because there was already a college dedicated to St Mary in Oxford (Oriel College).

=== Foundation ===
In 1379 William of Wykeham decided to found a college. He applied to King Richard II for a royal charter permitting the foundation. In addition, he wrote a charter of his own, requiring his college to have a warden and seventy scholars. He purchased the necessary land in separate lots from the City of Oxford, Merton College and Queen&#x27;s College. The area had been the City Ditch, a dangerous place by the city&#x27;s wall; it had been used within living memory for burials during the Black Death.

The college was founded the same year in conjunction with a feeder school, Winchester College (founded 1382, opened 1394). The two institutions have striking architectural similarities: both were the work of master mason William Wynford. The first stone was laid on 5 March 1380. The college had occupied the buildings by 14 April 1386. William of Wykeham then drew up the statutes of the college. The coat of arms of the college is William of Wykeham&#x27;s. It features two black chevrons, one said to have been added when he became a bishop and the other possibly representing his skill with architecture, since the chevron was a device used by masons. Winchester College uses the same arms. The college&#x27;s motto, created by William of Wykeham, is &quot;Manners Makyth Man&quot;.

New College was established to have prayers said for William of Wykeham&#x27;s soul. He instructed that there were to be ten chaplains, three clerks and a choir of 16 choristers on the foundation of the college. 

As well as being one of the first Oxford colleges to take undergraduates and to appoint tutors to teach them, New College was the first in Oxford to be deliberately designed around a main quadrangle. The college was about as large as all of the (six) existing Oxford colleges combined.

=== Civil wars ===
The Royalists used the cloisters and bell tower to store munitions early in the English Civil War. In August 1651, the college was fortified by Parliamentarian forces. In 1685, Monmouth&#x27;s rebellion involved Robert Sewster, a fellow of the college, who commanded a company of university volunteers, mostly from New College; they exercised on the bowling green.

=== Academic ===
Students at New College were until 1834 exempt from taking the university&#x27;s examinations for the BA and (in earlier times) the MA degrees, and were also ineligible for honours, though they still had to take the college&#x27;s own tests. The college used to have a reputation for &quot;Golden scholars, silver bachelors, leaden masters and wooden doctors.&quot; More recently, like many of Oxford&#x27;s colleges, New College admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979, after six centuries as an institution for men only.

In 2022, students at New College scored 75.5 on the Norrington Table.

The choristers were originally accommodated within the walls of the college, under one schoolmaster. Since then the school has expanded; in 1903 the choristers moved to New College School in Savile Road.

== College links ==
King Henry VI is said to have established his own new colleges, King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and Eton College, either in admiration of William of Wykeham&#x27;s twinned institutions of New College and Winchester College, or at least to have modified his plans to outdo them.

New College and Winchester College have from the mid 15th century been formally linked to Eton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, a four-way relationship known as the &quot;Amicabilis Concordia&quot;. King&#x27;s and New College are sister colleges.

== Buildings and gardens ==

At the time of its foundation, the college was a grand example of the &quot;perpendicular style&quot;. With the evolution of the college over the centuries, it has regularly added to its original quadrangle. The upper storey of the quad was added in the sixteenth century as attics which, in 1674, were replaced by a third storey proper as seen today. The oval turf at the centre of the quad is an eighteenth-century addition. 
Many of its buildings are listed as being of special architectural or historical importance. 

The initial building phase saw the construction of the Great Quad with the Gate Tower, the dining hall with the four-storeyed Muniment Tower for access, the chapel, the cloisters (consecrated as a burial site in 1400) with the four-storeyed bell tower (1400), along with the Warden&#x27;s Barn in New College Lane (1402) and the Long Room (behind the SE corner of the Great Quad), purpose-built as a garderobe. 

The three-sided Garden Quadrangle, open at one end and begun by the addition of The Chequer to the east of the Great Quad in 1449, was completed in two stages between 1682 and 1707. Further college expansion led to the formation of Holywell Quad in the 19th century. A range known as &#x27;New Buildings&#x27; was built along Holywell Street between 1872 and 1896, partly by George Gilbert Scott in High Victorian style (1872), and partly, including the Robinson Tower over the entrance gates, by Basil Champneys in late Victorian style (1885, 1896).

New College is building a new development on its Savile Road site, next to New College School. The Gradel Quadrangles were designed by David Kohn Architects and received planning permission in June 2018. They will provide an additional 99 student rooms, additional dining and kitchen space, a flexible learning hub and a performance venue. In 2022, Sir Robert McAlpine was proceeding with construction.

=== Hall ===

The hall is the dining room of the college and its dimensions are eighty feet by forty feet (24 m × 12 m). In his charter, Wykeham forbade wrestling, dancing and all noisy games in the hall due to the close proximity of the college chapel and the lodgings below the hall; he further prescribed the use of Latin in conversation. The linenfold panelling was added while Archbishop Warham was bursar. The floor was paved with marble in 1722. By the end of the 18th century, the open oak roof had been replaced by a ceiling. When the Junior Common Room offered £1000 to restore the hall roof, work began in 1865 under the architect George Gilbert Scott to create the current roof. The plain windows were replaced with stained glass, and the portraits were relocated. The hall underwent a major restoration project in 2015.

=== Chapel &amp; cloisters ===

The chapel was based on the plan of Merton Chapel. The transepts and tower that made Merton Chapel T-shaped were omitted, and a screen separated the main chapel from the ante-chapel. The medieval interior was modified after the Reformation, with the removal of secondary altars, the rood loft, and the reredos&#x27; statues, the reredos being covered in plaster.
Much of the medieval stained glass in the ante-chapel was restored in a 20-year project which was commended in the 2007 Oxford Preservation Trust Environmental Awards. The chapel contains a statue of Lazarus by Sir Jacob Epstein and a painting by El Greco. Some of the stained glass windows, including the Great West Window, were designed by the 18th-century portraitist Sir Joshua Reynolds.

The choir stalls contain a &quot;splendid set&quot; of 62 14th-century misericords. 
The niches of the reredos, which had been plastered over, were uncovered in the 1780s, and were fitted with statues by Sir Gilbert Scott in the late 19th century. The chapel preserves the Founder&#x27;s Crosier, a bishop&#x27;s staff decorated with enamel and silver gilt; it resembles a crosier at Cologne Cathedral.

The cloisters, containing a large holm oak tree, sit by the western wall of the Chapel, were featured in &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, in the scene in which Draco Malfoy is turned into a white ferret. 
Michael Darbie recast the original five bells of the bell tower into eight in 1655, creating the first set of eight to be cast simultaneously. In 1712, two more bells were added, supposedly to outmatch Magdalen College&#x27;s new ring of eight bells created in that year. The bells are rung by the Oxford Society of Change Ringers.

=== Gardens and city wall ===

The Middle Gateway opens to the Garden Quadrangle. The gardens include a mound that was first arranged in 1594 (with steps added in 1649, but now smooth with one set of stairs). In a 1761 edition of &quot;Pocket Companion for Oxford&quot; the mound is described:

: &quot;In the middle of the Garden is a beautiful Mount with an easy ascent to the top of it, and the Walks around it, as well as the Summit of it, guarded with Yew Hedges. The Area before the Mount being divided into four Quarters, [..] the King&#x27;s Arms, [..] opposite to it the Founder&#x27;s; in the third a Sun Dial; and the Fourth, a Garden-Knot, all planted in Box, and neatly cut.&quot;

When William of Wykeham acquired the land on which to build the college, he agreed to maintain the city wall. The herbaceous border that runs alongside the wall is mentioned in Historic England&#x27;s listing of the garden.

=== Sports ground ===
The New College sports ground south of the University Parks was established in the 1880s. The Weston buildings, which accommodate postgraduate students, were built next to the ground in 1999.

=== Treasures ===

The college treasures include paintings and a substantial silver collection. The library contains a copy of the first printed edition of Aristotle. A Barbara Hepworth statue stands by the City Wall.

== Music ==

=== Choir ===


In 1379, William of Wykeham provided for a choral foundation of clerks and boy choristers. The tradition continues today with choral services during term.
The choir often performs Renaissance and Baroque music, including Handel&#x27;s works. 
As well as appearing repeatedly at the BBC Proms, the choir has made numerous concert tours.

The choir has recorded over one hundred albums. In 1997, the choir won a Gramophone Award in the best-selling disc category for their album &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;, and in 2008, they won a Gramophone Award in the early music category for their recording of Nicholas Ludford&#x27;s &quot;Missa Benedicta&quot;. 
On 29 June 2015, at the invitation of the Holy See and the Cappella Musicale Pontificia Sistina, the choir sang at the Papal Pallium mass for the Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

=== Organ ===

The original organ was given by William Porte (1420–1423). An organ was removed in 1547 under Edward VI, and likewise in 1572. A Willis organ installed in 1874 contained parts from organs by Samuel Green in 1776, James Chapman Bishop, and Dallam in 1663.

The present instrument was constructed by Grant, Degens and Bradbeer in 1969. In 2014 the organ was restored, with the key actions and other mechanisms being completely renewed by Goetze and Gwynn.

== Student life ==
=== Outreach ===

New College has launched Step-Up, a sustained contact outreach initiative which seeks to inspire students from partner schools in England and Wales to apply to Oxford and supports them to make a competitive application. The college founded the Oxford for Wales consortium, Oxford Cymru, along with Jesus College and St Catherine&#x27;s College, offering support to students from state schools in Wales.

=== Rowing ===
A New College rowing eight is recorded from 1840; the New College Boat Club was &quot;Head of the River&quot; in Eights Week in 1887 and several years from 1896. The club headed the Torpids competition in 1882, 1896, and 1900 to 1904. 
The club represented Great Britain at the Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1912, and earned a silver medal.

The warden is supported by specialist officers including tutors, bursar, librarian, and chaplain. 

The students are divided into a Middle Common Room consisting of the college&#x27;s graduates, and a Junior Common Room for the undergraduates; these are run by their own committees.

<text>Nuffield College () is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England. It is a graduate college specialising in the social sciences, particularly economics, politics and sociology. Nuffield is one of Oxford&#x27;s newer colleges, having been founded in 1937, as well as one of the smallest, with only around 90 students and 60 academic fellows. It was also the first Oxford college to accept both men and women, having been coeducational since foundation, as well as being the first college exclusively for graduate students in either Oxford or Cambridge.

As of 2021, the college had an estimated financial endowment of £282 million. Due to its small intake, it was the wealthiest educational institution per student in the world in 2013. Since 2017, Nuffield has committed to underwriting funding for all new students accepted to the college. Between 2019 and 2023, 5.1% of applicants to the college were admitted.

Its architecture is designed to conform to the traditional college layout and its modernist spire is a landmark for those approaching Oxford from the west.

== History ==

Nuffield College was founded in 1937 after a donation to the University of Oxford by Lord Nuffield, the industrialist and founder of Morris Motors. On 16 November 1937, the University entered a Deed of Covenant and Trust with Lord Nuffield. He donated land for the college on New Road, to the west of the city centre near the mound of Oxford Castle, on the site of the largely disused basin of the Oxford Canal. As well as the land, Nuffield gave £900,000 to build the college and to provide it with an endowment. For the creation of Nuffield College and for his other donations he was described in 1949 by an editorial in &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;the greatest benefactor of the University since the Middle Ages&quot;.

From its inception, Nuffield College initiated a number of trends at both Oxford and Cambridge. It was the first college to have both women and men housed together. It was also the first college to consist solely of graduate students. In addition, it was the first in modern times to have a defined subject focus, namely the social sciences.

Nuffield appointed its first fellows in 1939, a group that notably included the historian Margery Perham, but the outbreak of World War II meant that the college&#x27;s construction did not begin until 1949. During the War, Nuffield hosted the Nuffield College Social Reconstruction Survey, which examined issues related to post-War reconstruction. Nuffield admitted its first students in 1945, and received its Royal Charter from the hands of the Duke of Edinburgh on 6 June 1958.

In the 1960s, Nuffield became closely associated with Harold Wilson&#x27;s &quot;modernizing&quot; Labour government. During his tenure as Wilson&#x27;s Chancellor of the Exchequer, future Labour prime minister James Callaghan, who had no formal university education, took tutorials in economics at Nuffield overseen by College fellow Ian Little. Such was the perceived intimacy between College and government that decades later, writer Christopher Hitchens could recall the &quot;fast set that revolved between Nuffield and Whitehall&quot;.

==Buildings==

Nuffield is located on the site of the basin of the Oxford Canal to the west of Oxford. The land on which the college stands was formerly the city&#x27;s principal canal basin and coal wharfs..
The architect Austen Harrison, who had worked in Greece and British Mandatory Palestine, was appointed by the University to design the buildings. His initial design, heavily influenced by Mediterranean architecture, was rejected by Nuffield, who called it &quot;un-English&quot; and refused to allow his name to be associated with it. Harrison reworked the plans, aiming for &quot;something on the lines of Cotswold domestic architecture&quot;, as Nuffield wanted. The plans were approved by Lord Nuffield in 1940. Construction of the college began after the war in 1949. Restrictions on construction after the Second World War meant that work on the college was not completed until 1960. The original plan for the college to occupy land on both sides of Worcester Street was scaled down as a result of budget and material shortages, and to this day the land to the west of the college is occupied by a &quot;temporary&quot; car park. In one change, the tower, which had been planned to be ornamental, was redesigned to hold the college&#x27;s library. It was the first tower built in Oxford for 200 years and is about tall, including the flèche on top. The buildings are arranged around two quadrangles, with residential accommodation for students and fellows in one, and the hall, library and administrative offices in the other. The chapel has stained glass windows designed by John Piper.

The architectural aesthetic of the final design, particularly the tower and its flèche, has attracted some criticism; unlike the other &quot;dreaming spires&quot; of Oxford, Nuffield&#x27;s tower is a masonry-clad steel-framed book-stack. The architectural historian Sir Howard Colvin said that Harrison&#x27;s first design was Oxford&#x27;s &quot;most notable architectural casualty of the 1930s&quot;; it has also been described as a &quot;missed opportunity&quot; to show that Oxford did not live &quot;only in the past&quot;. Reaction to the architecture of the college has been largely unfavourable. In the 1960s, it was described as &quot;Oxford&#x27;s biggest monument to barren reaction&quot;. The tower has been described as &quot;ungainly&quot;, and marred by repetitive windows. The travel writer Jan Morris wrote that the college was &quot;a hodge-podge from the start&quot;. However, the architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, although unimpressed with most of the college, thought that the tower helped the Oxford skyline and predicted it would &quot;one day be loved&quot;. The writer Simon Jenkins doubted Pevsner&#x27;s prediction, and claimed that &quot;vegetation&quot; was the &quot;best hope&quot; for the tower – as well as the rest of the college.

==Academics==
Around a third of Nuffield&#x27;s fellows hold appointments at the University of Oxford as lecturers, readers or professors. In addition, the college fully funds around a dozen &quot;Official Fellowships&quot;, which the college views as tenured research professorships (although most also teach on the University&#x27;s graduate programme), and about a dozen three-year Postdoctoral research fellows. The college also houses a number of young scholars who hold distinguished awards, such as British Academy post-doctoral fellowships, some senior research fellows and a group of research-active emeritus and honorary fellows. The college also produces works in the Nuffield Election Studies. The college is also home to the Centre for Social Investigation, an interdisciplinary research group examining inequalities and social progress in Britain.

The college was the birthplace of the &quot;Oxford School&quot; of Industrial Relations; it pioneered the development of cost-benefit analysis for developing countries; and it has made a major contribution to the methodology of econometrics.

==Student Life==
All Nuffield students are members of the College Junior Common Room. Annual traditions include the Nuffield ball and Christmas Pantomime. All members of the College enjoy free lunches throughout the year. Nuffield fields men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cricket and football teams, while rowing is in association with the Linacre College Boat Club.

<text>Goldsboro, originally Goldsborough, is a city in and the county seat of Wayne County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 33,657 at the 2020 census. It is the principal city of and is included in the Goldsboro, North Carolina Metropolitan Statistical Area. The nearby town of Waynesboro was founded in 1787, and Goldsboro was incorporated in 1847. It is the county seat of Wayne County.

The city is situated in North Carolina&#x27;s Coastal Plain and is bordered on the south by the Neuse River and the west by the Little River, approximately southwest of Greenville, southeast of Raleigh, the state capital, and north of Wilmington in Southeastern North Carolina. Seymour Johnson Air Force Base is located in Goldsboro.

==History==
Around 1787, when Wayne County was formed, a town named Waynesborough grew around the county&#x27;s courthouse. In 1787, William Whitfield III (son of William Whitfield II) and his son were appointed &quot;Directors and Trustees&quot;
for designing and building the town. Located on the east bank of the Neuse River, the town became the county seat. Population growth in Waynesborough continued through the 1830s. However, this changed once the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad was completed in the early 1840s. By then, a hotel had been built at the intersection of the railroad and New Bern Road, which grew into a community after the train started to transport passengers from there.

More and more citizens soon relocated from Waynesborough to this growing village, named eventually &quot;Goldsborough&#x27;s Junction&quot; after Major Matthew T. Goldsborough, an Assistant Chief Engineer with the railroad line. Later this was shortened simply to Goldsborough. In 1847, the town was incorporated and became the new Wayne County seat following a vote of the citizens of Wayne County. Local legend has it the Goldsborough supporters put moonshine in the town&#x27;s well to encourage people to vote for Goldsborough.

In the following decades, Goldsborough&#x27;s growth continued in part by new railroad connections to Charlotte and Beaufort. By 1861, the town&#x27;s population was estimated to be 1,500. It was the trading center of a rural area that started with yeoman farmers. By this time, it had been developed as large cotton plantations dependent on the labor of enslaved African Americans, as the invention of the cotton gin had enabled profitable cultivation of short-staple cotton in the up-counties.

Because of its importance as railroad junction, Goldsborough played a significant role in the Civil War, both for stationing Confederate troops and for transporting their supplies. The town also provided hospitals for soldiers wounded in nearby battles.

In December 1862, the Battle of Goldsborough Bridge was waged, in which both sides fought for possession of the strategically significant Wilmington and Weldon Railroad Bridge. Union General John Foster arrived with his troops on December 17, aiming to destroy this bridge in order to put an end to the vital supply chain from the port of Wilmington. He succeeded on that same day, his troops overpowering the small number of defending Confederate soldiers and burning down the bridge. On their way back to New Bern, Foster&#x27;s men were attacked again by Confederate troops, but they survived with fewer casualties than the enemy. The important bridge at Goldsborough was rebuilt in a matter of weeks.

Goldsborough was the scene of another Union offensive in 1865, during Union General Sherman&#x27;s Carolinas Campaign. After the battles of Bentonville and Wyse Fork, Sherman&#x27;s forces met with the armies of Schofield, their troops taking over the city in March. During the following three weeks, Goldsborough was occupied by over 100,000 Union soldiers. After the war was over, some of these troops continued to stay in the city.

In 1869, the spelling of the city was officially changed to Goldsboro. Wayne County was part of North Carolina&#x27;s 2nd congressional district following the Civil War, when it was known as the &quot;Black Second&quot;, for its majority-black population. This district elected four Republican African Americans to Congress in the 19th century, three of them &quot;after&quot; the Reconstruction era. The attorney George Henry White was the last to serve, being elected in 1894 and serving two terms.

The Democrat-dominated legislature established legal racial segregation in public facilities. To further this, in the 1880s it authorized a facility to serve the black mentally ill, the State Hospital in Goldsboro. In 1899 the legislature authorized an addition but did not appropriate sufficient funds. This operated until after passage of civil rights legislation requiring integration of public facilities. In addition, the hospital was affected by the 1970s movement to de-institutionalize care for the mentally ill. Most states have failed to adequately support community programs to replace such facilities.

During World War II the North Carolina congressional delegation was successful in gaining the present-day Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, which opened on the outskirts of Goldsboro in April 1942 as a US Army Air Forces installation named Seymour Johnson Field. From this point on, the city&#x27;s population and businesses increased as a result of the federal defense installation. The base&#x27;s name was changed to Seymour Johnson AFB in 1947 following the establishment of the US Air Force as an independent service.

The city is home to Goldsboro Milling Company, the 10th largest producer of hogs in the U.S., and also a major producer of turkeys.
The Borden Manufacturing Company, First Presbyterian Church, L. D. Giddens and Son Jewelry Store, Goldsboro Union Station, Harry Fitzhugh Lee House, Odd Fellows Lodge, and Solomon and Henry Weil Houses are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Nuclear accident===

In 1961, two 3.8 megaton hydrogen bombs were dropped accidentally on the village of Faro, north of Goldsboro, after a B-52 aircraft broke up in mid air. The two Mark 39 nuclear bombs were released after the crew abandoned a B-52 bomber which had suffered mid-flight structural failure. Both bombs went through several steps in the arming sequence, but neither detonated. One bomb was recovered. Although much of the second bomb was also recovered, a missing piece containing uranium was believed to have sunk deep into the swampy earth and could not be recovered. The piece remains in land that the Air Force eventually purchased in order to prevent any land use or digging. In 2013, it was revealed that three safety mechanisms on one bomb had failed, leaving just one low-voltage switch preventing detonation.

<doc id="128361" wikidata="Q2024271" url="?curid=128361" title="Pikeville, North Carolina">
<text>Pikeville is a town in Wayne County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 678 at the 2010 census. It is included in the Goldsboro, North Carolina Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is notable for being the home of Collier Motors, an automobile sales and service business established in 1955 that has remained an American Motors (AMC) dealership.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

==History==

===Early history===
Torhunta was a large Native American farming community in present-day northern. The Native Americans left North Carolina and returned to their home in New York where they became members of the Iroquois Nation. After the Native Americans left the area, there was an influx of settlers who came into the rich Neuse River lands and began to clear plantations. Many of these settlers were of the Religious Society of Friends, also known as Quakers.

Samuel Pike moved to the area and settled on the south side of Nahunta Swamp which had been granted by King George II of Great Britain in 1763. This grant of land included between 2,500 and . In 1785, Pike deeded most of this land to his only son Nathan. It was this Nathan Pike for whom the township, the Post Office, and later the town was named.

Nathan Pike owned and operated a large tavern, shop, trading post and hotel. It was then known as Pike’s Junction. In 1856, the first post office opened. During the period of 1793 to 1835 Pike sold around of his land to other families who came here to settle.

=== Civil War ===
During General Sherman’s Carolinas campaign in 1865, Pikeville suffered the same fate of many southern towns. Union soldiers destroyed the hotel and tavern Nathan Pike had built, and many buildings and homes were damaged or destroyed. Some of General Sherman’s forces camped in areas east of Pikeville during this time.

===Turn of the century===
The first school in the area was located at a crossroads named Mount Carmel in 1865. In 1908, the Pikeville grade school was made Pikeville High School. It was composed of the schools of Mount Carmel, Sherrad’s Cross Roads, Pleasant Grove, Oak Dale, Possum Trot, Taylor’s Oak Grove, Smith’s Patetown as well as Pikeville grade School. In 1960, Charles B. Aycock High School was opened in Pikeville in honor of the state governor who was an advocate for quality education.

<doc id="128362" wikidata="Q81170" url="?curid=128362" title="Oriel College, Oxford">
<text>Oriel College () is a constituent college of the University of Oxford in Oxford, England. Located in Oriel Square, the college has the distinction of being the oldest royal foundation in Oxford (a title formerly claimed by University College, whose claim of being founded by King Alfred is no longer promoted). In recognition of this royal connection, the college has also been historically known as King&#x27;s College and King&#x27;s Hall. The reigning monarch of the United Kingdom (since 2022, Charles III) is the official visitor of the college.

The original medieval foundation established in 1324 by Adam de Brome, under the patronage of King Edward II of England, was the House of the Blessed Mary at Oxford, and the college received a royal charter in 1326. In 1329, an additional royal grant of a manor house, La Oriole, eventually gave rise to its common name. The first design allowed for a provost and ten fellows, called &quot;scholars&quot;, and the college remained a small body of graduate fellows until the 16th century, when it started to admit undergraduates. During the English Civil War, Oriel played host to high-ranking members of the king&#x27;s Oxford Parliament.

The main site of the college incorporates four medieval halls: Bedel Hall, St Mary Hall, St Martin Hall, and Tackley&#x27;s Inn, the last being the oldest standing medieval hall in Oxford. The college has nearly 40 fellows, about 300 undergraduates and some 250 graduates. Oriel was the last of Oxford&#x27;s men&#x27;s colleges to admit women, doing so in 1985 after more than six centuries as an all-male institution. Today, however, the student body has almost equal numbers of men and women. Oriel&#x27;s notable alumni include two Nobel laureates; prominent fellows have included founders of the Oxford Movement. Among Oriel&#x27;s more notable possessions are a painting by Bernard van Orley and three pieces of medieval silver plate. , the college was ranked twentieth in academic performance out of thirty colleges in the Norrington Table, having topped the table in 2015–16.

== History ==
=== Middle Ages ===
On 24 April 1324, the Rector of the University Church, Adam de Brome, obtained a licence from King Edward II to found a &quot;certain college of scholars studying various disciplines in honour of the Virgin&quot; and to endow it to the value of £30 a year. Brome bought two properties in 1324, Tackley&#x27;s Hall, on the south side of the High Street, and Perilous Hall, on the north side of Broad Street, and as an investment, he also purchased the advowson of a church in Aberford.
Brome&#x27;s foundation was confirmed in a charter dated 21 January 1326, in which the Crown, represented by the Lord Chancellor, was to exercise the rights of Visitor; a further charter drawn up in May of that year gave the rights of Visitor to Henry Burghersh, Bishop of Lincoln, as Oxford at that time was part of the diocese of Lincoln. Under Edward&#x27;s patronage, Brome diverted the revenues of the University Church to his college, which thereafter was responsible for appointing the Vicar and providing four chaplains to celebrate the daily services in the church. The college lost no time in seeking royal favour again after Edward II&#x27;s deposition, and Edward III confirmed his father&#x27;s favour in February 1327, but the amended statutes with the Bishop of Lincoln as Visitor remained in force. In 1329, the college received by royal grant a large house belonging to the Crown, known as La Oriole, on the site of what is now First Quad. It is from this property that the college acquired its common name, &quot;Oriel&quot;; the name was in use from about 1349. The word referred to an &quot;oratoriolum&quot;, or oriel window, forming a feature of the earlier property.

In the early 1410s several fellows of Oriel took part in the disturbances accompanying Archbishop Arundel&#x27;s attempt to stamp out Lollardy in the university; the Lollard belief that religious power and authority came through piety and not through the hierarchy of the Church particularly inflamed passions in Oxford, where its proponent, John Wycliffe, had been head of Balliol. Disregarding the provost&#x27;s authority, Oriel&#x27;s fellows fought bloody battles with other scholars, killed one of the Chancellor&#x27;s servants when they attacked his house, and were prominent among the group that obstructed the Archbishop and ridiculed his censures.

In 1442, Henry VI sanctioned an arrangement whereby the town was to pay the college £25 a year from the fee farm (a type of feudal tax) in exchange for decayed property, allegedly worth £30 a year, which the college could not afford to keep in repair. The arrangement was cancelled in 1450.

=== Early Modern ===
In 1643, a general obligation was imposed on Oxford colleges to support the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. The King called for Oriel&#x27;s plate, and almost all of it was given, the total weighing . of gilt, and . of &quot;white&quot; plate. In the same year the college was assessed at £1 of the weekly sum of £40 charged on the colleges and halls for the fortification of the city. When the Oxford Parliament was assembled during the Civil War in 1644, Oriel housed the executive committee of the Privy Council, Parliament being held at neighbouring Christ Church. Following the defeat of the Royalist cause, the university was scrutinised by the Parliamentarians, and five of the eighteen Oriel fellows were removed. The Visitors, on their own authority, elected fellows between 1648 and October 1652, when without reference to the Commissioners, John Washbourne was chosen; the autonomy of the college in this respect seems to have been restored.

In 1673 James Davenant, a fellow since 1661, complained to William Fuller, then Bishop of Lincoln, about Provost Say&#x27;s conduct in the election of Thomas Twitty to a fellowship. Bishop Fuller appointed a commission that included the Vice-Chancellor, Peter Mews; the Dean of Christ Church, John Fell; and the Principal of Brasenose, Thomas Yates. On 1 August Fell reported to the Bishop that:
When this Devil of buying and selling is once cast out, your Lordship will, I hope, take care that he return not again, lest he bring seven worse than himself into the house after &#x27;tis swept and garnisht.
On 24 January 1674, Bishop Fuller issued a decree dealing with the recommendations of the commissioners—a majority of all the fellows should always be present at an election, so the provost could not push an election in a thin meeting, and fellows should be admitted immediately after their election. On 28 January Provost Say obtained from the King a recommendation for Twitty&#x27;s election, but it was withdrawn on 13 February, following the Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s refusal to swear Twitty into the university and the Bishop&#x27;s protests at Court.
During the early 1720s, a constitutional struggle began between the provost and the fellows, culminating in a lawsuit. In 1721, Henry Edmunds was elected as a fellow by 9 votes to 3; his election was rejected by Provost George Carter, and on appeal, by the Visitor, Edmund Gibson, then Bishop of Lincoln. The provost continued to reject candidates, fuelling discontent among the fellows, until a writ of attachment against the Bishop of Lincoln was heard between 1724 and 1726. The opposing fellows, led by Edmunds, appealed to the original statutes, claiming the Crown as Visitor, making Gibson&#x27;s decisions invalid; Provost Carter, supported by Bishop Gibson, appealed to the second version, claiming the Bishop of Lincoln as Visitor. The jury decided for the fellows, supporting the original charter of Edward II.

In a private printing of 1899, Provost Shadwell lists thirteen Gaudies observed by the college during the 18th century; by the end of the 19th century all but two, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception and the Purification of the Virgin, had ceased to be celebrated.

=== Modern ===
In the early 19th century, the reforming zeal of Provosts John Eveleigh and Edward Copleston gained Oriel a reputation as the most brilliant college of the day. It was the centre of the &quot;Oriel Noetics&quot; — clerical liberals such as Richard Whately and Thomas Arnold were fellows, and during the 1830s, two intellectually eminent fellows of Oriel, John Keble and Saint John Henry Newman, supported by Canon Pusey (also an Oriel fellow initially, later at Christ Church) and others, formed a group known as the Oxford Movement, alternatively as the Tractarians, or familiarly as the Puseyites. The group was disgusted by the then Church of England and sought to revive the spirit of early Christianity. Tension arose in college since Provost Edward Hawkins was a determined opponent of the Movement.

During the First World War, a wall was built dividing Third Quad from Second Quad to accommodate members of Somerville College in St Mary&#x27;s Hall while their college buildings were being used as a military hospital. At that time Oxford separated male and female students as far as possible; Vera Brittain, one of the Somerville students, recalled an amusing occurrence during her time there in her autobiography, &quot;Testament of Youth&quot;:

In 1985, the college became the last all-male college in Oxford to start to admit women for matriculation as undergraduates. In 1984, the Senior Common Room voted 23–4 to admit women undergraduates from 1986. The Junior Common Room president believed that &quot;the distinctive character of the college will be undermined&quot;.

A second feast day was added in 2007 by a benefaction from George Moody, formerly of Oriel, to be celebrated on or near St George&#x27;s Day (23 April). The only remaining gaudy had then been Candlemas; the new annual dinner was to be known as the St. George&#x27;s Day Gaudy. The dinner is black tie and gowns, and by request of the benefactor, the main course will normally be goose.

== Buildings and environs ==
=== First Quad (Front Quad) ===

The Oriel Street site was acquired between 1329 and 1392. Nothing survives of the original buildings, La Oriole and the smaller St Martin&#x27;s Hall in the south-east; both were demolished before the quadrangle was built in the artisan mannerist style during the 17th century. The south and west ranges and the gate tower were built around 1620 to 1622; the north and east ranges and the chapel buildings date from 1637 to 1642. The façade of the east range forms a classical E shape comprising the college chapel, hall and undercroft. The exterior and interior of the ranges are topped by an alternating pattern of decorative gables. The gate house has a Perpendicular portal and canted Gothic oriel windows, with fan vaulting in the entrance. The room above has a particularly fine plaster ceiling and chimney piece of stucco caryatids and panelling interlaced with studded bands sprouting into large flowers.
==== Hall ====
In the centre of the east range, the portico of the hall entrance commemorates its construction during the reign of Charles I with the legend , &#x27;Charles, being king&#x27;, in capital letters in pierced stonework. The portico was completely rebuilt in 1897, and above it are statues of two kings: Edward II, the college&#x27;s founder, on the left, and probably either Charles I or James I, although this is disputed; above those is a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, after whom the college is officially named. The top breaks the Jacobean tradition and has classical pilasters, a shield with garlands, and a segmental pediment.

The hall has a hammerbeam roof and a louvre in the centre, which was originally the means of escape for smoke rising from a fireplace in the centre of the floor. The wooden panelling was designed by Ninian Comper and was erected in 1911 in place of some previous 19th-century Gothic type, though even earlier panelling, dating from 1710, is evident in the buttery.

Behind the high table is a portrait of Edward II; underneath is a longsword brought to the college in 1902 after being preserved for many years on one of the college&#x27;s estates at Swainswick, near Bath. On either side are portraits of Sir Walter Raleigh and Joseph Butler. The other portraits around the hall include other prominent members of Oriel such as Matthew Arnold, Thomas Arnold, James Anthony Froude, John Keble, John Henry Newman, Richard Whately and John Robinson. In 2002, the college commissioned one of the largest portraits of Queen Elizabeth II, measuring , from Jeff Stultiens to hang in the hall; the painting was unveiled the following year.
The stained glass in the windows display the coats of arms of benefactors and distinguished members of the college; three of the windows were designed by Ninian Comper. The window next to the entrance on the east side contains the arms of Regius Professors of Modern History who have been &quot;ex officio&quot; fellows of the college.

==== Chapel ====
The current chapel is Oriel&#x27;s third, the first being built around 1373 on the north side of First Quadrangle. By 1566, the chapel was located on the south side of the quadrangle, as shown in a drawing made for Elizabeth I&#x27;s visit to Oxford in that year. The present building was consecrated in 1642 and despite subsequent restorations it largely retains its original appearance.

The bronze lectern was given to the college in 1654. The black and white marble paving dates from 1677 to 1678. Except for the pews on the west, dating from 1884, the panelling, stalls and screens are all 17th-century, as are the altar and carved communion rails. Behind the altar is the oil-on-panel painting &quot;The Carrying of the Cross&quot;, also titled &quot;Christ Falls, with the Cross, before a City Gate&quot;, by the Flemish Renaissance painter Bernard van Orley. A companion piece to the painting is in the National Gallery of Scotland. The organ case dates from 1716; originally designed by Christopher Schreider for St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington, it was acquired by Oriel in 1884.
Above the entrance to the chapel is an oriel that, until the 1880s, was a room on the first floor that formed part of a set of rooms that were occupied by Richard Whately, and later by Saint John Henry Newman. Whately is said to have used the space as a larder and Newman is said to have used it for his private prayers – when the organ was installed in 1884, the space was used for the blower. The wall that once separated the room from the ante-chapel was removed, making it accessible from the chapel. The organ was built by J. W. Walker &amp; Sons in 1988; in 1991 the space behind the organ was rebuilt as an oratory and memorial to Newman and the Oxford Movement. A new stained-glass window designed by Vivienne Haig and realised by Douglas Hogg was completed and installed in 2001.

During the late 1980s, the chapel was extensively restored with the assistance of donations from Lady Norma Dalrymple-Champneys. During this work, the chandelier, given in 1885 by Provost Shadwell while still a fellow, was put back in place, the organ was restored, the painting mounted behind the altar, and the chapel repainted. A list of former chaplains and organ scholars was erected in the ante-chapel.

=== Second Quad (Back Quad) ===

Originally a garden, the demand for more accommodation for undergraduates in the early 18th century resulted in two free-standing blocks being built. The first block erected was the Robinson Building on the east side, built in 1720 by Bishop Robinson at the suggestion of his wife, as the inscription over the door records. Its twin block, the Carter Building, was erected on the west side in 1729, as a result of a benefaction by Provost Carter. The two buildings stood for nearly a hundred years as detached blocks in the garden, and the architectural elements of First Quad are repeated on them — only here the seven gables are all alike. Between 1817 and 1819, they were joined up to First Quad with their present, rather incongruous connecting links. In the link to the Robinson Building, two purpose-built rooms have been incorporated – the Champneys Room, designed by Weldon Champneys, the nephew of Basil Champneys, and the Benefactors Room, a panelled room honouring benefactors of the college. A Gothic oriel window, belonging to the provost&#x27;s lodgings, was added to the Carter Building in 1826.

The north range houses the library and senior common rooms; designed in the Neoclassical style by James Wyatt, it was built between 1788 and 1796 to accommodate the books requested by Edward, Baron Leigh, formerly High Steward of the university and an Orielensis, whose gift had doubled the size of the library. The two-storey building has rusticated arches on the ground floor and a row of Ionic columns above, dividing the façade into seven bays — the ground floor contains the first purpose-built senior common rooms in Oxford, above is the library.

On 7 March 1949, a fire spread from the library roof; over 300 printed books and the manuscripts on exhibition were completely destroyed, and over 3,000 books needed repair, though the main structure suffered little damage and restoration took less than a year.

=== Third Quad (St Mary&#x27;s Quad) ===
The south, east and west ranges of Third Quadrangle contain elements of St Mary Hall, which was incorporated into Oriel in 1902; less than a decade later, the Hall&#x27;s buildings on the northern side were demolished for the construction of the Rhodes Building. Bedel Hall in the south was formally amalgamated with St Mary Hall in 1505.

In the south range, parts of the medieval buildings survive and are incorporated into staircase ten — the straight, steep flight of stairs and timber-framed partitions date from a mid-15th century rebuilding of St Mary Hall. The former Chapel, Hall and Buttery of St Mary Hall, built in 1640, form part of the Junior Library and Junior Common Room. Viewed from Third Quad, the chapel, with its Gothic windows, can be seen to have been built neatly on top of the Hall, a unique example in Oxford of such a plan.

On the east side of the quad is a simple rustic style timber-frame building; known as &quot;the Dolls&#x27; House&quot;, it was erected by Principal King in 1743.

In 1826 an ornate range was erected by St Mary Hall in the Gothic Revival style, incorporating the old gate of St Mary Hall, on the west side of the quad. Designed by Daniel Robertson, it contains two quite ornate oriels placed asymmetrically, one is of six lights, the other four. They are the best example of the pre-archaeological Gothic in Oxford. The large oriel on the first floor at the north end was once the drawing room window of the Principal of the Hall. Parts of the street wall incorporated into this range show traces of blocked windows dating from the same period of rebuilding in the 15th century as the present-day staircase ten.
The Rhodes Building, pictured, was built in 1911 using £100,000 left to the college for that purpose by former student Cecil Rhodes. It was designed by Basil Champneys and stands on the site of the house of the St Mary Hall Principal, on the High Street. Champneys&#x27;s first proposal for the building included an open arcade to the High Street, a domed central feature and balustraded parapet. The left hand block and much of the centre was to be given up to a new provost&#x27;s lodging, and the five windows on the first floor above the arcade were to light a gallery belonging to the lodging. The college eventually decided to retain the existing provost&#x27;s lodging and demanded detailing &quot;more in accordance with the style which has become traditional in Oxford&quot;. It became the last building of the Jacobean revival style in Oxford.

The staircases of the interior façade are decorated with cartouches similar to those found in First Quad, and likewise bear the arms of important figures in the college&#x27;s history; (13) Sir Walter Raleigh who was an undergraduate from 1572 to 1574, (14) John Keble who was a fellow between 1811 and 1835, (archway) Edward Hawkins who was provost from 1828 until 1882 and (15) Gilbert White who was an undergraduate from 1739 until 1743 and a fellow from 1744 until 1793.

The building was not entirely well received; William Sherwood, Mayor of Oxford and Master of Magdalen College School, wrote: &quot;Oriel [has] broken out into the High, ... destroying a most picturesque group of old houses in so doing, and, to put it gently, hardly compensating us for their removal.&quot;

====Statue of Cecil Rhodes====

On the side facing the High Street, there is a statue of Oriel graduate Cecil Rhodes over the main entrance, with Edward VII and George V beneath. These formed part of a group of seven statues commissioned for the building from the sculptor Henry Pegram. The inscription reads: &quot;&quot;, which, as well as acknowledging Rhodes&#x27;s munificence, is a chronogram giving the date of construction, 1911.

The statue has been the subject of protests for several years in the wake of the Rhodes Must Fall movement in 2015. Hundreds of protestors again demanded its removal in June 2020, in the wake of the removal of the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol a few days previously. The statues had been targeted during the protests that arose following the murder of George Floyd in the United States. On 20 May 2021, however, the college decided not to remove the statue despite the majority of members of a commission to decide its future recommending removal; Oriel College cited costs and &quot;complex&quot; planning procedures. Roughly 150 Oxford lecturers stated they will not teach Oriel students more than is required in their contracts in protest at the decision to keep the statue.

=== Island Site (O&#x27;Brien Quad) ===
This is a convex quadrilateral of buildings, bordered by the High Street, and the meeting of Oriel Street and King Edward Street in Oriel Square. The site took six hundred years to acquire and although it contains teaching rooms and the Harris Lecture Theatre, it is largely given over to accommodation.

On the High Street, No. 106 and 107 stand on the site of Tackley&#x27;s Inn; built around 1295, it was the first piece of property that Adam de Brome acquired when he began to found the college in 1324. It comprised a hall and chambers leased to scholars, behind a frontage of five shops, with the scholars above and a cellar of five bays below. The hall, which was open to the roof, was long, wide, and about high; at the east end was a large chamber with another chamber above it. The south wall of the building, which survives, was partly of stone and contains a large two-light early 14th-century window. The cellar below is of the same date and is the best preserved medieval cellar in Oxford; originally entered by stone steps from the street, it has a stone vault divided into four sections by two diagonal ribs, with carved corbels.

No. 12 Oriel Street, now staircases 19 and 20, is the oldest tenement acquired by the college; known as Kylyngworth&#x27;s, it was granted to the college in 1392 by Thomas de Lentwardyn, fellow and later provost, having previously been let to William de Daventre, Oriel&#x27;s fourth provost, in 1367. A back wing to the property was added around 1600 and further work to the front was conducted in 1724–1738. In 1985, funded by a gift from Edgar O&#x27;Brien and £10,000 from the Pilgrim Trust, Kylyngworth&#x27;s was refurbished along with Nos. 10, 9 and 7.
King Edward Street was created by the college between 1872 and 1873 when 109 and 110 High Street were demolished. The old shops on each side of the road were pulled down and rebuilt, and to preserve the continuity, the new shops were numbered 108 and 109–112. Named after the college&#x27;s founder, the road was opened in 1873. On the wall of the first floor of No. 6, there is a large metal plaque with a portrait of Cecil Rhodes; underneath is the inscription:
In this house, the Rt. Hon Cecil John Rhodes kept academical residence in the year 1881. This memorial is erected by Alfred Mosely in recognition of the great services rendered by Cecil Rhodes to his country.

In the centre of the quad is the Harris Building, formerly Oriel court, a real tennis court where Charles I played tennis with his nephew Prince Rupert in December 1642 and King Edward VII had his first tennis lesson in 1859. The building was in use as a lecture hall by 1923, and after modernisation between 1991 and 1994, funded by Sir Philip and Lady Harris, contains accommodation, a seminar room and the college&#x27;s main lecture theatre. The bronze plaque in the lobby commemorates his father, Captain Charles William Harris, after whom the building is named. The building was opened by John Major, then Prime Minister, on 10 August 1993.

=== Rectory Road ===
Bordered by the Cowley Road, this site was formerly Nazareth House, a residential care home convent — Goldie Wing (shown left) and Larmenier House are its surviving buildings. Nazareth House itself was demolished to make room for two purpose-built halls of residence, James Mellon Hall (shown right) and David Paterson House. The two new halls were opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 8 November 2000.

As it is about ten minutes&#x27; walk from college and more peaceful than the middle of the city, it has become the principal choice of accommodation for Oriel&#x27;s graduates and finalists. The site has its own common rooms, squash court, gymnasium and support staff.

=== Bartlemas ===
Bartlemas is a conservation area that incorporates the remaining buildings of a leper hospital founded by Henry I; it includes the sports grounds for Oriel, Jesus and Lincoln Colleges, along with landscaping for wildlife and small scale urban development.

In 1326 Provost Adam de Brome was appointed warden of St Bartholomew&#x27;s; a leper hospital in Cowley Marsh, the hospital was later granted to the college by Edward III, along with the payments it had been receiving from the fee farm. It was increasingly used as a rest house for sick members of the college needing a change of air. In 1649 the college rebuilt the main hospital range north of the chapel, destroyed in the Civil War, as a row of four almshouses, called Bartlemas House. Bartlemas Chapel and two farm cottages are the other extant buildings.

=== Filming location ===
The buildings of Oriel College were used as a location for Hugh Grant&#x27;s first film, &quot;Privileged&quot; (1982), as well as &quot;Oxford Blues&quot; (1984), &quot;True Blue&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Dinosaur Hunter&quot; (2000). The television crime series &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; used the college in the episodes &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; (under the name of &quot;Courtenay College&quot;), &quot;The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn&quot;, &quot;The Infernal Serpent&quot;, &quot;Deadly Slumber&quot;, &quot;Twilight of the Gods&quot; and &quot;Death is now My Neighbour&quot;, and in the one-off follow on, &quot;Lewis&quot;, the Middle Common Room and Oriel Square were used.

== Heraldry ==

The college&#x27;s coat of arms are blazoned: &quot;Gules, three lions passant guardant or within a bordure engrailed argent&quot;. In recognition of Oriel&#x27;s foundation by King Edward II, the arms are based on the royal arms of England, which also feature three lions, with a bordure added as a mark of difference.

The Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers, often adopted as insignia by members of the college, appear as decorative elements within the college buildings and appear on the official college tie. It probably represents Edward, the Black Prince, Prince of Wales, who first adopted the device, the senior grandson of King Edward II, although it may represent King Charles I, who was Prince of Wales when the building of First Quad began in the 17th century.

In 2009, the College of Arms granted the college the use of a heraldic badge, particularly for the boat club and the Tortoise Club, a society of college rowing alumni. The badge is blazoned: &quot;A tortoise displayed the shell circular azure charged with two concentric annulets argent&quot;.

== Prayer and graces ==
One of the following two college prayers is recited by the provost or the senior fellow present at the conclusion of Evensong on Sundays and other services:

A full list of benefactors is read out on certain occasions, including Commemoration Sunday and at services before gaudies.

Before Formal Hall, the following Latin &quot;ante cibum&quot; grace is recited by a student Bible clerk. The translation is reputedly by Erasmus in his &quot;Convivium Religiosum&quot; of a grace recorded by Saint John Chrysostom:

After the meal, the provost or the presiding fellow may recite a short Latin prayer (; &#x27;Let praise be given to/by the Blessed One, though Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen&#x27;) instead of the following full &quot;post cibum&quot; grace:

== Student life ==

Accommodation is provided for all undergraduates, and for some graduates, though some accommodation is off-site. Members are generally expected to dine in hall, where there are two sittings every evening, Informal Hall and Formal Hall, except on Saturdays, where there are no sittings.

Between 2001 and 2010, Oriel students chose not to be affiliated to the Oxford University Student Union. In a 2010 student referendum, the junior common room decided to re-affiliate. However, in 2013, in a fresh referendum, the Oriel JCR again voted to disaffiliate from OUSU.

=== Arts ===
Oriel has its own drama society, the Oriel Lions, which funds college and Oxford University shows.

The college also has its own student-run publication, &quot;The Poor Print&quot;, which publishes a range of content, including news, poetry, photography, science, comment, drawing, music, events and entertainment. Each issue is based around a theme, decided upon by the editors, and content comes from members of all common rooms and the college staff. Originally set up in 2013, the publication in its current guise was established in Michaelmas 2014 as an online-only magazine, with a fortnightly print edition then introduced in 2015.

=== Sport ===
Croquet may be played in St Mary quad in the summer, as can bowls on the south lawn of First Quad. The sports ground at Bartlemas is used for a variety of sports.

==== Rowing ====

Rowing at the college is run by the Oriel College Boat Club, carried out from the college&#x27;s own boat house near Christ Church Meadow. Oriel has had a reputation for its success in rowing, in particular the two intercollegiate bumps races, Torpids and Eights Week.

As of 2018, Oriel holds 33 Torpids men&#x27;s headships, the most of any college. It also holds 32 Summer Eights Headships, second to Christ Church, at 33; from 1968 to 2018, Oriel won 25 headships. In 2006, Oriel claimed the first ever double headship in Torpids, rowing over as Head of the River in both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s first divisions. In 2018, the college repeated this victory with their second double headship. It remains the only college to have achieved a double headship in Torpids.

In addition to the Oxford-based races, Oriel crews compete in external events including the Head of the River Race, the Women&#x27;s Eights Head of the River Race, the Henley Boat Races and regional events. In 2016 the men&#x27;s first boat won the men&#x27;s eights collegiate event at the Fairbairn Cup, it won again in 2017 and won the entire event in 2018.

In &quot;Tom Brown at Oxford&quot; by Thomas Hughes, Oriel&#x27;s win in the 1842 Head of the River Race, with Oriel bumping Trinity, was re-written as Brown&#x27;s college &quot;St Ambrose&quot; taking first place, with &quot;Oriel&quot; in second place.

== Associated people ==

Oriel has produced many notable alumni, from statesmen and cricketers to industrialists; a notable undergraduate in the 16th century was Sir Walter Raleigh, an explorer during the Age of Discovery. At the graduate level, the college boasts as former fellows the principal founders of the Oxford Movement: John Keble, Edward Bouverie Pusey, and John Henry Newman. The college has produced many other churchmen, bishops, cardinals, governors, and two Nobel Prize recipients: Alexander Todd (Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1957) and James Meade (Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, 1977).

The professorial fellowships held by the college are the Regius Professor of Modern History, currently held by Lyndal Roper; the Oriel and Laing Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture, currently held by Hindy Najman; the Nolloth Professor of the Philosophy of the Christian Religion, currently held by Mark Wynn; and the Nuffield Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

In the 1700s, Oriel attracted its first transatlantic students, sons of planters in the Colony of Virginia. One such student, Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, &quot;came to regret giving a job to a young surveyor: George Washington&quot;.

== Notable possessions ==
Oriel has three notable pieces of medieval plate. The first is a French beaker and cover in silver gilt; past estimates on its dating from 1460 to 1470 are thought mistaken, and circa 1350, with later decoration, was later expounded. It was bought in 1493 for £4.18&quot;s&quot;.1&quot;d&quot;., under the mistaken belief that it had belonged to Edward II. In a college inventory of plate dated 21 December 1596, it is named as the Founder&#x27;s Cup.

The second notable piece of plate is a mazer of maplewood with silver gilt mounts, dating from 1470 to 1485. On the edge of the rim is a row of grouped beads; below is an inscription in black letters:
:&quot;Vir racione vivas non quod petit atra voluptas sic caro casta datur lis lingue suppeditatur&quot;
:Man, in thy draughts let reason be thy guide, and not the craving of perverted lust;
:So honest nourishment will be supplied, and strife of tongue be trampled in the dust
This type of shallow drinking vessel was quite common in the Middle Ages, but the only other mazers in Oxford are three dating from the 15th century, and one standing mazer from 1529 to 1530, all belonging to All Souls. Third is a coconut cup, one of six in Oxford; the Oriel cup has silver gilt mounts and dates from the first quarter of the 16th century.

Among the later plate are two flagons, two patens and a chalice which date from 1640 to 1641. The larger pieces of Buttery Plate include the Sanford and Heywood grace cups, dated 1654–1655 and 1669–1670, a rosewater ewer gifted in 1669, a punchbowl dating from 1735 to 1736, and the great Wenman tankard presented in 1679, which holds a gallon and is the largest in Oxford. Many of the 17th- and 18th-century tankards were given by commensales and commoners as a form of an admission fee.

Oriel also possesses an engrossment of the Magna Carta.

<doc id="128366" wikidata="Q82606" url="?curid=128366" title="Pembroke College, Oxford">
<text>Pembroke College, a constituent college of the University of Oxford, is located on Pembroke Square, Oxford. The college was founded in 1624 by King James I of England and VI of Scotland, using in part the endowment of merchant Thomas Tesdale, and was named after William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, Lord Chamberlain and then-Chancellor of the University.

Like many Oxford colleges, Pembroke previously accepted men only, admitting its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979. As of 2020, Pembroke had an estimated financial endowment of £63 million. Pembroke College provides almost the full range of study available at Oxford University.

A former Senior President of Tribunals and Lord Justice of Appeal, Sir Ernest Ryder, has held the post of Master of Pembroke since 2020.

==History==
===Foundation and origins===
In 1610, Thomas Tesdale gave £5,000 on his death for the education of Abingdon School Scholars (seven fellows and six scholars) at Balliol College, Oxford. However, in 1623, this money was augmented by the Reverend Richard Wightwick, parish priest of East Ilsley, and used instead for the conversion of Broadgates Hall into Pembroke College. Broadgates Hall had been an academic hall for law students. The site of the hall was given to the Priory of St Frideswide by a Richard Segrim in 1254. The letters patent founding the college were signed by King James I in 1624, it being named after William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, Lord Chamberlain, Chancellor of the University, and rumoured patron of William Shakespeare.

===Coat of arms===
Pembroke College&#x27;s arms were granted on 14 February 1625, being blazoned by the Heralds&#x27; College:

:&quot;&quot;Per pale azure and gules, three lions rampant two and one argent, in a chief party per pale argent and or, in the first a rose gules seeded or barbed vert, in the second a thistle proper&quot;.&quot;

King James I and the Earl of Pembroke are both represented in the College&#x27;s arms: the former by the union of the crowns as James I of England and James VI of Scotland, depicted by the rose (of England) and the thistle (of Scotland); the latter using the three lions rampant and colours from the Pembroke family arms.

==Buildings==

===Old Quad===
Following its foundation, the college proceeded to expand around Broadgates, building what is now known as &quot;Old Quad&quot; in the 1600s. Built in stages through the seventeenth century out of the local Cotswold limestone, space restrictions saw the south-side of the Quad built directly on top of the old City Wall.

===Chapel Quad===
A Chapel was built in 1732, followed by the introduction of further accommodation in 1846 and the Hall in 1848 to designs by Exeter-based architect John Hayward, together creating &quot;Chapel Quad.&quot; The Chapel was designed and built by William Townsend, although the interior was dramatically revamped by Charles Kempe—a Pembroke graduate—in 1884. Pembroke alumnus Dr. Damon Wells was a significant benefactor of the college over many years: he funded the restoration of the Chapel in 1972 and again in the 1990s and provided ongoing support to the Chaplaincy and History Fellowship. The Chapel, which is still used for regular worship, now bears his name.

===North Quad===
Further expansion of the College came in the 1960s, after the closure of Beef Lane to the north of Chapel Quad. The private houses north of the closed road were acquired by the college in a piecemeal fashion and reversed so that access was only possible from the rear. The area is now known as &quot;North Quad&quot; and was formally opened in 1962.

===Rokos Quad===

In April 2013 HRH The Duke of Kent officially opened a new quadrangle named after the lead donor Chris Rokos The new buildings include a 170-seat multi-purpose auditorium, a new café, art gallery, and teaching and function rooms. The development is physically joined to the college&#x27;s existing city-centre site via a new bridge crossing Brewer Street and the original medieval city wall, and &#x27;landing&#x27; in the old Fellows&#x27; Garden adjacent to Chapel Quad. Having historically been one of the university&#x27;s dimensionally smaller colleges, following the opening of the new building, undergraduates are now able to live in college premises for all years of study. Postgraduates also benefit from more rooms, and there are six flats for those with partners.

===Geoffrey Arthur Building=== 
A modern annexe on the banks of the River Isis at Grandpont provides accommodation for around 115 graduates and 40 undergraduates of the college. Named the Geoffrey Arthur Building (commonly referred to as &quot;The GAB&quot;), the building is named after the diplomat Sir Geoffrey Arthur, Master of the College (1975–1985).

==Admissions==
Pembroke offers a broad range of courses, covering most subject areas offered by the university having a strong involvement with Economics, Languages, as well as Management Studies, being the first traditional Oxford college to elect a Fellow in the field. The college maintains a relationship with the Saïd Business School.

In March 2002 two Pembroke fellows resigned after allegations that they had offered a place to the fictional child of an undercover reporter in return for a donation to the college library; a journalist had taped a conversation where he posed as the father of a fictitious son.

Pembroke leads an educational Access initiative called OxNet, delivered in collaboration with other Oxford colleges and Higher Education institutions in addition to a national network of Hub and Link schools across West London, the North West and North East of England. OxNet runs a series of academic programmes for pupils from these target regions, aiming to raise educational aspiration and attainment and to widen access to the University of Oxford and other competitive universities, irrespective of a person&#x27;s background of location. Their programmes aim to challenge pupils to think beyond the curriculum, raise academic resilience and confidence, demystify preconceptions of Oxbridge and equip pupils with important skills for continued study.

==Student life==
===Junior and Middle Common Rooms===
Pembroke is home to a Junior Common Room (undergraduate community) notable for its artistic wealth and sporting prowess. The JCR is the wealthiest in Oxford due to the purchase and sale of a Francis Bacon painting in the mid 20th century; it was bought in 1953 for £150 and sold for £400,000 in 1997. The JCR has used those funds to support a student support scheme and an artistic acquisition programme.

===Sport===
In 2018, Pembroke became the first college to win two rugby honours in one year, with the women&#x27;s team winning Cuppers, and the men&#x27;s team winning the Cuppers Bowl.

Pembroke College Boat Club in 2013 held both the Torpids and Summer Eights men&#x27;s headship, with the women&#x27;s 1st boat sitting at 4th and 7th places respectively. In 2016, the men held Head of the River in Torpids and 4th in Summer Eights, and the women held 3rd and 2nd for Torpids and Summer Eights respectively. Pembroke Men&#x27;s 2nd Torpids also bumped five places up to 11th in Division 1—the first time there have been two men&#x27;s boats from a single college in over 40 years. Pembroke was the top club in aggregate points across all boats for three years running. In 2003, Pembroke became the first college to win the &quot;Double Headship Trophy&quot; for having both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Eights head the river. In 2018, the Pembroke Women&#x27;s 1st boat again achieved the Summer Eights headship.

==People associated with Pembroke==
===Notable people===

Samuel Johnson was one of the college&#x27;s more famous alumni, though he did not complete his degree (he was later awarded an honorary degree by the University); lack of funds forced him to leave Oxford after about a year and a half. Two of his desks and various other possessions are displayed around the college. He spoke fondly of Pembroke to his death, recalling especially the college&#x27;s many poets, telling friends that ‘we were a nest of singing birds.&#x27; James Smithson, whose bequest founded the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. (despite him never having visited the United States) was an undergraduate at Pembroke, under the name &quot;James Lewis Macie&quot;—he changed his name to that of his natural father after the death of his mother. In addition, Senator J. William Fulbright, who established the Fulbright Program, was a Rhodes Scholar at Pembroke in the 1920s.

In more recent years, Danielle Ivory, award winning journalist at the New York Times; Pete Buttigieg, US presidential candidate; and military historian Jonathan Fennell, have completed graduate degrees at Pembroke.

====Diplomacy====
Thomas Randolph, principal of Pembroke&#x27;s precursor mediaeval hall, Broadgates, served as ambassador for Elizabeth I to Scotland from 1559, where he gained the friendship of Mary, Queen of Scots, until he was accused of supporting the rebellion of James Stuart. In 1568 he was despatched to Moscow to secure trading rights from Ivan IV, also known as &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot;, gaining valuable access to Russia for English merchants of the Muscovy Company.

More recently, John, Baron Kerr of Kinlochard, served as HM Ambassador to the United States from 1995 to 1997, before being appointed Head of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Philip Lader served as US Ambassador to the UK from 1997 to 2001. Thus in 1997, both the US Ambassador in London and the UK Ambassador in Washington were former Pembroke students. Peter, Baron Ricketts was Head of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from 2006 until 2010, before serving as British Ambassador to France for six years until his retirement in 2016.

Additionally, two former chairmen of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Senator Richard G. Lugar, (Republican), and Senator J. William Fulbright (Democrat), were students of Pembroke, between them chairing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for a 27-year period.

From Europe, the Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orbán and Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski MEP studied at Pembroke, as too did the Sultan Haitham bin Tariq of Oman and King Abdullah II of Jordan.

<doc id="128370" wikidata="Q7261714" url="?curid=128370" title="Pusey House, Oxford">
<text>Pusey House () is an Anglican religious institution and charitable incorporated organisation located on St Giles&#x27;, Oxford, United Kingdom, immediately to the south of Pusey Street. It is firmly rooted in the Anglo-Catholic Prayer Book tradition of the Church of England and was founded in 1884 in memory of Edward Bouverie Pusey, Regius Professor of Hebrew at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement.

The house was established as a &quot;House of Piety of Learning&quot; with a library and chapel, both of which remain open and in use today. One of the original intentions of Pusey House was to house Pusey&#x27;s collection of books and, since its foundation, the house has come to possess many artifacts relating to Pusey and the Oxford Movement, with the house&#x27;s library and Archive holding one of the country&#x27;s most significant collections of material pertaining to Anglo-Catholicism. The house holds daily services in its chapel, as well as regular lectures and events.

Pusey House is closely associated with Oxford University, especially St Cross College which moved onto the Pusey House site in 1981, but is not itself a permanent private hall or constituent college.

==History==
Pusey Memorial House was opened on 9 October 1884 as a memorial to Edward Bouverie Pusey, Regius Professor of Hebrew at Oxford University, a canon of Christ Church Cathedral and for 40 years a leading figure in the Oxford Movement, a movement of the mid-19th century which sought to bring the Church of England to a deeper understanding of its witness as part of the universal (&quot;Catholic&quot;) church. It was also intended to continue the work of Pusey in restoring the Church of England&#x27;s Catholic life and witness. It was established with a fund of £50,000 to provide a building for Pusey&#x27;s library, purchase it and create an endowment so that two or more clergy could take charge of it and promote religious life in the university. The first principal was Charles Gore, who founded the Community of the Resurrection at the house in 1892. The Community moved to Mirfield (where it remains) when Gore resigned as Principal in 1897.

The house flourished in the following years and came to experiment with forms of quasi-monastic life. Vincent Stuckey Stratton Coles, principal from 1897 to 1909, later recorded that &quot;for a moment it seemed as if the Pusey House was trying to become a monastery. Silence was observed at dinner on Fridays. Great regularity of attendance at the chapel offices, and regulations as to the times of retirement and rising, began to be practised.&quot; Coles had been the first priest librarian along with F. E. Brightman when Gore was principal. Edward King, Bishop of Lincoln, famously quipped that &quot;Brightman would dust the books, Gore would read them, and Coles would talk about them.&quot;

During the principalship of Darwell Stone, a new building was commissioned which was eventually designed by Temple Moore, a leading Anglo-Catholic architect of his time. The house continued its work as the centre of Anglo-Catholicism in Oxford in the new buildings, attracting undergraduates including John Betjeman and Harold Macmillan.

Since 1981, a portion of the Pusey House site has been occupied by St Cross College on a 999-year lease.

==Buildings==
From 1884 until 1912, Pusey House occupied two townhouses on St Giles&#x27; on the site of the current building. Following a 1903 benefaction of £70,000 from a Leeds solicitor, John Cudworth, and with a growing ministry to the university, Pusey House was able to consider rebuilding. In 1910, the governors took advantage of the falling in of a lease at a neighbouring townhouse which was subsequently bought and demolished to make way for the new buildings.The principal at the time, Darwell Stone, requested that the new building should include a chapel &quot;of good and simple architecture to hold about 200 and a side chapel to hold about thirty&quot; alongside lecture rooms, domestic ranges, a library, and museum. Four architects were approached to submit designs: Harold Brakspear, Walter Tapper, Giles Gilbert Scott, and Temple Moore.

After inspecting the four proposals the building committee chose Moore&#x27;s designs, formally appointing him as architect in October 1911.

Moore designed a large Gothic building around a quadrangle, its centrepiece being the two vaulted chapels separated by a stone pulpitum which he based on those found in &#x27;medieval Franciscan priories&#x27;. The chapel and part of the library were complete by 1914, and most of the remaining portions of the building were finished in 1918. The south range of the quadrangle remained unexecuted at the time of Moore&#x27;s death in 1920, and was only finished in 1925 to sympathetic designs by John Coleridge.

The smaller Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament was reordered between 1935 and 1939 by Sir Ninian Comper. Comper&#x27;s work in the chapel included the construction of a gilded baldacchino surmounted by the resurrected Christ and attendant angels, and the stained glass in the east window. In the east window, Comper depicted a Tree of Jesse commemorating Pusey. The window contains figures of Old Testament prophets and Church Fathers surrounding Christ in Majesty and the Virgin and Child. The figure of Pusey can be seen, kneeling at the base of the second light from the right. Comper also designed vestments for Pusey House, and specially designed his &quot;strawberry&quot; pattern for the chapel.

==Library ==
The library is a theological and historical collection of 75,000 volumes which includes Pusey&#x27;s library and a large collection of other theological and historical volumes. Pusey&#x27;s own books, bought after his death, originally formed the heart of Pusey House Library. Since then, by gift and purchase, the library has grown into a collection which has been recognised by the National Archives as a leading specialist library not only in Oxford but in the United Kingdom. In addition to its primary source material and books on the Anglo-Catholic Movement (Tractarian and Oxford movements), the library also has collections of material for the study of patristics, church history, liturgy, doctrine, monasticism and Anglican Catholic organisations.

The archive contains extensive material on the Tractarians and the Oxford Movement: the records of a number of Anglo-Catholic societies; communities of monks and nuns; letters and papers of notable Anglicans, as well as the archive of Pusey himself. 
The manuscripts include papers of many notable figures, organisations and societies connected with the Oxford Movement in the 19th and 20th centuries. The most significant holdings are those of E. B. Pusey, H. P. Liddon, and S. L. Ollard, but there are also papers relating to other notable people such as William Ewart Gladstone, John Henry Newman, Frederic Hood, F. L. Cross, and John Keble.

==Worship==
Worship in the Chapel of the Resurrection is in accordance with the Anglo-Catholic tradition in the Church of England and is open to all, especially to members of the university. Alongside its reputation for dignified and traditional liturgy, Pusey House is also recognised for its musical tradition, most visible at the Solemn Mass on Sundays and solemnities. 

===Services and observances===
* Compline each Tuesday evening during full term
* Low Mass daily during full term, with a BCP celebration on Fridays
* Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer, daily during full term
* Solemn High Mass every Sunday and on major festivals during full term with the Ordinary of the Mass sung by the choir

==Music==
The Choir of Pusey House is formed of eight choral scholars, largely students who are or recently have been members of college chapel choirs from across the University. The choir is responsible for singing at term-time Sundays (0-9th week), some weekday feasts, and other out of term services such as occasional evensongs, carol services and services through Holy Week.

Most Sundays, the choir will sing a polyphonic mass setting (which in Lent and Advent is normally replaced with plainsong) and an anthem, plainsong propers as well as support the hymns and congregationally sung Gloria and Creed. The choir&#x27;s repertoire is made up of predominantly chant, Renaissance polyphony, such as that by Byrd, Tallis and Lassus, as well as later Romantic and Modern composers of English church music, Stanford, Bairstow, and Peter Tranchell. Occasionally, the choir performs works by continental 19th and 20th century composers such as Vierne and Duruflé. Pusey House commissioned a new mass setting for its 125th anniversary celebrations from the composer Alexander Campkin. Another House commission is a setting of the Hæc Dies for Easter Day by Sydney Watson. 

In the past, the choir has recorded several CDs. Service music in the vacation is provided by a cantor or by musicians from the congregation often with support from members of the regular choir. 

One musical highlight of the year is the choral Communion on the feast of Charles, King and Martyr according to the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. This service normally features Tudor and Jacobean and Early English Baroque music works, and choral responses to the Commandments. 

The choir takes part in the &quot;Pusey Goes to London&quot; trips that take place every few years, often in All Saints, Margaret Street. This normally involves both current and former choir members. 

The House owns an Edwardian organ originally built by J.W. Walker for St. Paul&#x27;s, Slough in 1908. It was moved to the House in 2014 by Peter Collins. The House previously had an instrument by Rest Cartwright &amp; Son of two manuals and pedals that has since been removed. 

The current Master of Music is Ed Gaut. 

Pusey House regularly hosts concerts and rehearsals for several Oxford-based and student ensembles and choirs.

<text>Ruskin College, originally known as Ruskin Hall, Oxford, is a higher education institution and part of the University of West London, in Oxford, England. It is not a college of Oxford University. Named after the essayist, art and social critic John Ruskin, it specialises in providing educational opportunities for adults with few or no qualifications. Degrees taught at Ruskin were formerly awarded by the Open University. The college joined the University of West London in 2021.

== History ==
Ruskin Hall, Oxford, was established in 1899 to provide education for working-class men who could not access university. It was founded by Americans Charles A. Beard and Walter Vrooman, both of whom had studied at the University of Oxford. They placed the college in Oxford because the city symbolised the educational privilege and standards to which ordinary people could never previously have aspired. Vrooman&#x27;s wife, Amne (), an heiress, financially supported the foundation of the college.

The school was envisioned as a mechanism by which &quot;working-class reformers&quot; could &quot;educate themselves efficiently at nominal cost.&quot; Tuition, lodging, and board was priced at 12s 6d (£0.625) per week, with a parallel correspondence course alternatively offered for 1 shilling (£0.05) per week plus a 1 shilling entrance fee. Courses were offered in political economy, sociology, the history of the labour movement, principles of politics, English literature, psychology, and other related aspects of the social sciences.

The school was administered by a General Council, which included elected representatives from the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and the Central Board of the Cooperative Union. An auxiliary organisation of supporters of the school was launched in 1901, the Ruskin Hall Educational League, which arranged conferences and public lectures in conjunction with the activities of the school.

=== 20th century ===
In October 1907 Arthur Smith of Balliol College paid a visit to Ruskin College on behalf of some of his university colleagues. He broached the idea of bringing Ruskin closer to the University, suggesting that this would involve the University providing funds for the College, and allowing Ruskin students to join the University.The majority of Ruskin students were suspicious that the proposal would lead to the erosion of the college&#x27;s independence. Following a visit from Lord Curzon, the proposal was repeated and Dennis Hird, a lecturer in Sociology and Logic responded that as far as the students were concerned Ruskin College was irrevocably part of the Labour movement.

In 1908, a group of Ruskin students, dissatisfied with its education policy which they viewed as too pro-establishment and imbued with elements of &quot;social control&quot;, formed the Plebs&#x27; League. The students&#x27; revolt was supported by the Principal, Dennis Hird, and following his dismissal the students took strike action, refusing to attend lectures.

During the First World War, some of the two hundred Belgian refugees who came to Oxford were lodged in the college.

In 1970 Ruskin College hosted the UK&#x27;s first National Women&#x27;s Liberation Conference. The conference ran from 27 February to 1 March with between 500 and 600 people attending. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper called the conference the &quot;biggest landmarks in British women&#x27;s history&quot;. The conference organisers included Ruskin students Arielle Aberson and Sally Alexander, and historian Sheila Rowbotham. The organisers were associated with the History Workshop seminars held at the college and the conference was initially intended to focus on women&#x27;s history.

Ruskin College was a secular sister-school to and a model for the Roman Catholic-linked Plater College until Plater&#x27;s closing in 2005.

=== 2012 relocation ===
A £17m redevelopment programme of the college&#x27;s Old Headington site was completed in 2012, and the headquarters of the college moved there from the more central original site in Walton Street which was sold to Exeter College, Oxford. The redeveloped site has a new academic building incorporating an expanded library, named the Callaghan Library in honour of former Labour Prime Minister, James Callaghan, who made a major education speech at Ruskin in 1976. The MacColl / Seeger archive has a dedicated room within the new library. All other buildings on the site have been refurbished, the grounds have been improved and the walled garden, with its listed &#x27;crinkle crankle wall&#x27; has been brought back into use by local volunteers. A cafeteria is open to the public.

Around this time, parts of the college&#x27;s archives were controversially destroyed. The college asserted that it was legally required to dispose of the records because they contained personally identifying information.

=== 2021 merger ===
In February 2021 the college agreed to merge with Activate Learning. In May 2021 the College Principal was suspended. In August 2021 it was announced that the college had been acquired by the University of West London.

== Campus and buildings ==
The college is located in the Headington area of Oxford.

=== Libraries ===
In 2012 the college opened the Callaghan Library, named after former Prime Minister James Callaghan. Students are also able to access the Bodleian Library and others of the University of Oxford.

== Organisation and administration ==
The college is a part of the University of West London Group, and operates as a charity limited by guarantee. It is administered by a board of trustees.

=== College officials ===
The college is led by a Principal, currently Peter John CBE (as of 2024). He is supported by a Vice-Principal, currently Anthony Woodman.

== Student life ==
Student accommodation is provided through arrangement with local private providers.

=== Union and societies ===
The Ruskin College Students&#x27; Union provides student representation in the college.

In January 2013, the RSU joined a Unite Against Fascism protest at the Oxford Union when the Union invited Nick Griffin, the leader of the British National Party to speak. Notable former executive members of the RSU include John Prescott and Jack Ashley.

Students are also eligible to join the Oxford Union and other University of Oxford clubs and societies.

== Ruskin Fellowship ==

The Ruskin Fellowship is an alumni association for ex-Ruskin College students and staff. Independent of but associated with the college, the Fellowship aims to support the work and ethos of the college in offering university-level education to disadvantaged adults in Britain. There is also a post graduate programme and an international section involving: International Labour and Trade Union Studies; Webb and Chevening Scholars.

The Ruskin Fellowship was founded in the academic year 1911/1912 and held its first &quot;Annual Meet&quot; on 27 May 1912. This tradition continues with an Annual Reunion held in September of each year. The Reunion is held over a weekend and incorporates speakers on relevant topics, a social activity including a bar, music and a buffet and, on the Sunday morning of the Reunion weekend, the Fellowship&#x27;s Annual General Meeting (AGM). The AGM elects an executive committee to run the Fellowship for the following 12 months. A history of the Fellowship was produced in 2012 to mark the centenary of the Fellowship&#x27;s first &quot;Annual Meet&quot;.

A pamphlet on &quot;The History of the College and the Fellowship During World War One&quot; has been published as part of the commemoration of the War.

<text>The Queen&#x27;s College is a constituent college of the University of Oxford, England. The college was founded in 1341 by Robert de Eglesfield in honour of Philippa of Hainault, queen of England. It is distinguished by its predominantly neoclassical architecture, primarily dating from the 18th century.

In 2018, the college had an endowment of £291 million, making it the fourth-wealthiest Oxford college (after Christ Church, St. John&#x27;s, and All Souls).

== History ==

The college was founded in 1341 as &quot;Hall of the Queen&#x27;s scholars of Oxford&quot; by Robert de Eglesfield (d&#x27;Eglesfield), chaplain to the then queen consort Philippa of Hainault, after whom the hall was named. Robert&#x27;s aim was to provide clergymen for his native Cumberland and where he lived in Westmorland (both part of modern Cumbria). In addition, the college was to provide charity for the poor. The college&#x27;s coat of arms is that of the founder; it differs slightly from his family&#x27;s coat of arms, which did not include the gold star on the breast of the first eagle. The current coat of arms was adopted by d&#x27;Eglesfield because he was unable to use his family&#x27;s arms, being the younger son. D&#x27;Eglesfield had grand plans for the college, with a provost, 12 fellows studying theology, up to 13 chaplains, and 72 poor boys. However, the college did not have the funding to support such numbers, and initially had just two fellows.

The college gained land and patronage in the mid-15th century, giving it a good endowment and allowing it to expand to 10 fellows by the end of the century. By 1500, the college had started to take paying undergraduates, typically sons of the gentry and middle class, who paid the fellows for teaching. There were 14 of these in 1535; by 1612, this had risen to 194. The college added lectureships in Greek and philosophy. Provost Henry Robinson obtained an Act of Parliament incorporating the college as &quot;The Queen&#x27;s College&quot; in 1585, so Robinson is known as the second founder.

Following the new foundation, the college had a good reputation and flourished until the 1750s. Joseph Williamson, who had been admitted as a poor boy and went on to become a fellow, rose to Secretary of State and amassed a fortune. He funded a new range on Queen&#x27;s Lane built in 1671–72. Following a bequest of books from Thomas Barlow, a new library was built between 1693 and 1696 by master builder John Townesend. A further bequest from Williamson of £6,000, along with purchase of the buildings along the High Street, allowed a new front quad to be built and for the remaining medieval buildings to be replaced. This was completed by 1759 by John&#x27;s son William Townesend. The college gained a large number of benefactions during this time, which helped to pay for the buildings and bring in more scholars from other, mostly northern, towns.

From the 1750s, as with other Oxford colleges, standards dropped. The Oxford commission of 1850–1859 revised the statutes and removed the northern preference for fellows and most of the students. Over the coming years, requirements for fellows to be unmarried were relaxed, the number of fellows required to have taken orders and studied theology was reduced, and in 1871 the Universities Tests Act allowed non-conformists and Catholics.

Like many of Oxford&#x27;s colleges, Queen&#x27;s admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979, after more than six centuries as an institution for men only.

=== Naming ===
The college is named for its first patroness, Queen Philippa. Established in January 1341 &#x27;under the name of the Hall of the Queen&#x27;s scholars of Oxford&#x27; (&quot;sub nomine aule scholarium Regine de Oxon&quot;), the college was subsequently called the &#x27;Queen&#x27;s Hall&#x27;, &#x27;Queenhall&#x27; and &#x27;Queen&#x27;s College&#x27;. The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford Act 1584 (27 Eliz. 1. c. &quot;2&quot;) sought to end this confusion by providing that it should be called by the one name &quot;the Queen&#x27;s College&quot;; in practice, the definite article is usually omitted. The full name of the College, as indicated in its annual reports, is &quot;The Provost and Scholars of The Queen&#x27;s College in the University of Oxford&quot;. Queens&#x27; College in Cambridge positions its apostrophe differently and has no article, as it was named for multiple queens (Margaret of Anjou and Elizabeth Woodville).

=== In popular culture ===
In April 2012, as part of the celebrations of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, a series of commemorative stamps was released featuring A-Z pictures of famous British landmarks. The Queen&#x27;s College&#x27;s front quad was used on the Q stamp, alongside other landmarks such as the Angel of the North on A and the Old Bailey on O.
=== Traditions ===
One of the most famous feasts of the College is the Boar&#x27;s Head Gaudy, which originally was the Christmas dinner for members of the College who were unable to return home to the north of England over the Christmas break between terms, but is now a feast for old members of the College on the Saturday before Christmas.

== Buildings ==

=== Front Quad ===

The main entrance on the High Street leads to the front quad, which was built between 1709 and 1759. There are symmetrical ranges on the east and west sides, while at the back of the quad is a building containing the chapel and the hall. The architect Nicholas Hawksmoor, a leading figure of the English Baroque style, provided a number of designs that were not used directly but that heavily influenced the final design. In the cupola above the college entrance is a statue of the British queen Caroline of Ansbach by the sculptor Henry Cheere; the legend &#x27;Carolina Regina, 12 November 1733&#x27; may be found marking the laying of the foundation stone of the screen wall, which is visible from the High Street.

=== Back Quad ===
A second and older quad lies to the north of the hall and chapel. The west side consists of the library. The east side is the Williamson building, which was originally built to a design by the architect Christopher Wren, known for his work in the English Baroque style, but has been largely rebuilt since then.

=== Chapel ===
The chapel is noted for its Frobenius organ in the west gallery. It was installed in 1965, replacing a Rushworth and Dreaper organ from 1931. The earliest mention of an organ is 1826. The Chapel Choir has been described as &quot;Oxford&#x27;s finest mixed-voice choir&quot; and continues to perform termly concerts, recent examples of which include Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; and Bach&#x27;s &quot;St John Passion&quot;. The chapel has stood virtually unchanged since it was consecrated by the Archbishop of York in 1719.

Holy Communion is celebrated every Sunday morning and at other times, and is open to all communicant members of any Christian church or denomination. The Sunday evening service takes the traditional form of Choral Evensong, which is also held on Wednesday and Friday evenings during term. Morning and evening prayer is said daily, and at other times some like to use the stillness for their own prayer. Baptisms, confirmations, and weddings are also conducted for members or former members of the College.
=== Library ===

==== The Upper Library ====
The Upper Library has been a focal point for the College ever since its construction at the end of the 17th century. The ceiling plasterwork, its most outstanding feature, was designed by James Hands, whilst the library itself was built by John Townsend. The designer remains unknown, although a likely candidate is Henry Aldrich, who was Bishop of Oxford and Dean of Christ Church, as well as chief communicator between Christopher Wren and the College whilst the Back Quad was being designed. Unlike many other similar rooms in Oxford libraries, the Upper Library remains as a silent reading room for students open during staffed hours.

===== Eighteenth Century Globes and Orrery =====
On display in the middle of the library are two eighteenth century papier maché Senex globes and an orrery from the same period. John Senex was the foremost globe maker of the eighteenth century, and also crafted the miniature globe featured in the orrery. The globes are now found in cases that were designed and fitted by Welsh furniture designer Bernard Allen in 2007, after being removed from the library for a period of time in 2002 for structural repair and restoration by renowned English globe conservator Sylvia Sumira.

The Benjamin Cole orrery was a gift to the College in 1763 from a Group of Gentleman Commoners of the College, recorded in two entries in the Benefactors&#x27; Book, as well as on an inscription in the lunar calendar scale. The instrument is made of brass, steel, and wood, contained within a wooden case and resting on a mahogany stand with a glazed cover. Johnathan Betts, in an &quot;Excerpt from A report following the servicing and inspection of The Queen&#x27;s College Grand Orrery&quot; in 2016, describes the instrument as standingon a fine mahogany table with six finely carved cabriole legs, the whole covered with a multi-panelled protective glass shade which can be locked securely onto the table, preventing access to the orrery.In the same article, Betts illustrates the orrery,fitted in a mahogany twelve-sided case, with lacquered brass mounts and surmounted, on a brass pillared gallery, with a large lacquered brass hemispherical armillary structure. The mechanical orrery itself incorporates within its compass the solar system out to Mars, including the Earth and Moon, with additional mountings fixed on the outside of the case for attaching static models of Jupiter and Saturn.The turning of the orrery is a traditional event at Queen&#x27;s, done by hand only once every few years or on special occasions. Only two people are permitted to turn the orrery: the Patroness of the College, a position most recently occupied by The Queen Mother, and the Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy, a Fellow of Queen&#x27;s. This event most recently took place on 4 February 2020, during the Hilary term, with professor Jonathan Keating as the honorary orrery-turner.

==== The Lower and New Libraries ====
The open cloister below the Upper Library was enclosed in the 19th century to form the Lower Library, which now houses the bulk of the lending collection. The lending collection consists of around 50,000 with an additional 70,000 items in the special collections available by appointment. In April 2017 the New Library opened beneath the Provost&#x27;s Garden, with an official opening by Old Member Rowan Atkinson taking place in November of the same year.

=== Annexes ===
Queen&#x27;s is able to provide accommodation for all of its undergraduates, who are divided between the college&#x27;s main buildings and annexes nearby. Adjacent to college is Carrodus Quad, located just across Queen&#x27;s Lane. It has been completely refurbished, and now has approximately 80 en-suite rooms for first-year students, as well as a few second- and third-/final-year students with access requirements. The building also houses a conference room, one of the college&#x27;s music practice rooms (the other one being located in the Back Quad of the main college), and the college gym. The college also owns the Cardo Building opposite the Oxford University Sports centre on Iffley Road (where Roger Bannister ran the first ever four-minute mile in 1954). This building is home to a mixture of second and third years, and features a common room, breakfast room and the college&#x27;s two squash courts. Near the Cardo Building is the James Street Building, the smallest of the annexes with twelve rooms.

The Florey Building in St Clement&#x27;s, designed by James Stirling and named after former Queen&#x27;s Provost and Nobel Prize winner Howard Florey, is a former annex that housed most of the college&#x27;s first years until 2018, when it fell into disuse following complications that arose in attempts to refurbish the building. It contains nearly 80 rooms; those on the top floor have a mezzanine level where the students&#x27; beds were located. At one end of the building on the ground floor, there is a common room and a breakfast room. Following the closure of the Florey Building in 2018, the former post-graduate annex, St Aldate&#x27;s House, became the largest undergraduate annex at Queen&#x27;s, with three floors, 90 en suite rooms, and kitchens shared with up to nine other students. The annex is situated down St Aldate&#x27;s directly opposite the Christ Church Meadows, near Folly Bridge.

While many postgraduate students choose to live outside College accommodation, two postgraduates annexes are provided: Oxley-Wright House, which is owned by the College, and a portion of the Venneit Close complex, which is rented from North Oxford Property Services (NOPS). The former is a large Victorian house on Banbury Road, near Summertown, with 13 rooms and a large garden. None of the rooms are en suite, and there are 3 bathrooms in the building, each shared between approximately 4 people. The latter includes 18 apartments, each with three study bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen (with a washing machine) and a dining/sitting room. Both annexes are within a 10- to 20-minute walk from the city centre.

=== Gallery ===
== Student life ==

Queen&#x27;s is an active community performing strongly in intercollegiate sport competitions, having a variety of societies and, as one of the larger colleges, hosting triennial Commemoration balls. The 2007 ball coincided with the 666th anniversary of the college.

Queen&#x27;s is host to a number of dining, drinking and sports societies, as well as some which are more academically orientated such as a medical society.

=== The JCR, MCR, and Old Taberdar&#x27;s Room ===
The Junior Common Room (JCR) consists of the collective body of undergraduates at the college, and also refers to the room under the same name, located in the Back Quad, which is the only common room in the college that cannot be booked. The JCR is not to be confused with the JCR General Committee, which consists of all members of the Executive Committee, Equalities Committee, and Welfare Committee, all presidents of college societies and the president of the ball committee, as well as the Academic &amp; Careers Representative, Access and Outreach Representative, Food Representatives, Environment &amp; Ethics Representatives, Student Union Representatives, Stash Representative, Charities Representative, Webmasters, Arts Representative, Antisocial Secretary (a position passed on in a &#x27;hereditary&#x27; manner through one&#x27;s &#x27;College family&#x27;), Warden of the Beer Cellar, and the Keeper of the Boars, Bees, and Eagles.

The Middle Common Room (MCR) refers to the postgraduates of the college. Like the JCR, the MCR have an Executive team, which includes the President, Victualler, Vice-President Secretary, Treasurer, Social Secretary, SCR Liaison Officer, LGBTQ+ Officer, Welfare Officer, Environment and Charities Representative, IT Officer, Sports Secretary, Oxford SU Representative, First Year Representative, and Entz Representative (the last four positions being empty as of 2020). The MCR and JCR will often liaise with one another in order to organise events in the college.

The Old Taberdar&#x27;s Room is a room unique to Queen&#x27;s, described by the college asa traditional wood-panelled room, furnished with comfortable sofas and chairs. The room is ideal as a lounge space or for informal discussion based session.It is open for use by all members of the college, though it is possible to book it for events such as welcome drinks, pre-dinner drinks, student production rehearsals, and society meetings. A Taberdar is specifically &quot;a holder of a scholarship at Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford&quot;.

=== Sport ===

College sport at Queen&#x27;s is organised and funded through the Amalgamated Sports Clubs Committee, consisting of individual club captains and other representatives of college sport. The college competes in most of the intercollegiate Cuppers (tournament style) and league sports, with many 1st teams competing in top divisions.

The college playing field, less than a mile from the main buildings, runs down to the banks of the Isis. It has a football and a hockey pitch, together with hard tennis courts, a netball court and a pavilion. The football ground is nicknamed Fortress Riverside by the club and its supporters, owing to its close proximity to the Isis . The Queen&#x27;s College shares a rugby pitch nearby with University College. In the summer, the goalposts go down and a cricket square appears in the middle.

On the opposite bank of the river is a boathouse, which Queen&#x27;s shares with Oriel and Lincoln colleges. The Queen&#x27;s College Boat Club, founded in 1827, is one of the oldest boat clubs in the world. In 1837, QCBC represented Oxford in a Boat Race against Lady Margaret Boat Club, representing Cambridge, and won. This event, held on the River Thames at Henley-on-Thames, is credited with contributing to support from the town for the establishment of the Henley Royal Regatta, one of the most famous rowing events in the world, in 1839. The college&#x27;s colours were changed thereafter from red and white to navy blue and white, the colours of the university. Rowing is still a major sport in the College, with the men&#x27;s first boat winning blades in Torpids 2021 and the women&#x27;s first boat winning blades in both Torpids 2023 and Summer Eights 2023. The College was last Head of the river in Torpids and Eights in 1958.

The college&#x27;s two squash courts are located at the Cardo Building annex on Iffley Road.

=== Music ===

The Queen&#x27;s College is host to a mixed-voice Chapel Choir. The singers include Choral Scholars (up to eighteen at any one time) and volunteers, all of whom are auditioned. The Choir sings Evensong three times a week during term, and performs one major concert each term, often with a noted orchestral ensemble. The choir also undertakes regular tours and short visits both within this country and abroad. The Eglesfield Musical Society, named after the founder, is the oldest musical society in Oxford. It organises a substantial series of concerts each year, ranging from chamber music to orchestral works.

=== College Grace ===
As is the case with many Oxbridge colleges, Queen&#x27;s uses a Latin grace which is recited every evening before the second sitting of dinner:

&quot;Benedic nobis, Domine Deus, et his donis, quae ex liberalitate Tua sumpturi sumus; per Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.&quot;

A rough English translation: &quot;Bless us, Lord God, and these gifts which we are about to receive through your bounty; through Jesus Christ, our Lord, Amen&quot;

At gaudy dinners this grace is sung by the choir.
