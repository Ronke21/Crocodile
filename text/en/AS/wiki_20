<text>Tar Heel is a town located in Bladen County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 90 at the 2020 census.

Tar Heel is home to the largest pig processing plant in the world, which opened in 1992, operated by Smithfield Foods and is located just north of the town limits.

==Geography==
Tar Heel is located on the banks of the Cape Fear River. Its major highways are NC 87 and NC 131. Fayetteville is to the north, Elizabethtown is to the southeast, and Lumberton is to the southwest.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

== History ==
This farming community has a history dating back to the Revolutionary War. Colonel Thomas Robeson, for whom Robeson County was named, lived in the Tar Heel community. His home is located just to the east of the town. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as Walnut Grove.

The town of Mayville, no longer in existence, was on the Robeson and Bladen County line and was the village mentioned in the diary of Elizabeth Ellis Robeson (1847–1866). Just when the village moved to what is now Tar Heel is unknown. During the Civil War, Colonel Thomas Purdie and Captain Daniel Munn, residents of the Tar Heel area, led troops at Gettysburg and Fort Fisher.

The Town of Tar Heel was incorporated by the State of North Carolina in 1963.

The town was known for its landing on the Cape Fear River. The state operated a ferry at this landing, and it was a major loading point for vessels that transported agricultural goods to the market in Wilmington. The major product was barrels of turpentine. Tar Heel had several turpentine stills, and the remains of some of the old stills can be found in the area. The results of transporting the barrels of turpentine, leaking barrels, caused a tar-like material to be found around the landing and the access to the river. When the community people talked of going to the village, it was said they were going to get tar on their heels, thus the name Tar Heel.

The town of Tar Heel is often confused with Chapel Hill, North Carolina, home of the University of North Carolina Tar Heels.

The Purdie House and Purdie Methodist Church and Walnut Grove are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Government ==
The town of Tar Heel is governed by a mayor/council governing body. The mayor and council are elected to four-year terms. The town&#x27;s council meets monthly. In July 2011, the town of Tar Heel made world news when it was announced that no one was running for any of the four positions on the town board. The town held the election and Roy Dew was elected mayor of Tar Heel by write-in votes in November 2011. Also elected to the town&#x27;s council by write-in votes were Angela Hall, Sam Allen, and Derek Druzak (2013). The Town Mayor is now Sam Allen; he was selected to serve the remainder of Dew&#x27;s term, after the latter passed while in office. In 2021, Allen was elected to a full term as Mayor with Hall and Druzak re-elected to the town council by write-in, as well as Steve Dowless who was the only listed candidate for town council.

<text>Bald Head Island, historically Smith Island, is a village located on the east side of the Cape Fear River in Brunswick County, North Carolina, United States. Compared to the nearby city of Wilmington to the north, the village of Bald Head Island is small and somewhat remote. It is accessible by ferry from the nearby town of Southport and by four-wheel drive vehicle along the beach strand from Fort Fisher to the north. Only government officials are allowed to drive the beach strand route. There are few cars on the island; instead, residents drive modified electric golf carts. Bald Head Island is nationally recognized for its sea turtle nesting activity.

The population of the village was 268 at the 2020 census. The village is part of the Wilmington metropolitan area.

The village is revered for its picturesque nature and is a popular location for vacationing. It was the primary filming location for the film &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s&quot; in 1989 as well as a major location in &quot;The Butcher&#x27;s Wife&quot; in 1991. &quot;Old Baldy&quot;, its out-of-service lighthouse built in 1817, is the oldest still standing in the state.

==History==
Bald Head Island is tiny but has played a part in two American wars. During the American Revolution, it was home to Fort George, a British fort. During the Civil War, the same redoubts served as Fort Holmes, a Confederate base of importance to shipping and smuggling.

Located at the tip of Cape Fear and residing at the convergence of the Cape Fear River and Atlantic Gulf Stream, the land mass of Bald Head Island ends, trailing off into of treacherous sand bars known as Frying Pan Shoals. In this area, large sand bars seasonally emerge from and subsequently retreat into the sea. These topographical transformations are often as rapid as they are drastic. The consensus view is that Bald Head Island emerged from one such sandbar, stabilized by a succession of plant life, leading to a permanent land mass.

Author David Stick surmises that Native Americans used Bald Head Island in much the same way that it is used now, as a seasonal retreat. Bald Head Island&#x27;s creek estuaries and its abundance of shellfish were probably as attractive to Native American fishermen as they are to modern fishermen. Shellmounds found on Middle Island and Bluff Island indicate that Native Americans did visit the Smith Island complex, but disease and war killed off most of the Native American population, so it is difficult to know much about the original inhabitants.

Throughout the early European history of the Cape Fear region, Bald Head Island underwent several settlement attempts and went by many names. Unlike the specific landmarks which were renamed by each settler, the region was always known by the well-earned name, &quot;Cape Fear&quot;.

Though Spanish sailors probably frequented the island on their way to intercept the Gulf Stream off Cape Hatteras, Pedro de Quexos was the first documented explorer of the region in the 1520s, naming what is now the Santee River the &quot;River Jordan.&quot; Quexos&#x27; sponsor, Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón, visited the region himself in 1526. When Ayllón lost a ship to the treacherous shoals he abandoned his exploration efforts.

Over one hundred years after Quexos, William Hilton initiated an expedition called the &quot;Adventures about Cape Fayre&quot; by English Puritan dissidents in the 1660s. The effort was abandoned due to difficulties farming the sandy barren soil. Hilton returned in 1667 with the support of backers from Barbados, the &quot;Barbados Adventurers&quot;, aboard a ship, the &quot;Adventure&quot; (now the name of one of the Bald Head Island ferries). His efforts were again foiled by barren soil.

In 1664, John Vassal founded &quot;Charles Town&quot; with the aid of Barbadian backers on the west bank of what is now the Cape Fear River (which Vassal named the &quot;Charles River&quot;). His efforts failed due to his agitation of the native population. He was further dissuaded when his efforts to become governor of the region, Clarendon County, were subverted and the title was given to John Yeamans. After the settlers abandoned Charles Town, Yeamans nearly lost his life when his boat sank in a maze of sand bars in the mouth of the Charles River. Instead of trying to revive the colony, Yeamans established Charles Town farther south in what is now Charleston, South Carolina.

Charleston rapidly became a center of economic importance in the colonies. Charleston businessmen often engaged in trade with Native Americans in the vicinity of Cape Fear, reaping such prosperity that they had to pay special duties. Duties created political conflicts which ultimately led to the colony of the Carolinas being divided in 1710 along the Cape Fear River (named the &quot;Clarendon River&quot; by then). In 1713, to help establish the northern colony&#x27;s claim along the eastern bank, Thomas Smith, son of former Carolina governor Thomas Smith, Sr. was issued a land grant to what we now call Smith Island (called &quot;Cape Island&quot; at the time).

In 1776, Bald Head Island was briefly involved in the Revolutionary War after British Major General Henry Clinton and Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis used the island as a staging area for their voyage to Charleston, South Carolina. The British left behind a small garrison of troops with a few naval vessels to help keep the port closed to Continental shipping. The garrison of about 30 troops, under the command of Captain John Linzee, created Fort George (after King George) on the southwestern corner of Bald Head Island. Continental Brig. General Robert Howe was stationed across the river in Fort Johnson. After watching the British carefully, the Continentals launched a raid of 150 men on September 6, led by Col. Polk, against Fort George. Polk&#x27;s men captured five British sailors but were forced to flee when the remaining 25 took cover and the British vessels moored just off-shore opened fire and initiated pursuit. Polk used local knowledge, fleeing through a maze of shallow creeks, and escaped with only minor casualties (1 killed, 1 wounded). By October, the British troops withdrew and Bald Head saw no further action during the Revolution.

In 1863, Confederate troops constructed a fort named Fort Holmes as part of a defensive system for the Cape Fear River Basin, although no major battles were fought in this region during the U.S. Civil War.

In 1913, the island was purchased by T.F. Boyd and renamed &quot;Palmetto Island.&quot; Boyd subsequently built a beach boardwalk, pavilion and an eight-room hotel, before he lost the island in foreclosure due to failure to pay back taxes during the Great Depression.

In 1938, Frank Sherrill bought the island with the intention to develop it further. In 1970, Sherrill sold the island to the Cape Fear Corporation, which deeded three fourths of the island to the state of North Carolina for conservation. Since 1983, Bald Head Island Limited has been the named developer.

==Lighthouses==

===Original lighthouse===
The construction of a lighthouse at the mouth of the Cape Fear River was authorized by the Commissioners of the Cape Fear in 1789. The commission specified that the light be built &quot;at the extreme point on Bald-head or some other convenient place near the bar of said river, in order that vessels may be enabled thereby to avoid the great shoal called Frying-Pan.&quot; Funds had been raised for the implementation of navigation aids by taxing vessels entering the Port of Brunswick at six pence per ton. Additional funds were provided by the newly formed US Congress, who in August 1789 assumed responsibility for construction, maintenance and operation of all &quot;lighthouses, beacons, buoys and public piers&quot; in the United States. Land for the light was donated by Benjamin Smith in exchange for increased hunting regulation on the island.

Construction of the original light was completed in December 1794 at a final cost of $11,359.14. The light was placed under the care of lightkeeper Henry Long, who operated the light until 1806 when he was killed in a hunting accident on the island. After Long&#x27;s death Sedgewick Springs was appointed as keeper of the light at Bald Head after twelve local residents signed the following petition to U.S. President Thomas Jefferson recommending him for the position.

Less than twenty years after it was built, the original light succumbed to erosion as it had been built too close to the water. By July 1813 the light was officially declared inoperable.

===Old Baldy===

In 1813 Congress allocated $15,000 to build a new lighthouse on Bald Head, as the existing light had been rendered inoperable by erosion. This time they planned to build a sturdy lighthouse on high ground, away from eroding shores. Revenue Commissioner Samuel H. Smith wrote a detailed specification outlining how the light was to be built to ensure its longevity. Daniel Way was awarded the contract to build the light and keepers quarters. Using bricks from the original light, Way completed the project in 1817 at a cost of $15,915.45. In total Cash 

Immediately after lighting this lighthouse (now known as Old Baldy Light) it was discovered that the new light was not tall enough or bright enough to help vessels navigate around Frying Pan Shoals. Its purpose was limited to helping vessels enter the southern entrance to the Cape Fear River. To avoid Frying Pan Shoals, many vessels decided to enter the Cape Fear through New Inlet at Fort Fisher, about north of Bald Head Island. As a result, little emphasis was placed on maintaining Old Baldy, and by the mid-1830s the lighthouse began to fall into disrepair as its longtime keeper, Sedgewick Springs, an elderly veteran of the Revolutionary War became increasingly infirm.

Old Baldy was effectively decommissioned for the first time at the outset of the Civil War when the Confederate States turned off all their lighthouses in order to hinder navigation of Union vessels. At the end of the War Old Baldy was not re-lit. The light was in disrepair and of little use with most vessels entering New Inlet, which had its own lighthouse at Federal Point.

Circumstances changed by 1879 when natural forces closed New Inlet forcing the closure of the Federal Point light and the re-lighting of Old Baldy. Improvements were made to Old Baldy including a new light, keepers quarters, and a stone jetty to stabilize the shoreline which had begun eroding quickly due to the closure of New Inlet. According to reports, the jetty was built just in time to prevent Old Baldy from falling into the sea during the hurricane of September 1883.

Old Baldy was downgraded from a lighthouse to a navigational radio beacon in 1935. It was completely decommissioned in 1959 when the Oak Island Light was built. Old Baldy Lighthouse now stands as the oldest lighthouse in North Carolina, having survived neglect, war and weather. It is on the National Register of Historic Places and is open to the public.

===Cape Fear Light===
Old Baldy lighthouse, built in 1817, was not tall enough or bright enough to aid vessels trying to avoid Frying Pan Shoals in all weather conditions. To remedy the problem, a lightship was stationed on the shoals themselves in the mid-1800s. On multiple occasions the lightship broke loose and drifted freely, leaving Frying Pan Shoals without a light, or worse with a light in the wrong place. This problem was compounded when New Inlet closed and vessels were no longer able to avoid navigating around the shoals.

Requests to increase the height of Old Baldy and install a more powerful first order Fresnel lens to make it bright enough to safely guide ships around Frying Pan Shoals were never approved. Instead proposals for construction of a second lighthouse on Bald Head Island started in 1889 with the suggestion that a new , , masonry tower be built at a cost of $150,000. Approval did not come until 1898, at which time it was suggested that a steel tower be built for $70,000. Land for the construction site on the east end of Bald Head Island had to be condemned by the state from the island&#x27;s owner. Construction began in 1901 by laying a railway from the west end of the island to the east. This railway would transport materials and supplies over to the site both during construction and operation. The Cape Fear Light was operational on August 31, 1903. The light was operated by Devaney F. Jennette and then by Capt. Charlie Swan.

In 1958, the Cape Fear Light was demolished and replaced by the Oak Island Light. Lightships and a light tower were used to augment navigation around Frying Pan Shoals through the 1970s.

==Nature==

Bald Head Island is nationally recognized as a barrier island where people live in harmony with nature . The Bald Head Island Conservancy actively monitors water quality, the dunes, maritime forest and salt marsh. The BHI Conservancy in partnership with the USGS installed a real-time water quality monitor on one of the wells on the west side of the island. Data can be found on the USGS&#x27;s website.

A partnership between the BHI Conservancy, North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, the EPA and a group affiliated with the BHI Conservancy, Friends of BHI Deer is currently working on North Carolina&#x27;s first Non-Lethal Deer Management Project.

The BHI Conservancy and NC State University will install a research-grade weather station on Bald Head Island. This will help researchers, the Conservancy and BHI Village better understand a variety of weather elements and provide a foundation of information to help island officials make decisions.

The Island has four distinct habitats: beach and dunes; maritime forest; freshwater lagoons; and salt marsh/estuary. Live oak, cabbage palmetto, and longleaf pine are the most common trees found in the maritime forests and marsh hammocks. 10,000 of the total 12,400 acres that make up Bald Head Island are protected due to their use as nesting, wading, and migrating grounds for birds and other species. 

People from all over the world visit BHI for its birding in all season. To date over 260 species of birds have been documented on Bald Head Island, these include the white ibis, osprey, anhinga, snowy egret, great blue heron, tricolored heron, painted bunting, brown pelican, laughing gull, royal tern, and bald eagle. The Bald Head Island Conservancy offers a naturalist guided birding trip throughout the year.

Researchers from the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences visit Bald Head every summer to observe and tag painted buntings.

===Sea Turtles===
Bald Head Island is nationally recognized for its sea turtle nesting activity. The abundance of sea turtle nests have led visitors to use the phrase, &quot;I&#x27;m on Turtle Time&quot;, which signifies the care free (and car free) feeling of being on Bald Head Island.

Efforts to protect the habitats and activities of sea turtles on the Island date back to 1980. The Bald Head Island Conservancy has coordinated and sponsored a sea turtle protection program since 1983 and is the only non-government entity in North Carolina allowed to flipper tag nesting sea turtles. Each summer, the Conservancy funds and houses multiple interns to conduct field work for this program, under the direction of a sea turtle biologist. This internship is unique, demanding, and ultra-competitive.

Only four of the seven species of sea turtles nest on Bald Head Island. Loggerhead turtles are most common. Every season sees a few green turtles. In 2010, a leatherback turtle laid its first nest. Although rare, Bald Head has also had Kemp Ridley turtle nests, including one in 2020. These turtles are often found in different parts of the island and surrounding waters. The Kemp Ridley and Loggerhead sea turtle is often found estuarine and oceanic waters, whereas the hawksbill and leatherback sea turtles are often found in oceanic waters. 

Visitors to Bald Head Island can join the Conservancy&#x27;s Sea Turtle Protection Staff for a nightly Turtle Walk. After a 45-minute presentation about the renowned program and basic sea turtle biology, attendees are led to the beach to await sea turtle nestings or hatchings. The Conservancy is granted permission to conduct the Turtle Walks through a special state permit that restricts the group size to 25 Conservancy members a night.

=== Alligators ===
Alligators can be found in freshwater lagoons throughout Bald Head Island, though they can also be found laying out on the golf courses, salt marshes, or crossing the road. The Bald Head Association recently renovated the Wildlife Overlook - a lagoon where alligators are commonly seen - in September 2021 and added new improvements in November 2023.

Sightings are frequent during warmer months, though visitors are prohibited from feeding, harassing, and killing alligators. Alligators are typically harmless, but, if you encounter an alligator, it is recommended that you give it space, do not interact with it, and do not approach or follow it. The Bald Head Island Conservancy estimates that the total population on the island is about 30 - one third of which being longer than 4 feet. 

One of the most notable alligators of Bald Head Island was Stumpy II - &quot;a well-loved inhabitant of the Wildlife Overlook lagoon&quot;. He earned the name &quot;Stumpy II&quot; because he was missing his left rear leg, which was likely a result of an interaction with another alligator. He died in August 2024 at nine feet long and the estimated age of 15 to 20 years old. Stumpy II was recognized for his contributions to research on alligator health and population biology on BHI. He was captured in 2019 and 2022 for a North Carolina State University research project, which focused on assessing the health of alligators in response to PFAS and other contaminants. Alligators were critical to the study because they &quot;can be good indicators of environmental effects on immune function&quot; due to their robust immune systems and constant exposure to fresh water. 

=== Effects on the Environment and Wildlife ===
In the past decade, there has been an influx of tourism to Bald Head Island. Though good for the small island&#x27;s economy, the effects of pollution and building development on wildlife and nature of the island has been the focus of recent research. 

==== PFAS ====
PFAS, per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals, have been found in the blood of Cape Fear alligators, which were captured on Bald Head Island in 2019. PFAS are also found in water, air, fish, and soil and exposure to these chemicals has been linked to harmful health effects for both humans and wildlife.

The BHI Conservancy has partnered with Belcher Lab to track alligator movements and potential exposure to different water sources, which will help reveal sources of PFAS to Bald Head Island&#x27;s water. 

==== Light Pollution ====
Light pollution affects sea turtles and their natural processes. From May 1 to October 31, Bald Head Island enforces ordinance against artificial lighting near and on beaches to protect sea turtles during nesting season. Lights that shine on nesting ground can draw turtle hatchlings away from the direction of the ocean, moon, and beach towards land, where they have a low chance of survival. These lights can also scare away incoming female turtles looking to nest on the beach.

The Village of Bald Head Island recommends that citizens &quot;dig the dark&quot; and only use red lights on the beach.

==== Microplastics ====
Microplastics have been found in the sand of Bald Head Island. These microplastics &quot;have the potential to impact our endangered sea turtles&quot; because the plastics can trap heat, making the sand too hot during incubation. The temperature eggs are exposed to during this period is especially important because sea turtles have temperature-dependent sex determination, meaning this excess heat impacts the sex ratio of the population. These plastics also have the potential to leach toxins into the environment, though it is unknown how these toxins would impact developing turtle eggs.

==== Zoning ====
Future development and zoning of the maritime forest of Bald Head Island could pose serious threats to the habitats, food webs, and wildlife of the island. These forests are &quot;vital ecosystems that offer environmental resilience to coastal communities, acting as natural buffers against storms&quot;. Additionally, they help enhance wildlife biodiversity, provide aesthetic value, increase recreational opportunities, and filter pollutants. These plans could lead to a continued cycle of urbanization patterns and increase in impervious surfaces - both of which are major contributors to environmental change due to their effects on climate, water, and biodiversity.

<text>Bolivia is a town in Brunswick County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 149 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Brunswick County.

==History==
The town was settled by European Americans in the 1890s and was incorporated in 1911. One theory about the name is that many boxes being shipped from the area said &quot;Bolivia&quot;, referring to the country in South America, and the people liked that name.

A post office called Bolivia has been in operation since 1892. The town is named after Bolivia, in South America. Bolivia was incorporated as a town in 1911.

National Airlines Flight 2511 blew up over Bolivia on January 6, 1960. The DC-6B was destroyed by an explosion of dynamite.

When U.S. 17 was widened to four lanes, a bypass was constructed around Bolivia; intended to improve traffic, the highway drew away visitors and retail customers, causing an economic decline in the town. In 1977, the county decided to move the county seat of Brunswick County from Southport to Bolivia. Being a center of government operations stimulated other businesses and had helped Bolivia build its businesses.

==Geography==
Old U.S. Route 17 (Old Ocean Highway) passes through the center of the town, while the current U.S. Route 17 (Ocean Highway) bypasses it to the northwest. US-17 leads northeast to Wilmington and southwest to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

<text>Carolina Shores is a town in Brunswick County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 3,048 at the 2010 census, up from 1,482 in 2000. It is part of the Wilmington, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The town was incorporated in 1998 after a split from the town of Calabash, which came as the result of years of disagreement over &quot;sewer, garbage collection and sign restrictions&quot;. The town limits of Carolina Shores currently interlock with those of Calabash. Sharing the name of the local country club, &quot;Carolina Shores&quot; could be considered a misnomer since the town does not have a &quot;shore&quot; with any large body of water.

Carolina Shores is located in southwestern Brunswick County. Its southwestern border is the South Carolina state line; the town of Calabash borders Carolina Shores to the south. U.S. Route 17 (Ocean Highway) forms the northwestern border of the town; the highway leads northeast to Wilmington and southwest to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Carolina Shores has a total area of , of which , or 0.17%, is water.

<doc id="127701" wikidata="Q2027437" url="?curid=127701" title="Caswell Beach, North Carolina">
<text>Caswell Beach is a small seaside town located on the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the Cape Fear River in Southeastern North Carolina, United States. Occupying the eastern part of Oak Island in Brunswick County, its population was listed at 395 in the 2020 census. Prominent features include the Civil War era Fort Caswell, the Oak Island Lighthouse co-located with the Oak Island Coast Guard Station, and the Oak Island Golf Club, the sole business in town and one of the few eighteen-hole courses located on a North Carolina barrier island. Along with the Town of Oak Island which occupies the central and west parts of the island, Caswell Beach is part of the Wilmington, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Contiguous to Fort Caswell which dates from 1825, Caswell Beach was incorporated as a town in 1975; both were named for Richard Caswell, 1st &amp; 5th Governor of North Carolina. The fort which is located on the extreme eastern end of Oak Island now houses the North Carolina Baptist Assembly, a Christian retreat and conference center and in 2013 it was designated a National Historic District. Also on the east end of town, the Oak Island Lighthouse which became operational in 1958 was acquired by the town in 2004 after extensive negotiations with the National Park Service. In 1975, the same year the town was incorporated, all 18 holes of the Oak Island Golf Club on the west end of town were first opened for play. Caswell Beach slowly developed into a vacation resort community, but was plagued over the years by the incessant erosion of beach sand due to hurricanes and northeasters. This erosion threatened the town&#x27;s main thoroughfare (Caswell Beach Rd) and made uninhabitable many ocean front houses. Installation of roadside sandbags provided temporary relief and its success prompted the town to set in motion an intensive restoration and preservation effort focused on installing sand fences and planting sea oats/beach grass. This work was abetted by the Wilmington Harbor Channel Project, which dumped huge amounts of sand on the beach as a least cost disposal option. This effort was very successful and widely recognized as the town received a national award in 2002 for Best Restored Beach.

==Geography==
Roughly halfway distant from Wilmington, North Carolina and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Caswell Beach is located on the east end of Oak Island. This island is the easternmost of the South Brunswick Islands which were formed in the late 1930s by the construction of the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) which was dredged from Southport, NC at the mouth of the Cape Fear River through coastal sounds and marshes to the Little River in South Carolina. Elevations in the town range from sea level to approximately 25&#x27;while the town has a total area of , of which is land.

===Climate===
Summers in Caswell Beach are hot and humid with an average temperature of 85˚, although the beach front is cooled much of the time by sea breezes (the prevailing winds are from the southwest). Winters are moderate with an average temperature in the 50s (°F), albeit with brief cold periods. Rain occurs throughout the year with average annual rainfall approximately 57&quot;, 45% of this falling between June and September. 
Tropical storms are a continuing source of concern, e.g., in October 1954, Hurricane Hazel washed away almost all the houses on Oak Island. A threat in late summer/early fall, the 1996-1999 period was intense with four major hurricanes (Bertha, Fran, Bonnie, and Floyd) making landfall and having significant effects on the area, while in the fall of 2005, Hurricane Ophelia and Tropical Storm Tammy combined to cause flooding in low-lying areas. More recently, in October 2016, the eye of Hurricane Matthew passed almost directly over the town, inflicting extensive damage to the dune system, and in September 2018, Hurricane Florence caused severe flooding and wind damage in addition to washing away most of the beach sand added earlier in the year.

==Demographics==

The 395 people identified in the 2020 census reside in some 190 permanent households (overall there were 681 housing units in Caswell Beach at the time of the census). This population is essentially all white, fairly elderly (median age 63) with more women (55%) than men (45%). Median household income is $74,219. None of the population or families were below the poverty line. While the number of full-time residents is fairly small, in the summer peak population reaches 2,000, mostly family vacationers using rental properties.

==Housing==
Large single family homes, many of which serve as vacation rental properties, can be found along the beach strand at the east end of town, while on the west end, the ocean-front Oak Island Beach Villas feature condo rental units. Most of the full-time residents live clustered in and around the golf course in various types of housing: the Arboretum (single family homes) Caswell Dunes (patio homes and condo units), and Ocean Greens (single family, duplexes, townhouses, and luxury condos).

==Government==
The town government operates under a council-manager type system where various officials have authority to make decisions on services, revenues and expenditures in accordance with a state issued charter. The Governing Body consists of six members (the Mayor who votes only in case of a tie and five Commissioners) all of whom are elected for four year terms on a two-year rotational schedule. Town Hall is located in the west end of town next to the newly constructed Public Services Facility, which houses the Caswell Beach Police and Public Works Departments along with units of the Southport Fire Department and Brunswick County EMS.

==Attractions==
Beach. In way of combating erosion rates ranging from 2-5&#x27; per year, the town&#x27;s three mile long, south facing beach has been re-nourished three times in the past 17 years as part of the Wilmington Harbor Channel dredging project. The beach also serves as a sea turtle nesting area, which has spurred a vigorous dune protection and restoration program featuring sea oats/beach grass plantings. This program not only benefits turtle nesting but protects the town against hurricane storm surge damage. As for public access to the beach, the town maintains a free parking lot and 12 walkways spread out along the strand, most of which have wheelchair ramps.



Golf Course. The 18 hole, par 72 course at the Oak Island Golf Club is open to the public. The 6,720 yard course layout has 37 bunkers and water in play on 11 different holes with five sets of tees (back tees are course rated at 73.1 with a slope of 139). The course features ultradwarf TifEagle greens and Bermuda tees/fairways/rough while Long Leaf Pines, Live Oaks and Yaupon Holly trees border most every fairway. George Cobb, co-designer of Augusta National&#x27;s par 3 course, is the architect. A full practice facility is available to the public which includes a putting green, sand traps and a driving range.

Lighthouse. The Oak Island Lighthouse grounds are open to the public year-round for viewing and picture taking, with limited 30 minute parking provided at the base of the tower from sunrise until sunset. During the summer months, two types of interior tours are available (the one to the top is by appointment only). The light is maintained by personnel housed at the adjacent Coast Guard Station, while the structure itself is cared for and managed by a citizens group, Friends of Oak Island Lighthouse (FOIL). A major exterior rehabilitation project was completed in 2016, notable in that it was funded entirely by contributions. Located across the street slightly to the east of the lighthouse is the historic Oak Island Life Saving Station.

Fort Caswell Fort Caswell is accessible by the public to a limited extent per the conditions set forth by the Director, North Carolina Baptist Assembly. Now utilized as a Christian retreat and conference center, during the Civil War it defended Confederate positions on the North Carolina coast. Subsequently, it served as an army training ground in World War I and as a patrol communications base in World War II. Thus its forts and batteries provide opportunities to view and connect with a significant part of US history. Also a part of the Fort Caswell Historic District but located further west in the Caswell Dunes area is the Fort Caswell Rifle Range used by WW I soldiers for target practice. &quot;Brunswick County in the Great War&quot; published in 2020 contains a 25-page section with numerous rifle pit photos and diagrams along with biographic sketches of all known Brunswick County NC WW I service members.

Natural Habitat. Given its small population and remote location, much of the town&#x27;s charm rests with its salt and fresh water marshes and a maritime forest, all of which support a wide range of plant and animal life. Alligators, turtles, foxes, deer, raccoons, beavers, eagles, brown pelicans, great white and blue herons, and ibis abound, while an occasional bear has been known to swim across the Intracoastal Waterway to visit the town. As for plant diversity, live oak, Longleaf Pine and Yaupon Holly predominate in the forest, while Azaleas, American Beautyberry and Sweet Bay Magnolia thrive both in natural and landscaped areas.

==Neighboring Communities==
Oak Island. The Town of Oak Island, which occupies the rest of the island, has a contract post office, a branch of the county library, supermarkets, liquor store, two fishing piers a few gas stations, numerous small professional offices/retail stores, and a large number of restaurants.

Southport. Located just across the ICW is the city of Southport (pop. 3,700). Founded as Smithville in 1792, it is home to the NC Fourth of July Festival and has been the location for many movies, one of the more notable being Safe Haven (2013). The part of town known as &quot;Old Southport&quot; has many historic houses and buildings, e.g. Fort Johnston, and situated on its waterfront is the North Carolina Maritime Museum at Southport and year-round ferry service that provides scenic trips across the Cape Fear River to the NC Aquarium and Civil War battleground site at Fort Fisher.

<doc id="127702" wikidata="Q2023774" url="?curid=127702" title="Holden Beach, North Carolina">
<text>Holden Beach is a seaside town in Brunswick County, North Carolina. The population was 575 at the time of the 2010 census. It is part of the Wilmington, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Holden Beach is located in southern Brunswick County. The town occupies an barrier island on the Atlantic Ocean, bounded by Shallotte Inlet to the west, Lockwoods Folly Inlet to the east, and the Intracoastal Waterway to the north. One road, North Carolina Highway 130, crosses the Intracoastal Waterway to connect Holden Beach with the mainland. Via NC 130, it is northwest to the town of Shallotte.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Holden Beach has a total area of , of which is land and (20.72%) is water.

==History==

Before the American Revolution, early settlers seeking land near Lockwood&#x27;s Folly River applied for patents and received warrants for surveys of selected tracts. Upon payment of fifty shillings for each , the warrantee could receive a permanent grant for Royal Governor Arthur Dobbs.

Benjamin Holden in 1756 bought four mainland tracts and the island between his plantation and the ocean. This island extended from Lockwood&#x27;s Folly Inlet west to Bacon Inlet. Benjamin and his sons used the island for fishing and cattle grazing. During the Civil War Holden Beach and Lockwood&#x27;s Folley Inlet became the resting place of several shipwrecks: the Confederate blockade runners CSS &quot;Elizabeth&quot; and CSS &quot;Bendigo&quot; and the Union blockade ship USS &quot;Iron Age&quot;. The remains of the &quot;Bendigo&quot; can be seen on the eastern end of the island during the periods of low tide. Its wreck is marked with an orange navigation warning buoy and is located between Holden Beach and Oak Island. While the vessel&#x27;s wreck is roughly long, only the base of the engine&#x27;s exhaust funnel and a small portion of superstructure are visible above water. The ship is easily reached during low tide by swimming, but the wreck is extensively covered in abandoned fishing hooks and gear that may present potential hazards.

John Holden, Benjamin&#x27;s grandson, started a commercial fishery on the island and in 1924 surveyed a section which he called Holden Beach Resort, the plat of which represented the first subdivision of beach property in Brunswick County. In 1925, he built the Holden Beach bridge; it was subsequently destroyed by the Inland Waterway construction. He negotiated with the state of North Carolina for the institution of a public ferry to reach the island, but he did not live to see the ferry begin operation in 1934.

Luther S. Holden, John&#x27;s son, operated the old hotel that his father had built, started development of the property nearby and became a permanent resident in 1946. Soon afterwards, Luther S. Holden&#x27;s son, John F. Holden, began building other homes and renting them to vacationers. A bit later, other smaller developments were started west of the ferry location. In the early 1940s one could buy an oceanfront house with the land for about $600. John F. Holden and his wife Johnsie actually began the development of Holden Beach that would slowly become a resort area. The Holdens had two sons, Lyn and J. Alan Holden, the seventh generation of Holdens to live on Holden Beach.

In 1954, the island had about 300 homes and a turnbridge. After that year&#x27;s destructive Hurricane Hazel, which hit on October 15, 1954, the rebuilding was slow. On February 14, 1969, the island was incorporated, and on May 13, 1986, the Town of Holden Beach dedicated a new high-rise steel and concrete bridge, allowing better access to the then more than 1,900 homes on the island.

The one church on the island, the interdenominational Holden Beach Chapel, began as a Bible study in the home of Luther S. Holden and several other resident families on the island. Eventually land was donated and the church was erected in the 1940s. It was destroyed by Hurricane Hazel in 1954 but was rebuilt shortly thereafter. Today the chapel serves the many hundreds who live on and around Holden Beach and the numbers of visitors who vacation on the island during the summer months.

==Government==
The mayor of Holden Beach is J. Alan Holden and the mayor pro-tem is Gerald Brown. The town commissioners are Woody Tyner, Brain Murdock, Mike Sullivan, Rick Smith, and Pat Kwiatkowski.

==Demographics==

<doc id="127703" wikidata="Q2028761" url="?curid=127703" title="Leland, North Carolina">
<text>Leland is the most populous town in Brunswick County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 23,504 at the 2020 census, up from 13,527 in 2010. As of 2020, it is considered to be one of the fastest growing towns in North Carolina. It is part of the Wilmington, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area. and the Cape Fear Council of Governments. The town of Leland is in the northeastern part of Brunswick County, with the town of Navassa to the north, Belville to east, and Boiling Spring Lakes to the south. It is part of the Town Creek township, and Cape Fear region of North Carolina, a short distance north of the South Carolina state line. Leland is located west of Wilmington, north of Myrtle Beach, southeast of Fayetteville, and southeast of Raleigh.

==History==
===Settlement===
What is today known as Leland was once a small settlement built upon where Village Road crossed the Augusta, Columbia and Wilmington railroad lines. The town is named after (Joseph W. Gay) the first postmaster&#x27;s nephew, Leland Adams. Leland benefited greatly from its proximity to the Brunswick River, allowing it to serve as an early transportation center, giving travelers the ability to traverse the Brunswick and Cape Fear rivers.
===Incorporation===
The citizens of Leland voted down an attempt at incorporation in 1979. Leland was ultimately incorporated as a town on September 5, 1989, in a passing vote of 472–42. After the ordinance passed to incorporate the town of Leland, Leland was governed by twelve members of the Leland Town Charter Commission until Election Day of 1989. Leland has been governed by a mayor-council government since its first general election.

===Dispute with Belville===
In March and April 1989, Belville made unsuccessful attempts to annex the area known as Leland. This, in turn resulted in the Leland civic association making proactive attempts to incorporate to avoid annexation. Belville&#x27;s commissioners voted to annex a business district roughly an hour before Leland had finalized the vote to incorporate. Leland&#x27;s first mayor, Russell Baldwin, when questioned about the matter, stated: &quot;It was kind of a dirty trick. They made a mockery of the annexation laws.&quot;

===Merger attempts===
In 2012, according to Jack Batson, the mayor of Belville at the time, &quot;It&#x27;s something that&#x27;s always on people&#x27;s minds because you see the way the maps are laid out. It makes sense.&quot; Belville is effectively an enclave township surrounded by Leland&#x27;s borders to the left and the Brunswick River to the right. In April 1996, during Leland mayor Franky Thomas&#x27; tenure, an unsuccessful attempt was made to merge the Leland sanitary district, Leland, Belville, and Navassa into one large town. In 2000, Leland made an unsuccessful attempt to merge with Navassa, Belville, and the North Brunswick sanitary district. Another attempt was made in 2012 to merge with Belville. Leland officials attempted to entice Belville officials, citing the town&#x27;s contract issues with Urban Smart Growth that Belville had entered into years before to develop its downtown. If Leland and Belville were to merge, Belville would have the funds to buy out the contract, or fight it out in court. Jack Batson, the mayor of Belville at the time, faced heavy criticism for discussing the subject matter with Leland officials. One Belville resident stated; &quot;When I voted for Mr. Batson, I thought I was voting for the position of mayor, not God.&quot;

Cypress Cove park, previously known as Sturgeon Creek Park, was donated by Mr. Kirby Sullivan to the town of Leland in 2005. Cypress Cove Park is made up of 27 acres of wetlands and 1.2 acres of uplands. Cypress Cove Park is the first water access site for Leland, and features a fixed overlook deck, outdoor classroom, a floating dock, and handicap accessible fishing area.

<doc id="127704" wikidata="Q2022994" url="?curid=127704" title="Navassa, North Carolina">
<text>Navassa is a town in Brunswick County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 1,505 at the 2010 census, up from 479 in 2000.

Navassa is part of the Wilmington, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
A post office called Navassa was established in 1903. The community was named after Navassa Island. Navassa was incorporated as a town in 1977.

==Geography==
Navassa is located along the Brunswick and Cape Fear rivers.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (3.50%) is water.

===Biodiversity===
The Navassa and Cape Fear region in southeastern North Carolina is considered an exceptionally rich biodiverse area in the United States. This region hosts 50 different habitat types supporting 300 species of plants and animals. Twenty-two of these species are considered &quot;endemic&quot;, meaning they are found nowhere else in the world. An assessment of biodiversity was completed by the State and prioritized terrestrial habitats based on the presence and quality of significant natural areas, rare species, important bird areas, high quality wildlife habitat, and wetlands. Aquatic habitats were assessed based on aquatic significant natural heritage areas, native trout waters, anadromous fish spawning areas, high quality benthic communities, high quality waters, outstanding resource waters, oyster sanctuaries, shellfish harvest areas, fish nursery areas, submerged aquatic vegetation, and stream buffers. Anadromous means that fish are born in fresh water nurseries of Navassa&#x27;s creeks and rivers, spend most of their life in the sea (Atlantic Ocean) and return to the town&#x27;s fresh waters to spawn.

The Cape Fear River and Brunswick River marshes along Navassa&#x27;s eastern limits are an extensive of tidal marshes upstream of saltwater influence. This tidal freshwater marsh is characterized by tall herbs, grasses and wildflowers. This site supports the only known population of Carolina Bishop Weed in North Carolina. The natural area has been altered by human influences of ditching, diking and roadbed construction. Sturgeon Creek, along Navassa&#x27;s southern limits, is a tributary of the Brunswick River and supports the same uncommon natural community type of Tidal Freshwater Marsh. The marsh contains a population of Cypress Knee Sedge, a rare plant species.

Gullah describes a group of African Americans along the southeast coast of the United States from Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Jacksonville, Florida. They have a distinct culture, language, and lifestyle that have been preserved since the early 1700s. In the southeastern North Carolina area, the Gullah people of today are direct descendants of slaves who worked in the rice and peanut plantations of the Cape Fear River valley. Residents of Navassa have a direct link to this culture. At one time there were five different rice plantations in what is today Navassa. As the plantation system came to a close, the slaves who worked these plantations eventually resettled the area.

In 2006, the US Congress established the east coast Gullah-Geeche Cultural Heritage Corridor to help preserve and educated the public on the importance of this culture in our history. The corridor is preserved with the assistance of an executive committee, of which the Mayor of Navassa is vice-chairman.

<text>Oak Island is a seaside town located in the southeastern corner of North Carolina, United States. Part of Brunswick County, the major portion of the town is on Oak Island which it shares with Caswell Beach. Founded in 1999 as the result of the consolidation of two existing towns, Oak Island&#x27;s main industry is tourism. Per the 2020 census, the town has a permanent population of 8,396 while its summer population is near 50,000. It along with the town of Caswell Beach is part of the Wilmington, NC, Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
Oak Island, on which much of the town sits, has been inhabited since the early 19th century when Fort Caswell was constructed on its east end in 1838. The island developed slowly, but by the late 1930s it began attracting people from nearby Southport with fox hunting popular in the areas along the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW). In 1954, Hurricane Hazel struck, leaving only five buildings standing on the west end of the island The island recovered quickly however, and the towns of Long Beach and Yaupon Beach were incorporated. Along with this increasing level of development came strident demands for a reliable crossing of the ICW to provide access to the island. When the ICW was completed in the late 1930s, a swingbridge initially provided this service. Destroyed by a barge strike in 1971, construction of the high rise Barbee Bridge began almost immediately; it opened for traffic in 1975 (interim service included a ferry and pontoon bridge). A second high rise structure, the Swain&#x27;s Cut Bridge, was built over the ICW to the island in 2010. In 1999, Long Beach and Yaupon Beach, decided to consolidate into the Town of Oak Island, and while Caswell Beach considered the matter, it opted to stay independent. Immediately after the new town got up and running, it began to either incorporate or obtain Extra Territorial Jurisdiction (ETJ) on properties located to its north on the mainland.

==Geography==
Oak Island is located in southeastern Brunswick County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (7.02%) is water. It is bordered to the south by the Atlantic Ocean, to the east by Caswell Beach, to the north across the ICW in part by the town of St. James, and to the west by the town of Holden Beach across the Lockwood Folly Inlet. Additions to the town in the 20 years since it was formed in 1999, located on the mainland, consist of the following:

•Property on both sides of Long Beach Rd. (NC 133) to include the Cape Fear Regional Jetport, and South Harbour Village with its nine-hole golf course and marina.

• Land mostly west of Middleton Blvd. (NC 906) either planned for or under development, the largest of which was the ill-fated Seawatch complex (1738 of the planned 4171 lots are in Oak Island).

• Parcels north of Southport-Supply Rd. (NC 211), the most prominent being Midway Commons Shopping Center.

===Climate===
Summers in the town are hot and humid with an average temperature of 85˚, although the beach front is cooled much of the time by sea breezes (the prevailing winds are from the southwest). Ocean water temperatures range from the 50s in winter to the mid 80s in summer. Winters are moderate with an average temperature in the 50s (°F), albeit with brief cold periods. Rain occurs throughout the year with average annual rainfall approximately 57&quot;, 45% of this falling between June and September.

Tropical storms are a continuing source of concern with Hurricane Hazel being the most devastating. In the 1996-1999 period, four major hurricanes (Bertha, Fran, Bonnie, and Floyd) made landfall with Hurricane Floyd having significant effect on the town. More recently, in October 2016, the eye of Hurricane Matthew passed almost directly over the town inflicting extensive damage to the dune system, and in September 2018, Hurricane Florence caused severe flooding and wind damage in addition to washing away large amounts of beach sand.

In the early morning hours of August 4, 2020, Hurricane Isaias hit Oak Island as a Category 1 hurricane; the storm surge was around 9 feet, increased by a corresponding high tide. The fishing pier and its hotel, many businesses, and hundreds of homes were damaged, and in many places sand from shoreside dunes was pushed inland for 3 blocks. An estimated 75-100 vehicles were damaged; floating cars were a common sight at the height of the storm. Power was finally cut off as a safety precaution. In the succeeding weeks, a mandatory evacuation order and damage to rental properties prevented tourism, which is a major source of income for many residents.

==Government==
The town government operates under a Council-Manager type system where various officials have authority to make decisions on services, revenues and expenditures in accordance with a state issued charter. The council is Oak Island&#x27;s governing body and consists of five Commissioners and the Mayor. It sets the Town&#x27;s policy, enacts ordinances and adopts the annual budget. The actual operation of the town&#x27;s government is accomplished by the Town Manager who is hired by the council. Town Hall is collocated in the center of the island with the Oak Island Police Department, while units of the Oak Island Fire Department and Brunswick County EMS are deployed in various areas of the Town to respond to emergencies

==Attractions==
Primarily a family beach type locale, the island also provides many other types of recreational activity. The Oak Island Golf Club course and its related practice facilities are open to the public and an outdoor swimming pool is available for its members&#x27; use during the summer. Two public fishing piers jut out into the Atlantic Ocean while motor/sail boats moored to piers dot the ICW as well as the Davis Canal and Montgomery Slough. South Harbour Village has a nine-hole public golf course and a marina on the ICW with 1,000 linear feet of alongside dockage. All these waterways also attract a large number of kayakers. 

The Oak Island Recreation Center located mid-island provides both indoor and outdoor exercise facilities and rents out sports equipment and amenities like balloon tire, beach wheelchairs. Popular sporting events include the &quot;Run Oak Island&quot; Marathon held in February which also features a half-marathon along with a 5K and one mile run. And then in April, the Southport/Oak Island Chamber of Commerce sponsors the &quot;Oak Island Lighthouse Run&quot; which includes a half marathon, 10K, 5K and a one-mile fun run.

As for other activities, the town puts on an ocean front fireworks display as part of its Fourth of July festivities, and a parade down Oak Island Drive just before Christmas, while the Oak Island Library hosts a wide variety of events to include &quot;Socrates Cafe&quot; and &quot;Meet the Author&quot; programs.

<text>Ocean Isle Beach (or simply Ocean Isle, or OIB) is a small seaside town in Brunswick County, North Carolina, United States. It was incorporated as a town in 1959 and is part of the Wilmington, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 867 at the 2020 census. Located at the southern end of North Carolina&#x27;s Atlantic coastline, along the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, Ocean Isle Beach has private homes, seasonal rentals, and tourist attractions.

Ocean Isle Beach completed a roundabout located at North Carolina Highway 179. This design includes a brick retaining wall with &quot;Welcome to Ocean Isle Beach&quot; along with three bronze statues of children playing with kites.

The American Shore and Beach Preservation Association named Ocean Isle Beach the winner of its 2008 Best Restored Beach Award. Ocean Isle Beach&#x27;s quest for a federal beach restoration program began after Hurricane Hugo devastated the area in 1989. The town lobbied members of Congress for federal funding and opened a capital reserve savings account to provide the local share of funding necessary for restoration. Coastal engineers began the project in 2001 and provided high-quality sand for the beach and created a deeper channel for boaters. Judging for the award was based on three criteria: the economic and ecological benefits the beach brings to its community; the short and long-term success of the restoration project; and the challenges each community overcame during the course of the project.

==Geography==

<doc id="127710" wikidata="Q3438706" url="?curid=127710" title="Roger Bigod of Norfolk">
<text>Roger Bigod (died 1107) was a Norman knight who travelled to England in the Norman Conquest. He held great power in East Anglia, and five of his descendants were earls of Norfolk. He was also known as Roger Bigot, appearing as such as a witness to the Charter of Liberties of Henry I of England.

==Biography==
Roger came from a fairly obscure family of poor knights in Normandy. Robert le Bigot, certainly a relation of Roger&#x27;s, possibly his father, acquired an important position in the household of William, Duke of Normandy (later William I of England), due, the story goes, to his disclosure to the duke of a plot by the duke&#x27;s cousin William Werlenc.

Both Roger and Robert were rewarded with a substantial estate in East Anglia following the Norman Conquest of England. The Domesday Book of 1086 lists Roger as holding six lordships in Essex, 117 in Suffolk and 187 in Norfolk.

Roger Bigod&#x27;s base was in Thetford, Norfolk, then the see of the bishop, where he founded a priory which was later given to the abbey at Cluny. In 1101 he further consolidated his power when Henry I granted him licence to build a castle at Framlingham, which became the family seat of power until their downfall in 1307. Another of his castles was Bungay Castle, also in Suffolk.

In 1069 he, Robert Malet and Ralph de Gael (then Earl of Norfolk), defeated the Dane Sweyn Estrithson&#x27;s invasion attempt near Ipswich. After Ralph de Gael&#x27;s fall in 1074, Roger was appointed sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, and acquired many of the dispossessed earl&#x27;s estates. For this reason he is sometimes counted as Earl of Norfolk, but he probably was never actually created earl. (His son Hugh acquired the title earl of Norfolk in 1141.) He acquired further estates through his influence in local law courts as sheriff and great lord of the region.

In the Rebellion of 1088 he joined other barons in England against William II, whom they hoped to depose in favour of Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy. He seems to have lost his lands after the rebellion had failed, but regained them after reconciling with the king.

In 1100, Robert Bigod (Bigot) was one of the witnesses recorded on the Charter of Liberties, King Henry I&#x27;s coronation promises later to influence the Magna Carta of 1215.

In 1101 there was another attempt to bring in Robert of Normandy by removing King Henry, but this time Roger Bigod stayed loyal to the king.

He died on 9 September 1107 and is buried in Norwich. Upon his death there was a dispute over his burial place between the Bishop of Norwich, Herbert Losinga and the monks at Thetford Priory, founded by Bigod. The monks claimed Roger&#x27;s body, along with those of his family and successors, had been left to them by Roger for burial in the priory in Roger&#x27;s foundation charter (as was common practice at the time). The bishop of Norwich stole the body in the middle of the night and had him buried in the new cathedral he had built in Norwich.

For some time he was thought to have two wives, Adelaide/Adeliza and Alice/Adeliza de Tosny. It is now believed these were the same woman, Adeliza (Alice) de Tosny (Toeni, Toeny). She was the sister and coheiress of William de Tosny, Lord of Belvoir. Their father was Robert de Todeni.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, William Bigod, and, after William drowned in the disastrous sinking of the &quot;White Ship&quot; in 1120, by his second son, Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk. He also had three daughters: Gunnor, who married Robert fitz Swein of Essex, Lord of Rayleigh; Cecily, who married William d&#x27;Aubigny &quot;Brito&quot;; and Maud, who married William d&#x27;Aubigny &quot;Pincerna&quot;, and was mother to William d&#x27;Aubigny, 1st Earl of Arundel.

<text>Southport is a city in Brunswick County, North Carolina, United States, near the mouth of the Cape Fear River. Its population was 3,971 as of the 2020 census. The current mayor, Rich Alt, was elected to a two-year term in November 2023.

Southport is the location of the North Carolina Fourth of July Festival, which attracts 40,000 to 50,000 visitors annually.

==History==
The Southport area was explored in the 1500s by Spanish explorers. During the 18th century, British settlements along the Carolina coast lacked fortifications to protect against pirates and privateers, and numerous Spanish attackers exploited this weakness. In response to these attacks, Governor Gabriel Johnston in 1744 appointed a committee to select the best location to construct a fort for the defense of the Cape Fear River region. It was determined that the fort should be constructed at a site at the mouth of the Cape Fear River. During the same year, France declared war against Britain, later known as King George&#x27;s War, increasing the fort&#x27;s need. Further, increasingly bold Spanish privateer raids led the North Carolina General Assembly to authorize the construction of &quot;Johnston&#x27;s Fort&quot; in April 1745, which would come to be known as Fort Johnston. The governor of South Carolina agreed to lend ten small cannons for the fort, and the legislature, in spring 1748, appropriated 2,000 pounds for construction costs, and construction finally began. Southport developed around Fort Johnston.

Southport was founded as the town of Smithville in 1792. Joshua Potts had requested the formation of a town adjacent to Fort Johnston, and the North Carolina General Assembly formed a commission of five men to administer its founding. The town was named after Benjamin Smith, a colonel in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War and later governor of North Carolina. Smithville grew as a fishing village and through supporting military activity. Smithville was the county seat of Brunswick County from 1808 to 1977. In an effort to promote the town as a major shipping port, Smithville was renamed Southport in 1887. Smithville Township, in which Southport lies, and other local landmarks, such as the cemetery, retain the Smithville name. 
Interest in making Southport a major commercial port then prompted efforts to connect it via rail to Wilmington and the Atlantic Coast Line/Seaboard Air Line Railroad systems. After some 25 years of failed effort by various entrepreneurs, the Wilmington, Brunswick and Southern Railroad began operation in 1911. Running northwest out of Southport to Bolivia, the line then turned northeast towards Navassa where it joined the existing rail network. Poorly constructed, beset with continued revenue shortfalls and facing intense and growing competition from trucks/automobiles, the 30 mile long railroad ceased operation in 1945.

Ten years later, it would be the U.S. Government who would construct the present rail line from the Military Ocean Terminal Sunny Point just north of Southport to the interior rail system along a different, more direct path. Thus, while the renaming to Southport did not achieve its goal of making the town a major shipping port, Southport instead became known for its relaxed atmosphere and Victorian era seaside charm.

Impressed by the sunsets the southeast-facing island offered, he renamed &#x27;Bald Beach,&#x27; as it had been called previously, to &#x27;Sunset Beach.&#x27; Development began in earnest with the completion of a bridge connecting the beach island to the mainland in 1958, modeled by Gore and operated by him until 1961 when it was taken over by the North Carolina Department of Transportation. With the help of his son, Edward, Gore began selling property on the island in 1958. Additionally, Gore built the original pier on the island, named the &#x27;Vesta Pier&#x27; for the beached civil war blockade-runner which sat beneath the structure, though is now completely covered by sand. Sunset Beach was later incorporated as a town in 1963.

On February 15, 2021, an EF3 tornado hit the north side of town around midnight, damaging multiple homes in several neighborhoods, including some that were completely destroyed. Three people were killed and 10 others were injured.

==Geography==
Sunset Beach is located in southwestern Brunswick County. It is the last developed Atlantic Ocean beach before the South Carolina border. One-third of the town&#x27;s area occupies a barrier island between the ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway; the remainder of the town extends onto the mainland to the north. Undeveloped Bird Island is directly to the west, Calabash is the closest town to the west on the mainland. Ocean Isle Beach is to the east, just past the easternmost point of Sunset Beach, Krause Point. 

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Sunset Beach has a total area of , of which is land, and (12.22%) is water.

== Sunset Beach Bridge ==
Since most of Sunset Beach and the adjoining Bird Island coastal reserve encompass a barrier island, the only way to get there from the mainland was by crossing a pontoon bridge (swing bridge) straddling the Intracoastal Waterway and adjacent marshland. It was a wooden structure that could only hold one lane of traffic at any given time, and was the only one of its kind still in use along the East Coast until 2010. During the day in the summer, traffic would be stopped every hour, on the hour, and the bridge would open to boat traffic on the waterway for 10 minutes. At 10 minutes after the hour, every hour, the bridge would reopen for vehicular traffic again for 50 minutes. During the off-season, the bridge only opened at the request of boat traffic. While this caused headaches for those trying to get on or off the island, many locals said the bridge did, however, give the town a more relaxed feel. Historically, this had been in stark contrast to the rapid growth affecting other beach communities along the Grand Strand.

In February 2008 the NCDOT started construction to replace the old bridge with a modern, arc bridge (non-draw, non-swing). The bridge opened November 11, 2010. The old Sunset Beach pontoon swing bridge was saved by the Old Bridge Preservation Society which plans to create a museum celebrating the old bridge and the town&#x27;s history. The new bridge eliminates the need for a bridge keeper and provides for a continual flow of vehicle traffic on and off the island, and water traffic on the Intracoastal Waterway.


==Housing in Sunset Beach==
The town consists of both mainland neighborhoods and a barrier island of approximately 1,200 homes. Three of the larger mainland neighborhoods in the town are golf course developments at Oyster Bay, Sea Trail Resort and Sandpiper Bay. Ocean Ridge Plantation, while not in the town limits, has one of its &quot;sister communities&quot; in Sunset Beach&#x27;s ETJ. Ocean Ridge has an amenities center/clubhouse on the island, while Sea Trail Home Owners Association has a designated parking lot for members. The island is primarily home to vacation rental homes and cottages, although there are close to 100 full-time residents as well.

 The Old Bridge has been moved and is now a museum and gift shop, sitting almost directly under the new Mannon C. Gore bridge.

<text>Asheville ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Buncombe County, North Carolina, United States. Located at the confluence of the French Broad and Swannanoa rivers, it is the most populous city in Western North Carolina, and the state&#x27;s 11th-most-populous city. According to the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 94,589, up from 83,393 in the 2010 census. It is the principal city in the four-county Asheville metropolitan area, which had an estimated population of 417,202 in 2023.

==History==
===Origins===
Before the arrival of the European Colonists, the land where Asheville now exists lay within the boundaries of the Cherokee Nation, which had homelands in modern western North and South Carolina, southeastern Tennessee, and northeastern Georgia. A town at the site of the river confluence was recorded as &quot;Guaxule&quot; by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto during his 1540 expedition through this area. His expedition comprised the first European visitors, who carried endemic Eurasian infectious diseases that killed much of the native population.

The Cherokee had traditionally used the area by the confluence for open hunting and meeting grounds. They called it &quot;Untokiasdiyi&quot; or &quot;Tokiyasdi&quot; (ᏙᎩᏯᏍᏗ in Cherokee), meaning &quot;Where they race&quot;, until the middle of the 19th century.

European Americans began to settle in the area of Asheville in 1784, after the United States gained independence in the American Revolutionary War. In that year, Colonel Samuel Davidson and his family settled in the Swannanoa Valley, redeeming a soldier&#x27;s land grant from the state of North Carolina made in lieu of pay. Soon after building a log cabin at the bank of Christian Creek, Davidson was lured into the woods and killed by a band of Cherokee hunters resisting white encroachment. Davidson&#x27;s wife, child, and female slave fled on foot overnight to Davidson&#x27;s Fort (named after Davidson&#x27;s father General John Davidson) 16 miles away.

In response to the killing, Davidson&#x27;s twin brother Major William Davidson and brother-in-law Colonel Daniel Smith formed an expedition to retrieve Samuel Davidson&#x27;s body and avenge his murder. Months after the expedition, Major Davidson and other members of his extended family returned to the area and settled at the mouth of Bee Tree Creek.

The U.S. Census of 1790 counted 1,000 residents of the area, excluding the Cherokee Native Americans as a separate nation. Buncombe County was officially formed in 1792. In the 1800 US Census, some 107 settlers in the county were enslavers, owning a total of 300 slaves. Total county population was 5,812.

The county seat, named &quot;Morristown&quot; in 1793, was established on a plateau where two Indian trails crossed. In 1797, Morristown was incorporated and renamed &quot;Asheville&quot; after North Carolina Governor Samuel Ashe.

In the 1800s, James McDowell established land for burial of slaves belonging to his and the Smith families in Asheville. His son William Wallace McDowell continued this practice, setting aside about two acres of land for this purpose.

===Civil War===

On the eve of the Civil War, James W. Patton, son of an Irish immigrant, was the largest enslaver in the county, and had built a luxurious mansion, known as The Henrietta, in Asheville. Buncombe County had the largest number of prominent enslavers in Western North Carolina, many in the professional class based in Asheville, numbering a total of 293 countywide in 1863.

Asheville, with a population of about 2,500 by 1861, remained relatively untouched by battles of the Civil War. The city contributed companies to the Confederate States Army and to the Union Army. For a time, an Enfield rifle manufacturing facility was located in the town.

The war did not reach Asheville until early April 1865, when the &quot;Battle of Asheville&quot; was fought at the present-day site of the University of North Carolina at Asheville. Union forces withdrew to Tennessee, which they had occupied since 1862. They had encountered resistance in Asheville from a small group of Confederate senior and junior reserves, and recuperating Confederate soldiers in prepared trench lines across the Buncombe Turnpike. The Union force had been ordered to take Asheville only if they could accomplish it without significant losses.

An engagement was fought later that month at Swannanoa Gap, as part of the larger Stoneman&#x27;s Raid throughout western North Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee. Union forces retreated in the face of resistance from Brig. Gen. James Green Martin, commander of Confederate troops in western North Carolina. Later, Union forces returned to the area via Howard&#x27;s Gap and Henderson County. In late April 1865, North Carolina Union troops from the 3rd North Carolina Mounted Infantry, under the overall command of Union Gen. George Stoneman, captured Asheville. After a negotiated departure, the 2,700 troops left town, accompanied by &quot;hundreds of freed slaves&quot;.

Later, the federal troops returned and plundered Asheville, burning a number of Confederate supporters&#x27; homes in Asheville.

George Avery was among 40 enslaved people known to have traveled with the troops to Tennessee. There he enlisted in the U.S. Colored Troops. He returned to Asheville after being discharged in 1866. After the war, he was hired by his former enslaver William W. McDowell to manage the South Asheville Cemetery, a public place for black burials. This is the oldest and largest black public cemetery in the state. By 1943, when the last burial was conducted, it held remains of an estimated 2,000 people.

===1880s===

On October 3, 1880, the Western North Carolina Railroad completed its line from Salisbury to Asheville, the first rail line to reach the city. Almost immediately it was sold and resold to the Richmond and Danville Railroad Company, becoming part of the Southern Railway in 1894. With the completion of the first railway, Asheville developed with steady growth as industrial plants increased in number and size, and new residents built homes. Textile mills were built to process cotton from the region, and other plants were set up to manufacture wood and mica products, foodstuffs, and other commodities.

The distance between Hendersonville and Asheville of the former Asheville and Spartanburg Railroad was completed in 1886. By that point, the line was operated as part of the Richmond and Danville Railroad until 1894 and controlled by the Southern Railway afterward.

Asheville had the first electric street railway lines in the state of North Carolina, the first of which opened in 1889. These were replaced by buses in 1934.

Three people were lynched in Asheville in the 1880s: John Humphries (1888), Hezekiah Rankin (1891), and Bob Brackett (1897). The three men were memorialized with historic markers in 2021 through a project launched by the Equal Justice Initiative.

===1900s===


In 1900, Asheville was the third-largest city in the state, behind Wilmington and Charlotte. Asheville prospered in the decades of the 1910s and 1920s. During these years, Rutherford P. Hayes, son of President Rutherford B. Hayes, bought land, and worked with the prominent African-American businessman Edward W. Pearson Sr. to develop his land for residential housing known as the African-American Burton Street Community. Hayes also worked to establish a sanitary district in West Asheville, which became an incorporated town in 1913, and merged with Asheville in 1917.

The Asheville Masonic Temple was constructed in 1913, under the direction of famed architect Richard Sharp Smith, a Freemason. It was the meeting place for local Masons through much of the 20th century.

On July 15–16, 1916, the Asheville area was subject to severe flooding from the remnants of a tropical storm which caused more than $3 million in damage. Areas flooded included part of the Biltmore Estate, and the company that ran it sold some of the property to lower their maintenance costs. This area was later developed as an independent jurisdiction known as Biltmore Forest, which is now one of the wealthiest in the country.

The Great Depression hit Asheville quite hard. On November 20, 1930, eight local banks failed. Only Wachovia remained open with infusions of cash from Winston-Salem. Because of the explosive growth of the previous decades, the per capita debt owed by the city (through municipal bonds) was the highest in the nation. By 1929, both the city and Buncombe County had incurred over $56 million in bonded debt to pay for a wide range of municipal and infrastructure improvements, including City Hall, the water system, Beaucatcher Tunnel, and Asheville High School. Rather than default, the city paid those debts over a period of fifty years.

From the start of the depression through the 1980s, economic growth in Asheville was slow. During this time of financial stagnation, most of the buildings in the downtown district remained unaltered. As a result, Asheville has one of the most impressive, comprehensive collections of Art Deco architecture in the United States.

In 1959, the City Council purchased property partially located in neighboring Henderson County for the development of Asheville Regional Airport. The North Carolina General Assembly passed a bill to redraw the boundaries of Buncombe and Henderson counties to include the proposed airport property entirely in Buncombe, allowing Asheville to annex the complete site.

The last passenger train to serve Asheville, a coach-only remnant of the Southern Railway&#x27;s &quot;Carolina Special&quot;, made its last run on December 5, 1968.

From the 1950s to the 1970s, urban renewal displaced much of Asheville&#x27;s African-American population. Asheville&#x27;s neighborhoods of Montford and Kenilworth, now mostly white, used to have a majority of black home owners.

Since the late 20th century, there has been an effort to maintain and preserve the South Asheville Cemetery, in the Kenilworth neighborhood. It is the largest public black cemetery in the state, holding about 2000 burials, dating from the early 1800s and slavery years, to 1943. Fewer than 100 of the graves are marked by tombstones.

===2000s to present===
In 2003, Centennial Olympic Park bomber Eric Robert Rudolph was transported to Asheville from Murphy, North Carolina, for arraignment in federal court.

In September 2004, remnants of Hurricanes Frances and Ivan caused major flooding in Asheville, particularly at Biltmore Village. In 2006, the Asheville Zombie Walk was organized for the first time, starting a tradition that lasted until 2016.

In July 2020, the Asheville City Council voted to provide reparations to Black residents for the city&#x27;s &quot;historic role in slavery, discrimination and denial of basic liberties&quot;. The resolution was unanimously passed, and Asheville committed to &quot;make investments in areas where Black residents face disparities&quot;. Also in 2020, efforts were made to remove or change several monuments in the city that celebrated the Confederate States of America or slave owners. In June 2021, Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer was one of 11 U.S. mayors to form Mayors Organized for Reparations and Equity (MORE), a coalition of municipal leaders dedicated to starting pilot reparations programs in their cities.

=== Hurricane Helene ===
In September 2024, Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic, record-breaking flooding of the French Broad and Swannanoa rivers, devastating Asheville and surrounding areas of Western North Carolina. The full extent of the damage was difficult to gauge in the immediate aftermath due to loss of critical infrastructure, including electrical, cellular telephone, and other communications services. Early reports indicated hundreds of downed trees, damaged homes, and blocked local roads. The municipal water system was catastrophically damaged, leaving most of Asheville without running water. Buildings and bridges were washed away and landslides cut off access to several major interstates including I-40 and I-26, leaving the area largely isolated from the outside.

==Geography==

Asheville is located in the Blue Ridge Mountains at the confluence of the Swannanoa River and the French Broad River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.85%) is water.

Asheville is west of Hickory, northwest of Charlotte, and southwest of Winston-Salem.

===Climate===
Asheville features a climate that borders between a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) and an oceanic climate (Trewartha: &quot;Do&quot;) with noticeably cooler temperatures than the rest of the Piedmont region of the Southeast due to the higher elevation; it is part of USDA Hardiness zone 7a. The area&#x27;s summers in particular, though warm, are not as hot as summers in cities farther east in the state, as the July daily average temperature is and there is an average of only 9.4 afternoons with + highs annually; the last time a calendar year passed without a single reading was as recently as 2009. Moreover, warm mornings where the low remains at or above are much less common than afternoons. Winters are cool, with a January daily average of and highs remaining at or below freezing on 5.5 afternoons.

Official record temperatures range from on January 21, 1985 to on August 21, 1983; the record cold daily maximum is on February 4, 1895, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is on July 17, 1887. Readings as low as or as high as rarely occur, the last occurrences being January 7, 2014 and July 1, 2012, respectively. The average window for freezing temperatures is October 17 to April 18, allowing a growing season of 181 days.

Asheville is located in the Appalachian temperate rainforest and precipitation is relatively well spread, though the summer months are slightly wetter, and averages annually, but has historically ranged from in 1925 to in 2018. Snowfall is sporadic, averaging per winter season, but actual seasonal accumulation varies considerably from one winter to the next; accumulation has ranged from trace amounts in 2011–12 to in 1968–69. Freezing rain often occurs, accompanied by significant disruption. Hail is not uncommon during the spring and summer, accompanied by intense severe thunderstorms but the number of days with thunderstorms varies dramatically from year to year ranging from as few as 15 days in 2008 to as many as 44 in 2018. The month that usually experiences the most thunderstorms in Asheville is in July but number of days with thunderstorms in July has ranged from as many as 18 days in 2016 to as few as two days in 2008.

===Sustainability and environmental initiatives===
The city of Asheville is home to a Duke Energy Progress coal power plant near Lake Julian. This power plant is designated as having Coal Combustion Residue Surface Impoundments with a High Hazard Potential by the EPA. In 2012 a Duke University study found high levels of arsenic and other toxins in North Carolina lakes and rivers downstream from the Asheville power plants coal ash ponds. Samples collected from coal ash waste flowing from the ponds at the Duke Energy Progress plant to the French Broad River in Buncombe County contained arsenic levels more than four times higher than the EPA drinking water standard, and levels of selenium 17 times higher than the agency&#x27;s standard for aquatic life. In March 2013 the State of North Carolina sued Duke Energy Progress in order to address similar environmental compliance issues. In July 2013 Duke Energy Corp. and North Carolina environmental regulators proposed a settlement in the lawsuit that stated coal ash threatened Asheville&#x27;s water supply. The settlement called for Duke to assess the sources and extent of contamination at the Riverbend power plant in Asheville. Duke was to be fined $99,100. However, following the coal ash spill in Eden, North Carolina, the North Carolina DENR cancelled all previous settlements with Duke Energy.

The city of Asheville claims a clear focus on sustainability and the development of a green economy. For Asheville, this goal is defined in their Sustainability Management Plan as: &quot;Making decisions that balance the values of environmental stewardship, social responsibility and economic vitality to meet our present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.&quot; As part of the Zero Waste AVL initiative, which began in 2012, each resident receives &quot;Big Blue&quot;, a rolling cart in which they can put all of their materials unsorted. Residents can recycle a great variety of materials and &quot;in this first year of the program 6.30% of waste was diverted from the landfill for recycling.&quot;

The Asheville City Council&#x27;s goal is to reduce the overall carbon footprint 80% by 2030. This means 4% or more reduction per year. In 2009 the reduction was made when the &quot;City installed over 3,000 LED street lights, managed its water system under ISO 14001 standards for environmental management, improved the infrastructure and management of many of its buildings, and switched many employees to a 4-day work week (which saves emissions from commuting).&quot; Asheville is recognized by the Green Restaurant Association as the first city in the U.S. to be a Green Dining Destination (significant density of green restaurants).

====Controversy====
In 2009, a group of Asheville citizens challenged the legitimacy of Cecil Bothwell&#x27;s election to the City Council, citing the Constitution of North Carolina, which does not permit atheists to hold public office. Bothwell has described himself as a &quot;post theist&quot; rather than an atheist, and is a member of a local Unitarian Universalist congregation. The opponents to his election never filed suit. In response to the charge, legal scholars explained that the U.S. Supreme Court held in &quot;Torcaso v. Watkins&quot; that religious tests for political office are unconstitutional.

Bothwell served his four-year council term and was re-elected in 2013. He was defeated in the primary when he ran for a third term in 2017.

While the city council elections are non-partisan, party politics may enter into play, as Republican and Democratic party members back their registered members&#x27; candidacy. An effort by the council to return to partisan elections was defeated by voters in a referendum held in November 2007.

==History==

In 1916, a substantial flood in Asheville, North Carolina, damaged the Biltmore Estate. The Biltmore Company sold the affected land to lessen the upkeep and tax burden. The town of Biltmore Forest was chartered in 1923 and was developed on this land. The first houses were built on White Oak Road. In 1929, Asheville annexed a portion of Biltmore Forest, but that action was reversed in 1935 by an act of the North Carolina legislature.

The Judge Junius G. Adams House, Raoulwood (Thomas Wadley Raoul House) and Gunston Hall are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Black Mountain is a town in Buncombe County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 8,426 at the 2020 United States census. It is part of the Asheville Metropolitan Statistical Area. The town is named for the old train stop at the Black Mountain Depot and is located at the southern end of the Black Mountain range of the Blue Ridge Mountains in the Southern Appalachians.

==History==
Black Mountain in its present form was incorporated on March 4, 1893. The first recorded inhabitants of the area were the Cherokee. A road was built through the area in 1850 and a railroad followed in 1879.

The Black Mountain College Historic District, Black Mountain Downtown Historic District, Blue Ridge Assembly Historic District, Dougherty Heights Historic District, Rafael Guastavino Sr., Estate, Intheoaks, Monte Vista Hotel, South Montreat Road Historic District, and Thomas Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In September 2024, Black Mountain was severely impacted by flooding from Hurricane Helene. The town&#x27;s power, water, and sewer systems went down for days. Roads and bridges were washed away. The headquarters and distribution center for the Ingles supermarket chain is based in Black Mountain. The company&#x27;s local facilities were flooded, leading to mass closures, shortages, and payment processing issues at grocery stores across the chain.

==About the town==
The downtown area has many eclectic shops, attracting seasonal tourism, a main staple of the local economy. There are also many quaint bed and breakfasts. The town is near several Christian retreat areas including Ridgecrest and Montreat Conference Center.

Black Mountain College was formerly located near the town, but the Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center, dedicated to the experimental educational institution&#x27;s history, is now located in downtown Asheville. Black Mountain is also the site of the Swannanoa Valley Museum. The Black Mountain Center for the Arts is located down the street from the museum. In 2002 the community raised 1.2 million dollars to buy the old Town Hall and convert it into the Art Center.

&quot;Black Mountain News&quot; is a weekly newspaper covering Black Mountain and the Swannanoa Valley area.

==Geography==
Black Mountain is located in eastern Buncombe County. The town of Montreat borders Black Mountain to the north, and the unincorporated community of Swannanoa is on the western border. U.S. Route 70 (State Street) is the main road through the center of town. Interstate 40 passes just to the south of downtown, with access from exits 64 and 65. Via I-40, it is west to Asheville and east to Morganton.

The Swannanoa River flows from east to west through the town, rising just to the east at Swannanoa Gap on the crest of the Appalachians. The Swannanoa River flows west to the French Broad River, part of the Tennessee River basin that ultimately flows to the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River, while Swannanoa Creek east of the gap is part of the Catawba River-Santee River system, reaching the Atlantic Ocean north of Charleston, South Carolina.

<doc id="127724" wikidata="Q2025717" url="?curid=127724" title="Fairview, Buncombe County, North Carolina">
<text>Fairview is a census-designated place (CDP) in Buncombe County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 2,678 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Asheville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The William Nelson Camp Jr. House, John A. Lanning House, Dr. Cireo McAfee McCracken House, and Sherrill&#x27;s Inn are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Martin Gash bought 76 acres on Cripple Creek (later Gash&#x27;s Creek) on November 27, 1793. Marshes which attracted buffalo had to be drained in order to use the land.

This area contains rich farm valleys and protective mountain walls, stewarded by the Cherokee people and other indigenous groups for 10,000 years or more before European settlers arrived in the late 18th century. As was the case with Martin Gash&#x27;s land, many of the marshes were drained and the creeks were channeled to make farmland more usable for settler forms of agriculture and export of crops such as Tobacco.

<text>Coffs Harbour, locally nicknamed Coffs, is a coastal city on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales, Australia, north of Sydney, and south of Brisbane. It is one of the largest urban centres on the North Coast, with a population of 78,759 as per 2021 census. 

The Gumbaynggirr people are Traditional Owners of Coffis Harbour and the surrounding area, they have occupied this land for many thousands of years.

Coffs Harbour&#x27;s economy was once based on timber and agriculture. Over recent decades, tourism has become an increasingly important industry for the city. Once part of a region known as the Bananacoast, today the tourist city is part of a wider region known as the Coffs Coast.

The city has a campus of Southern Cross University, and a campus of Rural Faculty of Medicine University of New South Wales, a public and a private hospital, several radio stations, and three major shopping centres. Coffs Harbour is near numerous national parks, including a marine national park.

There are regular passenger flights each day to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane departing from Coffs Harbour Airport. Coffs Harbour is also accessible by road, by NSW TrainLink, and by regular bus services.

==Geography==
Coffs Harbour is a regional city along the Pacific Highway between Newcastle and the Gold Coast. It has become a major service centre for those living between South West Rocks in the south and Grafton to the north.

Sawtell, south along Hogbin Drive from the city has become a satellite suburb of Coffs Harbour; it is increasingly referred to as being part of the city instead of its own entity as a town.

The surrounding region is dominated by coastal resorts and apartments with hinterland hills and mountains covered by forests, banana and blueberry plantations, and other farms including macadamia nuts, cucumbers, and tomatoes. It is the only place in New South Wales where the Great Dividing Range meets the Pacific Ocean.

The greater Coffs Harbour city is broken up into several suburb and precinct areas, including:
* Red Hill
* South Coffs
* West Coffs
* Coffs Harbour Jetty
* Park Beach
* Sandy Beach
* Diggers Beach
* Korora, West Korora
* Sapphire Beach
* Moonee Beach
* Emerald Beach
* North Boambee Valley
* Boambee, Boambee East
* Toormina
* Sawtell
* Bonville

The city is surrounded by many towns and villages in the Coffs Coast region, including:
* Coramba
* Nana Glen
* Corindi Beach and Red Rock
* Karangi
* Ulong
* Upper Orara
* Woolgoolga

==History==
The traditional inhabitants of the Coffs Harbour region are the Gumbaynggirr people, who have occupied the land for thousands of years, forming one of the largest coastal Aboriginal nations in New South Wales. Their nation stretches from the Nambucca River in the south to around the Clarence River in the north and to the Great Dividing Range in the west.

By the early 1900s, the Coffs Harbour area had become an important timber production centre. Before the opening of the North Coast railway line, the only way to transport large items of heavy but low value, such as timber, was by coastal shipping. This meant sawmillers on the North Coast were dependent on jetties either in rivers or off beaches for exporting their timber. Timber tramways were constructed to connect the timber-getting areas, the sawmills and jetties built into the ocean at Coffs Harbour.

==Origin of place name==
The Gumbaynggirr language name, for the harbour for which the town is named, is &quot;Gitten Mirreh&quot; which translates as &#x27;big moon&#x27;.

Coffs Harbour, the town, owes its name to John Korff, a ship builder and ship owner, who named the area Korff&#x27;s Harbour after he was forced to take shelter from a storm there in 1847.

The name was accidentally changed by the surveyor for the Crown when he reserved land in the area during 1861.

== Heritage listings ==
Coffs Harbour has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 1 Breakwater Road: Ferguson&#x27;s Cottage
*Coffs Harbour timber jetty, Jordan Esplanade

==Demographics==

According to the 2021 Census the population of suburban Coffs Harbour is 78,759. This is an increase from 72,944 in 2016. 52.6% of the population is female in contrast to the national average of 50.7%. The average age is 43, which is higher than the national average of 38. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 5.6% of the population.

75.5% of residents reported being born in Australia; higher than the national average of 66.7%. Other than Australia the most common countries of birth are England (3.2%), New Zealand (1.3%), Myanmar (1.1%), India (0.9%) and Germany (0.5%). 62.2% of residents also reported both their parents being born in Australia, considerably higher than the national average of 47.3%. 82.1% of people spoke only English at home.

The top religious affiliations in Coffs Harbour are Catholic 20.0%, Anglican 17.9% and Presbyterian and Reformed 3.9%. 29.3% declared no religion and 11.1% did not submit a response.

== Climate ==
Coffs Harbour has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot; according to the Köppen climate classification system) with hot, wet summers and short mild winters, with marked seasonality of rainfall. The city is relatively sunny, receiving 122.1 clear days annually, higher than Brisbane and Cairns but not as sunny as Townsville. Summers are moderately hot, wet and humid. Winters are mild, albeit featuring cool nights, with light to moderate rainfall. There is a history of floods in the city, with major flooding occurring in the years 1917, 1938, 1950, 1963, 1974, 1977, 1989, 1991, 2009 and 2021.

==Attractions==

Coffs Harbour was the hub for a thriving banana industry. One of the biggest attractions is the Big Banana, one of the first of Australia&#x27;s Big Things (it celebrated its 50th birthday in 2015), with the World&#x27;s Largest Banana celebrating the region&#x27;s best-known export. There is also a popular underwater diving spot on a small natural reef.

The Coffs Harbour Jetty is an historically important timber wharf where coastal shipping once moved the timber from the hinterland. It was listed on the NSW State Heritage Register on 25 June 2021, recognising its significance &quot;as the longest coastal timber jetty built by the Harbours and Rivers Section of the NSW Public Works department in the 19th century.&quot; The jetty area is the subject of planning from 2018 by Council and consultants to develop a cultural precinct and rejuvenated residential area.

Nearby, the Solitary Islands Marine Park preserves a diverse underwater ecosystem that mirrors the terrestrial biodiversity, covering the southern limit of northern tropical species and the northern limits of the southern temperate species. Muttonbird Island is accessible by walking along the breakwater from the harbour, with the nature reserve protecting a significant wedge-tailed shearwater breeding site. The Muttonbird Island footpath leads to a viewing platform where whales are often spotted between June and November.

There are many national parks, reserves and marine parks surrounding the city, including:
* Bellinger River National Park (west of Bellingen in the Bellinger headwaters)

==Pacific Highway Upgrade==

The Pacific Highway cuts through the centre of the city of Coffs Harbour. As a part of the Pacific Highway Upgrade (organised from the NSW government), has started working on building a deviation containing three interchanges and three tunnels through the ridge line. The new highway starts at Englands Road, runs west to Coramba Road, and joins near Campbell Close and Solitary Islands Way, Korora. It&#x27;s achievements to motorists include saving up to 12 minutes of driving time, bypassing up to 12 sets of traffic lights, making trips from and to Coffs Harbour easy for local residents, and improving safety for all motorists. The project was approved in November 2020 and is due to be open to traffic in late 2026 and completed in 2027 at a cost of $2.2AU billion

<text>Weaverville is a town in Buncombe County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 4,567 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Asheville metropolitan area.

==History==
Chartered in 1875 and named for Michael Montraville Weaver who gave the land for the town, Weaverville sits along the Dry Ridge (named by the Indians for its relatively arid conditions). The Treaty of Holston signed in 1786 cleared the way for settlers to move into the area. Among the first settlers were John and Elizabeth Weaver, parents of the town&#x27;s founder. Early residents, friends, and relatives soon began gathering for religious camp meetings near the south end of College Street. On land first known as the Reems Creek Camp Grounds, a large conference house (built in the 1830s) housed the Methodist assembly which became the first school in the area in 1840.

By 1862, 121 families were in the Reems Creek area, many owning more than . Weaverville College, chartered in 1873, attracted many families. The former president&#x27;s house is now the Dry Ridge Bed and Breakfast. A four-year college, it was downsized in 1912 to junior college status, merging in 1934 with Rutherford and Brevard Colleges to continue in Brevard. In 1912 a public school (grades 1-7) was located at the west end of Church Street. The first full-time public school on Main Street was established in 1921. In 1927 grades 11-12 attended school in the Robinsom-Lotspeich house (now the Inn on Main Street Bed and Breakfast). Weaverville High School, built by the WPA in 1927, opened on the south end of Main Street, but later merged secondary-school operations with four other area schools (Flat Creek, Red Oak, French Broad, and Barnardsville) in 1954 to form North Buncombe High School . 

Business and private residences were built along Main Street. Dr. J.A. Reagan was the first mayor, and with a town council Weaverville began to develop roads and walkways. A police chief developed law and order. With the arrival of electricity and the arrival of an electric trolley the town prospered. Land development boomed. Post offices, starting in 1860, were located in McClure&#x27;s log cabin, Vandiver&#x27;s Store (now Blue Mountain Pizza) and Shope&#x27;s Furniture. A new post office was completed in 2001 on North Main.

The Fire Department was established in 1912, with the first truck purchased in 1922. A fire station was built in 1958 on Merchants Alley, behind the 12 N. Main Town Hall. It moved into the Reagan Building on S. Main Street and then finally onto Monticello Road.

North Carolina&#x27;s Civil War governor, Zebulon B. Vance, was born in the nearby Reems Creek community. Reems Creek itself flows through Weaverville adjacent to the town&#x27;s Lake Louise Park. The mill at Reem&#x27;s Creek was portrayed in &quot;Picturesque America,&quot; a famous 19th century work of illustrated American scenes published in 1872.

The Dr. John G. &amp; Nannie H. Barrett Farm, Brigman-Chambers House, Joseph P. Eller House, Weaverville United Methodist Church, and Zebulon H. Baird House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Woodfin is a town in Buncombe County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 6,123 as of the 2010 census. It is part of the Asheville Metropolitan Statistical Area. The town is named for Nicholas Washington Woodfin, a renowned lawyer and statesman of early North Carolina, under whom Governor Zebulon Vance clerked as an attorney. Woodfin is the only municipality bearing the name Woodfin in the United States. The town was incorporated in 1971, although the community itself dates back to at least the mid-19th century.

==History==
The town&#x27;s history is closely tied to manufacturing. Much of the remaining early housing stock is characteristic of early 20th century mill villages. Many neighborhoods within the community bear names tied to the industry, such as &quot;Martel Village&quot; and &quot;Company Bottom&quot;. The decline of American industry in the 1970s and &#x27;80s brought a decline to the economy of Woodfin as well. The loss of many manufacturing jobs led to a decline in population and property values. Starting in the 1990s, however, the town has experienced new residential growth, due primarily to the influx of new residents to western North Carolina. Woodfin&#x27;s economy today is a mix of large- and small-scale manufacturing, combined with a variety of residential and commercial districts. It is the 115th largest municipality in the state.

North Carolina Electrical Power Company Electric Generating Plant was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.

<text>Connelly Springs is a town in Burke County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 1,669 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Hickory–Lenoir–Morganton Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The first settler on record in the area was William Lewis Connelly, a colonel in the North Carolina militia, for whom the town was named. In 1838, Colonel Connelly built a log home and operated a way station where fresh horses could be made available for the stagecoach line that ran from Salisbury to Asheville. He also took in boarders who were looking to spend a night during a long journey. During this time, a settlement grew up around the way station, which was then known as Happy Home, and a post office was established.

In 1885, the area was found to have a mineral spring, thought to be beneficial in healing a large number of diseases. Mrs. Elmira Connelly opened her spring to others, and before long people were arriving by horse and wagon, and by train, to cart water away in five-gallon demijohns. The popularity of Mrs. Connelly&#x27;s mineral spring led to the construction of the Connelly Mineral Springs Hotel, a 50-room hotel that was built along the railroad tracks, and near the mineral spring discovered by Mrs. Connelly. As the town grew, it became known as Connelly Springs, and was incorporated as such on May 4, 1920.

Morganton is one of the principal cities in the Hickory-Lenoir-Morganton, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
An influx of European settlers over the Blue Ridge Mountains led Morganton to become the first chartered town in western North Carolina in 1784.

On April 17, 1865 there was a small skirmish fought in Morganton, as part of Stoneman&#x27;s 1865 raid through North Carolina.

Public welfare facilities, such as the North Carolina School for the Deaf: Main Building and Western North Carolina Insane Asylum, were first authorized by the state legislature in the late 19th century.

In the early 20th century, textile mills were developed in the Piedmont as industry left union-dominated areas of the Northeast United States. During the century, however, these industrial jobs gradually moved offshore.

In the late 20th century, Morganton and Burke County, was still largely rural and with big poultry farms, which became locations for industrial-scale poultry processing plants. These jobs attracted many new immigrants to the state from Central America, leading to an increase in the Latino population in the area.

In 2006, an explosion at Synthron, a paint additive chemical manufacturer in Morganton, left 13 injured and one dead.

A -tall bronze statue of a Confederate soldier—erected in 1918—is located atop a stone pedestal in the Old Burke County Courthouse square.

<text>Concord ( ) is the county seat of and most populous city in Cabarrus County, North Carolina, United States. The city had a population of 105,240 at the 2020 census. Concord is the second-most populous city in the Charlotte metropolitan area, tenth-most populous city in North Carolina and 287th-most populous city in the U.S.

The city was a winner of the All-America City Award in 2004. Located near the center of Cabarrus County in the Piedmont region, it is northeast of Uptown Charlotte. Concord is the home to some of North Carolina&#x27;s top tourist destinations, including NASCAR&#x27;s Charlotte Motor Speedway and Concord Mills.

==History==

Concord, located in today&#x27;s rapidly growing northeast quadrant of the Charlotte metropolitan area, was first settled about 1750 by German and Scots-Irish immigrants. The name Concord means &quot;to bring into harmony&quot;. This name was chosen after a lengthy dispute between the German Lutherans and Scotch-Irish Presbyterians over where the county seat should be located. Concord is considered a relatively old town by US standards, as it was incorporated in 1806. Today, markers identifying the original town limits can be seen in the downtown area.

As county seat, Concord became a center of trade and retail for the cotton-producing region, especially on court days. The downtown would be crowded with farmers and townfolk, in addition to lawyers and their clients. During the antebellum era, wealth was built by planters through the cultivation of cotton as a commodity crop; the work was done by enslaved African Americans.

Based on wealth from cotton as a commodity crop and through textile manufacturing, Concord&#x27;s white planters and business owners built some significant homes in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; they range along North and South Union Street and Edgewood Avenue. Within the North Union Historic District is Memorial Garden. Located on , the garden winds through the 200-year-old cemetery of the First Presbyterian Church.

Located in the Piedmont, Concord became a site of industrialization with cotton mills in the late 19th century. Among the owners of the new mills in the area were men of the rising black middle-class in Wilmington, North Carolina, such as Warren Clay Coleman, John C. Dancy (appointed as collector of customs at the port), and others, who organized Coleman Manufacturing Company in 1897. They built and operated what is believed to have been the first cotton mill owned by blacks in the nation. They hoped to promote economic security for people of color. However, the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898, with white attacks on black areas of the city, caused many deaths, as well as destroying homes and businesses built by blacks since the Civil War. In 1900, Dancy was among more than 2000 blacks who left the city permanently after the riot. He moved to Washington, DC, appointed as the federal Recorder of Deeds, and had served until 1910. The mill operated under black ownership through 1904, hitting difficult times after Coleman died. The brick mill building was later taken over by Fieldcrest Cannon. It was enlarged and added on to, nearly doubling its square footage.

From the time of incorporation in the late 1700s through the 1970s, Concord&#x27;s jurisdiction was centered around the downtown area. Since then, most annexations have taken place west of the center-city area toward Charlotte. Portions of the city limit boundary adjoin the Cabarrus/Mecklenburg County line.

<text>Hudson is a town in Caldwell County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 3,776 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Hickory–Lenoir–Morganton Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Hudson originated as a sawmill camp, with timber being the initial attraction to the area. Among early settlers to Hudson, were the Hudson brothers, Monroe and Johnny. The name Hudson was selected honoring these two brothers as the name of the community. &quot;Hudsonville&quot; would come into being in 1880, with the &quot;ville&quot; being dropped in 1889 due to mail confusion with Hendersonville. In 1905, Hudson was incorporated as a town.

In 1904, businessman B.B. Hayes of the textile business came to Hudson and established the first big industry, the Hudson Cotten Mill (known as Shuford Mills). The Hudson Cotton Manufacturing Company was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.

==Overview==
Hudson is located in the foothills region of Western North Carolina. Located in an area once known mainly for its furniture industry, businesses in Hudson today include Shurtape Technologies, Kincaid Furniture, BeoCare, and Sattler USA. According to the 2020 census, Hudson has a population of approximately 3,800 people. During the day this jumps to well over 10,000 due to those who work in town and those who attend school at Caldwell Community College and other surrounding schools.

Hudson&#x27;s landmarks, most of which are located near the main street area, include the Hudson Uptown Building (known as the &quot;HUB&quot;, site of the former Hudson Elementary school, now an event space), local businesses along main street, and Caldwell Community College from US 321.

The town has two parks. Redwood Park features a playground, swimming pool, basketball and tennis courts, several ballfields, and a dog park. The Hickman Windmill Park &amp; Depot Museum features the Historic Hudson Depot and Red Caboose, as well as a 19th century windmill. Music is often performed in the park, most notably Pickin&#x27; in the Park during summer months which later evolved into the Hudson Hometown Concert Series.

On clear days, Hudson offers views of the Blue Ridge Mountains, including Grandfather Mountain. These views can be seen over Hudson Middle School directly off the US Highway 321 Hudson exit. Hudson also hosts Caldwell County&#x27;s oldest continuous event, The Butterfly Festival, which is held the first Saturday every May with attendance of between 8,000–10,000 people.

<doc id="127749" wikidata="Q2028342" url="?curid=127749" title="Lenoir, North Carolina">
<text>Lenoir ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Caldwell County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 18,263 at the 2020 census. Lenoir is located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. To the northeast are the Brushy Mountains, a spur of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Hibriten Mountain, located just east of the city limits, marks the western end of the Brushy Mountains range.

Lenoir is one of the principal cities in the Hickory-Lenoir-Morganton, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Lenoir was established in 1841 and incorporated in 1851. The city was named for Revolutionary War general and early North Carolina statesman William Lenoir, who settled north of present-day Lenoir. His restored home, Fort Defiance, is a tourist attraction.

===Early history===
The original settlement of Lenoir was known as Tucker&#x27;s Barn, after a Tucker family that settled on the north side of Lower Creek around 1765. The homestead eventually served as a voting precinct, a muster ground, a store, and a place for celebrations. When Caldwell County was formed in 1841, a commission was appointed to choose a location for the county seat. One member proposed the south side of Lower Creek (today, the Whitnel area) because of its view of the Blue Ridge Mountains. However, since most of the county&#x27;s population was on the north side of Lower Creek, the Tucker&#x27;s Barn site was chosen, where Lenoir is today.

=== American Civil War ===
During Gen. Stonemans final raid in 1865 during the American Civil War, he passed through Lenoir on March 28 and again on April 15. On March 29, 1865, a small skirmish took place near Lenoir.

Along with this; multiple Civil War companies were formed with soldiers from Lenoir and Caldwell County. These companies served in various different regiments within the Confederate States Army. There were also Southern Unionists who supported the Union within Caldwell County, with local Confederate deserters and resisters joining them as the war went on.

Following the Civil War, Clinton A. Cilley, a Union Army Medal of Honor recipient, would settle in Lenoir. He worked as a lawyer, eventually becoming a civic leader, judge, and Mayor of Lenoir.

===National Register of Historic Places locations===
In addition to Fort Defiance, the Caldwell County Courthouse, Lenoir Downtown Historic District, Lenoir Grammar School, Lenoir High School, Mary&#x27;s Grove, and Edgar Allan Poe House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Lenoir is southeast of the center of Caldwell County, and is bordered to the south by the towns of Hudson and Cajah&#x27;s Mountain, and to the southwest by the town of Gamewell.

The city is at the intersection of U.S. Highways 64 and 321. US 64 leads east to Statesville and southwest to Morganton, while US 321 leads north to Boone and southeast to Hickory.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Lenoir has a total area of , all land. The city is in the valley of Lower Creek, between the Brushy Mountains to the east and the Blue Ridge Mountains to the west. Lower Creek flows southwest to the Catawba River valley.

===Climate===
Lenoir has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;), with cool to mild winters and warm, humid summers. Due to the city&#x27;s proximity to the Blue Ridge Mountains, temperatures tend to be slightly cooler than areas to the east.

==Economy==
The Broyhill Furniture company, one of the largest furniture companies in the United States and part of Heritage Home Group (KPS Capital Partners), recently closed its headquarters in Lenoir. Furniture in general has historically been one of the city&#x27;s largest employers. The Bernhardt, Kincaid, and Fairfield furniture companies are based in or around Lenoir. In the 1990s, these companies began changing their business models to reflect consumer trends, and closed several of Lenoir&#x27;s furniture factories. Recent consolidations of area furniture facilities (Thomasville, Taylorsville, North Wilkesboro, etc.) have netted modest gains in positions in the industry around Lenoir. The medical and education sectors are now the area&#x27;s largest employers.

Google, Inc. has a server farm, or &quot;data center&quot;, in Lenoir. There was controversy over the nature, amount, and potential benefits of economic development incentives that the City of Lenoir, Caldwell County, and the State of North Carolina gave Google in 2007 to induce the company to build the server farm. The less celebrated benefits of the investment have been construction employment and spending, a small-time server farm investment just outside downtown, Dacentec, as well as local charitable and educational endeavors by Google.

Wholesale nurseries, shipping large balled and burlap plants to landscapers in metropolitan areas, have been a strong source of employment in Lenoir over the last 75 years. Local nurseries employ around two percent of the local population.

<text>Bogue is a town in Carteret County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 684 in 2010.

==History==
June 1899 was marked by two murders in the tiny town. On June 9, Elijah Weeks, a white merchant, was found dead in his store. The next day Lewis Patrick, a young black man, was detained because he had a piece of pork in his possession. He was arrested and taken to the county jail in Beaufort. On the night of June 14, 1899, he was taken from jail by a mob and out to a roadside, where he was shot to death, with his body left by the road for others to find. This was the only known lynching in Carteret County.

<text>In product development, an end user (sometimes end-user) is a person who ultimately uses or is intended to ultimately use a product. The end user stands in contrast to users who support or maintain the product, such as sysops, system administrators, database administrators, information technology (IT) experts, software professionals, and computer technicians. End users typically do not possess the technical understanding or skill of the product designers, a fact easily overlooked and forgotten by designers: leading to features creating low customer satisfaction. In information technology, end users are not customers in the usual sense—they are typically employees of the customer. For example, if a large retail corporation buys a software package for its employees to use, even though the large retail corporation was the &quot;customer&quot; that purchased the software, the end users are the employees of the company, who will use the software at work.

==Context==
End users are one of the three major factors contributing to the complexity of managing information systems. The end user&#x27;s position has changed from a position in the 1950s (where end users did not interact with the mainframe; computer experts programmed and ran the mainframe) to one in the 2010s where the end user collaborates with and advises the management information system and Information Technology department about his or her needs regarding the system or product. This raises new questions, such as: Who manages each resource?, What is the role of the MIS Department? and What is the optimal relationship between the end-user and the MIS Department?

==Empowerment==
The concept of end-user first surfaced in the late 1980s and has since then raised many debates. One challenge was the goal to give both the user more freedom, by adding advanced features and functions (for more advanced users) and adding more constraints (to prevent a neophyte user from accidentally erasing an entire company&#x27;s database). This phenomenon appeared as a consequence of consumerization of computer products and software. In the 1960s and 1970s, computer users were generally programming experts and computer scientists. However, in the 1980s, and especially in the mid-to-late 1990s and the early 2000s, everyday, regular people began using computer devices and software for personal and work use. IT specialists needed to cope with this trend in various ways. In the 2010s, users now want to have more control over the systems they operate, to solve their own problems, and be able to customize the systems to suit their needs. The apparent drawbacks were the risk of corruption of the systems and data the users had control of, due to their lack of knowledge on how to properly operate the computer/software at an advanced level.

For companies to appeal to the user, it took primary care to accommodate and think of end-users in their new products, software launches, and updates. A partnership needed to be formed between the programmer-developers and the everyday end users so both parties could maximize the use of the products effectively. A major example of the public&#x27;s effects on end user&#x27;s requirements were the public libraries. They have been affected by new technologies in many ways, ranging from the digitalization of their card catalog, the shift to e-books, e-journals, and offering online services. Libraries have had to undergo many changes in order to cope, including training existing librarians in Web 2.0 and database skills, to hiring IT and software experts.

==End user documentation==

The aim of end user documentation (e.g., manuals and guidebooks for products) is to help the user understand certain aspects of the systems and to provide all the answers in one place. A lot of documentation is available for users to help them understand and properly use a certain product or service. Due to the fact that the information available is usually very vast, inconsistent or ambiguous (e.g., a user manual with hundreds of pages, including guidance on using advanced features), many users suffer from an information overload. Therefore, they become unable to take the right course of action. This needs to be kept in mind when developing products and services and the necessary documentation for them.

Well-written documentation is needed for a user to reference. Some key aspects of such a documentation are:
* Specific titles and subtitles for subsections to aid the reader in finding sections
* Use of videos, annotated screenshots, text and links to help the reader understand how to use the device or program
* Structured provision of information, which goes from the most basic instructions, written in plain language, without specialist jargon or acronyms, progressing to the information that intermediate or advanced users will need (these sections can include jargon and acronyms, but each new term should be defined or spelled out upon its first use)
* Easy to search the help guide, find information and access information
* Clear end results are described to the reader (e.g., &quot;When the program is installed properly, an icon will appear in the left-hand corner of your screen and the LED will turn on...&quot;)
* Detailed, numbered steps, to enable users with a range of proficiency levels (from novice to advanced) to go step-by-step to install, use and troubleshoot the product or service
* Unique Uniform Resource Locator (URLs) so that the user can go to the product website to find additional help and resources.

At times users do not refer to the documentation available to them due to various reasons, ranging from finding the manual too large or due to not understanding the jargon and acronyms it contains. In other cases, the users may find that the manual makes too many assumptions about a user having pre-existing knowledge of computers and software, and thus the directions may skip over these initial steps (from the users&#x27; point of view). Thus, frustrated user may report false problems because of their inability to understand the software or computer hardware. This in turn causes the company to focus on perceived problems instead of focusing on the actual problems of the software.

==Security==

In the 2010s, there is a lot of emphasis on user&#x27;s security and privacy. With the increasing role that computers are playing in people&#x27;s lives, people are carrying laptops and smartphones with them and using them for scheduling appointments, making online purchases using credit cards and searching for information. These activities can potentially be observed by companies, governments or individuals, which can lead to breaches of privacy, identity theft, by, blackmailing and other serious concerns. As well, many businesses, ranging from small business startups to huge corporations are using computers and software to design, manufacture, market and sell their products and services, and businesses also use computers and software in their back office processes (e.g., human resources, payroll, etc.). As such, it is important for people and organizations to need know that the information and data they are storing, using, or sending over computer networks or storing on computer systems is secure.

However, developers of software and hardware are faced with many challenges in developing a system that can be both user friendly, accessible 24/7 on almost any device and be truly secure. Security leaks happen, even to individuals and organizations that have security measures in place to protect their data and information (e.g., firewalls, encryption, strong passwords). The complexities of creating such a secure system come from the fact that the behaviour of humans is not always rational or predictable. Even in a very-well secured computer system, a malicious individual can telephone a worker and pretend to be a private investigator working for the software company, and ask for the individual&#x27;s password, a dishonest process called phishing. As well, even with a well-secured system, if a worker decides to put the company&#x27;s electronic files on a USB drive to take them home to work on them over the weekend (against many companies&#x27; policies), and then loses this USB drive, the company&#x27;s data may be compromised. Therefore, developers need to make systems that are intuitive to the user in order to have information security and system security.

Another key step to end user security is informing the people and employees about the security threats and what they can do to avoid them or protect themselves and the organization. Clearly underlining, the capabilities and risks makes users more aware and informed whilst they are using the products.

Some situations that could put the user at risk are:
* Auto-logon as administrator options
* Auto-fill options, in which a computer or program remembers a user&#x27;s personal information and HTTP cookies 
* Opening junk emails of suspicious emails and/or opening/running attachments or computer files contained in these 
* Email can be monitored by third parties, especially when using Wi-Fi connections
* Unsecure Wi-Fi or use of a public Wi-Fi network at a coffee shop or hotel
* Weak passwords (using a person&#x27;s own name, own birthdate, name or birthdate of children, or easy-to-guess passwords such as &quot;1234&quot;)
* Malicious programs such as viruses

Even if the security measures in place are strong, the choices the user makes and his/her behavior have a major impact on how secure their information really is. Therefore, an informed user is one who can protect and achieve the best security out of the system they use. Because of the importance of end-user security and the impact it can have on organizations the UK government set out a guidance for the public sector, to help civil servants learn how to be more security aware when using government networks and computers. While this is targeted to a certain sector, this type of educational effort can be informative to any type of user. This helps developers meet security norms and end users be aware of the risks involved.
Reimers and Andersson have conducted a number of studies on end-user security habits and found that the same type of repeated education/training in security best practices can have a marked effect on the perception of compliance with good end-user network security habits, especially concerning malware and ransomware.

==Law==
In end-user license agreements, the end user is distinguished from the value-added reseller who installs the software or the organization that purchases and manages the software.

Certain American defense-related products and information require export approval from the United States Government under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and Export Administration Regulations. In order to obtain a license to export, the exporter must specify both the end user and the end use for undertaking an end-user certificate.

In the UK, there exist documents that accompany licenses for products named in the end user undertaking statements.

<text>Emerald Isle is a town in Carteret County, North Carolina, United States. It is part of the Crystal Coast and is located entirely on Bogue Banks. The population was 3,847 at the 2020 census, but as many as 50,000 tourists each week inhabit the area during the summer season, filling up vacant rental properties that do not count toward official census results.

Today, the oceanfront is lined with large and small homes, duplexes, condominiums, and one oceanfront hotel. Emerald Isle has a family-oriented atmosphere.

Recent beach renourishment projects in North Carolina, including Emerald Isle, have been both praised and questioned.

==History==

From about 1 AD to colonial times, Emerald Isle was home to Native Americans. Later, the area was settled by a small number of whalers and fishermen.

In the 1920s, Henry Fort, who owned the Emerald Isle beaches and land surrounding them, hoped to open a large summer tourist attraction and ocean resort. Fort worked with developers, but the plans never materialized. After his death, his daughter Anita Maulick inherited Emerald Isle.

In 1951, seven people purchased the stretch of island for $350,000 from Anita Maulick. Emerald Isle was sliced into 54 blocks of , each going from ocean to sound. The partners drew from a hat for the ownership of blocks. Because they wanted Emerald Isle to be family-oriented, the owners limited commercial development and mobile homes to five blocks each.

In 1960, ferry service began, providing wider access to the Bogue Banks beaches of modern-day Emerald Isle.

In 1971, the Cameron Langston Bridge was opened to provide access from Cedar Point to the western end of Bogue Banks and Emerald Isle. The bridge, spanning the Intracoastal Waterway, offers a great view of Bogue Sound and Bogue Banks. The opening of the bridge increased island development.

Emerald Isle is a popular vacation spot for families and is also known for excellent fishing and a wealth of marine life. Its beaches are a favorite location for nesting sea turtles, which are protected by federal law.

==Geography==
Emerald Isle is located in southwestern Carteret County at the western end of Bogue Banks, a barrier island. To the south is the Atlantic Ocean, and to the north is Bogue Sound separating the island from mainland North Carolina. The town extends to the western tip of the island, ending at Bogue Inlet, while to the east the town is bordered by Indian Beach.

<doc id="127763" wikidata="Q2024887" url="?curid=127763" title="Harkers Island, North Carolina">
<text>Harkers Island is a census-designated place (CDP) in Carteret County, North Carolina, United States. The population of Harkers Island was 1,207 at the 2010 census. Harkers Island is unincorporated and receives most public services, including law enforcement and public education, from Carteret County. A membership cooperative provides the island with electric and water services. Major industries on the island include fishing, boat building, tourism, and waterfowl decoy carving.

Formerly named Davers Ile and Craney Island, Harkers Island was occupied by Native Americans of the Coree tribe when the first European explorers arrived in the 16th century. Ownership of Harkers Island was first titled to Farnifold Green, a native of the Carolina colony, by the lord proprietor in 1707. Ebenezer Harker purchased the island in 1730, settled there with his family, and built a plantation and boat yard. The island became known as Harkers Island soon after his death. A large immigration of islanders fleeing the hurricane-ravaged Outer Banks in 1899 dramatically increased the island population, which largely depended on fishing and boat building. Separated from the mainland for centuries, many Harkers Island residents speak a distinct dialect of English, earning them the nickname &quot;Hoi toiders.&quot;

==History==
Before the arrival of European explorers and settlers, Harkers Island was inhabited by Native Americans of the Coree tribe, who likely spoke a language of the Algonquian family, like most coastal tribes. The nearby Core Sound and Core Banks are named after the Coree. The Coree left little in the way of evidence of permanent habitation on Harkers Island, except for a large mound of oyster shells at Shell Point on the eastern end of the island. Similar shell mounds were found by Europeans on the Shackleford Banks and other islands of the Outer Banks. The exact purpose of the mounds for the Coree remains unknown, but varying cultures of indigenous peoples in the Southeast had been building major earthwork mounds since 3500 BCE, the Middle Archaic period, usually related to religious and ceremonial uses.

In 1584, an English expedition financed by Sir Walter Raleigh and led by Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe explored the North Carolina coast for a suitable site for the first English colony in North America. Two Native Americans, Wanchese and Manteo, accompanied the expedition back to England in the fall of 1584. According to local island legend, Wanchese was a Coree from Harkers Island. The island was first charted on the maps drawn by John White during the 1584 expedition, but it was unnamed at the time. The island appears on a 1624 map of the greater Virginia coastline created by Captain John Smith. On that map, the island is labeled &quot;Davers Ile&quot;, probably for Sir John Davers, one of the founders of Jamestown in 1607.

On December 20, 1707, Farnifold Green obtained the first patent for land in the Core Sound area from the lord proprietor of the Carolina colony, which had been established by the English monarch Charles I in 1633. This patent included Harkers Island, which was then known as Craney Island. On June 25, 1709, Green sold the island to William Brice for £5, who on the very same day sold it to Thomas Sparrow III (1674–1717) for £10. Sparrow soon sold the island to Thomas Pollock, who would twice be governor of North Carolina (from 1712 to 1714 and again in 1722). Pollock did not take up residence on the island, but had several farm buildings erected and then leased to settlers. The 1720 lease to a Captain Stone was £3 a year. Thomas Pollock&#x27;s son George inherited the island upon his father&#x27;s death on August 30, 1722.

===Settlement of Ebenezer Harker===
George Pollock sold Craney Island to Ebenezer Harker on September 15, 1730, for £400 and &quot;one boate twentey foot long with oars &amp; mast&quot;. Harker had immigrated to Massachusetts from England on a ship that set sail from Wales. Living in Boston, Harker had been involved in the whaling trade, and became familiar with the North Carolina coast during this time. Harker had moved to Beaufort, North Carolina, by 1728, where he was appointed a tax collector for the whale oil revenue generated in the area. After purchasing the island, Harker took up residence there with his family and began building a small plantation and boat yard. Harker sold half of the island to his nephew John Stevens of Onslow County on March 8, 1733, for £300, with many restrictions on its agricultural use. Prohibited from farming or ranching the land for profit, Stevens eventually sold his half of the island back to his uncle on June 9, 1737, for just £180.

The Harker plantation and boat building facility were located at the western end of the island, near Harker Point, and grew to support an extended family with three sons, two daughters, and at least nine African slaves. Ebenezer would be the last sole landowner of the island. In 1752, he deeded approximately of the island to his daughter Hepsobeth and her husband Nathan Yeomans as a wedding gift. On his death in 1762, his son Zachariah inherited the western third of the island, an adult slave woman named Vilet, and a young female slave named Daisie.

Another son, James, inherited the eastern third of the island, an adult slave woman named Hague and a young male slave named Peter. Ebenezer Jr. inherited the central third of the island, an adult male slave named Jeffrey, and a young male slave named Sutton. Hepsobeth inherited &quot;one barrel of corn&quot;, and Ebenezer&#x27;s other married daughter, Sarah Freshwater, was given a female slave named Hope. The fate of an elderly female slave named Badge and a young male slave named Ben was left to the heirs to decide. The will referred to &quot;Craney Island&quot;; the name &quot;Harkers Island&quot; was only adopted after Ebenezer&#x27;s death.

The sons of Ebenezer prospered on Harkers Island. Ebenezer Jr. was elected Sheriff of Carteret County in 1758. Zachariah Harker developed a salt works on the western third of Harkers Island in 1776. In the following years, Zachariah and his brothers became supporters of the American Revolution, and Zachariah was appointed one of five captains in the Carteret Regiment fighting against the British. Harkers Island was involved in the Battle of Beaufort, North Carolina. Revolutionaries used warehouse facilities on Harkers Island to store provisions sought by British troops who had seized the nearby county seat of Beaufort. Thirteen men guarding the stores on Harkers Island, probably led by Zachariah Harker, repulsed British troops in a brief battle on April 6, 1782. The first national census of 1790 recorded 16 white residents and 13 slaves on Harkers Island. By 1800, the population had expanded to 26 white residents, 16 slaves, and 7 &quot;others&quot;, probably those of mixed race or freed slaves. Ebenezer Jr., James, and Zachariah Harker died in 1803, 1814, and 1824, respectively.

===Nineteenth century===
Harkers Island remained sparsely populated until the latter part of the 19th century. The island saw no direct military conflict in the American Civil War; however, Union warships anchored near the island to control access to Bogue Sound and Core Sound during the Battle of Fort Macon. The besieged Confederate garrison at Fort Macon surrendered on April 26, 1862. Harkers Island and the surrounding area remained under Union control for the duration of the war. The few, if any, descendants of the Harker slaves still living on the island likely left soon after emancipation. The vast majority of the freed slaves in the coastal societies of Carteret and Craven counties either emigrated to other parts of the state, or moved into their own, separate communities, such as Davis Ridge, the North River Community, and Craven Corner.

In 1864, the first school on the island was established when Miss Jenny Bell came to Harkers Island from Boston, sponsored by the Northern Methodist Episcopal Church. A fish oil factory was built on the island in 1865 and remained operational until 1873. A small milling facility was built on the west end of the island in 1870 by Louie Larson, an immigrant from Norway, but it closed before the turn of the 20th century. Most island residents continued to earn a subsistence living from boat building or fishing.

===The Hurricane of 1899===
Harkers Island saw an influx of new residents after hurricanes in 1896 and 1899 devastated the communities established on the nearby Core Banks and Shackleford Banks. Mostly fishermen and whalers, the people of the Outer Banks began openly debating the merits of moving after the Hurricane of 1896. William Henry Guthrie of Diamond City was one of the first to relocate, buying of land on Harkers Island in 1897. Some others moved to more sheltered locations on the coast, but most Shackleford residents remained on the Banks. Diamond City was by far the largest town in that area of the coast, with over 700 inhabitants.

Three years later, another hurricane hit the Carolina coast, and this time the disaster for the residents of the Shackleford Banks was total. Diamond City was completely destroyed by the August 17 Hurricane of 1899. The storm ravaged the Banks&#x27; protective sand dunes, and washed away nearly all of the top soil. Orchards and maritime forest on the Banks soon began dying from the salt left behind by the storm surge. Homes were ripped from their foundations, shattered, or submerged. Even graves in the local cemeteries were uprooted and disturbed. A botanist who visited the Banks after the storm described the landscape as completely devastated.

Many families used boats to move what was left of their houses, plank by plank, from the Outer Banks to Harkers Island where they could rebuild. Some settled on the Guthrie property, which he began to subdivide. Others purchased or leased land on the island anywhere they could. Some emigrated to Morehead City, on the mainland, where they built a new neighborhood soon nicknamed &quot;The Promised Land&quot;. The last resident had left Diamond City by 1902. In the five years between 1895 and 1900, the population of Harkers Island expanded fourfold from just 13 extended families to over 1,000 residents. The island had gone from being one of the smallest communities in Carteret County to one of the largest.

Elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) proselytized extensively on Harkers Island after the hurricanes. Many of the refugees from Diamond City, uprooted physically and emotionally by the devastating hurricanes, converted to the Latter Day Saints, and soon outnumbered the members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, which had been founded on the island in 1875. A national wave of anti-Mormon sentiment was sparked by the Smoot Hearings in 1904, fueling fears that Mormons secretly continued to practice polygamy. The relationship between the Mormons on Harkers Island and their neighbors deteriorated.

Residents threw rocks and oyster shells through the windows of the LDS meetinghouse and fired at least one gunshot into the building. In 1906, arsonists burned the meetinghouse to the ground. Organized Mormon religious services did not resume on Harkers Island until 1909. A new LDS meetinghouse was constructed on the island in the 1930s. Despite these difficult beginnings, Harker&#x27;s Island has one of the highest percentages of residents as members of the Latter-day Saints of any locality in North Carolina.

===Twentieth century===
Harkers Island gradually became more connected to North Carolina and the world at large early in the 20th century. With the influx of new residents from the Outer Banks, a post office was opened in 1904. The first public road to extend the length of the island, Harkers Island Drive, was built in 1926 when a footpath was widened and paved with the oyster shells from the Coree mound at Shell Point. The road was hard paved by the county in 1936. The road and the post office were connected to the mainland by a ferry service until the Earl C. Davis Memorial Bridge was built in 1941.

A wooden structure, the bridge connected the northwestern end of Harkers Island to the small town of Straits directly to the north. The location of the bridge was a matter of some local controversy at the time. Most islanders would have preferred a bridge to the west, connecting the island directly to the city of Beaufort with its commercial infrastructure and the county hospital. Local politics and the shorter distance to Straits likely dictated the final location of the bridge. A local political effort to relocate the bridge during its renovation to a steel structure in 1966 also failed.

The 1933 Outer Banks Hurricane which made landfall on September 15 would forever change the economy of Harkers Island. The storm was blamed for at least 21 fatalities in North Carolina (although none on Harkers Island) and an estimated US$1 million of damage. The storm surge damaged fisheries and inland waterways, but there was one unexpected beneficial result. Retreating storm surge and heavy rainfall combined to carve out a new channel in the Banks, separating the Core Banks from the Shackleford Banks near the Cape Lookout Lighthouse. This new channel gave Harkers Island fishermen a new, direct access route to offshore fishing grounds. The new channel was named Barden Inlet after US Senator Graham Barden, who sponsored legislation to require that the United States Army Corps of Engineers use dredging equipment to maintain the new channel.

More economic opportunity for Harkers Island came as the country began pulling itself out of the Great Depression. Electrification came to the island in 1939. The Harkers Island Rural Electric Authority was the first electrical cooperative in the United States to supply power to members through a submarine cable system. In November 1941, the construction of a new United States Marine Corps Air Station at Cherry Point, to the northwest of Harkers Island, brought more wage-earning jobs to the local economy. When the United States entered World War II, Harkers Island was on the front lines. German submarines patrolled the North Carolina coast and sank merchant shipping traffic, especially oil tankers. Island residents could watch the tankers burning offshore at night. Further improvements in the island&#x27;s utility services would have to wait until after the war. Telephone service finally arrived in 1948.

===The National Seashore===
The Shackleford Banks played an important economic role for the people of Harkers Island throughout much of the 20th century. Islanders continued to use the Banks for livestock grazing, including sheep, goats, cattle, and horses. Harkers Island fishermen first built seasonal camps and later cottages on the Banks. A herd of wild horses on the Shackleford Banks provided new colts every spring to those from Harkers Island who rounded them up. The islanders viewed the improvements of cottages, horse corrals, and campsites as an extension of their economic livelihood on Harkers Island.

All of that would change with the government determination to acquire the barrier islands for public park land. The state of North Carolina began purchasing land on the Core Banks and Shackleford Banks in 1959 with the intention of creating a state park. The federal government became interested a few years later, and envisioned the Outer Banks of North Carolina being included in a string of national seashores stretching the length of the United States Atlantic coast. After negotiations between the state of North Carolina and the United States Department of the Interior, the United States Congress passed a law authorizing the creation of a Cape Lookout National Seashore, which was signed into law by President Lyndon Baines Johnson on March 10, 1966.

Conversion of the Banks to a national park brought much turmoil to Harkers Island. Many Harkers Island fishermen discovered that cottages and other improvements they had made on the Banks were on land that would be condemned. Many land deeds had recording errors, some had been poorly surveyed, and natural changes to the shorelines affected many claims. Few of the cottages that had been built were on land that the builders owned. Legal eviction and condemnation proceedings lasted into the 1980s. The creation of the park also ended the open grazing of livestock on the Banks by December 31, 1985. A herd of wild horses, allegedly descended from Spanish horses that swam to shore from shipwrecks in the 16th century, was allowed to remain on the Banks. In late December of that year, a series of arson fires destroyed most of the major structures on the Shackleford Banks, including a recently constructed park visitor center. An inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation failed to discover the arsonists.

The creation of the National Seashore marked the end of a lifestyle practiced by many Harkers Island residents. Fishing and boat building remain important components of the community&#x27;s economy, but are increasingly augmented with tourism. Visitors arrive at Harkers Island seeking access to the National Seashore, for sport fishing opportunities, and to experience the local cultural heritage of the islands.

==Geography==
Harkers Island is located south of the center of Carteret County. The Harkers Island census-designated place covers the entire island and extends slightly out into the surrounding water. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 41.76%, is water. At its highest point, the island is above mean sea level, in an area known as the &quot;sand hole&quot;, on the western end of the island, made up of mostly white sand on rolling dunes.

Harkers Island is protected from the Atlantic Ocean by the barrier islands of the Shackleford Banks to the south and the Core Banks to the east. The body of water directly south of the island is Back Sound. To the east is Core Sound, to the north is The Straits, and to the northwest is the mouth of the North River. The Straits are shallow but navigable by those with local experience. There are two small bays on the north side of the island, Westmouth Bay and Eastmouth Bay. North of Eastmouth Bay is Browns Island, which is accessible only by boat. Harkers Island Road, designated as State Road 1335, connects the island to the mainland by the Earl C. Davis Memorial Bridge, a steel swing bridge built in 1968 to replace a wooden bridge built in 1941.

==Government and services==
Harkers Island is unincorporated and receives most public services, including law enforcement and public education, from Carteret County. Law enforcement on the island is provided by the Carteret County Sheriff Department. The only public school on the island, Harkers Island Elementary, educates students from kindergarten through fifth grade, and is operated by Carteret County Public Schools. The school has won the state Battle of the Books competition twice and has been to the competition for four years in a row; both are state records. There are no hospitals on Harkers Island. The local newspaper is the &quot;Carteret County News-Times&quot;, published in Morehead City. Electricity service and drinking water are both provided by the Harkers Island Electric Membership Corporation, a cooperative operating as both a Rural Electrical Authority and the manager of the water system for the Harkers Island Sanitary District since 1969.

==Economy==
Major industries on the island include fishing, boat building, tourism, and waterfowl decoy carving. In 2013, the United States Census Bureau reported 22 business establishments on Harkers Island employing 107 people. A majority of the business fall into Retail and Food Services (9) or Construction, Manufacturing, and Warehousing (9). The businesses in the latter category are almost entirely associated with boat building, boat repair, and boat storage. Many island residents are self-employed in the fishing trade. A relatively large percentage of island residents are over the age of 65 and/or retired.

Commercial fishing has always been an important component of the island economy. Historically, this trade included whaling and the hunting of dolphins. Until ice became available in the 1920s, the primary commercial catch was mullet, which was caught near the beaches of Shackleford Bank and Core Bank and salted on shore. In the late 19th century, the Core Sound area produced 80% of the salted mullet sold on the United States east coast. An ice plant was built in nearby Beaufort in 1920, and fish houses were established on the island to process fish and shellfish. Some bay areas on the north side of the island have been developed for harvesting cultured shellfish. In addition to mullet, the commercial fishing industry of Harkers Island brings in oysters, clams, shrimp, scallops, crabs, spot, croaker, trout, flounder, bluefish, and mackerel.

Tourism on Harkers Island is becoming a more important part of the local economy. The National Park Service operates the Cape Lookout National Seashore Visitors Center on Harkers Island. Ferry service from Harkers Island is one of the principal means of tourist access to Cape Lookout and the Shackleford Banks. Big-game fishing operations cater to growing demand for sport fishing in the area. Other tourism related industries include gift shops, local artists, hotels, and restaurants. Despite growth in the tourist trades and the local effort to make the island a top destination for waterfowl enthusiasts, Harkers Island continues to have some of the least developed tourist facilities on the Crystal Coast.

One of the fastest growing industries on the island is waterfowl enthusiast tourism. Founded in 1987 at the Harkers Island home of Wayne Davis, the Core Sound Decoy Carvers Guild organized the first of what would become an annual festival in December 1998. The first Core Sound Waterfowl Festival attracted 1,800 attendees. Later renamed the Core Sound Decoy Festival, the event has attracted over 10,000 tourists to Harkers Island. The Core Sound Waterfowl Museum, operated by a separate board of directors from the Carvers Guild, is a major year-round tourist attraction for the island. The museum building is a structure located on property leased from the National Park Service. In addition to telling the history of local waterfowl and the traditions of decoy carving, the museum operates exhibits of local historical interest. The museum also hosts events during Waterfowl Weekend, held on the same weekend as the Decoy Festival. The festival weekend is the most important annual event for the Harkers Island tourism economy.

==Local dialect==
With a long history of physical and economic isolation from mainland North Carolina, residents of Harkers Island and other Outer Banks islands, such as Ocracoke, have developed a distinct dialect of English, commonly referred to as High tider, that can be traced back to that of the Elizabethan period. The dialect of Harkers Island developed in almost complete isolation for over 250 years. Harkers Island English shares features with other regional dialects of the US Atlantic coast. Pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammatical constructions can be traced to eastern and southwestern England. The dialect has survived because the community continues to depend on traditional trades, like fishing, boat building, and decoy carving, and the coastal tourism trade developed on Harkers Island much later than islands like Ocracoke.

Pronunciation in Harkers Island English can be different from the English spoken in the rest of the United States. &quot;High tide&quot; spoken in Harkers Island English might sound like &quot;hoi toide&quot;, &quot;time&quot; sounds like &quot;toime&quot;, &quot;fish&quot; is pronounced close to &quot;feesh&quot;, &quot;fire&quot; sounds like &quot;far&quot;, and &quot;cape&quot; is pronounced &quot;ca&#x27;e&quot;. Words with &quot;oi&quot; substitute the pronunciation &quot;er&quot;: &quot;Toilet&quot; sounds like &quot;terlet&quot;. Words with a short &quot;a&quot; substitute schwa: &quot;crabs&quot; become &quot;crebs&quot;. Words beginning with &quot;i&quot; frequently receive a prefix aspirated &quot;h&quot;: &quot;it&quot; becomes &quot;hit&quot;. Words ending in a vowel are frequently suffixed with an &quot;r&quot;. The traditional word for a porch across the width of a building, &quot;piazza&quot;, loses the &quot;t&quot; of the Italian pronunciation and becomes &quot;poyzer&quot;.

Thus, &quot;Hit&#x27;s so hot the blue crebs hev come up on the poyzer to git in the shade,&quot; and &quot;hit was so rough there were whiteceps in the terlet.&quot; Another phrase is &quot;The ersters hev arroived;&quot; the large fish with a prominent dorsal fin is a &quot;sherk&quot;. The island dialect has also retained anachronistic vocabulary in regular usage. Some examples include &quot;mommick&quot;, meaning to frustrate or bother, &quot;yethy&quot;, describing stale or unpleasant odor, and &quot;nicket&quot;, meaning a pinch of something used as in cooking. The islanders have also developed unique local words used in regular conversation, including &quot;dingbatter&quot; to refer to a visitor or recent arrival to the island, and &quot;dit-dot,&quot; a term developed from a joke about Morse code, and used to describe any visitor to the island who has difficulty understanding the local dialect.

As many as 500 islanders on Harkers Island are directly descended from the Harkers Island and Outer Banks settlers that developed this distinct dialect. Linguists from North Carolina State University, East Carolina University, and other academic institutions continue to conduct research on the island dialect.

==Education==
It is within the Carteret County Schools district. Residents are zoned to Harkers Island Elementary School, Down East Middle School @ Smyrna, and East Carteret High School.

==Religion==
In 2006, Harkers Island had eight Christian churches. Established churches and religious organizations on Harkers Island include the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Free Grace Wesleyan Church, Grace Holiness Church, Harkers Island Pentecostal Holiness Church, Harkers Island United Methodist Church, Huggins Memorial Baptist Church Parsonage, the Lighthouse Chapel (non-denominational), and the Refuge Fellowship Church (non-denominational).

<text>Morehead City is a port city in Carteret County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 8,661 at the 2010 census. Morehead City celebrated the 150th anniversary of its founding on May 5, 2007. It forms part of the Crystal Coast.

==History==
By the early 1850s, a group of investors had been formed and incorporated a land development project known as the &quot;Shepard Point Land Company,&quot; which purchased of land on the eastern tip of the peninsula bordering the Newport River, known then as &quot;Shepards Point,&quot; which is the present location of Morehead City. The Shepard Point Land Company&#x27;s objective was to take advantage of the natural deep channel of Topsail Inlet, known today as the Beaufort Inlet, which splits Bogue Banks from Shackleford Banks and provides access to Morehead City, Beaufort, North Carolina, the Newport River and the Intracoastal Waterway. The Shepard Point Land Company was established to construct a deepwater port to allow another access point for North Carolina timber products to relieve pressure at the port located in Wilmington. To make the port accessible to the interior of North Carolina, the Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad line between Goldsboro and New Bern was completed on April 29, 1858.

North Carolina Governor John Motley Morehead, for whom the city of Morehead City is named, was a principal member of the Shepard Point Land Company investment group. Fully operational rail service began in July 1858 connecting the town to points west, north, and south.

The city of Morehead City was laid out using a grid plan, whereby city blocks were equally laid out with each block consisting of 16 equally divided lots. The city blocks stretched from 1st Street to 15th Street, incorporating a system of alleys forming an &quot;H&quot; shape that enabled businesses and residential homes to be served from the alleys behind them.

Morehead City was officially incorporated by the North Carolina Senate in 1860, at which time the total number of households consisted of only 300 individual families.

The city continued to prosper until the Civil War, when in 1862 it was occupied by Federal troops. The war disrupted commerce, and the economy of the port declined along with the town&#x27;s population. It was not until the 1880s, with the construction of the Atlantic Hotel at the tip of the peninsula and its promotion by the railroad as the &quot;Summer Capital by the Sea,&quot; that the area began to experience a resurgence. The popularity of this particular hotel, with its train depot entrance, grand ballroom, piers, sailing, and ferries to the beaches of Bogue Banks, helped to establish Morehead City as a summer destination.

It was also during the 1880s and 1890s that fishermen who had lived on the island of Shackleford Banks moved on to the mainland (often transporting their houses by boat from the outer banks), settling in the areas between 10th and 15th streets and calling it the Promised Land. These fishermen became the nucleus of the fishing industry that has remained an important part of the town&#x27;s economy.

The Great Depression and World War II markedly altered the character of the town. The traditional downtown area had deteriorated and, as newer stores opened further west, the decay in the old center of town accelerated. Finally, in the 1980s, a renewal began when the town obtained a Community Development Block Grant to replace an aging infrastructure and improve the appearance of the waterfront area. Subsequent grants, private investment, and town monies have maintained the forward momentum, so that the town now has a new sea wall, underground utilities, brick paved walkways with planters along the waterfront, all in the downtown area, and tree-lined streets, renovated houses, new docks and new businesses.

The Morehead City Historic District and Morehead City Municipal Building are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Today&#x27;s community==

Morehead City&#x27;s economy is based predominantly on a variety of ecotourism activities, a growing retirement community, and the Port of Morehead City. The local economy is based further on the Port of Morehead City, light industry and manufacturing, land development, light commercial fishing, sport fishing, and other service-oriented businesses. The town is within easy access of New Bern, Havelock and Jacksonville, North Carolina. Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point is northwest of Morehead City in Havelock, and Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune is west of Morehead City near Jacksonville.
Morehead City is one of two existing ports in North Carolina which primarily export phosphate. The Port of Morehead City features a dry-bulk facility with a 225,000-ton capacity warehouse and extended open storage facilities. SpaceX fairing recovery vessels Ms. Tree and Ms. Chief utilize the port during launch and fairing recovery operations as a safe harbor in the event of inclement weather at sea or if there is an extended launch delay.

Carteret General Hospital in Morehead City is the second largest employer in Carteret County, behind the Carteret County Public Schools.

===Higher education and marine research===
Carteret Community College serves the undergraduate community with two-year associate degree programs focused primarily on trades and service sector occupations. There are several world-class postgraduate programs and research organizations in the area, including the University of North Carolina&#x27;s Institute of Marine Sciences, North Carolina State University&#x27;s Center for Marine Sciences and Technology, and the Duke University Marine Lab in nearby Beaufort.

Morehead City also is home to the Research and Compliance Branch North Carolina Marine Fisheries Division, a governmental organization.

===Inshore and offshore recreational fishing===
Morehead City and the surrounding area is an excellent venue for fishermen of all varieties. There are many opportunities for recreational fishing when in Morehead City because of its pristine estuaries and close proximity to the Continental Shelf and Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream is a powerful, warm and swift Atlantic Ocean current that originates at the tip of Florida and follows the coastline of the eastern United States to Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic Ocean, bringing large sport fish species such as the Atlantic blue marlin and other billfish close to the North Carolina coastline.

Established in 1957, the Big Rock Blue Marlin Tournament draws large crowds of sporting enthusiasts of all types to Morehead City each year to witness some of the largest Atlantic blue marlin catches in North America.

===Scuba diving===
Morehead City and surrounding areas are a popular scuba diving destination, particularly for the many shipwrecks that have led the waters off North Carolina to be nicknamed the &quot;Graveyard of the Atlantic&quot;. Morehead City sits between a number of famous wrecks, including the German submarine U-352, discovered in part by the late Morehead resident George Purifoy.

==Traditional sports==

Morehead City is home to the Morehead City Marlins of the Coastal Plain League, a collegiate summer baseball league. The Marlins play at O&#x27;Neal Field at Big Rock Stadium in Morehead City, and began playing in the 2010 season.

Youth sports in Morehead City include Little League Baseball, soccer leagues, and basketball leagues.

==Geography==
Morehead City is located southwest of the center of Carteret County. It occupies a peninsula bordered to the south by Bogue Sound and to the north and east by the tidal Newport River. Across the river to the east is the town of Beaufort, while to the south across Bogue Sound is Atlantic Beach.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Morehead City has a total area of , of which is land and , or 19.55%, is water.

Amtrak provides a Thruway Bus to Wilson that connects with the daily &quot;Palmetto&quot; train to New York City and Savannah, Georgia, as well as the daily &quot;Carolinian&quot; train to New York City and Charlotte.

Into the early 1950s, the Atlantic and East Carolina Railway ran a daily passenger train to Goldsboro&#x27; s Union Station. The connections at Goldsboro were timed to accommodate a local Southern Railway overnight train (#111/#112, in final years, #11/#112) to parts in central and western North Carolina, comparable to the North Carolina section of the &quot;Carolina Special.&quot;

The North Carolina Department of Transportation as of 2007 was studying the resumption of intercity passenger train service from Raleigh through Goldsboro to Morehead City.

<text>Newport is a town in Carteret County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 4,510 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Newport was officially chartered in 1866. Although the crossroads community on the Newport River was known by that name decades earlier, the area was also known as Bell&#x27;s Corner and Shepardsville in earlier years. It was the location of the Newport Barracks, a Union camp during the American Civil War.

It was also called Shepardsville, in the early 18th century, for Shepard, a local landowner. The naming of &quot;Newport&quot; can be traced to two prevalent theories: the town was called &quot;New Port&quot; to distinguish it from the &quot;Old Port &quot; of Beaufort, N.C.; and the early influx of Quakers from Rhode Island called the town &quot;Newport&quot; in honor of their native Newport, R.I..

Early industry included agriculture, logging, and naval stores, including turpentine production. During the town&#x27;s early history, the Newport River was navigable all the way to Old Topsail Inlet, now known as Beaufort Inlet, which opens to the Atlantic Ocean. The town was home to one of the earliest organized churches in Carteret County, the Newport River Primitive Baptist Church, established 1778. The structure was burned near the end of the Civil War but was soon rebuilt on the corner of Haskett Street and New Bern Street and remains active today.

In 1858, the Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad was completed when the final stretch of rail from Goldsboro through Newport to Beaufort was laid. The community is also the site of numerous Civil War battlefields, forts, and strategic locations. Newport was occupied by Union forces for much of the war.

Part of the town&#x27;s residential area known as the &quot;housing project&quot; was originally developed as housing for civil service employees and military serving at nearby Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point.

==Newport today==
The town government operates as a council–manager government form with a mayor, a town manager, and a five-member town council. Members serve staggered terms.

The town is protected by a paid fire department with an active volunteer force, founded in the 1940s by Leon Mann, Jr. The department also provides emergency medical and ambulance services.

Public schools in Newport include the Carteret Pre-K Center, Newport Elementary School, and Newport Middle School. Newport Consolidated School, a first-through-12th-grade school established in 1926, was demolished in 1966 after the county completed construction of a new consolidated high school, West Carteret High in nearby Morehead City. Members of the Newport Consolidated School Alumni Association operate a small school museum in a depot warehouse owned by the North Carolina Railroad in Newport.

The town was established in 1791 as Caswell Court House and was renamed Yanceyville in honor of U.S. Congressman Bartlett Yancey, Jr. when it was chartered as an incorporated town in 1833.

There are three public schools in Yanceyville as well as a satellite campus for Piedmont Community College. Maud F. Gatewood Municipal Park and Caswell Community Arboretum are popular recreational areas. Yanceyville Municipal Airport serves general aviation aircraft.

==History==
When Person County was created out of Caswell County in 1791, the original county seat, Leasburg, was close to the eastern newly formed boundary line dividing the two. Commissioners were named in the county formation act to create a new county seat and courthouse near the geographical center of present Caswell County. Hence, the village of Caswell Court House (later Yanceyville) was founded.

In 1833, Caswell Court House&#x27;s name changed to Yanceyville when it was chartered as an incorporated town. Years later this initial charter was seemingly forgotten because a municipal charter was obtained from the General Assembly again in 1877. In 1885, the state legislature passed a similar act, but why it was necessary is unknown. In 1899, the act authorizing the town&#x27;s incorporation was repealed. In 1905, Yanceyville was incorporated again, only to have the charter repealed once more in 1915. The town remained an unincorporated community until a successful attempt at reorganization and incorporation occurred in 1986.

The identity of Yanceyville&#x27;s namesake has been a matter of historical debate. The prevailing view is that the town is named after U.S. Congressman Bartlett Yancey, Jr., (1785–1828). Surviving documents had strongly suggested that it was named for Bartlett Yancey, Jr.&#x27;s older brother James Yancey (1768–1829). The elder Yancey was a legislator, merchant, planter, public official, and educator. In 1977, North Carolina historian William S. Powell wrote that the preponderance of evidence supported Bartlett Yancey, Jr., as the town&#x27;s namesake.

Caswell County&#x27;s historic courthouse is a prominent landmark and center of activity in Yanceyville. Its design combines Italian Romanesque and classical features in a manner unique to North Carolina courthouse architecture. Located in the town&#x27;s historic district in Court Square, it has been restored and provides offices for county departments.

A new county courthouse was constructed in the mid-1970s and is located a few blocks north of Court Square. Construction on the preceding historic courthouse began in 1858 during the tail end of the area&#x27;s prosperous &quot;Boom Era.&quot; Built using enslaved labor, it was completed in 1861 amid the early stages of the American Civil War.

If Yanceyville had not been the county seat, it likely would have been abandoned as a ghost town after the war&#x27;s end in 1865. The previous plantation way of life had disappeared. No clear geographic or commercial reason for the town&#x27;s existence remained other than the purpose of functioning as the county&#x27;s seat of government.

With no railroad, major waterway, or ability to attract commerce, Yanceyville was almost entirely reliant on agricultural enterprises in the surrounding county in the decades following the Civil War. These businesses focused mainly on tobacco and were dominated by markets beyond Caswell County. Agricultural practices in Yanceyville during the antebellum period and thereafter had overused the land and caused soil erosion. Gullies were evident on most farms. From 1880 to 1900, the dire economic situation led to a sharp decline in the township&#x27;s population. Such agronomic challenges persisted well into the 20th century.

Improved farming techniques in the 1940s and 1950s curbed further land degradation, which contributed significantly to Yanceyville&#x27;s economic development and revitalization. During the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st, the local economy continued to develop, diversify, and experience growth away from tobacco cultivation.

The Sherrills, of English ancestry, had come from northeast Maryland, most probably trekking through modern Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Virginia.

The community began in 1974 when R.B. Fitch and his late wife Jenny purchased the two-century old dairy farm from Jesse Fearrington. He had inherited the 640 acre property, originally purchased for 100 shillings in 1786 from John Oldham by his great-great-great grandfather, William Cole.

Located midway between Chapel Hill and Pittsboro along U.S. 15-501 in Chatham County, Fearrington currently occupies about .

The Fitches aimed to recreate the smaller villages of England and modeled the Fearrington Village Center after those hamlets long before the term &quot;mixed-use community&quot; had been popularized.

Over the last 30 years the community has grown to include over 1800 residents, a country inn and restaurant (The Fearrington House), a cafe &amp; bar, various shops, and artist studios.

The Fearrington House Country Inn is one of only two AAA five-diamond facilities in the state, earning the Five Diamond designation 15 years in a row, more times than any other accommodation in the Carolinas. The Inn is also North Carolina&#x27;s only five-star hotel, according to Mobil Travel Guide&#x27;s annual rankings.

Belted Galloway cows, the village&#x27;s iconic mascot, were added to the farm in 1983.

==Business and industry==
The town has always been predominantly rural, and most of the business and industry over the years has been centered around the area&#x27;s agricultural heritage, mainly the poultry industry. The town&#x27;s location near the railroad line has helped to keep industry going in the area, although in recent years the town has seen a decline in industry. The town has a Dollar General variety store as well as two restaurants, Lizzie&#x27;s and Rufus&#x27;s.

==Railroad==
Goldston is located on a spur of the Norfolk Southern Railway that runs between Greensboro and Sanford. The railroad was historically important to the growth of the town. The rail line was once part of the now defunct Southern Railway, and prior to that the Atlantic &amp; Yadkin Railway. Until a few years ago many older Southern-marked freight gondolas could be found parked on a side track downtown and at the nearby old Pomona Clay pit.

Most of the rail traffic that comes through town is local freight between Sanford and Greensboro or freight going to the Aberdeen, Carolina and Western Railway, which connects to the southeast of Goldston in the village of Gulf. Most of this freight is composed of grain hopper cars going to local poultry feed mills. Norfolk Southern Right of Way Maintenance equipment and cars are also frequently parked on the side trackage in Goldston.

<text>Pittsboro is a town in Chatham County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 3,743 at the 2010 census and 4,537 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Chatham County.

The town was established in the late 18th century, shortly after the American Revolution, as the county seat for the newly formed Chatham County. In the years leading up to the American Civil War, the economy was dominated by small-scale farms that relied heavily on enslaved labor. In the aftermath of the civil war, racial tensions were high, and the town was noted for a number of lynchings and other racial violence in the late 19th century. Industrialization came to the community in the late 19th century, as a number of rivers cross the area providing locations for mills and factories. Economic and population growth would continue into and throughout the 20th century. As industry moved away from the community, it has in the 21st century transitioned into a bedroom community for the nearby cities of the Research Triangle region.

== History ==

=== Foundation and early years ===
Pittsboro was established as a town in 1785. The Chatham County Court House was built on land belonging to Mial Scurlock, but in 1787 the legislature declared that a town could not be established on Scurlock&#x27;s land. The town&#x27;s trustees instead purchased adjacent land belonging to William Petty and laid out the town. That same year, Pittsboro was officially named the county seat. Although Chatham County is named for William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, Pittsboro is named for his son, William Pitt the Younger.

Pittsboro was once considered as a site for both the University of North Carolina and the state capital. The university was established in Chapel Hill, beginning in 1789. The state capital is Raleigh, east of Pittsboro.

As the county seat, Pittsboro has been a center of trade and local government, including the courts. Many farmers would come into town on the weekend for trade. In 1881 a new county courthouse and jail were built in Pittsboro.

=== Slavery and racial segregation ===
The area did not have large plantations, but farmers also depended on slave labor. In 1860 nearly one-third of the county population was made up of enslaved African Americans. After the Civil War and emancipation, whites used violence and other means to enforce white supremacy and suppress the freedmen&#x27;s vote. The Ku Klux Klan and other supremacist groups were active in the county.

Pittsboro was the scene of a notorious mass lynching of four African Americans in 1885, including a woman. The event earned statewide condemnation. Those lynched were tenant farmers. A masked mob took Jerry Finch, his wife Harriet, and Lee Tyson from jail, where they were being held after arrest as suspects in a robbery/murder case. Harriet Finch was one of four black women to be lynched in the state. They also took and hanged John Pattishall, who was awaiting trial for two other unrelated robbery/murders.

A white mob broke into the Pittsboro jail and seized a 16-year-old boy, Eugene Daniel. He was lynched and then had his body riddled with bullets on September 18, 1921. 

Violence continued during the stress of economic hard times at the end of the century and into the early 20th century, when the state disenfranchised most blacks. This political exclusion lasted until after 1965 and passage of the Voting Rights Act. In 2019, a statue erected in 1907 of a Confederate soldier outside the Chatham County Courthouse in Pittsboro was taken down.

=== Early industrialization ===
Textile mills in the north-central area of the county along the Haw River, Rocky River, and Deep River provided new manufacturing jobs to workers who had lost farm holdings due to economic depressions of the 1870s and early 1880s. It was the beginning of industrialization around Pittsboro.

=== Chatham County Courthouse fire ===
On March 25, 2010, the Chatham County Courthouse, while undergoing a $415,000 exterior renovation, caught fire. Smoke was first reported in the area around 4:15 pm; the fire was dispatched to the Pittsboro Fire Department around 4:45 pm. By 5 pm, smoke was reported to be rising from out of the clock tower, which was surrounded by scaffolds. The building was evacuated safely.

The building suffered severe damage to the clock tower and the third floor. It was reported that the fire had destroyed all the computers and records, but there were offsite copies and the information was recoverable.

On March 26, 2010, at approximately 1:30 am, the clock tower collapsed onto the main building, but the building as a whole was damaged only on the second floor. Damage in the rest of the building was from water and smoke effects. Overall 11 fire departments participated in the fire efforts.

The fire marshal&#x27;s investigation into the fire determined that it was caused by a soldering torch that ignited wood near the soffit. Workers attempted to extinguish the blaze, but were unsuccessful. On March 31, 2010, the Chatham County Commissioners voted to rebuild the courthouse. It reopened on April 20, 2013.

== City government ==
The mayor of Pittsboro is elected at-large. The current mayor is Kyle Shipp. The town&#x27;s five members of the Board of Commissioners are also elected at-large. They are Pamela Baldwin, J.A. (Jay) Farrell, John Foley, John Bonitz, and James Vose. The Board of Commissioners hires a town manager to administer daily operations of the city; the current town manager is Jonathan Franklin. 

Pittsboro holds elections for the Mayor and three seats on the Board of Commissioners every four years in the off-year after each midterm election. Two Pittsboro Commissioners are elected in the off-year after each presidential election.

<text>Siler City is a town in western Chatham County, North Carolina, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town&#x27;s population was 7,702.

==History==
Siler City began when Plikard Dederic Siler and his wife, Elizabeth Hartsoe Siler, settled about four miles north of the town&#x27;s current location. The couple briefly lived in Pennsylvania, then Virginia, and then settled near Lacy&#x27;s Creek (the location near today&#x27;s Siler City). They had 10 children.

In recent years, Siler City has become a suburb of Greensboro and the Research Triangle Park. Since 1997, it has developed as a center of industrial-scale poultry processing, and attracted numerous immigrants and Latinos for the jobs. The changing demographics have challenged the town as it works to absorb the new population and different cultures. In three years, the majority-Latino soccer team of the high school qualified for the state championship, creating a new fan base.

The Bowen-Jordan Farm, Cadmus N. Bray House, Bray-Paschal House, East Raleigh Street Historic District, Gregson-Hadley House, Former High Point Bending and Chair Company, Hotel Hadley, North Third Avenue Historic District, Siler City City Hall, Siler City Commercial Historic District, Siler City High School, Snipes-Fox House, William Teague House, and Burdett Woody House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Andrews is a town in Cherokee County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 1,667 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the Valley River was inhabited by Muscogee people. They constructed platform mounds in the centers of their towns. At least 14 existed within the limits. By the beginning of the 18th century, the Cherokee had pushed the Muscogee out and taken over their townsites. Many of the towns retained their original names.

Andrews was the site of two substantial Cherokee sister towns, Tomotla and Konohete. The meaning of Tomotla is lost. Konehete or Gu&#x27;nahitun&#x27;ya on the other hand, can be translated to mean &quot;Long Place&quot; or &quot;Long Valley.&quot; The remains of the Andrews Mound survived until 1975, when the land owner bulldozed the structure after it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. All of the other mounds have been destroyed either through farming or malicious land owners.

The area was originally called Jamesville, and then the Whitaker Settlement, in honor of settler James Whittaker. The Old Tatham House at the base of Pisgah Road near Andrews was built in 1833. The two-story log cabin built by Thomas Tatham is the oldest surviving structure in the county. In 1852, Cherokee County’s first industry, a tannery northeast of what would become Andrews, was established by James Stewart. The town’s first school was a log structure built on Fairview Road in the early 1880s. In the late 1880s, Col. Alexander Boyd Andrews, second vice president of the Richmond and Danville Railroad, bought 50 acres in the area to build a commissary for the railway. Trains began visiting in 1891.

=== The town&#x27;s establishment ===

In 1905, the town of Andrews was incorporated, with David Samuel Russell appointed as the first mayor. The Franklin Pierce Cover House, First Baptist Church, and Walker&#x27;s Inn are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On October 27, 1906, the dedication of the Andrews Public School occurred, and its first classes began in August 1907 in the Masonic Lodge. The building was used until its demolition in the summer of 1961. The first known brick house in the county, the John Tatham House, was north of Andrews. It was destroyed in the early 1900s.

After African-Americans were forced out of Cumming, Georgia, in 1912, some came to Andrews and started a community called Happytop. A Carnegie library was built in Andrews in 1914. It was demolished in 1979 to make room for the current Andrews Public Library building. The Andrews Public Library joined the Nantahala Regional Library system in 1940.

Andrews was home to the Wilhide brothers, Robert M. and Wilfred W. Wilhide, born between 1920 and 1922. Both were born and raised in Andrews, attended flight school at Cherry Point, North Carolina, and enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps as pilots during World War II. In the space of several days, after inflicting severe losses upon the Japanese fleet, both brothers were lost and killed during missions near Okinawa. The Wilhide brothers were given a memorial in the Valleytown cemetery, and a monument at Veterans Memorial Park in Andrews, not far from their childhood home and birthplace.

In October 1920, the Peavine Railroad was completed between Andrews and Hayesville. It hauled mainly lumber and was dismantled in 1951. Passenger service between Asheville, Murphy, and Andrews ended in 1948.

=== Late 20th century to present ===

The town’s first hospital was located downtown on the corner of Locust and Main Streets, founded by Dr. Van Gorder. In 1956, a 30-bed non-profit regional hospital named the District Memorial Hospital of Southwestern North Carolina was constructed in Andrews at a cost of $375,000 (about $4.3 Million today). A complete renovation and expansion was done in 1970, making it a 64-bed facility. Citing uncollected payments, District Memorial declared bankruptcy in 2000, closed in June 2003, and was demolished in late 2008/early 2009. Today the town is served by Erlanger Western Carolina Hospital southwest in Peachtree.
Industrial Opportunities, Inc. (IOI) was founded in 1974 to serve Cherokee, Clay, and Graham counties. The Andrews nonprofit hires mentally and physically disabled adults to manufacture military, medical, and commercial goods. IOI opened as a 1,200 square foot factory in Marble, North Carolina, and had operated in Marble until early 2003. IOI Road in Marble is the only piece left of IOI in Marble. The current factory was once home to the H.D. Lee company (now just Lee) that opened in 1979 and had been in Andrews for several years until its closure on January 11, 2002. IOI opened its Andrews location on February 28, 2003. It was also home to Berkshire Corporation until its closure in 1977. Andrews had two more industries during the late 20th century: Baker Furniture and Owenby Manufacturing. Baker Furniture&#x27;s Andrews plant opened in 1965 as Andrews Furniture Industries, Inc. The plant also made Magnavox stereos and TV cabinets. The plant closed on July 1, 2000. Owenby Manufacturing opened in 1955, and its closure date is unknown.
In 1976, the West End Plaza shopping center opened on the west side of town on Main Street. A second shopping center, named the Andrews Town Centre, opened in 1990. A four-lane highway was built between Andrews and Murphy around 1977. This new highway was opened in 1979, with its previous alignment through town becoming US 19 Business. A 10-mile, 12-inch water line was built to connect Andrews and Murphy&#x27;s water systems in 1999. The interconnect agreement expired in 2022. Andrews did not charge churches for city water until 1999. Andrews&#x27; city limits expanded in June 2000. In 2018-2019, the town hosted the last Possum Drop in North Carolina. In late 2024, Andrews&#x27; leaders unanimously repealed a law that banned weapons on town property, including the pool, library, and police department.

==Geography==
Andrews is located in northeastern Cherokee County on the south side of the Valley River, a southwestward-flowing tributary of the Hiwassee River and part of the Tennessee River watershed.

U.S. Routes 19, 74, and U.S. Route 129 form a four-lane bypass around the northern edge of the town; the highways lead northeast to Topton, where they diverge, and southwest to Murphy, the county seat. Bryson City is northeast via US 19/74, and Robbinsville is north via US 129.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Andrews has a total area of , all land.

Valleytown Township dominates the eastern part of Cherokee County. The area is bordered by Graham County to the north, Clay County to the south, and Macon County to the east. Within the township are the towns of Marble in the west, Andrews at the center, and Topton in the far east at the Macon and Graham county lines.

===Climate===
==Demographics==
Andrews&#x27; homeless population was 12 as of 2025.

===2020 census===
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 1,667 people, 714 households, and 400 families residing in the town.

===2010 census===
In the 2010 census, the total population was 1,781 people residing in 780 households including 452 family units. The population density was 1,090 people per square mile.

==Transportation==
The Western Carolina Regional Airport is a county-owned public-use airport located west of the central business district of Andrews.

Andrews was served by railroad from 1891 until the 1980s when Norfolk Southern decided to close the Murphy Branch west of Sylva, North Carolina, because of declining freight traffic. The Great Smoky Mountains Railroad operated passenger excursions from Dillsboro, North Carolina to Andrews from 1988 until 2010.

==Law enforcement==

The Andrews Police Department occupies a 1940s stone building that was also the town hall until the city administration moved to a building on West End Plaza in 2023.

In 2014, four officers walked out after an uncertified administrative police chief was hired. The town&#x27;s police department again faced turmoil in the early 2020s, according to the &quot;Cherokee Scout&quot; newspaper, as it went through eight police chiefs in six years and the town became known as a &quot;chief killer.&quot; In March 2014, four officers resigned in protest. In 2020, the police chief resigned after the mayor ordered him to establish checkpoints and harass visitors to prevent COVID-19 from entering Andrews. In 2021, an officer wrecked a patrol car at a high speed downtown. Afterwards, officers contemplated disabling their automatic vehicle locators so they couldn&#x27;t be tracked. That same year the city&#x27;s entire police force was suspended after officers reportedly moved cameras facing locations like the station&#x27;s evidence room. In May 2023, the assistant chief was wounded after he was accidentally shot with an AR-15 style rifle. In June 2023, a female officer who allegedly stalked a 16-year-old Andrews High School student she dated was ordered to stay away from the girl. In September 2023, the police chief was suspended after he was charged with obtaining property under false pretenses and obstruction of justice. He died before arrest.

==Education==

The town of Andrews has three schools. Andrews Elementary, Andrews Middle, and Andrews High School are part of the Cherokee County School System.

Until the early 1960s, all Andrews schools were located next to each other on the property of the current elementary school. A 1935 topographic map of Andrews shows each school building, marked with a flag, located adjacent to each other on Walnut Street (now Jean Christy Avenue) and Fourth Street. The current high school and current elementary school appears first in the 1975 map. Between 1935 and 1975, the school zone has dramatically changed.
Andrews Elementary (AES) is a Pre-K thru Grade 5 school. The current school building was constructed in 1951 as the Andrews Primary School. The building has had two expansions. In 1975, new classrooms, a cafeteria, a school library, and a separate building (for Pre-K) were added. This first expansion happened after the Andrews Grammar School, which was located just to the right of the small primary school building, was burned. After 1975, the school was Andrews Elementary. The school&#x27;s second and most recent expansion occurred in 2003, with the addition of a gymnasium connected to the building on the west side of the building. The old rock gym built in 1934 east of the school closed in May 1999 due to safety concerns and was demolished that December. With this expansion, Jean Christy Avenue was cut off and is now only a loop in the front of the school, and a road leading up to a turn onto Fourth Street behind the school.

Andrews High School (AHS) is a 9 thru 12 school built in 1963, after a fire burned down the second campus built in 1914. It was incorporated by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1893. The school most likely opened in 1890, after the establishment of the town&#x27;s name. From 1963 to 1999, Andrews High held students of Junior and Senior High.

In 1998, a new campus built between Wakefield Road and US-19 Business was constructed. The 25-acres of land that this campus was built on was donated by the H.D. Lee factory (now the Industrial Opportunities, Inc. factory) west of the site. This site was the home of the new, $4.89 million Andrews Middle School, established and opened on August 9, 1999. Junior High was turned to Middle School, and AES and AHS operated as a Pk–5 and a 9–12 school.

Andrews Elementary, Junior, and Senior High School were part of the Andrews City School District. Each city school district (Andrews and Murphy) had their own board of education and superintendent. Each district was in charge of many purchases for their schools, such as school transportation. Andrews was the first in Cherokee County to receive a school bus in 1926 and the first to receive an activity bus in 1951. The individual districts merged with Cherokee County Schools in 1969.

=== Andrews City Schools Superintendents ===

# Isham Barney Hudson (1935–1951)
# Charles O. Frazier (c.1962–1969)

After the merger of Andrews and Murphy&#x27;s districts in 1969, Cherokee County&#x27;s superintendent was John Jordan.

==Media==
Andrews was served by the weekly &quot;Andrews Journal&quot; newspaper from 1959 until January 1, 2019, when it merged with the &quot;Cherokee Scout&quot; in Murphy. Andrews no longer has a newspaper of its own. After the town&#x27;s newspaper closed, Mayor James Reid began offering a quarterly e-newsletter.

<text>Murphy is a town in and the county seat of Cherokee County, North Carolina, United States. It is situated at the confluence of the Hiwassee and Valley rivers. It is the westernmost county seat in the state of North Carolina, approximately from the state capital in Raleigh. The population of Murphy was 1,608 at the 2020 census.

==Etymology and history==
This area had long been part of the homelands of the Cherokee people. They knew this site along the Hiwassee River as &quot;Tlanusi-yi&quot; (the Leech Place). They had a legend about a giant leech named &quot;Tlanusi&quot;, that lived in the river here. The Trading Path (later called the &quot;Unicoi Turnpike&quot;) passed by the future site of Murphy, connecting the Cherokee lands east of the mountains with what were known to European colonists as the &quot;Overhill Towns&quot; of Tennessee.

After European Americans began to settle here, they named the site &quot;Hunnington/ Huntington&quot; after A.R.S. Hunter. He established the first trading post prior to 1828, where he would trade with the Cherokee, early European-American settlers, and U.S. Army soldiers on expeditions, or stationed at nearby Fort Butler. He was also appointed as the settlement&#x27;s first postmaster, erecting the first Post Office in June 1839.
European Americans later renamed the settlement as Murphy for North Carolina politician Archibald Murphey. He was influential in educational advances for the people of North Carolina in the early 19th century. The original spelling of the town was to be &quot;Murphey&quot; but a clerk or stenographer of the North Carolina General Assembly misspelled the name and “Murphy” stuck.

In 1836, during the Cherokee removal known as the Trail of Tears, the United States army built Fort Butler in what is today Murphy. Fort Butler was used as the main collection point by the government for Cherokee east of the mountains. From Fort Butler, the Cherokee were taken over the mountains on the Unicoi Turnpike to the main internment camps at Fort Cass (today Charleston, Tennessee), prior to their forcible removal to territory west of the Mississippi River, in what became known as Indian Territory (today&#x27;s Oklahoma).

Today, the Unicoi Turnpike is known as the Joe Brown Highway. There are no visible remains of Fort Butler, but the site can be visited and historical markers provide facts and interpretation about its history. In addition, the Cherokee County Historical Museum, located in Murphy, provides information about the Trail of Tears.

A 400-acre tract was surveyed for the town of Murphy in 1837. Cherokee County was formed in 1839 from a portion of Macon County, but Murphy was not incorporated as the county seat until 1851. Harshaw Chapel, the oldest surviving building in Murphy, was constructed in 1869.

In 1888, the railroad reached Murphy, with Georgia and North Carolina Railroad&#x27;s narrow gauge line built from Marietta, Georgia. In 1891, Southern Railway connected Murphy to Asheville via the Murphy Branch. The L&amp;N line from Georgia was removed in the mid-1980s. The Great Smoky Mountains Railroad ran excursions to Murphy on the Murphy Branch between 1988 and 1995. Today the track and right-of-way are still in place, owned by the North Carolina Department of Transportation, but the line is inoperable. The L&amp;N Depot, built southwest of downtown Murphy in 1901, has been refurbished as a community center.

===20th century to present===

Murphy began getting paved streets in 1917. The first paved road from Murphy to Georgia opened five years later. A highway from Murphy to Asheville opened in 1926.

Architect James Baldwin designed the Cherokee County Courthouse, located in downtown Murphy, in a Beaux-Arts style. Built in 1927, it is faced with locally sourced blue marble. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, along with Harshaw Chapel and the Robert Lafayette Cooper House. The county has had multiple prior courthouses; all burned down, or were replaced by improved versions. The first court sessions in the county were held at Fort Butler.

A two-story Carnegie Library was constructed on Peachtree Street downtown in 1919. The building later housed the town police department until 2024 and has been occupied by the Cherokee County Historical Museum since its start in 1977. The Nantahala Regional Library, headquartered in Murphy, is the oldest regional library in the state and one of the first regional libraries formed in the United States. It was organized May 1, 1937, and has locations in Cherokee, Clay, and Graham counties. The current headquarters for the Murphy Public Library and the Nantahala Regional Library opened downtown on May 16, 1976. The building was renovated in 2001.

Murphy was the home of the once well-known crafts manufacturer Margaret Studios. This company operated a nationwide chain of gift stores for its woodcraft products and housewares, such as lazy Susans and gift trays.

Murphy High School was constructed in 1925. A new campus was built to replace the high school in 1957. Murphy gained a public swimming pool in 1931. The pool, which was run by the Lions Club, closed in 1997 and a new pool opened around 2006 as part of the Hiwassee Valley Pool &amp; Wellness Center. The new pool was permanently enclosed in 2022.

Folklorist John Jacob Niles based his well-known Christmas song, &quot;I Wonder as I Wander&quot;, on a phrase he heard on July 16, 1933, in a song sung by a daughter of traveling evangelists in downtown Murphy. In 1945, Paul Westmoreland wrote his song “Detour (There&#x27;s a Muddy Road Ahead)&quot; while traveling to Murphy. He debuted the song in the neighboring town of Hayesville.

Murphy&#x27;s first medical institution was Petrie Hospital, founded in November 1933 by Dr. R.W. Petrie, an eye, ear, nose, and throat specialist. The hospital was a two-story white brick building atop a hill on Peachtree Street downtown. The Sisters of Providence of Holyoke came to Murphy in 1956 to manage Petrie Hospital and renamed it Providence Hospital. The 22-bed Murphy General Hospital was built by Dr. F. V. Taylor in 1941 and closed in July 1969 due to insufficient staff and property. In January 1974 the Murphy Town Council approved spending $4,000 on a study to see whether constructing a new hospital was feasible. Following this study, Providence Hospital closed in 1978, and Murphy Medical Center was founded in nearby Peachtree in 1979.

A new Murphy post office was constructed on Hiwassee Street in 1949, replacing the former location on Tennessee Street. In approximately 1961, the two-mile, four lane Dr. William A. Hoover Bridge was built over the Hiwassee River near Murphy to serve US Route 19. Levi Strauss &amp; Co. opened a plant in Murphy in December 1963 to make jeans. The plant hired 380 employees at its peak. It closed in February 1999. Today, the building is occupied by Snap-on Tools.

On April 3, 1974, an F4 tornado in Murphy killed four people (including two children) and injured 40. It destroyed 45 houses, 45 mobile homes, and caused major damage to 55 other homes. Local damages totaled $13 million (1974). It was the deadliest of four tornadoes that hit the county during the first four days of April in the 1974 Super Outbreak. An EF2 tornado hit Murphy on March 2, 2012, as part of the Tornado outbreak of March 2–3, 2012. This tornado damaged two schools and affected multiple businesses.

Nearly a year after the March 2012 tornado, debris washed up in the Valley River under the Bulldog Drive bridge and caused the waters to go to the sides, causing strong currents, making a large portion of the bridge collapse. A water system was also damaged and left many businesses east of the bridge without sewer or water. The nearby Murphy High School was without both, with students having to use port-a-potties and carry bagged lunches made at another school.

A four-lane highway was built between Murphy and the neighboring town of Andrews around 1977. Walmart&#x27;s first North Carolina store was constructed in Murphy in 1983 and opened on August 16. The store moved to its current location in 1991 and the old building is now a Big Lots, Mexican store, and Mexican restaurant. Murphy&#x27;s Walmart remained the only one in the state until 1986. In 1999, a 10-mile, 12-inch water line was built to connect Murphy and Andrews&#x27; water systems. The interconnect agreement expired in 2022. 

On May 31, 2003 Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph was captured behind a Murphy Save-A-Lot by rookie police officer Jeff Postell. In October 2024, one of the oldest remaining buildings in downtown Murphy, the Akin-Axley-Davidson house at 69 Valley River Avenue, was demolished. The home was built during the Civil War.

On February 21, 2025, it was announced that construction of a new roundabout in the town of Murphy, on the intersections of Peachtree Street, Valley River Avenue, Tennessee Street, and Hiwassee Street would begin that following Monday (February 24). A roundabout was previously at the intersection, known as Bull Moose Pen, until August 1952. The original roundabout contained a fountain in the middle of the entire intersection. The fountain, currently at the Cherokee County Historical Museum, is set to return to the new roundabout. The project also includes the reconfiguration of the four roads, changing them from four lanes, to three (including a center turn lane).

<text>Edenton is a town in, and the county seat of, Chowan County, North Carolina, United States, on Albemarle Sound. The population was 4,397 at the 2020 census. Edenton is located in North Carolina&#x27;s Inner Banks region. In recent years Edenton has become a popular retirement location and a destination for heritage tourism.

Edenton served as the second official capital of North Carolina, during the colonial era as the Province of North Carolina, though other than housing the governor&#x27;s official residence, it did not otherwise house any other governmental functions. It served as capital from 1722 to 1743, when it was moved to Brunswick. The town was the site of the Edenton Tea Party, a protest organized by several Edenton women in 1774 in solidarity with the organizers of the Boston Tea Party. It was the birthplace of Harriet Jacobs, an enslaved African American whose 1861 autobiography, &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot;, is now considered an American classic. Edenton gained notoriety for a famous wrongful conviction during the Satanic panic era of the late twentieth century. Today, Edenton&#x27;s local economy is primarily driven by tourism, and as a popular retirement location.

==History==
===Edenton Colony===
In 1658 adventurers from the Jamestown area drifted through the wilderness from Virginia and found a location on the northern shore of a small natural harbor at , now called Edenton Bay. Edenton Colony was the first permanent European settlement in what is now the state of North Carolina.

Edenton was established in 1712 as &quot;the Towne on Queen Anne&#x27;s Creek&quot;. It was later known as &quot;Ye Towne on Mattercommack Creek&quot; and still later as &quot;the Port of Roanoke&quot;. It was renamed &quot;Edenton&quot; and incorporated in 1722 in honor of Governor Charles Eden, who had died that year.

===Historic Edenton===
Edenton served as the second capital of the Province of North Carolina, from 1722 to 1743, with the governor establishing his residence there and the population increasing during that period.

William Byrd II, who visited the town in March 1729, provides a description of Edenton in his &quot;The History of the Dividing Line&quot;:
This town is Situated on the north side of Albermarle Sound which is there about 5 miles over. A Dirty Slash runs all along the Back of it, which in the Summer is a foul annoyance, and furnishes abundance of that Carolina plague, musquetas. There may be 40 or 50 Houses, most of them Small, built without Expense. A Citizen here is counted Extravagant, if he has Ambition enough to aspire to a Brick-chimney. Justice herself is but indifferently Lodged, the Court-House having much the Air of a Common Tobacco-House. I believe this is the only metropolis in the Christian or Mohametan world where there is neither Church, Chapel, Mosque, Synagogue, nor any other Place of Publick Worship of any Sect or Religion whatsoever. What little Devotion there may be is much more private than their vices. 

A landmark in women&#x27;s history occurred in Edenton in 1774. Fifty-one women in Edenton, led by Penelope Barker, signed a protest petition agreeing to boycott English tea and other products, in what became known, decades later, as the Edenton Tea Party. The Edenton Tea Party is the first known political action by women in the British American colonies. In fact it so shocked London that newspapers published etchings depicting the women as uncontrollable. Her home, the Barker House, is open seven days a week, without a fee, and is considered by many as Edenton&#x27;s living room.

Joseph Hewes, a resident of Edenton and successful owner of a merchant marine fleet, was appointed the first Secretary of the Navy in 1776. John Adams said that Hewes &quot;laid the foundation, the cornerstone of the American Navy.&quot; Hewes also signed the United States Declaration of Independence.

James Iredell, also of Edenton, was at 38 the youngest member of the first United States Supreme Court. He was appointed by George Washington. His son James Iredell Jr., served as the Democratic-Republican governor of North Carolina and then became a United States senator. His home may be toured through the Historic Edenton Visitors Center.

Easy sea access halted with a 1795 hurricane which silted Roanoke Inlet. Completion of the 1805 Dismal Swamp Canal took business elsewhere by diverting shipping to Norfolk, Virginia. Locals rejected construction of a railroad, a lack that impeded the local economy.

Supreme Court Justice James Wilson, a signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution, died in Edenton on August 21, 1798, at age 55, while riding his judicial circuit.
Harriet Jacobs and her brother John were born into slavery in Edenton in 1813 and 1815, respectively. They, and later Harriet&#x27;s children, were baptized at St.Paul&#x27;s. Their early childhood was centered around Horniblow&#x27;s tavern, the town&#x27;s only colonial hotel, on the northern side of East King Street, just west of Chowan County Courthouse. Twelve-year old John Jacobs was sold at public auction in 1828, probably at Market House (junction Water Street / Broad Street). Both siblings became enslaved to an abusive master, the local physician, Dr. James Norcom, living with him at his house on West Eden Street. In 1835, Harriet Jacobs went into hiding in the house of her grandmother, a freedwoman, on the northern side of West King Street, a few steps from Broad Street. She famously had to stay there concealed in a crawl space for seven years before she was finally able to escape to New York, where she wrote &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot;, now considered an &quot;American classic&quot;.

In 1862, during the Civil War, the Albemarle Artillery was recruited at Edenton by a local attorney named William Badham Jr. Its guns were cast from bronze bells taken from courthouse and churches in the Edenton area. Known as the Edenton Bell Battery, its four howitzers were named the &quot;Columbia&quot;, &quot;St. Paul&quot;, &quot;Fannie Roulac&quot;, and &quot;Edenton&quot;. Two of the guns, the &quot;St. Paul&quot; and &quot;Edenton&quot;, have been returned to Edenton and can now be seen at Edenton&#x27;s waterfront park.

Edenton enjoyed an economic revival beginning in 1890 led by lumbering, an 1898 cotton mill, and a 1909 peanut-processing plant. The J. H. Leary building, constructed in 1894, was owned by Josephine Leary, an African American real estate entrepreneur.

Edenton is the home of the 1886 Roanoke River Lighthouse. The lighthouse is called a screw-pile design because of its original support system. Each piling was literally screwed into the river or sound bottom so they would not pull out in heavy storms and hurricanes. The Roanoke River Lighthouse, now located at Edenton, is believed to be the last extant example in the United States of a rectangular frame building built for a screw-pile base. The lighthouse was in commission from 1887 until 1941.

Edenton is home to numerous early houses and public buildings, including the Cupola House. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970, a designation also accorded the 1776 Chowan County Courthouse. The courthouse is still used for official court events. The city is home to the oldest house still in existence in North Carolina, constructed in 1719 before the establishment of the city.

Edenton achieved international notoriety for the Little Rascals Day Care sexual abuse case, the subject of journalist Ofra Bikel&#x27;s award-winning trilogy of Frontline documentaries: &quot;Innocence Lost&quot; (1991), &quot;Innocence Lost: The Verdict&quot; (1993), and &quot;Innocence Lost: The Plea&quot; (1997).

==Geography==
Edenton is located in southern Chowan County sits at the north end of Edenton Bay, just north of the confluence of the Chowan and Roanoke rivers, which forms Albemarle Sound.

U.S. Route 17, a four-lane expressway, runs along the northern border of the town, with access from five exits. US 17 leads northeast to Elizabeth City and southwest to Williamston. Nags Head on the Outer Banks is to the east by road, and Raleigh, the state capital, is to the west.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Edenton has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.55%, is water.
