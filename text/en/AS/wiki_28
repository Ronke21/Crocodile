<text>Wimbledon is a city in Pierce Township, Barnes County, North Dakota, United States. The population was 178 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Wimbledon is located at (47.170662, -98.459941).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The city is in the south-west corner of the township, adjacent to the border with Stutsman County. (In North Dakota, the term &quot;township&quot; refers to a six-mile square unit of territory, not to a particular settlement.)

No major highways pass through or near Wimbledon, which is just off State Route 9 from Melville to Rogers.

The nearest large settlement (by North Dakota standards) is Jamestown to the south-west, followed by Valley City to the south-east, which is the county seat.

==History==
===Foundation===
Wimbledon was founded in 1892. It was named for Wimbledon, London, which featured in the ancestry of John Henry Gibson, who homesteaded the land the town was built on.

Gibson was born in 1844 of farming stock at East Wallingford, Vermont, but &quot;went West&quot; as a young man and obtained title to 149 acres (60 hectares) of the local prairie in 1889. He registered this under the Homestead Act 1862, indicating that he settled around 1882. Fortuitously, he did so when the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad (always nicknamed the &quot;Soo Line&quot;) was surveying a railroad on a bee-line diagonally across the future state from Mantador to Portal to be part of a trunk route from Minneapolis to Vancouver, British Columbia. The survey line crossed his property, but initially the nearest town was pencilled in to be two miles south-east, and was to be called &quot;Hilltown&quot;. However, he offered land to the railroad at a good price and so, in late 1892, Wimbledon was platted and a post office established in 1893. Gibson&#x27;s farmstead (previously named &quot;Gibson&quot; after him) had already been a mail-drop beforehand, with his being entrusted to hand on mail to his neighbors -and this would have influenced matters.

Wimbledon was a railroad town, and proof of this is in the layout. Instead of the original platting grid conforming to the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), as most of the state of North Dakota does, it aligned to the railroad. Initially it was seven blocks wide and six deep, but only three of the latter &quot;took&quot; -and the horizontal streets were not given numbers, but descriptions: &quot;Railway&quot;, &quot;Center&quot;, and &quot;Out&quot;. As the town grew, its additions conformed to the PLSS, including areas originally part of the undeveloped back three strips.

===Youth===
The first of many grain elevators, for which the town was to be famous, was set up in the year of its foundation. There were to be eight by 1908.

The nascent town prospered, and obtained three indicators of civic status before the century was out. In 1894 the &quot;Hotel Kline&quot; was founded by Frank Kline, who dealt in railroad-shipped lumber at a time when the countryside hereabouts completely lacked trees. This was important for the future, as it meant commercial travelers and business folk could visit without being gourmandized by bed-bugs in a flophouse. Then, in the same year, the &quot;Wimbledon News&quot; newspaper was founded. Also, the first public school was set up -although it had to wait till 1906 for proper premises to be provided.

Water supply was a problem in summer, but the town is on an artesian basin. So, the railroad sank a well when the town was founded -but in winter the water pressure was uncontrollable, and the well was finally dynamited in 1916 to stop it flooding the town. The water was saline and unsuitable for drinking or locomotive boilers, anyway. However, it was good for peace of mind -because it enabled an effective fire-fighting department to be set up in 1893 (the early town buildings were all wooden, and fire was capable of burning a whole block out or worse).

The settlement was officially incorporated as a legal &quot;village&quot; in 1899. In North Dakota before 1967, incorporated settlements were either villages or cities (in that year, they all became cities). So, this amounted to Wimbledon becoming a town in the generally accepted sense of the term.

===Maturity===
Indications of the town&#x27;s coming of age in the new century were the acquisition of a bank (it had two for a time), a horse racing venue and a public cemetery.

The &quot;First National Bank of Wimbledon&quot; was chartered in 1903, and issued ten and twenty dollar bills. It built a two-storey brick edifice on Third and Center (122 3rd Avenue), but in 1913 faced competition when the &quot;Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank of Wimbledon&quot; was founded. The latter was to serve the town for almost eighty years, taking over the First National&#x27;s building after its rival went bankrupt in 1925. It is now (2020) a branch of &quot;Bank Forward&quot;, but the old edifice has been abandoned and replaced with a single-storey layout on the opposite corner.

Victory Park, to the north-east of the town, became a horse racing venue in 1906 when the &quot;Wimbledon Fair and Racing Association&quot; was organized and a half-mile track was constructed with a proper grandstand. It lasted over half a century, but is now the town recreation ground.

The Prairie View Cemetery was founded in 1910, and is still in use. It is on 17th Street SE, quite a way east of town (the name is apt).

The town reached peak population of 571 in the 1910 census. In 1920 it was 521, and this was an indication that the first generation of homesteaders was already making way for commercial growers of grain, who were beginning to combine farms in order to enjoy economies of scale.

In 1908, the town had the following businesses and services: Four churches (three survive), a school, two banks, a post office, two hotels, two restaurants, two billiard halls, a newspaper, a telephone exchange (opened 1904), a realtor, two physicians, a dentist, a veterinary, two music instructors, two barbershops, four general stores, two butchers, a bakers, a confectioners, a drugstore, a clothes shop, a jewelers, a furniture store, two hardware stores, a harness shop, two blacksmiths (ironworkers), two &quot;tin shops&quot; (non-ferrous metalworkers), two implement shops, two livery stables (horse and mule hire places), a dray line (cart hire -no motor taxis or auto hire yet), a feed supplier (ancestor of the filling station), a printer, two painters, a builder and a stonemason. Attorneys were notable by their absence (they would have been around the courthouse in Valley City, but one did hang out his shingle here by 1920) and saloons were obviously not being listed. Not all the folks who ran these establishments would have been fully professional at the time, as many of them would have been homesteading as well.

In 1914, the village board granted an ordnance to the &quot;Wimbledon Electric Company&quot; to wire up the town. The company generated its own power.

===Midland Continental Railroad===
Before 1913, Wimbledon was just one of a string of small towns along the Soo Line railroad, with Leal to the south-east and Courtenay to the north-west. It depended entirely on this railroad for links with the outside world, as there was no state highway system back then.

In 1908, the Midland Continental Railroad (MICO) began construction of a trunk line from Winnipeg to Galveston, Texas passing through Courtenay, Jamestown and Edgeley. It built Edgeley to Jamestown but then, fortunately for Wimbledon, ran out of money for a bridge over the Northern Pacific Railway transcontinental line at the latter place. It was forced to build east to a point where it could burrow cheaply through a fill carrying the main line, and then head north to Wimbledon instead of Courteney.

The new railroad was finished in October 1913, apart from a very short extension of 0.3 miles (0.5 km) to a location called &quot;Frazier&quot; north of the Wimbledon passenger station and in open country. This was finished in December. The Wimbledon station was then to the east of downtown, on 17th Street SE.

Frazier on 16 1/2 Avenue SE was the site of an abortive rival town project sponsored by the North Dakota Nonpartisan League, and was named after a prominent member Lynn Frazier (later state governor). The MICO&#x27;s intention was to go on to Grand Forks, which was dropped when the USA entered the First World War in 1917. That was the end of Frazier as a town. Instead, it became the location of an important set of grain elevators run by the &quot;Frazier Farmers Union Co-op&quot;, opened in 1917.

The MICO made Wimbledon, in effect, a four-railroad town because, as well as handling its own traffic, it functioned as a terminal road for the &quot;Northern Pacific&quot; and also for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad at Edgeley. So, the town gained access to two transcontinental lines and this gave it an edge over its neighbors.

===Inter-war===
In 1920 the MICO railroad moved its Wimbledon passenger station downtown from its former location on the city&#x27;s eastern outskirts, on 17th Street SE. A site was chosen on the corner of Railway Street and 4th Avenue, opposite the Soo main line station, and a short spur built to it from the western junction curve to the Soo Line. The station building was jacked up off its poured concrete foundation and put on rollers for its journey down Railway Street.

The local farmers then were growing wheat and oats in about equal quantities, with alfalfa for feed hay a smaller third. Other crops were rye, potatoes and linseed. Livestock and dairy farming did feature, as a reminder of the original self-sufficient mixed farming ideal of the homestead. A co-operative creamery was opened in 1929, and this also wholesaled the locally reared turkeys.

The creation of the North Dakota State Highway System in 1926 put Wimbledon on the wrong side of its railroads tracks from Route 9, but marked the end of the town&#x27;s complete dependence on its two railroads.

In that year the MICO ran one train each way to Jamestown but with only a twenty-minute layover, so folk could not go on a day-trip to that city. The Soo Line had two trains each way between Minneapolis and Portal, one slow and one semi-fast. The semi-fast left Wimbledon at 8:10 AM to arrive at Minneapolis at 5:45 PM, the same time as the return train left that city to arrive back at Wimbledon at 9:39 PM. These trains allowed for a full day in the county seat of Valley City, from 9:05 AM to 8:45 PM.

In 1937, the MICO railroad received permission to discontinue timetabled freight and passenger services from Jamestown to Wimbledon and to operate on &quot;call and demand&quot;, meaning that carload freight customers would contact MICO Control at Jamestown to arrange pickup and delivery. Passenger service continued, but &quot;on an irregular basis&quot; and would have involved a so-called &quot;mixed train&quot; consisting of a passenger car attached to a rake of freight cars. The former would have been used for LCL (&quot;less than-car-load&quot;) freight items as well. The last paying passenger was recorded as travelling in 1965.

===Later 20th century===
In 1948, the village board decided to open an airport, and purchased land to the south-west for a single grass runway. The &quot;Wimbledon Municipal Airport&quot; ended up having six small hangars in total, and was especially useful as a base for crop-spraying aircraft. However, it became a private airfield between 1965 and 1983 and ceased operations between 2001 and 2003. The terminal area including the hangars, on Route 9, was annexed to the city territory despite being in Stutsman County.

In 1950, the town was made a city. It was still three-quarters the size of what it had been at its peak in 1910 -population 449 compared to 571. The local farmers had taken to growing barley, which was the second crop after wheat -pushing oats into third place.

In 1957, the &quot;Wimbledon News&quot; newspaper ceased publication.

In 1968, the city had: Three churches, a school, a bank, a post office, a hotel, a restaurant, two insurance brokers, two meeting places (the &quot;American Legion Hall&quot; and the &quot;Wimbledon Community Building&quot;), a barbershop, a laundromat, two general stores (one called &quot;Jack&#x27;s Red Owl&quot;), a hardware store (called &quot;Cherney&#x27;s Hardware&quot;), two implement shops, a blacksmith, two oil company outlets, a filling station, a lumber yard, two truck lines, a builder, a home service company and a crop sprayer (based at the airport).

The NICO railroad closed down in 1969, after serious flood damage in the spring of that year. Formal abandonment took place in 1970, and the tracks were mostly torn up. However a stub from Frazier to Clementsville was kept on by the Soo Line to service grain elevators, and this survived until 1982.

The NICO Wimbledon station building was donated to the &quot;Wimbledon Community Museum&quot;, which kept it on a care-and-maintenance basis for the next forty years.

The American passenger railroad business had been failing for two decades, and in response the federal government created Amtrak in 1971 and relieved railroad companies of the responsibility of running passenger trains. This was the end of the passenger train station at Wimbledon, and so of any public transport links since the city had no scheduled bus service.

===Recent times===
The city population has been falling gently but steadily over the last few decades, at about thirty a decade. By 2018, it was down to an estimated 192 -which was a third of the peak in 1910. However this compares well with neighboring settlements which have either ghosted, or are heading that way. Of its near neighbors on the Soo Line railroad, Leal has twenty inhabitants, and Courtenay has forty-seven. On the MICO railroad, &quot;Durupt&quot; is now a plowed field -this was an older settlement than Wimbledon, and the latter&#x27;s first Catholic church used to be here before being moved.

The economics of scale in farming continue to be applied in North Dakota, and since 2007 farm size has gone up 20% with a consequent loss of population. On the enlarged farms locally, soybeans had displaced wheat as the number one crop with corn in third place.

In 2012, the old MICO train station was refurbished and opened as the &quot;Midland Continental Depot Transportation Museum&quot;, featuring the life of Peggy Lee as well as the railroad.

In 2014, the school closed as the result of a merger, and concentration on a more central site for the north part of the county. In 2015, the John Deere agricultural machinery dealership also shut.

As with most small American towns outside touristy areas, running an independent retail or service business here became very economically challenging towards the end of the 20th century. In response to the threat of losing its last general store after the closure of &quot;John Deere&quot;, locals set up the &quot;Wimbledon Community Store and Café&quot; as a non-profit organization relying in part on volunteers to run it.

The community has also erected a &quot;Veterans&#x27; Memorial&quot;, completed in 2017.

In 2020, the city had: Three churches, a bank, a post office, a general store with small restaurant and kitchenette for rental, a bar, two insurance brokers, a sleep consultant, a child care center, two farm suppliers (one a co-op with a retail outlet and diner), a car wash and two campsites. The &quot;Wimbledon Newsletter&quot; is published monthly.

==Topography==
===The plat===
North Dakota has a distinctive checkerboard landscape, owing to its conforming to the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) as it was developed by settlers. Hence, the property boundaries and roads are usually longitudinal (north-south) and latitudinal (east-west). Longitudinal roads are called &quot;avenues&quot;, and latitudinal ones &quot;streets&quot;. These are identified by number, often with a compass bearing. Hence State Route 9, which is Wimbledon&#x27;s access to the outside world, enters the city from the west as 17th Street SE, parallels the railroad diagonally for a short distance (the railroad was there first) and leaves to the south as 97th Avenue SE.

However, Wimbledon is a railroad town and was developed by a company affiliated to the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad which built its trunk line diagonally across the state. As a result, the original plat grid did not align to the PLSS, but with the railroad. Further, the nomenclature was non-standard. The streets were not given numbers, but descriptions: &quot;Railway&quot;, &quot;Center&quot;, and &quot;Out&quot;. The avenues were given numbers: 1st, 2nd, 2nd 1/2, 3rd, 3rd 1/2, 4th.

The railroad grade crossing was on 3rd Avenue, which hence became the city&#x27;s main drag and was provided with extra width. It was also extended beyond the original plat to the Roman Catholic church to the north-east, with its landmark spire.

When the town was expanded, it had two large additions laid out to the north and east. These were conformed to the PLSS, with the result that the roadway nomenclature is chaotic and confusing to strangers. For example, 1st Avenue turns to heads east disjunctively, 1st Avenue N (not the same) heads north -and is paralleled by 1st Street N. Gibson Street, on the west edge of the built up area, also heads north -and has no number, because it is west of 1st Avenue N.

A third, very small town expansion of three roadways was laid out at the south-west end of 3rd Avenue, after it crosses Route 9. This remains the only residential area south of the railroad tracks.

===What is here===
The railroad remains in business. Route 9 is to the south-west, on the wrong side of it, so the city&#x27;s &quot;Welcome&quot; sign is on the junction between it and 3rd Avenue and is surrounded by grain elevators and silos. The oldest of the former has a ghost sign reading &quot;Wimbledon Farmers Elevator Co&quot;. The farm supply arrangements here belong to &quot;Agroline Limited&quot; by the junction, and &quot;Arrowwood Prairie Co-op&quot; further south. The latter is the largest company based in Wimbledon, with its head office here and two sets of premises. Smaller farm requisites and consumables, as well as retail fuel and a diner, are with the office and farm machinery is further on south.

Crossing the railroad grade crossing on 3rd Avenue, the first street is &quot;Railway&quot;. On this to the right is the site of the original Soo Line passenger station, now occupied by a long shed. Opposite this on the east 4th Avenue corner is the old Midland Continental Railroad station, which is now the &quot;Midland Continental Depot Transportation Museum&quot;. Across 4th Avenue is a former hotel building, two storeys in red brick with decorative details in the brickwork.

Continuing down 3rd Avenue, some of the buildings facing the road are former retail premises with traditional false pediments for signage. The next junction, with &quot;Center&quot;, is the city hub. To the near left is the one-storey bank and post office, and facing it is the &quot;Wimbledon Community Store and Café&quot;. This has an interesting paint job, including an arboreal mural for its small tea-garden. On the far right is the former bank building, two storeys in brick and with identification plaques: &quot;First National Bank&quot; and &quot;1905&quot;. Slightly further on on 3rd is the town bar.

The rest of the city is mostly residential, of recent construction, although the three churches are outside the original plat. Notable is the number of trees -if farming ceased here, the land would revert to forest, not prairie. The pre-settlement prairie was treeless because of bison grazing pressure, not because of climate or soil quality -as was the case further west in the state.

3rd melds with 4th at St Boniface&#x27;s Catholic Church, and continues as 4th. The city&#x27;s water tower is just to the north of the church. Further on is the entrance drive to the &quot;City Park&quot;, which used to be the &quot;Victory Park&quot; horse racing track. The ghost of the actual track is still visible in the grass.

The &quot;Veterans&#x27; Memorial&quot; is the latest addition to the city&#x27;s facilities.

About 5.6% of families and 6.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.8% of those under the age of eighteen and 8.9% of those 65 or over.

==Churches==
===St Boniface Catholic Church===
The Roman Catholic church is at 504 3rd Avenue, the opposite end of that thoroughfare from the railroad crossing.

The first, wooden, church on this site was actually erected in 1886 at &quot;Durupt&quot; (now a ghost town), five miles south. The dedication to St Boniface, the Apostle to the Germans, indicates the German origins of the first worshipers. When they realised that Wimbledon was going to be more important, they jacked the church up, put it on rollers and used horse power to drag it to its new site just north of the town plat in 1895. This was chosen because it was the highest point hereabouts.

In 1907, a priest&#x27;s house was under construction. Something went badly wrong, the unfinished building caught fire and the church burned to the ground, too. A new one was erected in the following year. The architect was G. R. Clausen.

This is an impressive Gothic edifice in bright red brick with a few stone details, having a nave without aisles of five bays, a narrower sanctuary of one bay and a three-sided apse. The nave side walls each have five large pointed windows with two-light tracery, separated by buttresses each of which has two sloping steps in stone. The nave roof is steeply pitched, and the sanctuary and apse have separate pitches at a lower level.

The west front has a central tower, mostly set into the first bay of the nave and functioning also as the entrance porch. This tower has a landmark spire, flanked by the gabled tops of the four walls and four corner pinnacles which top corner buttresses. There are three storeys to the tower; the first has the single entrance, in the form of a pointed arch with step molding in brick and with a transom window fitted into the arch above the doorway. The second storey has a large Gothic window with tracery, and the third (the bell-chamber) has a large louvered aperture in each face. The top of the tower&#x27;s second storey and the sloping nave rooflines on each side are embellished with little floating arcades of Gothic arches in brick.

An unusual device tops the entrance portal, in the form of an acute-angled triangular gable which obscures the large tower window.

===St John&#x27;s United Methodist Church===
This church was originally founded in 1931 as a union of three worshipping communities, Presbyterian, German Reformed and Methodist, which got together to build a proper church edifice. They lacked the resources to do so otherwise. However, the original church has been demolished and replaced by a modern structure on the west side of the city, at 100 Center Street. This is in reinforced concrete with pink brick infill, and is a low rectangular edifice with a distinctive shallow triangular apse occupying its front end flanked by vertical window strips.

===St Paul&#x27;s Lutheran Church===
The Lutheran church is hidden away at 307 Gibson Street, away from downtown and set back from the street. It is a low, nondescript vernacular building with s steeply pitched roof and with no ecclesiastical features. This replaced a Gothic-style church with tower, which was built in 1909.

==Education==
Students in the Wimbledon area attend &quot;Barnes County North Public School&quot;, which is located two miles west of Leal. Around 300 students are enrolled in the &quot;Barnes County North School District&quot;. The district covers Courtenay, Dazey, Eckelson, Rogers, Sanborn, Spiritwood, Spiritwood Lake, Urbana, Walum (actually in Griggs County), and Wimbledon.

Prior to 2007, there were three separate school districts: &quot;North Central of Barnes&quot; north of Rogers (K-12), &quot;Wimbledon-Courtenay&quot; in Wimbledon (K-12), and &quot;Spiritwood&quot; in Spiritwood (K-6). In 2007, the three districts merged into the Barnes County North School District. From 2007 to 2012, the three schools (North Central Campus, Wimbledon-Courtenay Campus, and Spiritwood Campus) operated as they had before the merger. In 2013, the Spiritwood Campus was closed, and the North Central Campus housed preschool through fifth grade, while the Wimbledon-Courtenay Campus housed grades 6-12. In 2014, construction of the centralized facility was completed, and the remaining two facilities were closed, and all students in the district began attending the new Barnes County North Public School.

The call to build the monument went out in the April 15, 1920 issue of the &quot;Leeds News.&quot; The November 18, 1920 issue of the &quot;Leeds News&quot; listed the names of the men and women who were to be placed on the monument to ensure that no names had been missed. The August 4, 1921 issue of the &quot;Leeds News&quot; announced that on August 7, 1921 the monument would be given its official dedication at 3 o&#x27;clock by the Great Northern right of way near the depot. It was written that &quot;...this little spot has been seeded down and well cared for this summer and makes a pretty setting for the monument.&quot; The monument currently resides in Firemen&#x27;s Memorial Park.

The steel helmet and service coat of Leeds service member John A. Montgomery is currently located at the National WW1 Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri. Montgomery was assigned to the &quot;...9th Company, 2nd Motor Mechanics Regiment, 2nd Battalion Air Service Mechanics. The 2nd Battalion was attached to the French Tank Corps 4 May 1918 to 13 December 1918 and employed in the repair of French Renault and Schneider tanks.

<text>Medora (, ) is a city in Billings County, North Dakota, United States. The only incorporated place in Billings County, it is also the county seat. Much of the surrounding area is part of either Little Missouri National Grassland or Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The population was 121 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Dickinson Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Medora was founded in 1883 along the transcontinental rail line of the Northern Pacific Railway by French nobleman Marquis de Mores, who named the city after his wife Medora von Hoffman. Marquis de Mores wanted to ship refrigerated meat to Chicago via the railroad. He built a meat packing plant for this purpose and a house named the Chateau de Mores, which is now a museum.

In the evening of April 7, 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt, who had visited and invested in ranches in the area in the 1880s, visited Medora on a presidential tour of the Western United States. Most of the Badlands&#x27; residents turned out to greet him on his whistle stop. Roosevelt later recalled that &quot;the entire population of the Badlands down to the smallest baby had gathered to meet me… They all felt I was their man, their old friend; and even if they had been hostile to me in the old days when we were divided by the sinister bickering and jealousies and hatreds of all frontier communities, they now firmly believed they had always been my staunch friends and admirers. I shook hands with them all and…I only regretted that I could not spend three hours with them.&quot; A local hotel changed its name that same year to the Rough Riders Hotel. In 1962 the hotel was purchased by Harold Schafer. After the creation of the Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation in 1986, the hotel changed hands and is now operated by the Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation.

In April 2021, a wildfire threatened Medora and caused the town to evacuate during its tourist season. The fire burned 2,276 acres around Medora but spared the town.

<text>Antler is a city in Bottineau County in the U.S. state of North Dakota. The population was 22 at the 2020 census. Antler was founded in 1905.

==History==
Antler was established as a rural post office base in 1898. The developed town moved to its present location in 1902 to be closer to the Great Northern Railway to the south. The town was formally platted and founded in 1905, and reached a population of 342 by the 1910 Census. In 1911 Antler was the site of a system of tornadoes that killed ten people, making it the third deadliest tornado in North Dakota&#x27;s recorded history.

Antler&#x27;s population declined to 101 by the 1980 Census, and just 47 as of the 2000 census.

Antler High School closed in 1976. The Antler Grade School was set to close in 1981. Fearing the end of their town, Rick Jorgensen and Harley &quot;Bud&quot; Kissner thought of ways to bring in newcomers with school-age children to the town with the intent of keeping the school open. Rick thought of the idea to give away land and Bud volunteered some of his farm to modern homesteaders. The deal was to stay for five years and enroll the children in the Antler elementary school. Rick drew up a newspaper ad while a wire service spread the story. The story made national network news, airing twice on NBC evening edition, with the first story stating the reason was to increase the population and the second story about its role in reopening of the town&#x27;s schools by the land giveaway. Rick received letters from all over the world, including Germany and Australia. The plan worked for just a few years and the grade school closed in 1987, with 6 families receiving plots of 5 or .

==History==

Bottineau was founded in 1883 as Oak Creek as a customs station and an overnight stagecoach stop. The town name was changed to Bottineau in 1884 in honor of Pierre Bottineau a Métis pioneer, hunter, and trapper, who became a successful land speculator.

The town was originally located about 1½ miles (2½ km) north of its current location. The entire town was moved south in 1887 to where the Great Northern Railway was installing new tracks.

The widest tornado on record in North Dakota, at 1.14 miles wide, dropped near Bottineau in 1986. It destroyed a mobile home but did not harm the pregnant woman who was inside.

In 2012, a new chalet called Annie&#x27;s House was built in Bottineau Winter Park, north. The facility was North Dakota&#x27;s first ski facility for handicapped children and wounded veterans. It was built to honor Ann Nicole Nelson, who was the only North Dakotan to die in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City.

<text>The Cavendish Laboratory is the Department of Physics at the University of Cambridge, and is part of the School of Physical Sciences. The laboratory was opened in 1874 on the New Museums Site as a laboratory for experimental physics and is named after the British chemist and physicist Henry Cavendish. The laboratory has had a huge influence on research in the disciplines of physics and biology.

The laboratory moved to its present site in West Cambridge in 1974.

, 30 Cavendish researchers have won Nobel Prizes. Notable discoveries to have occurred at the Cavendish Laboratory include the discovery of the electron, neutron, and structure of DNA.

==Founding==


The Cavendish Laboratory was initially located on the New Museums Site, Free School Lane, in the centre of Cambridge. It is named after British chemist and physicist Henry Cavendish for contributions to science and his relative William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire, who served as chancellor of the university and donated funds for the construction of the laboratory.

Professor James Clerk Maxwell, the developer of electromagnetic theory, was a founder of the laboratory and the first Cavendish Professor of Physics. The Duke of Devonshire had given to Maxwell, as head of the laboratory, the manuscripts of Henry Cavendish&#x27;s unpublished &quot;Electrical Works&quot;. The editing and publishing of these was Maxwell&#x27;s main scientific work while he was at the laboratory. Cavendish&#x27;s work aroused Maxwell&#x27;s intense admiration and he decided to call the Laboratory (formerly known as the Devonshire Laboratory) the Cavendish Laboratory and thus to commemorate both the Duke and Henry Cavendish.

==Physics==
Several important early physics discoveries were made here, including the discovery of the electron by J.J. Thomson (1897) the Townsend discharge by John Sealy Townsend, and the development of the cloud chamber by C.T.R. Wilson.

Ernest Rutherford became Director of the Cavendish Laboratory in 1919. Under his leadership the neutron was discovered by James Chadwick in 1932, and in the same year the first experiment to split the nucleus in a fully controlled manner was performed by students working under his direction; John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton.

==Physical chemistry==
Physical Chemistry (originally the department of Colloid Science led by Eric Rideal) had left the old Cavendish site, subsequently locating as the Department of Physical Chemistry (under RG Norrish) in the then new chemistry building with the Department of Chemistry (led by Lord Todd) in Lensfield Road: both chemistry departments merged in the 1980s.

==Nuclear physics==
In World War II the laboratory carried out research for the MAUD Committee, part of the British Tube Alloys project of research into the atomic bomb. Researchers included Nicholas Kemmer, Alan Nunn May, Anthony French, Samuel Curran and the French scientists including Lew Kowarski and Hans von Halban. Several transferred to Canada in 1943; the Montreal Laboratory and some later to the Chalk River Laboratories.
The production of plutonium and neptunium by bombarding uranium-238 with neutrons was predicted in 1940 by two teams working independently: Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather at the Cavendish and Edwin M. McMillan and Philip Abelson at Berkeley Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley.

==Biology==
The Cavendish Laboratory has had an important influence on biology, mainly through the application of X-ray crystallography to the study of structures of biological molecules. Francis Crick already worked in the Medical Research Council Unit, headed by Max Perutz and housed in the Cavendish Laboratory, when James Watson came from the United States and they made a breakthrough in discovering the structure of DNA. For their work while in the Cavendish Laboratory, they were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962, together with Maurice Wilkins of King&#x27;s College London, himself a graduate of St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

The discovery was made on 28 February 1953; the first Watson/Crick paper appeared in &quot;Nature&quot; on 25 April 1953. Sir Lawrence Bragg, the director of the Cavendish Laboratory, where Watson and Crick worked, gave a talk at Guy&#x27;s Hospital Medical School in London on Thursday 14 May 1953 which resulted in an article by Ritchie Calder in the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; of London, on Friday 15 May 1953, entitled &quot;Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life.&quot; The news reached readers of &quot;The New York Times&quot; the next day; Victor K. McElheny, in researching his biography, &quot;Watson and DNA: Making a Scientific Revolution&quot;, found a clipping of a six-paragraph &quot;New York Times&quot; article written from London and dated 16 May 1953 with the headline &quot;Form of `Life Unit&#x27; in Cell Is Scanned.&quot; The article ran in an early edition and was then pulled to make space for news deemed more important. (&quot;The New York Times&quot; subsequently ran a longer article on 12 June 1953). The Cambridge University undergraduate newspaper &quot;Varsity&quot; also ran its own short article on the discovery on Saturday 30 May 1953. Bragg&#x27;s original announcement of the discovery at a Solvay Conference on proteins in Belgium on 8 April 1953 went unreported by the British press.

Sydney Brenner, Jack Dunitz, Dorothy Hodgkin, Leslie Orgel, and Beryl M. Oughton, were some of the first people in April 1953 to see the model of the structure of DNA, constructed by Crick and Watson; at the time they were working at the University of Oxford&#x27;s Chemistry Department. All were impressed by the new DNA model, especially Brenner who subsequently worked with Crick at Cambridge in the Cavendish Laboratory and the new Laboratory of Molecular Biology. According to the late Dr. Beryl Oughton, later Rimmer, they all travelled together in two cars once Dorothy Hodgkin announced to them that they were off to Cambridge to see the model of the structure of DNA. Orgel also later worked with Crick at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.

==Present site==


Due to overcrowding in the old buildings, it moved to its present site in West Cambridge in the early 1970s. It is due to move again to a third site currently under construction in West Cambridge.

<text>Gascoyne is a city in Bowman County, North Dakota, United States. The population was 21 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The city was founded in 1907 and known originally as Fischbein before the name was changed to Gascoyne on March 25, 1908. The new name came from a construction foreman on the Milwaukee Road transcontinental rail line that was built through the city, though an alternate explanation suggests that the name refers to the large deposits of natural gas found in the area.

Reserves of lignite coal are also found in the area, and Gascoyne was the site of a coal mine for much of the 20th century. The most active period for the mine occurred between 1975 and 1995, when about 2.5 million tons of lignite were produced per year, primarily for the Big Stone Power Plant near Big Stone City, South Dakota. The mine began ceasing production in 1995, and was shut down completely in 1997. In 2001, Westmoreland Coal Company purchased the mine with an intent to resume mining and construct a 500 megawatt power plant on site. These plans were later suspended in 2008 due to environmental concerns.

<text>Portal is a city in Burke County, North Dakota, United States. The population was 125 at the 2020 census. Portal was founded in 1893.

Portal sits along the Canada–United States border and is a major port of entry border crossing for road (connecting US Route 52 and Saskatchewan Highway 39) and rail traffic. North Portal, Saskatchewan is just over the border north of Portal and adjacent to it. It is one of three year-round, 24-hour ports in North Dakota (the others being Dunseith and Pembina).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==Economy==
Because Portal is in the Bakken Oil Field region, the cost of living has risen considerably in recent years. A 2015 speech by a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official used Portal as an example of an area where the cost of living, combined with limited housing availability, and the distance from medical care and shopping, can make it difficult to attract employees for federal government positions.

The Portal State Bank, built in 1903, is on the National Register of Historic Places. The William E. Metzger House, built in 1904 - 1905, is also on the National Register of Historic Places.

A notable tourist attraction is the Gateway Cities Golf Club. It is one of only two golf courses along the border, the other being the Aroostook Valley Country Club in Maine. Eight of the course&#x27;s nine holes are located within Canada, but the course&#x27;s ninth hole, and the clubhouse, are located in the United States.

<text>Amenia ( ) is a city in Cass County, North Dakota, United States. The population was 85 at the 2020 census. Amenia was founded in 1880.

The town is the site of several transmitter towers of Fargo broadcast television and radio stations.

Amenia was the home of North Dakota governor William L. Guy before and after holding office.

==History==
The town of Amenia traces its roots to a group of wealthy New England investors from the villages of Amenia, New York and Sharon, Connecticut which formed the Amenia and Sharon Land Company and, in July 1875, under the representation of Eben W. Chaffee, purchased of land from the then bankrupt Northern Pacific Railroad. The stockholders&#x27; plan had been to develop the land enough to sell it to settlers, thus quickly realizing a return on the investors shares. However, taking notice of the success of the Cass-Cheney-Dalrymple bonanza farm near Casselton, North Dakota, and the exceptional fertility of the soil, Chaffee convinced the stockholders to hold the land and break the prairie sod for the production of wheat. The company built a depot and, in 1881, a grain elevator in order to move their product to market. Around them grew the village of Amenia. By the mid-1880s, the town had grown enough to require school services and to build a Congregational church. Chaffee was among its earliest residents and continued to be a central figure in the development of the town.

<text>Casselton is a city in Cass County, North Dakota, United States. The population was 2,479 at the 2020 census. making it the 20th largest city in North Dakota. Casselton was founded in 1876. The city is named in honor of George Washington Cass, a president of the Northern Pacific Railway, which established a station there in 1876 to develop a town for homesteaders. Casselton is the hometown of five North Dakota governors.

==History==
Casselton had its origin in 1873 when the Northern Pacific Railway sent Mike Smith to plant cottonwood and willow trees in the area to serve as windbreaks along the right-of-way. They planned to harvest the trees for lumber to use as railroad ties, but the experiment failed for a number of reasons.

In 1874, Emil Priewe and his wife joined Mike Smith at the station. The Priewe&#x27;s son, Harry, was born on March 28, 1875, in a sod shanty, the first child born in the developing village. Others came to settle and by 1880, the town had a population of 376, according to the official census. A school was organized in 1876 and the town was incorporated as a village in 1880.

The hamlet was variously called &quot;the Nursery&quot;, &quot;Goose Creek&quot; and &quot;Swan Creek&quot;, named for the stream that meandered through the area. In 1876, the railroad established a station called Casstown, after George Cass, the railroad president. When the post office was established on August 8, 1876, the name Casselton was designated.
During the 1870s, George Cass and Peter Cheney traded their railroad stock for of land near Casselton and decided to develop the property as one large farm, rather than dividing the land into small tracts. They employed Oliver Dalrymple, of southern Minnesota, to head the operation. These Bonanza farms became highly successful and proved that the prairie was very suitable for agriculture.

Various means were used to attract immigrants from Europe and migrants from the East looking for a piece of land or the chance to become tradesmen and professionals. Casselton&#x27;s population reached 1,365 in 1885.

The Great Northern Railway had an additional influence in the growth of Casselton. Several branches radiated from the city. The railroad excavated a reservoir to supply water for its steam engines. In 1906 the railway constructed a round house and service center which operated until 1920. In the 1920s, railroad personnel were transferred to other locations, and as a result, the population of Casselton fell 285 persons between 1920 and 1930.

Casselton installed a city water and sewer system in the mid-1920s. Water was pumped from artesian wells, and stored in a standpipe which was located on the east part of town. Today, that site is used as a winter skating rink. Looking like a gigantic culvert, the standpipe was tall and was kept until 1956.

By 1957, the Great Northern Railway no longer had a need for the Casselton reservoir. They deeded the of land, which encompassed that body of water, to the City of Casselton. The reservoir was developed to be used as a municipal water supply until March 1978, when the city&#x27;s water started to come from the Leonard Phase of the Cass Water Users System. The reservoir area has since been developed into a recreational center with softball diamonds, tennis courts, picnic tables and the like.

The streets of Casselton were improved through municipal and state efforts. In 1927, the downtown roads were graveled. In 1930, as a US Works Progress Administration project under the President Franklin D. Roosevelt administration during the Great Depression, the federal government paid local workers to pave State Highway No. 18 through the city. After World War II, the business district streets were paved with concrete. Since that time, all streets and avenues have been hard-topped, and a modern storm sewer system was installed at the same time.

The 1996–1997 school year opened with a newly completed, nearly $8 million Central Cass Public School building. It replaced a three-story building on the same site, that was dedicated in 1912 and cost $50,000. The school district covers nearly , and attracts over 800 students. Because of the continued growth, an addition to the school complex was completed in time for the 2003–2004 school year.

Casselton is known for its population of American red squirrels. Central Cass High School uses the squirrel as its mascot.

===2013 train derailment===
On December 30, 2013, a westbound BNSF train carrying soybeans derailed approximately one mile west of Casselton. An adjacent eastbound BNSF train carrying crude oil struck wreckage from the westbound train (accident location ). The collision ignited the crude oil and caused a chain of large explosions, which were heard and felt several miles away. The resulting fireball created a massive cloud of black smoke, which prompted authorities to issue a voluntary evacuation of the city and surrounding area as a precaution. The National Transportation Safety Board conducted an investigation, and in 2017 issued findings of probable cause, starting with a broken axle on the westbound train.

Although no casualties were reported, as the crew of the crude oil train abandoned the lead locomotives before they were engulfed in flames as soon as they had derailed and come to stop in a snowbank, the incident occurred in proximity to a populated area and renewed safety concerns regarding the transportation of hazardous materials by rail, especially in the wake of the Lac-Mégantic derailment in Canada earlier in the year. Casselton mayor Ed McConnell, acknowledging that the town &quot;dodged a bullet&quot;, publicly called on the federal government to review the dangers and urged lawmakers to consider pipelines as a safer option.

<text>Fargo is the most populous city in the U.S. state of North Dakota and the seat of Cass County. The population was 125,990 at the 2020 census, which was estimated to have grown to 133,188 in 2023, making it the 218th-most populous city in the United States. Fargo, along with its twin city of Moorhead, Minnesota, form the core of the Fargo–Moorhead metropolitan statistical area, which had a population of 248,591 in 2020.

Fargo was founded in 1871 on the Red River of the North floodplain. It is a cultural, retail, health care, educational, and industrial center for southeastern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota. North Dakota State University is located in the city.

==History==
===Early history===
Historically part of Sioux (Dakota) territory, the area that is present-day Fargo was an early stopping point for steamboats traversing the Red River during the 1870s and 1880s. The city was originally named &quot;Centralia&quot;, but was later renamed &quot;Fargo&quot; after Northern Pacific Railway director and Wells Fargo Express Company founder William Fargo (1818–1881). During the initial settlement of Fargo, there developed two cities: one (unofficially) called &quot;Fargo on the Prairie&quot; and the other &quot;Fargo in the Timber&quot;. &quot;Fargo on the Prairie&quot; was known for being well run by Northern Pacific engineers, while &quot;Fargo in the Timber&quot; remained mostly lawless and full of apparently &quot;desperate and reckless characters&quot;, according to The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead. Eventually, &quot;Fargo in the Timber&quot; would see its demise after a crackdown by federal authorities, and the modern Fargo would develop out of &quot;Fargo on the Prairie&quot;. The area started to flourish after the arrival of the Northern Pacific Railroad and the city became known as the &quot;Gateway to the West.&quot;

During the 1880s, Fargo became the &quot;divorce capital&quot; of the Midwest because of lenient divorce laws. A major fire struck the city on June 7, 1893, destroying 31 blocks of downtown Fargo, but the city was immediately rebuilt with new buildings made of brick, new streets, and a water system. More than 246 new buildings were built within one year. There were several rumors concerning the cause of the fire.

The North Dakota Agricultural College was founded in 1890 as North Dakota&#x27;s land-grant university, becoming first accredited by the North Central Association in 1915. In 1960, NDAC became known as North Dakota State University.

===20th century===
Early in the century, the automobile industry flourished, and in 1905, Fargo became home to the Pence Automobile Company, a company that at one time distributed 29% of all Buicks. In addition, Fargo also hosted a regional Ford assembly plant, which by 1917 was assembling some 70 cars per day. The plant would remain in operation until 1956.

On Labor Day in 1910, Theodore Roosevelt visited Fargo to lay the cornerstone of the college&#x27;s new library. To a crowd of 30,000, Roosevelt spoke about his first visit to Fargo 27 years earlier, and credited his experience homesteading in North Dakota for his eventual rise to the presidency.

Fargo-Moorhead boomed after World War II, and the city grew rapidly. In 1957, it experienced the 1957 Fargo tornado that destroyed a large part of the north end of the city. Ted Fujita, famous for his Fujita tornado scale, analyzed pictures of the Fargo tornado, helping him develop his ideas for &quot;wall cloud&quot; and &quot;tail cloud.&quot; These were the first major scientific descriptive terms associated with tornadoes. The construction of two interstates (I-29 and I-94) revolutionized travel in the region and pushed growth of Fargo to the south and west of the city limits. In 1972, the West Acres Shopping Center, the largest shopping mall in North Dakota, was constructed near the intersection of the two Interstates. This mall became a catalyst for retail growth in the area.

===Recent history===

Fargo has continued to expand rapidly but steadily. Since the mid-1980s, the bulk of new residential growth has occurred in the south and southwest zones of the area (for example in West Fargo) due to geographic constraints on the north side. The city&#x27;s major retail districts on the southwest side have likewise seen rapid development.

Downtown Fargo has been gentrified due in part to investments by the city and private developers in the Renaissance Zone. Most older neighborhoods, such as Horace Mann, have either avoided decline or been revitalized through housing rehabilitation promoted by planning agencies to strengthen the city&#x27;s core.

NDSU has grown rapidly into a major research university and forms a major component of the city&#x27;s identity and economy. Most students live off-campus in the surrounding Roosevelt neighborhood. The university has established a presence downtown through both academic buildings and apartment housing. In addition, NDSU Bison Football has gained a significant following among many area residents. In recent years, Fargo has also become a regional technology and healthcare hub, as a result of Microsoft and Sanford Health both building regional campuses in the city center.

Since the late 1990s, the Fargo-Moorhead Metropolitan Statistical Area has consistently had one of the lowest unemployment rates among MSAs in the United States.

On July 14, 2023, 37-year-old Mohamad Barakat opened fire on a group of police officers in the city who were responding to an unrelated traffic accident. One officer was killed and two others were injured before Barakat was killed by one of the officers at the scene.

==Geography==
Fargo is a core city of the Fargo-Moorhead, ND–MN Combined Statistical Area, which also includes Moorhead, West Fargo, and Dilworth and outlying communities.

Fargo sits on the western bank of the Red River of the North in a flat geographic region known as the Red River Valley. The Red River Valley resulted from the withdrawal of glacial Lake Agassiz, which drained away about 9,300 years ago. The lake sediments deposited from Lake Agassiz made the land around Fargo some of the richest in the world for agricultural uses.

Seasonal floods due to the rising water of the Red River, which flows from the United States into Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba, Canada, have presented challenges. The Red flows northward, which means melting snow and river ice, as well as runoff from its tributaries, often create ice dams causing the river to overflow. Fargo&#x27;s surrounding Red River Valley terrain is essentially flat, leading to overland flooding. Since the potentially devastating 2009 Red River flood, both Fargo and Moorhead have taken great strides in flood protection; only a near-record flood would cause concern today. Work on the FM Diversion has begun and upon completion, it will permanently floodproof the metro for 500-year floods.

Its location makes the city vulnerable to flooding during seasons with above-average precipitation. The Red River&#x27;s minor flood stage in Fargo begins at a level of 18 feet, with major flooding categorized at 30 feet and above. Many major downtown roadways and access to Moorhead are closed off at this level. Record snowfalls late in 1996 led to flooding in 1997, causing the Red to rise to a record crest of 39.5 feet, nearly overtaking city defenses. In 2008–2009, significant fall precipitation coupled with rapid snowmelt in March 2009 caused the Red to rise to a new record level of 40.84 feet, but again Fargo remained safe, in large part due to flood mitigation efforts instituted after the 1997 event and sandbagging efforts by the city residents. Further upgrades were made to city infrastructure and additional resources brought to bear following the 2009 flood, which caused no issues for the city in 2010 despite another rapid melt that caused the Red to rise to 37 feet (which ranks among the top-ten highest levels ever recorded). The estimated $1.5 billion FM diversion project is under construction and will channel the Red&#x27;s water away from the city. As of 2012, Fargo has bought 700 houses in flood-prone areas.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===
Because of its location in the Great Plains and its distance from both mountains and oceans, Fargo has an extreme humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;, bordering on &quot;Dwb&quot;), featuring long, bitterly cold winters and warm to hot, humid summers. It lies in USDA Plant hardiness zone 4a. The city features winters among the coldest in the contiguous United States; the coldest month of January has a normal mean temperature of . There is an annual average of 43 days with a minimum of or lower. Snowfall averages per season. Spring and autumn are short and highly variable seasons. Summers have frequent thunderstorms, and the warmest month, July, has a normal mean temperature of ; highs reach on an average of 12.7 days each year. Annual precipitation of is concentrated in the warmer months. Record temperatures have ranged from on January 8, 1887, to on July 6, 1936; the record coldest daily maximum is on January 22, 1936, while, conversely, the record warmest daily minimum was , set four days after the all-time record high. On average, the first and last dates to see a minimum at or below the freezing mark are September 30 and May 8, respectively, allowing a growing season of 144 days.

In 2011, Fargo won The Weather Channel&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Toughest Weather City&quot; poll. After almost 850,000 votes, blizzards, cold, and floods secured the title for the city.

The meetings are broadcast on a Government-access television (GATV) cable channel.

In 2017, there was an attempt to recall City Commissioner Dave Piepkorn by a group who argued his constant expressing of concern over refugee resettlement in the city was a xenophobic dog-whistle meant to rile up anti-refugee sentiment in the community. While the group says it did reach the required number of signatures, it ultimately chose not to submit them because they did not know how many signatures would be eliminated in the review process, and Commissioner Piepkorn threatened to obtain the list of signers via FOIA request, which was interpreted as a political threat by the group.

Fargo was historically a Republican-leaning area. As recently as the 2004 presidential election, George W. Bush carried Fargo as well as the rest of Cass County with nearly 60 percent of the vote in both areas. Fargo has become more politically diverse and competitive. Since 2008, no Republican presidential candidate has received over 50% of the vote in Cass County.

==Notable people==
==In popular culture==
&quot;Fargo&quot; is an Academy Award-winning 1996 black comedy film directed by the Coen brothers, which takes place primarily throughout Minnesota. Fargo is only seen briefly at the film&#x27;s opening scene set in a bar and mentioned only twice in the film. None of &quot;Fargo&quot; was shot on location in or near Fargo. A television series based on the film debuted in 2014, and occasionally featured the city in episodes.

Fargo was the setting of Season 1 Episode 1 of &quot;Project Blue Book&quot;. The episode was based loosely on a UFO encounter called the Gorman dogfight taking place over the area.

Fargo has three sister cities:
*Hamar, Norway

<text>West Fargo is a city in Cass County, North Dakota, United States. It is, as of the 2020 census, the fifth most populous city in the state of North Dakota with a population of 38,626, and it is one of the state&#x27;s fastest growing cities. The city is part of the Fargo-Moorhead, ND-MN Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
West Fargo began as a whistle stop called &quot;Sheyenne Crossing&quot; on the Northern Pacific Railway, named for the nearby Sheyenne River.

A post office operated from 1874 to 1885.

The settlement was renamed &quot;Haggartville&quot;, and then &quot;Haggart&quot;, after the owner of the land, John E. Haggart, a businessman who served as postmaster, U.S. marshall, and first sheriff of Cass County. Settlers began arriving in the area, and in 1876 the first school was built, School District No. 6.

Equity Co-op Packing Company was formed by a group of farmer, and the Equity Packing Plant—a meat processing plant—was erected in the settlement in 1919. Twenty-four homes were built, as well as a hotel, restaurant, and general store. The Equity company fell into bankruptcy in 1922, and was sold to Armour and Company in 1925, when the settlement&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Village of West Fargo&quot;. The settlement was a major agricultural processor during the 1930s, and most of the residents were meat packinghouse workers; teams at West Fargo High School continue to be called the &quot;packers&quot;. The plant utilized an assembly line to process meat, and its motto stated it used &quot;every part of the animal except the squeal.&quot; The plant also produced fertilizer, adhesives, and soap. The meat packing era ended in West Fargo when the Armour plant closed in 1960.

In 1989, the cities of West Fargo and Riverside merged.

<text>Langdon is a city in Cavalier County, North Dakota, United States. It is the county seat of Cavalier County. The population was 1,909 at the 2020 census. Langdon was designated as the county seat in 1884, was founded in 1885, and was incorporated on February 25, 1888.

==History==
A post office has been in operation in Langdon since 1886. The city was named for Robert Bruce Langdon, a politician and railroad official.

On October 29, 1887, &quot;The Courier&quot;, an early Langdon newspaper, reported that Rosa Lake, Lemon, Olga, and Langdon were all vying for the position of county seat. Anecdotal stories tell of several settlers who succeeded in voting several times by simply changing their hats and coats. When all votes were tallied, it was found that Langdon had polled 301 votes, Olga 246, Rosa Lake 55, and Lemon 11. It was alleged that the Langdon precinct had cast 150 votes with a total of only 50 qualified voters. However, the county seat remained in Langdon.

On Memorial Day (then called Decoration Day) 1909, a tornado struck on the prairie a mile to a mile and a half southeast of Langdon, then moved seven miles in a northwest direction. The tornado, locally dubbed The Vulcan, killed five people and injured 29. The Vulcan was part of an outbreak of tornadoes called the Decoration Day Massacre, the second deadliest tornado outbreak in North Dakota&#x27;s recorded history, killing 12 people in Langdon and surrounding communities.

In Langdon, Mrs. M.L. Sullivan ran for safety but the tornado hit as she arrived at her cellar door. When the winds subsided, she was standing in the cellar with its broken doorknob in her hand. Katie Diamond was lifted above treetops and telephone poles, and then dropped in a yard, virtually unscathed. The tornado destroyed many barns, two elevators, the Great Northern water tank and several feet of railroad track.

In the winter of 1935–36 Langdon recorded 75 consecutive days with a high temperature below , and 32 consecutive days with a high temperature colder than .

==Education==

Langdon&#x27;s high school underwent a name change because of surrounding schools closing. The school was renamed &quot;Langdon Area High School&quot; (instead of &quot;Langdon High School&quot;) in the fall of 2001. The official mascot of Langdon Area High School is the Cardinal.

Students from Langdon Area Schools perform better than state averages in several areas. Graduation rates, for example, typically exceed state averages by several points. Since 2005, in all areas where comparable statistics were available, Langdon outperformed state averages from 4.5% to 15.4%.

Langdon&#x27;s students also tend to outperform their District&#x27;s Adequate Yearly Progress goals in both the proficiency and participation categories. In some cases, these differences are quite significant. For example, the District&#x27;s 2007–2008 proficiency goal in mathematics was 65.5%, whereas the district&#x27;s actual proficiency was measured at 97.7%, a difference of 32.2%. A similarly large difference can be seen in reading proficiency scores. Despite this high achievement, however, the District is not considered by the state to have achieved Annual Yearly Progress in the 2007–2008 school year. However, this may be a statistical anomaly given the District&#x27;s consistently high performance in previous years. For example, in the 2006–2007 school year, reading participation was 100% and mathematics participation was 99.5%. Even though the 2007–2008 rates in these areas were very high (97.7% in both cases) such a score still represents a decline from previous years. Similar patterns of small declines from already high figures can be seen in the areas of graduation rates (0.4% decline, from 95% to 94.6%) and attendance (0.1% decline, from 97.3% to 97.2%). These small changes may keep the District from being listed as having made adequate yearly progress, despite their high overall proficiency. Additionally, in some areas the 2007–2008 figures represent significant improvement over those from the 2006–2007 school year, where Landgon underperformed state averages in the key areas of reading (−10.2%) and mathematics (−7.4%) proficiency. This indicates a positive trend for the District, although one which will need to reevaluated when the 2008–2009 data become available to determine whether it is part of a larger pattern or not.

In addition to student academic performance, average daily attendance at Langdon Area Schools is slightly higher than the state average (97.2% versus 96.7%), a general pattern which has held true since at least 2005.

<text>Sheyenne is a city in Eddy County, North Dakota, United States. The population was 186 at the 2020 census. Sheyenne was founded in 1883. A community center and the Log Cabin Museum are located on Main Street (U.S. Route 281). On the east end of town there is a park with campsites located on Warsing Dam. Sheyenne is also home to two Lutheran churches: Grace Lutheran and First Lutheran.

==History==

The name &quot;Sheyenne&quot; is derived from the nearby Sheyenne River which was named after the Cheyenne Indians. The first explorers in the area misspelled the name, thus changing the &quot;C&quot; to an &quot;S&quot;.
Herds of bison once roamed the prairies near the town of Sheyenne. The Sioux tribe were the final Native American tribe to move towards the area. The first white settlers came via the Northern Pacific Railroad Company. The earliest mention of the settlement came through the Grand Forks, North Dakota-based paper, &quot;Normadden&quot;. The Norwegian language paper mentioned the building of the section house in 1885 and the setting up of six tents in order to establish a townsite and a depot. The main track was laid on November 28, 1884. The railroad began operation to Sheyenne on August 6, 1885.

The main townsite of Sheyenne was obtained by Clarence E. Bennett in 1885, but later came under the jurisdiction of J. W. Richter, who dedicated the townsite in 1892. The first crops grown in the area were common vegetables and as much wheat that the land could take. The main source of meat was hunting on the abundant plains, and the other source was in the Sheyenne River. People streamed into the community from all parts of the United States and Europe. Most European settlers came from Scandinavia and Germany. Businesses flourished off railroad workers and farmers.

===Fire of 1894===
On December 7, 1894 at approximately 4:30 A.M., a fire began in the George Williams Livery Barn and spread to other businesses on Main Street. Williams&#x27; billiard room and soft drink shop were the next to be consumed. The blaze then spread to the Westerlund Hotel and the Hugh Peoples General Store. The post office also caught fire, but N.U. Hanson saved all the mail that was on-hand.
The fire was determined to be incendiary in origin. George Williams closed his stables at 2:00 A.M. and locked the door. When firemen arrived at the scene, they realized that the door was open, and later it was determined that the fire began in the unused box stall.
In the wake of the disaster, the merchants rebuilt and continued serving the Sheyenne area.

Sheyenne was home to C.G. Hayes, a farmer by trade who lived South of the townsite. Hayes became a soldier and was stationed at Fort Totten. He became a scout during the Indian Wars in the Northwest. After that, he served under the Seventh Cavalry banner, and was one of the messengers who sent for reinforcements after The Battle of the Little Bighorn.
In 1897, Sheyenne began publishing its first newspaper, &quot;The Sheyenne Star&quot;.

===The 1900s===
Settlers and immigrants continued to swarm to the area as they came via boxcar and train. They also arrived by cars and wagons. Businesses in Sheyenne included numerous department stores, meat markets, livery stables, a depot, a blacksmith shop operated by Hans Stenberg, Odegaard&#x27;s Shop, a feed mill, and land companies. Sheyenne had several elevators that stored different local goods. There was a Ford dealership, numerous service stations, numerous pharmacies, cafes, a hotel, a public bath, and a lumberyard. A cream station, an opera house, and a variety store also existed in Sheyenne at one time. Many banks have come and gone over the brief period of Sheyenne&#x27;s existence, including the Farmers&#x27; State Bank.

===Creamery Day Celebration 1913===
The opening of the creamery in Sheyenne was the largest event in Sheyenne history in terms of turnout. The event was created to celebrate the opening of Sheyenne&#x27;s creamery on June 28, 1913. Over 2000 people were present at the event. The festivities began with a parade that covered 22 blocks that included the Fort Totten Indian Band, the Boy Scouts, and numerous merchants&#x27; floats. The parade ended at the creamery, where everyone was served free ice cream and buttermilk. Over 1900 ice cream cones were served. The climax of the day was when Professor G.F. Martin of North Dakota Agricultural College, now North Dakota State University, spoke about the importance of dairy. A baseball game was then played between Sheyenne and New Rockford, and at 9:00 a grand ball was held at the opera house.

===1914–present===
The Sheyenne area progressed through World War I and the 1918 influenza epidemic. A shock to the area came in the 1930s with the Great Depression, when the main industry of the area, agriculture, was threatened severely. Poor crop prices influenced Sheyenne&#x27;s economy and the WPA was crucial to the life of Sheyenne. It created a park on the south side of Sheyenne that is now owned by the VFW, it restored the town jail, and its workers built Warsing Dam on the outskirts of the city.
In the 1940s numerous residents fought in World War II, and the &quot;Sheyenne Star&quot; ceased publication.
In 1955, the second irrigation experimental farm in North Dakota was planned on the land of Bruce Larson, while a major concern of the late 1950s was the high nitrate condition in the wells of Sheyenne. The problem was solved by the Northern Pacific Railway Company donating their well to the City of Sheyenne.
A major event in the 1960s was the opening of the Tastee-Freez, a fast food and ice cream restaurant, in the building previously occupied by the city&#x27;s fire department.
Community betterment was the highlight of the 1970s in Sheyenne, when projects such as street paving, tennis courts, townhouses, a museum, and main street revitalization were finished. In 1977 Sheyenne won the North Dakota Community Betterment Award for its work on its projects.

Sheyenne celebrated its 125th with a demo-derby, BBQ dinner, parade, school reunion, fireworks, and a children&#x27;s theater production, put on by the S.T.A.R.S.

==Sites of interest==

* Log Cabin Museum is a pioneer museum showcasing the history of the Sheyenne area. The building was built in 1867 near Fort Totten, North Dakota. It was brought to Sheyenne as part of a community betterment program in the 1970s and was expanded soon after. The original woodwork can be seen in the cabin today. The Log Cabin Museum contains many historic items from the area such as a barber chair, &quot;Sheyenne Star&quot; newspapers, and articles of clothing owned by John Aasen—one of the tallest actors in history. It also shows off many Native American artifacts that were found in the region. There is also a Japanese rifle from World War II on display at the museum.
* Warsing Dam is a man-made dam on the eastern side of Sheyenne featuring camping and fishing.

==Education==

Before the first Sheyenne school was built, classes in 1886 were held in a sod house, but soon a wood-frame building was built west of the Sheyenne&#x27;s railroad tracks. The first school in Sheyenne was moved to Richter Avenue, and when it became too small, it became the office for the Sheyenne Star newspaper. In 1897, a two-story schoolhouse was built, and the first floor could be used for school purposes only, whereas the second floor could be used for meetings and church services. In 1898, school was closed for two weeks due to an outbreak of scarlet fever and measles. In the first months of 1903, many pupils left the Sheyenne school to attend Scandinavian Studies in Greenfield Township. In April 1903, school was prohibited due to a smallpox outbreak. In 1908, a new school was built on the eastern side of Sheyenne and in 1930, an addition was made to the two-story brick building. In the late 1950s, it was decided to add on once again. While the project was in progress, the Ostby Hall and Grace Lutheran Church were used as overflow classrooms. In 1962, the project was completed. The Sheyenne High School lasted for 99 years until the spring of 2007, when it closed for its pupils. Today, most children living in and around Sheyenne attend school in nearby New Rockford because Sheyenne is part of the New Rockford-Sheyenne Public School.

<text>Linton is a city in and the county seat of Emmons County, North Dakota, United States. The population was 1,071 at the 2020 census. When compared with the other 356 cities in North Dakota, Linton ranks in the top twelve percent based on the number of its residents. The city serves as a governmental, commercial and business hub for Emmons County.

A nearby historic site listed on the National Register of Historic Places is Sacred Heart Cemetery, Wrought-Iron Cross Site, in or near Linton.

==History==
In August 1898, land located in the geographic center of Emmons County in Section 7 of Township 132 North, Range 76 West, of the Fifth Principal Meridian, was surveyed and platted by W.E. Petrie into lots, streets and alleys explicitly for the purpose of creating a seat for Emmons County. The site was named Linton, after George W. Lynn, who had settled in Emmons County in 1885. He was a farmer, lawyer, Emmons County&#x27;s first States Attorney and for a while was the publisher of the Emmons County &quot;Free Press&quot;. The plat was filed with the register of deeds on December 30, 1898. Linton was incorporated as a village on April 26, 1906; and incorporated as a city on April 6, 1914. Charles Patterson, editor of the &quot;Emmons County Republican&quot;, was Linton&#x27;s first postmaster, having received his commission for the post in March 1899.

Linton received its first connection via long-distance telephone in 1905 when the Northwestern Telephone Exchange Company established a line from Fargo to Bismarck and created a branch line to Linton. At the same time Bismarck was connected to the line of the South Dakota system so that each of the communities could communicate with each other in this way.

===Notable persons from Linton===
Roman Catholic bishop Austin Anthony Vetter was born in Linton.

===The creation of Linton===
.
The creation of Linton was the result of a political dispute between residents in the northern half of Emmons County and those in the southern half. In 1885, two years after the county was officially organized, the county seat was in the town of Williamsport, which was located in the northern half of the county in Township 135N, Range 76W, Section 15 on the east side of what is today 9th Ave. SE between 62nd St. SE and the vacated 63rd St. SE, two and a half miles northeast of Hazelton. The people in the southern half were upset because the county seat was so far away and most of the county leaders were from the north. Moreover, the northern part was more densely settled than the southern part, so this created problems when it came time to vote because the higher population numbers gave &quot;Northerners&quot; greater influence on issues. Eventually, it was decided to take a vote to see if residents favored dividing the county in two. If successful, the northern half would continue to be named Emmons—with Williamsport remaining the county seat—while the southern half would be named Winona with the town of Winona serving as the new county seat of government.
When the votes were tallied, residents had decided against splitting the county. However this did not end the dispute, and the effort to move the seat of government from Williamsport to Winona continued. Three votes were taken during the 1880s and 1890s. The first two failed completely. The third resulted in a decision to move the county seat to the center of the county and create a new town, which eventually become the city of Linton. People in the North still wanted to keep the seat at Williamsport, however, so they preferred charges claiming that the election was &quot;fraudulent and illegal&quot;, and obtained a court injunction to prevent the move. Southerners became so incensed by this action that they went to Williamsport in January 1899 to take possession of the county records and transfer them to the new county seat. The men were armed, and they met no resistance and took the records, including, according to an account by then-constable John Bartu, a two-ton safe (this safe is now in the collection of the Emmons County Museum in Linton). No charges were brought against the men, although the Williamsport interests succeeded in having the records brought back to their city and causing another election to be ordered which would require the approval of a majority of two-thirds of the voters to have Linton retain its position as county seat (this election was never held). Although the records were brought back to Linton, the case dragged on in the courts for several months, during which time it was expected that it would end up in the state supreme court. The matter was finally settled when E.S. Allen, the attorney for the people of Williamsport, moved that the case be dismissed, whereby the city of Linton prevailed and the seat of Emmons County has remained there ever since. As a result of losing its position as the county seat, and because the Northern Pacific Railway preferred the Linton location when they built a branch to the area in about 1897, Williamsport ceased to exist as a community by the early years of the 20th century and the site today is occupied by farmland. 
The community&#x27;s oldest newspaper, &quot;The Emmons County Record&quot;, began publication with 75 copies printed on June 10, 1884 in Williamsport but was relocated to Linton by Darwin R. Streeter, its founder, in 1899. Streeter continued as the newspaper&#x27;s publisher until January 1914, at which time full control of it passed into the hands of his son Frank. The newspaper has been published continuously since the time of its founding.

<text>Beach is a city in and the county seat of Golden Valley County in the State of North Dakota. The population was 981 at the 2020 census. Beach was incorporated in 1909. Walter Losinski was elected mayor of Beach in June 2022.

==History==
Beach was first settled &quot;circa&quot; 1900. It was named for Captain Warren C. Beach of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 11th Infantry. Beach had led an expedition of railroad surveyors through the area in 1880. The post office was established in 1902, and the town was incorporated first as a village in 1908 and as a city in 1909. It was named the county seat of Golden Valley County in 1912.

In April 1911, the then ex-president and long-term fixture of the Badlands region, Theodore Roosevelt, made his last trip to the area, stopping in Beach and nearby Medora. His visit to Medora passed without incident, but the visit to Beach was marred by a strongly negative reception to Roosevelt&#x27;s speech. He first expressed surprise that the town of Beach even existed, based upon such marginal land. This was undoubtedly due to the lack of flora and fauna, the wear and strain he endured in the 10 years he ranched in the area, and Rocky Mountain and Great Plains blizzard of 1886–7. Roosevelt&#x27;s speech had a strong conservationist element, suggesting to local ranchers there should only be one cow for every of land, which led to local disenchantment with the president.

The incident is likely to have critically influenced his commentary and estrangement with the region, culminating in October 1918. While giving a morale speech regarding World War I in then strongly anti-war North Dakota, a side trip to the Badlands was suggested. Roosevelt demurred, stating &quot;[i]t is a mistake for one to hit the back trail after many years have passed. One finds things have changed, the old picture destroyed, the romance gone . . . It&#x27;s best that it should be so, but I don&#x27;t want to see the place again. I&#x27;d rather try and remember it as it was.&quot;

==Geography==
Beach is located in western North Dakota along the border with Montana. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

<text>Golva is a city in Golden Valley County, North Dakota, United States. The population was 84 at the 2020 census. Golva was founded in 1915.

==History==
Golva is located in Lone Tree Township. The homesteaders that arrived in the area between 1900 and 1910 found only one tree in the area. That tree was standing about one mile (1.6 km) east of modern-day Golva till it died around 1980. According to the Homestead Act, the homesteaders got if they lived on the land for 7 years. In western North Dakota, they were also given another if they planted trees on the land, so there are now trees around most farmsteads in the area. The last living homesteader from the Golva area, Mrs. George (Emma) Geary, died in 1978, still owning her homestead and the house on it, although she had left the homestead in 1958 after breaking her hip. The doctors told her, due to the seriousness of the break, she would be bedridden for the rest of her life. Being a true pioneer, she responded &quot;The hell I will&quot;. She walked with one crutch and lived alone until shortly before her death at 89. Her neighbor for over 40 years, Eva Weinreis, wrote an autobiography entitled &quot;A Note On the Tea Kettle&quot; about her life and coming from Aberdeen, South Dakota in 1906 with her husband, Peter Weinreis, to homestead two miles (3 km) west of Burkey, North Dakota and two miles (3 km) south of modern-day Golva. The book told of the early history of the Golva area.

Golva was founded in 1915, when the Northern Pacific Railroad line came down from Beach, North Dakota. It was originally supposed to be the county seat of Golden Valley County and got the name Golva from the first three letters of Golden and first two letters of Valley, the name having been suggested by the original townsite owner, A.L. Martin. The &quot;Golden Valley&quot; name comes from the rolling valleys of golden wheat just before harvest. Prior to 1915, most of the local businesses were in Burkey, situated about four miles (6 km) southwest of Golva. St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church was built in Burkey in 1906, but moved to Golva shortly after it was founded. The Golva post office was established February 15, 1916. Other businesses moved from Burkey to Golva and Burkey literally disappeared within a couple of years.

Golva once had a business community which consisted of a hardware store, a grocery store, a car dealership, a lumberyard, two grain elevators, two bars, a few restaurants, and several other businesses. As of 2017, the businesses in the city were a lumberyard, a gas station, a grocery store, a bank and a grain elevator. Services consisted of the post office, and the St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic church.

<text>Grand Forks is a city in and the county seat of Grand Forks County, North Dakota, United States. The city&#x27;s population was 59,166 as of the 2020 census, making it the third-most populous city in the state, after Fargo and Bismarck. Grand Forks, along with its twin city of East Grand Forks, Minnesota, forms the center of the Grand Forks metropolitan statistical area, which is often called Greater Grand Forks or the Grand Cities.

Located on the western banks of the north-flowing Red River of the North, in a flat region known as the Red River Valley, the city is prone to flooding. The Red River Flood of 1997 devastated the city. Originally called &quot;Les Grandes Fourches&quot; by French fur traders from Canada, who had long worked and lived in the region, steamboat captain Alexander Griggs platted a community after being forced to winter there. The post office was established in 1870, and the town was incorporated on February 22, 1881. The city was named for its location at the fork of the Red River and the Red Lake River.

Initially dependent on local agriculture, the city&#x27;s economy has since broadened to include a wide variety of industries, including higher education, defense, health care, manufacturing, food processing, and scientific research. Grand Forks is served by Grand Forks International Airport and Grand Forks Air Force Base. The city&#x27;s University of North Dakota is the oldest institution of higher education in the state. The Alerus Center and Ralph Engelstad Arena host athletic and other events, while the Empire Arts Center and Chester Fritz Auditorium are the city&#x27;s largest cultural venues.

==History==

Prior to settlement by Europeans, the area where the city developed, at the forks of the Red River and Red Lake River for thousands of years, had been an important meeting and trading point for Native Americans. Early French explorers, fur trappers, and traders called the area &quot;Les Grandes Fourches,&quot; meaning &quot;The Grand Forks&quot;. By the 1740s, French fur trappers relied on &quot;Les Grandes Fourches&quot; as an important trading post. This was French colonial territory.

The United States acquired the territory from British Rupert&#x27;s Land with the Treaty of 1818, but indigenous tribes dominated the area until the late 19th century. After years of warfare, the United States made treaties to extinguish the land claims of the Ojibwe and other Native American peoples. When a U.S. post office was established on the site on June 15, 1870, the name was changed to the English &quot;Grand Forks&quot;. Alexander Griggs, a steamboat captain, is regarded as &quot;The Father of Grand Forks&quot;. Griggs&#x27; steamboat froze in the Red River on a voyage in late 1870, forcing the captain and his crew to spend the winter camping at Grand Forks. Griggs platted a community in 1875, and Grand Forks was officially incorporated on February 22, 1881.

Thousands of settlers were attracted to the Dakota Territory in the 1870s and 1880s for its cheap land, and the population began to rise. Many established small family farms, but some investors bought thousands of acres for bonanza farms, where they supervised the cultivation and harvesting of wheat as a commodity crop. The city grew quickly after the arrival of the Great Northern Railway in 1880 and the Northern Pacific Railway in 1887. In 1883, the University of North Dakota was established, six years before North Dakota was admitted as an independent state born from the Dakota Territory. Grand Forks was the site of one of the deadliest tornadoes in North Dakota&#x27;s history, then called an &quot;inland hurricane,&quot; in 1887. The storm killed at least six people.

During the first half of the 20th century, new residential neighborhoods were developed south and west of downtown Grand Forks. In the 1920s, the state-owned North Dakota Mill and Elevator was constructed on the city&#x27;s north side.

In 1954, Grand Forks was chosen as the site for an Air Force base. Grand Forks Air Force Base brought thousands of new jobs and residents to the community. The military base and the University of North Dakota became integral to the city&#x27;s economy. With construction of federal highways, during the postwar years residential and business development became suburbanized, spreading to new areas as land was available. Interstate 29 was built on the western side of the city, and two enclosed shopping malls—South Forks Plaza and Columbia Mall—were built on the south side.

The Red River had a history of seasonal flooding, aggravated by the broad ancient lake bed that formed the Red River Valley. The 1997 Red River flood caused extensive damage in the city. Fargo was upstream from the bulk of the flood waters that season, and Winnipeg had built an extensive system of flood control structures in the 1960s. In 1997, Grand Forks suffered the most damage of any major city in the Red River Valley. During the height of the flooding, a major fire destroyed 11 buildings in the downtown area. The government began developing a new levee system to protect the city, which was completed 10 years later. It required the relocation of numerous residents, as some neighborhoods were emptied for this construction.

The floodplain bordering the Red River was later converted into a large park known as the Greater Grand Forks Greenway. This provided new recreation space for city residents on both sides of the river, as well as space for future floodwaters to be absorbed naturally by trees and other plants, without damage to infrastructure.

New public and private developments have continued to expand Grand Forks&#x27;s footprint since the 1997 flood. Two new, large sports venues opened in 2001: the Alerus Center and the Ralph Engelstad Arena. Six years later, the Winnipeg-based Canad Inns hotel chain added a 13-story hotel and waterpark connected to the Alerus Center. Grand Forks also surpassed pre-flood level population, area employment, and taxable sales in 2007.

==Geography==
Grand Forks is north of the Fargo-Moorhead area and south of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Grand Forks is on the western bank of the Red River of the North in an area known as the Red River Valley. The term &quot;forks&quot; refers to the forking of the Red River with the Red Lake River near downtown Grand Forks. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water. Since it is in one of the flattest parts of the world, the city has few differences in elevation. There are no lakes within the city limits of Grand Forks, but the meandering Red River and the English Coulee flow through the community and provide some break in the terrain.

The Red River Valley is the result of an ancient glacier carving its way south during the last ice age. Once the glacier receded, it formed a glacial lake called Lake Agassiz. The valley is formed from the ancient lake bed. The ancient beaches can still be seen as rolling hills west of the city.

===Cityscape===
Grand Forks has several distinct neighborhoods. The area adjacent to the Red River developed first; this is where some of the oldest neighborhoods, including the downtown area, can be found. The area between downtown and the University of North Dakota campus was another early growth area, and historic properties can be found here, as well.

Downtown Grand Forks contains many recognized historic buildings. It is the governmental center of the city and county. It is also used as a gathering place for large community events and festivals. A farmer&#x27;s market takes place every Saturday from mid-June to mid-September in the Town Square at the corner of 3rd Street S. and DeMers Avenue.

In 2006, city leaders and developers announced plans to convert older office buildings into high-end condos and apartments, and to construct new buildings for the same purpose to provide for residents downtown. Directly south of downtown, the streets of the Near Southside Historic District are lined with classic houses. Reeves Drive was once one of the city&#x27;s most fashionable neighborhoods. It has many historic mansions exhibiting several unique architectural styles. This neighborhood has areas of original granitoid paving, several historic churches, and Lincoln Drive Park. The Near Southside neighborhood has been designated as a &quot;national historic district&quot; and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The newer neighborhoods of Grand Forks developed in the city&#x27;s southern and western parts. The 32nd Avenue South corridor has been the commercial center of the city since 1978, when the Columbia Mall opened. Many big box stores and restaurants are now along the avenue. A large strip mall, called the Grand Forks Marketplace, opened in 2001 near the Columbia Mall.

University Village is a new commercial district built on vacant lands owned by the University of North Dakota. The centerpiece of the Village is the Ralph Engelstad Arena, used by the university&#x27;s North Dakota men&#x27;s ice hockey team. All the buildings in the village have been built in a style similar style to those on the nearby UND campus. Restaurants and retail stores, as well as the university bookstore, were developed in the area to stimulate community life. In 2006, the university opened a new wellness center for its students on the village&#x27;s west side.

===Climate===
Due to its location in the Great Plains and its distance from both mountains and oceans, Grand Forks has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;), USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 4a. It has four very distinct seasons and great variation in temperatures over very short periods of time. Its location in the flat Red River Valley makes the city susceptible to spring flooding from the Red River of the North, and year-round windy conditions.

As there are no nearby mountain ranges or bodies of water to ameliorate the climatic conditions, Grand Forks lies exposed to numerous weather systems, including bitterly cold Arctic high pressure systems. The city has long, very cold, and snowy winters. Summers are often warm to hot and often quite humid with frequent thunderstorms. Although warm weather normally ends soon after Labor Day, a few warm days sometimes occur as late as October. Spring and autumn are short and highly variable seasons. Record temperature extremes range from on January 11, 1912, to on July 12, 1936.

The daily mean temperatures of the Grand Forks winters are associated with subarctic climates with frequent subzero temperatures. Due to the extended warm period of daily means above from May to September, the city&#x27;s climate is still classified within the warm-summer humid continental temperature range. Although its summers are warm, Grand Forks has experienced subfreezing temperatures in all 12 months.

==Economy==
The economy of Grand Forks is not dominated by any one industry or sector. While agriculture continues to play a role in the area&#x27;s economy, the city of Grand Forks now has a relatively diverse economy that includes public and private employers in sectors such as education, defense, health care, manufacturing, and food processing. The state and federal governments are two of the largest employers in the Grand Forks area. The University of North Dakota, in the heart of the city, is the largest employer in the metropolitan area. Grand Forks Air Force Base, just west of the city, employs a large number of civilian workers in addition to its military personnel. Altru Health System is the largest private employer in Grand Forks.

===Largest employers===
According to the city&#x27;s 2022 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the largest employers in the city are:

Major manufacturers in Grand Forks include wind turbine manufacturer LM Wind Fiber and light aircraft manufacturer Cirrus Design. Major food producers include potato processor J. R. Simplot Company and the state-owned North Dakota Mill and Elevator, the nation&#x27;s largest flour mill. SEI Information Technologies both operate call centers in Grand Forks. Other large private employers in the city include the locally owned Alerus Financial branch of banks, Home of Economy, and the locally owned Hugo&#x27;s chain of supermarkets.

The retail and service sector is also an important part of the economy. The historic center of shopping in Grand Forks was the downtown area. Today, downtown is home to small shops, bars, and restaurants. The south end of Grand Forks has become another major retail district, with three large shopping centers. The oldest, Grand Cities Mall, is on South Washington Street and contains small, locally owned stores and two churches. With about 70 stores, the city&#x27;s largest indoor mall is Columbia Mall. The newest major shopping center is the Grand Forks Marketplace power center mall, which features three big box retailers and several smaller stores. Due to its proximity to Canada, the Greater Grand Forks area attracts many shoppers from Manitoba.

===Economic development===
The city government is involved in the economic development process, helping firms grow and attracting new firms. A portion of sales tax revenues is set aside for this, some going into the Grand Forks Growth Fund. Companies can request low-interest loans or grants from this fund provided they meet certain criteria, such as paying a relatively high wage and doing most of their business outside the city&#x27;s trade region. The city also contributes to the Grand Forks Region Economic Development Corporation (EDC), a public-private organization that receives funding from banks and other major businesses. The EDC plays a consulting role for businesses, such as identifying suitable sites for expansion or assembling public funding packages. Its other key role is to vet businesses to see if they are suitable for funding by the Growth Fund.

Community leaders have long seen UND as an &quot;economic engine&quot; for the city. Besides its regular faculty, it also has business-like components such as the Energy and Environmental Research Center. UND hosts a technology incubator called the Center for Innovation. More recently, the university has been working to commercialize its research. A major thrust in that direction is the construction of a research park on the western fringes of the campus. Another potential economic opportunity for the city is the addition of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mission to Grand Forks Air Force Base.

==Culture==

===Arts and theatre===
Due at least in part to the presence of the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks offers a variety of arts and cultural events.

The Summer Performing Arts Company (SPA) is a popular summer arts program for area K–12 students. SPA stages three major musicals mid-July. The Myra Museum, on Belmont Road near the Greater Grand Forks Greenway, is a small history museum with exhibits that trace local history from the Ice Age, through settlement, and into the modern age. Other buildings on the Myra Museum grounds include the original 1868 Grand Forks Post Office, a 1917 one room school, and the historic Campbell House.

Grand Forks has a mayor-council government. The mayor, who is elected every four years, oversees the administration of city government and works directly with department heads to ensure the proper provision of services. The mayor of Grand Forks is former NHL hockey player and real estate developer Brandon Bochenski. Bochenski defeated Michael Brown in the June 9, 2020, mayoral election. Brown served as mayor from 2000 to 2020.

==Notable people==
==Sister cities==
Grand Forks sister cities:
*Dickinson, North Dakota, US
*Sarpsborg, Norway
*Awano, Tochigi, Japan (defunct)
*Ishim, Tyumen Oblast, Russia (inactive)

Grand Forks has an active sister city program designed to encourage cultural and economic exchanges. Its first sister city was Ishim in the Soviet Union. That relationship formally began in 1984 during the Cold War. Sometime in the late 1990s, political and economic turmoil in Russia ended the relationship. While the relationship with Ishim faded, Grand Forks found a new sister in Awano, Japan. An informal relationship began in 1994 when the school districts of both cities began exchanging students. In 1998, the two formally proclaimed themselves sister cities. The best publicly available testament to the relationship between the two is a Japanese rock garden in Grand Forks&#x27;s Sertoma Park and a sculpture of an American bison in an Awano park. The annexation of Awano by the larger city of Kanuma led to the end of the sister city relationship, but Kanuma and Grand Forks continue to partner in a yearly educational exchange of high school students. Grand Forks&#x27;s relationship with Dickinson, North Dakota, began in 2002, when delegations from each city visited the other. Grand Forks Mayor Michael Brown said he thought having friends in western North Dakota, which typically has diverging interests from eastern cities, could help at the state legislature. Sarpsborg, Norway, became a sister city in 2005 after several exchanges among leaders from both cities. The city became interested in building a relationship with Sarpsborg because many Grand Forks residents have Norwegian heritage.

<doc id="128552" wikidata="Q2577056" url="?curid=128552" title="Grand Forks Air Force Base">
<text>Grand Forks Air Force Base (AFB) is a United States Air Force installation in northeastern North Dakota, located north of Emerado and west of Grand Forks.

The host unit is the 319th Reconnaissance Wing (319 RW) assigned to the Air Combat Command (ACC) operating E/RQ-4B Global Hawk remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), in the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) role. During the Cold War, GFAFB was a major installation of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), with B-52 bombers, KC-135 tankers, and Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles.

==History==
Grand Forks Air Force Base was established on 1 December 1955, with construction beginning in the fall of that year. It was occupied for use on 28 January 1957, and was named after the neighboring city of Grand Forks.

===Air Defense Command===
Due to the continuance of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, GFAFB was originally an Air Defense Command (ADC) fighter-interceptor air base. The site was chosen in 1954 and the land was paid for by the citizens of Grand Forks, the site was located west of the city. The beginning of the air base started in 1956 with the construction of a runway.

On 18 February 1957, the 478th Fighter Group (Defense) was activated at Grand Forks. The 18th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was moved from Wurtsmith AFB, Michigan on 1 May 1960, and flew the F-101B Voodoo until 15 April 1971, when it was inactivated and the Voodoos were retired. It was replaced by the 460th FIS, moved from Kingsley Field at Klamath Falls, Oregon. The 460th FIS flew F-106 Delta Darts until it also was inactivated on 15 July 1974.

In addition to the interceptor squadrons, a Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Data Center (DC-11) was established at Grand Forks in 1958. The SAGE system was a network linking Air Force (and later FAA) General Surveillance Radar stations into a centralized center for Air Defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack. DC-11 was operated by the Grand Forks Air Defense Sector (GFADS), activated on 8 December 1957 under the 31st Air Division at Snelling AFS, Minnesota. On 1 January 1959, GFADS was transferred to the operational control of the 29th Air Division at Malmstrom AFB at Great Falls, Montana.

SAGE operations were extremely expansive and GFADS was inactivated on 1 December 1963, when it was merged with the Minot Air Defense Sector at Minot AFB to the west. With the inactivation of DC-11, Grand Forks AFB was reassigned from the Air Defense mission to Strategic Air Command (SAC).

In 1971, the 18th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was inactivated and the 460th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron replaced the unit. Although the 460th FIS won first place at the William Tell air-to-air competition at Tyndall AFB, Florida, it was inactivated in 1974 due to the restructuring of the air defense system, and ended the activities of ADCOM at Grand Forks.

The DC-11 SAGE blockhouse was later the headquarters of the SAC 321st Strategic Missile Wing. Following the end of Minuteman III missile operations in 1998, the large SAGE blockhouse was torn down five years later, in June 2003.

===Safeguard Anti-Ballistic Missile===
On 3 November 1967, the Department of Defense revealed that GFAFB was one of 10 initial locations to host a Sentinel Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) site. With president Richard Nixon&#x27;s announcement of 14 March 1969, constructing a &quot;Safeguard&quot; installation at Grand Forks became a top priority. Construction was stalled throughout mid-1969, as Congress debated the merits of BMD. After the Senate defeated amendments to kill Safeguard deployment, the U.S. Army proceeded under the assumption that appropriations would be forthcoming.

Survey teams selected sites in flat wheatlands close to the Canada-Minnesota border, north-northwest of Grand Forks. separated the Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR) and the Missile Site Radar (MSR) sites. Four remote launch sites of each were to be situated in a circle with a radius surrounding the MSR. Groundbreaking occurred at the PAR and MSR sites on 6 April 1970. Excavation proceeded rapidly, and the foundation holes for the PAR and MSR were in place by mid-May.

On 26 May 1972, President Nixon and Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev signed the ABM Treaty, which limited each nation to one site to protect strategic forces and one site to protect the &quot;National Command Authority.&quot; With work about 85% complete at Grand Forks, the US chose to finish construction at the North Dakota site. On 21 August 1972, the Army Corps of Engineers turned over the PAR to the Safeguard Systems Command (SAFSCOM) Site Activation Team. The transfer of the MSR occurred on 3 January 1973. Work on the four remote launch sites fell behind schedule, with the last completed on 5 November 1972. Testing of the PAR commenced during the summer of 1973.

On 3 September 1974, the SAFSCOM Site Activation Team was relieved by the U.S. Army Safeguard Command. Named the &quot;Stanley R. Mickelsen Safeguard Complex&quot; ( northwest of the base), the North Dakota ABM site received its complement of nuclear-tipped LIM-49 Spartan and Sprint Missiles during the following spring. The site was declared operational on 1 April 1975. Due to Congressional action, the Army operated the site for less than a year. With the exception of the PAR, the complex was abandoned in February 1976.

In October 1977, the PAR came under operational control of the USAF, which operated it as part of its early warning system. It was designated as Cavalier AFS ( north-northwest of the base), and remains active. It is operated by the Air Force Space Command 10th Space Warning Squadron (10th SWS).

===Strategic Air Command===

On 1 September 1958, the Strategic Air Command (SAC) established the 4133d Strategic Wing at Grand Forks as part of its plan to disperse its B-52 heavy bombers over a larger number of bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike. Many of these bases were near the U.S. border with Canada; those close to GFAFB in the north central U.S. were Minot and Glasgow to the west, and three in Michigan to the east (Sawyer, Kinchloe, and Wurtsmith).

The 4133d SW was redesignated as the 319th Bombardment Wing (319th BW) on 1 February 1963 in a name-only redesignation and was assigned to SAC&#x27;s Second Air Force, 810th Strategic Aerospace Division. Upon redesignation, the wing placed aircraft on peacetime quick reaction alert duty, and conducted global bombardment training for Emergency War Order operations and air refueling operations to meet SAC commitments. The aircraft in the 1960s at GFAFB were the latest models: B-52H bombers and KC-135A tankers.

In 1973, the 319th Bomb Wing acquired the AGM-69 Short Range Attack Missile (SRAM), replacing the older AGM-28 Hound Dog air-to-ground missile aboard its B-52H aircraft. As the activities in Southeast Asia decreased, the 319th BW focused its full efforts on training crews to fly strategic strike missions.

On 1 November 1964, 321st Strategic Missile Wing was organized as the Minuteman II intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) wing at GFAFB, the first in SAC.

During 1965, the wing&#x27;s three missile squadrons were activated and crew training and certification began at Vandenberg AFB in southern California. In August 1965, the base received its first Minuteman II missile, shipped by train from Assembly Plant 77 at Hill AFB at Ogden, Utah. During the following March, the base received the first Minuteman II to be shipped via aircraft, an Air Force first. The Minuteman III replaced the former in the 1970s.

The 319th transitioned from B-52H to B-52G aircraft in 1983 adding the AGM-86 Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) in 1984. In December 1986, the last B-52G permanently departed GFAFB, replaced by the B-1B Lancer in 1987. The tanker aircraft were also changed, from KC-135A to KC-135R. A change in the host unit occurred again in 1988, when the 42d Air Division was assigned for base support in place of the 321st SMW.

====Cold War aircraft incidents====
*On 2 November 1967, a Grand Forks B-52H (61-0030) crashed near Griffiss AFB in central New York, killing six of the eight aboard. It had engine difficulties and was attempting an emergency landing.
*On 15 September 1980, a B-52H on alert status experienced a wing fire that burned for three hours, fanned by evening winds of . The wind direction was parallel to the fuselage, which likely had SRAMs in the main bay. Eight years later, a weapons expert testified to a closed U.S. Senate hearing that a change of wind direction could have led to a conventional explosion and a widespread scattering of radioactive plutonium.
* Mid-morning on 27 January 1983, a B-52G (57-6507) exploded on the maintenance ramp, killing five maintenance personnel and injuring eight. A faulty fuel pump in a wing tank was being attended to prior to the accident.

===The 1990s===
With the restructuring of the Air Force and the disestablishment of SAC in 1992, the wing transferred to Air Combat Command (ACC), then came under Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) in 1993.

On 1 February 1993, ACC dropped the 319th Bomb Wing&#x27;s primary nuclear mission and gave the wing the primary mission of B-1B conventional bombardment operations. The 319th BW began planning and training to support such a mission to counter worldwide regional threats.

Following the departure of the last B-1B aircraft in 1994, the base transferred to the new Air Mobility Command (AMC) and the 319th Bomb Wing was redesignated as the 319th Air Refueling Wing (319 ARW). The KC-135R aircraft assets were transferred to AMC, and the strategic ICBM assets went to Air Force Space Command (AFSPC).

In March 1995, the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) selected the 321st Strategic Missile Wing for inactivation; it was first downgraded to group status, then inactivated on 30 September 1998. GFAFB&#x27;s Minuteman ICBM silos were imploded in accordance with the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II), commencing in 1999 and completed in 2001. The Minuteman III missiles were transferred to Malmstrom AFB in at Great Falls, Montana, to replace retired Minuteman II models. Minuteman III ICBMs remain at three USAF bases: Malmstrom, Minot, and F.E. Warren at Cheyenne, Wyoming.

===Twenty-first century===
In May 2005, DoD&#x27;s 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended that Grand Forks be realigned. The base&#x27;s KC-135 tanker mission was lost, with a significant reduction of personnel, but it was not closed.

The unmanned RQ-4 Global Hawk was assigned to Grand Forks, and on 1 March 2011, the wing was redesignated as the 319th Air Base Wing (319 ABW). The first RQ-4 arrived in May 2011 and were assigned to the 69th Reconnaissance Group, Air Combat Command. Starting in 2012, the base received several new Block 40 Global Hawks. On 13 June 2017, the 319 ABW transferred from the Air Mobility Command to the Air Combat Command.

On 11 May 2019 Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson announced that the 319th Air Base Wing would be re-designated the 319th Reconnaissance Wing in a ceremony on 28 June 2019.

On 28 June 2019 the 319th Air Base Wing was re-designated the 319th Reconnaissance Wing and the 69th Reconnaissance Group inactivated transferring the RQ-4 mission.

==Business and Culture==

Unlike many of small towns in North Dakota, Larimore has maintained a relatively stable population for the last forty years. Its close proximity to employment opportunities in Grand Forks and at the Grand Forks Air Force Base have cause many commuters to take up residence.

In the rural areas surrounding Larimore, population density is higher east of the town than west. Once mostly populated by yeoman farmers, many of these homestead farms are now horse ranches, hobby farms, or homesteads without notable agrarian use.

Although Larimore&#x27;s residential population is largely unchanged, commercial business declined through the final decades of the 20th century. Downturns in the farm economy and increased shopping options in larger, nearby cities such as Grand Forks led to many business closures in Larimore. The business district has since &quot;bottomed out&quot; and many of the once abandoned buildings have either been renovated for other uses or demolished and replaced with new structures. Abandoned lots and empty, deteriorating buildings still dot much of the downtown area of Larimore.

==Education==
It is within the Larimore Public School District 44.

==Transportation==
Amtrak’s Empire Builder, which operates between Seattle/Portland and Chicago, passes through the town on BNSF tracks, but makes no stop. The nearest station is located in Grand Forks, to the east.

==Notable people==
* Truck Hannah, was a Major League Baseball catcher for the New York Yankees, born in Larimore in 1889
* Clint Hill, United States Secret Service agent who was in the presidential motorcade during the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Hill was born in Larimore in 1932
* LeRoy Mason, was a movie actor, born in Larimore in 1903
* Eli C. D. Shortridge, third Governor of North Dakota from 1893 to 1895, was a resident of Larimore

==Climate==

==History==
Elgin was platted in 1910 when the railroad was extended to that point. The town was originally known as Shanley, but when the Northern Pacific Railroad came through town, they objected to the name as it was too similar to Stanley (the seat of Mountrail County), so the citizens were asked to choose a new name. At one point, one committee member checked the time on his Elgin pocket watch and suggested the brand name, which was found to be acceptable. A post office has been in operation at Elgin since 1910.

On July 4, 1978 an F4 tornado struck Elgin, causing five deaths and 35 injuries. The ninth deadliest storm in North Dakota&#x27;s recorded history, and the deadliest Independence Day tornado nationwide, Elgin&#x27;s Independence Day Tornado crumpled the town&#x27;s water tower.

<text>Leith ( ) is a city in Grant County, North Dakota, United States. The population was 28 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Leith was founded in 1910 along a Milwaukee Road branch line that separated from the railroad&#x27;s Pacific Extension in McLaughlin, South Dakota, and ran to New England, North Dakota. The name was given by railroad officials and comes from the harbor town of Leith near Edinburgh, Scotland. This line was abandoned in 1984, isolating Leith, as none of the primary highways in the area were constructed to go through the city.

===Neo-Nazis===

In 2011, a white supremacist named Craig Cobb began buying land in Leith, owning at least 12 plots of land by September 2013. Cobb wanted to move in other white supremacists so he could gain an electoral majority, take over the city government, and transform Leith into a neo-Nazi stronghold. This initiative was strongly supported by the National Socialist Movement (NSM), which was considered at the time to be the largest and most prominent neo-Nazi organization in the United States, but was heavily opposed by locals. Some locals advocated disincorporating the town to prevent Cobb&#x27;s takeover. On September 22, 2013, an anti-racist protest was held in Leith. The protest drew hundreds of participants, mostly Native Americans from nearby reservations, and was held in protest of Cobb&#x27;s actions and an NSM meeting in Leith scheduled for the same day. In November 2013, Cobb and one of his followers were arrested after confronting another resident with a shotgun and a rifle.

In February 2014, Cobb accepted a plea bargain and was sentenced to four years of supervised probation. He was fitted with an ankle monitor and banned from returning to Leith. Today, Cobb no longer owns any buildings in Leith. He deeded six properties back to the town at no charge and sold off a few others. Three were still owned by other white supremacists, but they showed little inclination to take up where Cobb left off.

After two men suspected of ties to Cobb were elected to the city council in June 2018, mayor Ryan Schock circulated a petition to disincorporate Leith. The Grant County commission subsequently cleared the way for a referendum on July 23, 2018 on dissolving the city. However, due to concerns that the original date was earlier than Century Code (state statutes) permitted, the vote was moved to November 6, the day of the 2018 midterm elections. As of July 2024, the city of Leith was still listed on the website of Grant County.

<text>Cooperstown is a city in Griggs County, North Dakota, United States. It is the county seat of Griggs County. The population was 983 at the 2020 census. Cooperstown was founded in 1882.

==History==
The city is named for R. C. Cooper, a bonanza farmer who built the first wood-frame house in the area in 1880. Prior to Cooper&#x27;s arrival, most settlers or the era lived in sod houses, covered wagons, tents, or log cabins (especially near the Sheyenne River where trees were numerous). Cooperstown was laid out on October 26, 1882, soon before the railroad was extended to that point.

On November 7, 1882, the Griggs County Board of Commissioners voted to locate the county seat on one of Cooper&#x27;s properties in Cooperstown. Prior to this, the county records were housed in Hope, North Dakota. The residents of Hope were determined that the county seat be located in their town and refused to surrender the records to Cooperstown. The County Commissioners forcibly removed the records by their next meeting on November 18.

<text>New England is a city in Hettinger County, North Dakota, United States. The population was 683 at the 2020 census.

New England was founded in 1887, predating all other settlements in Hettinger County by many years. The name recognizes that many early settlers were from the New England states of Vermont and Massachusetts. Until the tracks were abandoned in 1983, the city was located at the terminus of a Milwaukee Road branch line that split from the railroad&#x27;s Pacific Extension in McLaughlin, South Dakota.

The silhouette of the two Rainy Buttes near New England is a distinguishing symbol of the town.

===Climate===
New England has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;)/cool semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;), characterised by very warm summers with moderate rainfall mostly from thunderstorms, and freezing, dry winters. The frequent occurrences of warm chinook winds in winter, however, means that New England holds the record for the warmest temperature recorded in North Dakota in December and is only below Fort Yates’ record for the state’s warmest February (and winter season) temperature.
