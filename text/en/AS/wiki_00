<text>Hope Township is a township in Warren County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 1,835, a decrease of 117 (−6.0%) from the 2010 census count of 1,952, which in turn reflected an increase of 61 (+3.2%) from the 1,891 counted in the 2000 census. The 2010 population of 1,952 reflected an all-time high since the 1,903 recorded in the 1840 census, the first recorded population after the township was formed.

Hope Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 8, 1839, from portions of Knowlton Township and Oxford Township, based on the results of a referendum held that day. Liberty Township was created on March 25, 1926, from portions of the township.

==History==

Hope Township is one of the earliest planned communities in the United States, having been established by German Moravians in 1769. Early planning maps detail planned locations of streets, homes, wells, businesses, farms, a school, tavern, and church.

Prior to the arrival of the Moravians, there was no distinct town, but several families farmed on Jenny Jump Mountain, to the south of Hope, in surrounding area and on John Samuel Green Jr.&#x27;s farm in the center of what is now the Village. Throughout the 1760s, Moravians from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania traveled through this area on their way to New England to establish new communities. They lodged overnight with the Green Family who were impressed with their religion and way of life.

The Moravians were a religious group whose formal name was the &quot;Unitas Fratrum&quot; or Unity of the Brethren. They were followers of Jan Hus, the reformer from Prague who protested against the Roman Catholic Church in 1415 and was finally burned at the stake for his rebellion. These followers continued to practice his views in Moravia and Bohemia in what is now the Czech Republic, hence the common name &quot;The Moravians&quot;. In the late 17th century this group began to be persecuted and sought shelter away from Bohemia. Count Nicolas Ludwig von Zinzendorf offered them refuge on his lands east of Dresden, Germany, and provided a base for them to regroup and pursue their religion. That settlement which remains as the center of the worldwide Moravian religion is called Herrnhut or &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Watch&quot; inhabitants were not only &quot;under the Lord&#x27;s watchful care&quot; but were also to be &quot;on watch for the Lord&quot;. With the support of Count von Zinzendorf, the Church established over 200 missionary settlements.

After a formal survey of the village completed on November 26, 1774, the community was officially accepted by The Moravian Church and the name was changed by drawing lots on February 8, 1775, from Greenland to Hope. The name derives from the &quot;hope of immortality&quot; of the early Moravian settlers.

After almost 40 years of the Moravian &quot;experiment&quot; in Hope, the community was sold and almost all of the Moravians returned to Bethlehem or Nazareth, Pennsylvania. The basic reason for closing the community was that it was never self-supporting and had declined from its height of population of 147 to under 100 people by the early 19th century. The Church in Germany could no longer subsidize such a small village. Moravians worldwide were selling possessions and even some other entire communities to pay off debts incurred years earlier by Count von Zinzendorf, who heavily mortgaged his lands to give them opportunity back in Germany. Disease and a competitive gristmill also contributed to Moravian Hope&#x27;s decline.

<text>Independence Township is a township in Warren County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 5,469, a decrease of 193 (−3.4%) from the 2010 census count of 5,662, which in turn reflected an increase of 59 (+1.1%) from the 5,603 counted in the 2000 census.

== History ==
Independence Township was originally created on November 11, 1782, from Hardwick Township, while the area was still part of Sussex County, and was incorporated as one of the state&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. Most of Independence Township became part of the newly created Warren County on November 20, 1824, with the remainder becoming part of Green Township in Sussex County. Portions of the township were taken to form Hackettstown (March 9, 1853) and Allamuchy Township (April 4, 1873). The township was named for American independence.

Through the Township the major brooks and the Great Meadows drain into the Pequest River which winds slowly from northeast to southwest to flow on through the county and eventually into the Delaware River at Belvidere. Part of the eastern land drains under the Morris Canal bed and south into the Musconetcong River just below the boundary with Mansfield Township. The hillsides are steep, layered with rock and limestone while the valleys still hold soil deposited here from the receding glaciers. Mastodon bones and a few relics of the early Indian dwellers still occasionally can be found as well as coveys of game birds, some white tail deer and small game.

This area was initially settled and cleared as farmland for growing hay and grain or as pastureland. Timber was cut for lumber, grain was milled into flour, and some iron ore was mined from the Jenny Jump Mountain area during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. The mining of iron ore which attracted the early settlers, the later iron foundries, and many of the early industries have disappeared as has the Morris Canal and the railroads as the major means of shipping freight. After many attempts the Great Meadow was drained with the water channeled to permit successful development of commercial vegetable production. Shipping over the years has been by wagon, small trucks, rail freight, and then by large trailer trucks.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 19.98 square miles (51.75 km2), including 19.83 square miles (51.36 km2) of land and 0.15 square miles (0.39 km2) of water (0.76%).

Knowlton Township was created as a precinct by Royal charter from portions of Oxford Township on February 23, 1763, while the area was still part of Sussex County, and was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798, and then became part of the newly created Warren County on November 20, 1824. Portions of the township were taken to form Hope Township (April 8, 1839) and Blairstown Township (April 14, 1845).

Knowlton&#x27;s name is variously attributed to Thomas Knowlton, a Colonel in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War who was killed in action at the Battle of Harlem Heights, or to the knolls that characterize the area. In some older sources, the name is spelled &quot;Knawltown&quot;.

The township is served by postal ZIP Codes in Columbia (07832) and Delaware (07833), although a small number of Knowlton residents receive postal deliveries via the Blairstown (07825) post office.

===Rail history===
Much of Knowlton&#x27;s development after 1850 can be traced to the presence of the five railroad lines that criss-crossed the township: the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad&#x27;s Old Road and, later, the Lackawanna Cut-Off, the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway, the Lehigh and New England Railroad, and the Blairstown Railway. All of these rail lines were later abandoned. In their heyday, however, two rail lines and three railroads served the town of Delaware: the New York, Susquehanna and Western (formerly Blairstown) Railway; and the Old Road of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (which also had granted trackage rights to the Pennsylvania Railroad, technically a sixth railroad). The community of Columbia was also served by the NYS&amp;W (Hainesburg also had a station), with the Lehigh and New England Railroad also passing through town.

In more recent years, development within Knowlton has been tied to the presence of U.S. Route 46 and, since the early 1970s, Interstate 80. Many Knowlton residents use Route 80 to commute to their jobs either further east in New Jersey or further west in Pennsylvania. Route 94 crosses through the township. Two bridges cross the Delaware River, connecting the township to Pennsylvania; the Portland–Columbia Toll Bridge, opened in 1953, connects Route 94 to Pennsylvania Route 611 in Portland, Pennsylvania. The two places are also connected by the Portland–Columbia Pedestrian Bridge, which dates back to a structure constructed in 1869 and was dedicated for pedestrian use when the vehicular toll bridge was completed in 1953.

==Government==
===Local government===
Lopatcong Township is governed by the Small Municipality form of government, which is available under the terms of the Faulkner Act only for those municipalities with a population below 12,000 at the time of adoption. The township is one of 18 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the four-member Township Council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a three-year term of office. Council members are elected to serve a term of three years on a staggered basis, so that two seats come up for election in the two years that the mayor is not up for election.

, members of the Lopatcong Township Council are Mayor James Mengucci (R, term on committee and as mayor ends December 31, 2020), Council President William D. Wright (R, 2022), Louis Belcaro (R, 2024), Richard McQuade (R, 2024) and James Palitto (R, 2022).

In June 2016, the Township Council unanimously selected Yvonne Reitemeyer from a list of three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2016 that became vacant following the resignation of Donna Schneider.

In the November 2012 general election, Lori Ciesla, who ran as part of the independent slate of Responsible Lopatcong Leadership, won election, as did Maureen McCabe who won an unexpired one-year term when she defeated Republican incumbent Andrew Horun who had been appointed earlier in the year to fill the vacant seat of H.

<doc id="125819" wikidata="Q260026" url="?curid=125819" title="Nancy Mitford">
<text>Nancy Freeman-Mitford (28 November 1904 – 30 June 1973) was an English novelist, biographer, and journalist. The eldest of the Mitford sisters, she was regarded as one of the &quot;bright young things&quot; on the London social scene in the inter-war period. She wrote several novels about upper-class life in England and France, and is considered a sharp and often provocative wit. She also has a reputation as a writer of popular historical biographies.

Mitford enjoyed a privileged childhood as the eldest daughter of David Freeman-Mitford, later 2nd Baron Redesdale. Educated privately, she had no training as a writer before publishing her first novel in 1931. This early effort and the three that followed it created little stir. Her two semi-autobiographical post-war novels, &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot; (1945) and &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot; (1949), established her reputation.

Mitford&#x27;s marriage to Peter Rodd (1933) proved unsatisfactory to both, and they divorced in 1957 after a lengthy separation. During the Second World War she formed a liaison with a Free French officer, Gaston Palewski, who was the love of her life. After the war, Mitford settled in France and lived there until her death, maintaining contact with her many English friends through letters and regular visits.

During the 1950s, Mitford developed the concept of &quot;U&quot; (upper) and &quot;non-U&quot; language, whereby social origins and standing were identified by words used in everyday speech. She had intended this as a joke, but many took it seriously, and Mitford was considered an authority on manners and breeding.

Her later years were bittersweet, as the success of her biographical studies of Madame de Pompadour, Voltaire and King Louis XIV contrasted with the ultimate failure of her relationship with Palewski. From the late 1960s onward, her health deteriorated, and she endured several years of painful illness before her death in 1973.

==Family==

The Mitford family dates from the Norman era, when Sir John de Mitford held the Castle of Mitford in Northumberland. A later Sir John held several important public offices during the late 14th and early 15th centuries, and the family maintained a tradition of public service for many generations. In the 18th century William Mitford was a leading classical historian, responsible for the definitive history of ancient Greece. His great-grandson (Algernon) Bertram Mitford, born in 1837 and known as &quot;Bertie&quot;, was a diplomat and traveller who held minor office in Disraeli&#x27;s second ministry, from 1874 to 1880. 

In 1874, he married Clementina, the second daughter of David Ogilvy, 10th Earl of Airlie, a union that linked the Mitfords to some of Britain&#x27;s most prominent aristocratic families. Blanche Ogilvy, Clementina&#x27;s elder sister, became the wife of Sir Henry Montague Hozier, a soldier turned businessman. Their four children included daughters Clementine (&quot;Clemmie&quot;), who in 1908 married the future British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Nellie, who married Bertram Romilly.

Both Hozier and Blanche were promiscuous, and it is generally accepted by historians and family members that Hozier was not Clemmie&#x27;s father although he was registered as such. Blanche told her friend Lady Londonderry, shortly before Clemmie&#x27;s birth, that the father of the expected child was her own brother-in-law, Bertie Mitford. Most historians believe that other candidates for the paternity are more likely.

Bertie Mitford&#x27;s marriage produced five sons and four daughters. His career in government service ended in 1886 when, after the death of a cousin, he inherited a considerable fortune. A condition of the inheritance was that he adopt the surname &quot;Freeman-Mitford&quot;. He rebuilt Batsford House in Gloucestershire, the family&#x27;s country seat, served briefly as a Unionist MP in the 1890s and otherwise devoted himself to books, writings and travel. In 1902, he was raised to the peerage as 1st Baron Redesdale, a re-creation of a title that had previously been held in the family but had lapsed in 1886.

===Selective Mitford family tree===

==Childhood==
===Parentage===
Nancy Mitford&#x27;s father, David Bertram Ogilvy Freeman-Mitford, was Bertie Mitford&#x27;s second son, born on 13 March 1878. After several years as a tea planter in Ceylon he fought in the Boer War of 1899–1902 and was severely wounded. In 1903 he became engaged to Sydney Bowles, the elder daughter of Thomas Gibson Bowles, known as &quot;Tap&quot;, a journalist, editor and magazine proprietor whose publications included &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;The Lady&quot;. The couple were married on 16 February 1904, after which they rented a house in Graham Street in West London. Bowles provided his son-in-law with a job, as business manager of &quot;The Lady&quot; magazine. David had little interest in reading and knew nothing of business; thus, according to Nancy Mitford&#x27;s biographer Selina Hastings, &quot;a less congenial post ... could hardly have been imagined&quot;. He remained in this position for 10 years. The couple&#x27;s first child, a daughter, was born on 28 November 1904; they had intended to call her Ruby, but after she was born they changed their minds and named her Nancy.

===First years===
Responsibility for Nancy Mitford&#x27;s day-to-day upbringing was delegated to her nanny and nursemaid, within the framework of Sydney&#x27;s short-lived belief that children should never be corrected or be spoken to in anger. Before this experiment was discontinued, the young Nancy Mitford had become self-centred and uncontrollable; Hastings writes that her first years were &quot;characterised by roaring, red-faced rages&quot;. Just before her third birthday, a sister, Pamela, was born; the nanny&#x27;s apparent change of loyalty in favour of the new arrival was a further source of outrage to Mitford, and throughout their childhood and into young adulthood she continued to vent her displeasure on her sister.

In January 1909 a brother, Tom was born, and in June 1910 another sister, Diana, followed. That summer, to relieve the pressure on what was becoming an overcrowded nursery, Nancy Mitford attended the nearby Francis Holland School. The few months she spent there represented almost the whole of her formal schooling; in the autumn the family moved to a larger house in Victoria Road, Kensington, after which Nancy was educated at home by successive governesses. Summers were spent at the family&#x27;s cottage near High Wycombe, in Buckinghamshire, or with the children&#x27;s Redesdale grandparents at Batsford Park. In the winter of 1913–14 David and Sydney visited Canada, prospecting for gold on a claim that David had purchased in Swastika, Ontario. It was here that their fifth child was conceived, a daughter born in London on 8 August 1914 and christened Unity.

===War, Batsford Park and Asthall Manor===
On the outbreak of the First World War on 4 August 1914, David re-joined his regiment and was soon in France. In May 1915, Clement, David&#x27;s older brother, was killed while serving with the 10th Royal Hussars, which made David heir to the Redesdale title and lands. On 17 August 1916 Bertie Mitford died; David, still serving at the front, became the 2nd Baron Redesdale. Sydney quickly took possession of Batsford House, much of which had been shut up for many years, and occupied the portion of it that she could afford to heat. The children had the run of the house and grounds, and were taught together in the schoolroom. This was a source of frustration for Nancy, whose lively intelligence required greater stimulus. She spent many hours reading in the Batsford House library where, according to Hastings, the foundations of her intellectual life were laid.
The Redesdale estates were extensive, but uneconomical. At the end of the war Redesdale decided to sell Batsford Park and move his increasing family (a fifth daughter, Jessica, had been born in September 1917) to less extravagant accommodation. The house was sold early in 1919, together with much of its contents—including, to Nancy&#x27;s great dismay, a large part of its library. The new family home was Asthall Manor, a Jacobean mansion near Swinbrook in Oxfordshire. This was intended as a short-term measure while a new house was built on land nearby. The family stayed in Asthall Manor for seven years, and it became the basis of many of the family scenes which Nancy was later to portray in her semi-autobiographical novels.

Growing up proved a difficult process for Nancy. Unable to form a relationship with Pamela, the sister nearest to her in age, she was bored and irritated by her younger siblings, and vented her feelings by teasing and tormenting them. Although there was undoubtedly cruelty in her taunting—the other children, led by Tom, formed a &quot;Leag (sic) against Nancy&quot;—her teasing was also, according to the later reflections of her nephew Alexander Mosley: &quot;a highly-honed weapon to keep a lot of highly competitive, bright, energetic sisters in order. She used it ... as a form of self protection&quot;. Not all her interactions with her siblings were hostile; for their amusement she edited and produced a magazine, &quot;The Boiler&quot;, to which she contributed entertainingly gruesome murder stories.

In 1921, after years of pleading for proper schooling, Nancy was allowed a year&#x27;s boarding at Hatherop Castle, an informal private establishment for young ladies of good family. Laura Thompson, in her biography of Nancy, describes Hatherop as not so much a school, &quot;more a chaste foretaste of debutante life&quot;. Here Nancy learned French and other subjects, played organised games and joined a Girl Guide troop. It was her first extended experience of life away from home, and she enjoyed it. The following year she was allowed to accompany four other girls on a cultural trip to Paris, Florence and Venice; her letters home are full of expressions of wonder at the sights and treasures: &quot;I had no idea I was so fond of pictures ... if only I had a room of my own I would make it a regular picture gallery&quot;.

==Debutante and socialite==
Nancy&#x27;s eighteenth birthday in November 1922 was the occasion for a grand &quot;coming-out&quot; ball, which marked the beginning of her entry into Society. That was followed in June 1923 by her presentation at Court, a formal introduction to King George V at Buckingham Palace, after which she was officially &quot;out&quot; and could attend the balls and parties that constituted the London Season. She spent much of the next few years in a round of social events, making new friends and mixing with the &quot;Bright Young People&quot; of 1920s London. Nancy declared that &quot;we hardly saw the light of day, except at dawn&quot;. In 1926 Asthall Manor was finally sold. While the new house at Swinbrook was made ready, the female members of the family were sent for three months to Paris, a period which, says Hastings, began Nancy&#x27;s &quot;lifelong love affair&quot; with France.

Among Nancy&#x27;s new London friends was Evelyn Gardner who, Nancy informed her brother Tom, was engaged &quot;to a man called Evelyn Waugh who writes, I believe, very well&quot;. She and Waugh later developed a lasting friendship. Although she was now of age, her father maintained an aggressive hostility towards most of her male friends, particularly since, as Hastings remarks, these tended towards the frivolous, the aesthetic and the effeminate. Among them was Hamish St Clair Erskine, the second son of the 5th Earl of Rosslyn, an Oxford undergraduate four years Nancy&#x27;s junior. He was, according to Hastings, the least suitable partner of all, &quot;the most shimmering and narcissistic of all the beautiful butterflies&quot;—and the one most likely to offend Lord Redesdale. The pair met in 1928 and became unofficially engaged, despite his homosexuality, of which Nancy may not have been aware. Against a backdrop of hostility from family and friends—Waugh advised her to &quot;dress better and catch a better man&quot;—the engagement endured sporadically for several years.

==Incipient writer==
As a means of augmenting the meagre allowance provided by her father, Mitford began writing, encouraged by Waugh. Her first efforts, anonymous contributions to gossip columns in society magazines, led to occasional signed articles, and in 1930 &quot;The Lady&quot; engaged her to write a regular column. That winter, she embarked on a full-length novel, &quot;Highland Fling&quot;, in which various characters—mostly identifiable among her friends, acquaintances and family—attend a Scottish house-party which develops chaotically. 

The book made little impact when it was published in March 1931, and she immediately began work on another, &quot;Christmas Pudding&quot;, illustrated by her close friend Mark Ogilvie-Grant. Like the earlier novel, the plot centres on a clash between the &quot;Bright Young People&quot; and the older generation. Hamish Erskine is clearly identifiable in the character of &quot;Bobby Bobbin&quot;, and John Betjeman is the basis for the supporting role of Bobby&#x27;s tutor. The thinly disguised caricatures pervading the book shocked Lady Redesdale, who thought it could not possibly be published under Mitford&#x27;s own name.

The affair between Erskine and Mitford continued intermittently. While she often despaired of the relationship, she refused other offers of marriage, saying that she would &quot;never marry anyone except Hamish.&quot; In 1932 her plight was overshadowed by a family scandal involving her younger sister Diana, who had married Bryan Guinness in 1928 and was the mother of two young sons. In 1932 Diana deserted her husband to become the mistress of Sir Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British Union of Fascists, himself married with three children. Almost alone of her family, Mitford offered her sister support, regularly visiting her and keeping her up to date with family news and social gossip. Her own love affair with Erskine came to an abrupt end when, in June 1933, he informed her that he intended to marry the daughter of a London banker. In a final letter after their parting, Mitford wrote to him: &quot;I thought in your soul you loved me &amp; that in the end we should have children &amp; look back on life together when we are old&quot;.

==Marriage, writing and politics==
Within a month of Erskine&#x27;s departure, Mitford announced her engagement to Peter Rodd, the second son of Sir Rennell Rodd, a diplomat and politician who was ennobled that year as Baron Rennell. According to Mitford&#x27;s friend Harold Acton, Rodd was &quot;a young man of boundless promise ... he had abundant qualifications for success in any profession he deigned to choose&quot;. Other biographers describe him as irresponsible, unfaithful, a bore and unable to hold down a regular job, and as the model for Waugh&#x27;s unscrupulous, amoral character Basil Seal from &quot;Black Mischief&quot;. They were married on 4 December 1933, after which they settled into a cottage at Strand-on-the-Green on the western edges of London. Mitford&#x27;s initial delight in the marriage was soon tempered by financial worries, Rodd&#x27;s fecklessness and her dislike of his family.

In 1934, Mitford began her third novel, &quot;Wigs on the Green&quot;, a satire on Sir Oswald Mosley&#x27;s fascist &quot;Blackshirt&quot; movement. Mitford herself had briefly flirted with Mosley&#x27;s New Party in 1931, although her enthusiasm was short-lived, and she soon became a vociferous opponent of the British Union of Fascists and of fascism. When the novel was published in 1935, its book cover illustrated by Bip Pares, it made little critical impact and seriously offended members of her own family, particularly her sisters Diana and Unity, both of whom were supporters of Mosley&#x27;s movement and devotees of the German dictator Adolf Hitler. Diana eventually forgave Nancy, but Nancy&#x27;s rift with Unity, who was outraged by her depiction in the book as the ridiculous &quot;Eugenia Malmains&quot;, was never fully healed.

By 1936, Nancy Mitford&#x27;s marriage was largely a sham. Rodd was engaged in an affair with the wife of a friend, a situation that continued into the new year, when the Mitford family was further shaken by the 19-year-old Jessica&#x27;s elopement with her cousin Esmond Romilly. A rebellious ex-Wellington schoolboy and avowed Communist, Romilly fought on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. The young couple were traced to Bilbao, and Nancy was despatched to bring them home but failed to persuade them, and Jessica and Esmond were married in May 1937.

Through the winter of 1937–1938, Mitford&#x27;s main literary task was editing the letters of her cousins the Stanleys of Alderley, with whom she was connected through her great-grandmother Blanche Airlie. Her preoccupation with the project, nine or ten hours a day, she informed her friend Robert Byron, further damaged her relationship with Rodd, who resented the time thus spent. Nevertheless, in the summer of 1938, she discovered that she was pregnant. She hoped for a girl: &quot;2 Peter Rodds in 1 house is unthinkable&quot;, but in September, she miscarried. Early in 1939, Rodd left for southern France to work with the relief organisations assisting the thousands of Spanish refugees who had fled from General Franco&#x27;s armies in the final stages of the civil war. In May, Mitford joined him and spent several weeks there as a relief worker. She was much affected by what she saw: &quot;I have never cried so much in all my life&quot;. The experience hardened her antifascism to the extent that she wrote: &quot;I would join hands with the devil himself to stop any further extension of the disease&quot;.

Having rejected the political extremes within her family, Nancy Mitford was a moderate socialist, but some of her works, such as her introductions to the Stanley letter collections, and her &quot;U–non-U&quot; essay of 1955, are staunch defences of the aristocratic traditions and values that she grew up with.

==Second World War==
The outbreak of war in September 1939 divided the Mitford family. Nancy and Rodd supported the Allies in the war. The Romillys had by this time departed for America, but the others either hoped for an Anglo-German détente or, as with Unity, were openly pro-Nazi. Unity was in Munich when war was declared. In despair, she attempted suicide by shooting herself in the head. She survived, and was sent home through neutral Switzerland. Mosley and Diana, who had married secretly in 1936, were detained under Defence Regulation 18B. 

Nancy, in full antifascist mode, had described her sister to the British Intelligence agency MI5 as &quot;a ruthless and shrewd egotist, a devoted fascist and admirer of Hitler [who] sincerely desires the downfall of England and democracy in general&quot;. During the &quot;Phoney War&quot; of 1939–1940, Nancy was briefly an Air Raid Precautions (ARP) driver, and later worked shifts at a first-aid post in Paddington. She drew on those experiences in her fourth novel, &quot;Pigeon Pie&quot;, a comedy about spying. It was published by Hamish Hamilton in May 1940, while there was little public appetite for lighthearted war satire, and the book was a commercial failure.
In April 1940, Mitford suffered her second miscarriage. Shortly afterward, Rodd, who had been commissioned into the Welsh Guards, departed overseas. Alone in London, Mitford moved to the family&#x27;s Rutland Gate house where she remained during the London Blitz. The main house had been requisitioned to provide a refuge for Jewish families evacuated from the bombed areas of the East End. Mitford spent much of her time looking after those families: &quot;so hard-working, clean and grateful&quot;. 

A brief affair with a Free French officer, André Roy, resulted in a third pregnancy. Mitford again miscarried, with complications that led, in November 1941, to a hysterectomy. After convalescence, at loose ends, she began working as an assistant at the Heywood Hill bookshop in Curzon Street. The shop became the centre of Mitford&#x27;s daily activities and was a favoured meeting place for London&#x27;s literati. 

In September 1942, she met Gaston Palewski, a French colonel attached to General Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s London staff. She found him fascinating, and he became the love of her life though her feelings were never fully reciprocated. He was an inspiration for much of her future writing. For the sake of Mitford&#x27;s reputation, the affair was pursued with discretion before Palewski left for Algeria in May 1943. Thereafter, the relationship was conducted mainly by letters and occasional phone calls since Palewski was only intermittently in England before the end of the war.

The failure of &quot;Pigeon Pie&quot; had cooled Mitford&#x27;s desire to write, but in 1944, with Waugh&#x27;s encouragement, she began planning a new novel. In March 1945, she was given three months&#x27; leave from the shop to write it. &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot; is a heavily autobiographical romantic comedy in which many of her family and acquaintances appear in thin disguises. Despite the distraction of learning that her brother Tom had died fighting in Burma, she finished the book and, in September, went to Paris. Ostensibly, that was to establish a French branch of Heywood Hill, but in reality, she wished to be close to Palewski, who was now a member of de Gaulle&#x27;s postwar provisional government. 

In December 1945, she was back in London for the publication of &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot; which was, Hastings records, &quot;an instant and phenomenal success ... the perfect antidote to the long war years of hardship and austerity, providing the undernourished public with its favourite ingredients: love, childhood and the English upper classes&quot;. The book sold 200,000 copies within a year of publication, and firmly established Mitford as a best-selling author.

==Move to Paris==
At the end of the war, Rodd returned home, but the marriage was essentially over. Although remaining on friendly terms, the couple led separate lives. Mitford&#x27;s visit to France in late 1945 had revived her longing to be there, and in April 1946, having given up working in the shop the previous month, she left London to make her permanent home in Paris and never lived in England again. She was a prolific letter writer and kept contact with her large cohort of friends by a voluminous correspondence. According to Hastings, she developed many of her friendships far further on paper than she could have done through normal social intercourse.

===Rue Monsieur===

During her first 18 months in Paris, Mitford lived in several short-term lodgings while she enjoyed a hectic social life, the hub of which was the British Embassy under the regime of the ambassador, Duff Cooper, and his socialite wife, Lady Diana Cooper. Eventually Mitford found a comfortable apartment, with a maid, at No. 7 rue Monsieur on the Left Bank, close to Palewski&#x27;s residence. Settled there in comfort, she established a pattern to her life that she mostly followed for the next 20 years, her precise timetable being determined by Palewski&#x27;s varying availability. Her socialising, entertaining and working were interspersed with regular short visits to family and friends in England and summers generally spent in Venice.

In 1948, Mitford completed a new novel, a sequel to &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot; that she called &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot;, with the same country house ambience as the earlier book and many of the same characters. The novel&#x27;s reception was even warmer than that of its predecessor. Waugh was one of the few critics to qualify his praise; he thought that the descriptions were good but the conversations poor. In 1950 she translated and adapted André Roussin&#x27;s play &quot;La petite hutte&quot; (&#x27;The Little Hut&#x27;), in preparation for its successful West End début in August, &quot;The Times&quot;″s critic noted the &quot;habit of speech at once colloquial and unexpected which instantly declares itself the creation of Miss Mitford.&quot; The play ran for 1,261 performances, and provided Mitford with a steady £300 per month in royalties. The same year &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; asked her to contribute a regular column, which she did for four years. The busy period in her writing life continued in 1951 with her third postwar novel, &quot;The Blessing&quot;, another semi-autobiographical romance this time set in Paris, in which an aristocratic young Englishwoman is married to a libidinous French marquis. Harold Acton deems it her most accomplished novel, &quot;permeated with her joyous love of France&quot;. This time Waugh (to whom the book was dedicated) had no criticism; he found the book &quot;admirable, deliciously funny, consistent and complete, by far the best of your writings&quot;.

Mitford then began her first serious non-fiction work, a biography of Madame de Pompadour. The general view of the critics when the book was published in March 1954 was that it was &quot;marvelous entertainment, if hardly to be taken as history&quot;. The historian AJP Taylor likened Mitford&#x27;s evocation of 18th-century Versailles to &quot;Alconleigh&quot;, the fictitious country house that formed the background to her recent best-selling novels, a comparison that she found offensive.

===&quot;Noblesse Oblige&quot;===

In 1954 Alan Ross, a University of Birmingham professor of linguistics, devised the terms &quot;U&quot; and &quot;Non-U&quot; to differentiate the speech patterns of the social classes in England. &quot;U&quot; indicated upper-class usage, and &quot;Non-U&quot; the conventions of the lower strata of society. His article, in a learned Finnish journal and with an illustrative glossary, used &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot; to exemplify upper-class speech patterns. In a spirit of mischief, Mitford incorporated the U and Non-U thesis into an article she was writing for &quot;Encounter&quot; on the English aristocracy. Although the aspect formed only a small section of Mitford&#x27;s article, when it was published in September 1955 it caused a major stir. Few recognised the tongue-in-cheek aspect. Mitford received hundreds of letters from worried readers desperate to know if they were snobs or merely &quot;common&quot;. The level of anxious or amused interest was sustained to such an extent that in 1956 Hamish Hamilton reproduced the article in a short book, &quot;Noblesse Oblige&quot;. The book also included an abbreviated version of Ross&#x27;s original article, and contributions from Waugh, Betjeman, Peter Fleming and Christopher Sykes, It was a tremendous success; as Lovell records, &quot;&#x27;U and Non-U&#x27; was the buzz phrase of the day ... Nancy&#x27;s comments made her the arbiter of good manners for several generations&quot;. Thompson notes the irony that the U and Non-U labels, perhaps Mitford&#x27;s best-known legacy, were not her own but were borrowed for the purpose of a &quot;tease&quot;.

==Later career==
In October 1957 Palewski was appointed as France&#x27;s ambassador to Italy. Mitford&#x27;s meetings with him, which had become increasingly rare because of his many political and social commitments, were now reduced to a single visit a year, supplemented with occasional letters. Mitford mainly concealed her true feelings on this separation, although one acquaintance noted her increasingly &quot;savage&quot; teasing of friends, which was perhaps a safety valve: &quot;If she would only tell one she is unhappy one would do what one could to comfort her&quot;. In March 1958 Mitford&#x27;s father, Lord Redesdale, died. After the cremation, she informed her sister Jessica, &quot;the ashes were done up in the sort of parcel he used to bring back from London, rich thick brown paper &amp; incredibly neat knots&quot;.
Meanwhile Mitford had completed her latest book, &quot;Voltaire in Love&quot;, an account of the love affair between Voltaire and the Marquise du Châtelet. She considered it her first truly grown-up work, and her best. Published in 1957, it sold well, was taken seriously by the critics and was warmly praised by Mitford&#x27;s friends. Its writing had been hampered by painful headaches arising from her apparently failing eyesight and worries that she might be going blind. The problem was resolved after a visit to the ophthalmic surgeon Patrick Trevor-Roper, who gave her new spectacles: &quot;It is heavenly to be able to read for a long time on end &amp; now I see how handicapped I was when doing Voltaire&quot;. She then returned to writing fiction, with &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Alfred&quot;, in which she revived Fanny Wincham, the narrator of &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot; and &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot;, and placed her in a Paris setting as wife of the British ambassador. Several characters familiar from the earlier novels appear in minor roles. The book, published in October 1960, was popular with the public, but received indifferent reviews. Some of Mitford&#x27;s friends disliked it, and she decided she would write no more fiction.

In August 1962 Palewski was appointed a minister in Georges Pompidou&#x27;s government, and returned to Paris. This did not mean more regular or frequent meetings, and the affair with Mitford continued at arm&#x27;s length. In April 1963 Mitford was in England for the wedding of her cousin Angus Ogilvy to Princess Alexandra. A month later she was back for the funeral of her mother, Lady Redesdale, who died on 25 May. Mitford&#x27;s friends were dying, too, &quot;in middle age&quot;, she informed her long-time friend Violet Hammersley. The premature deaths included that of Evelyn Waugh, who died on 10 April 1966. Mitford saw the kindness and humour concealed behind his hostile public image, and said after his death: &quot;What nobody ever remembers about Evelyn is everything with him was jokes. Everything&quot;. Thompson calls their relationship &quot;one of the great literary friendships of the twentieth century&quot;.

Amidst these personal upheavals Mitford continued writing. In 1964 she began work on &quot;The Sun King&quot;, a biography of Louis XIV. Her publishers decided to issue it as a lavishly illustrated &quot;coffee table&quot; book. When it was published in August 1966, among the many tributes to the book was that of President de Gaulle, who recommended it to every member of his cabinet. By this time, Mitford&#x27;s relationship with Palewski had become dormant, and she recognised that the best days would never return. Under pressure from her landlords to leave her rue Monsieur apartment—they had raised her rent &quot;exorbitantly&quot;— she decided to leave Paris and buy herself a house in Versailles.

===Final years===

Mitford moved to No. 4 rue d&#x27;Artois, Versailles, in January 1967. The modest house had a half-acre (0.2 hectare) garden, which soon became one of her chief delights. In 1968 she began work on her final book, a biography of Frederick the Great. While confined at home in March 1969 after a series of illnesses she learned from a newspaper announcement that Palewski had married the Duchesse de Sagan, a rich divorcée. Mitford had long accepted that Palewski would never marry her. Nevertheless, she was deeply hurt by the news, although she affected a typical nonchalance. 

Shortly after, she entered hospital for the removal of a tumour. After the operation she continued to suffer pain, although she was able to continue working on her book. In October 1969 she undertook a tour of East Germany, to visit former royal palaces and battlefields. She finished the book, but in April 1970 was back in hospital for further tests, which did not lead to either a diagnosis or effective treatment.

&quot;Frederick the Great&quot; was published later in 1970 to a muted reception. Mitford&#x27;s remaining years were dominated by her illness, although for a time she enjoyed visits from her sisters and friends, and working in her garden. In April 1972 the French government made her a Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur, and later that year the British government appointed her a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). She was delighted by the former honour, and amused by the latter—which she remembered Waugh had called an &quot;insult&quot; and turned down. 

At the end of 1972 she entered the Nuffield Clinic in London, where she was diagnosed with Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, a cancer of the blood. She lived for another six months, unable to look after herself and in almost constant pain, struggling to keep her spirits up. She wrote to her friend James Lees-Milne: &quot;It&#x27;s very curious, dying, and would have many a drôle amusing &amp; charming side were it not for the pain&quot;. She died on 30 June 1973 at her home in the rue d&#x27;Artois and was cremated in Versailles, after which her ashes were taken to Swinbrook for burial alongside her sister Unity.

==Writings==

===Fiction===

Mitford had no training as a writer or journalist; her style, particularly in the pre-war novels, is chatty and informal, much as in her letters. She may have inherited some of her natural wit and sharpness of expression from her maternal grandfather Thomas Bowles, who in his youth during the Franco-Prussian War had provided dispatches which Acton describes as &quot;extremely graphic and amusing&quot;. Mitford&#x27;s fiction, based on upper-class family life and , belongs to the genre of the comedy of manners. Her protagonists—typically, intelligent women surrounded by eccentric characters determined to find life amusing—are broadly autobiographical. 

It is unsurprising, says Thompson, that Mitford first attempted to write a novel in the early 1930s, since many of her friends were doing the same thing. What is surprising, Thompson adds, is the ease with which she found a publisher for this first book. Perhaps, says Thompson, her publishers Thornton Butterworth &quot;liked the idea of this pretty, well-connected girl who wrote in the style &quot;du jour&quot;&quot;. Mitford was later embarrassed by her prewar novels; Rachel Cooke, writing on their reissue in 2011, believes she had no reason to be: &quot;There is a special kind of energy here, and its engine is the admirable and irresistible commitment of a writer who would rather die than be boring&quot;.

Critics generally place the postwar novels in a different league from the earlier efforts; Cooke describes &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot; as &quot;an immaculate novel that soars many miles above what came before&quot;. In Acton&#x27;s view it and its companion volume &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot; present an entirely authentic picture of country house life in England between the wars, and will long be consulted by historians of the period. In these later novels Zoë Heller of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; hears in the prose, behind a new level of care and artfulness, &quot;the unmistakeable Mitford trill, in whose light, bright cadences an entire hard-to-shock and easy-to-bore view of life is made manifest&quot;. At times a more serious undertone, contrasting with the &quot;bright, brittle, essentially ephemeral&quot; nature of her early works, becomes evident; Olivia Laing in the &quot;Guardian&quot;, discerns &quot;a faint and beguiling pessimism about love&#x27;s pursuit and its consequences&quot; beneath the light superficiality.

&quot;The Blessing&quot; has provoked a more divided response. Waugh&#x27;s judgement was that those who criticised the book were &quot;lazy brutes ... [who] ... can&#x27;t bear to see a writer grow up&quot;. More recently, Philip Hensher and others have argued that although the novel is immensely enjoyable and that Mitford&#x27;s &quot;marvellous voice&quot; is undiminished, she is on less sure ground with her &quot;Frenchness&quot; than with the English country house ambience, and her picture of France as the embodiment of everything civilised is less than convincing. Similar mixed comments greeted Mitford&#x27;s final novel, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Alfred&quot;, Waugh again hailing it as her best, &quot;clamouring for a sequel&quot;. 

In this judgement he was largely alone. Other critics perceived in the anecdotal framework of the book an uncertainty as to what it was about. An American reviewer wondered what parts were to be taken seriously: &quot;What exactly goes on? ... Can you always tell an Etonian, even when he goes beat? Is all modern architecture a fraud? Do U-people really talk this way?&quot; Similar questions were raised in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;″s review, in relation to Mitford&#x27;s fictional output as a whole: &quot;Would she have been a better novelist if she had &#x27;tried harder&#x27;, gone in further, dropped the pose of amateurishness, cut the charm, looked beyond the worlds that she knew and, more importantly, loved?&quot;

===Biographical works===
The gift for vivid characterisation, which Mitford developed in her fiction, was used to full effect in her four biographical works. In the first of these, &quot;Madame de Pompadour&quot;, she followed Waugh&#x27;s advice not to write for experts but to fashion &quot;a popular life like Strachey&#x27;s &quot;Queen Victoria&quot;&quot;, with &quot;plenty of period prettiness&quot;. This remained her yardstick in her subsequent biographical writings. Her own description of &quot;Voltaire in Love&quot; is &quot;a Kinsey report of his romps with Mme de Châtelet and her romps with Saint-Lambert and his romps with Mme de Boufflers ... I could go on for pages&quot;. Acton thought &quot;The Sun King&quot; the most entertaining introduction to the subject in the English language. Mitford&#x27;s informal style was remarked on by the literary critic Cyril Connolly, who wrote that her facility for transforming unpromising source material into readable form was a skill that any professional historian might envy. The historian Antonia Fraser considered Mitford an important contributor to the &quot;remorseless process by which historical and biographical sales have soared since 1950&quot;.

===Journalism, letters and other works===
Mitford did not regard herself as a journalist: nevertheless, her articles were popular, particularly those she contributed on Paris life to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. Thompson describes this series as &quot;a more sophisticated version of &quot;A Year in Provence&quot;, bringing France to the English in just the way that they most like it&quot;. Thompson adds that although Mitford was always a competent writer, it is in her letters, with their freedom of expression and flights of fancy, that her true character emerges. Many have been published within collections; they are, according to &quot;The Independent&quot;″s reviewer: &quot;a delight, full of the sparks of an abrasive and entertaining wit, refreshingly free from politeness&quot;.

<text>Jessica Lucy &quot;Decca&quot; Treuhaft (&quot;née&quot; Freeman-Mitford, later Romilly; 11 September 1917 – 23 July 1996) was an English author, one of the six aristocratic Mitford sisters noted for their sharply conflicting politics.

Jessica married her second cousin Esmond Romilly, who was killed in World War II, and then American civil rights lawyer Robert Treuhaft, with whom she joined the Communist Party USA and worked closely in the Civil Rights Congress. Both refused to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee. They resigned from the party in 1958.

Her 1960 memoir &quot;Hons and Rebels&quot; and her 1963 book of social commentary &quot;The American Way of Death&quot; both became classics.

==Early life and ancestry==
Born at Asthall Manor, Oxfordshire, the sixth of seven children, Jessica Mitford was the daughter of David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale, and his wife Sydney (daughter of politician and publisher Thomas Bowles). She grew up in a series of her father&#x27;s country houses. She had little formal education. Her sisters Unity and Diana were well-known Fascists.

Jessica (known as &quot;Decca&quot; to family and friends) later described her conservative father as &quot;one of nature&#x27;s fascists&quot;, renounced her privileged background while still a teenager, and became an adherent of communism. Mitford said that her parents had &quot;appeased Hitler and Nazism. ... He had crushed the trade unions, he had crushed the Communist Party and he had crushed the Jews ... and don&#x27;t forget there&#x27;s a huge strain of anti-Semitism that runs through that class in England.&quot; She was known as the &quot;red sheep&quot; of the family.

==Marriages and family==

===Life with Esmond Romilly===
At the age of 19, Mitford fell in love with her second cousin, Esmond Romilly, who was recuperating from dysentery caught while defending Madrid with the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War. Romilly was a nephew (by marriage) of Winston Churchill. The cousins eloped to Spain, where Romilly picked up work as a reporter for the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;. After some legal difficulties caused by their relatives&#x27; opposition, they married. They moved to London and lived in the East End, then mostly a poor industrial area. Mitford gave birth at home to a daughter, Julia Decca Romilly, on 20 December 1937. The baby died in a measles epidemic the following May. Jessica Mitford rarely spoke of Julia in later life, and she is not referred to by name in Mitford&#x27;s 1960 autobiography, &quot;Hons and Rebels&quot;.

In 1939, Romilly and Mitford emigrated to the United States. They travelled around, working odd jobs. At the outset of World War II, Romilly enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force; Mitford was living in Washington D.C., and considered joining him once he was posted to England. While living in D.C, with contemporaries Virginia Foster Durr and Clifford Durr, she gave birth to another daughter, Constancia Romilly (&quot;the Donk&quot; or &quot;Dinky&quot;) on 9 February 1941. Her husband went missing in action on 30 November 1941, on his way back from a bombing raid over Nazi Germany. Mitford was devastated.

===Life with Robert Treuhaft===
Mitford threw herself into war work. Through this, she met and married the American civil rights lawyer Robert Treuhaft in 1943 and eventually settled in Oakland, California. She became an American citizen in 1944.

There, the couple had two sons; Nicholas, born in 1944 (who was killed in 1955 when hit by a bus), and Benjamin, born in 1947. Mitford approached her motherhood in a spirit of &quot;benign neglect&quot;, described by her children as &quot;matter-of-fact&quot; and &quot;not touchy-feely&quot;. She became closer to her own mother by letter over the decades, but remained estranged from her sister Diana for the rest of her life.

==Career and politics==

===Communism and left-wing politics===
Mitford and Treuhaft became active members of the Communist Party in 1943. Mitford spent much of the early 1950s working as executive secretary of the local Civil Rights Congress chapter. Through this and her husband&#x27;s legal practice, she was involved in a number of civil rights campaigns, notably the failed attempt to stop the execution of Willie McGee, an African American convicted of raping a white woman. In 1953, as Communist Party members at the height of McCarthyism and the &#x27;Red Scare&#x27;, they were summoned to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Both refused to name radical groups and friends or testify about their participation in Communist organisations, and were dismissed as &#x27;unresponsive&#x27;.

In 1956, Mitford published a pamphlet, &quot;Lifeitselfmanship or How to Become a Precisely-Because Man&quot;. In response to &quot;Noblesse Oblige&quot;, the book her sister Nancy co-wrote and edited on the class distinctions in British English, popularizing the phrases &quot;U and non-U English&quot; (upper class and non-upper class), Jessica described L and non-L (Left and non-Left) English, mocking the clichés used by her comrades in the all-out class struggle. (The title alludes to Stephen Potter&#x27;s satirical series of books that included &quot;Lifemanship&quot;.)

Mitford and Treuhaft resigned from the American Communist Party in 1958, because they had come to the conclusion they could pursue their ideals more effectively outside the party. Mitford felt the party had become &quot;rather useless&quot;.

In 1960, Mitford published her first book &quot;Hons and Rebels&quot; (US title: &quot;Daughters and Rebels&quot;), a memoir covering her youth in the Mitford household.

===Investigative journalism===
In May 1961, Mitford travelled to Montgomery, Alabama, while working on an article about Southern attitudes for &quot;Esquire&quot;. While there, she and a friend went to meet the arrival of a group of Freedom Riders and became caught up in a riot when a mob, led by the Ku Klux Klan, attacked the civil rights activists. After the riot, Mitford proceeded to a rally led by Martin Luther King Jr. The church at which this was held was also attacked by the Klan, and Mitford and the group spent the night barricaded inside until the siege was ended by the arrival of Alabama National Guard troops.

Through his work with unions and death benefits, Treuhaft became interested in the funeral industry and persuaded Mitford to write an investigative article on the subject. Though the article, &quot;Saint Peter Don&#x27;t You Call Me&quot;, published in &quot;Frontier&quot; magazine, was not widely disseminated, it caught considerable attention when Mitford appeared on a local television broadcast with two industry representatives. Convinced of public interest, she wrote &quot;The American Way of Death&quot;, which was published in 1963. In the book, Mitford harshly criticized the industry for using unscrupulous business practices to take advantage of grieving families. The book became a major best-seller and led to Congressional hearings on the funeral industry. The book was one of the inspirations for filmmaker Tony Richardson&#x27;s 1965 film &quot;The Loved One&quot;, which was based on Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s short satirical 1948 novel of the same name, subtitled &quot;An Anglo-American Tragedy&quot;.

After &quot;The American Way of Death&quot;, Mitford continued with her investigative journalism. In 1970, she published an article in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;Let Us Now Appraise Famous Writers&quot;, an exposé of the Famous Writers School, a correspondence course of questionable business practices founded by Bennett Cerf. She published &quot;The Trial of Dr. Spock, the Rev. William Sloane Coffin, Jr., Michael Ferber, Mitchell Goodman and Marcus Raskin&quot;, an account of the five men&#x27;s 1970 trial on charges of conspiracy to violate the draft laws, followed by a harsh critique of the American prison system entitled &quot;Kind and Usual Punishment: The Prison Business&quot; (1973), an allusion to the phrase &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot;.

Mitford was a distinguished professor for the one semester in 1973 at San Jose State University, where she taught a course called &quot;The American Way&quot; that covered the Watergate scandal and the McCarthy era. The dean insisted that the rule was that she had to swear a loyalty oath and be fingerprinted, although this was not in her contract; she objected, and the campus was thrown into protests and she was forced to go to court to remain able to teach.

===Books and music===

Mitford&#x27;s second memoir, &quot;A Fine Old Conflict&quot; (1977), comically describes her experiences joining and eventually leaving the Communist Party USA. Mitford titled the book after what, in her youth, she thought were the lyrics to the Communist anthem, &quot;The Internationale&quot;, which actually are &quot;&#x27;Tis the final conflict&quot;. Mitford recounts how she was invited to join the Communist Party by her co-worker Dobby, to whom she responded, &quot;We thought you&#x27;d never ask!&quot; She bristled against the conservative structure in the CP, at one point upsetting the women&#x27;s caucus by printing a poster with &quot;Girls! Girls! Girls!&quot; to draw people to an event. She mercilessly teased an elder Communist about what she perceived as his paranoia when he wrote out the name of a town where she could get chickens donated from &quot;loyal party members&quot; for a fund raiser. When he wrote Petaluma on a scrap of paper to avoid being overheard by possible bugs, she asked in jest how the chickens should be prepared, and wrote, &quot;Fried or broiled&quot;.

In addition to writing and activism, Mitford tried her hand at music as singer for &quot;Decca and the Dectones&quot;, a cowbell and kazoo orchestra. She performed at numerous benefits and opened for Cyndi Lauper on the roof of the Virgin Records store in San Francisco. She recorded two short albums: one contains her rendition of &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s Silver Hammer&quot; and &quot;Grace Darling&quot;, and the other, two duets with friend and poet Maya Angelou. Her last work was an update entitled &quot;The American Way of Death Revisited&quot;.

==Death==
Mitford died of lung cancer in 1996, aged 78. She died in Oakland, California, where she also spent most of her life. In keeping with her wishes, she had an inexpensive funeral, costing $533.31 – she was cremated without a ceremony, her ashes scattered at sea. At the time of her death, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; columnist Herb Caen wrote &quot;In this strangely flat era of &#x27;diversity,&#x27; she was the rarest of birds, an exotic creature who rose each morning to become the sun around whom thousands of lives revolved.&quot;

Her widower, Robert Treuhaft, survived her by five years.

==Descendants==
Two of her four children pre-deceased her.

Her surviving daughter, Constancia Romilly, continued the activist tradition, working for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which campaigned for African American civil rights; she eventually became an emergency room nurse. Romilly had two children with Committee director James Forman: James Forman Jr., a Yale professor and Pulitzer Prize-winning author, and Chaka Forman, an actor.

Her younger son, Ben Treuhaft, is a piano tuner based in Coventry, UK.

==Legacy and influence==
John Pilger, who had interviewed Mitford in 1983 for his series &quot;Outsiders&quot;, said she &quot;combined a finely honed social conscience and a wonderful gallows humor. She inverted stereotypes. I liked her enormously&quot;.

The author Christopher Hitchens expressed his admiration for Jessica Mitford and praised &quot;Hons and Rebels&quot;.

J. K. Rowling, author of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, stated in 2002:

Rowling reviewed Mitford&#x27;s book of letters, &quot;Decca&quot;, in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; in 2006.

In 2010, Leslie Brody&#x27;s biography of Mitford, &quot;Irrepressible, The Life and Times of Jessica Mitford&quot; was published by Counterpoint Press.

In 2013, the singer David Bowie named &quot;The American Way of Death&quot; as one of his favorite books.

<text>Oxford Township is a township in Warren County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 2,444, a decrease of 70 (−2.8%) from the 2010 census count of 2,514, which in turn reflected an increase of 207 (+9.0%) from the 2,307 counted in the 2000 census.

Oxford Township was formed from portions of Greenwich Township on May 30, 1754, while the area was still part of Sussex County. It was incorporated on February 21, 1798, as one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial group of townships by an act of the New Jersey Legislature. Mansfield Township became part of the newly formed Warren County on November 20, 1824. Over the centuries since its creation, portions of the township were taken to form Knowlton Township (February 23, 1763), Franklin Township, Harmony Township and Hope Township (all on April 8, 1839), Belvidere (April 7, 1845) and White Township (April 9, 1913).

The origin of the name and the exact date of the township&#x27;s creation is in dispute. One source says that the township was named for the University of Oxford in England, and was formed in either 1753 or 1755, but other sources claim that the township was named after an early settler named John Axford, who came to settle in the area with others between 1735 and 1739, and affirms that the township&#x27;s creation was in 1755.

Oxford Furnace, constructed in 1741, was the third furnace in Colonial New Jersey and the first constructed at a site where iron ore was mined. Other furnaces used ore extracted from bogs in South Jersey, impure deposits called bog iron. Oxford Furnace operated the longest of any of the Colonial-era furnaces, not being &quot;blown out&quot; until 1884. In 1835, it was the site of America&#x27;s first successful use of the hot blast in which preheated air was blown into the furnace, cutting production time. Though worn down by time, much of the site still stands. Oxford Furnace is listed on the State and the National Register of Historic Places.

The Township Committee is comprised of three members, who are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with one seat coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle. At an annual reorganization meeting held during the first week of January, the Township Committee selects one of its members to serve as Mayor and another to serve as Deputy Mayor.

, members of the Oxford Township Committee are Mayor Gerald S. Norton (R, term on committee ends December 31, 2024; term as mayor ends 2022), Deputy Mayor Georgette Miller (R, term on committee and as deputy mayor ends 2022) and Linda Koufodonetes (R, 2023; elected to serve an unexpired term).

In August 2021, the committee selected Linda Koufodontes to fill the vacant seat expiring in December 2023 that had been held by Robert Nyland until he resigned from office. Koufodontes served on an interim basis until the November 2021 general election, when she was chosen to serve the balance of the term of office.

After committee member Keith Gibbons resigned in July 2014 in the wake of harassment claims, Mayor Jade White and committee member Jim Williams resigned in August 2014 after realizing that Williams should have been up for election the previous November following his appointment to office. This left the township with no serving council members.

<text>Phillipsburg is a town located along the Delaware River that is the most populous municipality in Warren County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is part of the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ metropolitan statistical area. As of the 2020 United States census, the town&#x27;s population was 15,249, an increase of 299 (+2.0%) from the 2010 census count of 14,950, which in turn reflected a decline of 216 (−1.4%) from the 15,166 counted in the 2000 census.

The Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Lehigh Line, formerly the mainline of the Lehigh Valley Railroad with a mix of mainline trackage combined long leased to the Central Railroad of New Jersey by its builder Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company, runs through Phillipsburg and then across the Delaware River into Easton, Pennsylvania. The Belvidere Delaware Railroad was leased in 1871 and later acquired by the Pennsylvania Railroad, connecting the lower Poconos to Trenton, New Jersey, and Philadelphia.

Phillipsburg is located northeast of Allentown, north of Philadelphia, and west of New York City.

==History==
The town grew from a sleepy agricultural village (in 1824), and was transformed into a transportation hub and shipping center as the Delaware River terminus of the Morris Canal (1829–1924), with operations commencing in 1831, the first of several transportation infrastructure projects that gave the community a direct connection to New York City. The Central Railroad of New Jersey soon followed with a connection. The community&#x27;s growth soon reached the canal terminals of both the Delaware Canal and the Lehigh Canal by its cross-river cable ferry system to Easton, Pennsylvania. In 1853, the Lehigh Valley Railroad connected across the river with the Central Railroad of New Jersey and a passenger short line railroad, the Belvidere Delaware Railroad, and Morris Canal, all within Phillipsburg, which was followed by rapid growth.

On March 8, 1861, Phillipsburg was incorporated as a town by an act of the New Jersey Legislature from portions of Phillipsburg Township, which is now Lopatcong Township. The town was named for William Phillips, an early settler of the area.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town had a total area of 3.31 square miles (8.58 km2), including 3.19 square miles (8.26 km2) of land and 0.12 square miles (0.31 km2) of water (3.66%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the town include Andover Furnace, Delaware Park, Lopatcong Heights, Shirmers and Warren Heights.

Pohatcong Mountain is a ridge, approximately long, in the Appalachian Mountains that extends from Phillipsburg northeast approximately to Washington.

Phillipsburg borders the municipalities of Lopatcong Township and Pohatcong Township in Warren County; and both Easton, Pennsylvania, and Williams Township across the Delaware River in Northampton County, Pennsylvania.

==Economy==
===Industrial history===
Phillipsburg had historically benefited from being a major transportation hub, then manufacturing with the investments by Ingersoll Rand in 1903 by opening the first Ingersoll-Sergeant factory in Phillipsburg. Within a year it employed 1,000 people, reaching a peak of 5,000. The town is situated at the confluence of the Delaware and Lehigh rivers. Phillipsburg served as the western terminus of the Morris Canal for approximately 100 years from the 1830s to 1920s, which connected the city by water to the industrial and consumer centers of the New York City area, with connections westward via the Lehigh Canal and Delaware Canal across the Delaware. Long gone is the era of canal shipping and many of the important freight railways that served the area have gone bankrupt or bypass the city on long-distance routes.

Phillipsburg was served by five major railroads: 
* Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) 
* Lehigh and Hudson River Railway (L&amp;HR) 
* Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR)
* Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Phillipsburg Branch (DL&amp;W) 
* Pennsylvania Railroad Belvidere Division (PRR)

===Economic revival===
A majority of the manufacturing jobs left Warren County&#x27;s largest city once Ingersoll Rand closed operations in 2000.

Portions of the town are part of an Urban Enterprise Zone (UEZ), one of 32 zones covering 37 municipalities statewide. The city was selected in 1994 as one of a group of 10 zones added to participate in the program. In addition to other benefits to encourage employment within the UEZ, shoppers can take advantage of a reduced 3.3125% sales tax rate (half of the % rate charged statewide) at eligible merchants. Established in November 1994, the town&#x27;s Urban Enterprise Zone status expires in October 2025.

Businesses have begun to move on to South Main Street, including the opening of the Apothecarium Dispensary – Phillipsburg in November 2019 
selling marijuana, the Town Council voted in June 2021 to adopt an ordinance preventing the opening of any other cannabis retailers.

===Railway===
A tourist railroad known as the Belvidere &amp; Delaware River Railroad operates on the former Belvidere-Delaware Railroad Pennsylvania Railroad Branch serving excursions from Lehigh Junction Station south to Carpentersville. Norfolk Southern serves the industrial manufacturing purposes in Phillipsburg using former LVRR tracks and the L&amp;HR bridge to connect with the Bel-Del PRR tracks.

Since 2007, NJ Transit has been conducting a study to determine if re-establishing a commuter rail extension of the Raritan Valley Line to Phillipsburg is economically feasible.

Phillipsburg also is home to the Phillipsburg Railroad Historians museum. They display railroad memorabilia inside the museum, an &quot;N&quot; scale diorama, two Lehigh and Hudson River cabooses, one of which is currently being restored, and a Jersey Central caboose. There is an L&amp;HR snow flanger, Tidewater tank car, a CNJ box car owned by the Anthracite Railroads Historical Society, a 1922 Chestnut Ridge Mack railbus owned by the Lehigh Valley NRHS, a Public Service trolley owned by the North Jersey Electric Railway Historical Society, a 44-ton GE locomotive and a 25-ton GE locomotive. They operate a miniature railroad, the Centerville &amp; Southwestern, that formerly ran in Roseland, New Jersey.

<text>Washington is a borough in Warren County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 7,299, an increase of 838 (+13.0%) from the 2010 census count of 6,461, which in turn reflected a decline of 251 (−3.7%) from the 6,712 counted in the 2000 census.

Washington was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 20, 1868, from portions of Washington Township. The borough was named for George Washington, one of more than ten communities in the state of New Jersey that were named for the first president. The Borough of Washington is surrounded by Washington Township, which is one of five municipalities in the state of New Jersey with the name &quot;Washington Township&quot;.

The borough had the 26th-highest property tax rate in New Jersey, with an equalized rate of 4.206% in 2020, compared to 2.967% in the county as a whole and a statewide average of 2.279%.

==History==
Washington Borough separated from Washington Township as of February 20, 1868. The community grew during the 19th century as a result of the transportation routes that ran through or near the borough. The Morris Canal ran along the north end of town and two rail lines of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad crossed within the borough. Intersecting in the center of the borough are two major roadways, which today are Route 31 and Route 57. The borough was ultimately named for the &quot;Washington House&quot;, a tavern built by Revolutionary War Col. William McCullough in 1811 that was later destroyed by fire in 1869.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the borough became a mecca of musical instruments manufacturers, the manufacture of organs in particular. A bustling downtown developed around these businesses. Many of the Victorian style houses in the borough, as well as Taylor Street School and Warren Hills Middle School (formerly Washington High School) were built during this period.

The advent of the automobile brought Washington closer to both the Lehigh Valley and New York City. In the years following World War II, the population increased, and there were many new houses and apartment complexes built. A portion of the Downtown area was devastated by a major fire in 1962. Education at the Middle and High School level was regionalized in 1968, and a new elementary school was also built (Memorial School).

The 1990s saw a population boom in Warren County, which continues today, as high real estate prices and property taxes in New Jersey&#x27;s northeastern counties push buyers to look further west. Although the borough itself does not have much room to grow, it has benefited from the growth of the nearby townships. Efforts are underway to revitalize the downtown with new residential and retail properties.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 1.97 square miles (5.10 km2), including 1.97 square miles (5.09 km2) of land and &lt;0.01 square miles (0.01 km2) of water (0.15%).

The borough of Washington is completely surrounded by Washington Township, making it part of 21 pairs of &quot;doughnut towns&quot; in the state, where one municipality entirely surrounds another.

Pohatcong Mountain is a ridge, approximately long, in the Appalachian Mountains that extends from west Phillipsburg northeast approximately to Washington. Upper Pohatcong Mountain extends northeast of Washington approximately to the vicinity of Hackettstown. The two ridges are sometimes called &quot;Pohatcong Mountain&quot; collectively.

Washington operates within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Council-Manager form of municipal government. The borough is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the six-member borough council, all of whom are elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general elections. The mayor and members of the borough council are elected to four-year terms on a staggered basis, with either two seats (plus the mayor) or four seats coming up for election in even-numbered years. The council selects a borough manager who is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the municipality.

, the borough&#x27;s Mayor is Democrat Ethel Conry, who was elected to serve an unexpired term of office ending on December 31, 2024. Members of the Borough Council are Deputy mayor Louann M. Cox (Republican, 2024), Jerry Brown (R, 2026), Edward France (R, 2026), Cassandra Gorshkov (R, 2026), Christopher Infinito (R, 2024;appointed to an unexpired term) and Sherri Musick (R, 2026).

In January 2022, the borough council appointed Sonia Ron to fill the seat expiring in December 2022 that had been held by Chelsea Duchemin.

Following the resignation of Mayor David Higgins in December 2021, the borough council voted the following month to leave the position vacant until the November 2022 general election, when voters will choose a candidate to serve the balance of the term of office through December 2024. In the November 2022 general election, Ethel Conry was elected to fill the remainder of the mayoral term.

In January 2017, Paul Jones was selected on an interim basis to fill the seat expiring in December 2018 that became vacant when David Higgins took office as mayor. Dewayne Keith Norris was elected in November 2017 to fill the vacant seat for the remainder of the term of office. A month later, the borough was informed that Norris had faced a number of criminal charges in previous decades including having been sentenced in 1994 to serve 45 days in jail on a misdemeanor larceny charge. The council passed a symbolic no confidence vote by a 4-2 margin, though Norris indicated that he was unwilling to resign from office.

Kristine Henry, who had served as Washington&#x27;s clerk and borough manager, was sentenced in January 2018 to seven years in jail, lost her ability to work in a public job and was required to repay $97,000 she had stolen from the borough after writing a series of checks payable to herself from 2011 to 2016. Her role was filled by Matthew Hall, who was the borough&#x27;s manager for several years and helped improve the town&#x27;s sewers, garbage collection system, and paved the way for new businesses and residences to be built in the area.

<text>Washington Township is a township in Warren County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 6,492, a decrease of 159 (−2.4%) from the 2010 census count of 6,651, which in turn reflected an increase of 403 (+6.5%) from the 6,248 counted in the 2000 census.

The township is one of six municipalities in New Jersey under the name Washington (one of which is a borough, five of which are townships). Washington Township, Warren County completely surrounds the borough of Washington. Mansfield Township, also in Warren County, borders both this municipality and another Washington Township in Morris County.

Washington Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 9, 1849, from portions of Mansfield Township. Portions of the township were taken on February 20, 1868, to create Washington Borough. The township was named for George Washington, one of more than ten communities statewide named for the first president. It is one of five municipalities in the state of New Jersey with the name &quot;Washington Township&quot;. Another municipality, Washington Borough, is completely surrounded by Washington Township.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 18.05 square miles (46.75 km2), including 17.96 square miles (46.52 km2) of land and 0.09 square miles (0.23 km2) of water (0.49%).

Brass Castle (with a 2010 Census population of 1,555) and Port Colden (2010 population of 122) are unincorporated communities and census-designated places (CDPs) located within the township.

Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Bowerstown, Butlers Park, Changewater, Fort Golden, Imlaydale, and Pleasant Valley.

Washington Township borders the municipalities of Franklin Township, Mansfield Township, Oxford Township and White Township in Warren County; and Bethlehem Township, Hampton and Lebanon Township in Hunterdon County. The borough of Washington is completely surrounded by Washington Township, making it part of 21 pairs of &quot;doughnut towns&quot; in the state, where one municipality entirely surrounds another.

==Demographics==
The township&#x27;s economic data (as is all of Warren County) is calculated by the US Census Bureau as part of the Lehigh Valley / Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ Metropolitan Statistical Area.

<text>Carnuel is a census-designated place (CDP) in Bernalillo County, New Mexico, United States. The population was 1,232 at the 2010 Census. It is part of the Albuquerque Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== Name ==

Robert Hixson Julyan reports that name of the community, which has been spelled both Carnuel and Carnué, likely derives from the Tiwa word for &quot;badger place.&quot; This hypothesis is supported by indigenous residents.

== History ==

Carnuel (full name San Miguel de Loredo de Carnué) is east of the original center of the city of Albuquerque. The town was created in 1763 to defend Albuquerque from the raids of Comanche, Kiowa, and Plains Apache American Indians. The town is located at the mouth of Tijeras Canyon, a strategic and natural corridor between the hostile Indians of the Great Plains and the Spanish settlements of the Rio Grande valley. Nineteen men some with families, comprised the first settlers at Carnuel. They were mostly from the lower castas of Spanish society, &quot;mestizo&quot; (“half blood,” mixed race Indians and Spanish) and genízaros (Indians who lived among the Spanish and had adopted some elements of Hispanic culture). For the mestizo and genízaros the attraction to settle at Carnuel and other genízaro settlements was the opportunity to own land through a land grant from the New Mexican government.

Apache raiders killed several people in the area and the survivors abandoned the settlement in 1771. Carnuel was resettled in 1819 by descendants of the original settlers plus additional landless mestizos. Twenty-two families were given land at Carnuel and another 22 received land at San Antonio, a community about northeast of Carnuel. By that time New Mexico had made peace with the Comanche and the threat to the eastern frontiers of the colony had decreased, making the settlement feasible. The genízaro heritage continued to influence land and water usage rights in the Carnuel land grant into the 21st century. Also within the original area of the land grant are the village of Tijeras and Cedar Crest CDP (census designated place).

<text>Unity Valkyrie Freeman-Mitford (8 August 1914 – 28 May 1948) was a British fascist and socialite and member of the Mitford family known for her relationship with Adolf Hitler. Both in the United Kingdom and Germany, she was a prominent supporter of Nazism, fascism and antisemitism, and belonged to Hitler&#x27;s inner circle of friends. 

When the United Kingdom declared war on Germany she attempted suicide in Munich by shooting herself in the head, surviving, but with extensive brain damage. She returned to England but never recovered, ultimately dying from consequences of the wound.

==Childhood==
Unity Mitford was the fifth of seven children born in London to David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale, and his wife, Sydney, daughter of Thomas Gibson Bowles. The Mitford family is an aristocratic family tracing its origins in Northumberland back to the 11th-century Norman settlement of England.

Mitford was, accidentally, conceived in Canada in the town of Swastika, Ontario where her family had gold mines. Her siblings were Nancy (1904–1973), Pamela (1907–1994), Thomas (1909–1945), Diana (1910–2003), Jessica (1917–1996), and Deborah (1920–2014), later the Duchess of Devonshire. The Mitford children lived at Asthall Manor in Asthall, Oxfordshire, and Unity was educated at St Margaret&#x27;s School, Bushey.

It has been speculated that Unity turned to Nazism as a way to distinguish herself within the family. As Dalley states: &quot;I think the desire to shock was very important, it was the way that she made herself special. When she discovered Nazism and discovered that it was a fantastic opportunity to shock everybody in England she’d discovered the best tease of all.&quot;

Diana Mosley’s biographer, Jan Dalley, believes that &quot;Unity found life in her big family very difficult because she came after these cleverer, prettier, more accomplished sisters.&quot; While another biographer, David Pryce-Jones, added: &quot;If you come from a ruck of children in a large family, you&#x27;ve got to do something to assert your individuality, and I think through the experience of trying to force her way forward among the sisters and in the family, she decided that she was going to form a personality against everything&quot;. 

Unity’s younger sister, Jessica, with whom she shared a bedroom, went to the opposite end of the political spectrum, since she became a dedicated communist. The two drew a chalk line down the middle to divide the room. Jessica&#x27;s side was decorated with hammer and sickles and pictures of Vladimir Lenin, while Unity&#x27;s was decorated with swastikas and pictures of Adolf Hitler. Dalley commented, &quot;They were kids virtually, you don&#x27;t know how much it was just a game, a game that became deadly serious in later life.&quot;

==Social debut==
Mitford was a debutante in 1932. That same year, her elder sister Diana left her husband to pursue an affair with Oswald Mosley, who had just founded the British Union of Fascists. Their father was furious at the disgrace and forbade any member of the family to see either Diana or &quot;The Man Mosley&quot;, as he termed him. 

Unity disobeyed and she met with Mosley that summer at a party thrown by Diana, where she was promised a party badge. Mosley&#x27;s son, Nicholas, recalled: &quot;Unity became a very extrovert member of the party, which was her way [...] She joined my father&#x27;s party and she used to turn up, she used to go around in a black shirt uniform, and she used to turn up at communist meetings and she used to do the fascist salute and heckle the speaker. That was the sort of person she was&quot;. He adds that although his father admired Unity&#x27;s commitment, Mosley felt &quot;She wasn&#x27;t doing him any good, because she was making an exhibition of herself.&quot;

Unity and Diana Mitford travelled to Germany, as part of the British delegation from the British Union of Fascists to the 1933 Nuremberg Rally, seeing Hitler for the first time. Mitford later said, &quot;The first time I saw him I knew there was no one I would rather meet.&quot; Biographer Anne de Courcy confirms: &quot;The Nuremberg rally had a profound effect on both Diana and Unity. . . Unity was already, as it were, convinced about Hitler, but this turned conviction into worship. From then on, she wanted to be near Hitler as much as possible&quot;.

==Arrival in Germany==
Mitford returned to Germany in the summer of 1934, enrolling in a language school in Munich close to the Nazi Party headquarters. Dalley notes &quot;She was obsessed with meeting Hitler, so she really set out to stalk him.&quot; Pryce Jones elaborates: 

After ten months, Hitler finally invited her to his table, where they talked for over 30 minutes, with Hitler picking up her bill. In a letter to her father, Mitford wrote: &quot;It was the most wonderful and beautiful [day] of my life. I am so happy that I wouldn&#x27;t mind a bit, dying. I&#x27;d suppose I am the luckiest girl in the world. For me he is the greatest man of all time&quot;. Hitler became smitten with the young blonde British student. He was struck by her curious connections to the Germanic culture, including her middle name, Valkyrie.

Mitford&#x27;s grandfather, Bertram Freeman-Mitford, had been a friend of Richard Wagner, one of Hitler&#x27;s idols, and had written introductions to two works of Houston Stewart Chamberlain. Dalley says, &quot;Hitler was extremely superstitious, and he believed that Unity was sort of sent to him, it was destined.&quot; Mitford subsequently received invitations to party rallies and state occasions and was described by Hitler as &quot;a perfect specimen of Aryan womanhood.&quot;

Hitler and Mitford became close, with Hitler reportedly playing Mitford off against his new girlfriend, Eva Braun, apparently to make her jealous. Braun wrote of Mitford in her diary: &quot;She is known as the Valkyrie and looks the part, including her legs. I the mistress of the greatest man in Germany and the whole world, I sit here waiting while the sun mocks me through the window panes.&quot; Braun regained Hitler&#x27;s attention after an attempted suicide and Mitford learned from this that desperate measures were often needed to capture the Führer&#x27;s attention.

Mitford attended the Hitler Youth festival in Hesselberg with Hitler&#x27;s friend Julius Streicher, where she gave a virulently anti-semitic speech. She subsequently repeated these sentiments in an open letter to Streicher&#x27;s paper, &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;, which read: &quot;The English have no notion of the Jewish danger. Our worst Jews work only behind the scenes. We think with joy of the day when we will be able to say England for the English! Out with the Jews! Heil Hitler! P.S. please publish my name in full, I want everyone to know I am a Jew hater.&quot; The letter caused public outrage in Britain, but Hitler rewarded her with an engraved golden swastika badge, a private box at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, and a ride in a party Mercedes to the Bayreuth Festival.

==Inside the inner circle==

From this point on, Mitford was inducted into Hitler&#x27;s inner circle and remained with him for five years. When Hitler announced the Anschluss in 1938, she appeared with him on the balcony in Vienna. She was later arrested in Prague for distributing Nazi propaganda. Pryce Jones reports that &quot;She [Mitford] saw him, it seemed, more than a hundred times, no other English person could have anything like that access to Hitler&quot;, and the suspicions of the British SIS were aroused. 

MI5 officer Guy Liddell wrote in his diary: &quot;Unity Mitford had been in close and intimate contact with the Führer and his supporters for several years, and was an ardent and open supporter of the Nazi regime. She had remained behind after the outbreak of war and her action had come perilously close to high treason.&quot; A 1936 report went further, proclaiming her &quot;more Nazi than the Nazis&quot;, and stated that she gave the Hitler salute to the British Consul General in Munich, who immediately requested that her passport be impounded. In 1938, Hitler gave her a choice of four apartments in Munich. 

Mitford is reported to have visited one apartment to discuss her decoration and design plans while the soon-to-be-dispossessed residents, a Jewish couple, sat in the kitchen crying. Immediately prior to this, she had lived in the house of Erna Hanfstaengl, sister of early Hitler admirer and confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl, but was ordered to leave when Hitler became angry with the Hanfstaengls.

Many prominent Nazis were also suspicious of Mitford and her relationship to their Führer. In his memoirs, &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot;, Albert Speer said of Hitler&#x27;s select group: &quot;One tacit agreement prevailed: No one must mention politics. The sole exception was Lady [&quot;sic&quot;] Mitford, who even in the later years of international tension persistently spoke up for her country and often actually pleaded with Hitler to make a deal with Britain. In spite of Hitler&#x27;s discouraging reserve, she did not abandon her efforts through all those years&quot;. Mitford summered at the Berghof where she continued to discuss a possible German–British alliance with Hitler, going so far as to supply lists of potential supporters and enemies.

At the 1939 Bayreuth Festival, Hitler warned Unity and her sister Diana that war with Britain was inevitable within weeks and they should return home. Diana returned to England, while Unity chose to remain in Germany, though her family sent pleas for her to come home. After Britain&#x27;s declaration of war on Germany on 3 September 1939, Unity was distraught. Diana Mitford told an interviewer in 1999: &quot;She told me that if there was a war, which of course we all terribly hoped there might not be, that she would kill herself because she couldn&#x27;t bear to live and see these two countries tearing each other to pieces, both of which she loved.&quot; 

On the morning of 3 September, she visited the Gauleiter Adolf Wagner to inquire if she would be detained as an enemy alien, receiving assurances from Wagner that she would not. He was concerned by her demeanour and assigned two men to follow her, but she managed to shake them off by the time she entered the English Garden in Munich, where she took a pearl-handled pistol given to her by Hitler for protection and shot herself in the head. She survived, though badly injured, and was hospitalised in Munich, where Hitler frequently visited her. He paid her bills and arranged for her return home.

==Return to Britain==
In December 1939, Mitford was moved to a hospital in Bern in neutral Switzerland, where her mother and youngest sister, Deborah, went to collect her. In a 2002 letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Deborah relates the experience: &quot;We were not prepared for what we found – the person lying in bed was desperately ill. She had lost , was all huge eyes and matted hair, untouched since the bullet went through her skull. The bullet was still in her head, inoperable the doctor said. She could not walk, talked with difficulty and was a changed personality, like one who had had a stroke. Not only was her appearance shocking, she was a stranger, someone we did not know. We brought her back to England in an ambulance coach attached to a train. Every jolt was agony to her.&quot;

Stating she could remember nothing of the incident, Mitford returned to England with her mother and sister in January 1940 amid a flurry of press interest and her comment, &quot;I&#x27;m glad to be in England, even if I&#x27;m not on your side&quot;, led to public calls for her internment as a traitor. Due to the intervention by Home Secretary John Anderson, at the behest of her father, she was left to live out her days with her mother at the family home at Swinbrook, Oxfordshire. Under the care of Professor Hugh Cairns, neurosurgeon at the Nuffield Hospital in Oxford, &quot;She learned to walk again, but never fully recovered. She was incontinent and childish.&quot; Doctors decided that it was too dangerous to remove the bullet in her head. Her mental age was likened to that of a 10-year-old, or a &quot;sophisticated child&quot; as James Lees-Milne called her, although he continues that she was &quot;still very amusing in that Mitford manner&quot;. 

She had a tendency to talk incessantly, had trouble concentrating her mind, and showed an unusually large appetite with sloppy table manners. Lees-Milne observed her to be &quot;rather plain and fat, and says she weighs &quot;. She retained at least some of her devotion to the Nazi party. Her family friend Billa Harrod recalled Unity stating that she wished to have children and name the eldest Adolf.

Mitford was reported to have had an affair with RAF Pilot Officer John Andrews, a test pilot, who was stationed at the nearby RAF Brize Norton, up to 11 September 1941. MI5 learned of this and reported it to Home Secretary Herbert Morrison in October. He had heard that she &quot;drives about the countryside … and picks up airmen, etc, and … interrogates them.&quot; Andrews, a former bank clerk and a married father, was &quot;removed as far away as the limited extent of the British Isles permits.&quot; He was re-posted to the far north of Scotland, where he died in a Spitfire crash in 1945. Authorities then concluded that Mitford did not pose a significant threat.

From 1943, she also spent long periods in Hillmorton, an area of Rugby in Warwickshire, staying with the local vicar and his family. Mitford was keen to visit her sister Diana in Holloway Prison, and Norah Elam offered to look after Mitford at their home in Logan Place for a short period. Norah Elam and her husband Dudley escorted Mitford to see Diana and Oswald Mosley in Holloway on 18 March 1943.

==Death==

Mitford was taken seriously ill on a visit to the family-owned island of Inch Kenneth and was taken to hospital in Oban. On 28 May 1948, Mitford died of meningitis caused by the cerebral swelling around the bullet, which was still in her head. She was buried at Swinbrook Churchyard; the inscription on her gravestone reads: &quot;Say not the struggle naught availeth.&quot;

==Publication of diaries==
In 2025 diaries believed to be Mitford&#x27;s were discovered, documenting a fascination with Hitler, whom she stalked when she was 20 and moved to Munich. The diaries record 139 meetings with Hitler, ending on 1 September 1939.

==Controversies==
===Allegations of a faked shooting===
On 1 December 2002, following the release of declassified documents (including the diary of wartime MI5 officer Guy Liddell), investigative journalist Martin Bright published an article in &quot;The Observer&quot; saying that Home Secretary John Anderson had intervened to prevent Mitford being questioned on her return from Germany. He also said that the shooting, which &quot;has become part of the Mitford myth&quot;, may have been invented to excuse this.

Bright cites the statements of press photographers and others who witnessed Mitford&#x27;s 3 January 1940 return to Britain that &quot;there were no outward signs of her injury.&quot; Liddell had written on 2 January, &quot;We had no evidence to support the press allegations that she was in a serious state of health, and it might well be that she was brought in on a stretcher in order to avoid publicity and unpleasantness to her family.&quot; Liddell had wanted her and her entourage, which according to Bright included known Nazi supporters, to be searched upon arrival, but the Home Secretary prevented this. On 8 January, Liddell notes receiving a report from the Security Control Officers who were responsible for meeting the arrivals that states &quot;there were no signs of a bullet wound.&quot;

Mitford&#x27;s cousin, Rupert Mitford, 6th Baron Redesdale, replied to the accusations by saying, &quot;I love conspiracy theories but it goes a little far to suggest Unity was faking it. But people did wonder how she was up on her feet so soon after shooting herself in the head.&quot; Unity&#x27;s sister, Deborah, rebutted by stating that the entourage that returned with Unity consisted of herself and their mother and although she could not remember them being searched upon return, that Unity &quot;could not walk, talked with difficulty and was a changed personality, like one who had had a stroke&quot;, and that she has detailed records from Professor Cairns, neurosurgeon at the Nuffield Hospital in Oxford, on her condition, including X-rays showing the bullet. In a 2007 article for &quot;New Statesman&quot;, Bright states, &quot;In fact, Liddell was wrong about her injuries. She had indeed shot herself and later died of an infection caused by the bullet in the brain.&quot;

===Rumours of Hitler&#x27;s baby===
In December 2007, Bright published an article in &quot;New Statesman&quot; stating that following a previous article on Unity Mitford, he had received a phone call from a Ms Val Hann, a member of the public, offering new information on the story. The caller said that during the war, her aunt, Betty Norton, had run Hill View Cottage, a private maternity hospital in Oxford where Mitford had been a client. According to Hann&#x27;s family legend, passed from Betty to Val&#x27;s mother and then on to Val herself, Mitford had checked into the hospital after her return to England where she had given birth to Hitler&#x27;s child, who was subsequently placed for adoption. Bright states he was initially sceptical.

Bright travelled to Wigginton where the current owner of Hill View confirmed that Norton had indeed run the cottage as a maternity hospital during the war. Bright met with elderly village resident Audrey Smith, whose sister had worked at Hill View. She confirmed seeing &quot;Unity wrapped in a blanket and looking very ill&quot; but insisted that she was there to recover from a nervous breakdown and not to give birth.

Bright contacted Unity&#x27;s sister Deborah who denounced the villager&#x27;s gossip and claimed she could produce her mother&#x27;s diaries to prove it. Bright returned to the National Archives where he found a file on Unity sealed under the 100-year rule. He received special permission to open it and discovered that in October 1941, while living at the family home in Swinbrook, she had been consorting with a married RAF test pilot – throwing doubt on her reported invalidity.

Bright then abandoned the investigation, until he mentioned the story to an executive from Channel 4 who thought it was a good subject for a documentary film. Further investigation was then undertaken as part of the filming for &quot;Hitler&#x27;s British Girl&quot;. This included a visit to an Oxfordshire register office, showing an abnormally large number of birth registrations at Hill View at that time, apparently confirming its use as a maternity hospital. No records were found for Mitford, although the records officer stated many births were not registered at this time. The publication of the article and the broadcast of the film the following week stimulated media speculation that Hitler&#x27;s child could be living in the United Kingdom.

==In popular culture==

&quot;Unity&quot;, a play by John Mortimer depicting Mitford&#x27;s time in Berlin, was broadcast on BBC2 on 20 March 1981. Unity was played by Lesley-Anne Down. Mitford is mentioned in the 1958 novella &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; by Truman Capote. Rutherford (&quot;Rusty&quot;) Trawler apparently was supposed to propose to Unity Mitford before the war, if Hitler had not. Mitford&#x27;s connection with Adolf Hitler is the main subject of the novel &quot;Resolution&quot; by Adam Zerny.

<text>Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, also known simply as &quot;Los Ranchos&quot;, is a village in Bernalillo County, New Mexico. The population was 6,024 at the time of the 2010 Census.

==Description==
Part of the Albuquerque metropolitan area, Los Ranchos is located on the east side of the Rio Grande, adjacent to the unincorporated North Valley area. Los Ranchos is surrounded on three sides by the larger city of Albuquerque. Like the North Valley and Corrales, Los Ranchos is a mostly rural area with widely spaced large houses and dense vegetation.

==History==

===Pueblo tribes===
Signs of human activity in the middle Rio Grande valley date back to as early as 10,000 B.C. The introduction of cultivated maize from Mexico in 1,000 B.C. marked a major turning point in the settlement of the region, causing the traditionally nomadic tribes of the area to adopt a more agricultural way of life. The first pueblos in the area appeared between one and 600 A.D., established by the Tiwas (called &quot;Tigua&quot; by the Spaniards), and by 1,200 AD there were already 14 major sites along the Rio Grande from Algodones to Isleta, the Chamisal Site in present-day Los Ranchos being among the largest of these communities.

Hernando de Alvarado was reported as being one of the first Europeans to lay eyes on the region in September 1540 as the leader of a small convoy sent out by Coronado. He described the area as a &quot;broad valley planted with fields of maize and dotted with cottonwood groves. There are twelve pueblos, whose houses are built of mud and are two stories high.&quot;

===Early settlers===
The first colonizing expedition into New Mexico was led by Juan de Oñate in 1598, and the fertile valley between Alameda and Atrisco was gradually populated by settlers living on scattered farms. The settlers were briefly driven out during the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, but returned in 1692. Frequent Apache and Navajo raiding compelled the settlers to consolidate their scattered dwellings into a series of plazas, which were easier to defend. Upriver from Albuquerque, these included Los Duranes, Los Candelarias, Los Griegos, and Los Ranchos, or more formally Plaza de Señor San José de los Ranchos. The Los Ranchos plaza was probably established around 1750, and had 176 residents living in 40 households at the time of the 1790 census. By 1814, the population had increased to 65 households and 331 people, and the village even became the seat of Bernalillo County for a brief period from 1851 to 1854. Unfortunately for its residents, the Los Ranchos area was prone to flooding, and the old village was badly damaged by major floods in 1874 and 1891 before being completely wiped away in a third flood in 1904. The continued flooding also turned much of the land alkaline and untillable.

===Early 20th-century development===
Many of the settling families sold their land to Anglo settlers and speculators after the railroad reached Albuquerque in 1880. In the face of growing demand for more housing, small subdivisions, land holdings and large country estates began to appear along Rio Grande Boulevard, new roads were constructed and existing ones were paved or removed. During the 20th century, a half-mile-long section of the Guadalupe Trail starting just south of Chamisal Road and extending north to Ranchitos Road became known as the new Los Ranchos.

&quot;The 1930s marked a time when Albuquerque families began moving to the North Valley in greater numbers, some buying and restoring abandoned adobe homes, others proceeding to build large new houses.&quot; United States Representatives Albert Simms and his wife Ruth Hanna McCormick were among these families and built two houses designed by Santa Fe architect John Gaw Meem on the site of the current-day Los Poblanos Ranch. The valley continued to be home to many farms and ranches, and dairies were run by both Anglo and Spanish families alike. After World War II there was a new flood of settlers to Albuquerque, and the number of able-bodied men to work the land had thinned. Housing developments began to pop up on any available land around the Valley. Rob Lee Meadows was built on the site of the old Los Ranchos plaza, the farmlands belonging to the Robert Dietz family were turned into the rows of houses of Dietz Farms and over 100 acres of farm owned by the Charles Mann family became the present day Meadows on Rio Grande and Thomas Village homes.

===Founding and incorporation===
This sudden influx of newcomers and development after the war caused alarm that Albuquerque proper would annex Los Ranchos, and residents sought incorporation to prevent such a fate. After a successful vote, the village of Los Ranchos de Albuquerque was incorporated on December 29, 1958. People involved in incorporating the village included William Kitsch, Frederick O&#x27;Hara, Sam Hartnett, Paul Gillespie and Robert Nordhaus. This area contained the least developed section of the valley and included many of the larger homes and remaining open space. Restrictions on lot size and use have kept this area less built up and more verdant than other parts of the North Valley.

Today Los Ranchos has been able to preserve much of its original rural agricultural nature and is one of the most desirable places of high-end residence in the entire Albuquerque area.

==Incorporation efforts==
Presently, the South Valley is an unincorporated area in Bernalillo County that lies south of the city limits of Albuquerque. In January 2010, a special election was held in the South Valley to decide whether or not the region should incorporate into a city, to be named Valle de Atrisco. Voters in the South Valley overwhelmingly rejected incorporation by a 93 to 7 percent margin during the special election on January 5, 2010. Opponents to incorporation cited the potential costs (and tax burden for residents) for providing for education, public works, police and fire services in the South Valley because Bernalillo County would no longer be providing these services to the community following incorporation. Supporters argued in favor of incorporation to protect the community from possible annexation into the City of Albuquerque, and the potential for increased taxes and perceived degradation of public services that would arise from being integrated into the city.

==Education==
It is zoned to Albuquerque Public Schools.

Rio Grande High School is in the South Valley.

<text>Tijeras is a village in Bernalillo County, New Mexico, United States. The population was 465 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Albuquerque metropolitan area.

==Pre-Columbian==

The Tijeras Pueblo Archaeological Site is located in Tijeras at 35° 04′ 30″ N, 106° 23′ 01.″ The site was occupied by Ancestral Pueblo people from about 1313 CE to 1425 CE. In the first phase of its occupation the Tijeras Pueblo had about 200 rooms in terraced buildings arranged in a &quot;U&quot; shape with a large ceremonial Kiva at the center. The pueblo was partially abandoned after about 1360 but rebuilding began about 1390, although the pueblo never regained its previous size. It was abandoned about 1425. The reasons for the abandonment of the pueblo are unknown, although it may have been because of drought and water shortages.

The Tijeras Pueblo Archaeological Site is open to visitors. A museum on the site is open weekends and a self-guiding trail winds through the ruins.

==History==

Tijeras was part of the Carnuel land grant, created in 1763 to defend Albuquerque from the raids of Comanche, Kiowa, and Plains Apache American Indians. The village is located in Tijeras Canyon, a strategic and natural corridor between the nomadic Indians of the Great Plains and the Spanish settlements in the Rio Grande valley. Nineteen men some with families, comprised the first settlers at Carnuel. They were mostly from the lower castas of Spanish society, &quot;coyotes&quot; and genizaros (Indians who lived among the Spanish and had adopted some elements of Hispanic culture). For the coyotes and genizaros the attraction to settle in the Tijeras area was the opportunity to own land through the land grant from the New Mexican government.

Apache raiders killed several people in the area and the survivors abandoned the land grant area in 1771. The Mescalero Apache name for Tijeras canyon is Nakai&#x27;e Naagishuł or &quot;Mexican they dragged&quot;. The Tijeras area was resettled in 1819 by descendants of the original settlers plus additional landless mestizos. By that time New Mexico had made peace with the Comanche and the threat to the eastern frontiers of the colony had decreased, making the settlement feasible. The genizaro heritage continued to influence land and water usage rights in the Carnuel land grant into the 21st century.

Currently the village has two grocery stores, a hardware store, a bar, fairgrounds, and a health clinic. It is the site where Elfego Baca held off a gang of Texan cowboys who wanted to kill him for arresting cowboy Charles McCarty.

==History==
In the 1860s, Mexican-Americans established a string of villages along the San Francisco River, naming them the Upper, Lower, and Middle San Francisco Plazas. In the late 1870s Anglo settlers began arriving. They renamed Upper Frisco Plaza as Milligan&#x27;s Plaza, naming it after a merchant and saloon owner.

Catron became a county in 1921. It was named after an attorney and political leader from Santa Fe, Thomas B. Catron.

Milligan&#x27;s Plaza was the site of the Frisco shootout of Elfego Baca.

==Geography==

Reserve is located in western Catron County in the valley of the San Francisco River. New Mexico State Road 12 passes through the village, leading west to U.S. Route 180 near Reserve Airport and northeast to U.S. Route 60 at Datil. NM 435 leads south through the communities of San Francisco Plaza and Lower San Francisco Plaza before ending south of Reserve.

Reserve is situated in the Gila National Forest about east of the Arizona/New Mexico border. The area includes ruins from the Mogollon and Anasazi tribes, as well as petroglyphs and historic Old West sites.

== Climate ==
Reserve has a Mediterranean climate of the warm-summer type (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;), unusual in New Mexico. Despite having mild to hot daytime highs year round, temperatures substantially cool off during nighttime due to Reserve&#x27;s high elevation and aridity. Even in the summertime, 90 degree days can cool off into the 40&#x27;s. A freeze has been recorded every month of the year except August. Reserve receives most of its rainfall in the form of thunderstorms from mid-summer into fall from the North American Monsoon, which can produce hazardous flash floods very quickly. Snow usually falls once or twice a year, but melts quickly due to the high daytime temperatures.

==Education==
The city is served by the Reserve Independent School District.

==Reserve prehistoric pottery==
This Ancestral Pueblo pottery type was named for the Reserve area, where it was first found, and is a major subdivision of the Cibola Whiteware group. Common designs are opposed solid and hatched motifs that are interlocked with each other. Usually the hatching is diagonal, but parallel hatching in late examples occurs as well. Squiggle hatching may occur on some early examples. Usually the hatched motifs average two to four times as wide as the solid motifs but occasionally approach the same size. Framing and hatching lines are usually the same width. &quot;Bulls eyes&quot; are common in Reserve Black-on-White.

==Badge-factory==
Since the enactment of the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act in 2004, &quot;qualified law enforcement officer&quot; and “qualified retired or separated law enforcement officer&quot; have been given permission to carry a concealed firearm in any jurisdiction in the United States, regardless of state or local laws, with certain exceptions. In 2018, it was revealed that billionaire Robert Mercer (owner of Breitbart News, Cambridge Analytica, and others) was a volunteer policeman with Lake Arthur Police Department from 2011. This enrollment permitted him to carry a concealed weapon in all 50 states. Mercer also obtained police badges (old-fashioned stars) for bodyguards working for the Koch brothers and Breitbart news. The police department was shut down in April 2018 after these &quot;badges-for-cash&quot; were reported in the media.

<text>Grants is a city in Cibola County, New Mexico, United States. It is located about west of Albuquerque. The population was 9,163 at the 2020 Census. It is the county seat of Cibola County.

Grants is located along the Trails of the Ancients Byway, one of the designated New Mexico Scenic Byways.

==History==
Grants began as a railroad camp in the 1880s, when three Canadian brothers – Angus A. Grant, John R. Grant, and Lewis A. Grant – were awarded a contract to build a section of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad through the region. The Grant brothers&#x27; camp was first called Grants Camp, then Grants Station, and finally Grants. The new city enveloped the existing colonial New Mexican settlement of Los Alamitos and grew along the tracks of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad.

The town prospered from railroad logging in the nearby Zuni Mountains, and it was a section point for the Atlantic and Pacific, which became part of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The Zuni Mountain Railroad short line had a roundhouse in town (near Exit 81 off Interstate 40) and housed workers in a small community named Breecetown. Timber from the Zuni Mountains was shipped to Albuquerque, where a large sawmill converted the timber to wood products that were sold across the west.

After the decline of logging in the 1930s, Grants-Milan gained fame as the &quot;carrot capital&quot; of the United States. Agriculture was aided by the creation of Bluewater Reservoir, and the region&#x27;s volcanic soils provided ideal conditions for farming. Grants also benefited from its location as airway beacon and later by U.S. Route 66, which brought travelers and tourists, and the businesses that catered to them. the beacon and FSS building on the airport (KGNT) was being restored as the Western New Mexico Aviation Heritage Museum.

Perhaps the town&#x27;s most memorable boom occurred when Paddy Martinez, a Navajo shepherd, discovered uranium ore near Haystack Mesa, sparking a mining boom that lasted until the 1980s (see Uranium mining in New Mexico). The collapse of mining pulled the town into a depression, but the town has enjoyed a resurgence based on interest in tourism and the scenic beauty of the region. Recent interest in nuclear power has revived the possibility of more uranium mining in the area, and energy companies still own viable mining properties and claims in the area.

==Geography==
Grants is located in north-central Cibola County. Santa Fe Avenue (former Route 66) is the main road through the city, while Interstate 40 passes through the south side of the city, with access from exits 81 and 85.

Grants is on the north end of the large and recent (youngest flows around 3,000 years old) lava field known as &quot;El Malpais&quot; (&quot;the badlands&quot;), part of which is preserved as El Malpais National Monument. To the northeast of town are the San Mateo Mountains and Mount Taylor, at the highest peak in the region. West of the city is the Continental Divide and the Zuni Mountains, an eroded anticline with 2-billion-year-old Precambrian granites and metamorphic rocks at its core. The region is primarily high desert country, dominated by sandstones and lava flows.

<doc id="125847" wikidata="Q2019530" url="?curid=125847" title="Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire">
<text>Deborah Vivien Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, (born Deborah Vivien Freeman-Mitford and latterly Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire; 31 March 1920 – 24 September 2014), was an English aristocrat, writer, memoirist, and socialite. She was the youngest and last surviving of the six Mitford sisters, who were prominent members of British society in the 1930s and 1940s.

==Life==
Known to her family as &quot;Debo&quot;, Deborah Vivien Freeman-Mitford was born in Kensington, London, on 31 March 1920. Her parents were David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale (1878–1958), son of Bertram Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale, and his wife, Sydney (1880–1963), daughter of Thomas Gibson Bowles, MP. She married Lord Andrew Cavendish, younger son of the 10th Duke of Devonshire, in 1941. When Cavendish&#x27;s older brother, William, Marquess of Hartington, was killed in action in 1944, Cavendish became heir to the dukedom and began to use the courtesy title Marquess of Hartington. In 1950, on the death of his father, the Marquess of Hartington became the 11th Duke of Devonshire.

Cavendish was the main public face of Chatsworth for many decades. She wrote several books about Chatsworth, and played a key role in the restoration of the house, the enhancement of the garden and the development of commercial activities such as Chatsworth Farm Shop (which is on a quite different scale from most farm shops, as it employs a hundred people); Chatsworth&#x27;s other retail and catering operations; and assorted offshoots such as Chatsworth Food (later Chatsworth Estate Trading), which sold luxury foodstuffs carrying her signature; and Chatsworth Design, which sells image rights to items and designs from the Chatsworth collections. Recognising the commercial imperatives of running a stately home, she took a very active role and was known to man the Chatsworth House ticket office herself. She also supervised the development of the Cavendish Hotel at Baslow, near Chatsworth, and the Devonshire Arms Hotel at Bolton Abbey.

In 1999, Cavendish was appointed a Dame Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (DCVO) by Queen Elizabeth II, for her service to the Royal Collection Trust. Upon the death of her husband in 2004, her son Peregrine Cavendish became the 12th Duke of Devonshire. She became the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire at this time, and moved into a smaller house on the Chatsworth estate.

Towards the end of her life, she formed a friendship with Arthur Parkinson, the future gardening author and broadcaster, bonding over their shared interest in hens.

==Children==
She and the duke had seven children, four of whom died shortly after birth:
* Mark Cavendish (born and died 14 November 1941)
* Lady Emma Cavendish (born 26 March 1943), married Hon. Tobias William Tennant, son of the 2nd Lord Glenconner, in 1963 and has three children (including model Stella Tennant).
* Peregrine Andrew Morny Cavendish, 12th Duke of Devonshire (born 27 April 1944)
* An unnamed child (miscarried December 1946; the child was a twin of Victor Cavendish, born in 1947)
* Lord Victor Cavendish (born and died 22 May 1947)
* Lady Mary Cavendish (born and died 5 April 1953)
* Lady Sophia Louise Sydney Cavendish (born 18 March 1957), married, firstly, Anthony William Lindsay Murphy in 1979, divorced 1987. In 1988 she married secondly Alastair Morrison, 3rd Baron Margadale, son of James Morrison, 2nd Baron Margadale, with whom she had two children. Following divorce she married, thirdly, William Topley in 1999.

== Relatives ==
She was a maternal aunt of Max Mosley, former president of the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), as well as the grandmother of fashion model Stella Tennant (1970–2020) and aristocrat William Cavendish, Earl of Burlington.

==Politics==
In 1981 she and her husband joined the new Social Democratic Party.

==Death==
Cavendish died from complications of dementia in Edensor on 24 September 2014, at the age of 94. Her funeral was held on 2 October 2014 at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Edensor. Mourners included the then Prince of Wales (later Charles III) and his wife, Camilla, then-Duchess of Cornwall.

* 1920–1941 – The Honourable Deborah Freeman-Mitford
* 1941–1944 – Lady Andrew Cavendish

==Selected interviews==
Cavendish was interviewed on her experience of sitting for a portrait for painter Lucian Freud in the BBC series &quot;Imagine&quot; in 2004.

In an interview with John Preston of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, published in September 2007, she recounted having tea with Adolf Hitler during a visit to Munich in June 1937, when she was visiting Germany with her mother and her sister Unity, the latter being the only one of the three who spoke German and, therefore the one who carried on the entire conversation with Hitler. Shortly before ending the interview, Preston asked her to choose with whom she would have preferred to have tea: American singer Elvis Presley or Hitler. Looking at the interviewer with astonishment, she answered: &quot;Well, Elvis of course! What an extraordinary question.&quot;

In 2010, the BBC journalist Kirsty Wark interviewed the Duchess for &quot;Newsnight&quot;. In it, the Duchess talked about life in the 1930s and 1940s, Hitler, the Chatsworth estate, and the marginalisation of the upper classes. She was also interviewed on 23 December by Charlie Rose for PBS.

On 10 November 2010, she was interviewed as part of &quot;The Artists, Poets, and Writers Lecture Series&quot; sponsored by the Frick Collection, an interview which focused on her memoir and her published correspondence with Patrick Leigh Fermor.

==Education==
Pine Hill is the location of the Pine Hill Schools, a tribal school operated by the Ramah Navajo School Board.

Many children also attend the public schools in Ramah, New Mexico, including Ramah Elementary School and Ramah Middle/High School, operated by the Gallup-McKinley County Schools. The proximity of the nearest schools in Cibola County were so far, away, that Cibola and McKinley counties agreed to have students sent to McKinley County schools. The reservation is physically within Grants/Cibola County Schools; however few children attend them from Pine Hill, since there is no school bus service to these schools from Pine Hill.

===History of education===
Historically Native students in the reservation attended Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) boarding schools in New Mexico and other states. The BIA opened a Kindergarten through grade 3 day school, Mountain View Day School, on the reservation in 1943. It had an enrollment of 30 students at the start. A dormitory in Ramah Village, which had the nearest school district-operated public schools, opened in 1954, and Mountain View closed.

The Ramah Village public high school closed circa 1968, due to being condemned. At first secondary students were forced to attend distant BIA boarding schools as the dormitory in Ramah now only took elementary students, and the Gallup-McKinley school district did not bus to other public schools. The Navajo Legal System Program (DNA) sued the school district in August 1968 in an attempt to reopen the public school. The courts ruled that the reservation could have busing to the public schools in Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico (including Zuni High School), but the Gallup-McKinley County district chose to not allow its buses to enter Cibolo County, which contained the reservation. Therefore, the Ramah Navajo Indian School Board was established in 1970 and established a plan to open a tribal school, which it did in the ex-Ramah School in 1970; the tribal school moved to Pine Hill in 1975. In 1983 the Ramah Village public high school reopened.

In Summer 1994 the Ramah tribal government and the governments of Cibola County and McKinley County agreed to have two bus stops on the Ramah reservation, neither at Pinehill, but after parental outcry, a stop was established across from Pine Hill schools, and it began operation effective in December 1994. In January 1995 the Ramah Navajo chapter and the associated Ramah Navajo School Board, which operates Pine Hill Schools, sued the New Mexico Public Education Department and the Gallup McKinley County Schools arguing that the defendants breached the tribe&#x27;s sovereignty by allowing the school district to extend school bus services further into the tribal grounds and therefore taking students who would have attended Pine Hill Schools and violating the previous agreement between the tribe and the counties.

<text>Cimarron is a village in Colfax County, New Mexico, United States, which sits on the eastern slopes of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The population was 792 at the 2020 census, making it the fourth most populous municipality in Colfax County.

Cimarron sits on the Cimarron River, a tributary of the 900 mile-long Canadian River, whose headwaters are at the Eagle Nest Dam, with the main part of town lying along U.S. Route 64. The village is surrounded on all sides by numerous ranches, including Philmont Scout Ranch, an extensive &quot;high-adventure base&quot; operated by the Boy Scouts of America. Philmont is located just four miles south of Cimarron. Other ranches also include the Chase Ranch (famous for its heart-shaped brand and allegedly the Marlboro Man&#x27;s place of origin), Ted Turner&#x27;s Vermejo Park Ranch, the CS Ranch, the Express UU Bar Ranch (formerly the property of Waite Phillips), and the Clearview Ranch of the western singer/songwriter R.W. Hampton, as well as numerous other small ranches. The Elliott Barker State Wildlife Area, the Valle Vidal unit of the Carson National Forest, and Cimarron Canyon State Park., are also located within the Cimarron area. 17 miles and 28 miles to the northeast is Dawson, New Mexico, a ghost town with a population of over 9,000 near the early 20th century, and the Raton Municipal Airport, respectively.

The village is a pioneer of the four-day school week (MondayThursday), which it originally implemented in the early 1970s, during a time of rising fuel and utility prices. Cimarron is home to the 1979 New Mexico High School Boys Basketball State Championship team.

==History==

Cimarron is located on the land of what became known as the Maxwell Land Grant. In 1842, Lucien B. Maxwell, a fur trapper, came to the Beaubien-Miranda Ranch in northern New Mexico and courted and married Luz Beaubien, one of the owner&#x27;s six daughters. He eventually inherited the ranch and built a mansion in 1858 on the future town site.

Maxwell built the Aztec Mill in 1864. It is preserved as the Old Mill Museum, operated by the Cimarron Historical Society. The museum&#x27;s collection includes working mill parts; Native American tools, weapons and pottery; Maxwell Land Grant paperwork and documents; and other materials.

Cimarron was officially chartered in 1859 and was named for the Spanish word used to describe a mustang, meaning &quot;wild&quot; or &quot;unbroken&quot;. Cimarron was the county seat of Colfax County beginning in 1872, when it replaced Elizabethtown. At that time, Cimarron was a stage stop on the Mountain Branch of the Santa Fe Trail. In 1881, the county seat was moved to Springer, a town on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. It was during this time that Lucien Maxwell, due to rising tensions, sold the Maxwell Land Grant to a group of investors, with the resultant Colfax County War in which more than two hundred people were killed.

In 1905, the St. Louis, Rocky Mountain, and Pacific Railway Co. laid tracks from Raton to Ute Park, with the intent to haul coal between Raton and Cimarron. Passengers used the daily train service, as well as ranchers who moved agricultural animals. During World War II, the tracks were removed, with the steel to be recycled to help with the shortage during the war effort.

Soon after the tracks were laid through town, tracks were also laid 22 miles up Ponil Canyon by the Cimarron and Northwestern Railway Company, to haul timber from the surrounding mountains, which were loaded with douglas fir and ponderosa pine. The railroad company delivered its timber to the Continental Tie and Lumber Company, located in Cimarron, NM, who made railroad ties and timber supports for nearby coal mines.

Cimarron continues to thrive, in part due to its proximity to Philmont Scout Ranch, as well as summer tourism.

As a tribute to many dedicated crew members, the USS &quot;Cimarron&#x27;s&quot; key artifacts were donated to Cimarron, since it is the closest village to the Cimarron River Basin&#x27;s Headwaters. The ship&#x27;s bell now stands in front of the village&#x27;s high school, Cimarron High School.

==Geography==
Cimarron is located in west-central Colfax County on the north bank of the Cimarron River, where it emerges from the Cimarron Range of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. U.S. Route 64 passes through the village, leading west up the Cimarron Canyon to Eagle Nest and northeast to Raton, the Colfax County seat. New Mexico State Road 58 leads east from Cimarron to Interstate 25, north of Springer.

The city is also located about 6.5 miles south of the New Mexico–Colorado border and 85 miles west of Texas. At the 2020 census, its population was 6,041.

==History==

&quot;Ratón&quot; is Spanish for mouse.

Raton Pass had been used by Spanish explorers and Native Americans for centuries to cut through the rugged Rocky Mountains, and the mountain branch of the Santa Fe Trail cuts through the city, along what is now Business I-25.

The post office at this location was named Willow Springs from 1877 to 1879, Otero from 1879 to 1880, then renamed Raton in 1880.

Raton was founded at the site of Willow Springs, a stop on the Santa Fe Trail. The original for the Raton townsite were purchased from the Maxwell Land Grant in 1880. In 1879, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway bought a local toll road and established a busy rail line. Raton quickly developed as a railroad, mining, and ranching center for the northeast part of the New Mexico territory, as well as the county seat and principal trading center of the area.

===Geology===
The Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, also known as the K-Pg or K-T boundary, or the iridium layer, can be viewed in Raton. A well-preserved sequence of rocks spans the K-T boundary in Climax Canyon Park in Raton. The rocks have been studied for evidence of the iridium anomaly cited as evidence of a large meteorite impact at the end of the Cretaceous. It is interpreted to have caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which killed off dinosaurs and many other species of flora and fauna 66 million years ago.

<text>Diana, Lady Mosley (&quot;née&quot; Mitford; 17 June 1910 – 11 August 2003), known as Diana Guinness between 1929 and 1936, was a British aristocrat, writer, editor and fascist sympathiser. She was one of the Mitford sisters and the wife of Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists.

She was Initially married to Bryan Guinness, heir to the barony of Moyne, and both were part of the Bright Young Things, a social group of young Bohemian socialites in 1920s London. Her marriage ended in divorce as she was pursuing a relationship with Oswald Mosley. In 1936, she married Mosley at the home of the propaganda minister for Nazi Germany, Joseph Goebbels, with Adolf Hitler as guest of honour. Her involvement with fascist political causes resulted in three years&#x27; internment during the Second World War, when Britain was at war with the fascist regime of Nazi Germany. She later moved to Paris and enjoyed some success as a writer. In the 1950s, she contributed diaries to &quot;Tatler&quot; and edited the magazine &quot;The European&quot;. In 1977, she published her autobiography, &quot;A Life of Contrasts&quot;, and two more biographies in the 1980s.

Mosley&#x27;s 1989 appearance on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; was controversial due to her Holocaust denial and admiration of Hitler. She was also a regular book reviewer for &quot;Books and Bookmen&quot; and later at &quot;The Evening Standard&quot; in the 1990s. A family friend, James Lees-Milne, wrote of her beauty, &quot;She was the nearest thing to Botticelli&#x27;s Venus that I have ever seen&quot;. She was described by obituary writers such as the historian Andrew Roberts as &quot;unrepentant&quot; about her previous political associations.

==Early life==
Diana Mitford was the fourth child and third daughter of David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale (1878–1958), and his wife Sydney (1880–1963). She was a first cousin once removed of Clementine Churchill, second cousin of Sir Angus Ogilvy, and first cousin, twice removed, of Bertrand Russell. She was raised in the country estate of Batsford Park, Gloucestershire, then from the age of 10 at the family home, Asthall Manor in Oxfordshire, and later at Swinbrook House, a home her father had built in the nearby village of Swinbrook.

She was educated at home by a series of governesses, except for a six-month period in 1926, when she was sent to a day school in Paris. In childhood, her younger sisters Jessica Mitford (&quot;Decca&quot;) and Deborah (&quot;Debo&quot;, later the Duchess of Devonshire), were particularly devoted to her. At the age of 18, shortly after her presentation at Court, she became secretly engaged to Bryan Guinness. In her youth, Mitford was considered part of the social set known as &#x27;The Bright Young Things&#x27;.

==Marriages==

Guinness, an Irish aristocrat, writer and brewing heir, would inherit the barony of Moyne. Diana&#x27;s parents were opposed to the engagement but in time were persuaded; Sydney was particularly uneasy at the thought of two such young people having possession of such a large fortune, but she was eventually convinced Bryan was a suitable husband. They married on 30 January 1929; her sisters Jessica and Deborah were too ill to attend the ceremony. The couple had an income of £20,000 a year, an estate at Biddesden in Wiltshire, and houses in London and Dublin. They were well known for hosting social events involving the Bright Young People. The writer Evelyn Waugh exclaimed that her beauty &quot;ran through the room like a peal of bells&quot;, and he dedicated the novel &quot;Vile Bodies&quot; to her. Portraits of her were painted by Augustus John, Pavel Tchelitchew and Henry Lamb. She was one of a series of society beauties photographed as classical figures by Madame Yevonde. The couple had two sons, Jonathan (born 1930) and Desmond (1931–2020).
In February 1932, Diana met Sir Oswald Mosley at a garden party at the home of the society hostess Emerald Cunard. He soon became leader of the newly formed British Union of Fascists and Diana became his lover; Mosley was then married to Lady Cynthia Mosley, a daughter of Lord Curzon, a former Viceroy of India, and his first wife, the American mercantile heiress Mary Victoria Leiter. Diana left her husband, &quot;moving with a skeleton staff of nanny, cook, house-parlourmaid and lady&#x27;s maid to a house at 2 Eaton Square, round the corner from Mosley&#x27;s flat&quot;, but Sir Oswald would not leave his wife. Quite suddenly, Cynthia died in 1933 of peritonitis. Mosley was devastated by the death of his wife, but later started an affair with her younger sister, Lady Alexandra Metcalfe.

Mitford&#x27;s parents did not approve of her decision to leave Guinness for Mosley, and she was briefly estranged from most of her family. Her affair and eventual marriage to Mosley also strained relationships with her sisters. Jessica and Deborah were initially not permitted to see Diana, for she was &quot;living in sin&quot; with Mosley in London. Deborah eventually came to know Mosley and ended up liking him very much. Jessica despised Mosley&#x27;s beliefs and became permanently estranged from Diana in the later 1930s. Pam and her husband Derek Jackson got along well with Mosley. Nancy never liked Mosley and, like Jessica, despised his political beliefs, but was able to learn to tolerate him for the sake of her relationship with Diana. Nancy wrote the novel &quot;Wigs on the Green&quot;, which satirised Mosley and his beliefs. After it was published in 1935, relations between the sisters became strained-to-non-existent and it was not until the mid-1940s that they were able to get back to being close again.

The couple rented Wootton Lodge, a country house in Staffordshire that Diana had intended to buy. She furnished much of her new home with much of the Swinbrook furniture that her father was selling. The Mosleys lived at Wootton Lodge along with their children from 1936 to 1939.

== Nazi Germany ==
In 1934, Diana visited Germany with her then 19-year-old sister Unity. While there, they attended the first Nuremberg rally after the Nazi rise to power. Unity, a friend of Hitler, introduced Diana to him in March 1935. They returned for the second rally later that year and were entertained as his guests at the 1935 rally. In 1936, he provided a Mercedes-Benz to chauffeur Diana to the Berlin Olympic games. She became well acquainted with Winifred Wagner and Magda Goebbels.

Diana and Oswald secretly married on 6 October 1936 in the drawing room of Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels. Adolf Hitler, Robert Gordon-Canning and Bill Allen were in attendance. The marriage was kept secret until the birth of their first child in 1938. In August 1939, Hitler told Diana over lunch that war was inevitable.

Mosley and Diana had two sons: (Oswald) Alexander Mosley (born 1938) and Max Rufus Mosley (1940–2021). Hitler presented the couple with a silver framed picture of himself. The Mosleys were interned during much of the Second World War, under Defence Regulation 18B, along with other British fascists including Norah Elam.

MI5 documents released in 2002 described Lady Mosley and her political leanings. &quot;Diana Mosley, wife of Sir Oswald Mosley, is reported on the &#x27;best authority&#x27;, that of her family and intimate circle, to be a public danger at the present time. Is said to be far cleverer and more dangerous than her husband and will stick at nothing to achieve her ambitions. She is wildly ambitious.&quot; On 29 June 1940, eleven weeks after the birth of her fourth son, Max, Diana was arrested (hastily stuffing Hitler&#x27;s photograph under Max&#x27;s cot mattress when the police came to arrest her) and taken to a cell in F Block in London&#x27;s Holloway Prison for women. She and her husband were held without charge or trial under the provisions of 18B, on the advice of MI5. The couple were initially held separately but, after personal intervention by Churchill, in December 1941, Mosley and two other 18B husbands (one of them Mosley&#x27;s friend Captain H. W. Luttman-Johnson) were permitted to join their wives at Holloway. After more than three years&#x27; imprisonment, they were both released in November 1943 on the grounds of Mosley&#x27;s ill health; they were placed under house arrest until the end of the war and were denied passports until 1949.

Lady Mosley&#x27;s prison time failed to disturb her approach to life; she remarked in her later years that she felt better treated than earlier prisoners.

According to an anecdote in her &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; obituary, Evelyn Waugh saw Lady Mosley wear a diamond swastika brooch among her jewels as she left prison.

==Post-war==
After the war ended, the couple kept homes in Ireland, with apartments in London and Paris. Their recently renovated Clonfert home, a former Bishop&#x27;s palace, burned down in an accidental fire. In her memoirs, Diana blamed her cook, writing that the fire could have been extinguished had it not been for the cook who ran back to her room to retrieve her possessions and in doing so delayed efforts to control the fire. Following this, they moved to a home near Fermoy, County Cork, later settling permanently in France, at the Temple de la Gloire, a Palladian temple in Orsay, southwest of Paris, in 1950 (built in 1801 to honour the French victory of December 1800 at Hohenlinden, near Munich). Gaston and Bettina Bergery had told the Mosleys that the property was on the market. They were neighbours of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who lived in the neighbouring town Gif-sur-Yvette, and soon became their close friends.

Once again they became known for entertaining, but were barred from all functions at the British Embassy. During their time in France, the Mosleys quietly went through another marriage ceremony; Hitler had safeguarded their original marriage licence, and it was never found after the war. During this period, Mosley was unfaithful to Diana, but she found for the most part that she was able to learn to keep herself from getting too upset regarding his adulterous habits. She told an interviewer: &quot;I think if you&#x27;re going to mind infidelity, you better call it a day as far as marriage goes. Because who has ever remained faithful? I mean, they don&#x27;t. There&#x27;s passion and that&#x27;s it.&quot; Diana was also a lifelong supporter of the British Union of Fascists (BUF), and its postwar successor the Union Movement.

At times, she was vague when discussing her loyalties to Britain, her strong belief in fascism, and her attitude to Jews. In her 1977 autobiography &quot;A Life of Contrasts&quot;, she wrote, &quot;I didn&#x27;t love Hitler any more than I did Winston [Churchill]. I can&#x27;t regret it, it was so interesting.&quot; In her final interviews with Duncan Fallowell in 2002, she responded that her reaction to the newsreels of death camps was &quot;Well, of course, horror. Utter horror. Exactly the same probably as your reactions.&quot; However, when asked about having revulsion against Hitler for this, she said that &quot;I had a complete revulsion against the people who did it but I could never efface from my memory the man I had actually experienced before the war. A very complicated feeling. I can&#x27;t really relate those two things to each other. I know I&#x27;m not supposed to say that but I just have to.&quot; At other times, however, she behaved so as to suggest intense anti-semitic attitudes; the journalist Paul Callan remembered mentioning that he was Jewish while interviewing her husband in Diana&#x27;s presence. According to Callan, &quot;I mentioned, just in the course of conversation, that I was Jewish—at which Lady Mosley went ashen, snapped a crimson nail and left the room ... No explanation was given but she would later write to a friend: &#x27;A nice, polite reporter came to interview Tom [as Mosley was known] but he turned out to be Jewish and was sitting there at our table. They are a very clever race and come in all shapes and sizes.&#x27;&quot; Diana offered to entertain her teenage half-Jewish nephew, Benjamin Treuhaft, on a trip to France. The offer was refused by Benjamin&#x27;s mother, Jessica, who remained estranged from Diana over the latter&#x27;s political past. In a 2000 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Diana said that &quot;Maybe instead they [European Jews] could have gone somewhere like Uganda: very empty and a lovely climate&quot; (a reference to the Uganda Scheme proposed by Zionists in 1903).

Her appearance on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; with Sue Lawley in 1989 remains controversial due to Mosley&#x27;s Holocaust denial and admiration of Hitler. Mosley told Lawley that she had not believed the extermination of Jews by Nazi Germany until &quot;years&quot; after the war, and that she thought the official death figure of six million Jewish victims was too high. The broadcast of this episode had to be rescheduled several times because it kept coinciding with Jewish holidays and prompted hundreds of complaints to the BBC. In 2016, a writer at the BBC described it as the most controversial of all &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; episodes. Her choices of music to be played on Desert Island Discs were: Symphony No. 41 (Mozart), &quot;Casta Diva&quot; from &quot;Norma&quot; (Bellini), &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; (Beethoven), &quot;Die Walküre&quot; (Wagner), &quot;Liebestod&quot; (Wagner), &quot;L&#x27;amour est un oiseau rebelle&quot; from &quot;Carmen&quot; (Bizet), &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; (Procol Harum) and Polonaise in F-sharp minor (Chopin).

After their early twenties, Diana and her sister Jessica only saw each other once, when they met for half an hour as their elder sister, Nancy, lay dying in Versailles. Diana said of Jessica in 1996: &quot;I quite honestly don&#x27;t mind what Decca [Jessica] says or thinks,&quot; adding that &quot;She means absolutely nothing to me at all. Not because she&#x27;s a Communist but simply because she&#x27;s a rather boring person, really.&quot;

In 1998, due to her advancing age, she moved out of the Temple de la Gloire and into an apartment in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. Temple de la Gloire was sold in 2000 for £1 million. Throughout much of her life, particularly after her years in prison, she was afflicted by regular bouts of migraines. In 1981, she underwent successful surgery to remove a brain tumour. She convalesced at Chatsworth House, the residence of her sister Deborah. In the early 1990s, she was also successfully treated for skin cancer. In later life, she also suffered from deafness.

Mosley attended the funeral of René de Chambrun, the son-in-law of Vichy France Prime Minister Pierre Laval, in 2002.

==Writer==
Mosley was shunned in the British media for a period after the war, and the couple established their own publishing company, Euphorion Books, named after a character in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;. This allowed Oswald to publish, and Diana was free to commission a cultural list. After his release from jail, Oswald declared the death of fascism. Diana initially translated Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;. Other notable books published by Euphorion under her aegis included &quot;La Princesse de Clèves&quot; (translated by Nancy, 1950), Niki Lauda&#x27;s memoirs (1985), and Hans-Ulrich Rudel&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;Stuka Pilot&quot;. She also edited several of her husband&#x27;s books.

While in France, Mosley edited the fascist cultural magazine &quot;The European&quot; for six years, and to which she sometimes contributed material. She provided articles, book reviews, and regular diary entries. Many of her contributions were republished in 2008 in &quot;The Pursuit of Laughter&quot;. In 1965, she was commissioned to write the regular column &quot;Letters from Paris&quot; for &quot;Tatler&quot;. She reviewed autobiographical and biographical accounts as well as the occasional novel. Characteristically she would provide commentary of her own experiences and personal information of the subject of the book under discussion. She wrote regularly for &quot;Books and Bookmen&quot;. Her 1980 review of a biography on Magda Goebbels attracted attention from Christopher Hitchens. Hitchens objected to a passage where Mosley wrote: &quot;Everyone knows the tragic end. As the Russians surrounded Berlin, the Goebbels painlessly killed their children and then themselves. The dead children were described by people who saw them as looking &#x27;peacefully asleep&#x27;. Those who condemn this appalling, Masada-like deed must consider the alternative facing the distraught Magda.&quot; Hitchens insisted that the &quot;New Statesman&quot; issue an editorial condemning the Masada trope. In her eighties, Mosley became the lead reviewer for the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; during A. N. Wilson&#x27;s seven-year tenure as literary editor. In 1996, following Wilson&#x27;s departure, his successor was asked by the new editor of the newspaper, Max Hastings to stop running Mosley&#x27;s reviews. Hastings is reported to have said that he did not want any more &quot;bloody Lady Hitler&quot; in the newspaper.

Mosley wrote the foreword and introduction of &quot;Nancy Mitford: A Memoir&quot; by Harold Acton. She produced her own two books of memoirs: &quot;A Life of Contrasts&quot; (1977, Hamish Hamilton), and &quot;Loved Ones&quot; (1985). The latter is a collection of pen portraits of close relatives and friends such as the writer Evelyn Waugh among others. In 1980, she released &quot;The Duchess of Windsor&quot;, a biography.

In 2007, letters between the Mitford sisters, including communications to and from Diana, were published in the compilation &quot;The Mitfords: Letters Between Six Sisters&quot;, edited by Charlotte Mosley. A following collection consisting of her letters, articles, diaries and reviews was released as &quot;The Pursuit of Laughter&quot; in December 2008.

==Death==
Mosley died in Paris in August 2003, aged 93. Her cause of death was given as complications related to a stroke she had suffered a week earlier, but reports later surfaced that she had been one of the many elderly fatalities of the heat wave of 2003 in mostly non-air-conditioned Paris. She was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Churchyard, Swinbrook, Oxfordshire, alongside her sisters.

She was survived by her four sons: Jonathan and Desmond Guinness, and Alexander and Max Mosley. Her stepson Nicholas Mosley was a novelist who also wrote a critical memoir of his father for which Mosley reportedly never forgave him, despite their previously close relationship. A great-granddaughter, Jasmine Guinness, a great-niece, Stella Tennant and a granddaughter, Daphne Guinness are models.

British journalist Andrew Roberts criticised Mosley following her death in the pages of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; (16 August 2003), reporting that when he interviewed her for his book &quot;Eminent Churchillians&quot;, she had surprised him by not serving up a &quot;David Irving-style refutation&quot; of the Holocaust by declaring &quot;I&#x27;m sure he [Hitler] was to blame for the extermination of the Jews. He was to blame for everything, and I say that as someone who approved of him.&quot; However, her other remarks about Hitler showed the lifelong &quot;same disdain for equivocation&quot; she had always displayed, prompting him to call her an &quot;unrepentant Nazi and effortlessly charming&quot;, and her views &quot;disgusting, unchanged&quot; and &quot;repulsive&quot;. A. N. Wilson wrote for the same newspaper and said that her public loyalty for Oswald and Hitler were disastrous mistakes, claiming that privately Mosley had admitted that the Nazis were &quot;really rather awful&quot;. Three days later, letters to the editor from both her son, Jonathan Guinness, Lord Moyne, and his daughter (her granddaughter), Daphne Guinness, attempted to refute Roberts&#x27; statements by citing her &quot;lack of hypocrisy&quot;, claiming Mosley&#x27;s &quot;upper-class etiquette&quot; would prohibit giving any sort of explanation or an apology to a journalist, and that regardless of her giving a Hitler salute during the singing of &quot;God Save The King&quot; in 1935, she was never a threat to wartime Britain.

A sarcastic commentary by Canadian columnist Mark Steyn appeared in the same issue. He described Mosley’s unwavering allegiance to Hitler and fascism as that of &quot;a silly kid&quot;. An equally &quot;indulgently dismissive attitude&quot; of her opinions was seconded in the Sunday edition in an interview with her stepson Nicholas Mosley, with whom she had refused to speak for over two decades after the publication of &quot;Beyond the Pale&quot;, his unfavorable memoir of her husband.

== In literature and film ==
Mosley inspired the protagonist of the 2018 novel &quot;After the Party&quot; by Cressida Connolly. She is portrayed extensively in the sixth and final season of &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot; by Amber Anderson.

The town was the county seat of Colfax County from 1882—1897 and keeps the former Courthouse as a museum. The location was chosen due to anticipation of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway coming and as it was halfway between the Mountain Branch and Cimarron Cutoff of the Santa Fe Trail.

<text>Clovis is a city in and the county seat of Curry County, New Mexico. The population was 38,567 at the 2020 census. Clovis is located in the New Mexico portion of the Llano Estacado, in the eastern part of the state.

A largely agricultural community, closely bordering Texas, it is noted for its role in early rock music history and for nearby Cannon Air Force Base, current home to the 27th Special Operations Wing which is also known as &quot;The Steadfast Line&quot;. A Paleo-Indian site was found near Clovis, where in 1929 a distinctive kind of stone spear-point was discovered. These points were called Clovis points, and the culture associated with them was named the Clovis culture. The Clovis people were early inhabitants who created a widespread culture in the New World. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway system helped establish Clovis over one hundred years ago, which continues to be a major hub of operations for that railroad and its successor, BNSF Railway. Also notable is the Southwest Cheese Company, the largest cheddar cheese producer in North America.

It is the principal city of the Clovis Micropolitan statistical area, which is part of the larger Clovis-Portales CSA.

==Prehistory==
The Eastern New Mexico region was home to the prehistoric Clovis culture, an anthropologically significant group of early Native Americans. Several remains have been found at the Blackwater Draw site (south of Clovis, near Portales), which remains a historical and tourist site.

==Rail history==
Clovis began in 1906, when the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway was being constructed through the area and railway engineers were instructed to &quot;locate and buy the first level section of land west of Texico&quot; on which to build a town site and railroad facilities.

At first known as &quot;Riley&#x27;s Switch&quot;, the site was renamed Clovis. A likely-apocryphal story states that a daughter of a rail official (accounts vary whether her father was AT&amp;SF president Edward Payson Ripley, chief engineer James Dunn, or an unnamed station master) was studying about Clovis, the first Christian king of the Franks, and proposed the name.

==Town history==
The land was bought on October 2, 1906, and the railroad began offering town lots for sale on May 1, 1907. The settlement built up quickly and in 1909 was incorporated.

On August 24, 2008, eight prisoners escaped from the Clovis Jail by shimmying up plumbing pipes. The escape was highlighted on the television show &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;.

Clovis celebrated its centennial in 2009.

The Clovis Carver Public Library was the site of a mass shooting in August 2017 in which two people were killed and four wounded.

In 2023, the FW1 Ute Reservoir pipeline project started construction to provide potable water by 2030 for Cannon Air Force Base and the communities of Clovis, Portales, Elida, and Texico.

==Geography==
Clovis is located in southeastern Curry County at (34.4047987, -103.2052272), west of the Texas border. The city&#x27;s geographic center is at an elevation of above sea level.

U.S. Routes 60, 70, and 84 pass through the city. US 60 and 84 lead west to Fort Sumner, while US 70 leads southwest to Portales and to Roswell. The three highways lead east together to the state line at Texico, New Mexico, and Farwell, Texas. Cannon Air Force Base is west of the center of Clovis.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.73% is water from the several artificial ponds in Clovis&#x27; multiple public parks.

===Climate===

The climate is relatively temperate with low humidity and high winds. Summers are warm with occasional extreme heat and winters are cool with frequent, extreme cold. Severe thunderstorms are often in the spring with rainstorms prevalent during summer evenings. Tornadoes are known to occur and Clovis is located on the southern edge of Tornado Alley. Several inches of snowfall frequently occur each winter, typically for several weeks in January–February, often resulting in minor flooding due to the non-existent runoff system. High winds are common due to the flat, open land and regularly gust well above and average . According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Clovis has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

==Economics and industry==


Like most of east-central New Mexico and western Texas, the surrounding area plays host to significant agriculture and ranching activities, including peanut and cotton farming and cattle ranching used for both meat and dairy production. Several processing plants exist for these products; in 2004 construction began on the Southwest Cheese Company plant between Clovis and Portales. The plant commenced operations in late 2005 and provided a small boost to the local economy by employing over 200 personnel. It is one of the largest plants of its type in the world, processing milk provided by the numerous local dairies in excess of 2.3 billion pounds of milk annually.

In 1995, the Santa Fe was merged into the BNSF Railway, which operates a division point and large freight classification yard on its Southern Transcon at Clovis, with a dispatcher&#x27;s office monitoring traffic over the Belen Cutoff. This rail corridor is one of the most heavily trafficked routes in the western United States, often with more than 100 mostly intermodal freight trains arriving and leaving Clovis daily. The Southwestern Railroad, formerly the AT&amp;SF Pecos Valley branch line, connects to the BNSF here, shipping potash from mines near Carlsbad.

Clovis is home to Cannon Air Force Base (the 27th Special Operations Wing), Burlington Northern Railroad, the Southwest Cheese Plant, Cummins-Natural Gas Engines, and many locally owned and operated businesses. This community also is surrounded by thousands of acres of farming, ranching, and dairy land. Agriculture is thus a mainstay of the local economy. Many high-school students participate in FFA (Future Farmers of America), where they learn about agriculture. Many local jobs depend on this sector of the economy. According to City-Data.com, the 2016 cost of living index for Clovis was around 83.5, which is well below the national average.

Clovis&#x27; location adjacent to Cannon Air Force Base, a special operations base, has had a large impact on the community. Clovis hosts a local organization, the Committee of Fifty, whose stated purpose is to lobby to keep Cannon AFB open; it subsequently helped coordinate the successful campaign which resulted in the realignment of Cannon to its new special ops mission.

Clovis Municipal Airport provides a base for general aviation and daily service by Key Lime Air to and from Denver International Airport and Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.

In addition to the agricultural, military and railroading sectors, music has contributed to the economy of Clovis almost since the city originated. Norman Petty Studio in Clovis is where several different artists have recorded; one of the most famous is Buddy Holly.

===Health care===
Plains Regional Medical Center is the primary hospital serving Clovis. It is part of the Presbyterian Healthcare Services based in Albuquerque.

==Architecture==

Southwest, Spanish Mission, or Adobe architectural styles are prevalent, being considered representative of New Mexico. Much of Clovis architecture is indistinguishable from the group of styles prevalent throughout most small towns and suburbs since the 1930s.

The Hotel Clovis, a local landmark, opened on October 20, 1931. The hotel was designed by architect Robert Merrill, combining an Art Deco exterior with Southwestern Indian interior. The elegant ballroom hosted such names as Louis Armstrong, Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, and Hank Williams, and the nearby train depot supplied the hotel with most of its business. The hotel closed shortly after the Santa Fe Railroad discontinued passenger train service to Clovis in 1971. The building is currently being renovated into affordable housing. As of January 2013, housing is being offered to the community on a first come-first served basis, with some apartments being available now, and others on an &quot;as finished&quot; basis.

Downtown Clovis has three historic movie theaters, including the State Theater.

<text>Fort Sumner is a village in and the county seat of De Baca County, New Mexico, United States. The population was 1,031 at the 2010 U.S. Census, down from the figure of 1,249 recorded in 2000. Fort Sumner is the spring and fall home of the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility.

==History==
Named after former New Mexico Territory military governor Edwin Vose Sumner, U.S. Fort Sumner was a military fort established in 1862 and charged with the internment of nearby Navajo and Mescalero Apache populations from 1863 to 1868. The federal government closed the fort in 1868 and sold its buildings to Lucien Maxwell, a prominent New Mexico landowner, in 1870. In the latter 1870s Maxwell&#x27;s son Pete befriended legendary outlaw Billy the Kid, and it was in his house that Billy was killed by Pat Garrett. Billy the Kid is buried in the old military cemetery in Fort Sumner, as is Lucien Maxwell.

In 1866, the U.S. government was holding thousands of Native American Indians at Fort Sumner after they were subdued by Kit Carson. Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving saw a business opportunity and decided to sell beef to the United States Government so that the captive, displaced, and imprisoned Native Americans could be fed. This enterprise led to the establishment of the Goodnight-Loving Trail. 

In March 1908, the Eastern Railway of New Mexico (as subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway) arrived as part of the Belen Cutoff; now BNSF.

In the 1920s the Transcontinental Air Transport airline built an airfield in Fort Sumner as part of its coast-to-coast air passenger network, but the site was abandoned when the airline&#x27;s ambitious plans collapsed in the Great Depression. The airfield was reopened by the United States Army Air Forces as a training base during World War II. After the war, the base became the Fort Sumner Municipal Airport, and was chosen as a launch site for NASA&#x27;s high-altitude balloon program (see Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility).

<text>Las Cruces (; &quot;the crosses&quot;) is the second-most populous city in the U.S. state of New Mexico and the seat of Doña Ana County. As of the 2020 census, its population was 111,385, making Las Cruces the most populous city in both Doña Ana County and southern New Mexico. The Las Cruces metropolitan area had an estimated population of 213,849 in 2017. It is the principal city of a metropolitan statistical area which encompasses all of Doña Ana County and is part of the larger El Paso–Las Cruces combined statistical area with a population of 1,088,420, making it the 56th-largest combined statistical area in the United States.

Las Cruces is the economic and geographic center of the Mesilla Valley, the agricultural region on the floodplain of the Rio Grande, which extends from Hatch to the west side of El Paso, Texas. Las Cruces is the home of New Mexico State University (NMSU), New Mexico&#x27;s only land-grant university. The city&#x27;s major employer is the federal government on nearby White Sands Test Facility and White Sands Missile Range. The Organ Mountains, to the east, are dominant in the city&#x27;s landscape, along with the Doña Ana Mountains, Robledo Mountains, and Picacho Peak. Las Cruces lies south of Albuquerque, northwest of El Paso, Texas, and north of the Mexican border at Sunland Park.

Spaceport America, which has corporate offices in Las Cruces, operates from to the north; it has completed several successful crewed, suborbital flights. The city is also the headquarters for Virgin Galactic, the world&#x27;s first company to offer suborbital spaceflights.

==History==

During the Mexican–American War, the Battle of El Bracito was fought nearby on Christmas Day, 1846. The settlement of Las Cruces was founded in 1849, when the US Army first surveyed the town, thus opening up the area for American settlement. The town was first surveyed as the result of the American acquisition of the land surrounding Las Cruces, which later became the New Mexico Territory. This land had been ceded to the United States as a result of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848, which ended the Mexican-American War. The town was named &quot;Las Cruces&quot; after three crosses which were once located just north of the town.

Initially, Mesilla became the leading settlement of the area, with more than 2,000 residents in 1860, more than twice what Las Cruces had; at that time, Mesilla had a population primarily of Mexican descent. When the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway reached the area, the landowners of Mesilla refused to sell it the rights-of-way, and instead residents of Las Cruces donated the rights-of-way and land for a depot in Las Cruces. The first train reached Las Cruces in 1881. Las Cruces was not affected as strongly by the train as some other villages, as it was not a terminus or a crossroads, but the population did grow to 2,300 in the 1880s. Las Cruces was incorporated as a town in 1907.

Pat Garrett is best known for his involvement in the Lincoln County War, but he also worked in Las Cruces on a famous case, the disappearance of Albert Jennings Fountain in 1896.

New Mexico State University was founded in 1888, and it has grown as Las Cruces has grown. The growth of Las Cruces has been attributed to the university, government jobs, and recent retirees. 

The establishment of White Sands Missile Range in 1944 and White Sands Test Facility in 1963 has been integral to population growth. Las Cruces is the nearest city to each, and they provide Las Cruces&#x27; workforce with many high-paying, stable, government jobs. In recent years, the influx of retirees from out of state has also increased Las Cruces&#x27; population.

In the 1960s, Las Cruces undertook a large urban renewal project, intended to convert the old downtown into a modern city center. As part of this, St. Genevieve&#x27;s Catholic Church, built in 1859, was razed to make way for a downtown pedestrian mall. The original covered walkways have been removed in favor of a more traditional main-street thoroughfare.

On February 10, 1990, seven people were shot, four fatally, in the Las Cruces bowling alley massacre. The incident remains unsolved.

==Geography==

The approximate elevation of Las Cruces is above mean sea level.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.18%, is covered by water.

Las Cruces is the center of the Organ Caldera; the Doña Ana Mountains to the north and the Organ Mountains to the east are its margins. Its major eruption was 32 Ma.

Doña Ana County lies within the Chihuahuan Desert ecoregion, and the vegetation surrounding the built portions of the city are typical of this setting; it includes creosote bush (&quot;Larrea tridentata&quot;), soaptree (&quot;Yucca elata&quot;), tarbush (&quot;Flourensia cernua&quot;), broom dalea (&quot;Psorothamnus scoparius&quot;), and various desert grasses such as tobosa (&quot;Hilaria mutica&quot; or &quot;Pleuraphis mutica&quot;) and black grama (&quot;Bouteloua eriopoda&quot;).

The Rio Grande bisects the Mesilla Valley and passes west of Las Cruces proper, supplying irrigation water for the intensive agriculture surrounding the city. Since the institution of water rights, though, the Rio Grande fills its banks only when water is released from upstream dams, which before 2020 usually occurred at least from March to September. Drought conditions, exacerbated by climate change, mean that the Rio Grande experiences increasingly short or small flows.

Prior to farming and ranching, desert shrub vegetation extended into the valley from the adjacent deserts, including extensive stands of tornillo (&quot;Prosopis pubescens&quot;) and catclaw acacia (&quot;Acacia greggii&quot;). Desert grasslands extend in large part between the edges of Las Cruces and the lower slopes of the nearby Organ and Robledo Mountains, where grasses and assorted shrubs and cacti dominate large areas of this mostly rangeland, as well as the occasional large-lot subdivision housing.

The desert and desert grassland uplands surrounding both sides of the Mesilla Valley are often dissected with arroyos, dry streams that often carry water following heavy thunderstorms. These arroyos often contain scattered small trees, and they serve as wildlife corridors between Las Cruces&#x27; urban areas and adjacent deserts or mountains.

===Cityscape===
Unlike many cities its size, Las Cruces lacks a true central business district, because in the 1960s, an urban-renewal project tore down a large part of the original downtown. Many chain stores and national restaurants are located in the rapidly developing east side. Las Cruces&#x27; shopping mall and a variety of retail stores and restaurants are located in this area.

The historic downtown of the city is the area around Main Street, a six-block stretch of which was closed off in 1973 to form a pedestrianized shopping area. The downtown mall has an extensive farmers&#x27; market each Wednesday and Saturday mornings, where a variety of foods and cultural items can be purchased from numerous small stands that are set up by local farmers, artists, and craftspeople. This area also contains museums, businesses, restaurants, churches, art galleries, and theaters, which add a great deal to the changing character of Las Cruces&#x27; historic downtown.

In August 2005, a master plan was adopted, the centerpiece of which was the restoration of narrow lanes of two-way traffic on this model portion of Main Street, which was reopened to vehicular traffic in 2012.

In February 2013, Las Cruces Mayor Ken Miyagishima announced during his &quot;State of the City&quot; address that a park in the area behind the Las Cruces Dam was under construction, in cooperation with the Army Corps of Engineers. The area features trails through restored wetlands, and serves as a major refuge for migratory birds and a key recreational area for the city.

===Climate===

Las Cruces has a cool desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;). Winters alternate between colder and windier weather following trough and frontal passages, and warmer, sunnier periods; light freezes occur 69 nights on average. Spring months can be windy, particularly in the afternoons, sometimes causing periods of blowing dust and short-lived dust storms. Summers begin with the hottest weather of the year, with some extended periods of over temperatures not uncommon, while the latter half of the summer has increased humidity and frequent afternoon thunderstorms, with slightly lower daytime temperatures. Autumns feature decreasing temperatures and precipitation.

Precipitation is very light from October to June, with only occasional winter storm systems bringing any precipitation to the Las Cruces area. Most winter moisture is in the form of rain, though some light snowfalls happen most winters, usually enough to accumulate and stay on the ground for a few hours. Summer precipitation is often from heavy thunderstorms, especially from the late summer monsoon weather pattern.

Since records began in 1892, the lowest temperature recorded at New Mexico State University has been on January 11, 1962 – though only 10 nights have ever fallen to or below – and the highest on June 28, 1994. The lowest maximum on record is on January 28, 1948, and the highest minimum on June 8, 2024. The wettest calendar year has been 1941 with , although 1905 with is the only other year to exceed . The only months to exceed have been September 1941 with and August 1935 with . The wettest single day has been August 30, 1935, with and the driest calendar year 1970 with .

<text>Mesilla (also known as La Mesilla and Old Mesilla) is a town in Doña Ana County, New Mexico, United States. The population was 1,797 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Las Cruces Metropolitan Statistical Area.

During the Civil War, Mesilla briefly served as capital of the Confederate Territory of Arizona.

The Mesilla Plaza is a National Historic Landmark.

== History ==


The first permanent settlement in Mesilla was established by 116 settlers from Chihuahua in the 1840s led by Pablo Melendres.

The village of Mesilla was incorporated in 1848, after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo moved the U.S.–Mexico border south of the village of Doña Ana, placing it in the United States. A small group of citizens, unhappy at being part of the United States, decided to move south of the border. They settled in Mesilla at this time.

By 1850, Mesilla was an established colony. By this time, its people were under constant threat of attack from the Apache. By 1851, the attacks caused the United States to take action to protect its people just to the north of the border, in the Mesilla Valley. They did this by creating Fort Fillmore. As a result of the fort, the United States declared the Mesilla Valley region part of the United States. Mexico also claimed this strip of land, causing it to become known as &quot;No Mans Land&quot;. This boundary dispute, which was officially caused by a map error, was resolved in 1853 with the Gadsden Purchase. Mesilla became a part of the United States, as well as the southern part of New Mexico and Arizona.

Two battles were fought at or in the town during the Civil War. Mesilla served as the capital of the Confederate Territory of Arizona in 1861–1862 and was known as the &quot;hub&quot;, or main city for the entire region. Recaptured by the Volunteers of the California Column, it then became the headquarters of the Military District of Arizona until 1864.

During the &quot;Wild West&quot; era, Mesilla was known for its cantinas and festivals. The area attracted such figures as Billy the Kid, Pat Garrett and Pancho Villa. The village was also the crossroads of two major stagecoach, mail, and trade routes: the Butterfield Stagecoach and the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro. The village of Mesilla was the most important city of the region until 1881, and at about 2,000 residents was the largest city at the time between San Antonio and San Diego.

In 1871 a riot between the supporters of two rival candidates, José Francisco Chaves and José Manuel Gallegos to serve as territorial representative to the United States Congress,resulted in the death of nine men and nearly 50 men injured. The anger over the riot was so intense that many moved away from the town, with some migrating to the valley of the Mimbres River, and others moving over the border to the town of Ascension in Mexico, just over the border from Columbus, New Mexico. This was the worst political riot in New Mexican history.

In 1881, the Santa Fe Railway was ready to build through the Gadsden Purchase region of the country. Mesilla was naturally seen as the city the railroad would run through. However, the people of Mesilla asked for too much money for the land rights, and a landowner in nearby Las Cruces, a much smaller village than Mesilla, stepped in and offered free land. The city of Mesilla has not grown much since, and Las Cruces has grown to a population of an estimated 111,000 people by 2020, and is currently the second largest city in New Mexico.

La Mesilla Historic District, which includes Mesilla Plaza, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961.

The Fountain Theatre, except for 12 years, has been in operation since the early 1900s.

In 2008, the Roman Catholic parish church of San Albino was raised to the status of minor basilica by the Holy See.

The gazebo in the center of the plaza was torn down and rebuilt due to unnoticed structural problems that made the gazebo unsafe. Demolition started in October 2013 and rebuilding ending in May 2014 for the annual &quot;Cinco de Mayo&quot; celebration.

By the second day out, a portion of the party where so befuddled that they got lost in the jungle of mesquite that grew in the area.

<doc id="125883" wikidata="Q1002908" url="?curid=125883" title="Sunland Park, New Mexico">
<text>Sunland Park is a city in southeastern Doña Ana County, New Mexico, United States, on the borders of Texas and the Mexican state of Chihuahua, with Ciudad Juárez adjoining it on the south and El Paso, Texas, on the east. The community of Santa Teresa adjoins it on the northwest. The population of Sunland Park was 14,106 at the 2010 census and was estimated at 17,978 by the United States Census Bureau in 2019. Though it lies adjacent to El Paso, being in Doña Ana County makes it a part of the Las Cruces metropolitan statistical area. Las Cruces is to the north.

The city is at the foot of Mount Cristo Rey, next to the Rio Grande, and is named for Sunland Park Racetrack &amp; Casino, which lies within the city limits. The location was formerly called &quot;Anapra&quot;, a name shared by an adjacent area of Ciudad Juárez.

==History==
Sunland Park was formed when the unincorporated communities of Anapra, Sunland Park, and Meadow Vista voted to incorporate as Sunland Park on July 13, 1983.

===2012 extortion scandal===
In February 2012, then-Mayor Pro Tem Daniel Salinas and City Manager Jaime Aguilera were arrested and charged with extortion of mayoral candidate Gerardo Hernandez. Salinas and Aguilera allegedly tried to blackmail Hernandez into withdrawing from the race with a videotape of Hernandez receiving a lap dance in his campaign office.

An election for mayor was held in March 2012, with Daniel Salinas winning the mayor&#x27;s office, but he was denied taking office due to extortion, bribery, and election fraud charges filed against him, which disqualified him from taking an oath of office.

===Border barrier===


A private organization, named We Build the Wall built a 0.5-mile wall on at the border of Sunland Park and Mexico in 2019. Privately financed using a GoFundMe campaign, the wall was built on private property but the gate they constructed blocked access needed to maintain a federal dam. The barrier in Sunland Park also blocked access to Monument One, an official marker of the International Boundary and Water Commission that was set where New Mexico, Texas and the Mexican state of Chihuahua converge. Lighting along the stretch was shut off in 2021 after the group failed to pay electricity bills, and the owner of the land upon which the wall stood owed property taxes and penalties. The group&#x27;s leaders built only two small stretches of wall/fencing, while defrauding donors of hundreds of thousands of dollars, which were diverted to personal expenses. Among the group&#x27;s organizers, Brian Kolfage pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy and a tax offense; Steve Bannon was also criminally charged, but accepted a pardon from Donald Trump during his final hours as president.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Sunland Park has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.02%, is covered by water.

Sunland Park is the only U.S. border town to the south of the Rio Grande. The city sits close to the unincorporated community of Santa Teresa, New Mexico, another border town.

==Economy and points of interest==

The Sunland Park Racetrack &amp; Casino is located in the city; in the 2010s, it was the main economic driver of the city, which suffers from a high poverty rate. After New Mexico began legal sales of marijuana for recreational use in 2022, a booming marijuana economy sprung up in Sunland Park, sustained primarily by Texans who travel to New Mexico to purchase marijuana, as recreational marijuana sales are prohibited in Texas. As of January 2024, sixteen marijuana dispensaries operated in Sunland Park, the second-most in the state (after Albuquerque, which has a much larger population).

Although the town sits on the U.S.-Mexico border, there is no port of entry in the town.

Western Playland, an amusement park, moved to Sunland Park in 2006, after it left its original location in El Paso County, Texas&#x27;s Ascarate Park, where it had opened in 1960. The park shut down in November 2021, but reopened in 2023 under new ownership.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2010, 14,267 people, 3,884 households, and 3,314 families resided in the city. The population density was . The 4,131 housing units averaged . The racial makeup of the city was 76.00% White, 0.63% African American, 0.51% Native American, 0.2% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 26.02% from other races, and 2.76% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 96.44% of the population.

Of the 3,884 households, 44.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 55% were married couples living together, 24% had a female householder with no husband present, and 11.5% were not families. About 12.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 3.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.63 and the average family size was 3.97.

==Government==
Sunland Park is led by a mayor and a city council. In the mayor&#x27;s absence, the powers of the mayor are exercised by a mayor pro tem. In the event of a vacancy in the mayor&#x27;s seat between elections, the council selects a mayor by appointment. There is also a city manager. City politics are often fractious, and in the 2010s, local politics were marred by a series of scandals.

==The desert==
The desert is located in the Tularosa Basin of New Mexico. Its white sands are not composed of quartz, like most desert sands, but of gypsum, hydrated calcium sulfate. Unlike other desert sands, it is cool to the touch, due to the high rate of evaporation of surface moisture and the fact that the sands reflect, rather than absorb, the sun&#x27;s rays. At 1185 meters above sea level, there are approximately 442 square kilometers of dune fields and is known to be the world&#x27;s largest surface deposit of gypsum.

Gypsum is one of the most common mineral compounds found on Earth but is rarely seen on the surface, as it dissolves easily in water. The origin of this desert dates back to around 100 million years ago, during which it was covered by a shallow sea. As its waters gradually receded, saltwater lakes were left behind, which eventually evaporated in the sun. In addition to the salt, gypsum was also laid down in thick deposits on the old seabed.

The Sacramento and San Andres Mountains, with the Tularosa Basin between them, took shape approximately 250 million years ago. Giant upheavals in the Earth&#x27;s crust distorted the land along with the gypsum deposits, forcing them high into the air about 70 million years ago. Rainfall and melt water came from the mountains causing the gypsum to percolate out and the concentrated solutions were washed down the mountainsides. The gypsum solution accumulated in Lake Lucero, the lowest part of the Tularosa Basin. Water in the lake does not have any means of escaping except by evaporation, which leaves behind thin layers of crystallized gypsum, or selenite. Weathering then reduced these crystals to fine, sandy grains. Winds then carried the grains farther up the basin, and the grains piled in steep dunes that often reach as high as 15 m (50 ft). The winds carved more dunes and, while at the same time, carried small amounts of the gypsum grains by distances of up to 9 m (30 ft) a year.

This constant movement still occurs today, and with the added alkaline and the little amount of rainfall makes it difficult for plants to grow here, leaving the desert as desolate as it appears today.

==Education==
It is located in Las Cruces Public Schools. White Sands School is on the property of the White Sands Missile Range.

<text>Carlsbad ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Eddy County, New Mexico, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 32,238. Carlsbad is centered at the intersection of U.S. Routes 62/180 and 285, and is the principal city of the Carlsbad-Artesia Micropolitan Statistical Area, which has a total population of 62,314. Located in the southeastern part of New Mexico, Carlsbad straddles the Pecos River and sits at the eastern edge of the Guadalupe Mountains.

Carlsbad is a hub for potash mining, petroleum production, and tourism. Carlsbad Caverns National Park is located southwest of the city, and Guadalupe Mountains National Park lies southwest across the Texas border. The Lincoln National Forest is to the northwest of town.

== History ==

The development of southeastern New Mexico in the late 19th century was fueled by the arrival of colonies of immigrants from England, Switzerland, France, and Italy. Located along the banks of the Pecos River, Carlsbad was originally christened the town of Eddy on September 15, 1888, and organized as a municipal corporation in 1893; the settlement bore the name of Charles B. Eddy, co-owner of the Eddy-Bissell Livestock Company.

With the commercial development of local mineral springs near the flume for medicinal qualities, the town later voted to change its name to Carlsbad after the famous European spa Karlsbad, Bohemia (now Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic), which in turn was named after Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia. On March 25, 1918, the growing town surpassed a population of 2,000, allowing then-governor of New Mexico Washington Ellsworth Lindsey to proclaim Carlsbad a city.

Most of Carlsbad&#x27;s development was due to irrigation water. Local cattlemen recognized the value of diverting water from the Pecos River to the grazing lands on Eddy&#x27;s Halagueno Ranch. Many construction projects were undertaken to establish an irrigation system within the town. The Avalon Dam was constructed upstream of town, and canals diverted the water into town. Conflict arose when the canals met the river downstream; as a result, the Pecos River Flume was built, first out of wood and later concrete (the flume is often titled the only place where a river crosses itself).

Key to the growth of the area was special excursion trains that brought visitors from the East at reduced fares. Before the Pecos Valley Railroad arrived in 1891, travel parties met at the railroad station in Toyah, Texas, and were driven by buggy over a rough, dusty road to this small but growing settlement on the banks of the Pecos River. Most of the early construction in Carlsbad was completed with locally manufactured bricks. The bricks were quite soft and of poor quality. The former First National Bank building at the corner of Canal and Fox streets is one of the few remaining buildings constructed with local brick. The re-discovery of Carlsbad Caverns (then known as &quot;Bat Cave&quot;) by local cowboys in 1901 and the subsequent establishment of Carlsbad Caverns National Park on May 14, 1930, gained the town of Carlsbad substantial recognition.

In 1925, potash was discovered near Carlsbad, and for many years Carlsbad dominated the American potash market. Following the decline of the potash market in the 1960s, the residents and leaders of Carlsbad lobbied for the establishment of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), a site where low-level nuclear waste would be stored thousands of feet underground in salt beds. Congress authorized the WIPP project in 1979, and construction began in 1980. The DOE Carlsbad Area Office opened in 1993, and the first waste shipment arrived in 1999.

Currently, Carlsbad has experienced a &quot;boom&quot;. The city is leading in the production of oil and natural gases across the entire area, causing an increase in the employment rate. Due to this increase, families and individuals have begun to migrate to Carlsbad.

<text>Industrial rock is a fusion genre that fuses industrial music and rock music. It initially originated in the 1970s, and drew influence from early experimental and industrial acts such as Throbbing Gristle, Einstürzende Neubauten and Chrome. Industrial rock became more prominent in the 1980s with the success of artists such as Killing Joke, Swans, and partially Skinny Puppy, and later spawned the offshoot genre known as industrial metal. The genre was made more accessible to mainstream audiences in the 1990s with the aid of acts such as Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson, both of which have released platinum-selling records.

==History==
=== Origins (late 1970s and 1980s) ===
Richie Unterberger assessed the Red Krayola as &quot;a precursor to industrial rock&quot; with their 1967 record &quot;The Parable of Arable Land&quot; exhibiting music made by 50 people on anything from industrial power tools to a revving motorcycle whilst &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s Alex Lindhart cited their 1968 follow up &quot;God Bless the Red Krayola and All Who Sail With It&quot; as being &quot;bootleg Einstürzende Neubauten at its grimiest atonality&quot;. AllMusic critic Alex Henderson has stated that experimental group Cromagnon&#x27;s 1969 record &quot;Orgasm&quot; foreshadowed the industrial rock sound. Specifically, Pitchfork&#x27;s Zach Baron noted their song &quot;Caledonia&quot; for its &quot;pre-industrial stomp&quot;. Krautrock musicians Michael Rother and Klaus Dinger included industrial noise on their track &quot;Negativland&quot; (from their 1972 debut &quot;Neu!&quot;) as well as krautrock band Faust on their track &quot;Meadow Meal&quot; (from their 1971 debut &quot;Faust&quot;). AllMusic stated that Suicide&#x27;s 1977 debut album &quot;provided the blueprints for post-punk, synth pop, and industrial rock.&quot;

In 1976, English musician David Bowie collaborated with American musician Iggy Pop on his 1977 solo debut &quot;The Idiot&quot;. Musically, the album is said to contain elements of industrial rock, notably the closing track, &quot;Mass Production&quot;, which contains numerous &quot;proto-industrial noises&quot; created using tape loops, and is described by Hugo Wilcken as &quot;early industrial electronica&quot;. &quot;The Idiot&quot; has been described as having a major influence on Joy Division, who formed shortly before its release. Joy Division were signed to the industrially themed label Factory Records which had been founded in 1978; their albums &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; (1979) and &quot;Closer&quot; (1980) heavily influenced the further development of industrial rock. Chrome has also been credited as the &quot;beginning of industrial rock&quot; and their 1978 &quot;Half Machine Lip Moves&quot; was listed on &quot;Wire&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Records That Set The World On Fire (When No One Was Listening)&quot;.

Industrial rock was created in the mid- to late 1970s, amidst the punk rock revolution and disco fever. Prominent early industrial musicians include Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, NON, SPK and Z&#x27;EV. Many other artists have been cited as influences such as Kraftwerk, Gary Numan, and Tubeway Army as well as Einstürzende Neubauten and Fad Gadget. Many other musical performers were incorporating industrial music elements into a variety of musical styles.

Some post-punk performers developed styles parallel to industrial music&#x27;s defining attributes. Pere Ubu&#x27;s debut, &quot;The Modern Dance&quot;, was described by Jim Irvin as &quot;industrial&quot;, and Chris Connelly said the musical project Foetus was &quot;the instigator when it comes to the marriage of machinery to hardcore punk.&quot; Music journalist Simon Reynolds considered Killing Joke, which saw mainstream success with their 1985 album &quot;Night Time&quot;, &quot;a post-punk version of heavy metal.&quot;

Others followed in their wake. The New York City band Swans were inspired by the local no wave scene, as well as punk rock, noise music (particularly Whitehouse) and the original industrial groups. Steve Albini&#x27;s Big Black followed a similar path, while also incorporating American hardcore punk. Big Black has also been closely associated with post-hardcore and noise rock, though their ties to industrial music are extremely apparent. The Swiss trio The Young Gods, who deliberately eschewed electric guitars in favor of a sampler, also took inspiration from both hardcore and industrial. In 1986, Canadian band Skinny Puppy released the album &quot;&quot;, with its lead single, &quot;Dig It&quot;, seeing frequent airplay on MTV. The song was a major influence on Nine Inch Nails founder Trent Reznor, who used it as inspiration when writing his first song, &quot;Down in It&quot;.

Chicago&#x27;s Wax Trax! Records became a vanguard for the genre in the 1980s and is credited for introducing it to the United States. Ministry&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot;, departed from the band&#x27;s synthesizer-oriented sound for a rock style that drew from hardcore punk and thrash metal, while retaining electronic elements and samples. Ministry frontman Al Jourgensen was also involved in multiple industrial rock side projects that were signed to Wax Trax!, including Revolting Cocks, 1000 Homo DJs and Pailhead. Drawing heavy influences from the New York&#x27;s no wave scene, Cop Shoot Cop incorporated two bass guitars with no guitars.

===Mainstream popularity (1990s)===

In the 1990s, industrial rock broke into the mainstream with artists and bands such as Nine Inch Nails, Orgy, White Zombie, and Marilyn Manson. In December 1992, Nine Inch Nails&#x27; EP &quot;Broken&quot; was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Nine Inch Nails gained further popularity with the release of their 1994 album &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, which was certified 4× platinum by the RIAA in 1998. The band&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;The Fragile&quot; was certified 2× platinum in January 2000. With the success of Nine Inch Nails, the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; was certified 3× platinum by the RIAA. In the 1990s, four Nine Inch Nails songs went on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Several industrial rock and industrial metal artists such as KMFDM, Fear Factory, Gravity Kills and Sister Machine Gun appeared on the 1995 &quot;Mortal Kombat: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;, which was certified platinum by the RIAA in January 1996.

Marilyn Manson released their album &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; in 1996, which was certified platinum by the RIAA two months after its release date. In the United States, &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; sold at least 1,900,000 units. Marilyn Manson&#x27;s EP &quot;Smells Like Children&quot; was certified platinum in May 1998. The band&#x27;s third album &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; went to number 1, dethroning Lauryn Hill&#x27;s solo debut &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; and selling 223,000 copies in its first week in stores. It was certified platinum by the RIAA in February 1999 and sold at least 1,409,000 copies in the United States. Orgy also experienced mainstream success during the 1990s. The band&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Candyass&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA in July 1999. Orgy&#x27;s cover of New Order&#x27;s song &quot;Blue Monday&quot; went to number 56 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 2 on the Dance Club Songs chart. White Zombie experimented with industrial metal on its 1995 album &quot;Astro-Creep: 2000&quot;, which was certified 2× platinum by the RIAA in March 1996. White Zombie&#x27;s vocalist Rob Zombie began creating pure industrial metal albums in his solo career. Rob Zombie&#x27;s 1998 solo debut studio album &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe&quot; was certified 3× platinum by the RIAA less than two years after its release date. In November 1999, Powerman 5000&#x27;s album &quot;Tonight the Stars Revolt!&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA. The album sold at least 1,316,172 units in the United States.
A large Industrial metal scene also emerged in Europe in the 20th century. The Industrial Metal band that manages to appeal to the largest audiences worldwide is Rammstein.
Other names have also proven successful in the European scene, including Pain, Deathstars, Dagoba, Eisbrecher, Gothminister and Godflesh.
