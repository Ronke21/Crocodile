<text>Rowena is an unincorporated community in Wasco County, Oregon, United States. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Rowena as a census-designated place (CDP). The census definition of the area may not precisely correspond to local understanding of the area with the same name. The population was 187 at the 2010 census.

Rowena is located west of The Dalles on the Columbia River, where the river passes through the natural feature Rowena Gap. Interstate 84 (Columbia River Highway) and U.S. Route 30 (Historic Columbia River Highway) pass through the community. Route 30 near Rowena is notable for the Rowena Loops.

The origin of the name &quot;Rowena&quot; is disputed. Two sources say Rowena was named for H.S. Rowe, a railroad company official, in the early 1880s. Another source says it was named for a girl, Rowena, who had been living in the area at the time the community was founded. It is also possible that the name comes indirectly from Rowena, Ivanhoe&#x27;s lover in the novel of the same name by Sir Walter Scott.

There was once a ferry operating between Rowena and Lyle, Washington, across the Columbia.

The Nature Conservancy has a nature reserve on the plateau near Rowena, the Tom McCall Preserve, known for its spring wildflowers. The preserve is owned and managed in co-operation with Mayer State Park.

<doc id="130995" wikidata="Q2358660" url="?curid=130995" title="Shaniko, Oregon">
<text>Shaniko (, ) is a city located in Wasco County, Oregon, United States, on U.S. Route 97 and about north of Antelope. The population was 30 at the 2020 census.

== Geography ==
Shaniko is in Wasco County, in north-central Oregon, at the intersection of U.S. Route 97 and Oregon Route 218. The city is north of Redmond and east of Portland. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

The city is at an elevation of . On the high plateau on which Shaniko was built, the soil is thin and the vegetation sparse, consisting mainly of sagebrush, bunchgrass, and occasional junipers. Many peaks of the Cascade Range, including Hood, Jefferson, Adams, St. Helens and Rainier, are visible from the city.

== History ==
The first European Americans came to the Shaniko area after the discovery of gold in Canyon City, Oregon, in 1862. The route to Canyon City started at the early settlement of The Dalles, away. Camps were made wherever water could be found. One camp, which became the farming community of Bakeoven, was closely associated with the future town of Shaniko, while another camp, Cross Hollow, was within the present Shaniko city limits. In 1867, following complaints of hostile Indians and fear of robbery of those transporting gold, the State of Oregon received a grant from the United States government to build a military wagon road from The Dalles to Fort Boise in what was then Washington Territory, (now Idaho). Following this road, homesteaders began claiming land in Central Oregon that previously had been fairly inaccessible.

One of these settlers was August Scherneckau, who came to the area after the Civil War, in 1874. The spelling of the town&#x27;s name reflects local Native American pronunciation of Scherneckau&#x27;s name. The town was originally called Cross Hollow, and a post office by that name was established in May 1879 with Scherneckau as postmaster. Cross Hollow post office closed in 1887, and Shaniko post office opened in 1900. An application to incorporate the city was submitted February 9, 1901, and the first official meeting of the Shaniko city council occurred on March 16, 1901.

The town&#x27;s heyday was the first decade of the 20th century, when Shaniko served as a transportation hub spurred by the presence of the Columbia Southern Railway, a subsidiary of Union Pacific Railroad, which built a branch from Biggs Junction to a terminus in Shaniko. That branch was completed in May 1900. At the time, the city was known as the &quot;Wool Capital of the World&quot;, and it was a regional center of of wool, wheat, cattle and sheep production, with no other such center east of the Cascade Range in Oregon. The region served by the city even stretched into Idaho, south to Klamath Falls, Oregon, and beyond, because of rail connections to the main line.

The residents of Shaniko voted to incorporate Shaniko and elected a mayor, F. T. Hurlbert, and other city officials on January 1, 1902. It was Wasco County&#x27;s fifth largest city, boasting the largest wool warehouse in the state, from which (2,000 tons) were marketed in 1901. It was surrounded by cattle ranches, which produced livestock for shipment that filled 400 railroad cars that year. In 1903, when Shaniko gained the nickname, &quot;Wool Capital of the World&quot;, they shipped 2,229 tons of wool and 1,168,866 bushels of wheat. They made $3,000,000 in wool sales in 1903. The second sale of that year one warehouse deposited a million into the bank. There was a third sale that year as well. In 1904, total annual sales were five million dollars.

By 1911, the Oregon–Washington Railroad and Navigation Company, another Union Pacific subsidiary, began using an alternate route linking Portland to Bend by way of the Deschutes River canyon. The new line, advertised as the &quot;direct, quick and natural route&quot;, diverted traffic from the Columbia Southern, and Shaniko began to decline. Passenger rail service to Shaniko ended in the early 1930s, and the entire line was shut down by 1966. By 1982 Shaniko was nearly a ghost town. Shaniko was first called a &quot;ghost town&quot; at the Oregon Centennial Exposition in Portland in 1959.

In 1985, Jean and Dorothy Farrell of Salem, OR bought the Shaniko Hotel which was deserted at that time. They invested their retirement savings to remodel the Hotel before it was reopened in 1988. Jean later became the Mayor of Shaniko and continued to own and operate the renovated hotel until he sold it in July of 2000 to businessman Robert Pamplin Jr. Pamplin purchased the hotel and several other properties in Shaniko with intentions of bringing life back to this once thriving ghost town. Pamplin renovated some buildings and planned to build new houses for workers who would cater to tourists. But in 2008, the Shaniko City Council and the state of Oregon denied Pamplin an easement from a well on one of his lots to supply water to the hotel and restaurant bypassing having to purchase the water from the city. He ultimately shut down the hotel, cafe, RV park, and capped off the well. He eventually listed the properties for sale over an 8 year period before taking them off the market in 2016. In August 2023, Pamplin reopened the Shaniko Hotel once again to the public.

Shaniko attracts ghost town tourists, but a wastewater issue still prevents any large scale tourism efforts from forming. Local businesses operate seasonally from April to September to accommodate the tourists, including those in &quot;Shaniko Row&quot;.

<text>Aloha (, not ) is a census-designated place and unincorporated community in Washington County, Oregon, United States. By road it is west of downtown Portland. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 53,828. Fire protection and EMS services are provided through Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue and American Medical Response.

==History==
On January 9, 1912, the community received its name with the opening of a post office named Aloha; the area had previously been known as Wheeler Crossing. According to &quot;Oregon Geographic Names&quot;, the origin of the name Aloha is disputed. Some sources say it was named by Robert Caples, a railroad worker, but it is unknown why the name was chosen. In 1983 Joseph H. Buck claimed that his uncle, the first postmaster, Julius Buck, named the office &quot;Aloah&quot; after a small resort on Lake Winnebago in Wisconsin. Supposedly the last two letters were transposed by the Post Office during the application process. The local pronunciation, however, has remained rather than .

The community attempted to incorporate in 1984, but the regional boundary commission halted the effort after determining the community could not provide the needed municipal services of a city.

In 2012, a public library was opened in a space within a strip mall shopping center on Farmington Road at Kinnaman Road (previously anchored by Bales Thriftway until its closure in 2020). Named the Aloha Community Library, it was established by the non-profit Aloha Community Library Association and is staffed by volunteers. At the time of its opening, it had about 4,500 books.

<text>Cedar Hills is a census-designated place and neighborhood in Washington County, Oregon, United States south of U.S. Route 26 and west of Oregon Route 217 and within the Portland metropolitan area. Construction began in 1946.

The formal Cedar Hills neighborhood currently includes 2,114 homes, whose owners are subject to the rules and covenants enforced by the area&#x27;s homeowners&#x27; association, the Homes Association of Cedar Hills.

==History==

Plans to build the large new neighborhood were announced by the project&#x27;s developers in April 1946, and construction of the first 50 homes had begun by then. Along with roads and utilities, the plans included a shopping center, schools, parks and churches, in a neighborhood of around 2,000 homes on about . A writer for &quot;The Oregonian&quot; newspaper at the time called it &quot;the most ambitious suburban housing development ever attempted in the Northwest&quot;. The planned neighborhood was consistent with the racism in Oregon at the time, as the 1946 restrictions stated that &quot;only Caucasians shall use or occupy the properties, except in the capacity of domestic servants, chauffeurs or employees.&quot;
Construction of the planned shopping center began in 1954. Located immediately south of the Sunset Highway, at the northern end of the neighborhood, Cedar Hills Shopping Center opened in April 1955. It originally included a Safeway supermarket (opened in August 1954, months earlier than the remainder of the center), a Rodgers five-and-dime, a Sears catalog store, and several other shops, along with a bank and a gas station. The center&#x27;s tall neon sign became a local landmark. In 1979, TriMet opened a bus transit center on Wilshire Street, behind the shopping center. Cedar Hills Transit Center remained in operation for almost 20 years, until replaced by the Sunset Transit Center – located immediately across the Sunset Highway (US 26) freeway from Cedar Hills Shopping Center – in 1998, with the opening of the Westside MAX line. The Sunset TC&#x27;s construction included a long pedestrian bridge over the freeway, to provide access between the TriMet bus and MAX station and the Cedar Hills neighborhood. In 2009, the Oregon Department of Transportation opened a new Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division (DMV) office in the Cedar Hills Shopping Center, serving as the DMV&#x27;s Beaverton office, replacing one located on Allen Blvd. in Beaverton proper.

==Geography==

The average household size was 2.39 and the average family size was 2.94.

In the neighborhood the population was spread out, with 23.0% under the age of 18, 7.7% from 18 to 24, 33.4% from 25 to 44, 23.4% from 45 to 64, and 12.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 98.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.8 males.

==Public services==
===Schools===
Cedar Hills is within the Beaverton School District. Cedar Park Middle School and Barnes Elementary School are the only public schools located within the Cedar Hills CDP, but the area&#x27;s residents are also served by Sunset High School, Meadow Park Middle School, Ridgewood Elementary and William Walker Elementary. At the high school level, boundary changes approved in October 2016 and scheduled to take effect with the 2017–2018 school year will make Cedar Hills part of Beaverton High School&#x27;s coverage area, in place of Sunset High School.

Previously, the area was also the site of Cedar Hills Elementary School, built in the early 1950s, at the intersection of SW Cedar Hills Blvd. and SW Park Way. That school closed in 1983, due to declining student enrollment districtwide at the time, and the building was leased to, and subsequently sold to, the Tualatin Hills Park &amp; Recreation District, which repurposed it as the Cedar Hills Recreation Center.

===Other services===

Fire protection and emergency medical services are provided through Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue.

Cedar Hills is served by the Tualatin Hills Park &amp; Recreation District (THPRD), which maintains several parks in the area–including the man-made Commonwealth Lake Park. While the Oregon Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife regularly stock the lake with trout, bluegill and bass can be found in the lake, as well as carp. THPRD also operates the Cedar Hills Recreation Center, a community center (not limited to Cedar Hills residents) located in a former elementary school.

<text>Cedar Mill is a suburb in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area of the United States; it is a census-designated place and an unincorporated community in Washington County, north of U.S. Route 26 and west of the Willamette Stone. It received its name from a sawmill on Cedar Mill Creek, which cut Western Redcedars that were once the dominant tree in the area. The mill&#x27;s pond was near the intersection of 119th and Cornell Road, and could still be seen into the 1960s, although the mill itself had ceased operating in 1891. The name was established in 1874 with the opening of a U.S. post office named Cedar Mill. As of the 2020 census, the community population was 17,259.

==History==

===Early history===

Before white settlement, the land was inhabited by the Atfalati, a subgroup of the Kalapuya, called the &quot;Tualatin&quot; or &quot;Wapato Lake Indians&quot; by settlers. Nearby Beaverton was known by the Natives as &quot;Cha Kepi&quot;, meaning &quot;Place of the Beaver&quot;. While in 1782 the native population exceeded several thousand, due to diseases brought by the settlers sixty years later, in 1842, the population was merely six hundred. By 1890, the members of the tribe had been reduced to 28 and the last known speaker of the Tualatin language, Louis Kenoyer, died in 1936. Early settlers in the area would recall Native Americans passing through the area, visiting their former lands.

Most of the land in the area, as was typical in the Tualatin Valley, was settled in accord with the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850. Pioneer Samuel Walters was the first white settler to arrive in the area, doing so in 1847. William Cornell, namesake of Cornell Road, settled near what is now the easternmost part of Cedar Mill with his wife Emily in 1852. The area became a school district in 1856.

The sawmill was established in 1859 by John Halsey Jones and his father, Justus, and was the &quot;first organized business&quot; in what is now Cedar Mill. Plans for the mill, which was located on the south side of Cornell Road at McDaniel Road (now N.W. 119th Avenue), were established as early as 1855 by the 23-year old Jones. The Jones Sawmill was sold in December 1869 to John Quincy Adams Young and William Everson, becoming the Young–Everson Mill. It was renamed the Young Brothers Sawmill after J.Q.A. Young&#x27;s sons Linc and Jasper acquired it. It ceased operation in 1891 and was abandoned in 1892.

Many of Cedar Mill&#x27;s early settlers were Irish Catholics. Thomas and Ann Leahy reached the Portland area in 1852 and in 1865 the Leahys, now including their infant son John, moved into a house on present-day Leahy Road, the family&#x27;s namesake. Thomas died in 1874, and Ann in 1913. Following Ann Leahy&#x27;s death, the property was divided among John and his brother Hugh. After their deaths in logging accidents in 1929 and 1940 respectively, the property continued in the family and descendants of the Leahy family continue to reside there today. Owen and Mary Murray, the namesake of Murray Road, moved to Oregon in the early 1880s and established a 120-acre farm. Their son Joseph Murray sold the farm due to debts brought on by the Great Depression in 1936.

===Mill and post office===

According to &quot;Oregon Geographic Names&quot;, a &quot;Cedar Mill&quot; post office was established in 1874, in the John Quincy Adams Young House, built in 1869, which still stands on Cornell Road and is owned by the Tualatin Hills Park &amp; Recreation District. The name was chosen by Young, who had &quot;been commissioned to establish a post office in the area&quot; and been named the first postmaster. The Young–Everson sawmill, specializing in cedar products, was still the only business operating in the area at the time and was also located directly adjacent to the post office, making &quot;Cedar Mill&quot; a logical choice for the name of the new postal station. Around the same time, in 1874, Young retired from milling, sold the mill to Everson, and moved his family into a new, larger house on the north side of Cornell Road, just across from the 1869-built house that was now being used as a post office. Along with the post office, Young also operated a small store on the ground floor of his former house. In 1976, the Russell family of Cedar Mill had owned the house since 1914.

John Q. A. Young served as Cedar Mill postmaster until December 1881. His successor, George Reeves, moved the post office in 1882 to a new general store that Reeves opened in that year, located just northwest of the intersection of Barnes and Cornell Roads. The Cedar Mill post office, always located within a store, was moved two more times before closing on July 3, 1904. The final stamp cancelled at the post office was owned in 1976 by Bernard P. Young, a descendant of John and Elizabeth Young.

===20th century===

The present-day Leedy Grange #339 building, near the corner of Saltzman and Cornell Roads and near the Cedar Mill Library, was built in 1900 (according to Leedy Grange 1903). It originally housed a Modern Woodmen organization; however, in 1913 (1906 according to the Grange) the building was sold to the Leedy Grange, and the second story removed. The monthly Cedar Mill Flea Market was held at the grange the first Saturday of each month but was discontinued. The first Flea Market was held in June 2010.

Public transit service to Cedar Mill was operated in the 1940s by Tualatin Valley Stages, which after 1953 became Tualatin Valley Buses, Inc.–part of a consortium of privately owned companies known as the &quot;Blue Bus&quot; lines. It continued to serve the area through the 1960s, until TriMet took over the Blue Bus lines in 1970.

A Cedar Mill Heritage Quilt was created in the summer of 1976 by 15 local women. It detailed various aspects of Cedar Mill history. Former U.S. Senator Maurine Neuberger declared the winner of the quilting competition in September 1976.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.
The appropriately named Cedar Mill Creek flows through the area. The creek begins its course in the Forest Heights neighborhood in northwest Multnomah County, then passes through Cedar Mill before flowing into Beaverton Creek in Tualatin Hills Nature Park. North Johnson Creek, another waterway in the area, begins south of Cedar Mill Creek and joins the main stream at the Nike World Campus. Cedar Mill Falls is the area&#x27;s only waterfall, flowing near the Cedar Mill Greenway and JQA Young House. The waterfall, formerly used to provide power for the mill, is a 32-foot high basaltic rock formation. The Sue Conger Memorial Boardwalk, opened in June 2013, allows visitors of all abilities to view the falls. The only lake in the area is Hartung Lake, in the Hartung Farms neighborhood. Johnson Creek also flows through the area.

Sunset High School is the public high school with Cedar Mill in its attendance boundary.

In the 1990 U.S. Census, the land containing Sunset HS was in the Cedar Mill CDP. In 1999, the area with the school was annexed by the City of Beaverton.

Private schools include Catlin Gabel School, Prince of Peace Lutheran School, and St. Pius X Catholic School (of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon).

===School history===
The first school district serving Cedar Mill, along with nearby Bethany, the Union School District (District 6), was established in 1856. The first school, serving grades 1 through 8, was built on land donated by pioneer Samuel Walters. The one-room Union School building, built in 1884 and located on what is now N.W. 143rd Avenue adjacent to the Union Cemetery, was replaced by a new two-room building on the same site in 1901, and the school remained in operation until 1948. District 6 was divided twice in the 1880s, with the eastern portion becoming the new Cedar Mill School District in 1883 and the northwestern portion becoming the Bethany School District in 1887 (serving the Bethany and Rock Creek areas, not Cedar Mill). The Union and Bethany districts consolidated in 1948, renamed as Sunset Valley School District. In 1960, the Cedar Mill and Sunset Valley Districts were absorbed by a greatly expanded Beaverton School District (District 48).

Another former school in the area was Sunset Valley Elementary School, which was built in 1948 to replace Union School and was located on Murray Road immediately north of Sunset Highway. In 1979, shortly before the school&#x27;s closure in spring 1980, the building was acquired by Electro Scientific Industries (whose main campus was located nearby) and used as ESI&#x27;s administrative headquarters until the mid-1990s, when it was razed and replaced by a Home Depot store.

<doc id="131002" wikidata="Q1822776" url="?curid=131002" title="Cornelius, Oregon">
<text>Cornelius is a city in Washington County, Oregon, United States. Located in the Portland metropolitan area, the city&#x27;s population was 11,869 at the 2010 census. The city lies along Tualatin Valley Highway between Forest Grove to the west and Hillsboro to the east. Cornelius was incorporated in 1893 and is named for founder Thomas R. Cornelius.

==History==
In 1845, Benjamin Cornelius immigrated to Oregon with his family, traveling with Joseph Meek. The Cornelius family settled on the Tualatin Plains, near what is now North Plains. The same year, Benjamin Q. Tucker and Solomon Emerick staked land claims and established farms on the land that would eventually become Cornelius. At that time, the area was called Free Orchards; there was no actual community, but the name referred to the orchards on the of land.

In 1871, Benjamin Cornelius&#x27;s son Colonel Thomas R. Cornelius learned that Ben Holladay planned to extend the Oregon and California Railroad right through Free Orchards. Holladay had been told by Forest Grove and Hillsboro that they would not allow the railroad free right-of-way, so Holladay planned to bypass them, and build Free Orchards into a new city that would become the new county seat of Washington County.

The new railroad was approaching Free Orchards in 1871, and Cornelius saw an opportunity to benefit from the new railroad. He left his farm and built a new house, a warehouse, and a store in Free Orchards. The warehouse and store were located right next to the railroad, and so became natural places for local farmers to trade and store their goods. Cornelius also built a creamery to process milk, and two sawmills to supply lumber for the growing community. In addition, he helped to build the first frame schoolhouse and the Methodist Church.

In 1893, Free Orchards was incorporated and renamed &quot;Cornelius&quot;, to honor the man who spent many years helping build the community. Though Holladay&#x27;s plan to make Free Orchards into the county seat never materialized, Cornelius survives today as an agricultural town and, increasingly, as a suburb of Portland. The Cornelius Public Library was founded in 1912.

<text>Durham is a city in Washington County, Oregon, United States. Incorporated in 1966, the city is surrounded by Tigard and Tualatin and is adjacent to the Bridgeport Village shopping complex. The population was 1,351 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The city was named for Albert Alonzo Durham, founder of the nearby city of Lake Oswego. Durham operated a sawmill and a flour mill on Fanno Creek, which flows through the city, from 1866 until his death in 1898. The site, located along the Boones Ferry Road to Portland, was originally known as Durhams Mills. In 1908, the Oregon Electric Railway established a stop called Durham at the location. Residents of the city voted for incorporation in 1966 to protect the location from industrialization of its residential areas. Today, the community is primarily residential.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. It sits at above sea-level. The main road through Durham is Upper Boones Ferry Road, with Interstate 5 approximately east of the city. Part of the western boundary of the city is the Tualatin River, with Durham City Park also on the western edge of Durham.

<text>Forest Grove is a city in Washington County, Oregon, United States, west of Portland. Originally a small farm town, it is now primarily a commuter town in the Portland metro area . Settled in the 1840s, the town was platted in 1850, then incorporated in 1872, making it the first city in Washington County . The population was 21,083 at the 2010 census, an increase of 19.1% over the 2000 figure (17,708).

Located in the Tualatin Valley, Oregon routes 8, and 47 pass through Forest Grove with 47 and 8 signed as the Tualatin Valley Highway south and east of the main part of the city, respectively, Oregon Route 8 signed as Gales Creek Road west of the city, and Oregon Route 47 signed as the Nehalem Highway north of the city. Pacific University has been the most distinctive aspect of the town throughout its history. Old College Hall on campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places along with nine other structures in the city.

==History==
Prior to the 1840s when Euro-Americans settled the area, the Atfalati band of the Kalapuya Native American tribe lived on the Tualatin Plains in what is now Forest Grove. In 1841, Alvin T. and Abigail Smith were among the earliest to use the Oregon Trail and settled on what was first known as West Tualatin Plain. They overwintered with Henry Harmon Spalding, arriving in what is now Forest Grove in the fall. Intending to be missionaries, they found little potential as most of the natives had succumbed to European diseases. Smith served as the community&#x27;s first postmaster beginning on February 1, 1850, and his log cabin served as the post office.

According to &quot;Oregon Geographic Names&quot;, the name Forest Grove was selected on January 10, 1851, at a meeting of the trustees of Tualatin Academy (later known as Pacific University). Resident and school trustee J. Quinn Thornton suggested the name, which he also had used for the name of his homestead. The name referred to a grove of oak trees that still stand on what is now the campus of the university. Previous post offices in the area were called Tuality Plains and Tualatin, with Forest Grove adopted on December 31, 1858. The city was platted in 1850.

In 1860, the population reached 430, but declined to 396 in 1870. Forest Grove was incorporated by the state in 1872, the first in the county. In 1880, the now Chemawa Indian School opened in the city to forcibly assimilate Native American children, but moved to Salem in 1884. The city started the Fire Department in 1894. The population reached nearly 1,300 in 1900.

In November 1908, the Oregon Electric Railway (OE) began serving the city, and in January 1914, competitor Southern Pacific (SP) followed suit, opening its own line, separate from OE&#x27;s. Both railroads provided freight and passenger service, SP&#x27;s passenger service being known as the Red Electric. A company called the Forest Grove Transportation Company operated local streetcar service that linked downtown to Carnation, Oregon, where the Oregon &amp; California Railroad built its depot, but the service lasted only from 1906 to 1911. The Red Electric passenger service to Forest Grove ended in 1929 and Oregon Electric&#x27;s ceased in 1932.

In February 2016, a high-pitched, hissing noise called the Forest Grove Sound was heard by several residents of the town.

There are 12 properties individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places and two historic districts: the 18-block Clark Historic District with homes dating as far back as 1854 (and several dozen pre-1900) and the Painter&#x27;s Woods Historic District. These include the Alvin T. Smith House, First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Old College Hall.

<text>Garden Home-Whitford is a census-designated place (CDP) consisting of the neighborhoods of Garden Home and the smaller Whitford area in Washington County, Oregon, United States.

== History ==
Garden Home post office was established in 1882. Garden Home was an established community when the Oregon Electric Railway was built at the beginning of the 20th century, which named a depot on the line for the community. Whitford was a station on the same line, located at the present-day intersection of Allen Road and Scholls Ferry Road (Oregon Route 210); the name was created by combining the names of W.A. White and A.C. Bedford, New York investors who were directors of the railway.

Whitford station closed when the railway stopped running circa 1920 and, unlike Garden Home, which became the name of a Portland suburb, Whitford exists today primarily as the name of a Beaverton middle school.

<text>Gaston is a city in Washington County, Oregon, United States. Located between Forest Grove to the north and Yamhill to the south, the city straddles Oregon Route 47 and borders the Tualatin River. Named after railroad executive Joseph Gaston, its population was 637 as of the 2010 census.

== History ==
The first known inhabitants of the Tualatin Valley were the Atfalati tribe, a subset of the Kalapuya ethnic group. Contact with Europeans in the late 1700s led to the spread of smallpox and other diseases, which devastated the Atfalati population. In 1851, due to population pressures from white settlers, surviving members of the tribe negotiated a treaty with the Oregon Territory ceding their ancestral lands throughout the Tualatin Valley to guarantee a small reservation on the banks of nearby Wapato Lake. This treaty was never ratified, and in the late 1850s, the U.S. government relocated the tribe to the Grand Ronde Reservation.

Large-scale American settlement of the region began in the 1850s, due to the Donation Land Claim Act, which granted land to white settlers who moved to the Oregon Territory before 1855. In the 1870s, the West Side Railroad was built from Hillsboro to Corvallis, cutting through this region. The community of Gaston developed from a railroad stop in 1872 to a commercial center, hosting a school, post office, hotel, and blacksmith shop. Due to legal disputes, Joseph Gaston left his position at the railroad and moved to the region in 1880. He spent the next sixteen years attempting to drain Wapato Lake for farmland.

The nearby community of Cherry Grove was founded in 1911 as a logging hub and briefly eclipsed Gaston. Gaston was formally incorporated in 1914. By 1916, the town possessed a general store, bank, and other enterprises. In early May 1935 workers at the Stimson Mill went on strike. On May 22, activists left the Labor Temple in Portland to support the strikers. The next morning Oregon governor Charles Martin ordered the state police and National Guard to protect the strikebreakers. Armed with gas grenades and machine guns, the military and police forces demanded the strikers leave or be shot. The strikers chose to disperse, averting a potential bloodbath.

===New high school===
In 1915 a new high school was built on the land Joseph Gaston had previously set aside for a school. That high school was in use through the 1986–87 school year, when it was condemned. The condemning of the building became a crucial local issue for the town, with residents split between merging with a nearby district (both Forest Grove or Yamhill were considered), and building a new high school. In the end, a new high school was built and Gaston retained its independent school system and with it a degree of local pride. Currently the Gaston School District is a full K–12 district, with 525 students total in 2007, and a single high school.

===Modern expansion===
The growing popularity of Portland and the Pacific Northwest in general has led to population growth throughout the region. Though too far from Portland to benefit much at first, recently Gaston has started to see new housing and an uptick in school registrations. The late 1980s brought a new fire station and the 1990s baseball/softball-oriented park. Just after 2000, a new post office was built on the edge of town. Thus far, the town has not been able to effectively capitalize on the local wine industry&#x27;s growing national and international recognition. In 2006, the mayoral candidate advocated obtaining state or federal funding to revitalize the commercial strip on Main Street which, in theory, could help the city capture some of the wine tourism dollars.

In 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began purchasing land in the Wapato Lake bed to reestablish the historic wetland.

<text>Hillsboro ( ) is a city in the U.S. state of Oregon and is the county seat of Washington County. Situated in the Tualatin Valley on the west side of the Portland metropolitan area, the city hosts many high-technology companies, such as Intel, locally known as the Silicon Forest. The population was 106,447 at the 2020 census, making Hillsboro the fifth-most populous city in Oregon.

Settlers founded a community here in 1842, later named after David Hill, an Oregon politician. Transportation by riverboat on the Tualatin River was part of Hillsboro&#x27;s settler economy. A railroad reached the area in the early 1870s and an interurban electric railway about four decades later. These railways, as well as highways, aided the slow growth of the city to about 2,000 people by 1910 and about 5,000 by 1950, before the arrival of high-tech companies in the 1980s.

Hillsboro has a council-manager government consisting of a city manager and a city council headed by a mayor. In addition to high-tech industry, sectors important to Hillsboro&#x27;s economy are health care, retail sales, and agriculture, including grapes and wineries. The city operates more than twenty parks and the mixed-use Hillsboro Stadium, and ten sites in the city are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Modes of transportation include private vehicles, public buses and light rail, and aircraft using the Hillsboro Airport. The city is home to Pacific University&#x27;s Health Professions Campus.

==History==
The European-American community was founded by David Hill, Isaiah Kelsey, and Richard Williams, who arrived in the Tualatin Valley in 1841, followed by six more pioneers in 1842. The locality went by two other names—East Tualatin Plains and Columbia—before it was named &quot;Hillsborough&quot; in February 1850 in honor of Hill, when he sold part of his land claim to the county. On February 5, 1850, commissioners chosen by the territorial legislature selected the community to be the seat of the county government. Hill was to be paid $200 for his land after plots had been sold for the town site, but he died before this occurred, and his widow Lucinda received the funds. The town&#x27;s name was later simplified to Hillsboro. A log cabin was built in 1853 to serve as the community&#x27;s first school, which opened in October 1854. Riverboats provided transportation to Hillsboro as early as 1867 when the side-wheel steamer &quot;Yamhill&quot; worked on the Tualatin River.

In 1871, the Oregon and California Railroad line was extended to the area, but it ran just south of town because the city did not want to give the railroad land in exchange for the rail connection. Hillsboro was incorporated as the Town of Hillsboro on October 19, 1876, by the Oregon Legislature. The first mayor was A. Luelling, who took office on December 8, 1876, and served a one-year term. Notable later mayors included Congressman Thomas H. Tongue (1882 and 1886) and state senator William D. Hare (1885). In 1923, the city altered its charter and adopted a council-manager government with a six-person city council, a part-time mayor who determined major policies, and a city manager who ran day-to-day operations.

On September 30, 1908, 5,000 people gathered as the Oregon Electric Railway opened a connection between the city and Portland with an interurban electric rail line, the first to reach the community. In January 1914, the Southern Pacific Railroad introduced its own interurban service, known as the Red Electric, on a separate line and serving different communities between Hillsboro and Portland. SP discontinued its Hillsboro service on July 28, 1929, while the Oregon Electric Railway&#x27;s passenger service to Hillsboro lasted until July 1932.

A brick building was constructed in 1852 to house the county government, followed by a brick courthouse in 1873. In 1891, the courthouse was remodeled and a clock tower was added, and the building was expanded with an annex in 1912. A new courthouse replaced the brick structure in 1928. The last major remodel of the 1928 structure occurred in 1972, when the Justice Services Building was built and incorporated into the existing building.

The city&#x27;s first fire department was a hook and ladder company organized in 1880 by the board of trustees (now city council). A drinking water and electricity distribution system added in 1892–93 gave the town three fire hydrants and minimal street lighting. Hillsboro built its first sewer system in 1911, but sewage treatment was not added until 1936. In 1913, the city built its own water system, and the first library, Carnegie City Library, opened in December 1914. From 1921 to 1952, the world&#x27;s second-tallest radio tower stood on the south side of the city, but in 1952, the wireless telegraph tower was demolished. During the 1950s and 1960s, the privately owned company Tualatin Valley Buses, Inc., provided transit service connecting Hillsboro with Beaverton and Portland. It was taken over by the publicly owned transit agency TriMet in 1970.

In 1972, the Hillsboro City Council passed a Green River Ordinance banning door-to-door solicitation, but it was ruled unconstitutional by the Oregon Supreme Court in a 1988 decision. The court determined that the city ordinance was overly broad, in a case that was seen as a test case for many similar laws in the state. In 1979, Intel opened its first facility inAloha, Or . The Aloha campus was followed by the Hawthorn Farms, then Jones Farm campus adjacent to the airport in 1982, and finally by the Ronler Acres campus in 1994. TriMet opened a Metropolitan Area Express (MAX) light rail line into the city in 1998. A cultural center was added in 2004, and a new city hall was completed in 2005. In 2008, SolarWorld opened a facility producing solar wafers, crystals, and cells, the largest plant of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. U.S. President Barack Obama visited the city and Intel&#x27;s Ronler Acres campus in February 2011.

==Geography==
The United States Census Bureau reports the city has a total area of , all of which is land. In 2013, Hillsboro itself reported an area of , equivalent to . The city is located in the Tualatin Valley, and the Tualatin River forms part of the southern city limits. The city&#x27;s terrain is fairly level, consistent with an agricultural past and the farms still in operation. Hillsboro is about west of Portland and immediately west of Beaverton, at an elevation of above sea level. In addition to the Tualatin River, streams include Dairy Creek, McKay Creek, Rock Creek, Dawson Creek, and Turner Creek. Neighboring communities in addition to Beaverton are Aloha, Cornelius, Glencoe, North Plains, Reedville, Scholls, and West Union.

Hillsboro&#x27;s street system differs from many others in the county. Most cities in Washington County use a numbering system and cardinal direction orientation based on a grid that begins at the Willamette River in downtown Portland, which was originally part of Washington County. For example, the street names in Beaverton generally include Southwest (SW) prefixes because Beaverton lies in the southwest quadrant of the Portland grid. Previously, some county road names and addresses in Hillsboro conformed to the Portland grid instead of Hillsboro&#x27;s internal cardinal direction grid. In January 2015, the city began the process of making all addresses and streets within Hillsboro conform to the internal grid, through the Connecting Hillsboro Address Project.

The internal grid in Hillsboro centers on the downtown intersection of Main Street, which runs east–west, and First Avenue, which runs north–south. Most addresses within the city include a quadrant prefix: NW, NE, SW, or SE. Main Street is simply designated as East Main or West Main, and First Avenue is only North First or South First. Addresses on the streets&#x27; south side and the avenues&#x27; east side have even numbers, while odd numbers are on the opposite side. Hillsboro&#x27;s street system contains 20 blocks per mile (12.5 blocks per kilometer).

North–south through roadways are called &quot;avenues&quot;, while east–west roadways are called &quot;streets&quot;. All cul-de-sacs are named &quot;courts&quot;. Private roadways are named &quot;ways&quot; or &quot;places&quot;. Roads that curve can be named &quot;drives&quot;. Alleys are named &quot;lanes&quot;. Non-city streets may not conform to these naming conventions.

===Neighborhoods===

The city&#x27;s municipal code has designated several special plan areas, each of which follow area-specific plans and codes:

*Downtown encompasses the original city core and the area immediately surrounding it. Blocks in the downtown core are long on each side. 
*Orenco consists of the Orenco Townsite Conservation zone (encompassing a former company town originally created by the Oregon Nursery Company) and the Orenco Station sub-area, which is described in the city code as a &quot;compact, transit-supportive mixed-use neighborhood with reduced automobile reliance&quot;.
*The Hawthorn Farm / Fair Complex Plan District is centered on the Hawthorn Farm LRT station and the Washington County Fairgrounds (known since 2019 as the Westside Commons).
*Amberglen, located just south of the Tanasbourne neighborhood, is envisioned as &quot;a vibrant, regional activity center enlivened with high-quality pedestrian and environmental amenities, taking advantage of the region’s light rail system&quot;. Located within the district is Oregon Health &amp; Science University&#x27;s West Campus.
*The South Hillsboro planning district encompasses the newly annexed South Hillsboro neighborhood, described in the city code as &quot;a complete, connected and green community&quot;. The neighborhood, built on land once used as a hobby farm by William Ladd and Simeon Reed, is slated to become &quot;a residential mixed-use community organized around a town center and complemented by a village center&quot;.
*The North Hillsboro Industrial Area Plan District lies within Hillsboro&#x27;s Industrial District, where many of the Silicon Forest&#x27;s manufacturing and technology businesses reside. Over half of the city&#x27;s total employment is located within the Hillsboro Industrial District. 
*The city&#x27;s Comprehensive Plan outlines several other plan areas not defined in the city code: Quatama, Tanasbourne, NE 28th Ave/East Main Street Plan Area, and Witch Hazel Village.

Historically, the city&#x27;s longtime newspaper of record was the weekly &quot;Hillsboro Argus&quot; newspaper (published twice-weekly from 1953 to 2015). It was published in Hillsboro for more than 120 years until its discontinuation in 2017.

The city is also served by Portland-based media outlets, including &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, &quot;Willamette Week&quot;, and all broadcast stations.
Local FM radio station KQRZ-LP airing Oldies on 100.7 MHz is licensed by the FCC to Hillsboro and is simulcast on 96.7 MHz KICN-LP. AM radio station KUIK was based in Hillsboro until sold in 2018. KUIK was a 5,000-watt station broadcasting at the 1360 frequency.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Public transportation is available by bus and light rail, managed by regional transit agency TriMet. The first MAX Light Rail line, now known as the Blue Line, was extended to serve Hillsboro on September 12, 1998. The western terminus is located downtown. The Willow Creek and Hillsboro transit centers (TC) are the main hubs of the public transit system, although seven other MAX stations provide varying degrees of bus interconnection. MAX stations (west to east) are the , Hillsboro Central TC, Hillsboro Health District, Washington/Southeast 12th Avenue, Hillsboro Airport/Fairgrounds, , Orenco, , and Willow Creek TC. Located next to the Tuality Hospital station is the Hillsboro Intermodal Transit Facility, which opened in 2010 and was jointly paid for by the hospital, Pacific University, and the city. The facility is primarily a parking garage, but includes lockers and showers for bicyclists along with electric vehicle charging stations. The MAX Red Line was also extended in 2024 from Beaverton Transit Center to the Fairgrounds station.

Freight rail service from Portland and Western Railroad with interconnections to the BNSF Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad both serve Hillsboro. The city is not served by passenger rail service over a heavy-rail line. Air travel is available at the Hillsboro Airport in the center of the city and at Stark&#x27;s Twin Oaks Airpark, a general aviation field south of the city. The Hillsboro Airport is a general aviation airport operated by the Port of Portland, and is the second-busiest airport in the state after Portland International Airport. The airport mainly serves private pilots and corporate flights, with no scheduled airline flights from its two runways, but does have an on-call customs service.

Oregon Route 8, known locally as the Tualatin Valley Highway (TV Highway), is the primary east–west highway. U.S. Route 26, also known as the Sunset Highway, bisects the northeast corner of the city. Other major east–west roads are Cornell Road and Main Street (formerly Baseline Road). Major north–south routes are Oregon Route 219 / 1st Avenue, 10th Avenue, Cornelius Pass Road, and Brookwood Parkway. The easternmost north–south route, 185th Avenue, borders Beaverton and runs between the Tanasbourne Town Center and the rest of Hillsboro. TV Highway connects to Cornelius and Forest Grove to the west and Beaverton to the east.

===Services===
Hillsboro operates its own library system, fire department, parks department, water system, police department, and municipal internet service. The Hillsboro Fire Department has five stations, and the Hillsboro Police Department operates two standard precincts and a mobile precinct. Wastewater treatment is provided through the county-wide Clean Water Services. The city&#x27;s municipal internet service, HiLight, was initially launched in 2020 and expects to cover all households by 2027.

===Health care===
Hospital services in the city are provided by Hillsboro Medical Center (formerly Tuality Community Hospital) in the downtown area of the city. Opened in 1918 as the city&#x27;s first hospital, the 167-bed facility is operated by Tuality Healthcare. Other significant medical facilities include Kaiser Permanente&#x27;s Sunset Medical Office and Providence Health &amp; Services&#x27; immediate care center, both in the Tanasbourne neighborhood. Kaiser Permanente also opened the Kaiser Westside Medical Center, a 126-bed hospital in 2013, next to its Sunset Medical Office. The Department of Veterans Affairs opened a medical clinic in the Tanasbourne area in 2008.

==Notable people==
For more than 150 years, the city has had residents as varied as David Hill, the city&#x27;s founder, to Tiffeny Milbrett, an Olympic and World Cup champion soccer player. Sydney Collins is a player for the Canada national soccer team. Two governors of Oregon, James Withycombe and Paul L. Patterson, have called the city home. Other politicians included Congressmen Thomas H. Tongue and Samuel Thurston; mayors William N. Barrett, Benjamin P. Cornelius, and William D. Hare, patriarch of the Hare political family. Athletes include Erik Ainge, Scott Brosius, Colt Lyerla, Ad Rutschman, Wes Schulmerich, Wally Backman, and Olympic medalists Josh Inman, Thomas Garrigus, and Jean Saubert. Hillsboro has also been home to Peggy Y. Fowler, the former chief executive officer of Portland General Electric, producer Bryce Zabel, the &quot;Mother Queen of Oregon&quot; Mary Ramsey Wood, Tommy Overstreet, musician Esperanza Spalding and professional wrestler Roddy Piper.

==Sister city==
Hillsboro&#x27;s only sister city relationship is with Fukuroi, a city of about 85,000 residents in the Shizuoka Prefecture in central Japan. The cities, which have similar economic bases in agriculture and high technology, began their relationship in November 1988. The relationship has included exchanges of students between schools in each city. In the late 2000s, Hillsboro unsuccessfully explored finding a sister city in Mexico and also neglected the relationship with Fukuroi. However, in 2008, a Fukuroi contingent of adults visited Hillsboro to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Sister City agreement.

<text>King City is a city in Washington County, Oregon, United States. Its name was picked by the Tualatin Development Company, Inc., which used a royalty theme in naming the city streets.

Future expansion to the west is planned for the city, within the limits of the Portland Metropolitan Urban Growth Boundary.

<text>Moonshine is high-proof liquor, traditionally made or distributed illegally. The name was derived from a tradition of distilling the alcohol at night to avoid detection. In the first decades of the 21st century, commercial distilleries have adopted the term for its outlaw cachet and have begun producing their own legal &quot;moonshine&quot;, including many novelty flavored varieties, that are said to continue the tradition by using a similar method and/or locale of production.

In 2013, moonshine accounted for about one-third of global alcohol consumption.

==Terminology==
Different languages and countries have their own terms for moonshine .

==Fractional crystallization==
The ethanol may be concentrated in fermented beverages by means of freezing. For example, the name &quot;applejack&quot; derives from the traditional method of producing the drink, &quot;&quot;, the process of freezing fermented cider and then removing the ice, increasing the alcohol content. Starting with the fermented juice, with an alcohol content of less than ten percent, the concentrated result can contain 25–40% alcohol by volume (ABV).

==Moonshine stills==
In some countries, moonshine stills are illegal to sell, import, and own without permission. However, enthusiasts explain on internet forums how to obtain equipment and assemble it into a still. To cut costs, stainless steel vessels are often replaced with plastic stills, vessels made from polypropylene that can withstand relatively high heat.

* A column still, or a spiral still, can achieve a vapor alcohol content of 95% ABV.
* Moonshine is usually distilled to 40% ABV, and seldom above 66% based on 48 samples. For example, conventional pot stills commonly produce 40% ABV, and top out between 60% and 80% ABV after multiple distillations. However, ethanol can be dried to 95% ABV by heating 3A molecular sieves such as 3A zeolite.

The preferred heat source for plastic stills or spiral stills is &quot;sous vide&quot; sticks; these control temperature, time, and circulation, and are therefore preferred over immersion heaters. Multiple units can be used to increase the wattage. Also, &quot;sous vide&quot; sticks, commonly sold in 1200 W and generally temperature regulated up to (ethanol boils at ), will evaporate the ethanol faster than an immersion heater, commonly sold in 300 W. Electrical injury may occur if immersion heaters are modified, such as if a thermostat is removed from an aquarium heater (because doing so may break its waterproofing), or if an immersion heater is disassembled from an electric water boiler.

===Evaporation stills===
====Plastic still====
A plastic still is a device for distillation specially adapted for separating ethanol and water. Plastic stills are common because they are cheap and easy to manufacture. The principle is that a smaller amount of liquid is placed in an open smaller vessel inside a larger one that is closed. A cheap 100 W immersion heater is typically used as heat source, but a thermal immersion circulator, like a &quot;sous vide&quot; stick is ideal because it comes with a temperature controller. The liquid is kept heated at about which slowly evaporates the ethanol to 40% ABV that condense on the inner walls of the outer vessel. The condensation that accumulates in the bottom of the vessel can then be diverted directly down through a filter containing activated carbon. The final product has approximately twice as much alcohol content as the starting liquid and can be distilled several times if stronger distillate is desired. The method is slow, and is not suitable for large-scale production.

===Boiling stills===

====Fractional distillation====
Fractional distillation is the separation of a mixture into its component parts, or fractions. Chemical compounds are separated by heating them to a temperature at which one or more fractions of the mixture will vaporize. It uses distillation to fractionate. Generally the component parts have boiling points that differ by less than 25 °C (45 °F) from each other under a pressure of one atmosphere.

=====Column still=====

A column still, also called a continuous still, patent still or Coffey still, is a variety of still consisting of two columns. A column still can achieve a vapor alcohol content of 95% ABV.

======Spiral still======
A spiral still is a type of column still with a simple slow air-cooled distillation apparatus, commonly used for bootlegging. Column and cooler consist of a copper tube wound in spiral form. The tube first goes up to act as a simple column, and then down to cool the product. Cookware usually consists of a plastic wine bucket. The heat source is typically a thermal immersion circulator (commonly runs at 1200 W), like a &quot;sous vide stick&quot; because it is hard to find 300 W immersion heaters, and it is risky to disassemble the immersion heater from an electric water boiler because it may cause electrical injury. The spiral burner is popular because, despite its simple construction and low manufacturing cost, it can provide 95% ABV.

====Pot still====
A pot still is a type of distillation apparatus or still used to distill flavored liquors such as whisky or cognac, but not rectified spirit because they are poor at separating congeners. Pot stills operate on a batch distillation basis (as opposed to a Coffey or column stills, which operate on a continuous basis). Traditionally constructed from copper, pot stills are made in a range of shapes and sizes depending on quantity and style of spirit. Geographic variations in still design exist, with certain kinds popular in parts of Appalachia, a region known for moonshine distilling.

Spirits distilled in pots commonly have 40% ABV, and top out between 60 and 80% after multiple distillations.

== Safety ==
Poorly produced moonshine can be contaminated, mainly from materials used in the construction of the still. Stills employing automotive radiators as condensers are particularly dangerous; in some cases, glycol produced from antifreeze can be a problem.

The head that comes immediately after the foreshot (the initial product of the still) typically contains small amounts of other undesirable compounds, such as acetone and various aldehydes. Fusel alcohols are other undesirable byproducts of fermentation that are contained in the &quot;aftershot,&quot; and are also typically discarded.

Alcohol concentrations at higher strengths (the GHS identifies concentrations above 24% ABV as dangerous) are flammable and therefore dangerous to handle. This is especially true during the distilling process, when vaporized alcohol may accumulate in the air to dangerous concentrations if adequate ventilation is not provided.

===Adulterated moonshine===
Contaminated moonshine can occur if proper materials and techniques are not used. The prolonged consumption of impure moonshine may cause renal disease, primarily from increased lead content.

====Heavy metals====
Analysis of Georgia moonshine samples revealed potentially toxic levels of copper, zinc, lead, and arsenic. A review of twelve arsenic poisoning cases found contaminated moonshine responsible for about half, suggesting it may be a significant source in some areas.

=====Lead=====
Radiators used as condensers may contain lead at the plumbing joints, and their use has resulted in blindness or lead poisoning from tainted liquor. This was a deadly hazard during the Prohibition-era United States. Consumption of lead-tainted moonshine is a serious risk factor for saturnine gout, a very painful but treatable medical condition that damages the kidneys and joints.

The incidence of impure moonshine has been documented to significantly increase the risk of renal disease among those who regularly consume it, primarily from increased lead content.

====Methanol====
Contamination is still possible by unscrupulous distillers using cheap methanol to increase the apparent strength of the product. Moonshine can be made both more palatable and perhaps less dangerous by discarding the &quot;foreshot&quot; – the first of alcohol that drip from the condenser. Because methanol vaporizes at a lower temperature than ethanol, it is commonly believed that the foreshot contains most of the methanol, if any, from the mash. However, research shows that methanol is present until the very end of the distillation run. Despite this, distillers will usually collect the foreshots until the temperature of the still reaches .

Outbreaks of methanol poisoning have occurred from methanol accidentally produced in moonshine production or deliberately used to strengthen it.

=====Purification=====
In modern times, reducing methanol with the absorption of a molecular sieve is a practical method for production.

=====Methanol safety by fermentation ingredient=====
* Grain starches: Methanol is not produced in toxic amounts by fermentation of sugars from grain starches.
* Methanol is produced in the fermentation of fruits via the action of pectin methylesterase, while of regulatory concern this does not typically exceed toxic levels and poisonings typically occur from methanol addition (e.g. as a lacing agent).

=== Tests ===

====Alcohols====
The Lucas test in alcohols is a test to differentiate between primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols. It can be used to detect the levels of fusel alcohols.

====Strength====

A quick estimate of the alcoholic strength, or proof, of the distillate (the ratio of alcohol to water) is often achieved by shaking a clear container of the distillate. Large bubbles with a short duration indicate a higher alcohol content, while smaller bubbles that disappear more slowly indicate lower alcohol content.

A more reliable method is to use an alcoholmeter or hydrometer. A hydrometer is used during and after the fermentation process to determine the potential alcohol percentage of the moonshine, whereas an alcoholmeter is used after the product has been distilled to determine the volume percent or proof.

===Misconceptions===
A common folk test for the quality of moonshine was to pour a small quantity of it into a spoon and set it on fire. The theory was that a safe distillate burns with a blue flame, but a tainted distillate burns with a yellow flame. Practitioners of this simple test also held that if a radiator coil had been used as a condenser, then there would be lead in the distillate, which would give a reddish flame. This led to the mnemonic, &quot;Lead burns red and makes you dead,&quot; or simply, &quot;Red means dead.&quot;

== Legality ==
Manufacturing of spirits through distilling, fractional crystallization, etc. outside a registered distillery is illegal in many countries.

===USA===
Currently in the United States, there are four states that allow the production of moonshine for personal consumption (Alaska, Arizona, Massachusetts, and Missouri). Additionally, North Dakota law permits the production of moonshine for personal consumption up to the federally legal amountwhich is zero gallons; entailing that production of any amount is illegal. 
==Society and culture==
Popular offerings for the Maya deity and folk saint Maximón include money, tobacco, and moonshine.

==History==


Moonshine is by tradition usually a clear, unaged whiskey, once made with barley mash in Scotland and Ireland or maize corn mash in the United States, though plain sugar became just as common in illicit liquor during the last century. The word originated in the British Isles as a result of excise laws and became meaningful in the United States only after a tax passed after the Revolutionary War outlawing non-registered stills with the Tariff of 1791, or the Excise Whiskey Tax of 1791. This tax led to the Whiskey Rebellion lasting between 1791 and 1794, where the tax went unpaid by the rebels and was met with violent protest. This tax lasted until 1802, when it was repealed. Another tax was introduced with the Revenue Act of 1861 and Revenue Act of 1862 that heavily taxed the production of spirits leading to an increase in illegal distilling and in turn, increased action from revenue agents that enforced the taxes. Illegal distilling accelerated during the Prohibition era (1920–1933), which mandated a total ban on alcohol production under the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution. Since the amendment was repealed in 1933, laws focus on evasion of taxation on any type of spirits or intoxicating liquors. Applicable laws were historically enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives of the US Department of Justice, but are now usually handled by state agencies. Enforcement agents were once known colloquially as &quot;revenuers&quot;.

===Etymology===
The earliest known instance of the term &quot;moonshine&quot; being used to refer to illicit alcohol dates to the 1785 edition of &quot;Grose&#x27;s Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue&quot;, which was published in England. Prior to that, &quot;moonshine&quot; referred to anything &quot;illusory&quot; or to literally the light of the moon. The U.S. Government considers the word a &quot;fanciful term&quot; and does not regulate its use on the labels of commercial products, as such, legal moonshines may be any type of spirit, which must be indicated elsewhere on the label.

===Prohibition in the United States===

In Prohibition-era United States, moonshine distillation was done at night to deter discovery. While moonshiners were present in urban and rural areas around the United States after the Civil War, moonshine production concentrated in Appalachia because the limited road network made it easy to evade revenue officers and because it was difficult and expensive to transport corn crops. As a study of farmers in Cocke County, Tennessee, observes: &quot;One could transport much more value in corn if it was first converted to whiskey. One horse could haul ten times more value on its back in whiskey than in corn.&quot; Moonshiners such as Maggie Bailey of Harlan County, Kentucky, Amos Owens of Rutherford County, North Carolina, and Marvin &quot;Popcorn&quot; Sutton of Maggie Valley, North Carolina, became legendary.

Once the liquor was distilled, drivers called &quot;runners&quot; or &quot;bootleggers&quot; smuggled moonshine liquor across the region in cars specially modified for speed and load-carrying capacity. The cars were ordinary on the outside but modified with souped-up engines, extra interior room, and heavy-duty shock absorbers to support the weight of the illicit alcohol. After Prohibition ended, the out-of-work drivers kept their skills sharp through organized races, which led to the formation of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR). Several former &quot;runners,&quot; such as Junior Johnson, became noted drivers in the sport.

Some varieties of maize corn grown in the United States were once prized for their use in moonshine production. One such variety used in moonshine, Jimmy Red corn, a &quot;blood-red, flint-hard &#x27;dent&#x27; corn with a rich and oily germ,&quot; almost became extinct when the last grower died in 2000. Two ears of Jimmy Red were passed on to &quot;seed saver&quot; Ted Chewning, who saved the variety from extinction and began to produce it on a wider scale.

There have been modern-day attempts on the state level to legalize home distillation of alcohol, similar to how some states have been treating cannabis, despite there being federal laws prohibiting the practice. For example, the New Hampshire state legislature has tried repeatedly to pass laws allowing unlicensed home distillation of small batches. In 2023, Ohio introduced legislation to do the same, with other states likely to follow.

<text>Sherwood is a city in Washington County, Oregon, United States. Located in the southeast corner of the county, it is a residential community in the Tualatin Valley, southwest of Portland. The population was 20,450 at the 2020 census. Sherwood was first incorporated in 1893 as a town. Originally named Smockville after its founder, James Christopher Smock, the town was given its current name by local businessman Robert Alexander in 1891. The name &quot;Sherwood&quot; may have come from Sherwood, Michigan or the Sherwood Forest in England.

==History==

The name &quot;Sherwood&quot; came either after Sherwood Forest in England or Sherwood, Michigan In 1885, the Smocks gave a right-of-way on their property to the Portland and Willamette Valley Railway. The Smocks platted the town in 1889, the same year rail service began. Tradition has it that no one, not even the town&#x27;s founders, liked the name &quot;Smock Ville,&quot; and so a public meeting was held to rename the town. Robert Alexander, who was both a local resident and prominent businessman, suggested the name &quot;Sherwood.&quot; According to post office records, Alexander was from Sherwood, Michigan, and also said the forest which surrounded the city was like Sherwood Forest in England. The U.S. Postal Department began sending mail to the Town of Sherwood, Oregon, on July 5, 1891. Smock was the first postmaster. The Town of Sherwood was incorporated under Oregon Senate Bill 36 in 1893.

The main industry in the 1890s was a pressed brick yard which closed in 1896, a victim of the financial recession of 1893. The Klondike Gold Rush of 1897 revived Sherwood&#x27;s economy. In 2014, &quot;Money&quot; ranked Sherwood fifth among the top fifty best places to live in the United States.

The population of the city in 1911 was 350 within a city limit. The city has since expanded to nearly .

==History==
In 1850, Nathan B. Jones, a pioneer of 1847, settled at the head of Tanner Creek and platted lots for a community he called &quot;Zion Town&quot;. It is unknown if he named the place for Mount Zion, a summit located about a mile to the southeast. Because the name &quot;Zion&quot; for a local post office would have caused confusion, as there had already been two post offices so-named in Oregon, a resident suggested the name &quot;Sylvan&quot;, from the Roman deity of the woods &quot;Silvanus&quot;. The office was established in 1890 and it closed in 1906. Jones, who was considered an eccentric hermit, had wanted Zion Town to become the new capitol of Oregon. He was murdered during the course of a robbery in 1894. Sylvan post office was located at what today is the interchange of Sunset Highway, Scholls Ferry Road and Skyline Boulevard within the Portland city limits in Multnomah County.

<text>Fossil is a city in and the county seat of Wheeler County, Oregon, United States. The name was chosen by the first postmaster, Thomas B. Hoover, who had found some fossil remains on his ranch. The population was 473 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
The Fossil post office was established on February 28, 1876, on Thomas Benton Hoover&#x27;s ranch along Hoover Creek. He named the place &quot;Fossil&quot; after finding fossils in a clay-like rock formation on his ranch. In 1881, Hoover and Thomas Watson opened a store near the confluence of Butte and Cottonwood creeks and moved the post office to the store. When the city was incorporated in 1891, Hoover became the first mayor.

After creating Wheeler County in 1899, the Oregon Legislature chose Fossil as the temporary county seat. A county-wide election held in 1900 to determine the permanent county seat yielded 436 votes for Fossil, 267 for Twickenham, and 82 for Spray.

Winlock W. Steiwer and George S. Carpenter founded Steiwer &amp; Carpenter Bank, the first bank in the city and the county. By the early 20th century in addition to the bank, Fossil had a flour mill, a blacksmith shop, a drug store, a jewelry and optical store, a livery stable, and three stores with general merchandise. In the 1920s, William Jennings Bryan was one of the guest speakers at a Chautauqua meeting in Fossil. Later in the decade the John Day Valley Coal &amp; Oil Company drilled an exploratory oil well within the city limits, but it was not successful.

<text>Mitchell is a city in Wheeler County, Oregon, United States. The population was 130 at the 2010 census. It was founded in 1873 and was named after John H. Mitchell, a politician.

The Painted Hills unit of the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument is about northwest of Mitchell. Mitchell School, a public school with an enrollment of about 70 students, is in Mitchell.

==History==
===Foundation===
At the request of William &quot;Brawdie&quot; Johnson, a blacksmith, a post office was established at Mitchell in 1873. Johnson, the first postmaster, suggested the name &quot;Mitchell&quot; after John Hipple Mitchell, a U.S. Senator from Oregon. Senator Mitchell held the office in 1873−1879, 1885−1897, and 1901−1905. Platted in 1885, the community was incorporated in 1893.

In 1872 the first school in Wheeler County was established near Mitchell, and in 1874 it was relocated into the town itself.

===Early town===
Over the next two decades, Mitchell grew to include a store, assay office, two churches, two hotels, a livery stable, three houses of ill-repute (one of which is still standing), five saloons, a flour mill, and an apothecary. There were also two newspapers: &quot;The Sentinel&quot; and &quot;The News&quot;.

The business district, including the saloons, grew up along Bridge Creek and became known locally as &quot;Tiger Town&quot;. The church and most of the city&#x27;s homes were built at higher elevation on a bench overlooking the creek; this part of town was known locally as &quot;Piety Hill&quot;. About half the town was destroyed by fire in 1899, but it was later rebuilt.

===Three catastrophic flash floods===
Since its founding, Mitchell has experienced three catastrophic flash floods along Bridge Creek, which runs through the center of the city. Flooding caused great damage to the city in 1884 and 1904.

The third flood occurred on July 13, 1956, shortly after an intense thunderstorm in the hills to the south. Bridge Creek is usually less than deep during July, but minutes after the thunderstorm a wall of water surged through Mitchell, destroying or heavily damaging 20 buildings in the city and several bridges over the creek. Eight people were killed including a family of four who were swept away and never recovered.

An observer from the United States Geological Survey estimated that about of rain had fallen in about 50 minutes at the storm&#x27;s center. Total damage from the flood, which also caused extensive damage to crops and roads in a nearby valley, was .

===Oregon&#x27;s first dinosaur fossil===
In 2018, a geologist from the University of Oregon found a fossilized toe of a plant-eating dinosaur near Mitchell, where the Pacific Ocean coast lay 100 million years ago. This discovery has been billed as the first dinosaur fossil found in Oregon.

A competing claim involves fossil fragments of a hadrosaur or duck-billed dinosaur found in the Otter Point Formation near the mouth of the Rogue River.

==Geography and climate==
Mitchell, in southwestern Wheeler County, is on U.S. Route 26 just east of its intersection with Oregon Route 207. By highway, the city is east of Prineville and west of John Day. To the city&#x27;s south lie the Ochoco Mountains, the source of Bridge Creek. It flows through Mitchell and then north through the Painted Hills to the John Day River.

Eroded remnants of ancient stratovolcanoes, once the size of Mount Hood are nearby; these include Black Butte and White Butte, visible from town.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Precipitation in the region is limited by the rain shadow effect of the Cascade Range and the Ochoco Mountains to the west. In winter, much of the precipitation arrives as snow.

<doc id="131022" wikidata="Q932375" url="?curid=131022" title="Carlton, Oregon">
<text>Carlton is a city in Yamhill County, Oregon, United States. The population was 2,135 as of the 2020 Census.

==History==


The origin of Carlton&#x27;s name is disputed. An ex-county commissioner claims that the name was derived from Wilson Carl, whereas A. E. Bones, postmaster at Carlton, stated in a 1925 letter that it was named for John Carl Sr., at the request of R. R. Thompson. These men may have been part of the same family.

Carlton post office was established in 1874, with F. J. Fryer serving as its first postmaster.

Prior to the post office inside the city of Carlton, Wilson Carl owned the original post office, stagecoach stop, and blacksmith shop for the area, about west of Carlton, and his home was known as Mountain House. Wilson Carl was the original postmaster. Wilson Carl traveled with Dr. Joel Knight on the Oregon Trail to the area, as witnessed in the diary of Amelia Stewart Knight. Wilson Carl negotiated with the railroad in Portland, Oregon, to build closer to his property. Since the original plot was over the mountain West of Carlton, it was a matter of convenience for the railroad to build where it presently is, because negotiating the mountain was not feasible. The population of Carlton expanded to become the city of Carlton, around the railroad. The city is named after Wilson Carl, and was originally called Carl&#x27;s town. A few other variations of his name were used before the name became Carlton. Wilson Carl began as a pioneer carpenter/builder and shoemaker who became a wealthy land owner, who built a portion of what is now Linfield College, in McMinnville, and was founder of the Republican Party in McMinnville, County Commissioner, and, at one time owned the property that the Yamhill County Courthouse presently sits on. The original post office still exists on his original homestead and plot of land, though it has since been used as a residence for his heirs and is currently unoccupied. There is further information about the name variations used for Carlton, in a former Oregon Blue Book.

There, Highway 233 continued northeast along SE Kreder Road to its northern terminus at what was then numbered as US Route 99W. During this period, the northern terminus of Highway 221 was located at its intersection with Ferry Street.

<text>Dundee is a city in Yamhill County, Oregon, United States. The population was 3,238 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Dundee was named after Dundee, Scotland, the birthplace of William Reid. Reid came to Oregon in 1874 to establish the Oregonian Railway, and made several extensions to the railroad in the western Willamette Valley.

The first post office in the area, established in 1881, was called Ekins. The Ekins post office was closed in 1885, and in 1887 a new office opened and was named &quot;Dundee Junction.&quot; The name was chosen in anticipation of plans to build a bridge across the Willamette River for the railroad, which would have called for a junction at Dundee between the west railroad and the new east railroad. The bridge was never built, however, and the post office was renamed &quot;Dundee&quot; in 1897.

In 1913, the Dundee Woman&#x27;s Club was founded and later established a community center.

==History==
Town founder William T. Newby joined the Great Migration of 1843, of people from the eastern states to the west. He later claimed land in 1844 on the present site of McMinnville in what was known as the Oregon Country. He built a grist mill in 1853 at what would become the west end of Third Street. On May 5, 1856, Newby platted a town and named it after his hometown of McMinnville, Tennessee. The plat was not recorded until July 1865, despite Newby receiving his U.S. patent in October 1858.

The Baptists opened a private school in 1849, which was chartered as the Baptist College in 1858 under the territorial government. This school was later named McMinnville College after founder Newby made a substantial donation of land to support founding an institution of higher learning in the town. It received a substantial property donation from Frances R. Linfield, the widow of Reverend George F. Linfield. It was originally called McMinnville College. It is known today as Linfield University.

McMinnville was incorporated as a town in 1876 and became a city in 1882. County residents voted to move the county seat of Yamhill County from Lafayette to McMinnville in 1886.

Michelbook Country Club, a private 18-hole par 72 championship golf course, was developed on the farmland of Captain Francis Michelbook. Land development in the area of the country club has been a factor in McMinnville&#x27;s growth in the late 20th century. In the early 1960s, Kelton Peery, Chuck Colvin and Willard Cushing believed it was time for the city to have a private golf course and began to search for property. They soon persuaded Captain Francis Michelbook, former Commander of the Oregon National Guard&#x27;s Third Infantry Company A, that a country club would be the proper use for his land. Captain Michelbook established certain conditions: the country club would bear his family name &quot;Michelbook&quot;. The country club has a driving range, practice facility, golf shop and a Class A PGA Professional.

McMinnville Community Center is headquarters for the McMinnville Parks and Recreation Department, which administers 18 parks throughout the city. The largest city park is the 100-acre sports field complex and community park named after a longtime city manager Joe Dancer. The city of McMinnville administers youth sports leagues in both baseball and basketball, along with many other competitive sports.

For instance, Joe Dancer Park has a dozen baseball and softball fields. The park also features soccer fields, playground equipment, and the Drew Ottley Memorial Skate Park.

This 22-acre community park has picnic shelters (available to rent), playgrounds, play structure w/towers, climbing walls, climbing boulders, water features, basketball courts, and walking pathways (1 mile paved) and trails (.95 mile soft) throughout.

City Park is within walking distance from the downtown business district. It opened in 1910, when the city sold $3,000 in park bonds to finance construction of a bandstand and a small zoo featuring bears, deer and other regional animals. Near the site of Lower City Park, the large flour mill, Star Mill, operated until 1921. After the remaining structure was damaged by fire in 1927, the city sold $8,500 in bonds to finance purchase of the property. The tract ran from Star Mill Way to Cozine Creek and West Second Street, to the mill pond site. The pond site was redeveloped as city tennis courts.

Wortman Park is a large forested park with a small stream running through it. A disc golf course was installed 1991 and is home to the annual Squirrel Open, an Oregon Disc Sports Association&#x27;s Oregon Series tournament.

==Education==
Along with several private schools, the city enjoys a growing school district and two institutions of higher education, Chemeketa Community College and Linfield University.

In 1858, Linfield University was founded as Baptist College of McMinnville. Later renamed McMinnville College and then Linfield College, in 2020 the Board of Trustees renamed the school Linfield University. Linfield is an independent, comprehensive institution of higher education for undergraduate and graduate studies in 56 unique majors. The university enrolls roughly 2,000 students from 24 states with nearly 95% of students utilizing financial aid.

Linfield University is located on nearly 200 acres with over 60 facilities. The Linfield University athletic program is part of the Northwest Conference, NCAA Division III rostering varsity sports, along with intercollegiate sports and activities. In 2020 the football program upgraded their facility with the largest scoreboard in NCAA Division III. The 1,800 square foot display measures in at 60 feet wide and 30 feet high. The football program notched its 64th consecutive winning season in 2019.

In the mid to late 1970s community locations for Chemeketa Community College expanded to McMinnville. Chemeketa Yamhill Valley received accreditation as a college campus in the fall of 2011, and McMinnville became the home of the second multi-campus community college in the state of Oregon. The Yamhill Valley campus provides numerous services including; academic advising, counseling support services, student clubs and activities, student accessibility services, library/tutoring centers, and open computer labs.

Nearly two decades after McMinnville College was founded, the city of McMinnville levied a tax to build the first public school house. The McMinnville School District is responsible for the education of nearly 7,000 K-12 school children. The McMinnville School District superintendent is Debbie Brocket. The largest high school of the county, McMinnville High School (MHS), has an enrollment of over 2,000 students.

Children from outside of the city limits and unincorporated areas of Yamhill County attend McMinnville City Schools. The school district also bears the burden of oversight, administration, and maintenance of Wascher Elementary in the nearby community of Lafayette, Oregon.

Private schools in McMinnville include the Montessori School, McMinnville Christian Academy (MCA) and St. James Catholic Elementary School. The McMinnville Montessori School provides before and after school care utilizing Joe Dancer and City Parks.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
McMinnville is on Oregon Route 99W approximately south of downtown Portland and approximately north of Corvallis. Oregon Route 18 forms a bypass around the city along its southern border and connects McMinnville with the Oregon Coast just north of Lincoln City approximately west. Oregon Highway 18 is also known as Three Mile Lane from its McMinnville city center interchange east to the McMinnville Municipal Airport. The southern end of Oregon Route 47 is just northeast of city limits and connects McMinnville with Washington County.

Major thoroughfares in McMinnville are Highway 99W and Adams and Baker Streets which form a north–south couplet through the center of the town; Lafayette Avenue (which was at one time the route of U.S. Highway 99W), East Third Street (the main street through the downtown core), and West Second Street (the main street connecting downtown with the western residential areas). Baker Creek Road, Evans Street, Riverside Drive, South Davis Street, Fellows Street, Cypress Street and Booth Bend Road are also important collector streets connecting industrial or residential areas with the downtown core or the primary arterial streets.

McMinnville Municipal Airport is owned and operated by the City of McMinnville.

Since 1993, The Willamette &amp; Pacific Railroad (W&amp;P), doing business as the Portland &amp; Western Railroad (P&amp;W) serves McMinnville on its Westside Branch leased from the Union Pacific. Major railroad shippers include Cascade Steel Rolling Mills, Land O&#x27;Lakes Purina LLC, and McMinnville Gas. W&amp;P/P&amp;W maintains the historic 1912 Southern Pacific depot in downtown McMinnville, itself a remnant from the Southern Pacific Red Electric interurban passenger service which served McMinnville from 1914 until 1929. After demise of electrification, McMinnville depot continued in use for 64 years as Southern Pacific&#x27;s local headquarters until the railroad was leased to Willamette &amp; Pacific Railroad. McMinnville is a hub for P&amp;W, with trains operating between McMinnville and Newberg, Willamina, Dallas and Albany.

Historically, McMinnville had a landing for riverboats traveling up the Yamhill River. The Yamhill Lock near Lafayette helped facilitate river navigation up to McMinnville. However, the use of the Yamhill River for commercial purposes was short-lived; the city&#x27;s only recreational boat dock has been unusable for years. River levels are unpredictable and difficult for boaters (water levels can be very high in winter and very low in summer).

Public transit is provided by the Yamhill County Transit Area. Three city routes provide Monday–Friday service starting at 6:30 AM and continuing through 7:50 PM. A Saturday &quot;Loop&quot; runs from 10:00 AM through 6:00 PM. YCTA also provides intercity service to all communities in Yamhill County on four different routes; hourly weekday and infrequent Saturday service to Newberg and Tigard, and weekday commuter trips to Hillsboro and Salem.

Intercity bus service is also provided by Caravan Airport Transportation and Valley Retriever between Portland and Newport, each with one daily trip in each direction stopping in McMinnville. Greyhound Bus formerly served McMinnville until 2004 with a stop on its Portland–San Francisco route, ending nearly 80 years of service on the route dating back to the Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s rail and bus passenger service.

===Electricity and water===
Since 1888, the city has been served by McMinnville Water and Light, a municipal utility. Economic development experts cite low utility rates as an important recruiting effort with McMinnville offering the 2nd lowest electricity rates and the 3rd lowest water rates in the entire state.

===Health care===
Willamette Valley Medical Center, along the outskirts of McMinnville, is an 88-bed acute-care, full-service facility, accredited by The Joint Commission.

== McMinnville UFO photographs ==
McMinnville is well known among UFO buffs and researchers for photographs originally published on the front page of the June 9, 1950 edition of the city&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;News-Register&quot; (then known as the &quot;Telephone-Register&quot;), reportedly of an unidentified flying object; the photographs were taken nearly a month earlier, on May 11, 1950, at the farm of Paul and Evelyn Trent. &quot;The Oregonian&quot; published the photographs the next day, and were published in the June 26, 1950 issue of &quot;LIFE&quot; magazine.

Although these images have come to be known as the &quot;McMinnville UFO photographs&quot;, the Trent farm was actually located in Sheridan, Oregon, around nine miles (15 km) southwest of McMinnville. The heated debate which followed between UFO researchers and skeptics made the town&#x27;s name famous and has spurred an annual &quot;UFO Festival&quot; in McMinnville, the second largest such gathering in the United States to that of Roswell, New Mexico.

<text>Newberg is a city in Yamhill County, Oregon, United States. Located in the Portland metropolitan area, the city is home to George Fox University. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 25,138 making it the second most populous city in the county.

==History==

Ewing Young, after leading pioneering fur brigades in California, came to Portland in 1834 and settled on the west bank of the Willamette River near the mouth of Chehalem Creek, opposite of Champoeg. Young&#x27;s home is believed to be the first house built by European-Americans on that side of the river. Later, Joseph Rogers settled near the Willamette River at what is now Newberg in 1848. The community was known early on as Chehalem, and later as Roger&#x27;s Landing for Rogers who founded the settlement, and who died in 1855. In 1883, the community was platted. Incorporated in 1889, a community tradition states that this town was named by its first postmaster, Sebastian Brutscher, for his former hometown of Neuberg in Germany One of the current streets, Brutscher Street, is named after Brutscher.

Newberg was one of the first communities in Oregon to hold Quaker services. It was incorporated as a city in 1889. The city&#x27;s oldest surviving newspaper, &quot;The Newberg Graphic&quot;, was established Dec. 1, 1888. Friends Pacific Academy, renamed Pacific College in 1891 and then George Fox University in 1949, was founded by the Quakers in 1885. George Fox University is classified by U.S. News &amp; World Report as a first-tier regional university and &quot;Best Value&quot; school. The campus resides in the center of the city, surrounded by university-owned housing.

Herbert Hoover moved to the city in 1885, to live with his uncle and aunt after the death of his parents and was one of the first students to attend his uncle&#x27;s Pacific Academy. The home has been turned into the Hoover-Minthorn House museum.

The town was &quot;dry&quot;, meaning no alcohol could be sold within the city limits, for a good part of its early history.

A 1924 civil suit against the Newberg Ku Klux Klan was significant in the downfall of the Oregon Klan&#x27;s reputation. 

The first domesticated Llama was brought to Newberg in 1972, and the town quickly became the leader in llama breeding in the Pacific Northwest by 1982.

In addition to Llama breeding, Newberg became known as the “Scorpion Capital of the Pacific Northwest” after local pet shop owner Henry Brown started an ill fated business venture selling scorpions as novelty pets to the Portland metro region. Mr. Brown’s shop generated initial press due to its odd business model but was shuttered in 1977 when several terrariums failed, causing a brief but uneventful panic.

==Geography==
Newberg is located on Oregon Route 99W, approximately southwest of Portland. Springbrook, once a separate community, is now considered part of Newberg.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. It averages in elevation.

===Climate===

Newberg, like Portland, has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;) with cool and cloudy winters, and warm and dry summers. This climate is characterized by having overcast, wet, and changing weather conditions in fall, winter, and spring, as Newberg lies in the direct path of the stormy westerly flow, and mild and dry summers when the Pacific High reaches its northernmost point in mid summer. According to the Köppen climate classification, Newberg falls within the dry-summer temperate zone (&quot;Csb&quot;). with a USDA Plant Hardiness Zones between 8b and 9a. Other climate systems, such as the Trewartha climate classification, place it within the oceanic zone (&quot;Do&quot;), like much of the Pacific Northwest and Western Europe.

Winters are cool, cloudy, and rainy. The coldest months are December and January, with an average daily high of , although overnight lows usually remain above freezing by a few degrees. Evening temperatures fall to or below freezing 33 nights per year on average, but very rarely to or below . There are only 2.1 days per year where the daytime high temperature fails to rise above freezing. The lowest overnight temperature ever recorded was .

Annual snowfall in Newberg falls during the December-to-March time frame. Newport, for example, has more frequent snow than Portland, due in part to higher elevations near the West Hills and Mount Tabor, so can experience a dusting of snow while downtown Portland receives no accumulation at all.

Summers in Newberg are warm, occasionally hot, dry, and sunny, though the sunny warm weather is short-lived, from mid June through early September. The months of June, July, August and September account for a combined of total rainfall of the of the precipitation that falls throughout the year. The warmest month is July, with an average high temperature of . Because of its inland location from the coast, as well as the protective nature of the Oregon Coast Range to its west, Newberg summers are less susceptible to the moderating influence of the nearby Pacific Ocean. Consequently, Portland experiences heat waves on rare occasion, with temperatures rising into the for a few days. However, on average, temperatures reach or exceed on only 56 days per year, of which about 12 days will reach and only 1–2 days will reach .

Spring and fall can bring variable weather, including warm fronts that send temperatures surging above and cold snaps that plunge daytime temperatures into the 40s °F (4–9 °C). However, lengthy stretches of overcast days beginning in mid fall and continuing into mid spring are most common. Rain often falls as a light drizzle for several consecutive days at a time, contributing to 152 days on average with measurable (≥) precipitation annually.

<doc id="131028" wikidata="Q2107670" url="?curid=131028" title="Sheridan, Oregon">
<text>Sheridan is a town in Yamhill County, Oregon, United States. Platted in the 1860s when it received a post office, Sheridan was incorporated in 1880. In 1913, much of the town burned in a fire and a flood covered much of the community in 1964. The population of Sheridan 
as of the 2020 Census was 6,233, an increase from 6,127 at the 2010 census.

Located in the western part of the Willamette Valley, Sheridan is at the base of the Northern Oregon Coast Range along the South Yamhill River. Sheridan lies west of the county seat of McMinnville, along Oregon Route 18. This highway and Oregon Route 18 Business run east–west through Sheridan and nearby Willamina, parallel to the river. Sheridan Bridge is the only river crossing within Sheridan.

Sheridan&#x27;s largest employer is Federal Correctional Institution, Sheridan, a federal minimum and medium security prison. Sheridan has a Mayor–council form of government, with daily operations run by a city manager. The community has its own school district, with a single traditional high school. The main events each year in town are Sheridan Days and the Mud Drags, both held in June. Sheridan was named in honor of the American Civil War general Philip Henry Sheridan.

==History==
Absolem B. Faulconer laid out the plat for what became the city of Sheridan in the mid-1860s. This plat was recorded with the county on December 13, 1866. He had settled in the area in 1847. The Sheridan post office was established on April 4, 1866, with Absolem&#x27;s brother Thomas serving as postmaster. By 1871, the town had grown to include two blacksmith shops, one church, one school, one hotel, one wagon shop, and two general stores. In October 1878, the Dayton, Sheridan and Grand Ronde Railroad, a narrow-gauge railway, reached the community.

Sheridan, a timber and farming community southwest of Portland and northwest of Salem, was incorporated in 1880. Sheridan was named for General Philip Sheridan, who was posted to Yamhill County and Fort Yamhill in the latter half of the 1850s to monitor the Native Americans at what is now the Grand Ronde Reservation west of the city. By 1894, Sheridan had grown to 400 residents, one bank, two hotels, three churches, and a flouring mill. At that time there was a daily train to the city as well as daily stage coach service from McMinnville, and a single wooden bridge over the river.

Agriculture was the main industry in Sheridan&#x27;s early years. Around 1910, the main crops included hops, clover-seed, hay, potatoes, onions, and a variety of fruits including apples, prunes, and pears. In March 1910, 150 workers at a lumber yard owned by the Sheridan Lumber Company went on strike for higher wages. The strike was supported by Portland members of the Industrial Workers of the World who picketed employment agencies in Portland to prevent the company from hiring strikebreakers. The action was successful and the workers won a pay increase of twenty-five cents per day, .
On July 18, 1913, a fire that destroyed most of the commercial district caused $300,000 in damage. Most of the buildings were rebuilt with brick within six months. On October 30, 1930, the Jesuits purchased an farm on a hill overlooking the city. There they started St. Francis Xavier&#x27;s Novitiate, a school for training priests for the order. Opening in a new building and several existing farm buildings in 1931, St. Francis Xavier&#x27;s added more buildings over the next several decades.

In 1932, the state built a highway through Sheridan from McMinnville to the Oregon Coast, which became Oregon Route 18 or the Salmon River Highway. With funds received through the Works Progress Administration, the current steel bridge across the South Yamhill River was built and opened in 1939. By 1940, agriculture was still a major industry, and the timber industry was growing in importance to the local economy. At that time the city had grown to a population of 1,008 people.

The state built a bypass around Sheridan and Willamina that opened in 1957 to carry Oregon Route 18 on the south end of the city. The old alignment through the center of town became Oregon Route 18 Business. Sheridan had its largest flooding in history on December 22, 1964. The South Yamhill overflowed its banks and isolated the town for two days. The Jesuits sold their training school in 1974 to the Delphian Foundation, who then opened The Delphian School at the site in 1976.

In 1989, a federal minimum and medium security prison called the Federal Correctional Institution opened on the south side of Sheridan. At that time, Sheridan had a population of around 2,500 people. Sheridan moved its city hall into the old railroad station in January 1993, and expanded the renovated building in 1995. The U.S. Census Bureau erroneously listed Shetidan&#x27;s population as 3,570 in the 2000 Census after mis-listing the prison&#x27;s population in the wrong census tract. This error of about 2000 people was enough to throw off the state legislative districts beyond their margin of acceptance and the Oregon Supreme Court ruled the Secretary of State must re-draw the boundary lines to match the correct data. Sheridan also counts the prison population as part of the city&#x27;s official population. In December 2008, a two-alarm fire gutted the 1875 United Methodist Church in the city.

<text>East Berlin is a borough in Adams County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,542 at the 2020 census.

East Berlin is located in the southern part of Pennsylvania, adjacent to the York County border and west of York.

== History ==
===Pre-colonization and early development===
Prior to the arrival of European settlers, the area in what would become East Berlin was inhabited by the Susquehannock Native Americans. As early as 1734, German, Irish, Dutch, and Quaker settlers began occupying land in what would later become Adams County. Following the 1736 signing of a treaty in Philadelphia between Thomas Penn and members of the Six Nations, many settlers began safely moving to the area.

In 1764, John Frankenberger purchased two hundred acres of land from Thomas and Richard Penn, the sons of William Penn. He divided it into eighty-five lots with streets and alleys and named it &quot;Berlin&quot; after Berlin, Germany, then the capital of the Kingdom of Prussia, his native country. Subsequently, confusion with another community in Pennsylvania led to altering the name to &quot;East Berlin.&quot; By 1797, under the new owner John Hildebrand, East Berlin had approximately one hundred houses. When York County was divided in 1800, East Berlin became part of the newly created Adams County.

===19th Century and the Civil War===
For much of its early history, East Berlin was not legally a borough with its own municipal government, but a part of neighboring Hamilton Township; on November 10, 1879, after town residents petitioned the Court of Adams County, 407 acres of land around the community were officially designated as the borough of East Berlin. The town would maintain basic infrastructure like streets, sidewalks, curbs, and oil lamps. The borough built a water reservoir in 1897. Congressman and abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens briefly owned property in East Berlin from 1832 to 1848 before moving to Lancaster.

During the Gettysburg campaign of the Civil War, Jubal Early&#x27;s Confederate troops marched twice through East Berlin, only a few days before the Battle of Gettysburg would take place. Many residents, aware that the soldiers would pillage and loot for supplies, left milk and other supplies outside their homes, hoping to appease the soldiers. There are other stories of incidents between residents of East Berlin and the Confederate soldiers: after spotting women baking bread in the communal ovens, Confederate soldiers allegedly forced the women to hand over the bread they had made. Other folklore suggests that an unidentified man in the second story of the tavern on King Street shot at the Confederates as they passed through town, and that two families with the name Lincoln from nearby Dover hid in East Berlin after hearing that Confederates would kill anyone they met named &quot;Lincoln.&quot; Early himself spent the night at the Zinn farmhouse (named after the woman who owned it) just west of the town on June 27, where he was treated to a variety of Pennsylvania Dutch dishes.

In 1877, the Berlin Branch Railroad was completed, linking the town to Berlin Junction on the Hanover Junction, Hanover and Gettysburg Railroad. The railroad operated until 1914, when the tracks were removed from East Berlin to Abbottstown. The rail line was relaid in 1916 and continued to operate as the East Berlin Railroad until 1939. The tracks were again removed in 1940.

===20th Century===
In 1921, power lines were constructed in East Berlin, as well as neighboring Abbottstown. 1933 marked the first year that natural gas piping was operational in the town. In the 1950s, the East Berlin Municipal Authority was created, which began to construct a sewage and water treatment facility. Despite some cave-ins during construction of the lines, no major injuries were sustained during its difficult construction, and the project was completed in February 1957.

American diplomat George F. Kennan bought a farm in East Berlin in 1942. Following his work in President Harry S. Truman’s administration, he used it as a secondary home while he worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He owned it until his death in 2005. In 1967, Kennan had his daughter Grace house Svetlana Stalin, the daughter of Joseph Stalin, in their home in East Berlin following her defection to the United States, where she stayed for the summer; Grace admits that the people of East Berlin did not &quot;know they had a mysterious visitor in their midst.&quot;

The East Berlin Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

<text>McSherrystown is a borough in Adams County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,077 as of the 2020 census.

McSherrystown was home to the headquarters of Teddy Bear manufacturer Boyds Bears, as well as the oldest operating family-run cigar manufacturer in the U.S. (since 1863), F.X. Smith &amp; Sons. Boyds has since closed down, and in 2018, the cigar company was sold.

McSherrystown is the fourth oldest town in Adams County. Its founder, Patrick McSherry (1725–1795), who had family origins stemming from Newry in the south-east of Ulster in the north of Ireland, procured a tract from the Digges Family in 1763 and proceeded to lay out a number of lots. The first known deed for one of these lots was dated June 27, 1765. Although McSherry may have intended his effort to be used primarily as outlots for Hanover residents, where they could keep their animals at times and obtain wood, it soon developed into a full-fledged town. McSherry, who lived in Mount Pleasant Township in 1765 and was later tavern-keeper in Littlestown, may never have lived in the town which bears his name.

==History==
Orrtanna was established in 1885 around Orr Station, a stop on the Baltimore and Harrisburg Railway. It originally was known as Wortzville after George Wortz, a local businessman, but was changed to Orr Station and then Orr Glen. The establishment of the post office in 1892 lead to the realization that Orr Glen was already a registered town name in Pennsylvania, so the name finally became Orrtanna in 1892, for Isaiah Orr, a large property owner in the area, and a nearby tannery.

A number of businesses have existed in Orrtanna. The Orrtanna Canning Company was founded in 1913 by John S. Musselman and Ivan Z. Musselman. Notably, in October 1919, approximately 30 women apple peelers walked out of the factory as part of a general movement for greater wages in canning factories in Gardners and Biglerville. In 1949, the Orrtanna Canning Company was sold to Knouse Foods Cooperative. The Adams County Winery opened in 1975, making it the fifth oldest operating winery in Pennsylvania and Hickory Bridge Farm opened in 1977 as a bed and breakfast.

<text>Straban Township is a township in Adams County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 4,928 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Straban Township is located in central Adams County, adjacent to the eastern border of Gettysburg. A portion of the Gettysburg National Military Park is within the township. According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.46%, is water.

==History==

===Founding===
Straban Township was created in 1746 when the area was still part of Lancaster County. Named for Strabane, a town in Northern Ireland, this spelling was in use as late as the 1870s. For the most part, the original boundaries remain unchanged to this day. York County was formed out of Lancaster County in 1749, and for the next 51 years, Straban Township was a part of York County, until Adams County was formed in 1800.

The Hunterstown Historic District, Great Conewago Presbyterian Church and Wirts House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Casino proposal===
During 2006 there was debate about the proposed construction of a casino in Straban Township near the intersection of U.S. Route 15 and U.S. Route 30, not far from the East Cavalry Field battle site. Legislation enacted in 2005 known as &quot;Act 71&quot; permitted up to 60,000 slot machines to be located in casinos throughout the state in an effort to offset high property taxes. One of two available casino licenses was pursued by Chance Enterprises Inc. and Millennium Management Group for their proposed &quot;Crossroads Gaming Resort &amp; Spa&quot;. Many of the residents of neighboring Gettysburg and tourists believed that a casino near Gettysburg and the resulting increase in traffic would have had a negative impact on Gettysburg&#x27;s hallowed ground. A group called &quot;No Casino Gettysburg&quot;, made up of local citizens as well as students and faculty of Gettysburg College, was formed to lobby against the proposal. On April 3, 2006, the Gettysburg borough council voted by 6–3 to support the proposal.

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) began hearings on the proposal on April 5, 2006, at Gettysburg College. A second hearing was held on April 7, 2006, in Harrisburg, and a third and final hearing occurred on May 17, 2006, at Gettysburg College. On December 20, 2006, the PGCB opted not to award Crossroads a casino license, effectively killing the proposal. Crossroads&#x27; president soon announced that he would not appeal the decision. In February 2007, the activist group, No Casino Gettysburg, disbanded.

==Environmental issues==
Keystone Sanitation Landfill is located on a ridge of 40 acres of former farmland. From 1966 until 1990, it accepted municipal and industrial waste and construction debris. The site leached volatile organic compounds and heavy metals, and runoff went in all directions into the groundwater and surface water, affecting 2,300 people living in a three-mile radius. EPA added the landfill to the Superfund list in July 1987. From 1990-1997, cleanup consisted of extraction and treatment of on-site groundwater, installation of an impermeable cap, a landfill gas collection system, construction of a fence, and water monitoring. In 1999, 34 residences in proximity received whole-house treatment units, and groundwater was also extracted off-site. In May 2003, a landfill gas extraction system was added. However, due to low flow rates, 14 additional landfill gas wells were installed in November 2010.

In September 1993, EPA tried to recover approximately $1.4 million of clean up costs in litigation, which as of 2015 was still stayed, pending court-ordered settlement negotiations. The three owners of the landfill, Waste Management Inc., the Keystone Sanitation Company, and Anna and Kenneth Noel, refused to participate in cleanup and in 2000, the EPA fined them $250,000.

<text>York Springs is a borough in Adams County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 683 at the 2020 census. York Springs is served by the Bermudian Springs School District.

==History==
York Springs was platted as Petersburg within Latimore Township. York Sulphur Springs, the first summer resort in Adams County, was patronized by people from Philadelphia and Baltimore who came to the resort by stage coach. General George Washington and his wife Martha visited the area in the summer of 1799. The water was regarded as medicinal but unpalatable. Analysis claimed 20 parts Epsom salts, 6 parts gypsum, 4 parts common salt, and the balance sulfur. The hotel was destroyed by fire on January 8, 1896. The Springs&#x27; popularity decreased with the construction of the railroad and the resort buildings disappeared.

York Springs&#x27; previous names were York Sulphur Springs and Petersburg. To completely end confusion with Littlestown, when Petersburg became a borough in 1868 it was named York Sulphur Springs, later shortened to York Springs.

<text>Aspinwall is a borough on the Allegheny River in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The population was 2,916 at the 2020 census.

==History==

In the mid-1880s, the area which is now Aspinwall was primarily owned by the descendants of James Ross, but as the steel industry was thriving in Pittsburgh, Henry Warner, superintendent of the Allegheny County Workhouse, had the idea of creating a residential community along the bank of a river.

Warner traveled to New York to discuss the idea with Annie Aspinwall. He purchased of land from her and formed the Aspinwall Land Company in 1890. Pittsburghers, mostly from the upper-middle class, purchased lots from the 60 available home sites. By 1890, the town had 400 residents, most of whom were young couples with children. The existing government of O&#x27;Hara Township was having difficulty providing services to the rapidly growing area and, in 1892, 40 residents of the new community signed a petition requesting incorporation as &quot;The Borough of Aspinwall, a self-governing unit.&quot;

Aspinwall was officially incorporated as a borough on December 28, 1892, from O&#x27;Hara Township.

Aspinwall was served by Pittsburgh Railways streetcar service &quot;94 Aspinwall&quot; from c.1910 until November 12, 1960, when the service was discontinued on the closure of the 62nd Street Sharpsburg Bridge. This was replaced by the Senator Robert D. Fleming Bridge which did not have streetcar tracks.

From 1893 to 1905, Aspinwall developed in three phases, beginning with the area closest to the Allegheny River. On September 25, 1905, a group of Aspinwall residents purchased from the Delafield Plan and annexed this additional land to the borough.

Early recreational facilities in the borough included tennis courts and water fountains. During World War I, the Patriots Committee of Aspinwall purchased wristwatches from a watch factory in Canton, Ohio, which they presented to the approximately 164 Aspinwall men entering the service. Aspinwall held their own victory parade and memorial service for the soldiers of their borough.

<text>Avalon is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Ohio River downstream from Pittsburgh. The population was 4,762 at the 2020 census. It is a residential suburb of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
On December 9, 1874, a group of 29 property owners met and decided they wanted to separate from Kilbuck Township, which itself split from Pine Township in 1869. They petitioned the Court of Quarter Sessions of Pennsylvania for incorporation papers. The petition was drawn up by Noah Shafer, who eventually became West Bellevue&#x27;s first solicitor. The group was notified that it first had to hold an election so officials of the petitioning body could make the request for incorporation. The first election was held December 26, 1874. James Semple was elected the first burgess, a position he held three different times. When the petition was submitted the second time, the court was in recess. The court met again in April, and on April 7, 1875, approved the petition and West Bellevue&#x27;s right to incorporation. It was named after the legendary island of Avalon (&quot;land of apples&quot;) on account of there being several orchards in the area. The streetcar reached Avalon around 1900, and in later years the borough was served by Pittsburgh Railways route &quot;14 Avalon&quot; and then route &quot;6/14 Brighton Avalon&quot;. The service ended on April 30, 1966, when many of the West End lines were abandoned by the Port Authority of Allegheny County, in preparation for bridge replacements over the Allegheny River.

<text>Baldwin Township is a township in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,984 at the 2020 census, a decrease from the figure of 1,992 tabulated in 2010.

==Geography==

==Surrounding communities==
Baldwin Township has four borders, including the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Brookline to the north and Overbrook to the northeast and southeast. The other two borders are with Castle Shannon to the south and southwest and Mt. Lebanon to the west.

==History==
The area that would become Baldwin Township was originally settled around 1780. The Allegheny County Court of Quarter Sessions established Baldwin Township on February 24, 1844, from Upper St. Clair, Lower St. Clair, Jefferson, and Mifflin townships. The area was named for Henry Baldwin, a Pittsburgh lawyer who served as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court from 1830 until his death in 1844.

Baldwin Township was originally and consisted of the present-day Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Carrick, Hays, Brookline, and Overbrook, along with the present-day municipalities of Brentwood, Whitehall, Castle Shannon, and Baldwin Borough.

The coal seam lying underneath Baldwin Township made mining the township&#x27;s largest industry. The township was also home to the first glass factories in Allegheny County. Agriculture was an important part of Baldwin Township&#x27;s economy from 1753 to 1876. Its most well-known agricultural exports were cherries and whiskey (many citizens of Baldwin Township were part of the Whiskey Rebellion).

The township continued to thrive until the late 19th century. Due to the lack of maintenance throughout the township&#x27;s roads, residents of many areas broke off to form their own municipalities. In 1901, became the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Hays. Three years later in 1904, Carrick and Brookline became Pittsburgh wards, taking with them and , respectively. From 1915 to 1951, approximately of the original Baldwin Township broke off to become the municipalities of Brentwood, Castle Shannon, Mt. Lebanon, Whitehall, and Baldwin Borough. The City of Pittsburgh annexed an additional area of land that is now the city&#x27;s Overbrook neighborhood.

Today, only 400 of the township&#x27;s original remain. Historians calculate that if Baldwin Township had never been divided, it would now be the second largest community in Allegheny County, with a population of over 100,000.

<text>Bellevue is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 8,311 at the 2020 census. A suburb of Pittsburgh, it is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

The borough was incorporated in 1867. There is a public park and library, the Andrew Bayne Memorial Library.

==History==
The land on which the borough currently sits was once part of the Depreciation Lands reserved for Revolutionary War veterans. The first landowners in the area were James Robinson and Hugh Henry Brackenridge, purchasing parcels in 1799 and 1792 respectively. At the time of its organization as a borough, Bellevue had exactly the minimum population for such a designation: 300 residents.

Residents of the area tried unsuccessfully to obtain improvements from Ross Township, but officials were opposed to development along Venango Trail (today Route 19). In response, Bellevue was incorporated as a borough independent of Ross on September 7, 1867. The name of the borough was chosen by J. J. East, a linguist and early resident of the borough, and means &quot;beautiful view.&quot;

Bellevue was always a &quot;dry&quot; town, even before Prohibition, meaning that the sale of alcohol in stores or restaurants was restricted. Sale of alcohol is currently regulated by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB). The borough&#x27;s 2011 primary election included a referendum to permit limited alcohol sales at certain establishments; the proposal was defeated. A similar proposal in 2015 passed.

===Architecture===
Bellevue contains over 1,000 buildings over 100 years old. In 2016, to recognize 150 years since the borough&#x27;s founding, Bellevue&#x27;s Community Development Corporation (CDC), &quot;Bona Fide Bellevue&quot;, launched a historic building plaque program, consisting of inventorying all the buildings in Bellevue. Of over 2,600 buildings, just over 730 had been approved locally &quot;historic.&quot; Over 150 property owners voluntarily elected to purchase a plaque signifying the historic nature of their buildings.

Three buildings have been further recognized as historic:

*Andrew Bayne House - 34 North Balph Avenue - built 1875. Andrew Bayne Public Library. Recognized by Pittsburgh History Landmarks Foundation (PHLF).
*Andrew S. and Elizabeth Miller House - 366 Lincoln Avenue - built 1902. Currently a restaurant. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2019 and recognized by PHLF.
*Marius Rousseau House - 100 Watkins Avenue - built 1906. Private residence. Recognized by PHLF.

<text>Ben Avon is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 1,918 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

The name, Ben Avon, comes from Scottish for &quot;hill by the waters&quot;.

==History==
Ben Avon was incorporated as a borough in January 1891, from Kilbuck Township.

Like many early suburbs, Ben Avon was originally linked to Pittsburgh by train. One of the first homes in the area, the Arthur-Johnson House, was built at a bend in the Ohio River above the Pittsburgh and Fort Wayne Railroad, a route that was known to George Washington. The house was built by a merchant from Allegheny City looking for a summer retreat from the steel industry. To make the commute from Pittsburgh easier, a commuter railroad was built. Laurel Run station was located by the Arthur-Johnson House. The new railroad made Ben Avon and bordering Avalon a desirable place for wealthy merchants and executives to live. Ben Avon had its own newspaper, the &quot;Ben Avon Forum&quot;, which, in July 1930, wrote, &quot;Ben Avon is the most desirable community to live in the entire Allegheny County - and if pressed, we might take an even larger territory.&quot;

In 1928, plans were underway to build the Pittsburgh and Ohio River Boulevard (currently Ohio River Boulevard, along the northern bank of the Ohio River from Pittsburgh to the mouth of the Beaver River at Rochester, Pennsylvania). Residents feared that the new road would change their community. The wide, heavily traveled boulevard divided the community and made it difficult for pedestrians to get from one side of Ben Avon to the other. Additionally, by 1950, the train station at Laurel Run was closed.

Today, Ohio River Boulevard, outside of Ben Avon proper (there are no commercial properties along the boulevard in Ben Avon), is lined with commercial businesses, gas stations, thrift shops, and auto repair shops, but the houses and old railroad tracks from the early 20th century remain as reminders of the era when Ben Avon was a pleasant summer retreat from Pittsburgh&#x27;s steel industry.

==Geography==
Ben Avon is located at (40.507418, -80.082162).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and (14.89%) is water.

Its average elevation is above sea level.

<text>Ben Avon Heights is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, located on a hill above the Ohio River from the city of Pittsburgh. The population was 400 at the 2020 census. Ben Avon Heights is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
Prior to 1906, the land that became Ben Avon Heights was farmland belonging to Samuel Taylor and John Wilson. In 1910, Walter Pringle Fraser of Ben Avon bought on the former Taylor farm, using forty of the acres to build the Ben Avon Country Club and golf course. The remaining were opened for a residential development, which he named Ben Avon Heights. Like neighboring Ben Avon, Ben Avon Heights appealed to Pittsburghers looking for rural summer homes away from the city. The borough was incorporated in 1913.

When the Ben Avon Country Club closed in 1917, it was divided into lots for additional housing. The Shannopin Country Club, the only commercial property in Ben Avon Heights, opened in 1920 with its clubhouse in Ben Avon Heights and golf course in neighboring Kilbuck Township. In the early 1930s, John I. Thompson purchased a portion of the original John Wilson Farm in Kilbuck Township and transformed the farmland into another residential area known as the Thompson Plan. The borough annexed the Thompson Plan in 1936, setting the boundaries of Ben Avon Heights to those of the present day.

The borough now contains 148 homes, a community park, and the club house of the Shannopin Country Club.

<doc id="131079" wikidata="Q1132876" url="?curid=131079" title="Bethel Park, Pennsylvania">
<text>Bethel Park (officially the Municipality of Bethel Park) is a borough with home rule status in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is a suburb within the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, located approximately south of Pittsburgh. The population was 33,577 as of the 2020 census.

== History ==
The area that is now Bethel Park was originally settled around 1800 and was established as Bethel Township in 1886. It was named after Bethel Presbyterian Church, which in turn was named after the ancient Israelite sanctuary of Bethel. Bethel Park was incorporated as a borough on 17 March 1949.

The first armored car robbery in the U.S. occurred in Bethel Park on 11 March 1927, when a Brinks truck was attacked while heading towards the Coverdale Mine about a mile away. Paul Jaworski and the Flathead gang destroyed the road with dynamite to steal a mining payroll.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of , all land. Its average elevation is above sea level. Bethel Park lies at the margin between the Pittsburgh Low Plateau and Waynesburg Hills Sections of the Allegheny Plateau physiographic province. The area is characterized as a maturely dissected region where the ephemeral minor tributaries converge into the tributaries of principal streams.

The highest point in Bethel Park is Rocky Ridge, in the southwestern portion of the borough, , and the lowest point is at the intersection of the Piney Fork and Alsip Run creeks, , in the southeast corner.

===Surrounding towns===
Bethel Park has seven borders, including Castle Shannon to the north, Whitehall to the north-northeast, Baldwin to the northeast, South Park to the east and southeast, Peters Township in Washington County to the south, Upper St. Clair to the west, and Mt. Lebanon to the north-northwest.

===Geology===
The exposed rocks in Bethel Park are mostly composed of sandstone, limestone, shale, and a few coal layers (Redstone, Waynesburg, Washington, etc.). The ages of the exposed rocks bracket the late Pennsylvanian epoch (Gzhelian age; approximately 303 million years ago) near the lowest elevations, and Early Permian period (Asselian age; approximately 297 million years ago) near the highest parts of the southern part of Bethel Park (e.g. Rocky Ridge). These sedimentary rocks were deposited as the sea level rose and fell along an ancient coastline (with the region alternating between delta, shallow lake, and shallow sea), and finally being uplifted with the formation of the Appalachian Mountains.

Bethel Park is underlain by the Pennsylvania-age Monongahela Formation. The Monongahela Formation consists of the Uniontown member and the underlying Pittsburgh member, and the base is the Pittsburgh coal seam. Much of southern Allegheny County is undermined, and the PADEP indicates that all of Bethel Park was undermined.

A portion of the area is underlain by the Pittsburgh Terminal No. 8 Mine (Cortis and others, 1975), which was commonly known as the &quot;H&quot; Mine and the Coverdale Mine. The mine opened around 1920. The historic operations of the Coverdale Mine are apparent on a Bridgeville 7.5-minute topographic map. A &quot;Mine Dump&quot; is shown adjacent to the Montour Railroad tracks and South Park Road. Coal was mined through vertical shafts accessing inclined slopes following the dip of the Pittsburgh coal seam. Mine voids in the inclined slope resulted from the practice of room and pillar mining during the early 20th century. The Coverdale Mine is closed and largely unflooded.

==Demographics==

At the 2020 census there were 33,556 people, 13,362 households, and 9,540 families living in the Municipality. The population density was . There were 13,871 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the borough was 97.10% White, 1.02% African American, 0.03% Native American, 1.11% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.13% from other races, and 0.58% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.49%.

There were 13,362 households, 30.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 62.0% were married couples living together, 7.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.6% were non-families. 26.1% of households were made up of individuals, and 12.0% were one person aged 65 or older. The average household size was 2.48 and the average family size was 3.01.

The age distribution was 23.7% under the age of 18, 5.0% from 18 to 24, 26.8% from 25 to 44, 26.5% from 45 to 64, and 18.1% 65 or older. The median age was 42 years. For every 100 females there were 91.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.7 males.

The median household income was $53,791 and the median family income was $64,390. Males had a median income of $47,876 versus $32,351 for females. The per capita income for the borough was $25,867.

==Arts and culture==
;Points of interest:
*Bethel Presbyterian Church
*South Hills Village

==Government==
The Municipality&#x27;s home rule status provides Bethel Park with greater powers of governance than the default form of borough government. It is divided into nine wards of approximately equal population, each electing one member of the Bethel Park Municipal Council, and all together electing the mayor at large. Both the mayor and the council member serve four-year terms. Each council member is required to reside in the ward that they represent.

==Politics==
Eliza Griswold of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described the municipality as &quot;a politically and economically mixed community&quot; with varying sizes and amenities in the housing.

==Education==

The school district is Bethel Park School District. The district&#x27;s comprehensive high school is Bethel Park High School.

== Transportation ==

The completion of the Pittsburgh Railways Interurbans in the early 1900s opened up Bethel Park to accelerated growth and development, making the area an early example of a streetcar suburb. While most of the Pittsburgh area&#x27;s passenger rail and streetcar services were discontinued in the 1950s and 1960s and further growth was fueled by automobiles, the trolley lines through Bethel Park were kept in service and upgraded to modern light rail standards in the 1980s. All three of Port Authority of Allegheny County&#x27;s light rail lines run through Bethel Park, with the Blue and Red lines terminating at South Hills Village, and the Silver Line passing through the central business district to its terminus in Library. Park-and-ride lots at South Hills Village, West Library, Lytle, and Washington Junction provide local commuters with an easy trip to Pittsburgh.

Pennsylvania Route 88 and U.S. Route 19 run through Bethel Park, with much of the area&#x27;s busy commercial developments along the two corridors. The Yellow and Orange Belts of the Allegheny County belt system serve the borough, with the Orange Belt terminating in the southeast corner near the border with South Park. Interstate 79 and the Mon-Fayette Expressway do not enter Bethel Park but are both within a 15-minute drive from the borough. The cancelled South Hills Expressway was planned to be constructed along the Route 88 corridor.

In addition to light rail service, Port Authority&#x27;s 36 Banksville and Mid Mon Valley Transit Authority&#x27;s Commuter A routes provide bus service through the commercial areas of the borough.

<text>Braddock is a borough located in the eastern suburbs of Pittsburgh in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, upstream from the mouth of the Monongahela River. The population was 1,721 as of the 2020 census, a 91.8% decline since its peak of 20,879 in 1920.

==History==

Braddock is named for General Edward Braddock (1695–1755), commander of American colonial forces at the start of the French and Indian War. The Braddock Expedition to capture Fort Duquesne (modern day Pittsburgh) from the French led to the British general&#x27;s own fatal wounding and a sound defeat of his troops after crossing the Monongahela River on July 9, 1755. This battle, now called the Battle of the Monongahela, was a key event at the beginning of the French and Indian War.

The area surrounding Braddock&#x27;s Field was originally inhabited by the Lenape, ruled by Queen Alliquippa.

In 1742, John Fraser and his family established the area at the mouth of Turtle Creek as the first permanent English settlement west of the Allegheny Mountains. George Washington visited the area in 1753–1754. It was the site of Braddock&#x27;s Defeat on July 9, 1755.

Braddock&#x27;s first industrial facility, a barrel plant, opened in 1850. The borough was incorporated on June 8, 1867. The town&#x27;s industrial economy began in 1873, when Andrew Carnegie built the Edgar Thomson Steel Works on the historic site of Braddock&#x27;s Field in what is now North Braddock, Pennsylvania. This was one of the first American steel mills which used the Bessemer process. As of 2010, it continues operation as a part of the United States Steel Corporation. This era of the town&#x27;s history is depicted in Thomas Bell&#x27;s novel &quot;Out of This Furnace&quot;.

Braddock is also the location of the first of Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s 1,679 (some sources list 1,689) public libraries in the US, designed by William Halsey Wood of Newark, New Jersey, and dedicated on March 30, 1889. The Braddock Library included a tunnel entrance for Carnegie&#x27;s millworkers to enter a bathhouse in the basement to clean up before entering the facilities (which originally included billiard tables). An addition in 1893, by Longfellow, Alden and Harlow (Boston &amp; Pittsburgh, successors to Henry Hobson Richardson), added a swimming pool, indoor basketball court, and 964-seat music hall that included a Votey pipe organ. The building was rescued from demolition in 1978 by the Braddock&#x27;s Field Historical Society, and is still in use as a public library. The bathhouse has recently been converted to a pottery studio; the music hall is currently under restoration.

During the early 1900s many immigrants settled in Braddock, primarily from Croatia, Slovenia, and Hungary.
Braddock lost its importance with the collapse of the steel industry in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. This coincided with the crack cocaine epidemic of the early 1980s, and the combination of the two woes nearly destroyed the community. In 1988, Braddock was designated a financially distressed municipality. The entire water distribution system was rebuilt in 1990-1991 at a cost of $4.7 million, resulting in a fine system where only 5% of piped water is deemed &quot;unaccounted-for&quot;. As of the early 2020s, Braddock&#x27;s population is approximately 90% reduced from a peak of about 20,000 in the 1920s.

John Fetterman, mayor of Braddock from 2006 until his 2019 inauguration as Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania, launched a campaign to attract new residents to the area from the artistic and creative communities. He also initiated various revitalization efforts, including the nonprofit organization Braddock Redux. In the 2022 midterms, Fetterman became the first US Senator from Pennsylvania to hail from Braddock, and the second member of Congress, after Matthew A. Dunn.

Since 1974, Braddock resident Tony Buba has made many films. One of his earlier films is &quot;Justice League&quot; centering on the borough and its industrial decline, including &quot;Struggles in Steel.&quot; In September 2010, the IFC and Sundance television channels showed the film &quot;Ready to Work: Portraits of Braddock&quot;, produced by the Levi Strauss corporation. This film interviews many of the local residents and shows their efforts to revitalize the town.

<text>Braddock Hills is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,730 at the 2020 census. Braddock Hills is located approximately east of downtown Pittsburgh and is a residential suburb of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
Braddock Hills is located northwest of Braddock&#x27;s Field, the site of General Edward Braddock&#x27;s 1755 defeat during the French and Indian War. The main road which winds through the borough, Brinton Road, was originally an Indian trail, used by the area&#x27;s indigenous people to keep watch for their enemies. The other main road in the borough, Braddock Road, was the main link between Braddock Hills and Braddock used by farmers and coal miners. The first area of the borough to be settled was along Brinton Road, first settled as Hannatown.

First settled in 1753, the area was part of Wilkins Township until 1885, when Braddock Township was incorporated. On May 2, 1946, after Braddock Township had already been broken up into the boroughs of Swissvale, North Braddock, and Rankin, the remaining area incorporated itself as Braddock Hills.

Braddock Hills experienced a housing boom following World War II. Many GIs used their VA loans to acquire newly built homes. Most of the new homes were built on Illinois Ave, Park Ave, Columbia Ave, Circle Drive, McKelvey Ave, and Kings Road. These homes were generally small brick Cape Cods, colonials, or brick ranches. While much of the borough has new housing, there are many older structures. Miners built shotgun-style homes. Many of these homes were located on Indiana Avenue. Some are still in use.

Many older residents can recall when the Braddock Hills Shopping Center on Yost Boulevard was the location of a drive-in movie theater. The Ardmore Drive-In operated from 1959 to 1976; it was then torn down and was replaced with a shopping center. During the 1980s the shopping center&#x27;s parking lot hosted a Sunday flea market and the Braddock Hills Days Festival. 

Like many Western Pennsylvania communities, Braddock Hills was a coal town. There are many abandoned coal mines located throughout the town. This has resulted in sinkholes in an area that has been called the &quot;coal fields&quot;. The coal fields are located in the center of the community.

Another prominent historical feature of the borough is the Braddock Catholic Cemetery. It served as the burying ground for many mill workers in the surrounding communities.

Braddock Hills was the home of Leonard A. Funk, a Medal of Honor recipient. A monument dedicated to his exemplary service is located on Brinton Road in front of the senior citizens&#x27; building. It was also home to prominent residents, Kingsley and Velma Carey. Kingsley Carey was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II. In 2012, he was honored by the Veterans Leadership Program of Western Pennsylvania at Carnegie Hall. Velma Carey, wife of Kingsley Carey, was a popular jazz singer in Pittsburgh in the 1940s and 1950s. Velma Carey is believed to have been the first African American woman to appear on Pittsburgh television. She made an appearance on &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot; television program.

Brinton Road is the longest street in this community.

Braddock Hills Elementary closed its doors in 1978. It would soon be converted into a community center that would house the police department and a daycare center. In 1981, the Swissvale Area School District combined, after court ordered desegregation, even further to form the Woodland Hills School District that serves Braddock Hills today.

The public high school for the borough is Woodland Hills High School. The Community College of Allegheny County&#x27;s Braddock Hills Center is also located in the borough.

<text>Brentwood is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 10,082 at the 2020 census. It is a residential suburb of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
Brentwood, located approximately from downtown Pittsburgh and is 101 years old, was once an integral part of Baldwin Township, which included the villages of Brentwood, Point View, and Whitehall.

In 1914, a group of citizens in the village of Brentwood took a set of grievances to the Baldwin Township Board of Commissioners, regarding the lack of sidewalks, sewers, fire protection, police, and a school house. Upon further disregard of these necessities from the township, a group of men from the village held a meeting on January 27, 1915, to discuss secession. After considerable discussion, the boundary lines of Brentwood were finalized by the Board of Trade. Building a sidewalk along Brownsville Road was the first official action taken by the Board of Trade. On November 6, 1915, the Quarter Sessions Court of Allegheny County decreed that Brentwood was officially seceded from Baldwin Township. The proceedings to incorporate were filed on May 15, 1916, creating the Borough of Brentwood.

On December 4, 1915, special elections were held to elect a burgess, auditors, justices of the peace, high constable, tax collector, assessor, and councilmen. Brentwood&#x27;s first burgess was Bernard Kestner, sworn in on December 9, 1915. He served Brentwood for sixteen years. The board met monthly and continued to discuss necessary steps for the structure of the borough.

On Labor Day, 1928, the borough celebrated the official opening of the park, pool, and paving of Brownsville Road.

A former councilman of Brentwood, Bob Cranmer, served as an Allegheny County commissioner, 1996–2000. He was involved with a number of historic government initiatives and large civic development projects, being both local and regional in scope.

A Hall of Fame NFL linebacker, Joe Schmidt played for Brentwood High School.

==Geography and climate==
Brentwood is located at (40.374469, -79.976179).
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

The borough is in the Allegheny Plateau region of the United States, and is situated south of the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River to form the Ohio River.

Due to its position between the Great Lakes and the windward side of the Allegheny Mountains, Brentwood, along with the rest of the region, receives plentiful precipitation which supports lush vegetation. Also, because it is on the windward side of the mountains, it is often cloudy, having 203 cloudy days per year. The winter is particularly cloudy, with only 28 percent sunshine in December and 23 cloudy days. In the winter, when a northwest flow establishes itself over the Great Lakes, the wind blows from Lake Erie across eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. That wind carries moist air from the lake, producing clouds and heavy snow squalls.

===Surrounding communities===
Brentwood has three borders, including Baldwin to the east and northeast, Whitehall to the south and west, and the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Carrick to the northwest.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 10,466 people, 4,658 households, 2,762 families, residing in the borough. The population density was . There were 4,895 housing units at an average density of .

The average household size was 2.24 and the average family size was 2.95.

In the borough the population was spread out, with 21.2% under the age of 18, 7.8% from 18 to 24, 31.7% from 25 to 44, 21.4% from 45 to 64, and 17.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 90.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.6 males.

The median income for a household in the borough was $37,013, and the median income for a family was $48,552. Males had a median income of $36,097 versus $29,526 for females. The per capita income for the borough was $20,024. About 4.8% of families and 6.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.0% of those under age 18 and 6.2% of those age 65 or over.


==Economy==
Brentwood has a neighborhood main street (Brownsville Road) with businesses that stretch from the southern border of the Pittsburgh area to the northern border of Whitehall Borough. More recently, Brentwood Towne Square was built along Brownsville Road and Route 51. Many shops, restaurants, and offices are in the square.

==Arts and culture==
Brownsville Road follows the route of a pre-Columbian era Native American Indian trail and footpaths connecting Redstone Old Fort with the &quot;forks of the Ohio&quot;, a distance of . It later became the road connecting Pittsburgh with Brownsville, Pennsylvania, and from there via Nemacolin&#x27;s Path to Virginia and points further east. It was a major route for travel by stagecoach and Conestoga wagon. The road was significant during the Whiskey Rebellion, particularly its southern half. It has had several names over its history, including the Red Stone Road and the Brownsville Plank Road, or Southern Avenue.

The Point View Hotel dates back to 1832. General Andrew Jackson spent a night there before he entered Pittsburgh while campaigning for the presidency. General Zachary Taylor stopped for a night as well. President James Buchanan and Senator Thaddeus Stevens stayed on two occasions. Not only did the hotel have many guests who were quite important people, but the basement of the hotel was a stop on the Underground Railroad during the 1850s. The hotel was then turned into a restaurant and bar until the property was sold and demolished in November 2006, as it was never officially recognized as a historic landmark. A medical office building has been built on this site.

The John F. Slater Funeral Home, formerly the White Hall Tavern, was another important place in Brentwood&#x27;s history. In the earlier days of Brentwood&#x27;s time, many city dwellers rode stagecoaches on Brownsville Road, because this was the only major roadway connecting the cities of Pittsburgh and Brownsville. The White Hall Tavern was just a short walk to the race track which was once on the site of the South Hills Country Club, which is why many people from the city stopped here for relaxation.

The Windsor Hotel was opened in 1882. Although there was a fire sixteen years later, it was rebuilt and remained a popular place for vacationers.

The Davis Farm House was another historical place in Brentwood&#x27;s history, although it was gained by the borough in 1968. The house and grounds became a senior citizens’ recreation center. Much debate was encountered when it was considered being torn down to build a new firehouse and recreation room. Although the house had been considered a historical site by much of the town, it was eventually torn down, and the new fire house was built in place of the senior citizens’ center.

The Cowan Farm House at 4111 Brownsville Road, is an example of the early architecture of Brentwood. The estate and farm comprised the property is located at 4111 Brownsville Road and much of the surrounding area. The early Cowan family was a major landowner in Brentwood.

=== Brentwood Arboretum ===
The arboretum was founded in 1997 by members of the community. It is located on the grounds of the Brentwood School District, the Brentwood Library, and the Brentwood Park, and the land is owned by each respective body. The collection of trees comprises extant and new specimens planted by the community, library, and school district. Community members hope to extend the collection during the renovations at the park.

The collection includes:
*Ginkgo &quot;(Ginkgo Biloba):&quot; Three specimen trees directly in front of the middle-high school
*Japanese Larch &quot;(Larix kaempferi):&quot; Two specimens at the northern entrance to the middle-high school adjacent to the library

===Library===
Brentwood&#x27;s public library is located at the center of the borough on Brownsville Road, at the entrance of Brentwood Park. A person can borrow books, movies, puppets, puzzles, magazines, and CDs. There is a children&#x27;s area, and there are many computers for public access to the internet. The library hosts many children&#x27;s events throughout the year including story times and visitations by authors. For adults the library hosts educational classes, informational meetings and book clubs.

The library was founded in 1947 as a project of the Moore School P.T.A. Originally the library was in the basement of the Moore School. The library then moved to the Brentwood Borough building in the area currently occupied by the Brentwood EMS. On July 4, 1990, the library moved to the existing facility which was newly built with a main reading room, meeting rooms, and community room.

==Parks and recreation==
The Brentwood High School Spartans play football, soccer, baseball, and softball, in the local park. Brentwood Borough opened the park and pool on July 4, 1928, but it was not until 1948 that the football stadium, track, four baseball fields, tennis courts, and basketball courts were built.

In 2013, the Brentwood Park underwent roughly $8 million (~$ in ) in comprehensive improvements. The project was spearheaded by the Brentwood Park Initiative, the independent committee helping to raise funds and community awareness. The renovations included new turf to replace the grass field at Brentwood Stadium; a quarter-mile rubber track; an in-line dek hockey rink; new basketball and tennis courts; and energy-efficient lighting.

==Government and politics==
==Education==
Brentwood is served by the Brentwood Borough School District.

The Court of Common Pleas appointed Brentwood&#x27;s first school board who took charge of school business in July 1916, and the first group of teachers were hired that same year in September. Brentwood&#x27;s first school was Moore Elementary School, then only a four-room school house, which is still in use by children and teachers. Because Moore School was not sufficient in size for all the students in the borough, Elroy School was built about three-quarters of a mile away toward Pittsburgh, and renovations were completed in 1925 to both schools.

The first Brentwood High School opened in the basement of Elroy School in September 1925 and only taught through ninth grade. The high school was newly built in 1932 adjacent to the current Brentwood Park; an addition was constructed in 1939 because of the increase in population, and once again in 1959. This renovation included more rooms and a new gymnasium.

In the late 1960s, Pennsylvania experienced a consolidation of school districts. Some wanted the Brentwood school district to be folded into the Baldwin-Whitehall district. However, this consolidation was never realized, and in 1972 a new four-story building containing classrooms and an indoor pool was constructed.

In the early 1990s the consensus on the school board was to close Moore and Elroy schools and consolidate them into an expanded K-12th grade facility at the existing high school. An intense community debate on whether to close Moore and Elroy schools ensued with the supporters of preserving and rehabilitating Moore and Elroy prevailing. In 1997, the board of directors fully modernized and remodeled Elroy School and Moore School received two new additional classrooms. The district also built a new academic wing to the front of the 1939 building, and a second gymnasium was placed on the demolished third and fourth floors of the 1972 addition.

St. Sylvester School was established in September 1948 as a large church, lunch room, and a small four-classroom Catholic elementary school. St. Sylvester served as Brentwood&#x27;s parochial elementary school, teaching children from preschool to 8th grade. The Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh closed the school in 2019.

==Public safety==
The fire department was organized on December 8, 1915. In 1916, the police department, which was formed only of two men, was developed. In 1977, the EMS was founded.

<text>Bridgeville is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 4,804 at the 2020 census. It is a residential suburb of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
The village that eventually became Bridgeville acquired its name because of the first bridge built at the crossing of Chartiers Creek at the south end of what is now Washington Avenue.

The area was originally named St. Clair Township in 1763, and the southern part was split off as Upper St. Clair Township in 1806. For nearly 100 years, Bridgeville was a village within Upper St. Clair Township, known for its one bridge over Chartiers Creek where people frequently met to trade goods. An old saying, &quot;Meet me at the bridge,&quot; provided an obvious name for the village that began to develop north of the bridge around 1830.

Mining operations began in the 1880s, prompting growth. One impressive institution for the time was The Norwood Hotel. Of Victorian architecture, it included about forty eight rooms for occupants, a dining room, a bar, and a ball room. Each room had a fireplace, and the entire hotel was provided with running water. A two inch pipeline led from Brandy Spring, high on the hill above Chartiers Creek at the end of Elizabeth Street, to the hotel. The spring was touted as a mineral spring, with the associated therapeutic properties claimed for its water. The Norwood’s grounds were extensive. There was a covered outdoor bowling alley, well groomed lawns, an outdoor pavilion, benches and lawn swings, and a large stable where visitors could rent horses and buggies to tour the surrounding countryside. 

Even more significant to the development of Bridgeville was the advent of commercial coal mining. The Pittsburgh Coal Seam was perhaps the most valuable mineral resource in North America in the late 1800s. Ranging from forty inches to six feet thick it was located at an elevation that produced outcroppings on all the hillsides in this area. 

Bridgeville was officially incorporated as a borough on July 27, 1901, from Upper St. Clair Township.

A mass shooting took place on August 4, 2009, in an LA Fitness health club near Bridgeville in Collier Township. The attack resulted in four deaths, including that of the perpetrator, who took his own life. Nine other people were injured.

<text>Carnegie () is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 8,134 in the 2020 census. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
Carnegie is named after Andrew Carnegie, who donated one of his libraries for the gesture. It was incorporated on March 1, 1894, from the boroughs of Chartiers and Mansfield (separated by Chartiers Creek). Later, the borough annexed part of Robinson Township (now Rosslyn Heights). Neighborhoods include Rosslyn Heights, Cubbage Hill, Irishtown, Forsythe Hill, Library Hill, and Old Mansfield.

Many neighborhoods were at one time or another SKRT mined for coal. The main employers were steel mills such as Superior Steel &amp; Union Electric Steel. Carnegie had a rail yard that had connections to several railroads early in the twentieth century, including the Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal railroad, and the Pennsylvania Railroad.

On August 25, 1923, an estimated 10,000–30,000 members of the Ku Klux Klan (from surrounding areas) marched there to celebrate a so-called &quot;Karnegie Day&quot; and target the heavily-Catholic town&#x27;s residents. The march was resisted by local residents, resulting in a riot which left injuries on both sides and the death of a Klansman.

In the 1970s, Carnegie suffered economically with the closure of the great steel mills such as J &amp; L in and around Pittsburgh.

In 2004, Carnegie was significantly damaged by flooding as a result of Hurricane Ivan. Much of the commercial section of the borough, as well as the borough&#x27;s Roman Catholic churches, was closed or damaged. But since 2014, Carnegie&#x27;s Main Street has rebounded with many new restaurants and small businesses.

<text>Castle Shannon is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 8,249 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==

The first families settled Castle Shannon in 1786 in pursuit of farmland and timber and is widely assumed to be the Haas family. The most prominent farm was owned by David Strawbridge. Following common practices of Irish settlers—primarily from Ulster—in the region to name places and farms after former or ancestral homes in Ireland, he named it Castle Shanahan.
Castleshanaghan is a townland in County Donegal, Ireland. Over time, the farm would lend its name to the area, as &quot;Shanahan&quot; would evolve into &quot;Shannon&quot;. In 1872, the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad line was completed, providing a direct link from Pittsburgh to the then-village of Castle Shannon. Development was stimulated by two years of free transportation and lumber transport given to anybody building a home.

In 1877, a second railroad was built from Finleyville through Castle Shannon to the West End neighborhood of Pittsburgh. In 1909, the right of way through the valley containing Castle Shannon was purchased by the Pittsburgh Railroad. This helped lead to Castle Shannon becoming a center for coal mining, with eight mines in operation in 1904. The Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railroad, still active today, came shortly afterward.

The First National Bank in Castle Shannon was the site of a much publicized bank robbery in 1917. $18,500 was taken in the robbery, of which $10,500 was immediately recovered from one man shot during the escape. The full sum was never recovered. A group of men gathered to chase down the robber to no avail. From that group, Elmer J Zeiler, a WWI Medal of Valor winner from the US and France, and a double Purple Heart recipient, was named the first Chief of Police in Castle Shannon when the police department was formed.

Castle Shannon was incorporated as a borough in 1919, formed from parts of Baldwin Township, Mt. Lebanon, and Bethel Township.

<text>Cheswick is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Allegheny River. The population was 1,672 as of the 2020 census. Cheswick Borough was incorporated in 1902. It is a residential suburb of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
Cheswick, named for a town in England, is a small town of about . The history of the lands of Cheswick seems to have belonged to the Keen family at least in part, for Archie Pillow, or Pillar, as spelled in old records, inherited land from the Keen family. That land, in part, is where Cheswick is today. Archie&#x27;s brother, George, once owned the second oldest house in the community. Thomas Pillow owned the land from Highland Avenue to the Harmar Township line.

The level land near the Allegheny River was used as farmland (Borland farm). Borland &amp; Truck farms sold vegetables to Pittsburgh in the days of the canal. Barges and rafts of lumber were floated down the river to the steel mills. The men were fed by women who took baked goods out to the slow-moving barges in boats. In the days of the canal, wealthy families built great Victorian houses along the canal. Later, when the railroad bought out the right of way, the noise and dust became disturbing and many houses became run down and neglected.

Among the early names are Borland, Pillows, Macleans, Wilsons, Stewarts, Lemons, Albertsons, Buntings, Cummings, Shoops and Armstrongs. The Armstrong family lived in Acmetonia until after the Civil War. One built the fine stone house next to the Cheswick Theater (which has since been demolished), and he served as postmaster in the borough.

Before the days of the railroad, a tavern was located where the former station would later be built. People traveling to Pittsburgh by carriage probably stopped for refreshment. The road between Pittsburgh and Freeport was filled by farmers driving cattle to market in Pittsburgh, peddler wagons taking goods to country housewives, businessmen going to Pittsburgh, and officials going to court for the day. When the Pennsylvania Railroad was completed, the land was divided and sold in sections and lots. For a time, few were sold and growth was slow. The town name became Lincoln but had to be changed, for there were other communities by the same name. It was not until 1902 that the name Cheswick was adopted at the first council meeting. The streets were named for trees, such as Beech, Pine and Spruce. The President of the council was H. J. Hutchinson. The second ordinance dealt with the public health of the community. Houses, sewage, garbage, slaughterhouses were considered and fines stated. Later ordinances provided for paved streets and sidewalks.

One of the first industries was the Penwick Distillery. In a large brick building, the liquor was stored for years before it was sold. Several small factories were built, but coal, river sand and gravel were the most important. Many of the residents traveled by train each day to work in offices and stores. The Cheswick Fire Department was founded in the early 1900s.

In early times, the children went to school near Deer Creek in Harmar Township. Later, a school was built on Pittsburgh Road not far from the site of the old Cheswick elementary school. The borough council met in the school building at that time, and all of its papers were kept there. In 1919, fire destroyed the interior of the old school, burning most of the records of the young borough of Cheswick. A newer and bigger Cheswick School was planned under the Allegheny Valley Joint Schools expansion program. Today, the old elementary school is part of the Cheswick Christian Academy.

The Presbyterian Church was originally part of the old church built in 1804 on the Denny farm. Around 1873, Mathew Maclean donated land for the Presbyterian Church, and it was built at a cost of $2,441.01 with a membership of seventeen. The Reverend James Boyd was an early minister of the Presbyterian faith who served the community.

One of the worst mining disasters in American history occurred at the Harwick Mine disaster in Cheswick on January 25, 1904. It killed an estimated 181 men.

Interstate 376, known (to east of downtown Pittsburgh) as the &quot;Parkway East&quot; by native Pittsburghers, runs through Churchill. Westbound I-376 from Churchill goes to Interstate 279 and downtown Pittsburgh, while eastbound I-376 goes to the Pennsylvania Turnpike. In addition, U.S. Route 22 (on the same road as I-376) travels through Churchill. Several bus lines of the Port Authority of Allegheny County travel through Churchill, offering service to downtown Pittsburgh west of Churchill, and also to Monroeville east of Pittsburgh, where Monroeville Mall and several Port Authority park-and-ride lots for bus commuters are located.

The Parkway East used to end at Churchill (in the traffic configuration just before it was extended to the Turnpike at Monroeville), with traffic having to continue ahead on U.S. 22—now business U.S. 22—to get from there to the Pennsylvania Turnpike. When the Parkway East ended there, there was a black-lettering-on-white-background sign &quot;PARKWAY ENDS&quot;, because straight ahead there began to be grade-level intersections.

== Education ==
Churchill is served by the Woodland Hills School District.

<doc id="131093" wikidata="Q1133095" url="?curid=131093" title="Clairton, Pennsylvania">
<text>Clairton is a city in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located along the Monongahela River and is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The population was 6,181 at the 2020 census. Under Pennsylvania legal classifications for local governments, Clairton is considered a third-class city. It is home to U.S. Steel&#x27;s Clairton Coke Works, the largest coke manufacturing facility in North America.

The city was the setting for the movie &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978), although none of the movie was actually filmed there (other mill towns in the Monongahela River Valley and elsewhere in the tri-state area were used).

The Montour Trail, a recreational rail-trail, extends from Clairton to Coraopolis, Pennsylvania.

==History==
Clairton&#x27;s existence dates to just after the turn of the 20th century, when the Crucible Steel Company acquired a large tract along the west side of the Monongahela River, approximately south of Pittsburgh. Soon after, the Carnegie Steel Company (later U.S. Steel) built an integrated steel mill and coke production facility, which eventually became one of the world&#x27;s largest.

The site had more than of level land suitable for a large industrial complex. On April 12, 1903, Clairton was incorporated as a borough, and on January 1, 1922, Clairton was incorporated as a City of the Third Class with a population of approximately 11,000. This incorporation was prompted by industry, which was taxed by the three boroughs - Clairton, Wilson and North Clairton - which were chartered separately prior to the incorporation of the City of Clairton.

During the next several decades, growth and advancement indicated a thriving city. As the steel mill and coke production facilities expanded, the population of Clairton grew. Clairton took on a life of its own, including a business district and educational, religious, and cultural facilities. The city peaked in the late 1950s, and has been in decline since.

In the late 1950s, Clairton High School (CHS) had a large student body, and the city had a &quot;feeder&quot; system of public and parochial elementary schools. The CHS student body was soon siphoned off, however, by new schools in Elizabeth Borough, Snowden Township, and Jefferson Borough. During the mid-1950s and into the 1960s, CHS was a Class AAA competitor in the formidable Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League (WPIAL), playing against high schools in other mill towns up and down the Monongahela River Valley.

With the decline of the steel industry in the 1980s, Clairton began to experience severe problems in its employment and tax base, which spurred a major economic shock to the community. In 1988, Clairton was designated a distressed municipality by Pennsylvania&#x27;s Department of Community Affairs (DCA). Pursuant to Act 47 of 1987 (the Financially Distressed Municipalities Act), DCA commissioned the development of a recovery plan for Clairton. By 1988, the Clairton School District had consolidated its entire system into a single building (a remodeled version of the high school) and closed its other schools. Clairton High now competes at the Class A level in the WPIAL. The high school football team has had national prominence for recent success.

==Geography==
Clairton is located at (40.296419, -79.887090).

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land, and (8.31%) is water.

===Surrounding and adjacent neighborhoods===
A majority of Clairton is bordered by land with Jefferson Hills with a short border with West Mifflin to the north.

Across the Monongahela River, Clairton runs adjacent with Glassport to the north and northeast (direct link via Clairton-Glassport Bridge) and follows the curve down the river with Lincoln from the northeast to the southeast.

==Demographics==
As of the 2000 census, there were 8,491 people, 3,710 households, and 2,203 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 4,350 housing units at an average density of .

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.73% of the population. 17.5% were of Italian, 9.8% German, 9.8% Irish, 6.7% Slovak and 5.0% English ancestry according to the census. 96.4% spoke English, 1.3% Italian and 1.1% French as their first language.

There were 3,710 households, out of which 23.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 34.3% were married couples living together, 19.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 40.6% were non-families. Of these households, 36.4% consisted of individuals, and 18.5% had someone living alone who was 65 or older. The average household had 2.25 people and the average family size was 2.92.

The population was spread out, with 22.1% under the age of 18, 7.2% from 18 to 24, 25.0% from 25 to 44, 21.6% from 45 to 64, and 24.0% who were 65 or older. The median age was 42. For every 100 females, there were 83.7 males. For every 100 females 18 and over, there were 78.3 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $25,596, and the median income for a family was $31,539. Males had a median income of $29,399 versus $21,743 for females. The per capita income for the city was $14,608. About 15.4% of families and 19.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 32.9% of those under age 18 and 14.0% of those age 65 or over.

==Government and politics==
==In popular culture==
The city was the setting for the movie &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978), the steel town where the American characters live. None of the movie was actually filmed there; other mill towns in the Monongahela River Valley and elsewhere in the tri-state area were used. Even the opening scene, which features a large sign saying &quot;Welcome to Clairton, City of Prayer,&quot; was shot in Mingo Junction, Ohio. The phrasing on the sign is based on smaller signs posted at the city&#x27;s boundaries during the mid-1960s as a response to the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1963 ban on sponsored school prayer.

Much of the 1979 Marvel comic book &quot;ROM: Spaceknight&quot; is set in a fictional version of Clairton, located in West Virginia instead of Pennsylvania. In 2011, former Marvel Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter explained that the change in location was made to benefit the story.

<text>Crafton is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, west of downtown Pittsburgh. The population was 6,099 at the 2020 census. It is a residential suburb of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. 

==History==
Prior to European colonial usurpation, the area was inhabited and controlled by the Seneca Indians. It is believed the legendary chief of the Seneca, Cornplanter, called the area &quot;Killemun&quot;. But even before the Seneca came, the Crafton/Ingram area was inhabited. In her 1993 historical account, local historian and Crafton-native, Betsy Martin, writes that, “Burial mounds from a much earlier pre-Columbian Adena Culture were found farther down the [Chartiers] creek toward the ‘Rocks’ in the vicinity of the Fall Hole…” It is likely Martin is referring to a mound site near the junction of the Creek with the Ohio River, a site which underwent excavations in 1896 by the Carnegie Museum. The excavation unearthed at least 33 burials, all “Early Woodland Adena in affiliation.” The Indians who built the mounds are believed to be Algonquin. While there is no way of knowing exactly which mounds Martin is describing, the reality is that such ancient interment mounds and early-indigenous habitation sites were strewn across the entire Chartiers Valley region, including Crafton/Ingram. Throughout the 20th Century, however, most of the sites were destroyed as a result of industrial development and building construction.

For obvious reasons, the Chartiers Creek was the dominant geographical feature during the premodern era, winding a northwesterly path to its terminus in the Ohio River at McKees Rocks. By 1749/1750, The French, under the aegis of King Louis XV, were staking land claims throughout the creek valley and surrounding forested hills and open meadows. George Washington passed through the area for the first time in 1752, along with his guide, Christopher Gist.

Crafton is named after James S. Craft, a frontier attorney who was granted land near the &quot;forks of the Ohio&quot; in present-day Oakland. The sale of this land part financed purchases of land in the Chartiers valley. Charles Craft, son of James, divided the land into lots on the death of his father and submitted it to the Allegheny County Courthouse as Crafton. Following a period of building, the borough was incorporated on January 8, 1892, with Charles as the first burgess.

Crafton was linked to downtown Pittsburgh by trolley in 1896. The service ended when the Fort Pitt Bridge was built without trolley tracks.

Crafton is located at (40.433869, -80.068146).

<doc id="131098" wikidata="Q1133036" url="?curid=131098" title="Dormont, Pennsylvania">
<text>Dormont is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 8,244 at the 2020 census. It is a residential suburb of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Loosely translated, Dormont means &quot;Mountain of Gold&quot; in French.

==History==

The territory in which Dormont Borough is situated was held by the Delaware and Shawnee tribes until 1768, when the territory was part of the transaction in which Fort Stanwix was purchased from the Six Nations. In following years, Dormont&#x27;s area was part of Cumberland County, Pitt Township in Bedford County, Penn Township in Washington County, and finally, St. Clair Township in Allegheny County in 1788.

Dormont was originally fashioned from parts of Scott and Union Townships. An order of incorporation was signed on March 31, 1909, making Dormont the first independent municipality in the South Hills of Allegheny County. Municipal officials initially wanted to name the new community &quot;Mt. Lebanon&quot;; however, objections were raised by their as yet unincorporated neighbors to the south, who eventually adopted the name. Instead, the name Dormont was chosen from the Americanized version of the French term &quot;mont d&#x27;or&quot;, loosely translated as &quot;Mountain of Gold.&quot;

The first election of borough officials was held on April 27, 1909. Dormont later annexed part of Scott Township in 1909, two additional parts of Union Township in 1913 and 1916, and a portion of Mt. Lebanon Township in January 1921, giving it a total area of just less than one square mile. With the construction of the streetcar tunnel and the Liberty Tunnels came rapid growth.

Once the borough of Dormont was incorporated in 1909, at least 30 different streets were given new names. Today, all but two of Dormont&#x27;s &quot;side streets&quot; are designated as avenues, the exceptions being Memorial Drive and Park Blvd. Two of Dormont&#x27;s mainline streets, Scott Road and McFarland Road, are two-lane &quot;borough line&quot; streets in which one lane is located in Dormont and the other in Mt. Lebanon. The northern stretch of another &quot;borough line&quot; street, McNeilly Avenue, runs through Dormont on one side and the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Brookline on the other. Before the incorporation and street name changes, Dormont actually had four designated &quot;streets&quot;: Beech St. (Dwight Ave.), Sycamore St. (Philadelphia Ave.), Sylvester St. (Texas Ave.) and &quot;C&quot; St. (Miles Ave.).

In June 2020, the Dormont Borough Council approved a comprehensive plan for the next ten years, which includes provisions for land use, housing, transportation, economic development, parks and recreation, community facilities, historic preservation, sustainability, and public engagement. The council also adopted a $9.8 million budget for 2021 without a tax increase for residents. The Keystone Oaks School District, after a stint of fully remote learning, resumed in-person instruction for all students starting in February 2021.

Its citizens enjoy one of the largest swimming pools in Pennsylvania (&gt;60,000 square feet), two parks, basketball and tennis courts, two Little League fields, a fine library, an impressive volunteer-built children&#x27;s playground, as well as seasonal activities for both children and adults. &quot;Dormont Day,&quot; the annual Fourth of July park-wide event, is the highlight of the summer season and features all day family entertainment beginning with the 8:00 a.m. Twenty-One Gun Salute and culminating with one of the most spectacular fireworks displays for a community of this size. During the day, park goers are treated to live music, picnics, food booths, games, pony rides, and youth foot races. In the fall, Dormont hosts the Dormont Street and Music Festival, featuring two stages of bands playing a variety of music from 2:00 - 10:00 PM.

Dormont is home to one of the largest municipal pools in Pennsylvania and hosts several community events throughout the year, including Dormont Day, Dormont Street Fair &amp; Music Festival, and Dormont Winter Festival &amp; Light Up Night.

Organizations such as the Dormont Historical Society, the Dormont Library, the Dormont Arts &amp; Culture Committee, and the Dormont Community Development Corporation work to promote and preserve the culture of Dormont.

==Government and politics==
==Education==
Since 1965, Dormont&#x27;s school system, Keystone Oaks School District, is a jointure with the boroughs of Castle Shannon and Green Tree. The borough itself includes Dormont Elementary School, Keystone Oaks Middle School and Keystone Oaks High School. Oddly enough, none of the three communities which make up the Keystone Oaks School District are contiguous. Also, the Keystone Oaks Middle and High Schools are located just outside the Dormont borough line in neighboring Mt. Lebanon.

Dormont Elementary School is located on the site of the old Dormont High School on Annapolis Ave. When the Keystone Oaks High School building was completed in 1969, the old high school was changed to Jay Neff Middle School, named after the superintendent of Dormont schools. In 1996, the old middle school was demolished, and Keystone Oaks High School expanded to include Keystone Oaks Middle School. A brand-new building for the grade school was then built, bringing together students from the two previous grade schools, Kelton and Hillsdale. The Kelton School building, located on a hillside adjacent to Keystone Oaks (corner of Kelton &amp; Delwood Aves.), was razed also in 1996; it is now occupied with a soccer field. Hillsdale School (Hillsdale Ave. between Glenmore and Espy Aves.) is now the Dormont Municipal Building which also houses the Dormont Historical Society.

Dormont is also home to the South Hills Beauty Academy and the Pittsburgh Bartending School.

==Infrastructure==
Dormont has a comprehensive public works department responsible for services like street maintenance, snow removal, leaf collection, recycling, trash collection, and operating the Dormont Stormwater Authority.

<text>East Pittsburgh is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, approximately southeast of the confluence of the Monongahela and the Allegheny rivers at Pittsburgh. The population in 1900 stood at 2,883, and in 1910, at 5,615. As of the 2020 census, the borough population was 1,927, having fallen from 6,079 in 1940.

==History==
The first transmission from pioneering radio station KDKA (AM) was made from East Pittsburgh on November 2, 1920.

In 1928, an early demonstration of a new broadcast medium was conducted at the Westinghouse laboratories in East Pittsburgh. Eventually, the new medium became known as television. Vladimir Zworykin worked for Westinghouse Electric Corporation at that time. He lived in the borough of Wilkinsburg. The Westinghouse Works became the Research and Business Park &quot;Keystone Commons&quot; in 1989.

The East Pittsburgh School District included Bessemer Avenue Elementary School and East Pittsburgh Junior/Senior High School on Howard Street. East Pittsburgh&#x27;s school colors were green and white, and its athletic teams were called the Shamrocks.

During the 1970–71 school year, the East Pittsburgh School District was merged, by court order, with the neighboring Turtle Creek School District for the following year. In the final basketball game between the two rivals, the Shamrocks defeated Turtle Creek, 65–63.
