<text>In urban planning, the grid plan, grid street plan, or gridiron plan is a type of city plan in which streets run at right angles to each other, forming a .

Two inherent characteristics of the grid plan, frequent intersections and orthogonal geometry, facilitate movement. The geometry helps with orientation and wayfinding and its frequent intersections with the choice and directness of route to desired destinations.

In ancient Rome, the grid plan method of land measurement was called centuriation. The grid plan dates from antiquity and originated in multiple cultures; some of the earliest planned cities were built using grid plans in the Indian subcontinent.

==History==

===Ancient grid plans===

By 2600 BC, Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, major cities of the Indus Valley civilization, were built with blocks divided by a grid of straight streets, running north–south and east–west. Each block was subdivided by small lanes. The cities and monasteries of Sirkap, Taxila and Thimi (in the Indus and Kathmandu Valleys), dating from the 1st millennium BC to the 11th century AD, also had grid-based designs.

A workers&#x27; village (2570–2500 BC) at Giza, Egypt, housed a rotating labor force and was laid out in blocks of long galleries separated by streets in a formal grid. Many pyramid-cult cities used a common orientation: a north–south axis from the royal palace and an east–west axis from the temple, meeting at a central plaza where King and God merged and crossed.

Hammurabi king of the Babylonian Empire in the 18th century BC, ordered the rebuilding of Babylon: constructing and restoring temples, city walls, public buildings, and irrigation canals. The streets of Babylon were wide and straight, intersected approximately at right angles, and were paved with bricks and bitumen.

The tradition of grid plans is continuous in China from the 15th century BC onward in the traditional urban planning of various ancient Chinese states. Guidelines put into written form in the Kaogongji during the Spring and Autumn period (770-476 BC) stated: &quot;a capital city should be square on plan. Three gates on each side of the perimeter lead into the nine main streets that crisscross the city and define its grid-pattern. And for its layout the city should have the Royal Court situated in the south, the Marketplace in the north, the Imperial Ancestral Temple in the east and the Altar to the Gods of Land and Grain in the west.&quot;

Teotihuacan, near modern-day Mexico City, is the largest ancient grid-plan site in the Americas. The city&#x27;s grid covered 21 square kilometres (8 square miles).

Perhaps the most well-known grid system is that spread through the colonies of the Roman Empire. The archetypal Roman Grid was introduced to Italy first by the Greeks, with such information transferred by way of trade and conquest.

====Ancient Greece====

Although the idea of the grid was present in Hellenic societal and city planning, it was not pervasive prior to the 5th century BC. However, it slowly gained primacy through the work of Hippodamus of Miletus (498–408 BC), who planned and replanned many Greek cities in accordance with this form. The concept of a grid as the ideal method of town planning had become widely accepted by the time of Alexander the Great. His conquests were a step in the propagation of the grid plan throughout colonies, some as far-flung as Taxila in Pakistan, that would later be mirrored by the expansion of the Roman Empire. The Greek grid had its streets aligned roughly in relation to the cardinal points and generally looked to take advantage of visual cues based on the hilly landscape typical of Greece and Asia Minor. The street grid consisted of &quot;plateiai&quot; and &quot;stenophoi&quot; (equivalent to Roman &quot;decumani&quot; and &quot;cardines&quot;). This was probably best exemplified in Priene, in present-day western Turkey, where the orthogonal city grid was based on the cardinal points, on sloping terrain that struck views out towards a river and the city of Miletus.

====Ancient Rome====
The Etruscan people, whose territories in Italy encompassed what would eventually become Rome, founded what is now the city of Marzabotto at the end of the 6th century BC. Its layout was based on Greek Ionic ideas, and it was here that the main east–west and north–south axes of a town (the &quot;decumanus maximus&quot; and &quot;cardo maximus&quot; respectively) could first be seen in Italy. According to Stanislawski (1946), the Romans did use grids until the time of the late Republic or early Empire, when they introduced &quot;centuriation&quot;, a system which they spread around the Mediterranean and into northern Europe later on.

The military expansion of this period facilitated the adoption of the grid form as standard: the Romans established &quot;castra&quot; (forts or camps) first as military centres; some of them developed into administrative hubs. The Roman grid was similar in form to the Greek version of a grid but allowed for practical considerations. For example, Roman &quot;castra&quot; were often sited on flat land, especially close to or on important nodes like river crossings or intersections of trade routes. The dimensions of the &quot;castra&quot; were often standard, with each of its four walls generally having a length of . Familiarity was the aim of such standardisation: soldiers could be stationed anywhere around the Empire, and orientation would be easy within established towns if they had a standard layout. Each would have the aforementioned &quot;decumanus maximus&quot; and &quot;cardo maximus&quot; at its heart, and their intersection would form the forum, around which would be sited important public buildings. Indeed, such was the degree of similarity between towns that Higgins states that soldiers &quot;would be housed at the same address as they moved from &quot;castra&quot; to &quot;castra&quot;&quot;. Pompeii has been cited by both Higgins and Laurence as the best-preserved example of the Roman grid.

Outside of the castra, large tracts of land were also divided in accordance with the grid within the walls. These were typically per side (called &quot;centuria&quot;) and contained 100 parcels of land (each called &quot;heredium&quot;). The &quot;decumanus maximus&quot; and &quot;cardo maximus&quot; extended from the town gates out towards neighbouring settlements. These were lined up to be as straight as possible, only deviating from their path due to natural obstacles that prevented a direct route.

While the imposition of only one town form regardless of region could be seen as an imposition of imperial authority, there is no doubting the practical reasoning behind the formation of the Roman grid. Under Roman guidance, the grid was designed for efficiency and interchangeability, both facilitated by and aiding the expansion of their empire.

===Asia from the first millennium AD===

As Japan and the Korean peninsula became politically centralized in the 7th century AD, those societies adopted Chinese grid-planning principles in numerous locations. In Korea, Gyeongju, the capital of Unified Silla, and Sanggyeong, the capital of Balhae, adapted the Tang dynasty Chinese model. The ancient capitals of Japan, such as Fujiwara-Kyô (AD 694–710), Nara (Heijô-Kyô, AD 710–784), and Kyoto (Heian-Kyô, AD 794–1868) also adapted from Tang&#x27;s capital, Chang&#x27;an. However, for reasons of defense, the planners of Tokyo eschewed the grid, opting instead for an irregular network of streets surrounding the Edo Castle grounds. In later periods, some parts of Tokyo were grid-planned, but grid plans are generally rare in Japan, and the Japanese addressing system is accordingly based on increasingly fine subdivisions, rather than a grid.

The grid-planning tradition in Asia continued through the beginning of the 20th century, with Sapporo, Japan (est. 1868) following a grid plan under American influence.

===Europe and its colonies (12th-17th centuries)===

New European towns were planned using grids beginning in the 12th century, most prodigiously in the bastides of southern France that were built during the 13th and 14th centuries. Medieval European new towns using grid plans were widespread, ranging from Wales to the Florentine region. Many were built on ancient grids originally established as Roman colonial outposts. In the British Isles, the planned new town system involving a grid street layout was part of the system of burgage. An example of a medieval planned city in The Netherlands is Elburg. Bury St Edmunds is an example of a town planned on a grid system in the late 11th century.

The Roman model was also used in Spanish settlements during the Reconquista of Ferdinand and Isabella. It was subsequently applied in the new cities established during the Spanish colonization of the Americas, after the founding of San Cristóbal de La Laguna (Canary Islands) in 1496. In 1573, King Philip II of Spain compiled the Laws of the Indies to guide the construction and administration of colonial communities. The Laws specified a square or rectangular central plaza with eight principal streets running from the plaza&#x27;s corners. Hundreds of grid-plan communities throughout the Americas were established according to this pattern, echoing the practices of earlier Indian civilizations.

The baroque capital city of Malta, Valletta, dating back to the 16th century, was built following a rigid grid plan of uniformly designed houses, dotted with palaces, churches and squares.

The grid plan became popular with the start of the Renaissance in Northern Europe. In 1606, the newly founded city of Mannheim in Germany was the first Renaissance city laid out on the grid plan. Later came the New Town in Edinburgh and almost the entire city centre of Glasgow, and many planned communities and cities in Australia, Canada and the United States.

Derry, constructed in 1613–1618, was the first planned city in Ireland. The central diamond within a walled city with four gates was considered a good design for defence. The grid pattern was widely copied in the colonies of British North America.

=== Russia (18th century) ===

In Russia the first planned city was St. Petersburg founded in 1703 by Peter I. Being aware of the modern European construction experience which he examined in the years of his Grand Embassy to Europe, the Czar ordered Domenico Trezzini to elaborate the first general plan of the city. The project of this architect for Vasilyevsky Island was a typical rectangular grid of streets (originally intended to be canals, like in Amsterdam), with three lengthwise thoroughfares, rectangularly crossed with about 30 crosswise streets.

The shape of street blocks on Vasilyevsky Island are the same, as was later implemented in the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811 for Manhattan: elongated rectangles. The longest side of each block faces the relatively narrow street with a numeric name (in Petersburg they are called &quot;Liniya&quot; (Line)) while the shortest side faces wide avenues. To denote avenues in Petersburg, a special term &quot;prospekt&quot; was introduced. Inside the grid of Vasilyevsky Island there are three prospekts, named &quot;Bolshoi&quot; (&quot;Big&quot;), &quot;Sredniy &quot;(&quot;Middle&quot;) and &quot;Maly&quot; (&quot;Small&quot;) while the far ends of each line cross with the embankments of Bolshaya Neva and Smolenka rivers in the delta of the Neva River.

The peculiarity of &#x27;lines&#x27; (streets) naming in this grid is that are each side of street has its own number, so one &#x27;line&#x27; is a side of a street, not the whole street. The numbering is latently zero-based, however the supposed &quot;zero line&quot; has its proper name &quot;Kadetskaya liniya&quot;, while the opposite side of this street is called the &#x27;1-st Line&#x27;. Next street is named the &#x27;2-nd Line&#x27; on the eastern side, and the &#x27;3-rd Line&#x27; on the western side. After the reorganization of house numbering in 1834 and 1858 the even house numbers are used on the odd-numbered lines, and respectively odd house numbers are used for the even-numbered lines. The maximum numbers for &#x27;lines&#x27; in Petersburg are 28-29th lines.

Later in the middle of the 18th century another grid of rectangular blocks with the numbered streets appeared in the continental part of the city: 13 streets named from the &#x27;1-st Rota&#x27; up to the &#x27;13-th Rota&#x27;, where the companies (, ) of the Izmaylovsky Regiment were located.

===Early United States (17th-19th centuries)===
Many of the earliest cities in the United States, such as Boston, did not start with a grid system. However, even in pre-revolutionary days some cities saw the benefits of such a layout. New Haven Colony, one of the earliest colonies in America, was designed with a tiny 9-square grid at its founding in 1638. On a grander scale, Philadelphia was designed on a rectilinear street grid in 1682, one of the first cities in North America to use a grid system. At the urging of city founder William Penn, surveyor Thomas Holme designed a system of wide streets intersecting at right angles between the Schuylkill River to the west and the Delaware River to the east, including five squares of dedicated parkland. Penn advertised this orderly design as a safeguard against overcrowding, fire, and disease, which plagued European cities. Holme drafted an ideal version of the grid, but alleyways sprouted within and between larger blocks as the city took shape. As the United States expanded westward, grid-based city planning modeled on Philadelphia&#x27;s layout would become popular among frontier cities, making grids ubiquitous across the country.

Another well-known grid plan is the plan for New York City formulated in the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, a proposal by the state legislature of New York for the development of most of Manhattan above Houston Street.
Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States, was planned under French-American architect Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant. Under the L&#x27;Enfant plan, the original District of Columbia was developed using a grid plan that is interrupted by diagonal avenues, most famously Pennsylvania Avenue. These diagonals are often connected by traffic circles, such as Dupont Circle and Washington Circle. As the city grew, the plan was duplicated to cover most of the remainder of the capital. Meanwhile, the core of the city faced disarray and the McMillan Plan, led by Senator James McMillan, was adopted to build a National Mall and a parks system that is still today a jewel of the city.

Often, some of the streets in a grid are numbered (First, Second, etc.), lettered, or arranged in alphabetical order. Downtown San Diego uses all three schemes: north–south streets are numbered from west to east, and east–west streets are split between a lettered series running southward from A through L and a series of streets named after trees or plants, running northward alphabetically from Ash to Walnut. As in many cities, some of these streets have been given new names violating the system (the former D Street is now Broadway, the former 12th Avenue is now Park Boulevard, etc.); this has meant that 2nd, not 1st, is the most common street name in the United States.

An exception to the typical, uniform grid is the plan of Savannah, Georgia (1733), known as the Oglethorpe Plan. It is a composite, cellular city block consisting of four large corner blocks, four small blocks in between and a public square in the centre; the entire composition of approximately ten acres (four hectares) is known as a ward. Its cellular structure includes all the primary land uses of a neighborhood and has for that reason been called fractal. Its street configuration presages modern traffic calming techniques applied to uniform grids where certain selected streets become discontinuous or narrow, thus discouraging through traffic. The configuration also represents an example of functional shared space, where pedestrian and vehicular traffic can safely and comfortably coexist.

In the westward development of the United States, the use of the grid plan was nearly universal in the construction of new settlements, such as in Salt Lake City (1870), Dodge City (1872) and Oklahoma City (1890). In these western cities the streets were numbered even more carefully than in the east to suggest future prosperity and metropolitan status.

One of the main advantages of the grid plan was that it allowed the rapid subdivision and auction of a large parcel of land. For example, when the legislature of the Republic of Texas decided in 1839 to move the capital to a new site along the Colorado River, the functioning of the government required the rapid population of the town, which was named Austin. Charged with the task, Edwin Waller designed a fourteen-block grid that fronted the river on 640 acres (exactly 1 square mile; about 2.6 km2). After surveying the land, Waller organized the almost immediate sale of 306 lots, and by the end of the year the entire Texas government had arrived by oxcart at the new site. Apart from the speed of surveying advantage, the rationale at the time of the grid&#x27;s adoption in this and other cities remains obscure.

===Early 19th century – Australasia===
In 1836 William Light drew up his plans for Adelaide, South Australia, spanning the River Torrens. Two areas south (the city centre) and north (North Adelaide) of the river were laid out in grid pattern, with the city surrounded by the Adelaide Park Lands.

Hoddle Grid is the name given to the layout of Melbourne, Victoria, named after the surveyor Robert Hoddle, who marked it out in 1837 establishing the first formal town plan. This grid of streets, laid out when there were only a few hundred settlers, became the nucleus for what is now a city of over 5 million people, the city of Melbourne. The unusual dimensions of the allotments and the incorporation of narrow &#x27;little&#x27; streets were the result of compromise between Hoddle&#x27;s desire to employ the regulations established in 1829 by previous New South Wales Governor Ralph Darling, requiring square blocks and wide, spacious streets and Bourke&#x27;s desire for rear access ways (now the &#x27;little&#x27; streets, for example Little Collins Street).

The city of Christchurch, New Zealand, was planned by Edward Jollie in 1850.

====Town acre====

The term &quot;town acre&quot; (often spelt with initial capital letters) may have originated with Edward Gibbon Wakefield who, in the 1830s, was involved in various schemes to promote the colonisation of South Australia and its capital, Adelaide, and, as founder of the New Zealand Company, the plans for Wellington, New Plymouth and Nelson. All of these towns were laid out on a grid plan, so it was easy to divide the land into acre plots of one chain by one furlong, (approximately 0.4 ha.), and these became known as town acres. Adelaide was divided into 1042 Town Acres. Maps showing the divisions of the town acres are available for Adelaide, Nelson, and Wellington.

===Late 19th century to the present===
Ildefons Cerdà, a Spanish civil engineer, defined a concept of urban planning, based on the grid, that he applied to the Eixample of Barcelona. The Eixample grid introduced innovative design elements which were exceptional at the time and even unique among subsequent grid plans:
* a very large block measuring , far larger than the old city blocks and larger than any Roman, Greek blocks and their mutations (see drawing below);
* a road width (right of way) compared with mostly 3 m in the old city;
* square blocks with truncated corners; and
* major roads, perpendicular and diagonal, measuring in width.
These innovations he based on functional grounds: the block size, to enable the creation of a quiet interior open space (60 m by 60 m) and allow ample sunlight and ventilation to its perimeter buildings; the rectilinear geometry, the wide streets and boulevards to sustain high mobility and the truncated corners to facilitate turning of carts and coaches and particularly vehicles on fixed rails.

In maps of larger American cities, the downtown areas are almost always grids. These areas represent the original land dimensions of the founded city, generally around one square mile. Some cities expanded the grid further out from the centre, but maps also show that, in general, as the distance from the centre increases, a variety of patterns emerge in no particular discernible order. In juxtaposition to the grid, they appear random. These new patterns have been systematically classified and their design characteristics measured.

In the United States, the grid system was widely used in most major cities and their suburbs until the 1960s. However, during the 1920s, the rapid adoption of the automobile caused a panic among urban planners, who, based on observation, claimed that speeding cars would eventually kill tens of thousands of small children per year. Apparently, at this early stage of the car&#x27;s entry into the grid, the streets of major cities worldwide were the scene of virtual &quot;slaughter&quot; as the fatality rate in proportion to population was more than double the current rate. In 2009, after several decades of road safety improvements and a continuous decline in fatalities, an estimated 33,963 people died in motor vehicle traffic crashes and, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, &quot;Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for children from 3 to 14 years old.&quot; Planners, therefore, called for an inwardly focused &quot;superblock&quot; arrangement that minimized through automobile traffic and discouraged cars from traveling on anything but arterial roads; traffic generators, such as apartment complexes and shops, would be restricted to the edges of the superblock, along the arterial. This paradigm prevailed between about 1930 and 1960, especially in Los Angeles, where notable examples include Leimert Park (an early example) and Panorama City (a late-period one).

A prominent 20th century urbanist, Lewis Mumford, severely criticized some of the grid&#x27;s characteristics: &quot;With a T-square and a triangle, finally, the municipal engineer could, without the slightest training as either an architect or a sociologist, &#x27;plan&#x27; a metropolis, with its standard lots, its standard blocks, its standard street widths, in short, with its standardized comparable, and replaceable parts. The new gridiron plans were spectacular in their inefficiency and waste. By usually failing to discriminate sufficiently between main arteries and residential streets, the first were not made wide enough while the second were usually too wide for purely neighborhood functions... as for its contribution to the permanent social functions of the city, the anonymous gridiron plan proved empty.&quot;

In the 1960s, traffic engineers and urban planners abandoned the grid virtually wholesale in favor of a &quot;street hierarchy&quot;. This is a thoroughly &quot;asymmetric&quot; street arrangement in which a residential subdivision—often surrounded by a noise wall or a security gate—is completely separated from the road network except for one or two connections to arterial roads. In a way, this is a return to medieval styles: as noted in Spiro Kostof&#x27;s seminal history of urban design, &quot;The City Shaped&quot;, there is a strong resemblance between the street arrangements of modern American suburbs and those of medieval Arab and Moorish cities. In each case, the community unit at hand—the clan or extended family in the Muslim world, the economically homogeneous subdivision in modern suburbia—isolates itself from the larger urban scene by using dead ends and &quot;culs-de-sac&quot;.

====Milton Keynes====

One famous grid system is in the British new town of Milton Keynes. In this planned city, which began construction in 1967, a system of ten &quot;horizontal&quot; (roughly east–west) and eleven &quot;vertical&quot; (roughly north–south) roads was used, with roundabouts at each intersection. The horizontal roads were all given names ending in &#x27;way&#x27; and H numbers (for &#x27;horizontal&#x27;, e.g., H3 Monks Way). The vertical roads were given names ending in &#x27;street&#x27; and V numbers (for &#x27;vertical&#x27;, e.g., V6 Grafton Street). Each grid road was spaced roughly one kilometre along from the next, forming squares of approximately one square kilometre. Each square and each roundabout was given its own name. The system provided very easy transport within the city, although it confused visitors who were unfamiliar with the system. The grid squares thus formed are far larger than the city blocks described earlier, and the road layouts within the grid squares are generally &#x27;organic&#x27; in form – matching the street hierarchy model described above.

== Benefits and criticisms ==

===Financial cost===

&quot;Street width&quot;, or right of way (ROW), influences the amount of land that is devoted to streets, which becomes unavailable for development and therefore represents an opportunity cost. The wider the street, the higher the opportunity cost. Street width is determined by circulation and aesthetic considerations and is not dependent on the pattern configuration. Any configuration can have wide or narrow streets.

&quot;Street length&quot; influences proportionately the number of street components that have to be constructed such as pavement, curbs and sidewalks, storm sewers and drains, light poles, and trees. The street length of a given area of development depends on the frequency at which streets occur which in turn depends on the length and width of a block. The higher the frequency of streets the longer is their total length. The smaller the block dimensions the higher the frequency of the streets. As the frequency of street increases so does the number of intersections. Intersections normally cost more than straight street length because they are labour-intensive and require street and traffic signage.

&quot;Pavement width&quot; influences the cost by affecting the amount of materials and labour required to provide a finished road surface. Pavement width is generally based on traffic engineering considerations and is not dependent on pattern configuration. As with the street width, any pattern can have wide or narrow pavements.
Of all three factors that affect cost, street width, street length and pavement width, only street length is pattern dependent. An objective cost comparison would, therefore, rely on this variable with the full understanding that the other variables, though optional, can play a role.

Traditional orthogonal grid patterns generally have greater street frequencies than discontinuous patterns. For example, Portland&#x27;s block is 200 feet × 200 feet while Miletus&#x27; is half that size and Timgad&#x27;s half again (see diagram). Houston, Sacramento and Barcelona are progressively bigger reaching up to four times the area of Portland&#x27;s block. New York&#x27;s 1811 plan (see above) has blocks of . in width and variable lengths ranging from about to feet. The corresponding frequency of streets for each of these block sizes affects the street length.

A simple example of a grid street pattern (see diagram) illustrates the progressive reduction in &quot;total&quot; street length (the sum of all individual street lengths) and the corresponding increase in block length. For a corresponding reduction of one, two, three and four streets within this parcel, the street length is reduced from an original total of to linear feet, a 39% reduction. Simultaneously, block lengths increase from 200 × 200 feet to 1240 × 200 feet. When all five blocks have reached the ultimate size of four street lengths out of total eight have been eliminated. Block lengths of or larger rarely appear in grid plans and are not recommended as they hinder pedestrian movement (Pedestrianism, below). From the pedestrian perspective, the smaller the block is, the easier the navigation and the more direct the route. Consequently, the finer grids are preferred.

Patterns that incorporate discontinuous street types such as crescents and culs-de-sac have not, in general, regarded pedestrian movement as a priority and, consequently, have produced blocks that are usually in the range and often exceed it. As a result, street frequency drops and so does the &quot;total&quot; street length and, therefore, the cost. In general, it is not the street pattern per se that affects costs but the frequency of streets that it either necessitates or purposely incorporates.

An inherent advantage of the orthogonal geometry of a proper grid is its tendency to yield regular lots in well-packed sequences. This maximizes the use of the land of the block; it does not, however, affect street frequency. Any frequency of orthogonal streets produces the same packing effect. Orthogonal geometry also minimizes disputes over lot boundaries and maximizes the number of lots that could front a given street. John Randal said Manhattan&#x27;s grid plan facilitated &quot;buying, selling and improving real estate&quot;.

Another important aspect of street grids and the use of rectilinear blocks is that traffic flows of either pedestrians, cars, or both, only cross at right angles. This is an important traffic safety feature, since no one entering the intersection needs to look over their shoulder to see oncoming traffic. Any time traffic flows meet at an acute angle, someone cannot see traffic approaching them. The grid is thus a geometric response to our human physiology. It is very likely the original purpose of grid layouts comes from the Athenian Agora. Before the grid organization, markets were laid out randomly in a field with traffic approaches at odd angles. This caused carts and wagons to turn over due to frequent collisions. Laying out the market stalls into regularized rows at right angles solved this problem and was later built into the Athenian Agora and copied ever since.

===Ecological features, rainwater absorption, and pollutant generation===

Typical uniform grids are unresponsive to topography. Priene&#x27;s plan, for example, is set on a hill side and most of its north–south streets are stepped, a feature that would have made them inaccessible to carts, chariots and loaded animals. Many modern cities, such as San Francisco, Vancouver, and Saint John, New Brunswick, follow Priene&#x27;s example. In a modern context, steep grades limit accessibility by car, and more so by bicycle, on foot, or wheelchair, particularly in cold climates.

The same inflexibility of the grid leads to disregarding environmentally sensitive areas such as small streams and creeks or mature woodlots in preference for the application of the immutable geometry. It is said of the New York City grid plan that it flattened all obstacles in its way. By contrast, recent discontinuous street patterns follow the configuration of natural features without disrupting them. The grid represents a rationalist, reductionist solution to a multifaceted issue.

The grid&#x27;s inherent high street and intersection frequencies produce large areas of impermeable surfaces in the street pavement and the sidewalks. In comparison with recent networks with discontinuous street types, grids can be up to 30% higher in impermeable surfaces attributable to roads. The emerging environmental priority of retaining as much as 90% of rain water on site becomes problematic with high percentages of impermeable surfaces. And since roads constitute the largest share of the total impermeable surfaces of a development, the difficulty is compounded by the grid type of layout. For these reasons modern planners have attempted to modify the rigid, uniform, classic grid.

Some cities, notably Seattle, have devised means to improve a street&#x27;s retention capacity. However, frequent intersections as they occur in a regular grid would pose an obstacle to their effective application.

A street network pattern can affect the production of pollutants by the amount of car travel that it necessitates and the speed at which cars can travel. The grid plan with its frequent intersections may displace a portion of the local car trips with walking or biking due to the directness of route that it offers to pedestrians. But, as long as cars are also allowed on those streets, it makes the same routes more direct for cars, which could be an enticement for driving. The potential car trip displacement would result in a reduction of pollutant emissions. The advantage of the intersection density for pedestrians, however, can have a contrary effect for cars due to its potential for reducing speeds. Low speeds below have a significantly higher coefficient of pollutant production than above , though the coefficient after leveling off tends to increase gradually after . This effect is accentuated with high traffic density in areas with commercial uses where speeds come to a crawl. Since the grid plan is non-hierarchical and intersections are frequent, all streets can be subject to this potential reduction of average speeds, leading to a high production of pollutants. Greenhouse and noxious gases can be detrimental to the environment and to resident health.

===Social environment and security===

In his seminal 1982 study on livable streets that was conducted in neighbourhoods with a grid, Donald Appleyard showed that social networking and street playing degraded as traffic increased on a street. His research provided the groundwork for traffic calming and for several initiatives such as living streets and Home Zones, all of which are aimed at improving a street&#x27;s social milieu. The amount of traffic on a street depends on variables such as the population density of the neighbourhood, car ownership and its proximity to commercial, institutional or recreational edifices. Most importantly, however, it depends on whether a street is or could become a through road to a destination. As a through road, it could sustain unpredictable levels of traffic that may fluctuate during the day and increase over time.

A key characteristic of the grid pattern is that any and all streets are equally accessible to traffic (non-hierarchical) and could be chosen at will as alternative routes to a destination. Cut-through driving, or shortcutting, has been resisted by residents. Cities responded by making modifications to prevent it. Current recommended design practice suggests the use of 3-way intersections to alleviate it.

The geometry of the normal, open grid is evidently unsuitable for protecting or enhancing the social environment of a street from the negative influence of traffic. Similarly, a 1972 ground-breaking study by Oscar Newman on a Defensible Space Theory described ways to improve the social environment and security of neighbourhoods and streets. In a practical application of his theory at Five Oaks, the neighbourhood&#x27;s grid pattern was modified to prevent through traffic and create identifiable smaller enclaves while maintaining complete pedestrian freedom of movement. The positive outcome of these changes reinforces Appleyard&#x27;s findings and the need to reduce or prevent through traffic on neighbourhood streets; a need that cannot be met with a typical, uniform, open grid.

The question of neighbourhood security has been a constant focus of research since Oscar Newman&#x27;s work. New research has expanded the discussion on this disputed issue. A recent study did extensive spatial analysis and correlated several building, site plan and social factors with crime frequencies and identified subtle nuances to the contrasting positions. The study looked at, among others, dwelling types, unit density (site density) movement on the street, culs–de-sac or grids and the permeability of a residential area. Among its conclusions are, respectively, that flats are always safer than houses and the wealth of inhabitants matters, density is generally beneficial but more so at ground level, local movement is beneficial, but not larger scale movement, relative affluence and the number of neighbours have a greater effect than either being on a cul-de-sac or being on a through street. It also re-established that simple, linear cul-de-sac with good numbers of dwellings that are joined to through streets tend to be safe. As for permeability, it suggests that residential areas should be permeable enough to allow movement in all directions but no more. The overprovision of poorly used permeability is a crime hazard. The open, uniform grid could be seen as an example of undifferentiated permeability.

A recent study in California examined the amount of child play that occurred on the streets of neighbourhoods with different characteristics; grid pattern and culs-de-sac. The findings indicate that the open grid streets showed substantially lower play activity than the cul-de-sac street type. Culs-de-sac reduce perceived danger from traffic, and thereby encourage more outdoor play. It pointed the way toward the development of hybrid street network patterns that improve pedestrian movement but restrict cut-through driving. Similar studies in Europe and most recently in Australia found that children&#x27;s outdoor play is significantly reduced on through roads where traffic is, or perceived by parents to be, a risk. As a result of this misperception of risk, children living in cul-de-sac communities are more likely to be killed by vehicles. This increased risk of death is due to multiple factors, including the families driving longer distances to reach their destinations, parents spending less time teaching their children to be as wary of traffic, and an increased risk of the parents accidentally driving over the children in their &quot;safe&quot; driveways and cul-de-sac streets.

Traditional street functions such as kids&#x27; play, strolling and socializing are incompatible with traffic flow, which the open, uniform grid geometry encourages. For these reasons, cities such as Berkeley, California, and Vancouver, British Columbia, among many others, transformed existing residential streets part of a grid plan into permeable, linked culs-de-sac. This transformation retains the permeability and connectivity of the grid for the active modes of transport but filters and restricts car traffic on the cul-de-sac street to residents only.

===Pedestrian and bicycle movement===

Street networks of old cities that grew organically, though admired for being picturesque, can be confusing for visitors but rarely for the original inhabitants (see plan). Similarly confusing to visitors are the plans of modern subdivisions with discontinuous and curvilinear streets. Change of street orientation, particularly when gradual or arbitrary, cannot be &quot;mapped&quot; in the mind. Impasses, crescents or cul-de-sacs frustrate the traveler especially when they are long, forcing an arduous retracing of steps.

Frequency of intersections, however, becomes also a disadvantage for pedestrians and bicycles. It disrupts the relaxed canter of walking and forces pedestrians repeatedly onto the road, a hostile, anxiety-generating territory. People with physical limitations or frailties, children and seniors for example, can find a regular walk challenging. For bicycles this disadvantage is accentuated as their normal speed is at least double that of pedestrians. Frequent stops negate the speed advantage and the physical benefit of bicycling and add to frustration. Intersections are not only unpleasant but also dangerous. Most traffic collisions and injuries occur at intersections and the majority of the injuries to pedestrians crossing &quot;with&quot; the right of way.

A dilemma arises from trying to meet important planning objectives when using the grid: pedestrianism, cost efficiency and environmental responsiveness. To serve pedestrians well, a rectangular configuration and high frequency of streets and intersections is the preferred route, which the orthogonal grid geometry provides. To reduce development costs and environmental impact, lower frequency of streets is the logical path. Since these two design objectives are contradictory a balance needs to be struck. Such balance has been achieved in leading modern projects such as Vauban, Freiburg and Village Homes, Davis. Both score high in pedestrian and bike mode share and, at the same time, in reducing negative development externalities. Their layout configurations represent a fusion of the classic grid plan with recent street network patterns.

Examining the issue of walkability, a recent comparison of seven neighbourhood layouts found a 43 and 32 percent increase in walking with respect to a grid plan and conventional suburban layout in a fused grid layout, which has greater permeability for pedestrians than for cars due to its inclusion of dedicated pedestrian paths. It also showed a 7 to 10 percent range of reduction in driving with respect to the remainder six neighbourhood layouts in the set, an environmental benefit.

===Safety===
Perceived and actual safety play a role in the use of the street. Perceived safety, though perhaps an inaccurate reflection of the number of injuries or fatalities, influences parents&#x27; decision to allow their children to play, walk or bike on the street. Actual levels of safety as measured by the total number of collisions and the number and severity of injuries are a matter of public concern. Both should inform the layout, if the street network is to achieve its optimum use.

Recent studies have found higher traffic fatality rates in outlying suburban areas than in central cities and inner suburbs with smaller blocks and more-connected street patterns.

An earlier study found significant differences in recorded accidents between residential neighborhoods that were laid out on a grid and those that included culs-de-sac and crescents. The frequency of accidents was significantly higher in the grid neighborhoods.

Two newer studies examined the frequency of collisions in two regional districts using the latest analytical tools. They investigated the potential correlation between street network patterns and frequency of collisions. In one study, cul-de-sac networks appeared to be much safer than grid networks, by nearly three to one.
A second study found the grid plan to be the least safe by a significant margin with respect to all other street patterns.

A 2009 study suggests that land use patterns play a significant role in traffic safety and should be considered in conjunction with the network pattern. While all intersection types in general reduce the incidence of fatal crashes, four-way intersections, which occur regularly in a grid, increase total and injurious crashes significantly. The study recommends hybrid street networks with dense concentrations of T-intersections and concludes that a return to the 19th century gridiron is undesirable.

Stringent adherence to the grid plan can cause steep inclines since the topology of the land is not taken into account. This may be unsafe for drivers, pedestrians and bicycles since it is more difficult to control speed and braking, particularly in winter conditions.

===Reconstruction and development===
One of the greatest difficulties with grid plans is their lack of specialization, most of the important amenities being concentrated along the city&#x27;s main arteries. Often grid plans are found in linear settlements, with a main street connecting between the perpendicular roads. However, this can be mitigated by allowing mixed use development so that destinations become closer to home. Many cities, especially in Latin America, still successfully retain their grid plans. Recently, planners in the United States and Canada have revisited the idea of reintroducing grid patterns to many cities and towns.

Dent was originally known as Challensville in the 19th century, named for the local minister Rev. James Challenge. A post office called Challensville was established in 1843, the name was changed to Dent in 1846 at the urging of local resident and then-state representative Charles Reemelin.

The Dent post office closed in 1904. The present name &quot;Dent&quot; is after its setting in a valley (or dent).

<doc id="129344" wikidata="Q2328852" url="?curid=129344" title="Finneytown, Ohio">
<text>Finneytown is a census-designated place (CDP) in Springfield Township, Hamilton County, in southwest Ohio, United States, just north of Cincinnati. The population was 12,399 at the 2020 census. Finneytown is home to the second largest private school in Ohio (St. Xavier High School) and the Cincinnati area&#x27;s annual Greek Festival (at Holy Trinity-St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church).

Finneytown is named for Ebenezer Ward Finney, a Revolutionary War soldier whose burial site is located just south of the current township. The land was originally purchased from John Cleves Symmes by Rev. Ebenezer Ward, and given to his grandson Ebenezer Ward Finney.

==History==
===Founding===
In April 1795, an old preacher named Reverend Ebenezer Ward bought the section of land which included modern day Finneytown from John Cleves Symmes. Ebenezer Ward became ill and wrote a will which designated the land to be inherited by his grandson, Ebenezer Ward Finney (born 1755). At the time the 41-year-old Finney was living in Rensselaer County, New York and had served in the 4th New York Regiment during the American Revolutionary War. Once he learned about his inheritance of Rev. Ward&#x27;s land, Finney traveled to Finneytown to inspect the land. Finneytown at the time was sparsely populated and had one trail that went East-West, known at the time as The North Bend to Carthage Trace (modern day Northbend Road) and an Indian trail that went North-South. Finney sold his old farm and moved into Finneytown with his family in 1800. He set up his farmstead on a hilltop location near the North Bend road and the road to Winton&#x27;s Plantation, and he also donated a plot of his land for a small church. Ebenezer Ward Finney died in 1822 at the age of 67. One of the original pioneers, Samuel Raymond, moved to Finney&#x27;s land and built a blacksmith shop, which remained until the 20th century.

===Suburbanization===
In the 20th century, Finneytown experienced growth as it transitioned from a rural area to a suburb. 1905 saw the founding of Special District School #10 to meet the demand for education, which was finished in 1915. Additionally, the early 20th century saw the introduction of automobiles to Finneytown, which resulted in the paving of the area&#x27;s dirt roads. Winton Road, one of the area&#x27;s main streets, was among the first to be paved in 1926.
After the Second World War, Finneytown saw a population boom as the school age population increased by 368% between 1948 and 1958. Farms were replaced by suburban housing and shopping centers. This population growth occurred at the same time a requirement for K-12 programs was introduced, which led to the founding of the Finneytown Secondary Campus in 1958. This was followed by the construction of Cottonwood Elementary in 1962 and Brent Elementary in 1964. In 2010, Cottonwood Elementary was demolished due to the difficulty of maintenance, and a new elementary school, Finneytown Elementary, was built in 2022 to replace Brent.

<text>Forest Park is the second most populous city in Hamilton County, Ohio, United States. It is a suburb of Cincinnati. The population was 20,189 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The City of Forest Park, Ohio was founded in 1956, two years after private developers Marvin Warner and Joseph Kanter purchased 3,400 acres of 5,930 acres north of Cincinnati originally set aside in 1935 by the Resettlement Administration under President Franklin D. Roosevelt to relocate struggling urban and rural families to one of three such communities planned by the government called Greenbelt towns.

The Greenbelt concept was abandoned in 1949 and the as yet undeveloped acreage of Greenhills, Ohio, which had opened in 1938, became available for purchase by the Warner-Kanter Corporation in 1954. After two years of planning they opened homes for purchase in the first residential area of Forest Park, the C section, in March 1956.

After growing to a population of 4800 in 1960 and incorporation as a village in 1961, then achieving city status in 1968, Forest Park intentionally became an “open city,” regularly adopting and passing resolutions and ordinances welcoming citizens regardless of race, creed or national origin, a policy intended to maintain the city&#x27;s commitment to diversity.

Toward this end, in 1978, the Forest Park Housing Commission created “A Comprehensive Strategy for Maintaining Diversity in Forest Park, “to combat discriminatory practices by realtors, builders and corporations.”

After a 1980 lawsuit filed by the city against a builder was dismissed for insufficient evidence, the Forest Park council issued a statement declaring that “people have the right to choose where to live, work or play based on their own free choice. That right must be secured for all people and never be artificially restricted.”

The Quality of Integrated Life resolution of 1982 would serve as a guide to integrated living, reinforcing the long-held view that diversity was a strength of Forest Park as the city moved toward a new century. In 1991 this view was reinforced when a Quality of Life Task Force issued a vision statement reflecting the “shared values of a multicultural citizenry.”

<text>Harrison is a city in western Hamilton County, Ohio, United States. The population was 12,563 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Cincinnati metropolitan area.

==History==
Harrison was laid out in 1810, named in honor of William Henry Harrison, a decorated general and state legislator and afterward the ninth president of the United States. It was incorporated in 1850 and became a city in 1981.

Harrison Township was established in 1853, formerly part of Crosby and Whitewater Township. Among the historic sites in the city&#x27;s vicinity is the Eighteen Mile House, which was built during the earliest years of the nineteenth century.

Harrison was the home of Ohio&#x27;s fifth governor Othneil Looker. It was one of the few stops in Ohio on the Whitewater Canal, built between 1836 and 1847, which spanned a distance of .

On July 13, 1863, Morgan&#x27;s Raiders, a Confederate cavalry force, invaded. The column passed through taking fresh horses and burning the bridge over the Whitewater River near the southwest part of the town. The first train came to Harrison Township in 1864. In 1882 Harrison Depot was built at West Broadway and Railroad Avenue. It later burned to the ground.

Harrison Village Park is the final resting place for a small number of veterans of the Revolutionary War. In the center of the park is a bandstand, built in the early 1930s on the site of a fountain that had been drained and filled in. It seems many children came down with cases of impetigo after spending a hot summer swimming in the fountain full of untreated water.

In 1940 the dog track in West Harrison closed due to pressure from the horse racing circuit. Monkeys in silk jackets had been used as jockeys for the dogs. The track had originally opened in 1932, when parimutuel betting was illegal in Indiana. However, during the Depression, heads were turned as the track attracted revenue to the area and was one of the highest paying local jobs at $12 a week.

Parts of the city were devastated on June 2, 1990, by an F4 tornado, but were quickly rebuilt.

Harrison is home to the headquarters of the American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute.

Since 2023, Harrison has a city partnership with Meckesheim in Germany.

==Geography==
Harrison is located in northwestern Hamilton County and is bordered to the west by the town of West Harrison, Indiana.

Interstate 74 passes through the city, east of the downtown area, with access from Exits 1 and 3. I-74 leads southeast to Cincinnati and northwest to Indianapolis.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Harrison has a total area of , of which are land and are water.

Harrison is adjacent to Miami Whitewater Forest, the second park to join the Hamilton County Park District in 1949. It now spans .

<text>Lincoln Heights is a village in Hamilton County, Ohio, United States. The population was 3,144 at the 2020 census. It is a suburb of Cincinnati.

==History==
Lincoln Heights was founded in the 1920s by property developers as a suburban enclave for black homeowners working in nearby industries. It was originally an unincorporated area which had no fire, police, streetlights, or paved roads. At the time, only some houses had electricity. Many black families bought houses in the community because zoning laws and redlining prevented them from purchasing property in other communities.

===Incorporation attempts===
The first attempt at incorporation came in 1939; the motive was so residents could establish their own municipal services. Lockland residents objected to the Lincoln Heights incorporation proposal because they feared Lincoln Heights&#x27; business district may compete with its own, so they filed an objection several minutes before the filing deadline occurred. This was the start of a series of delays.

Kitty Morgan of &quot;Cincinnati Magazine&quot; wrote that the Hamilton County and state governments were &quot;unsympathetic&quot; to the attempted incorporation. The manager of the Wright Aeronautical Plant, located on land that Lincoln Heights residents wished to incorporate, also filed an objection because he did not want the factory to be in a majority black municipality. The communities of Woodlawn, and then Evendale incorporated even though Lincoln Heights&#x27; application kept being delayed. They respectively took the western and eastern portions of territory that was supposed to be in Lincoln Heights, the latter of which contained the aeronautical plant (now the GE Aviation Evendale plant). The persons trying to establish Lincoln Heights failed to successfully challenge the Evendale incorporation in court.

Voters narrowly approved the incorporation of Lincoln Heights in a special election on June 18, 1941. At the time, African Americans made up 98% of the community&#x27;s residents. In 1946, Hamilton County allowed Lincoln Heights to incorporate with 10% of the original proposal&#x27;s area. It had no industrial tax base since there were no major factories or plants within the city limits. A University of Buffalo professor of urban and regional planning who wrote a dissertation on Lincoln Heights, Henry Louis Taylor, stated that this made Lincoln Heights vulnerable to future economic problems. 

===Subsequent history===
Morgan wrote that the &quot;halcyon days&quot; of Lincoln Heights were the post-World War II period through the 1960s. At that time of incorporation it was the only black municipality north of the Mason-Dixon line, prompting Governor of New York Thomas E. Dewey to establish a tour of Lincoln Heights, inviting New York City residents to participate. In the mid-20th century many Lincoln Heights residents worked at the Wright Aeronautical Plant and a nearby chemical plant.

In the 1970s Lincoln Heights had 6,099 residents. In the 1970s and 1980s many factories began to close, and the tax base of the city decreased, making it difficult to establish community programs. It became difficult for residents find employment, and many residents who attended universities never returned to the city. By 1990 the number of residents in Lincoln Heights had decreased to 4,805. This further declined to 4,113 persons in 2000. In 2000 &quot;Cincinnati Magazine&quot; ranked Lincoln Heights in last place, #84, in its &quot;The Best Places to Live,&quot; a ranking of communities in the Cincinnati area.

As of 2001 the community still included many longtime residents; many persons who stayed in the city had been unable to leave Lincoln Heights. That year the Lincoln Heights economic development director, Claude Audley, stated that he received telephone calls from people expressing a wish to move back to Lincoln Heights.

From 2007 to 2013 the values of houses in Lincoln Heights declined by 76.4%. During the same period the housing values in nearby Indian Hill increased by 27.7%.

In 2013 the population was down to 3,367. From 1970 to 2013, therefore, the population had declined by 45%. The population in nearby Blue Ash had increased by 46% during that time frame.

===2025 neo-Nazi demonstrations===
In February 2025, about a dozen neo-Nazis waving flags with swastikas, some also armed, gathered at a highway overpass on the border between Lincoln Heights and Evendale, Ohio. The group pinned swastika banners and a sign that read &quot;America is for the White Man&quot; on the overpass, and at one point yelled out the n-word towards a passing white driver who filmed them. Local residents of the mostly-black Lincoln Heights confronted the neo-Nazi group and within minutes the latter fled in a U-Haul truck while local police stood between them and members of the community. Residents reported that the neo-Nazis used anti-black racial slurs and criticized police for not preventing the incident and not tracking or detaining the instigators, perceiving bias in police treatment and protection of the neo-Nazis. Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval released a statement condemning the incident and said it was &quot;shocking and disgusting to see swastikas displayed in Evendale today.&quot; In the following days, counterdemonstrations and vigils were held, with hundreds of locals participating. Some residents also formed armed patrols of the neighborhood.

In 2012 the school district considered closing the school due to issues with its budget, but the school remained open after a tax levy was passed. Due to violence occurring outside of the school, it was held in an all-day lockdown from May 14 to June 2, 2014. The school district stated that this was due to concern over the safety of the students.

As of 2014, there were fewer than 200 students at Lincoln Heights Elementary, while 40 other elementary-aged children who live in Lincoln Heights attend other schools in the Princeton school district.

<text>Lockland is a village in Hamilton County, Ohio, United States. The population was 3,514 at the 2020 United States Census. Lockland is located in southwest Ohio, north of Cincinnati.

==History==
The birth of the town, and its name, are related to the first set of lock gates on the Miami and Erie Canal north of Cincinnati. The canal served as a major transportation route linking commerce from as far as New Orleans to New York City. Industry was attracted to the western Ohio area by the idea of connecting Lake Erie to the Ohio River. 

Lockland provided an abundance of water power with its difference in water levels, allowing for a water-powered gristmill. A large reservoir pond allowed boats to dock for repairs or layover. 

A proliferation of railways during the latter part of the nineteenth century across the area gradually reduced the waterway&#x27;s usefulness, and the canal operation was officially halted in 1929. The canal sat still for a few years during the thirties. The Mill Creek Expressway reused some portions of the canal&#x27;s right-of-way as well as the Wright-Lockland Highway. The National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956 created today&#x27;s interstate system, including Interstate 75 along the Mill Creek Expressway.

Lockland was home to the Stearns and Foster Mattress company, which was founded in Cincinnati in 1846 and moved to Lockland in 1880. The original factory and office building still stand in the downtown area of the village. However, after a fire in 2004 the two factory buildings, which sit on approximately , began to be demolished. By 2015 demolition was complete, including removal of the smokestack on March 26.

<text>Mariemont (pronounced ) is a village in eastern Hamilton County, Ohio, United States. The population was 3,518 at the 2020 census. A planned community in the Cincinnati metropolitan area, it includes two overlapping historic districts, the Village of Mariemont and Mariemont Historic District. In 2007, the Village of Mariemont was designated a National Historic Landmark. 

==History==

Madisonville site, the remains of a Fort Ancient village abandoned before Europeans settled in the area in 1786, is located nearby. There is also a pioneer cemetery adjacent to the Mariemont Community Church.

Mariemont was founded by Mary Emery and planned by John Nolen and 25 leading American architects. Emery and other dignitaries broke ground on April 23, 1923. Emery had spent around seven million dollars of her own money to purchase the land that would become Mariemont. Her vision was of a planned community reminiscent of an English garden city that would welcome people of differing economic backgrounds, with a mix of single-family homes and affordable low-rise apartments.

However, the dream of welcoming all classes was not achieved in the end. Construction costs drove rents up considerably higher than those in the city that Emery had hoped to help others escape. Like other planned communities founded before 1960, Mariemont was originally an exclusively white community. Homeownership in Mariemont came with deed restrictions, including restrictions on occupants. “No lot shall be sold, conveyed, rented, leased or mortgaged to or occupied, except as a house servant, by a person of African or Asiatic descent.” 

In 2008, owing to its &quot;unique character, compact and walkable design, and strong citizen participation and engagement&quot;, the American Planning Association designated Mariemont a &quot;Great Neighbourhood&quot;.

<text>Montgomery is a city in Hamilton County, Ohio, United States. It is an eastern suburb of Cincinnati. The population was 10,853 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Settled in 1795, Montgomery is one of the oldest settlements in Hamilton County. A log cabin was the first tavern of the community; this was a resting place for teamsters and travelers on the main road. In 1802, Nathaniel Terwilliger laid out the town. In 1806 and 1807 a number of people from Montgomery, New York, settled around this point for trade and farming, and named the village for their former home.

Montgomery incorporated as a village in 1910. The village became a coach stop on the Cincinnati–Zanesville Road, later known as the Montgomery Pike, with an inn, two taverns, a grist mill and a carding mill to process its agricultural products. It remained a small community until the 1960s when it became a bedroom community for people working in Cincinnati. In 1971, it was reincorporated as a city. Originally confined to the Sycamore Township limits, Montgomery began annexing land in neighboring Symmes Township in 1973. On January 1, 1986, Montgomery withdrew from Symmes Township by forming a paper township named Montgomery Township. On January 1, 1990, Montgomery also withdrew from Sycamore Township by making this paper township coextensive with the city.

During the COVID-19 pandemic Montgomery held a &quot;reverse parade&quot;, setting up floats in Sycamore High School&#x27;s parking lot and having residents drive by. The event made international news.

<text>Rain Man is a 1988 American road comedy-drama film directed by Barry Levinson and written by Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass. It tells the story of abrasive and selfish Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise), who discovers that his estranged father has died and bequeathed his multimillion-dollar estate to his other son, Raymond (Dustin Hoffman), an autistic savant whose existence Charlie was unaware of. Morrow created the character of Raymond after meeting real-life savant Kim Peek; his characterization was based on both Peek and Bill Sackter, a good friend of Morrow who was the subject of &quot;Bill&quot;, an earlier film that Morrow wrote.

&quot;Rain Man&quot; competed at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the highest prize: the Golden Bear. The film was released theatrically by MGM/UA Communications Co. under the United Artists label in the United States on December 16, 1988, to critical and commercial success. Praise was given to Levinson&#x27;s direction, the performances (particularly Cruise and Hoffman), the screenplay, the musical score, the cinematography, and the film&#x27;s portrayal of autism. The film grossed $354million on a $25 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1988, and received a leading eight nominations at the 61st Academy Awards, winning four (more than any other film nominated): Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (for Hoffman), and Best Original Screenplay.

, &quot;Rain Man&quot; is the only film to win both the Berlin International Film Festival&#x27;s highest award and the Academy Award for Best Picture in the same year. It was also the last film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) to be nominated for Best Picture until &quot;Licorice Pizza&quot; in 2021 — 33 years later.

==Plot==

Arrogant collectibles dealer Charlie Babbitt is in the middle of importing four grey market Lamborghinis to Los Angeles for resale. He needs to deliver the cars to impatient buyers who have already made down payments to repay the loan he took out to buy them, but the EPA is holding the cars at the port because they have failed emission tests. Charlie directs an employee to lie to the buyers while he stalls his creditor.

When Charlie learns that his estranged father Sanford Babbitt has died, he and his girlfriend Susanna travel to Cincinnati to settle the estate. He inherits only a group of rosebushes and a classic 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible over which he and Sanford had clashed, while the remainder of the $3 million estate is going to an unnamed trustee. He learns that the money is being directed to a local mental institution, where he meets his elder brother Raymond, of whom he was unaware.

Raymond is an autistic savant and adheres to strict routines. He has superb recall, but he shows little emotional expression, except when in distress. Charlie spirits Raymond out of the mental institution and into a hotel for the night. Disheartened with the way Charlie treats Raymond, Susanna leaves him. Charlie asks Raymond&#x27;s doctor, Dr. Gerald Bruner, for half the estate in exchange for Raymond&#x27;s return, but Bruner refuses. Charlie decides to attempt to gain custody of his brother to get control of the money.

After Raymond refuses to fly to Los Angeles, he and Charlie resort to driving there instead. They make slow progress because Raymond insists on sticking to his routines, which include watching &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; on television every day, getting to bed by 11:00 p.m., and refusing to travel when it rains. He also objects to traveling on the Interstate after they encounter a car accident.

During the course of the journey, Charlie learns more about Raymond, including his ability to instantly perform complex calculations and count hundreds of objects at once, far beyond the normal range of human abilities. He also realizes that Raymond had lived with the family as a child and was the &quot;Rain Man&quot; (Charlie&#x27;s infantile pronunciation of &quot;Raymond&quot;), a comforting figure Charlie had remembered as an imaginary friend. Raymond had saved an infant Charlie from being scalded by hot bathwater one day, but Sanford blamed Raymond for nearly injuring Charlie, and committed him to the institution, as he was unable to speak up for himself and correct the misunderstanding.

Charlie&#x27;s creditor repossesses the Lamborghinis, forcing him to refund his buyers&#x27; down payments and leaving him deeply in debt. Having passed Las Vegas, he and Raymond return to Caesars Palace and devise a plan to win the needed money by playing blackjack and counting cards. Although the casino bosses obtain videotape evidence of the scheme and ask them to leave, Charlie successfully wins $86,000 to cover his debts. He also reconciles with Susanna, who has rejoined the brothers in Las Vegas.

Returning to Los Angeles, Charlie meets with Bruner, who offers him $250,000 to walk away from Raymond. Charlie refuses, saying he is no longer upset about being cut out of his father&#x27;s will, but he wants to have a relationship with his brother. At a meeting with a court-appointed psychiatrist, Raymond proves to be unable to decide for himself what he wants. Charlie stops the questioning and tells Raymond he is happy to have him as his brother. As Raymond and Bruner board a train to return to the institution, Charlie promises to visit in two weeks.

===Development===

In drafting the story for &quot;Rain Man&quot;, Barry Morrow decided to base Raymond Babbitt on his experiences with both Kim Peek and Bill Sackter, two men who had gained notoriety and fame for their intellectual disabilities and, in Peek&#x27;s case, for his abilities as a savant that were evident in high speed reading and extremely detailed memory. Prior to the conception of &quot;Rain Man&quot;, Morrow had formed a friendship with the intellectually disabled Sackter, and, in doing so, ended up taking some situational aspects from his friendship and using them to help craft the relationship between Charlie and Raymond. Following the success of &quot;Bill&quot;, the made-for-TV movie he had written about Sackter, Morrow met Kim Peek and was wildly intrigued by his savant syndrome. Going into the creation of the film, Morrow was still essentially unaware of the intricacies of the condition, as well as of autism itself; instead deciding that the movie was less about Raymond&#x27;s intellectual disability, and more about the relationship formed between Raymond and Charlie.

Roger Birnbaum was the first studio executive to give the film a green light; he did so immediately after Barry Morrow pitched the story. Birnbaum received &quot;special thanks&quot; in the film&#x27;s credits.

Real-life brothers Dennis and Randy Quaid were considered for the roles of Raymond Babbitt and Charles Babbitt. Agents at Creative Artists Agency sent the script to Dustin Hoffman and Bill Murray, envisioning Murray in the title role, and Hoffman in the role eventually portrayed by Tom Cruise. Martin Brest, Steven Spielberg and Sydney Pollack were directors also involved in the film. Spielberg was attached to the film for five months, until he left to direct &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, and he would later regret the decision. Mickey Rourke was also offered a role, but he turned it down. Mel Gibson was also offered the role of Raymond, but he turned it down.

For a year prior to playing Raymond Babbitt, Hoffman prepared to portray Raymond&#x27;s autism by seeking out and educating himself on other autistic people, particularly those with savant syndrome. Hoffman had some experience with disabled individuals prior to filming, having worked at the New York Psychiatric Institute when he was younger. Inspiration for the portrayal of Raymond Babbitt&#x27;s mannerisms was drawn from a multitude of sources, but he thanked three men in his Oscar acceptance speech. One was Peter Guthrie, the autistic brother of Kevin Guthrie, a Princeton football player with whom Hoffman was in touch at the time. Another was autistic savant Joseph Sullivan, who was the subject of two documentary films and whose mother, Dr. Ruth Sullivan, was the founding president of the Autism Society of America and served as a consultant on the film. The third was savant Kim Peek, with whom Hoffman met as part of his research of the role, wherein he would observe and mimic Peek&#x27;s actions, attempting to give an accurate portrayal of what an individual with savant syndrome might act like. His mimicry of Peek&#x27;s savant syndrome was deemed a poor fit for the character by Hoffman, resulting in Hoffman&#x27;s decision to make Babbitt not only a man with savant syndrome, but also with autism.

===Filming===
Principal photography included nine weeks of filming on location in Cincinnati and throughout northern Kentucky. Other portions were shot in the desert near Palm Springs, California. There was originally a different ending to the movie drafted by Morrow that differed from Raymond&#x27;s going back to the institution. Morrow ultimately decided to drop this ending in favor of Raymond&#x27;s returning to the institution, as he felt the original ending would not have stuck with the viewers as effectively as the revised ending did. Almost all of the principal photography occurred during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike; one key scene that was affected by the lack of writers was the film&#x27;s final scene. Bass delivered his last draft of the script only hours before the strike started and spent no time on the set.

==Box office==
&quot;Rain Man&quot; debuted December 16, 1988, and was the second highest-grossing film at the weekend box office (behind &quot;Twins&quot;), with $7million. It reached the first spot the weekend of December 30 – January 2, finishing 1988 with $42million. The film would become the highest-grossing U.S. film of 1988 by earning more than $172million. Worldwide figures vary, though. Box Office Mojo claims that the film grossed over $354million worldwide, while The Numbers reported that the film grossed $412.8million worldwide.

==Reception==
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Rain Man&quot; holds an approval rating of 88%, based on 136 reviews, with an average rating of 8.10/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;This road-trip movie about an autistic savant and his callow brother is far from seamless, but Barry Levinson&#x27;s direction is impressive, and strong performances from Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman add to its appeal.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot;, on a scale of A+ to F.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;Rain Man&quot;: Canby considered the &quot;film&#x27;s true central character&quot; to be &quot;the confused, economically and emotionally desperate Charlie, beautifully played by Mr. Cruise.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four. He wrote: Gene Siskel also gave the film three and a half stars out of four, singling out Cruise for praise: &quot;The strength of the film is really that of Cruise&#x27;s performance...the combination of two superior performances makes the movie worth watching.&quot;

Amy Dawes of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;one of the year&#x27;s most intriguing film premises ... is given uneven, slightly off-target treatment&quot;; she called the road scenes &quot;hastily, loosely written, with much extraneous screen time&quot;, but admired the last third of the film, calling it a depiction of &quot;two very isolated beings&quot; who &quot;discover a common history and deep attachment&quot;.

One of the film&#x27;s harshest reviews came from &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine critic Pauline Kael, who said, &quot;Everything in this movie is fudged ever so humanistically, in a perfunctory, low-pressure way. And the picture has its effectiveness: people are crying at it. Of course they&#x27;re crying at it—it&#x27;s a piece of wet kitsch.&quot;

&quot;Rain Man&quot; was placed on 39 critics&#x27; &quot;ten best&quot; lists in 1988, based on a poll of the nation&#x27;s top 100 critics.

===Accolades===
== Legacy ==
The release of &quot;Rain Man&quot; in 1988 coincided with a tenfold increase in funding for medical research and diagnoses of individuals for autism. The latter is primarily due to autism&#x27;s being more broadly defined in newer editions of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;, particularly versions III-R and IV. The movie is credited, however, with significantly increasing awareness of autism among the general public.

&quot;Rain Man&quot; is known, in particular, for its portrayal of a man with both autism and savant skills, leading much of its viewing audience to incorrectly assume the intellectual capabilities of autistic people at large. Characters like Raymond Babbitt, whose characterization has been criticized for adhering to stereotypes, are portrayed as having an otherworldly intellectual ability that, rather than disable them from living a &quot;normal&quot; life, instead assists them in a nearly magical way. Although having savant abilities is certainly a possibility for autistic individuals, the combination is incredibly rare. Conversely, &quot;Rain Man&quot; has also been seen as dispelling a number of other misconceptions about autism, and improving public awareness of the failure of many agencies to accommodate autistic people and make use of the abilities they do have, regardless of whether they have savant skills or not.

Since Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s 1989 Academy Award win for his performance in &quot;Rain Man&quot;, about half of all Best Actor trophies have been awarded for portrayals of characters who are disabled in some way; none of these recipients share their characters&#x27; disabilities in real life. Just one year after Hoffman&#x27;s win, Daniel Day-Lewis (thus far the only actor to have won three awards in the category) garnered his first Best Actor win for his portrayal of cerebral palsy patient Christy Brown in &quot;My Left Foot&quot;. The Academy&#x27;s incentivizing of such casting practices has drawn criticism from disabled actors and self-advocates, who argue that these decisions sideline more authentic stories about disabled characters, in favor of leveraging already-established actors&#x27; prestige. This pattern has even been satirized by the 2008 film &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot; (in which Tom Cruise also appears), wherein Robert Downey Jr.&#x27;s character, Kirk Lazarus, chastises a fellow actor for portraying a character whose developmental disability is deemed too alienating for a mainstream audience.

&quot;Rain Man&quot; is also known for popularizing the misconception that card counting is illegal in the United States.

In 2006, the film was recognized by the American Film Institute in their list of 100 Years...100 Cheers at #63.

== In popular culture ==
The cold open sketch in the April 1, 1989, installment of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; spoofed both the film and the Pete Rose gambling scandal at the time. Charlie and Raymond Babbitt were played by Ben Stiller and Dana Carvey, respectively, with Phil Hartman as Rose. 

References to &quot;Rain Man&quot;, Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s performance in particular, have become a popular shorthand for autism and savantism. In the final episode of the first season of &quot;Community&quot;, Pierce calls Abed &quot;Rain Man&quot; when listing members of the study group; Abed had been described previously as having Asperger&#x27;s Syndrome, which is now diagnosed as autism spectrum disorder.

===Qantas and airline controversy===
In June 1989, at least fifteen major airlines showed edited versions of &quot;Rain Man&quot; that omitted the scene involving Raymond&#x27;s refusal to fly, mentioning the crashes of American Airlines Flight 625, Delta Air Lines Flight 191, and Continental Airlines Flight 1713, except on Australia-based Qantas. Those criticizing this decision included film director Barry Levinson, co-screenwriter Ronald Bass, and George Kirgo (at the time, the President of the Writers Guild of America, West). &quot;I think it&#x27;s a key scene to the entire movie&quot;, Levinson said in a telephone interview. &quot;That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s in there. It launches their entire odyssey across country – because they couldn&#x27;t fly.&quot; Although some of those airlines cited as justification avoiding having airplane passengers feel uncomfortable in sympathy with Raymond during the in-flight entertainment, the scene was shown intact on flights of Qantas, and commentators noted that Raymond mentions &quot;it&quot; as the only airline whose planes have &quot;never crashed&quot;.

The film is credited with introducing Qantas&#x27;s safety record to U.S. consumers. However, contrary to the claims made in the film, Qantas aircraft have been involved in a number of fatal accidents since the airline&#x27;s founding in 1920 (although none involving jet aircraft, with the last incident taking place in December 1951).

===The Buick convertible===
Two 1949 Roadmaster convertibles were used in the filming, one of which had its rear suspension stiffened to bear the additional load of camera equipment and a cameraman. After filming completed, the unmodified car was acquired by Hoffman, who had it restored and added it to his collection. He kept it for 34 years. &quot;Hemmings Motor News&quot; reported that the car was auctioned in January 2022 by Bonhams in Scottsdale, Arizona, and sold for $335,000. The camera-carrying car was similarly acquired by Barry Levinson, who had it restored by Wayne Carini of the &quot;Chasing Classic Cars&quot; television series a few years later.

<doc id="129369" wikidata="Q2375199" url="?curid=129369" title="North College Hill, Ohio">
<text>North College Hill is a city in Hamilton County in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Ohio approximately ten miles north of downtown Cincinnati. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 9,663. The city takes its name from its proximity to the Cincinnati neighborhood of College Hill (formerly Pleasant Hill) which borders it to the south.

==History==
One of the first easterners to survey the area was John Cleves Symmes, a judge and former Congressman from New Jersey, after whom Symmes Township is named. Symmes visited the area in 1787 and received tentative permission from the new Federal government to purchase a section of land between the Little Miami and Great Miami Rivers. This tract became known as the “Symmes Purchase” or “Miami Purchase” and extended south to the Ohio River.

Several of the pioneers who migrated across the midwest to claim a part of Symmes&#x27; tract are buried in North College Hill&#x27;s oldest landmark, the LaBoiteaux-Cary cemetery. Established in approximately 1806, the cemetery includes the graves of two Revolutionary War veterans and several members of the Cary family. The last burial in the cemetery was in 1860.

===Cary family===
In 1813–14, William Cary, having migrated from New Hampshire to Cincinnati in 1802, purchased north of Cincinnati along what is now Hamilton Avenue (U.S. Route 127). Cary built a log cabin and moved his family to this “wilderness,” then known as Mill Creek Township.

Soon after, William Cary purchased an additional north of North Bend Road adjacent to his original tract, and sold part of it to his nephew Robert Cary. Robert called the land Clovernook Farm and initially erected a small frame house for his family. In 1832, he built the white, brick house now known as Cary Cottage (see photo) which stands on the campus of the &quot;Clovernook Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired&quot; and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Within a year of his settlement, Robert also laid out the first community in the area, called Clovernook, on the east side of Hamilton Avenue.

Robert Cary and his wife Elizabeth raised nine children, two of whom, Alice and Phoebe, became well-known poets and writers. Both girls began having their poems published as teenagers, and they eventually counted among their admirers Massachusetts poet and abolitionist John Greenleaf Whittier, &quot;New York Tribune&quot; newspaper editor Horace Greeley, and author Edgar Allan Poe, who pronounced Alice Cary&#x27;s &quot;Pictures of Memory&quot;, &quot;one of the most musically perfect lyrics in the English language&quot;.

Cary Cottage became the first home for blind women in Ohio through the work of the Trader sisters, Florence and Georgia (who was blind). In 1903 the Cary house and the land surrounding it were purchased by William Procter, grandson of the Procter &amp; Gamble co-founder, in order to give them in trust to the Traders. The sisters used the land to establish the Clovernook home and provide employment to visually impaired women as a source of dignity and direction. Today, the &quot;Clovernook Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired&quot; offers instruction, employment, community living and low vision services for men and women, and runs three manufacturing departments, including one of the world&#x27;s largest volume producers of Braille publications.

===Religious and legal reform===
====Isaac Mayer Wise====
In the latter part of the nineteenth century, North College Hill was the home of Dr. Isaac Mayer Wise, who has been called “the most prominent Jew of his time in the United States” for his influence as one of the early leaders of Reform Judaism in America.

In 1861, Wise and his wife Therese bought a house and farm near the current intersection of Goodman and Hamilton Avenues, where they raised a family of ten children. Wise added to the original farmhouse until it included 13 rooms on various levels. The farm, meanwhile, allowed him to carry out agricultural experiments and to enjoy the opportunity to own his own land.

A park near the site of his former farm was dedicated to Wise. In 2022, the park was renovated and re-dedicated.

====Tumey v. Ohio====
In 1925, North College Hill Mayor A. R. Pugh was involved in a Prohibition case. Ohio law allowed small towns like North College Hill to operate &quot;liquor courts&quot;. These courts had authority over their entire county. Further, the Crabbe Act allowed local towns, mayors, and police departments to keep at least some of the fines imposed by these courts. In &quot;Tumey v. Ohio&quot; (1927), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Crabbe Act was unconstitutional as financial conflicts of interest impaired the right to a fair trial. The court&#x27;s decision in this case continues to provide precedent today in cases involving judicial impartiality.

===Development of a community===
Through the nineteenth century, as College Hill to the south and Mount Healthy to the north matured into towns, the area that was to become North College Hill remained largely farmland. Beginning in 1905, saw mill owner John Meyer used his surplus lumber to build a subdivision of small homes north of Galbraith Road and west of Hamilton Avenue and called it Meyerville. Within the next ten years, two other groups of homes – Clovernook, east of Hamilton Avenue, and Sunshine, south of Galbraith and west of Hamilton – were started. The three subdivisions, with a total of about 500 residents, were incorporated as the Village of North College Hill in 1916.

As the automobile stretched commuting distances, the village&#x27;s affordable housing attracted a growing population, and it increased from about 1,100 to 4,100 residents during the 1920s. In 1941, the village incorporated as a City and continued to grow until the population stabilized at its peak of around 12,000 by 1960. A few homes were removed for the completion of Ronald Reagan Cross County Highway (Ohio State Route 126) in 1997. Population has declined more or less steadily over the past four decades, according to the U.S. Census: 1970 12,363; 1980 10,990; 1990 11,002; 2000 10,082; 2010 9,397.

In 2007, &quot;Money&quot; magazine listed the city sixth among places &quot;where homes are affordable&quot;. On November 6, 2007 a ballot initiative to make North College Hill a charter city was passed by the voters. In 2011 North College Hill was rated the &quot;best place to raise kids in Ohio&quot; by &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot;, based on such factors as school performance, the number of schools, crime statistics, cost of living, job growth, air quality, ethnic diversity, and access to recreational facilities.

<text>Norwood is the third most populous city in Hamilton County, Ohio, United States, and an enclave of the larger city of Cincinnati. The population was 19,043 at the 2020 census. Originally settled as an early suburb of Cincinnati in the wooded countryside north of the city, the area is characterized by older homes and tree-lined streets.

==History==
===Early history===
The earliest humans in the area now known as Norwood are believed to have been Pre-Columbian era people of the Adena culture. Norwood Mound, a prehistoric earthwork mound built by the Adena, is located in Norwood and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Adena constructed the mound at the location of Norwood&#x27;s present-day Water Tower Park, which is the highest land elevation in the city. Archaeologists believe the mound was built at this site due to the high elevation and was used by the Adena for religious ceremonies and smoke signaling.

Native American mounds are not uncommon in Ohio and several were located in Downtown Cincinnati at the time of arrival of the first white settlers. However, by 1895, the Norwood Mound was the only remaining mound in the vicinity of Cincinnati.&quot; The mound has never been excavated, but it is reported that many artifacts found in the area by early Norwood settlers in the 1800s made up the original nucleus of the Native American Art Collection of the Cincinnati Art Museum. In the early-20th century, Norwood High School named their sports team mascot the Indians in honor of this local Native American heritage.

===Sharpsburg settlement===
In 1787, the United States Congress established the Northwest Territory, and John Cleves Symmes, Congressman from New Jersey, purchased of the territory (the Symmes Purchase), within which the future Norwood is located. One year later, the first permanent settlement on the banks of the Ohio River in what would later become Cincinnati was established. In 1793, General &quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne led several companies of troops from Fort Washington in Cincinnati to advance against a hostile tribe of Native Americans encamped on the banks of the nearby Millcreek in what is now St. Bernard. Historians believe that a company of troops under the direction of General Wayne made their way through Norwood during this campaign and widened an old Native American trail, which followed the path of present-day Smith Road, Montgomery Road, and Carthage Avenue.

In 1794, a pioneer named Peter Smith settled on Duck Creek in or near the current location of Norwood. It is believed he is one of the earliest Norwood settlers, if not the first. Soon after, a road was built connecting the early settlement of Columbia on the Ohio River near the Little Miami River with the settlement of Carthage, just north of Cincinnati. This road cut through Norwood along the old Indian Path widened by General Wayne&#x27;s troops. Anthony Wayne&#x27;s victory over the Indians at the Battle of Fallen Timbers the same year signaled the end of the Northwest Indian War which enabled pioneers to begin settling former hostile lands such as the future Norwood. In 1795, another road was built along the present-day path of Montgomery Road, connecting Cincinnati with Montgomery, Ohio and beyond. Montgomery Road was known as the &quot;State Road&quot; and Smith Road/Carthage Avenue was known as the &quot;County Road.&quot;

In 1809, a settler named Samuel D. Bowman purchased land near the crossing of the State Road and the County Road, where he established a tavern and coach stop for travelers. He was soon joined by John Sharp, who built a cabin and country store at the opposite side of the intersection. The community of half a dozen houses soon became known as &quot;Sharpsburg&quot;, after Sharp. For the next half century, the coach stop along the road between Cincinnati and Columbus remained small.

===Sharpsburg becomes Norwood===
In 1866, the first tracks of the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad were completed, connecting Loveland with Cincinnati. The tracks ran from east to west through Sharpsburg and still exist in the same location today, parallel to the Norwood Lateral Expressway and passing under the Montgomery Road overpass. The village did not initially have a train station when the railway opened, but the possibility of passenger rail access to Cincinnati generated interest in developing a residential subdivision nearby. In 1868, two early developments were platted in the area north of the railroad. The first train station was established that same year.

In 1869, Sylvester H. Parvin, Col. Philander P. Lane and Lemuel Bolles purchased the William Ferguson farm north of the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad tracks and platted an eighty-one-acre subdivision they called Norwood Heights. This was the first recorded use of the name Norwood in the area. It is commonly believed that the person who came up with the name was Sarah Bolles, wife of Lemuel Bolles. In the 1894 book, &quot;Norwood, Her Homes and Her People&quot;, it was stated that the name &quot;Sharpsburg&quot; was &quot;not considered pretty enough for such a spot, and the suggestion of the Bolles&#x27; to call it Norwood (an abbreviation of Northwood) met with endorsement, and so it was that the suburb was christened anew.&quot;

However, the origin of the name Norwood is commonly disputed. It is also stated that Mrs. Bolles&#x27;s name for the 1869 Norwood Heights subdivision was inspired by Henry Ward Beecher&#x27;s popular 1869 novel &quot;Norwood: or, Village Life in New England&quot;. Others have claimed Mrs. Bolles arrived at the name by combining &quot;North Woods&quot;, in reference to Norwood being a wooded area north of Cincinnati. In any case, the new name Norwood was popular enough that the &quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; reported in 1870 that &quot;the old town of Sharpsburg has been changed to Norwood&quot; and the Sharpsburg post office was officially renamed Norwood the same year. By 1873, a second subdivision using the Norwood name, &quot;The Heart of Norwood&quot;, was platted on 50-acres west of Montgomery Road at Maple and Elm Avenues. It was later referred to as &quot;Old Norwood&quot; after newer subdivisions using the name Norwood were built.

===Railroads and subdivisions===
Despite the initial interest in Norwood generated by the arrival of the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad, the new subdivisions were premature and failed to immediately take off. Only one home, located on the hill east of Norwood Mound, was constructed in the Norwood Heights subdivision. Norwood still remained largely farmland and orchards throughout the 1870s. Although the Marietta and Cincinnati railroad provided transportation to Cincinnati, it was via an inconvenient circuitous route which followed the Millcreek several miles out of the way to the west.

In 1875, several prominent local property owners in Norwood approached the Lebanon Narrow-gauge Railway Company (later known as the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway) to discuss building a passenger railroad between Norwood and downtown Cincinnati. The property owners offered their land to the railroad for use as free right-of-way. The railroad agreed and began to lay tracks from the northeast to southwest through Norwood and Avondale in the late-1870s.

Around the same time, construction was started on another railroad, the Cincinnati and Eastern Railway, which was built west to east along the present-day border of Norwood and Evanston. The tracks continued along Wasson Road in Hyde Park, connecting Norwood with Cincinnati&#x27;s eastern suburbs and ultimately Portsmouth, Ohio. This line merged with the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern line southwest of Norwood at Idlewild, which was the name for the area near the present day campus of Xavier University.

In 1881, the northern section of the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern opened, connecting Norwood with Lebanon. In 1882, the southern section opened, providing service from Norwood directly to the central downtown station. Later in the year, the Cincinnati and Eastern Railway opened, providing passenger service from Norwood to Hyde Park and beyond.

The arrival of the passenger railroad proved to be the catalyst for rapid population growth in Norwood, as Cincinnatians could now work downtown and commute to their homes in the suburbs. Travel time between Norwood and downtown was less than 20 minutes.

Within a few years after the opening of the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern, five train stations were constructed in Norwood along the route. These were Idlewild, Ivanhoe, Hopkins, Norwood Park, and East Norwood.

===Village of Norwood===
The 1880s in Norwood were marked by the development of several new subdivisions and municipal improvements throughout the village. The Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern railroad influenced to the construction of the subdivisions.

The first Norwood Town Hall was constructed in 1882. The hall was constructed at the demand of local residents who wanted a village center for community functions. The Norwood Town Hall Association was instrumental in leading the effort to incorporate Norwood as a village in later years.

A small Central School schoolhouse was erected in 1887 to meet the education demands of the growing village. A one-room school house for Columbia Township had existed at this location possibly as early as 1828. Just one year after construction, the 1887 school house was expanded, as the number of students enrolled had already doubled.

Norwood&#x27;s first fire brigade was organized in South Norwood in January 1888.

As the village continued to grow, the leaders of the Town Hall Association knew the only way to sustain continued civic improvements was to incorporate as a village. One of the main incentives for incorporation was to provide public street lighting. The leaders started proceedings in early-1888 and on May 14, 1888, the Village of Norwood was formally incorporated by approval of the County Commissioners of Hamilton County. The signers of the petition were almost the entire male adult population of a total census of 1,000. Three months later, the first municipal elections were held and Dr. John C. Weyer was elected the village&#x27;s first mayor.

Norwood continued to expand the boundaries of the village in 1889 by annexing land bordering the original subdivisions. The same year, work was started on a new subdivision called Elsmere. In 1891, Norwood Council annexed Elsmere as part of the village. These two annexations were the first of thirteen conducted by Norwood between 1889 and 1981.

===Streetcars and Water Works===
Around the time of Norwood&#x27;s incorporation, local leaders began pushing for an electric streetcar route on Montgomery Road to connect Norwood with downtown. Until this time, Montgomery Road (known as &quot;The Pike&quot;) was a privately owned turnpike, requiring users pay a toll to use the road. This private ownership became a sore spot for local residents who desired public streetcar transportation. With the help of the County Commissioners of Hamilton County and the State of Ohio, Norwood was able to purchase the road for public use and construction was started on an electric railway.

In mid-1891, the Norwood Electric Railway streetcar line was completed between Norwood and Walnut Hills, with the route extending to a turnaround at the Mount Adams Incline.

Increasing school enrollment resulted in the construction of two new school buildings in 1891. Williams School (later Williams Avenue Elementary) was opened in on Williams Avenue and Marion School (later North Norwood School) was opened on Marion Avenue. Both buildings were later replaced with newer structures.

Clean drinking water was one of the most important issues facing Norwood in its early days. Residents had to rely on private wells, cisterns or streams for their water. In 1892, the citizens of Norwood voted for a public &quot;water works&quot; system to be built. In 1894, the Norwood Water Works was completed, which supplied Norwood with clean water for 65 years.

In March 1894, Norwood&#x27;s first newspaper, the Norwood Enterprise, began publication. It would stay in print until 1989.

Norwood&#x27;s first high school was constructed alongside a nearly identical new elementary school building, with both opening in 1897.

===Early industry===
In 1898, the Bullock Electric Manufacturing Company relocated to Norwood, becoming one of the village&#x27;s first industrial plants, following McFarlan Lumber Company and the Cincinnati Brick Company. The plant was eventually acquired by German company, Siemens. In 1900, the Globe Wernicke Company constructed a new factory in Norwood for the manufacture of wooden bookcases. In 1901, the United States Playing Card Company moved to new facilities in Norwood.

===City of Norwood===
In 1902, the City of Cincinnati made the first of several attempts to annex Norwood. The citizens of Norwood rejected the merger by a margin of 55 votes. Later that year, Norwood citizens voted to incorporate the village as a city, since their population of 6,480 made them eligible for incorporation. This issue was decided by the same margin of 55 votes. Norwood&#x27;s first city election took place in 1903. The newly elected officials repurposed the old Village Hall as the first City Hall of the City of Norwood.

1905 was a significant year for public services in Norwood. On July 1, the city established both its fire and police departments. Later that year, the Andrew Carnegie Foundation provided funds to begin construction of Norwood&#x27;s first public library, which opened in 1907. It was the second Carnegie Library to open in the Cincinnati area. The City of Norwood transferred the property to the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County and it became a branch of that organization.

In 1908, Greek immigrants, Thomas and Nicholas Aglamesis, opened an ice cream parlor on Montgomery Road in Norwood. Five years later, they added a second store in neighboring Oakley. The Norwood store eventually closed, but their Oakley location, known as Aglamesis Bro&#x27;s, remains a popular Cincinnati institution to this day.

The same year, the United States Playing Card Company opened a new factory in Norwood. The factory would eventually grow to over 600,000 square feet of operations and become the largest manufacturer of playing cards in the world.

In 1909, Norwood officials began openly discussing the possibility of annexing neighboring Kennedy Heights. However, negotiations with Kennedy Heights officials eventually fell through and Kennedy Heights was later annexed by the City of Cincinnati.

In 1912, the Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company purchased the Standard Mill Company and changed the name to the Norwood Sash &amp; Door Company. This factory became the primary manufacturer of Sears’ prefabricated Catalog Homes. The factory was operated by Sears in Norwood until 1945.

===New high school and city hall===
Enrollment at Norwood High School continued to grow at a rapid pace and the student population eventually outgrew the first high school. In 1914, a new high school was constructed. The original high school on Allison Street was converted into an elementary school.

Norwood&#x27;s current city hall, the Norwood Municipal Building, was designed by John Scudder Adkins, who was also the architect for the Norwood Public Library building. It opened in 1916, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

The old Allison High School building to burnt down in 1917. The building was later rebuilt. The same year, a new school was also constructed to replace the original 1892 Williams Avenue school.

More than 3,000 fans attended the season opener of the 1916 World Champion Norwood baseball team at Norwood Park. Norwood Park was also used during this era for other community entertainment events.

===Industrial and infrastructure growth===
According to a survey of historical records by the WPA, there were 47 factories in operation in Norwood by 1919.

In 1920, construction started on the Cincinnati Subway in downtown Cincinnati. The original plan was for a 16-mile loop to connect downtown with Norwood. Several subway tunnels were completed in Norwood. As subway construction continued into the late-1920s, the city experienced economic hardships and eventually abandoned the project in 1928, leaving the partially finished subway abandoned.

During the early-20th century, Norwood generated its own electricity at a municipal electric facility. In 1920, Norwood sold the facility and electrical distribution system to Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Company, allowing CG&amp;E to provide electrical services to the city.

In 1922, General Motors purchased of land to construct the Norwood Assembly automobile plant. This property was previously a large community park known as Norwood Park. The Norwood Assembly Plant produced General Motors cars between 1923 and 1987. The GM plant became the dominant employer in Norwood, with nearly 9,000 workers during its peak in the 1970s. It also contributed approximately 35% of the City of Norwood&#x27;s tax base.

To promote the popularity of the card game, bridge, the United States Playing Card Company established a radio station in 1922 at their factory with the call letters WSAI. Bridge experts played the game on the air and provided instruction to listeners. In 1926, the company built a bell tower atop the main factory building. The sounds of the bells were frequently broadcast on the station. The company operated WSAI in Norwood until it was sold to Crosley Broadcasting Corporation in 1928.

In an effort to improve Duck Creek Road, Norwood encased the Duck Creek waterway in a concrete aqueduct in 1923. The creek bed was filled in and all bridges spanning the waterway were removed. Most of Duck Creek road was later eliminated with the construction of Interstate 71 in the late-1960s.

Construction of the massive $1,000,000 Mt. Saint Mary&#x27;s Seminary was completed in 1923. The seminary educated dozens of future priests, bishops, and archbishops for the Catholic Church until it closed in 1980. The seminary was purchased in 1993 and renovated over the course of years and reopened as Our Lady of the Holy Spirit Center and as a Marian Spiritual center in consonance with the Roman Catholic Church.

In 1930, the City of Norwood rezoned the city council from four to six wards, reflecting the increase in the city&#x27;s population. The six wards were rezoned back to four after the population declined in the 2000s.

===Decline of the railway===
In 1933, Norwood&#x27;s last new passenger train station was constructed. This station was opened to complement the new Cincinnati Union Terminal station downtown. The station was later closed and the renovated building is now used as a social hall.

The same year, the Cincinnati, Lebanon &amp; Northern Railroad stopped providing passenger service. Rail travel in America was on the decline at this point due to the growing usage of the automobile.

Albers Supermarket, the first supermarket in Ohio and the first grocery store in the world to call itself a supermarket, was opened in 1933 by William H. Albers on Montgomery Road in Norwood at the site of today&#x27;s Surrey Square shopping center. Albers, the former president of the Kroger Company, went on to revolutionize the grocery industry by embracing many innovations such as shopping carts, fluorescent lighting, and individual pricing on all items. The Albers chain was a success and was later acquired by Colonial Stores in 1955. The Norwood location was destroyed by a fire in 1968.

When the Ohio River flood of 1937 halted the operation of the Cincinnati Water Works, Norwood came to the aid of Cincinnati by offering drinking water from its artesian wells. Street flushing trucks were brought in from Cleveland to haul the water from Norwood to downtown.

In 1940, residents Carl H. Lindner Sr. and his children Carl Lindner Jr., Robert, Richard, and Dorothy opened the first United Dairy Farmers store in Norwood. Until this point, most people paid a premium to have milk delivered directly to their homes. United Dairy Farmers cut out the delivery middleman and sold milk at their store for nearly half the price of delivered milk. The UDF chain of stores eventually grew and helped make Carl Lindner Jr. one of the world&#x27;s richest people.

In 1948, Norwood opened a municipal parking lot at the site of the future Surrey Square shopping center. This was one of the first significant steps in the transformation of Norwood&#x27;s downtown business district, known as &quot;The Pike,&quot; from pedestrian-friendly storefronts to the Surrey Square automobile-centric strip mall.

The following year, streetcar lines in Norwood were eliminated and replaced by trolley buses, using the same overhead double electric lines.

A new Williams Avenue elementary school and administration building were constructed in 1952 next to the existing 1917 school.

Around 1959, the water table of Norwood&#x27;s artesian wells dropped to a level that became too expensive to maintain and Norwood began buying water from Cincinnati.

Ohio State Route 562, also known as the Norwood Lateral Expressway, was first completed between Interstate 75 and Reading Road in 1962. It was nicknamed the Norwood Lateral due to its close approach to Norwood, which at the time was Hamilton County&#x27;s 2nd largest municipality. For nearly two decades, the &quot;Lateral&quot; terminated at Reading Road inside Cincinnati city limits. In 1969, work began on the extension of the &quot;Lateral&quot; into Norwood proper and connection to the proposed Interstate 71. The route of I-71 would pass through Norwood&#x27;s east side. To accommodate the extension, nearly 200 homes in the old East Norwood neighborhood were razed, resulting in a loss of population and property tax revenue. Norwood was also required to share 5% of the cost of the expressway project. The full Norwood Lateral extension was completed in 1977.

At about the same time as the Norwood Lateral completion, the Globe-Wernicke Company moved operations out of Norwood to Tennessee. The factory was closed and demolished two years later.

The overhead wires used to power the trolley buses and the street cars were removed from Norwood streets in 1965. The trolley buses, which had replaced street cars in 1949, were replaced by gasoline and diesel powered buses.

===Surrey Square and decline of &quot;The Pike&quot;===
Around 1967, Norwood&#x27;s first strip mall, Norwood Plaza, opened. Business owners were concerned the strip mall would impact Norwood&#x27;s central business district.

After the Albers Supermarket was destroyed by fire in 1968, Norwood purchased the property and demolished the building as part of an urban renewal plan. This plan was centered around the construction of a new shopping center, which eventually became Surrey Square. In 1972, other businesses were demolished as an additional phase of the urban renewal plan.

To accommodate growing enrollment, Norwood constructed a new high school in 1972, adjacent to the old 1914 high school. The old high school became the middle school. The new high school included a planetarium (now known as Drake Planetarium and Science Center).

In 1975, Surrey Square Shopping Center opened in the heart of the original shopping district. Ironically, the inside of Surrey Square Mall was designed to look like a traditional small town main street, complete with fake storefronts reminiscent of the ones which were destroyed by the construction of the mall.

The Norwood Historical Society was chartered on May 2, 1978.

In 1985, Norwood natives Carl Lindner Jr. and his brother Robert Lindner donated $150,000 to the City of Norwood so it could purchase the 14-acre McCullough Estate. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources also awarded a matching grant so the estate could be converted into a nature preserve and park. The estate was part of the original 100-acre McCullough Seed Company property the McCullough Family settled in 1850 and operated on this land until 1960. Although the park is located in Cincinnati, it is owned and operated as a City of Norwood park. Norwood now totaled 30-acres of recreation land among 9 city parks.

===GM closure===
On November 6, 1986, General Motors announced that it would close the Norwood Assembly automobile plant as part of a $10 billion plan to reorganize the company. Many Norwood employees expected Norwood&#x27;s sister plant, Van Nuys Assembly, to close instead. However, GM stated that the aging Norwood plant would be difficult to modernize and the campus was &quot;landlocked&quot; with no room for expansion. The company also cited high absenteeism, low productivity and low quality control as additional factors in its decision.

The closure of the plant in 1987 nearly dealt a death blow to Norwood&#x27;s economy. GM was by far the largest employer in Norwood and its income and property taxes accounted for one-third of the city&#x27;s operating budget and one-fifth of the money for its schools. Approximately 1,000 of the factory&#x27;s 4,300 workers were Norwood residents.

As a result of the closure, Norwood City Council dramatically slashed the city&#x27;s budget. Norwood&#x27;s parks, roads, buildings, water lines began to deteriorate. The City of Cincinnati even considered annexing Norwood to help with financial problems, but the plan was rebuffed by Cincinnati Mayor Charles Luken, who said he had no intention of &quot;taking advantage of Norwood&#x27;s misfortune.&quot; Norwood&#x27;s mayor, Joseph E. Sanker, publicly speculated that Cincinnati was not interested in Norwood without the GM plant.

Norwood&#x27;s economic issues continued to worsen in 1988 when another long-time manufacturing business, R. K. LeBlond Machine Tool Company, closed its Norwood factory.

In 1989, Norwood&#x27;s last remaining newspaper, The Norwood Enterprise, ceased publication. Other Norwood community newspapers have occasionally started in the years since the Enterprise ceased publication, but none have lasted more than a few years. The Norwood Star currently operates as a monthly newspaper.

===Economic revitalization===
Despite the dire financial situation in Norwood, it did not take long for the city to realize the closing of General Motors was an opportunity to transition its image from a blue-collar industrial city to a business and retail destination. In 1989, city signed a deal with the Belvedere Corporation to develop both the former GM site. The same year, the city also made plans to build a retail and restaurant complex called Rookwood Pavilion on the site of the old LeBlond plant. In 1990, the first of these new projects, a shopping plaza called Grand Central Station, opened at the site of the old GM plant.

In July 1990, a cleaning solvent leak at the BASF chemical plant on the border of Norwood and Evanston resulted in an explosion, killing two and injuring 90 people. The blast heavily damaged Norwood businesses and affected Norwood homes as far as a mile away.

In 1993, the Belvedere Corporation opened a second new development called Central Parke. The project consisted of mixed-use office buildings.

In 1993, developers opened the Rookwood Pavilion shopping center on the grounds of the old Lablond factory site. Rookwood Pavilion was successful and prompted developers to begin purchasing additional land in the area for future developments. In 2000, Rookwood Commons shopping center opened immediately behind Rookwood Pavilion.

Despite sporadic efforts to save what was remaining of &quot;The Pike,&quot; the city allowed the demolition of several historic storefronts and buildings in 2002.

In 2004, Norwood was forced by the State of Ohio to reduce the number of city council wards from 6 to 4, to reflect a decline in population.

Norwood also lost a significant amount of public transportation in 2004 when the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority eliminated all but two bus routes in the city. Some of the eliminated routes had serviced the city by either bus or streetcar for over 100 years.

In fall of 2004, another new development called Cornerstone At Norwood was constructed.

===Eminent domain===
After the success of the two Rookwood shopping centers, the developer, Jeffrey Anderson, approached the City of Norwood regarding a third project called Rookwood Exchange that he wanted to build across the street. He proposed bulldozing a residential neighborhood and replacing them with a new mixed-use residential, office, and retail development.

The city approved the plan and Anderson began purchasing the neighborhood properties in 2005 through voluntary sales. All of the property owners eventually agreed to sell except for three which refused to leave. In an effort to clear the remaining properties, Anderson paid for a study declaring the neighborhood a &quot;deteriorating area&quot; so the City of Norwood could use eminent domain to force the remaining property owners to sell.

The three property owners fought Norwood&#x27;s use of eminent domain, and the dispute eventually made national headlines in 2006 when it was brought before the Ohio Supreme Court in &quot;Norwood, Ohio v. Horney&quot;. The court ruled unanimously for the property owners, forcing the city and developers to return ownership of the three properties. After the verdict, the property owners held out for several more years before eventually selling. The second to last property was sold to the developer in 2007 for $650,000.

In September 2008, the final property owner agreed to sell his rental home to the developer for 1.25 million.

In 2014, after many years of legal battles and construction delays, Rookwood Exchange opened.
===Continued development===
In 2006, developers broke ground on Linden Pointe on the Lateral, a large office park complex on the old former American Laundry Machine Company and Globe Wernicke properties. Because the property was Brownfield land, it had to be decontaminated prior to construction.

After more than 100 years in Norwood, the US Playing Card Company closed their Norwood factory and moved operations to Boone County, Kentucky in 2008.

Xavier University acquired the old Norwood Plaza shopping center and demolished many of the structures to make way for campus expansion. In a joint effort with Norwood and Cincinnati, Xavier University opened University Station.

The current mayor of Norwood is Victor Schneider, the Safety-Service Director (Chief Administrative Officer) is Noah Powers,the police chief is Dwayne Sumner, the fire chief is Thomas McCabe, and the public works superintendent is Clint Zimmerman.

==Economy==
Norwood has a strong history of industry and manufacturing dating back to the historic Norwood Brick plant of the late 19th century, which provided clay brick for the construction of many of Cincinnati&#x27;s historic buildings. As the city is ideally situated between several major railways, state roads and interstate highways, it has traditionally been an attractive location for businesses and corporations in the area. Norwood was once described as the &quot;Chicago of Hamilton County&quot;, for in 1909 it had 49 manufacturing enterprises.

Prominent Norwood industrial and manufacturing companies included: General Motors Norwood Assembly, United Dairy Farmers, Allis-Chalmers, Siemens, Bullock Electric Manufacturing Company, United States Playing Card Company, Globe Wernicke, American Laundry Machine Company, Norwood Sash &amp; Door Company (Sears Catalog Homes), United States Printing &amp; Lithographing Company, U.S. Shoe Corp, Mead Container Corporation, J.H. Day Corporation, and Zumbiel Packaging.

Between 1923 and 1987, the General Motors automobile assembly plant was by far the city&#x27;s largest employer in terms of production, payroll and employees. When GM closed the factory in 1987, it nearly dealt a death blow to Norwood&#x27;s economy. This event became the catalyst for Norwood&#x27;s transition from an industrial economy to a diversified office and retail economy. In the years following the GM closure, Norwood worked with developers to build many mixed-use office parks and retail centers in the city, including: Grande Central Station (1990), Central Parke (1993), Rookwood Pavilion (1995), Rookwood Commons (2000), Cornerstone at Norwood (2004), Linden Pointe on the Lateral (2007), Surrey Square (2008), Rookwood Exchange (2014), Norwood State Station (2014).

==Education==
The Norwood City School District consists of Norwood High School, Norwood Middle School, Sharpsburg Elementary, Norwood View Elementary, Williams Avenue Elementary, and Norwood Preschool. The current high school opened as a state-of-the-art facility in 1972, with a planetarium, greenhouse, swimming pool, and television studio. Drake Planetarium, named after astronomer and astrophysicist Frank Drake, is associated with NASA. Norwood High School&#x27;s mascot is the Indian. Norwood Middle School is located next to the high school in the previous high school building, which opened in 1914. In 1988, the Norwood Middle School field house and offices were used to film prison scenes in the 1989 Tom Selleck movie An Innocent Man. Norwood is also home to Immaculate Conception Academy parochial grade school and high school, located in the former Gressle School on Floral Avenue.

==Sports and recreation==
===Norwood Recreation Commission===

The Norwood Recreation Commission was established in 1943, by ordinance of the City Council. The commission is unique in that it is a non-political joint effort between the city and Board of Education. The commission consists of five policy makers; two selected by the Board of Education and three appointed by the mayor.

The Norwood Recreation Commission operates and supervises four playgrounds and three swimming pools during the summer months. Permits for ball diamonds, tennis courts and picnic areas are also issued through the Recreation office. The Recreation Commission conducts leagues for 30 softball teams for men and women in addition to assisting and cooperating with the Norwood Knothole Association and Norwood Soccer Association in providing facilities for all their teams. In the past the Norwood Recreation Commission has moved into the schools with its Fall, Winter, and Spring programs.

==History==
In 1794, Abraham Voorhees moved his family from Somerset County, New Jersey, building a large double log cabin along the west bank of the Millcreek in Sycamore Township, in present-day Lockland. In the spring of 1795, Harvey Redinbo, a Pennsylvania Dutchman, visited from Reading, Pennsylvania. Pleased with the land that Voorhees had acquired, Redinbo purchased his own land, in the area of Hunt Road and Columbia Avenue. Around 1798, Voorhees platted a town named Voorhees-Town but did not record it with county officials until January 7, 1804. By then, Redinbo had convinced him to rename the town to Reading, after Redinbo&#x27;s hometown.

Between 1830 and 1880, Reading grew rapidly to become the largest village in Hamilton County. It was incorporated as a village on March 24, 1851. The village&#x27;s major industry was clothing manufacturing.

<text>Silverton is a village in Hamilton County, Ohio, United States. The village was formed out of Columbia and Sycamore townships, but withdrew from both and formed a paper township. The population was 4,908 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Formed out of Columbia and Sycamore townships, Silverton had its beginnings in the post-Revolutionary War land grants. In 1809 David Mosner opened a general store at the crossroads of Plainfield Pike and Montgomery Road. For the next several decades the surrounding town was known alternately as &quot;Mosner&quot; or &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The Mosner name was formalized in 1861 when a post office opened under that designation.

In 1883 the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway opened a line through town, connecting the area to Cincinnati by rail. Seth Haines and Robert Cresap platted Silverton&#x27;s first subdivision shortly thereafter. It is widely accepted that the town was renamed Silverton in honor of Haines&#x27; wife, Elizabeth Silver Haines.

In 1884 the community was incorporated as the Hamlet of Silverton. The early subdivisions were designed to appeal to investors as well as prospective homeowners. These subdivisions were divided into large lots, as most of them had frontages.

The hamlet slowly developed into a suburb over the next twenty years, with village status attained by general election in 1904. The village was by then served by the Interurban Railway &amp; Terminal Company line, which ran along Montgomery Road (now U.S. Route 22), as well as the CL&amp;N. Residents regularly commuted to jobs in Cincinnati.

By 1910 the village had a population of 459. Silverton grew over the next 50 years, attaining city status in 1961 with a population exceeding 5,500.

Around the beginning of the 20th century, the John C. Meier Grape Juice Company purchased land along the railroad line and began producing grape juice and wine in Silverton. Now known as Meier&#x27;s Wine Cellars, it is both the oldest and largest winery in Ohio.

Silverton&#x27;s demographics began to expand in the 1960s to include more African-American families. The &quot;white flight&quot; experienced by many other communities was not a factor in Silverton. Organizations like the Silverton Neighborhood Association were formed to break through cultural barriers and to promote dialogue between neighbors. As a result, Silverton transformed itself into a integrated community.

In 1974, Silverton elected its first African American Mayor, Richard F. Hunter, Sr. who served as a Silverton Councilmember previously. Mayor Hunter served the City of Silverton as Mayor over 20 years and longer than any mayor in the city’s history.

Silverton received recognition as a Tree City USA community in 2008.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

==Government==
The Village of Silverton is a charter municipality and operates under the council-manager form of government, combining the strong political leadership of elected officials with the professional expertise of an appointed village manager.

Legislative authority under this form of government is vested in Village Council, the body that is chosen by the electorate. Council hires the manager to serve as the village&#x27;s full-time chief executive officer.

Silverton Village Council consists of six members elected at-large to serve two year terms. In addition to appointing the village manager and passing legislation, Council approves the annual operating budget, contracts in the village&#x27;s name, levies taxes, and appoints a village attorney.

The Mayor, who is directly elected to a two-year term, serves as the official and ceremonial head of the village and presides over all meetings of Council. He has the right to introduce legislation and to take part in discussion of all matters before Council with the right to vote in the event of a tie.

The village manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the village, implements Council action, hires and oversees the staff, prepares and implements the annual operating budget and keeps the elected officials advised of the village&#x27;s financial viability.

==Municipal services==

Silverton offers a wide range of municipal services. The village is patrolled by the Hamilton County Sheriff&#x27;s Office (HCSO) deputies. In 1999 the residents of Silverton and neighboring Deer Park voted to form the Deer Park Silverton Joint Fire District. The district offers fire protection and EMS/paramedic services to the communities of Silverton and Deer Park, as well as Golf Manor and portions of Columbia Township.

Residents of Silverton enjoy two parks: Ralph Ficke Memorial Park and Silverton Park.

Ficke Park was the larger of the two at . It offered a playground, baseball diamonds, a regulation size soccer field, full court basketball, hard court tennis and a batting cage. Two shelters were available for rental. Park events include an annual Easter egg hunt and a summer concert series.

The village council unanimously approved a land swap with Cincinnati Public Schools in order to build a new school on half of Ficke Park. The move is opposed by nearby residents, especially in neighboring Sycamore Township who argue that they were not consulted or informed of the proposed land swap. The land swap will likely be challenged on the premise that the land deed forbids the use of the land for anything other than a park or similar. On July 14, 2008, the Cincinnati Board of Education approved the land swap.

As a result of the land swap, CPS now owns half of Ficke park. The CPS owned half contains the shelters (that are no longer available for rental), the tennis courts (which no longer have nets), the playground and the basketball court. When construction for the new school begins, all these facilities will be lost. Some are scheduled to be rebuilt in the remaining half of the park.

Silverton Park is located in the center of town in a &quot;village green&quot; setting. The Kuhnell Museum, a replica of the village&#x27;s original train depot, is located in the park. The museum is a source of great pride for Silverton residents. Johnny Kuhnell, the village&#x27;s Chief of Police from 1946 to 1969, envisioned a replicated station as a focal point of the community, so he organized an effort to reconstruct the station. His goal was realized in 1974 when construction of the replica was completed. The museum was rededicated in honor and memory of Chief Kuhnell in 2001.

The station today serves as a museum dedicated to the preservation of Silverton history for future generations. Inside you will find photographs, articles and memorabilia related to the Silverton area from the 1800s to the present. Visitors will gain perspective on the village&#x27;s history and the pride employed by area pioneers. The museum is open to the public on the second and fourth Sunday of each month from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m, April through September.

<text>Terrace Park is a village in Hamilton County, Ohio, and a suburb of Greater Cincinnati. The population was 2,355 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The primary document for the history of Terrace Park is &quot;A Place Called Terrace Park&quot; by Ellis Rawnsley (1992).

Rawnsley notes that the earliest human inhabitants of Terrace Park may have arrived as early as 12,000 years ago—the Paleo-Indians. Although &quot;no traces of established settlements have ever been found,&quot; flints showing evidence of these nomadic people have been found in various locations in the areas surrounding Terrace Park.

Circa approximately 1000 B.C., settlements appeared in Hamilton County, Ohio.

According to Rawnsley, &quot;Two thousand or more years ago, a primitive people built, in what is now Terrace Park, one of the largest of its kind of the 295 prehistoric earthworks ever found in Hamilton County.&quot;

Mounds from the Adena culture are found throughout a wide area which contains Terrace Park.

In January 1789, Abraham Covalt established a small fortified settlement called Covalt Station in what is now Terrace Park. The area was surrounded by Shawnee settlements, and the Shawnee were hostile towards the white settlement in their midst. Covalt Station had to be abandoned in 1792 due to continuing attacks by the Shawnee, and white settlers only returned after General &quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne defeated the Native American Western Confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers and secured the Treaty of Greenville which ceded all of southern Ohio (and other territory) to the United States. Before roads and railroads connected the village to other nearby settlements, such as Milford, most residents of Terrace Park kept cattle and chickens, and engaged in other agricultural activities for their own subsistence, and had &quot;homesteads&quot; as opposed to the ordered residential village of today.

Terrace Park was incorporated in 1893.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Terrace Park feeds into the Mariemont City School District, which includes Mariemont High School.

<text>The Village of Indian Hill is a city in Hamilton County, Ohio, United States, and a suburb of the Greater Cincinnati area. The population was 6,087 at the 2020 census. Prior to 1970, Indian Hill was incorporated as a village, but under Ohio law became designated as a city once its population was verified as exceeding 5,000.

The Village of Indian Hill is served by the Indian Hill Exempted Village School District (public school district).

==History==
The Village of Indian Hill began as a farming community which prospered as the nearby Little Miami Railroad provided cost effective shipping to Cincinnati. From about 1904, Cincinnatians bought up its farmhouses as rural weekend destinations. They reached Indian Hill on the Swing Line, a train running between downtown Cincinnati and Ramona Station; the site is now the location of Indian Hill&#x27;s administration building at Drake and Shawnee Run roads.

The rolling country appealed to a group of four Cincinnati businessmen who had built homes there in the early 1920s and envisioned a more ambitious rural settlement, persuading friends to join them in forming the Camargo Realty Company in 1924. Camargo assembled of farmland and divided some into plots, sold for $75 to $150 per acre, and a district of grand mansions with stables and outbuildings grew up, with kennels that housed the Camargo Hunt. Some were authentic estates, such as the &quot;Peterloon&quot; of John J. Emery, which has since been subdivided into lots as small as .

<text>Wyoming is a city in Hamilton County, Ohio. It is a suburb of the neighboring city of Cincinnati. The population was 8,756 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Among the earliest European-American settlers in what is now Wyoming was the Pendery family, who arrived in 1805. Wyoming was named after Wyoming County, Pennsylvania, where some settlers had come from. Robert Reily is considered the &quot;Father of Wyoming&quot; with men and women gathering at his home one week prior to the start of the Civil War in 1861 choosing the name of the village - Wyoming, a Delaware Indian term meaning &quot;large plains.&quot; In 1874, Wyoming officially became a Village with 600 residents; and in 1951, the Village incorporated as a city of over 5,000 persons, implementing the Council-Manager form of government.

Good transportation is an integral part of Wyoming&#x27;s history and the leading reason for its prosperity. The city lies near the old pre-statehood road associated with Anthony Wayne that connected Cincinnati with locations farther north, such as Fort Hamilton and Fallen Timbers. Curves in the road were cut off in 1806 forming Springfield Pike through central Wyoming, later a toll road established by farmers Burns, Riddle, and Pendery of the Hamilton, Springfield, and Carthage Turnpike Company. In 1828, another mode of transportation became significant in the Miami and Erie Canal, built a short distance to the east. Railroads reached the city in 1851 with the construction of the Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Dayton Railroad forming the border between Lockland and Wyoming. With wide adoption of automobiles in the early 20th century, the Wright Highway and Mill Creek Expressway eventually became Interstate 75 (I-75) by the mid-20th century to present, which primarily runs through the Ohio Department of Transportation right-of-way; originally the Miami and Erie Canal and its locks east of Wyoming.

Because of Wyoming&#x27;s proximity to the thriving 19th century industry in Lockland, its easy transportation to the booming city of Cincinnati during the Gilded Age, and its pleasant scenery, many wealthy industrialists purchased local farms and built grand country houses.

Over multiple generations, early farms subdivided and additional areas were annexed into the city forming a primarily residential, pedestrian-scale bedroom community with emphasis on its educational and community-oriented values, culture, and assets. Wyoming was the first community in the State of Ohio to implement a systematic laying of concrete sidewalks.

===Architecture &amp; the &#x27;Village Historic District&#x27;===
As Wyoming grew throughout the 19th and into the 20th Century, &quot;The Village&quot; and &quot;Wyoming Hills&quot; became distinctive areas of the community, unique in their architecture and topography. While brick is commonplace exterior for buildings in Southwestern Ohio, weatherboard siding and historic Victorian architecture is predominant in the Village Historic District. The proximity of the lumber mills along the Miami and Erie Canal and influence of original settlers and neighboring communities created the distinct New England weatherboard character; with the most notable historic vista in the Village Historic District lying along Worthington Avenue just south of Wyoming Ave. 

In the early 1900s, proximity to the railroad lines added many Sears Modern Homes (&quot;kit homes&quot;), and other similar manufacturers, that shipped the building components via railroad boxcars to be assembled on site, having been selected by owners through mail order catalog. These added homes generally were built on lots divided from the original and built between the Victorian houses. Other styles such as ranch homes, contemporary, mid-century modern, and others became prominent in the Wyoming Hills area as intensive suburban development occurred after World War II.

The Wyoming Ohio Historical Society was formed in the early 1980s prior to establishment of the city&#x27;s Village Historic District in 1986, listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It promotes historical research and preservation of Wyoming&#x27;s heritage while operating the Wyoming History Museum. The district itself contains approximately three hundred 19th and early 20th century homes.

<text>Findlay ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Hancock County, Ohio, United States. The second-largest city in Northwest Ohio, Findlay lies about 40 miles (64 km) south of Toledo. Its population was 40,313 at the 2020 census. The principal city of the Findlay micropolitan area, it is home to the University of Findlay and the headquarters of &quot;Fortune&quot; 100 company Marathon Petroleum.

==History==

In the War of 1812, Colonel James Findlay of Cincinnati built a road and a stockade to transport and shelter troops in the Great Black Swamp region. This stockade was named Fort Findlay in his honor. At the conclusion of the war, the community of Findlay was born. The first town lots were laid out in 1821 by future Ohio Governor Joseph Vance and Elnathan Corry.

Before the Civil War, Findlay was a stop for slaves along the Underground Railroad.

In 1861, David Ross Locke moved to Findlay, where he served as editor for the &quot;Hancock Jeffersonian&quot; newspaper until he left in 1865. It was in the Hancock Jeffersonian that Locke penned the first of his Nasby letters.

During the 1880s, Findlay was a booming center of oil and natural gas production, though the supply of petroleum had dwindled by the early 20th century.

Findlay hosted the highly competitive Ohio State Music Festival in 1884. A young cornet player, Warren G. Harding, and his Citizens&#x27; Cornet Band of Marion placed third in the competition. Harding went on to be elected the 29th President of the United States.

On March 31, 1892, the only known lynching in the history of Hancock County occurred when a mob of 1,000 men, many &quot;respectable citizens&quot;, broke into the county jail in Findlay. They lynched Mr. Lytle, who had seriously (but not fatally as believed at the time) injured his wife and two daughters with a hatchet the day before, by hanging him twice (first from the bridge, then a telegraph pole) and finally shooting his body over a dozen times. The authorities had intended to secretly convey the prisoner to a suburb at one o&#x27;clock, where a train was to have been taken for Lima, but their plans were frustrated by the mob.

In 1908, American songwriter Tell Taylor wrote the standard, &quot;Down by the Old Mill Stream&quot; while fishing along the Blanchard River in Findlay. The song was published in 1910.

A disaster occurred during the 1936 Independence Day celebration, where a stray firework fell into a crowd, injuring 16 people and attracting national media attention.

For three months in the early 1960s, Findlay had the distinction of being the only community in the world where touch-tone telephone service was available. Touch-tone service was first introduced there on November 1, 1960.

In 2007, a flood that crested at 18.46 feet caused around $100 million in damage. The flood was nearly as strong as the 1913 flood.

Another new school built directly behind the original Glenwood building on North Main Street officially opened and began usage in January 2013. The building known as Central, located on West Main Cross, was originally Findlay&#x27;s high school (until the current high school was built in 1963). Once the two new middle schools were opened, part of Central was razed, leaving only the auditorium. A new Performing Arts Center (funded mainly by Marathon Petroleum) was constructed by refurbishing and renovating Central&#x27;s auditorium, finishing in December 2015.

<doc id="129394" wikidata="Q7712216" url="?curid=129394" title="The Accidental Tourist">
<text>The Accidental Tourist is a 1985 novel by Anne Tyler that was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction in 1985 and the Ambassador Book Award for Fiction in 1986. The novel was adapted into a 1988 award-winning film starring William Hurt, Kathleen Turner, and Geena Davis, for which Davis won an Academy Award.

==Plot summary==
Set in Baltimore, Maryland, the plot revolves around Macon Leary, a writer of travel guides whose son has been killed in a shooting at a fast-food restaurant. He and his wife, Sarah, separately lost in grief, find their marriage disintegrating until she eventually moves out. When he becomes incapacitated due to a fall involving his disturbed dog and one of his crazy inventions, Macon returns to the family home to stay with his eccentric siblings, sister Rose and brothers Porter and Charles, whose odd habits include alphabetizing the groceries in the kitchen cabinets and ignoring the ringing telephone. When Macon&#x27;s publisher, Julian, comes to visit, he finds himself attracted to Rose. They eventually marry, though Rose later moves back in with her brothers, followed months later by Julian, who becomes part of the family. 

Macon hires Muriel Pritchett, an unusual woman in her own right, to train his unruly dog, and soon finds himself drifting into a relationship with her and her sickly son, Alexander. In stark contrast to Sarah, Muriel is brash, garrulous, unsophisticated, and fond of garish outfits; and in stark contrast to the relatively passive Macon, she is strong and assertive. Despite his resistance to a new commitment, Macon finds himself drawn towards Muriel, surprised by her perceptiveness, strength and optimism, and ability to listen. Increasingly attached to both Muriel and Alexander, he moves into their little house in a seedy part of town. Macon finds that he loves &quot;the surprise of her, and also the surprise of himself when he was with her. In the foreign country that was Singleton Street he was an entirely different person.&quot; When Sarah learns of these developments, she decides she and Macon should reconcile, forcing him to come to a decision about their future.

==Reception==

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Larry McMurtry says, &quot;Tyler shows, with a fine clarity, the mingling of misery and contentment in the daily lives of her families, reminds us how alike—and yet distinct—happy and unhappy families can be. Muriel Pritchett is as appealing a woman as Miss Tyler has created; and upon the quiet Macon she lavishes the kind of intelligent consideration that he only intermittently gets from his own womenfolk&quot;.

Michiko Kakutani wrote, &quot;It is from just such private lives that Miss Tyler herself has spun her own minutely detailed art, rendering them with such warmth and fidelity that her readers, too, are startled into a new appreciation of the ordinary and mundane. Like John Updike, she has taken as her fictional territory that sprawling American landscape of the middle class, and in 10 novels now, she has claimed as her special province the family in all its contrary dimensions.&quot;

In contrast to most critics, John Blades, in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, wrote a scathing review: &quot;In an age of dissonant, aggressive fiction, Tyler has established herself as a voice of sweet reason, the heiress apparent to Eudora Welty as the earth mother of American writers. For all Tyler&#x27;s seductive qualities—the great charm and coziness of her fictional universe, her compassion for misfits, and, not least, her soothing, almost tranquilizing voice—there is something annoyingly synthetic about the work itself. However wise and wonderful, her fiction is seriously diluted by the promiscuous use of artificial sweeteners, a practice that has made Tyler our foremost NutraSweet novelist.&quot;

Edward Hoagland wrote in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;Macon Leary, the magnificently decent yet &quot;ordinary&quot; man in &quot;The Accidental Tourist,&quot; follows logic to its zany conclusions, and in doing this justifies...the catch-as-catch-can nature of much of life, making us realize that we are probably missing people of mild temperament in our own acquaintance who are heroes, too, if we had Ms. Tyler&#x27;s eye for recognizing them...Muriel, the man-chaser and man-saver of &quot;The Accidental Tourist,&quot; ranks among the more endearing characters of postwar literature.&quot;

<text>Van Buren is a village in Hancock County, Ohio, United States. The population was 396 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Van Buren was laid out in 1833, and named for Martin Van Buren, then incumbent Vice President (1833–1837) and afterward President of the United States (1837–1841). The village was incorporated in 1866.

The first schoolhouse in Allen Township was a small log structure built in 1836. It was built of round logs covered with a clapboard roof, had greased paper windows and a huge fireplace at one end. About 1870 a two-room brick building was built on East Market Street. This building was later condemned and a four-room school was erected and used till 1917 when the schools of Allen Township were centralized and the present school, Van Buren High School, was erected.

A post office called Van Buren has been in operation since 1835. 

Van Buren is also home to the Van Buren State Park. Van Buren State Park&#x27;s history traces back to its origins as a designated wildlife preserve. In 1939, the construction of a dam on Rocky Ford Creek was undertaken to enhance the area&#x27;s fish and wildlife resources. By 1950, the stewardship of this land was transferred to Ohio State Parks, where it has remained as a cherished state park ever since. This park bears the name of Martin Van Buren, the nation&#x27;s eighth President.

Once home to the Shawnee people, the environment surrounding Van Buren State Park is characterized by bountiful woodlands and fertile agricultural lands. Comprising 296 acres, the park serves as a serene and peaceful sanctuary, welcoming year-round visitors to partake in activities such as camping, fishing, hiking, horseback riding, and picnicking.

The growth of the village is due in large part to the founding of the Ohio Normal School, now known as Ohio Northern University.

The city began as a center for agricultural trade, then in the late 19th century, developed industry common to America of the time. From 1890 to 1952, Kenton was home to the Kenton Hardware Company, manufacturers of locks, cast-iron toys, and the very popular Gene Autry toy cap guns.

International Car Company, a manufacturer of rail cabooses, operated in Kenton for many years. In 1975, it was purchased by Paccar, a manufacturer of medium- and heavy-duty trucks. In 1983, Paccar closed down the business, noting a decrease in demand for rail equipment.

<text>Mississippi Burning is a 1988 American crime thriller film directed by Alan Parker and written by Chris Gerolmo that is loosely based on the 1964 investigation into the deaths of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner in Mississippi. It stars Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe as two FBI agents investigating the disappearance of three civil rights workers in fictional Jessup County, Mississippi, who are met with hostility by the town&#x27;s residents, local police, and the Ku Klux Klan.

Gerolmo began writing the script in 1986 after researching the 1964 murders of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner. He and producer Frederick Zollo presented it to Orion Pictures, and the studio hired Parker to direct. The writer and director had disputes over the script, and Orion allowed Parker to make uncredited rewrites. The film was shot in a number of locations in Mississippi and Alabama, with principal photography from March to May 1988.

On release, &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; was criticized by activists involved in the civil rights movement and the families of Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner for its fictionalization of events. Critical reaction was generally positive, with praise aimed towards the cinematography and the performances of Hackman, Dafoe and Frances McDormand. The film grossed $34.6 million in North America against a production budget of $15 million. It received seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, and won for Best Cinematography.

==Plot==

In 1964, three civil rights workers – two Jewish and one black – go missing while they are in fictional Jessup County, Mississippi (the actual events took place in Neshoba County), organizing a voter registry for African Americans. The FBI sends Alan Ward and Rupert Anderson to investigate. Ward is a Northerner, senior in rank but much younger than Anderson, and approaches the investigation by the book. In contrast, Anderson, a former Mississippi sheriff, is more nuanced in his approach. The pair find it difficult to conduct interviews with the local townspeople, as Sheriff Ray Stuckey and his deputies influence the public and are linked to a branch of the Ku Klux Klan.

With the help of the son of a local pastor, the FBI is finally able to bring forward a witness who saw Klansmen firebomb a house, and three white men are arrested and tried for felony arson. A local judge, however, gives the men a token suspended sentence while deriding the FBI as &quot;outside agitators&quot; who provoked the men to violence. He then releases the men, who promptly hang the witness&#x27; father and attempt to kill the witness. The FBI evacuate the family to the north and realize they will receive no help at all from local authorities.

Meanwhile, Anderson has developed a close relationship with the wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell who, in a tearful confession, reveals to Anderson that the three missing men have been murdered by her husband and his Klansmen accomplices, who then buried the bodies in an earthen dam. After the bodies are discovered, revealing to the nation that the disappearance of the civil rights workers was in fact murder, Pell beats his wife brutally in retribution after discovering her betrayal.

Ward and Anderson&#x27;s different approaches spill over into a physical fight which Ward wins, but he concedes that his methods have been ineffective, and he gives Anderson carte blanche authorization to deal with the problem in his own way. Anderson devises a plan to indict members of the Klan for civil rights violations instead of murder, because civil rights violations are federal crimes for which conviction is more certain than state-level charges of murder. The FBI arranges the kidnapping of Mayor Tilman, taking him to a remote shack, where he is left with a black man who threatens to castrate him unless he speaks out. Tilman gives him a complete description of the killings, including the names of those who were involved in it. The abductor is revealed to be an FBI operative who has been assigned to intimidate Tilman. Although the obtained information is inadmissible in court because it was obtained by coercion, it still proves to be valuable to the investigators.

Anderson and Ward concoct a plan, luring identified Klan collaborators to a bogus meeting, but the men soon realize that they have been set up and they leave the bogus meeting without discussing the murders. The FBI then concentrates on Lester Cowens, a Klansman of interest who exhibits a nervous demeanor, which the agents believe might yield a confession. The Feds pick him up and interrogate him. Anderson stages a tussle with Pell at the local barbershop in retaliation for the attack on his wife and takes off. Later, Cowens is at home when a shotgun blast shatters his windows. After seeing a burning cross on his lawn, he attempts to flee in his truck but is caught by several hooded men who intend to hang him. The team arrives to rescue him, having staged the entire scene where the hooded men are revealed to be other FBI agents.

Cowens, believing that his redneck brothers have threatened his life because of his admissions to the FBI, finally incriminates his accomplices. The Klansmen are charged with civil rights violations. Most of the perpetrators are convicted and are sentenced to 3–10 years imprisonment, while Sherriff Stuckey is acquitted. The FBI later finds Tilman has hanged himself, and Bird wonders why. Ward tells him Tilman was guilty, for being a witness. Mrs. Pell returns to her home, which has been completely ransacked by vandals. She resolves to stay and rebuild her life, free of her husband. Before they leave town, Anderson and Ward visit an integrated congregation, gathered at an African American cemetery, where the black civil rights activist&#x27;s desecrated gravestone reads, &quot;Not Forgotten.&quot;

==Cast==

==Historical context==

On June 21, 1964, civil rights workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were arrested in Philadelphia, Mississippi, by Deputy Sheriff Cecil Price, and taken to a Neshoba County jail. The three men worked on the &quot;Freedom Summer&quot; campaign, attempting to organize a voter registry for African Americans. Price charged Chaney with speeding and held the other two men for questioning. He released the three men on bail seven hours later and followed them out of town. After Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner failed to return to Meridian, Mississippi, on time, workers for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) placed calls to the Neshoba County jail, asking if the police had any information on their whereabouts. Two days later, FBI agent John Proctor and ten other agents began their investigation in Neshoba County. They received a tip about a burning CORE station wagon seen in the woods off Highway 21, about 20 miles northeast of Philadelphia. The investigation was given the code name &quot;MIBURN&quot; (short for &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot;), and top FBI inspectors were sent to help with the case.

On August 4, 1964, the bodies of the three men were found after an informant nicknamed &quot;Mr. X&quot; in FBI reports passed along a tip to federal authorities. They were discovered underneath an earthen dam on a 253-acre farm located a few miles outside Philadelphia, Mississippi. All three men had been shot. Nineteen suspects were the subject of a federal indictment for violating the workers&#x27; civil rights. On October 27, 1967, a federal trial conducted in Meridian resulted in only seven of the defendants, including Price, being convicted with sentences ranging from three to ten years. Nine were acquitted, and the jury deadlocked on three others.

==Production==

===Development===
In 1985, screenwriter Chris Gerolmo discovered an article that excerpted a chapter from the book &quot;Inside Hoover&#x27;s F.B.I.&quot;, which chronicled the FBI&#x27;s investigation into the murders of Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner. While writing a draft script, Gerolmo brought it to producer Frederick Zollo, who worked with him on &quot;Miles from Home&quot; (1988). Zollo helped Gerolmo develop the original draft before they sold it to Orion Pictures.

The studio then began its search for a director. Filmmakers Miloš Forman and John Schlesinger were among those considered. In September 1987, Alan Parker was given a copy of Gerolmo&#x27;s script by Orion&#x27;s executive vice president and co-founder Mike Medavoy. When Parker traveled to Tokyo, Japan, to act as a juror for the 1987 Tokyo International Film Festival, his colleague Robert F. Colesberry began researching the time period, and compiled books, newspaper articles, live news footage and photographs related to the 1964 murders. Upon returning to the United States, Parker met with Colesberry in New York and spent several months viewing the research. The director also began selecting the creative team; the production reunited Parker with many of his past collaborators, including Colesberry, casting directors Howard Feuer and Juliet Taylor, director of photography Peter Biziou, editor Gerry Hambling, costume designer Aude Bronson-Howard, production designer Geoffrey Kirkland, camera operator Michael Roberts, and music composer Trevor Jones.

===Writing===
Gerolmo described his original draft script as &quot;a big, passionate, violent detective story set against the greatest sea-change in American life in the 20th century, the civil rights movement&quot;. For legal reasons, the names of the people and certain details related to the FBI&#x27;s investigation were changed. On presenting Clinton Pell&#x27;s wife as an informant, Gerolmo said, &quot;... the fact that no one knew who Mr. X, the informant, was, left that as a dramatic possibility for me, in my Hollywood movie version of the story. That&#x27;s why Mr. X became the wife of one of the conspirators.&quot; The abductor of Mayor Tilman was originally written as a Mafia hitman who forces a confession by putting a pistol in Tilman&#x27;s mouth. Gerolmo was inspired by Gregory Scarpa, a mob enforcer allegedly recruited by the FBI during their search for Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner.

After Parker was hired to direct the film, Gerolmo had completed two drafts. Parker met with Gerolmo at Orion&#x27;s offices in Century City, Los Angeles, where they began work on a third draft script. Both the writer and director, however, had repeated disagreements over the focus of the story. To resolve the issue, Orion executives in New York gave Parker one month to make uncredited rewrites before green-lighting the project.

Parker made several changes from Gerolmo&#x27;s original draft. He omitted the Mafia hitman and created the character Agent Monk, a black FBI specialist who kidnaps Tilman. The scene in which Frank Bailey brutally beats a news cameraman was based on an actual event; Parker and Colesberry were inspired by a news outtake found during their research, in which a CBS News cameraman was assaulted by a suspect in the 1964 murder case. Parker also wrote a sex scene involving Rupert Anderson and Mrs. Pell. The scene was omitted during filming after Gene Hackman, who portrays Anderson, suggested to Parker that the relationship between the two characters be more discreet. By January 4, 1988, Parker had written a complete shooting script, which he submitted to Orion executives. Gerolmo did not visit the production during principal photography, due to the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike.

===Casting===

Parker held casting calls in New York, Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, Orlando, New Orleans, Raleigh and Nashville. The filmmakers did not retain the names of actual people; many of the supporting characters were composites of people related to the murder case. Gene Hackman plays Rupert Anderson, an FBI agent and former Mississippi sheriff. Brian Dennehy was briefly considered for the role before Orion suggested Hackman. As the script was being written, Parker frequently discussed the project with Hackman. Hackman said that &quot;it felt right to do something of historical import. It was an extremely intense experience, both the content of the film and the making of it in Mississippi.&quot;

Orion was less resolute in terms of who they wanted for the role of Agent Alan Ward. After filming &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988), Willem Dafoe expressed interest in playing Ward, and Parker traveled to Los Angeles, where he met with the actor to discuss the role. Dafoe was cast shortly thereafter. To prepare for the role, Dafoe researched the time period and Neshoba County. He also read Willie Morris&#x27;s 1983 novel &quot;The Courting of Marcus Dupree&quot;, and looked at 1960s documentary footage detailing how the media covered the murder case. Frances McDormand plays Mrs. Pell, the wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell. On working with Hackman, McDormand said: &quot;&quot;Mississippi Burning&quot;, I didn&#x27;t do research. All I did was listen to [Hackman]. He had an amazing capacity for not giving away any part of himself (in read-throughs). But the minute we got on the set, little blinds on his eyes flipped up and everything was available. It was mesmerizing. He&#x27;s really believable, and it was like a basic acting lesson.&quot;

Gailard Sartain plays Ray Stuckey, the sheriff of Jessup County, a character based on former Neshoba County sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey. Sartain described Stuckey as &quot;an elected official ... who has to be gregarious – but with sinister overtones&quot;. Stephen Tobolowsky plays Clayton Townley, a Grand Wizard of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The character is based on White Knights leader Samuel Bowers. Michael Rooker plays Frank Bailey, a Klansman involved in the murders of the three civil rights activists. Pruitt Taylor Vince, who had a small role in Parker&#x27;s previous film &quot;Angel Heart&quot;, plays Lester Cowens, a Klansman who unknowingly becomes a pawn in the FBI&#x27;s investigation. Vince described the character as &quot;goofy, stupid and geeky&quot; and stated, &quot;I never had a prejudiced bone in my body. It gave me a funny feeling to play this guy with a hood and everything. But when you&#x27;re in the midst of it, you just concentrate on getting through it.&quot;

Kevin Dunn joined the production in February 1988, appearing in his acting debut as FBI Agent Bird. Tobin Bell, also making his feature film debut, plays Agent Stokes, an FBI enforcer hired by Anderson to interrogate Cowens. Bell was first asked by Parker to read for the role of Clinton Pell, a role that was ultimately given to Brad Dourif.

Appearing as the three civil rights activists are Geoffrey Nauffts as &quot;Goatee&quot;, a character based on Michael Schwerner; Rick Zieff as &quot;Passenger&quot;, based on Andrew Goodman; and Christopher White as &quot;Black Passenger&quot;, based on James Chaney. Producers Frederick Zollo and Robert F. Colesberry also make appearances in the film; Zollo briefly appears as a news reporter, and Colesberry appears as a news cameraman who is brutally beaten by Frank Bailey. While scouting locations in Jackson, Mississippi, Parker arranged an open casting call for local actors and extras. He and Colesberry met music teacher Lannie McBride, who appears as a gospel singer in the film.

===Filming===

;Location scouting
During the screenwriting process, Parker and Colesberry began scouting locations. They visited eight states based on suggestions made by the location department. The shooting script required that a total of 62 locations be used for filming. In December 1987, Parker and Colesberry traveled to Mississippi to visit the stretch of road where Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner were murdered. The filmmakers were initially reluctant about filming in Mississippi; they expressed interest in filming in Forsyth County, Georgia, before being persuaded by John Horne, head of Mississippi&#x27;s film commission. Parker also met with Mississippi governor Ray Mabus, who voiced his support of the film&#x27;s production.

Parker and Colesberry looked at locations near Jackson, Mississippi, where they set up production offices at a Holiday Inn hotel. They also visited Canton, Mississippi, before travelling to Vaiden, Mississippi, where they scouted more than 200 courthouses that could be used for filming. Parker and Colesberry had difficulty finding a small town for the story setting before choosing LaFayette, Alabama, to act as scenes set in the fictional town of Jessup County, Mississippi, with other scenes being shot in a number of locales in Mississippi.

;Principal photography

Principal photography began on March 7, 1988, with a budget of $15 million. Filming began in Jackson, Mississippi, where the production team filmed a church being burned down. The sequence required a multiple-camera setup; a total of three cameras were used during the shoot. On March 8, the production team filmed a scene set in a motel where Anderson (Hackman) delivers a monologue to Ward (Dafoe). On March 10, production moved to a remote corner of Mississippi, where the crew filmed the burning of a parish church.

On March 11, the production filmed scenes set in a pig farm, where a young boy is confronted and attacked by three perpetrators. A night later, the crew shot the film&#x27;s opening sequence, in which the three civil rights workers are murdered. From March 14 to March 18, the crew filmed the burning of several more churches, as well as scenes set in a farm. On March 22, the crew filmed scenes set in a morgue that was located inside the University of Mississippi Medical Center, exactly the same location where the bodies of Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner were transported. A day later, Parker and the crew filmed a scene set in a cotton field. The art department had to dress each plant with layers of cotton, as the cotton plants had not fully bloomed. The crew also filmed the abduction of Mayor Tilman (R. Lee Ermey) and his subsequent interrogation by FBI agent Monk (Badja Djola). On March 24, the production moved to Raymond, Mississippi, where the crew filmed a scene at the John Bell Williams Airport. Depicting Monk&#x27;s departure, the scene was choreographed by Parker and the cast members so that it could be filmed in one take.

The production then moved to Vaiden, Mississippi to film scenes set in the Carroll County Courthouse, where several courtroom scenes, as well as scenes set in Sheriff Ray Stuckey&#x27;s office were filmed. The production moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi, where the crew filmed a funeral procession. On April 11, 1988, the crew filmed a scene set in the Cedar Hill Cemetery. From April 15 to April 16, the production moved to the Mississippi River valley to depict the FBI and United States Navy&#x27;s search for the three civil rights workers. The art department recreated a Choctaw Indian Village on the location, based on old photographs. On April 23, the crew filmed a scene depicting a Citizens&#x27; Councils rally with 750 extras. On April 25, the crew returned to Jackson, Mississippi, where an unused building was to recreate a diner that was found in Alabama during location scouting. A day later, Hackman and Dafoe filmed their opening scene, in which the characters Anderson and Ward drive to Jessup County, Mississippi.

On April 27, the production moved to LaFayette, Alabama, for the remainder of filming. From April 28 to April 29, Parker and his crew filmed scenes set in Mrs. Pell&#x27;s home. On May 5, the production shot one of the film&#x27;s final scenes, in which Anderson discovers Mrs. Pell&#x27;s home trashed. On May 13, the crew filmed scenes in a former LaFayette movie theatre. The art department restored the theatre&#x27;s interiors to reflect the time period. Filming concluded on May 14, 1988 with the Ku Klux Klan speech scene.

===Music===
The score was produced, arranged and composed by Trevor Jones, his second collaboration with Parker after &quot;Angel Heart&quot;. In addition to Jones&#x27;s score, the soundtrack features several gospel songs, including &quot;Walk on by Faith&quot; performed by Lannie McBride, &quot;Take My Hand, Precious Lord&quot; performed by Mahalia Jackson and &quot;Try Jesus&quot; performed by Vesta Williams. A motion picture soundtrack album was released by the recording labels Antilles Records and Island Records.

==Release==
&quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; held its world premiere at the Uptown Theatre in Washington, D.C., on December 2, 1988, with various politicians, ambassadors and political reporters in attendance. United States Senator Ted Kennedy voiced his support of the film, stating, &quot;This movie will educate millions of Americans too young to recall the sad events of that summer about what life was like in this country before the enactment of the civil rights laws.&quot; The film was given a platform release, first being released in a small number of cities in North America before opening nationwide. It opened in Washington, Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto and New York City on December 9, 1988. Orion was confident that the limited release would help qualify the film for Academy Awards consideration, and generate strong word-of-mouth support from audiences. The film opened in wide release on January 27, 1989, playing at 1,058 theaters, and expanding to 1,074 theatres by its ninth week.

===Box office===
&quot;Mississippi Burning&quot;″s first week of limited release saw it take $225,034, an average of $25,003.40 per theater. The film grossed an additional $160,628 in its second weekend. More theaters were added during the limited run, and on January 27, 1989, the film officially entered wide release. Over its first weekend of wide release, the film grossed $3,545,305, securing the number five position at the domestic box office with a domestic gross to date of $14,726,112. The film generated strong local interest in the state of Mississippi, resulting in sold-out showings in the first four days of wide release. After seven weeks of wide release, &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; ended its theatrical run with an overall gross of $34,603,943. In North America, it was the thirty-third highest-grossing film of 1988 and the seventeenth highest-grossing R-rated film of that year.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes sampled 28 reviews and gave &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; a score of 79%, with an average score of 6.8/10. The consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; draws on real-life tragedy to impart a worthy message with the measured control of an intelligent drama and the hard-hitting impact of a thriller.&quot; Another review aggregator, Metacritic, assigned the film a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on 11 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In a review for &quot;Time&quot; magazine entitled &quot;Just Another Mississippi Whitewash&quot;, author Jack E. White described the film as a &quot;cinematic lynching of the truth&quot;. Columnist Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; felt that the film &quot;speeds down the complicated, painful path of civil rights in search of a good thriller. Surprisingly, it finds it.&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum lambasted Parker&#x27;s direction and stated that the film&#x27;s focus on &quot;the FBI as the sole heroic defender of the victims of southern racism in 1964...subverts the history of the civil rights movement itself&quot;. In addition, he opined that the nonwhite characters in the film are portrayed as &quot;noble, suffering icons without any depth or personality&quot;. Rita Kempley, also writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, criticized the film for viewing &quot;the black struggle from an all-white perspective&quot;, and drew comparisons to &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; (1987), writing that both films had &quot;the right story, but with the wrong heroes.&quot; Pauline Kael, writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, praised the acting, but described the film as being &quot;morally repugnant&quot;.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film&#x27;s fictionalization of history, writing: &quot;The film doesn&#x27;t pretend to be about the civil-rights workers themselves. It&#x27;s almost as if Mr. Parker and Mr. Gerolmo respected the victims, their ideals and their fate too much to reinvent them through the use of fiction.&quot; In his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert surmised: &quot;We knew the outcome of this case when we walked into the theater. What we may have forgotten, or never known, is exactly what kinds of currents were in the air in 1964.&quot; On the syndicated television program &quot;Siskel and Ebert and the Movies&quot;, Ebert and his colleague Gene Siskel gave the film a &quot;two thumbs up&quot; rating. On his year-end top ten films list, Ebert ranked &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; the #1 movie of 1988. Writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Siskel praised Hackman and Dafoe&#x27;s &quot;subtle&quot; performances, but felt that McDormand was &quot;most effective as the film&#x27;s moral conscience&quot;.

Like Siskel, &quot;Variety&quot; magazine also praised the performances, writing: &quot;Dafoe gives a disciplined and noteworthy portrayal of Ward ... But it&#x27;s Hackman who steals the picture as Anderson ... Glowing performance of Frances McDormand as the deputy&#x27;s wife who&#x27;s drawn to Hackman is an asset both to his role and the picture.&quot; Sheila Benson, in her review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;: wrote, &quot;Hackman&#x27;s mastery at suggesting an infinite number of layers beneath a wry, self-deprecating surface reaches a peak here, but McDormand soars right with him. And since she is the film&#x27;s sole voice of morality, it&#x27;s right that she is so memorable.&quot;

===Controversy===
Following its release, &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; became embroiled in controversy over its fictionalization of events. Gerolmo and Parker have admitted taking artistic license with the source material, describing it as essentially a &quot;work of fiction&quot;. The killing itself, as portrayed in the film, differed from the actual events in several ways. In the film, during the car stop precipitating the murder, the driver is white (presumably either Andrew Goodman or Michael Schwerner), and the black civil rights volunteer (presumably James Chaney) is in the back seat. In reality, James Chaney drove the car because he was familiar with the area. The film presents the murders as having been committed at the scene of the stop while the victims were in their car, beginning with Frank Bailey putting a revolver to the temple of the car&#x27;s driver and shooting. In reality, all three victims were first taken to jail and were shot after their release. Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were shot once in the heart, followed by James Chaney who was shot three times. Much of the violence and intimidation of the black people in the film is drawn from events that occurred at the time, although not necessarily in relation to this investigation. The title itself comes from the FBI code name for the investigation, and some of the dialogue is drawn directly from their files. A lot of the fictional elements surround the actions of the two main FBI agents.

Coretta Scott King, widow of Martin Luther King Jr., boycotted the film, stating: &quot;How long will we have to wait before Hollywood finds the courage and the integrity to tell the stories of some of the many thousands of black men, women and children who put their lives on the line for equality?&quot; Myrlie Evers-Williams, the wife of slain civil rights activist Medgar Evers, said of the film: &quot;It was unfortunate that it was so narrow in scope that it did not show one black role model that today&#x27;s youth who look at the movie could remember.&quot; Benjamin Hooks, the executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), stated that the film, in its fictionalization of historical events, &quot;reeks with dishonesty, deception and fraud&quot; and portrays African Americans as &quot;cowed, submissive and blank-faced&quot;.

Carolyn Goodman, mother of Andrew Goodman, and Ben Chaney Jr., the younger brother of James Chaney, expressed that they were both &quot;disturbed&quot; by the film. Goodman felt that it &quot;used the deaths of the boys as a means of solving the murders and the FBI being heroes.&quot; Chaney stated, &quot;... the image that younger people got (from the film) about the times, about Mississippi itself and about the people who participated in the movement being passive, was pretty negative and it didn&#x27;t reflect the truth.&quot; Stephen Schwerner, brother of Michael Schwerner, felt that the film was &quot;terribly dishonest and very racist&quot; and &quot;[distorted] the realities of 1964&quot;.

On a Martin Luther King Jr. Day (January 16, 1989) episode of ABC&#x27;s late-night news program &quot;Nightline&quot;, Julian Bond, a social activist and leader in the Civil Rights Movement, nicknamed the film &quot;&quot;Rambo&quot; Meets the Klan&quot; and disapproved of its depiction of the FBI: &quot;People are going to have a mistaken idea about that time ... It&#x27;s just wrong. These guys were tapping our telephones, not looking into the murders of [Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner].&quot; When asked about the film at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, filmmaker Spike Lee criticized the lack of central African-American characters, believing the film was among several others that used a white savior narrative to exploit blacks in favor of depicting whites as heroes.

In response to these criticisms, Parker defended the film, stating that it was &quot;fiction in the same way that &quot;Platoon&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; are fictions of the Vietnam War. But the important thing is the heart of the truth, the spirit ... I defend the right to change it in order to reach an audience who knows nothing about the realities and certainly don&#x27;t watch PBS documentaries.&quot;

===Legal dispute===
On February 21, 1989, former Neshoba County sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey filed a lawsuit against Orion Pictures, claiming defamation and invasion of privacy. The lawsuit, filed at a United States district court in Meridian, Mississippi, asked for $8 million in damages. Rainey, who was the county sheriff at the time of the 1964 murders, alleged that the filmmakers of &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; portrayed him in an unfavorable light with the fictional character of Sheriff Ray Stuckey (Gailard Sartain). &quot;Everybody all over the South knows the one they have playing the sheriff in that movie is referring to me,&quot; he stated. &quot;What they said happened and what they did to me certainly wasn&#x27;t right and something ought to be done about it.&quot; Rainey&#x27;s lawsuit was unsuccessful; he dropped the suit after Orion&#x27;s team of lawyers threatened to prove that the film was based on fact, and that Rainey was indeed suspected in the 1964 murders.

===Accolades===
&quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; received various awards and nominations in categories ranging from recognition of the film itself to its writing, direction, editing, sound and cinematography, to the performances of Gene Hackman and Frances McDormand. It was named one of the &quot;Top 10 Films of 1988&quot; by the National Board of Review. The organization also awarded the film top honors at the 60th National Board of Review Awards: Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress.

In January 1989, the film received four Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama (Hackman), though it failed to win any of the awards at the 46th Golden Globe Awards. In February 1989, &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor; its closest rivals were &quot;Rain Man&quot; leading with eight nominations, and &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;, which also received seven nominations. On March 29, 1989, at the 61st Academy Awards, the film won only one of the seven awards for which it was nominated, Best Cinematography. At the 43rd British Academy Film Awards, the film received five nominations, ultimately winning for Best Sound, Best Cinematography and Best Editing.

<text>McClure is a village in Henry County, Ohio, United States. The population was 700 at the 2020 census.

==History==
McClure was laid out in the late 1870s, and named after John McClure, an original owner of the town site.

In the 1960s and the first half of the 1970s, McClure had the distinction of being the last place in Ohio with a manual telephone system. Since the installation of the first telephone system in the 1890s, by The Ohio Bell Telephone Co., residents used the same method to signal their town&#x27;s operator; they turned a crank on their phone. The operator in most cases knew their voice or knew the person being called.

When Ohio Bell refused to run lines to McClure&#x27;s rural residents, they formed a separate company, with volunteer labor used to build lines connecting the residents. The new company in 1908 bought the Bell equipment, and in 1909 changed its name to the Citizens Mutual Telephone Co. Long Distance calls were routed via Bell System equipment in Napoleon to the toll center in Maumee, and onward.

In the 1940s, the company opened a five-circuit toll line to Bowling Green, replacing the two-line circuit to Napoleon for long distance traffic. In the 1960s, realizing the need to modernize, the Citizens board began to consider selling the company. In February 1968, members of the Citizens Mutual Co. circulated a ballot asking members if they wished to modernize their system. In late 1969, the Citizen&#x27;s Mutual board voted to be acquired by Otto Miller of Liberty Center. Otto Miller renamed the company to its present name: McClure Telephone Company.

The Ohio Public Utilities Commission approved the $100,000 sale in August 1971. The company spent the next several years building a new central office and running new lines to its nearly 500 subscribers. In November 1975, McClure residents at last gave up their hand-cranked magneto telephones.
