<text>Bensalem Township is a township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The township borders the northeastern section of Philadelphia and includes the communities of Andalusia, Bensalem, Bridgewater, Cornwells Heights, Eddington, Flushing, Oakford, Siles, Trappe, and Trevose. Bensalem Township has no other incorporated municipalities within its boundaries. It is located within the Delaware Valley, also known as the Philadelphia metropolitan area.

As of the 2020 census, the township had a population of 62,707, which made it the most populous municipality in Bucks County and the ninth-most populated municipality in Pennsylvania.

The township, which was founded in 1692, is almost as old as Pennsylvania itself, which was founded in 1682.

==Origins==
The origin of the name Bensalem likely comes from references made by settler Joseph Growden, who named his estate &quot;Manor of Bensalem&quot; in honor of William Penn and the Semitic term for peace, Salem. It was originally named &quot;Salem&quot;; the first syllable &quot;Ben&quot; was added in 1701. Another theory notes the shared name with the utopian island in Francis Bacon&#x27;s New Atlantis, also named Bensalem.

==History==

The area of Bensalem Township appeared on the Holme Map of 1682, though not yet with a name. On January 2, 1685, the boundary was fixed between Bensalem and Philadelphia County along the Poquessing Creek. At the September 1692 session of Bucks County Court, a jury of thirteen men was formed to define boundaries of divisions that had been created up to that time. The report submitted in December states that &quot;All the lands between Neshamineh and Poquessin, and so to the upper side of Joseph Growden&#x27;s land in one and to be called &#x27;Salem.&#x27;&quot;

The first name of the township was Salem. The minutes of the Board of Property of the Province on November 19, 1701, at Philadelphia noted the name of the area as Bensalem. The population of the area was first a few Dutch and Swedes, then later a larger influx of English, and then additional Dutch settled the area.

<text>Bridgeton Township is a township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,277 at the 2010 census. The township was originally a part of adjacent Nockamixon Township, but a division was arranged and signed on May 24, 1890. This accord split an area of Nockamixon which ran west from the banks of the Delaware River to approximately one third the breadth of the original township. This smaller area was named &quot;Bridgeton&quot;, since it was the site of Upper Black Eddy–Milford Bridge covered wooden truss bridge built in 1842, which connected the towns of Upper Black Eddy, Pennsylvania and Milford, New Jersey. The original covered bridge was replaced by a truss bridge in 1933.

The township originally contained several tiny hamlets, such as the aforementioned Upper Black Eddy, Narrowsville, and Rupletown. Upper Black&#x27;s Eddy, as it was originally called, and Raubsville were named for notable landholders, while Narrowsville was named for a particularly thin portion of the Delaware River. With the construction of a centralized post office in Upper Black Eddy, the usage of separate names for the smaller towns ceased in an official capacity, and the everyday errands of residents became centered on the largest of the towns.

What little commercial trade exists in the township is now centered solely in Upper Black Eddy, with any evidence of there being any distinctive, smaller villages existing only on outdated road-signs and maps. Ringing Rocks Park is located within the township, as well as state game hunting lands. Bridgeton Township is also home to the Homestead General Store, the oldest continually operating general store on the Delaware Canal.

==Geography==

<text>Bristol is a borough in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located northeast of Center City in Philadelphia opposite Burlington, New Jersey, on the Delaware River.

Bristol was settled in 1681 and first incorporated in 1720. After 1834, it became very important to the development of the American Industrial Revolution as the terminus city of the Delaware Canal, providing greater Philadelphia with the day&#x27;s high quality anthracite coal from the Lehigh Canal via Easton. The canal and a short trip on the Delaware River also gave the town access to the mineral resources available in Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York via each of the Morris Canal, the Delaware and Hudson Canal, and the Delaware and Raritan Canal, and connected the community to those markets and trade from New York City.
Although its charter was revised in 1905, the original charter remains in effect, making it the third-oldest borough in Pennsylvania after Chester and Germantown. It had 7,104 residents in 1900; 9,256 in 1910; 10,273 in 1920; and 11,895 in 1940. The most recent 2010 census showed its population at 9,726. Its current mayor is Joseph A. Saxton. It is served by SEPTA&#x27;s Trenton Line.

Bristol is located southeast of Allentown and northeast of Philadelphia.

== History ==

Samuel Clift founded the Borough of Bristol, having received a land grant from Edmund Andros, who was then governor of New York. The grant became effective on March 14, 1681 (new style) or March 4, 1681 (old style) at the same time as William Penn&#x27;s Charter from Charles II became effective. Clift was required by the grant to maintain ferry service across the Delaware River to Burlington, New Jersey, and to run a public house or inn. The inn later became known as the &quot;George II&quot;.

Bristol Borough was settled in 1681, and named after Bristol, England. It was originally used as a port and dock. It is rich in history, with many historic and restored houses along the streets of Radcliffe and Mill. In 1697, the Pennsylvania Provincial Council ordered that a town be laid out in the location. A petition was submitted by Joseph Bond, Anthony Burton, John Hall and William Wharton to the Council for incorporation, and was granted in 1702.

Until 1725, Bristol Borough served as county seat of Bucks County.

From its earliest days, it was a center of textile mills, foundries, milling, and miscellaneous manufacturing. With the building of the long, forty feet wide, and five feet deep Delaware Canal, it became a transshipment gateway connecting the anthracite barges floating down the Lehigh Canal&#x27;s end terminal at Easton to Philadelphia. Bristol Borough was chosen to terminate the Delaware Canal because it already had regular shipping connections to other parts of Philadelphia and Delaware River ports by both the era&#x27;s typical animal powered barges and coastal/inland shipping vessels. Its docks also had regular ferry services to New Jersey and other points east from as early as 1681 until 1931. Developed by John Fitch, Bristol was the home of the first steamboat ferry service taking up to 30 passengers bound for Philadelphia and other ports on the Delaware

In 1740, William Davis established a shipyard in Bristol, building small vessels such as schooners and sloops. One such vessel was the &quot;Morning Glory&quot;, noted as the fastest sailing craft on the Delaware. In 1800, John Reed acquired the shipyard.

The expense of digging the canal was justifiable as the banks of the Delaware southerly from Easton were less suitable, there was insufficient real estate for extensive additional docks, so the legislature figured the Delaware Canal avoided the need to transship barge loads of coal to boats, drastically saving costs and time. Since Bristol Borough&#x27;s long established docks were accessible to the Delaware River, the town also became the Delaware Canal&#x27;s southern (main distribution) terminal end. Consequently, later, the Pennsylvania Railroad would also connect to the anthracite flowing through the canals, to the riverine barge and boat traffic, and to provide rail depots servicing the manufacturies. Even before the canal, Bristol Borough was located along a main land route to New York City, Trenton, and New England so with construction of the canal and railroads, it became a major center of transportation and an even more attractive location for industry.

By the 1880s, Bristol Borough was home to many factories, including companies manufacturing wall paper and carpet. In World War I, the Bristol Borough docks had sufficient space for a shipyard to construct twelve building slips for the construction of merchant vessels. In 1917 Averell Harriman organized the Bristol Borough shipyards founding the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation (later called Merchant-Sterling) and given the U-boat menace, would land a contract to build 40 identical cargo ships for the war. The residential area that developed around the shipyards was soon named Harriman, Pennsylvania, and most of the housing built therein is still in use today. In 1922 Harriman was annexed by Bristol Borough. Most of the shipping was finished too late to enter World War I, but some of the shipyard&#x27;s output was used post-war in relief and troop support missions. The majority of the contracts were canceled in 1919, and the ship yards rapidly became excess real estate. Between the two world wars, the eighty-acres of the shipyard were let out to various concerns, including one area converted to building amphibious planes—the flying boats technology which was the heart and soul of long distance air travel until the technological advances theretofore the middle years of World War II. During World War II the old shipyards were used to build those and other airplanes, but most of the manufacturing in WW-II was not directly related to the war.

In 1961, Bristol Borough gained national attention when the song &quot;Bristol Stomp&quot;, by The Dovells hit #2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart. The song remains a local favorite, and it is often played at ceremonies, parades, and sporting events. The Merchant Shipbuilding site returned to the news in the 1990s when the &quot;Bucks County Redevelopment Authority&quot; using state and federal funding targeted the area as a priority for urban redevelopment.
Given its riverfront location, the old shipbuilding site was ranked highest in priority, and on 20 October 2000 various legislators and officials held a press conference at the former shipyard heralding the construction of the residential development already under way, known as the&quot; &#x27;Riverfront North Project&quot;&#x27;, and publicizing how derelict portions of the slipways were being removed. The project also established a park with four monuments celebrating the town&#x27;s past in the redevelopment.
Today the preserved elements of the shipyard, and other buildings once important in Bristol Borough&#x27;s past service are enshrined and celebrated in the Bristol Historic District, Bristol Industrial Historic District, and tourism sites celebrating the town&#x27;s history and rich ethnic diversity. Various annual festivals, in particular keep a multi-ethnic cultural identity alive and well.
Historic sites in the town including the Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal, Dorrance Mansion, General Stores and Mold Loft Building-Harriman Yard of the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation, Grundy Mill Complex, Harriman Historic District, Jefferson Avenue School and Jefferson Land Association Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal is also designated as a National Historic Landmark District.

<text>Chalfont is a borough with home rule status in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 4,253 at the 2020 census. The borough is served by SEPTA Regional Rail&#x27;s Lansdale/Doylestown Line at Chalfont station.

Chalfont is named after Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire, England. Chalfont was the home of William Penn&#x27;s first wife, and William Penn is buried at Jordans Quaker Meeting House near Chalfont St Giles.

==History==
In 1720, Simon Butler bought over 150 acres of land, including the &quot;Village of Chalfont.&quot; After the construction of his home and mill, Butler bought more than 400 more acres of land. Butler was a giant historical figure who acted as a legal and economic powerhouse in the area. After his death, the land was parceled to a number of people. Between then and 1901 Chalfont held several names, including Butler&#x27;s Mill, Kungle&#x27;s Tavern, Barndtsville, and Whitehallville. For many years, the most important building in the area was the tavern and public house, which has burnt down many times and now stands as Leonardo&#x27;s Pizza. During the Victorian era in 1855, a train station was built along the newly constructed Doylestown Branch of the North Penn Railroad which helped the community grow and brought about the construction of the many Victorian-style houses.

In 1885, Chalfont established Forest Park. Forest Park began as a small picnic grounds with frequent live music. The construction of the train station assured the park&#x27;s success. In time, the grounds grew to become a small amusement park where locals could enjoy rides, a large swimming pool built in the 1930s, music (including string bands in the 1940s), and a host for many company picnics. The park closed its doors forever in 1968.

George Eckhart later owned the Butler&#x27;s mill. After it burned in 1835, Eckhart rebuilt with a larger mill. Later, Eckhart&#x27;s son Martin inherited the mill and his other son inherited the farm. Part of the farmland included woods of mostly oak locally known as Eckhart&#x27;s Grove which was frequently used for dance parties, family gatherings, religious camp meetings and Sunday School picnics. Later, in 1885, the mill was owned by Philip B. Grove who leased it to Valentine B. Clymer and Matthew S. Cogan when it burned again and was never rebuilt. Another gristmill was built in 1793 not far from where Bulter&#x27;s mill was first operated by men named Miller and Evans, later by Francis D. Hartzel. Two of Hartzel&#x27;s sons succeeded him. After a fire in 1878, the mill was rebuilt and much of the machinery replaced. About 1761, Henry Lewis built a stone tavern operated by George Kungle during the Revolutionary period. Chalfont was known as Kungles Tavern. After Kungle, the tavern was later owned consecutively by James Morris, Lewis Morris, Abner Morris, then John Barndt from Tylersport. The village was then known as Barndtsville.

William Stevens had a store on the south bank of the West Branch Neshaminy Creek and opened a post office in 1845. Chalfont was then known as Whitehallville. In 1869, the North Penn changed the name of the station to Chalfont. Sometime before 1885, the farm inherited by Charles Eckhart was purchased by Isaac Funk. On 27 June 1885, Funk opened the Forest Park on the grounds of the Eckhart&#x27;s Grove. Guest speakers were attorneys from Doylestown J. Freeman Hendricks and John D. James. Music was provided by the Chalfont Cornet Band. On 20 June 1778, detachments of George Washington&#x27;s army passed through the West Branch Neshaminy Creek and the North Branch Neshaminy Creek as they travelled from their camp at Valley Forge to Monmouth.

==Passenger trains==
===History===
Churchville&#x27;s population boom and growth as a commuter haven took place in the mid-1980s, just after the town lost its commuter railway line. Trains served the town until January 14, 1983 via SEPTA&#x27;s Fox Chase-Newtown Rapid Transit Line. The station, and all of those north of Fox Chase, were closed due to failing diesel train equipment that the then-cash-strapped SEPTA could not afford to rehabilitate. As a result, ridership was low and the service cancelled on a &quot;temporary&quot; basis. As such, Churchville Station still appears in SEPTA&#x27;s publicly posted tariffs.

Although rail service was initially replaced with a Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus, patronage remained light. The traveling public never saw a bus service as a suitable replacement for a rail service, and the Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus service ended in 1999.

The Churchville Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.

===Resumption of passenger train service===
In the ensuing years since 1983, there has been heavy interest by both residents and politicians in resuming passenger service to Churchville.

In September 2009, the Southampton-based Pennsylvania Transit Expansion Coalition (PA-TEC) began discussions with township officials along the railway, as well as SEPTA officials, about the realistic possibility of resuming even minimal passenger service to relieve traffic congestion in the region. Plans call for completing the electrification to Newtown, as originally planned in the late 1970s.

PA-TEC&#x27;s efforts have received overwhelming bipartisan support by both Bucks and Montgomery County officials, as well as at the state level, despite SEPTA&#x27;s overall reservations. However, SEPTA has also confirmed they are willing to reestablish regular commuter service if strong political support exists in both counties.

==Sights==
The Churchville Nature Center, operated by the facility of the Bucks County Department of Parks and Recreation, protects 65 acres of wildlife preserve. The center features a visitor center with exhibits, a reptile room, a recreated 1500s Lenape village, a seasonal native butterfly house, gardens and 2 miles of trails.

<text>Doylestown is a borough in and the county seat of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 census, the borough population was 8,300.

Doylestown is located northwest of Trenton, north of Center City Philadelphia, and southeast of Allentown. It is part of the Delaware Valley, also known as the Philadelphia metropolitan area.

== History ==

Like most of eastern Pennsylvania, present-day Doylestown was inhabited by the Lenape Indian tribe prior to European settlement of the region.

===18th century===
In March 1745, William Doyle, an Irish settler, obtained a license to build a tavern, then known as William Doyle&#x27;s Tavern, on what is now the northwest corner of Dyers Road and Coryell&#x27;s Ferry Road at present-day Main and State Streets. The tavern&#x27;s strategic location at the junction of present-day U.S. Route 202, which links Norristown and New Hope, and Pennsylvania Route 611, which links Philadelphia and Easton, contributed to Doylestown&#x27;s early growth. 

A second inn, named Sign of the Ship, was established in 1774, built diagonally across from the Doyle Tavern. Samuel Flack was innkeeper in 1778.

===19th century===
On January 1, 1802, a post office was established in present-day Doylestown. Charles Stewart, the first postmaster, carried letters to recipients in the bell-shaped crown of his high beaver hat as he walked about the village. When Stewart died on February 7, 1804, his son-in-law Enoch Harvey became the next postmaster. On October 9, 1804 Harvey advertised in the &quot;Pennsylvania Correspondent&quot;, published in Doylestown, of a list of letters remaining in the post office for Wm. R. Hanna, Esq., Newtown; Doct. Felix Robertson, Bucks County; Robert Wehir, Shamony, Bucks County; Robert A. Farmer, Esq., Birdsborough; Israel Childs, Buckingham.

In 1815, the first church was erected; it was followed by the construction of a succession of churches for various congregations throughout the 19th century.

As the population of Central and Upper Bucks County grew throughout the 18th and into the 19th century, discontent developed with the county seat&#x27;s location in Newtown, where it had been since 1725. Eight petitions with a total of 184 signers were submitted to the General Assembly, some as early as 1784, requesting the move of the county seat to Doylestown. Among the signers were Andrew Armstrong, John Armstrong, John Davis, Andrew Denison, Jesse Fell, Joseph Fell, John Ingham (of Ingham Springs), Michael Frederick Kolb, Zebulon M. Pike (of Lumberton), Samuel Preston, Robert Shewell, Walter Shewell, and Fulkerd Sebring. 

The Pennsylvania General Assembly approved the move by an Act on February 28, 1810, and the first Court session was opened on May 11, 1813. An outgrowth of Doylestown&#x27;s new courthouse was the development of &quot;lawyers row&quot;, a collection of Federal-style offices. One positive consequence of early 19th-century investment in the new county seat was organized fire protection, which began in 1825 with the Doylestown Fire Engine Company.

A bill to erect Doylestown into a borough was introduced into Legislature in February 1830, but failed, as well as a second attempt in the session of 1832. &quot;An Act to erect the Village of Doylestown, in the County of Bucks, into a Borough&quot; was passed and signed into law by Governor Joseph Ritner on April 16, 1838.

An electric telegraph station was built in 1846, and the North Pennsylvania Railroad completed a branch to Doylestown in 1856. The first gas lights were introduced in 1854. Because of the town&#x27;s relatively high elevation and a lack of strong water power, substantial industrial development never occurred and Doylestown evolved to have a professional and residential character.

During the mid-19th century, several large tracts located east of the courthouse area were subdivided into neighborhoods. The next significant wave of development occurred after the Civil War, when the Magill property to the southwest of the town&#x27;s core was subdivided for residential lots.

In 1869, Doylestown established a water works. The first telephone line arrived in 1878, the same year that a new courthouse was erected. 1897 saw the first of several trolley lines connecting Doylestown with Willow Grove, Newtown, and Easton. A private sewer system and treatment plant were authorized in 1903. The borough took over and expanded sewer service to about three-quarters of the town in 1921.

===20th century===
In the early 20th century, Doylestown became best known to the outside world through the &quot;Tools of the Nation-Maker&quot; museum of the Bucks County Historical Society. Henry Chapman Mercer constructed the reinforced concrete building in 1916 to house his collection of mechanical tools and utensils. Upon his death in 1930, Mercer also left his similarly constructed home Fonthill and adjacent Moravian Pottery and Tile Works, to be operated as a museum. The home was left on the condition that his housekeeper be allowed to live there for the rest of her life. She lived there and gave tours until the mid-1970s.

In 1916, Doylestown Country Club was established and still operates a private golf course and caddy program.

By 1931, the advent of the automobile and improved highway service had put the last trolley line out of business as Doylestonians used the automobile as the primary means of travel within the region. The Great Depression took its toll on Doylestown; many grand old houses constructed a century earlier fell into disrepair. During the 1930s, the borough also expanded its land area to the north by admission of the tract known as the Doylestown Annex.

In the decade following World War II, however, Doylestown&#x27;s business community boomed. During the 1940s, streets were paved for the first time in two decades and parking meters were introduced downtown in 1948. However, the postwar housing boom did not begin in earnest until the 1950s, when 550 new homes were built. The housing boom continued into the 1960s and 1970s, as more than 1,600 new homes were built during those decades and the borough&#x27;s population grew from 5,917 in 1960 to 8,717 in 1980.

By the 1960s, the competition presented by the emergence of shopping malls proved detrimental to many local Doylestown businesses, resulting in vacant buildings and dilapidated storefronts. Bucks County Redevelopment Authority responded with a federal urban renewal scheme that called for the demolition of 27 historic buildings. The local business community objected to such wholesale clearance and responded with its own plan called Operation &#x27;64, the Doylestown Plan for Self-Help Downtown Renewal. This private initiative was successful in saving Doylestown&#x27;s old buildings and historic character, while improving business at the same time. One historic landmark that could not be saved was the 80-year-old courthouse and clock tower, which was replaced by the present county complex in the early 1960s.

By the end of the 1980s, the downtown business district was again showing the toll of massive new competition from the latest wave of suburban shopping centers, as well as the recession that hit hardest in the northeastern states. In response, the borough council established a volunteer group of civic-minded representatives from business organizations, government, and the residential community to begin formulating plans for the downtown area in 1992. This effort resulted in streetscape improvements composed of cast iron street lamps and brick pavers, façade improvements and other beautification efforts, and the establishment of a Main Street Manager Program.

In the 1990s, the downtown area rebuilt itself largely by turning to an out-of-town audience. Doylestown had long been respected as a bucolic tourist destination. The gentry of Philadelphia and New York City, including figures associated with theater and literary in Manhattan, maintained country estates in the area and often summered in Doylestown. The Mercer Museum, Moravian Pottery and Tile Works, and the local National Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa brought a regular stream of short-term visitors through the area as well.

With charitable support, the County Theater, an art-deco-styled building, was restored and reopened showing art-house fare, and a new main library and art museum were built around the ruins of the old stone jail, across the street from the Mercer Museum. Doylestown also was designated an official resort town and was exempted from liquor license caps. Empty commercial spaces soon began to be replaced with dense and vibrant bars and restaurants, contributing to a lively nightlife in Doylestown.

As the Philadelphia metropolitan area expanded from southern into central Bucks County, the fields and farms of the communities around Doylestown quickly began to sprout housing developments. This development brought thousands of people to the area, but the neighborhoods created often lacked longstanding institutions or discernible centers. Doylestown, more centrally located than the Delaware River border town of New Hope, which had traditionally served this function, was able to position itself as the regional center of culture and nightlife.

Archival collection and community programming are two functions of the Doylestown Historical Society, established in 1995, whose mission is &quot;to commemorate and preserve the history of Doylestown so that its people, places and events may long be remembered.&quot;

The Doylestown Historic District, Pugh Dungan House, Fonthill, Fountain House, Oscar Hammerstein II Farm, James-Lorah House, Mercer Museum, Moravian Pottery and Tile Works, and Shaw Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="131522" wikidata="Q1894407" url="?curid=131522" title="Falls Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania">
<text>Falls Township is a suburban Philadelphia township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 34,300 at the 2010 census. Portions of Fairless Hills and Levittown, Pennsylvania, are located in the township. Portions of Falls Township are called Morrisville and Yardley, due to the location of the Morrisville Post Office outside the Borough of Morrisville in Falls Township. As originally chartered in 1692, the villages of Morrisville and Tullytown were part of Falls Township. Morrisville was granted borough status in 1804. Tullytown was established as a borough in 1891.

==History==
Dutch settlements here were established as early as 1616. A number of colonists came to Falls Township before William Penn founded Pennsylvania in 1681, including William Biles.

Fallsington is the only settlement of this period which has been in continuous use. Fallsington is an example of a crossroads village typical of the time. The Bucks County Courthouse, established in 1663, is said to have been located in Fallsington until it was moved to Bristol in 1705. The Friends Meeting, whose first meetings were held at the home of William Biles on Biles Island, found a site for a brick meeting house, built about 1690 in Fallsington on of land that had been donated by Samuel Burges. Also in 1690, Thomas Janney donated of land to be used as the Quaker burial grounds for Falls Monthly Meeting. William Penn donated a tract of , for a Falls commons. The township itself was established in 1692. Numerous villages were located within the township, with Fallsington being the center of social and commercial activity in the township. Morrisville was another prominent village, until it was partitioned as a borough in 1804. Tullytown was also a village until it was partitioned as a borough in 1891.

Villages and other place names, past and present, include Dogtown, Fairless Hills, Fallsington, Kildorpy, Kirkbridesville, Levittown, Morningside, Oxford Valley (located in both Falls Township and Middletown Township, Penns Manor, Penn Valley, Slickville, Tyburn, and Wheatsheaf.

The growth of Fallsington continued, with the construction of homes, an inn, public buildings, stores, and small craftsmen&#x27;s shops. Until the construction of Fairless Hills and Levittown, it was the largest village in the township, and functioned for many years as a commercial center.

In 1682, William Penn began construction of his official residence, Pennsbury Manor. The site in Falls Township was chosen for its easy access to Philadelphia along the Delaware River. This island was gradually sold by Penn&#x27;s heirs and the last original building was destroyed in 1864. In 1932, a small portion of the original site was purchased by Pennsylvania and reconstruction of Pennsbury Manor was begun. Pennsbury is now a historical site, open to the public. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.

The proximity of major transportation systems influenced much of the township&#x27;s development. The earliest of these was the Delaware River. The township is located at the upper end of the navigable portion of the river. In 1686, the Provincial Council ordered the construction of the King&#x27;s Highway, which ran from Philadelphia to Trenton along an existing Indian trail, through Bristol, Falls, and Morrisville. The King&#x27;s Highway still exists today as U.S. Route 13, flowing closely the original configuration. Additional roads and turnpikes were built in the 18th and early 19th centuries.

Other transportation systems were laid out through Falls Township in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Delaware Canal from Easton to Bristol was opened in 1832. A railroad line from Philadelphia to Trenton via Morrisville was built between 1833 and 1835. The rail line became part of Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s main New York-Philadelphia line. The &quot;West Trenton&quot; cut-off of the Pennsylvania Railroad was built through the northern part of the township at the end of 19th century. These rail lines now accommodate SEPTA, Amtrak and Conrail passenger and freight between Philadelphia and Trenton.

<text>Ivyland is a borough in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is known for one of the finest collections of Victorian buildings in the state, most of which are registered with the National Register of Historic Places. The population was 1,041 at the 2010 census, a 111.6% increase from the 2000 census.

The east end of Ivyland was once a separate village named Bradyville.

==History==
Ivyland was founded in 1873 by Edwin Lacey, a Quaker who was related to John Lacey, a brigadier general in the American Revolution. Edwin Lacey purchased of land between Jacksonville Road (today&#x27;s PA 332) and the Reading Company&#x27;s future New Hope rail line, today&#x27;s New Hope Railroad, which was completed to New Hope in 1891. It, as well as a large hotel which was planned for the town, was intended to serve the centennial of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

According to the borough&#x27;s website, Edwin Lacey, who apparently was no botanist, named the town for the vast amount of &quot;ivy&quot; growing in the area, which turned out to be poison ivy.

The railroad line from the county line to Bristol Road opened November 9, 1874. Samuel Davis quarried the stone for the bed and for a bridge over a local stream, supplied horses and carts for the grading, and boarded the construction workers. In return, he took payment as stocks and bonds, and was also offered a lifetime pass on the railroad. He is reported to have stated &quot;I never knew dividends to be paid out of passes. I have asked friends to put their money in this railroad, promising them interest on their investment, and I can&#x27;t let them down. Furthermore, if I cannot afford to pay my way on the train, I had better stay home.&quot;

The first post office was opened October 26, 1889, Wilmer Carr, postmaster.

Ivyland was incorporated as a borough in 1903.

Passenger rail service was cut off in 1952 by the Reading, which later sold that portion of the rail line to the New Hope and Ivyland Railroad in 1966.

<text>Langhorne Borough, formerly known as Attleboro, is a borough in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,643 at the time of the 2020 census.

The mailing address &quot;Langhorne&quot; is used for Langhorne Borough, but it is also used broadly to describe the majority of surrounding Middletown Township, which for the most part uses Langhorne&#x27;s ZIP code of 19047. Sesame Place, while physically located in Middletown Township, has Langhorne as its mailing address. The Langhorne post office also services the northeastern part of Lower Southampton Township, which uses the ZIP code 19053.

Langhorne Borough is approximately six miles west of the Delaware River.

Langhorne Manor is a separate borough that borders Langhorne Borough proper to the south.

==History==
Langhorne began in the 17th century at the intersection of older Lenni-Lenape paths. The earliest established settlers (three Dutch and two British) arrived in the early 18th century. One of the area&#x27;s first notable residents was Joseph Richardson, who established a store and inn in the 1730s. The road from Bristol grew into a very important transportation center between Trenton and Philadelphia in the later 18th century and 19th centuries, with trade and travelers contributing to the economic growth of the area. Langhorne eventually became the stagecoach transportation hub of Bucks County, transporting people between Trenton and Philadelphia and was then known as Four Lanes End, later known as Richardsons Corner.

The first mention of Attleborough was recorded on a deed in the Recorder&#x27;s Office, Deed Book 6, page 210, November 7, 1737. Isaac Hicks laid out a plan for &quot;Washington&#x27;s Square in Attleborough&quot; in November 1783. Historian William J. Buck wrote &quot;A resident of the place has informed me that this name is of local origin; that a William Richardson Atlee (son of Colonel Samuel Atlee of the Revolutionary Army), a lawyer and son-in-law of General Wayne, resided here about 1790 or perhaps a little earlier. A fire engine was ordered to be made, for which £50 had been raised. When it was finished, word was sent from Philadelphia inquiring what name they wanted it called. Someone suggested that, as Mr. Atlee had been one of the principal contributors, it should be called after him. When the engine arrived, it was found to have painted on its sides Atleebury, which still to be seen. Shortly afterwards a post office was established here, when it was called Attleborough, a slight change from the original.&quot; However, the post office was not established until April 1, 1806, Richard Croasdale, the first postmaster.

The village became known as Attleborough until 1876, when it was incorporated and named for Jeremiah Langhorne, an early resident of the area and former chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Upon the arrival of the railroad in 1876, residents of Attleborough and Hulmeville disputed over what the name of the station should be. The president of the North Pennsylvania Railroad, Franklin A. Comly, settled the matter by name the station The Penndel Train Station, until recently changing it to Langhorne Train Station. 

A school of higher learning was established in 1835 named successively Minerva Seminary, Attleborough High School, Attleboro Academy, and Bellevue Institute. Samuel J. Randall of Philadelphia, a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1875 to 1890 and speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1876 to 1881, attended this educational institute.

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Langhorne continued to grow as wealthy Philadelphians constructed large homes and businesses along Maple and Bellevue Avenues. 

The Langhorne Historic District, former Langhorne Library, Joseph Richardson House, and Tomlinson-Huddleston House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Langhorne was the base of eGames, the publisher of the cult classic &quot;Speedy Eggbert&quot;.

<text>Levittown is a census-designated place (CDP) and planned community in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the Philadelphia metropolitan area. The population was 52,699 at the 2020 census, down from 52,983 at the 2010 census. 

Levittown is above sea level. Though not a municipality, it is sometimes recognized as the largest suburb of Philadelphia while Upper Darby, Lower Merion, Bensalem, Abington, and Bristol townships are municipalities larger in size within the three surrounding Pennsylvania counties. Starting with land purchased in 1951, it was planned and built by Levitt &amp; Sons. The brothers William Levitt and architect Alfred Levitt designed its six typical houses.

Levittown is located southeast of Allentown and northeast of Philadelphia.

== History ==

Most of the land on which Levittown is built was purchased in 1951. Levitt and Sons only built six models of houses in Levittown, all single-family dwellings with lawns: the Levittowner, the Rancher, the Jubilee, the Pennsylvanian, the Colonial and the Country Clubber, with only modest exterior variations within each model. The homes were moderately priced and required only a low down payment. 

Construction of Levittown began in February 1952, soon after completion of Levittown, New York, located on Long Island. Levittown, Pennsylvania, was the second &quot;Levittown&quot; built by William J. Levitt, who is often credited as the creator of the modern American suburb. 

To speed up construction, Levitt &amp; Sons perfected a 26-step rationalized building method that was essentially an assembly line type of home building. The house remained stationary while construction workers moved from site to site, each repeatedly performing a task such as pouring foundations, putting up pre-fabricated walls, installing plumbing, or doing electrical work. At peak production, this highly regimented process enabled Levitt&#x27;s workers to produce a finished house every sixteen minutes. Construction of the homes commenced in 1952 and when completed in 1958, 17,311 homes had been built.

What set Levittown apart from other developments at the time was that it was built as a complete community. Levitt &amp; Sons designed neighborhoods with traffic-calming curvilinear roads, in which there were no four-way intersections. Each neighborhood had within its boundaries a site donated by Levitt &amp; Sons for a public elementary school. Locations for churches and other public facilities were set aside on main thoroughfares such as the Levittown Parkway, likewise donated by the builder to religious groups and other organizations. 

Other amenities included Olympic-sized public pools, parks, greenbelts, baseball fields and playgrounds, and a shopping center located in neighboring Tullytown borough that was considered large and modern at the time of its construction (and in fact was the largest east of the Mississippi). The first set of four sample homes were put on display in a swatch of land near the future Levittown Shop-a-Rama, and an estimated 30,000 people viewed them in that first weekend.

Residents, who are sometimes called Levittowners, were first expected to comply with a lengthy list of rules and regulations regarding the upkeep of their homes and use of their property. Two of these &quot;rules&quot; included a prohibition on hanging laundry out to dry on Sunday and not allowing homeowners to fence off their yards. These proved unenforceable over time, particularly when backyard pools became financially accessible to the working class and privacy concerns drove many to fence off their yards. In the years since Levitt &amp; Sons ended construction, three- and four-story &quot;garden apartments&quot; and a number of non-Levitt owner-occupied houses have been built in Levittown.

William Levitt had a career-long commitment to a whites-only policy in their developments. Levitt &amp; Sons would not sell homes to African Americans. Levitt did not consider himself to be a racist, considering housing and racial relations entirely separate matters. Initially, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) conditioned essential financing for this and similar projects on the restriction of home sales to those of &quot;the Caucasian race&quot;, as stipulated in housing rent and sales agreements and deed covenants. This did not prevent Bea and Lew Wechsler, a Jewish couple from the Bronx, from connecting an African-American family to a neighbor who desired to sell his home. Levittown&#x27;s first Black couple, William and Daisy Myers, bought a home in the Dogwood Hollow section in 1957. Their move to Levittown was marked with racist harassment and mob violence, which required intervention by state authorities. This led to an injunction and criminal charges against the harassers while the Myerses and their supporters refused to surrender and received national acclaim for their efforts. For instance, Daisy Myers has been hailed as &quot;The Rosa Parks of the North&quot;, who helped expose the northern states&#x27; problems with racial inequality of that time. Daisy Myers later wrote a book about her family&#x27;s experiences. She died Dec. 5, 2011, in York, Pa. The NAACP and the ACLU opposed Levitt’s racist policies, and the Federal Housing Administration threatened to refuse mortgages on his next Levittown. Levitt still refused to sell to blacks, and developed plans for yet another whites-only Levittown—this one to be in Willingboro Township, N.J.—while fighting legal challenges in New Jersey courts. Ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear his case. 
The community&#x27;s otherwise placid exterior was again disturbed during the so-called suburban gas riots of June 1979 in the wake of the Camp David Peace Accords, which resulted in a second embargo by Arab oil-producing nations. The unrest occurred June 24–25, 1979, as lines swelled and tempers flared in the heart of Levittown at an intersection known as Five Points, a location then surrounded by six service stations, two of which were severely damaged by vandalism in the riots. The two days of riots made national headlines and were mentioned (although not directly by name) in the draft of an address to the nation that was to have been delivered by President Jimmy Carter on July 5, 1979.

A baseball team from Levittown won the Little League World Series in 1960. Levittown American beat an opponent from Fort Worth, Texas, to win the honor.

Of the five public pools built by Levitt &amp; Sons and operated by the Levittown Public Recreation Association (LPRA), four were closed in 2002, with the exception being one located in the Pinewood section. LPRA Headquarters (and other landmarks) of this prototypical post-war suburb of sometimes mythic importance have been the focus of historic preservation efforts. Since 2002, studies have been underway to establish the Levittown Historic District.

Since its inception in 1988, the Bucks County St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade has been held in Levittown. Every year, the parade steps off from St Joseph the Worker Church, and proceeds two miles (3 km) on New Falls Road to Conwell-Egan Catholic High School. St Joseph the Worker Church has since been torn down.

=== Tullytown ===

Levittown is not an incorporated place, though efforts in the early 1950s were made to incorporate. Some Levittown residents feared that incorporation would lead to higher taxes, by robbing the prospective municipality of a commercial tax base.

&quot;Levittown Shop-a-Rama&quot;, the 1955 Levittown Shopping Center in Tullytown was a 60-acre L-shaped pedestrian mall at the edge rather than the center of Levittown, with two strips of stores faced the 6,000-car parking lot with a courtyard that had green spaces, benches, and entrances to the stores. The center&#x27;s largest, anchor department store (Pomeroys, which was acquired by Boscov&#x27;s) and other chain retailers such as Food Fair, Woolworth&#x27;s, JC Penney, Kresges, Yards, Lobel&#x27;s, W.T. Grant, Pep Boys, and Sears were Levitt-favored tenants.

The shopping center began a slow decline in the mid-1970s from which it never recovered with the building of the Oxford Valley Mall. The mall, located just north of Levittown, in Langhorne in Middletown Township, drew shoppers away from the older Levittown facility, given Oxford Valley&#x27;s much larger size and enclosed shopping environment. In 2002, the redeveloped site of the Shop-a-rama was reopened as the Levittown Town Center. The completed facility contains of retail space.

Levittown&#x27;s 41 neighborhoods (locally called &quot;sections&quot;) are found in parts of four separate municipalities: 
* Bristol Township (including the sections of Plumbridge, Mill Creek Falls, Indian Creek, Goldenridge, Blue Ridge, Whitewood, Orangewood, Yellowood, Violetwood, Red Cedar Hill, Apple Tree Hill, Holly Hill, Crabtree Hollow, Oaktree Hollow, Greenbrook, Farmbrook, Dogwood Hollow, Junewood, Magnolia Hill, and most of Kenwood and Stonybrook, and a small part of Birch Valley)
* Falls Township (including the sections of Vermilion Hill, Thornridge, Elderberry Pond, Willowood, North Park, as well as portions of Pinewood, Lakeside, most of Birch Valley and 1 house in Magnolia Hill)
* Middletown Township (including the sections of Deep Dale East, Deep Dale West, Highland Park, Twin Oaks, Forsythia Gate, Snowball Gate, Red Rose Gate, Upper Orchard, Lower Orchard, Juniper Hill, Cobalt Ridge and Quincy Hollow)
* Borough of Tullytown (including small portions of Stonybrook, Kenwood, Pinewood and Lakeside). These neighborhoods&#x27; populations are counted by the U.S. Census Bureau as residing within Tullytown only, not the Levittown CDP.

The names of the streets within each section uniformly begin with the same letter that begins the name of the section in question except for the section of Green Lynne, which was not constructed by Bill Levitt. This plan offers a good clue as to where any particular street might be located. &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; are not used for section or street names. As there are more than 24 section names, &quot;road&quot; is used for street names in sections to the west of Edgely Road, &quot;lane&quot; is used in those section to the east. Sections are surrounded by a &quot;drive&quot; with the same name as the section. For example, the Pinewood section is circled by Pinewood Drive, while Snowball Gate is surrounded by Snowball Drive. Some sections have their drive broken into multiple parts, with similar names. Forsythia Gate has Forsythia Drive North and Forsythia Drive South.

Almost all other roads or lanes in the sections connect on one or both ends to the drive of that section. In some sections, such as Goldenridge, the shape of the section prevents the drive from surrounding the section, or allowing all roads in the section from connecting to the drive. The drives of adjacent sections, are frequently connected with small connector streets. In addition, small connector streets are used to connect the section drive with a nearby main thoroughfare. The names of these small connectors typically start with one of the letters from the adjacent sections, and tend to have a name reminiscent of their purpose or their location. Some examples: Learning Lane connects Lakeside and Pinewood, and borders Walt Disney Elementary School. Short Lane connects Stoneybrook and Farmbrook. Not all small connector streets are named.

Red Rose Gate, Forsythia Gate, and Snowball Gate are collectively known as &quot;The Gates.&quot; (These were the only sections without sidewalks so as to lend a more &quot;executive&quot; appearance to the neighborhoods.) Lakeside sits next to Levittown Lake. Thornridge has its upper half that sits on a ridge, that was found to have Thorn Bushes. Vermilion Hill is named after the color that the trees on its prominent hill turned in the Fall. Magnolia Hill is on a prominent hill. Mill Creek Falls is found next to a creek by the same name.

==Education==
Middletown residents are served by public schools run by the Neshaminy School District. Bristol Township public schools are managed by the Bristol Township School District. Falls Township and Tullytown Borough residents are served by the Pennsbury School District.

Some students attend schools run by Catholic, Lutheran, evangelical Protestant and Quaker organizations, in and around Levittown.

<doc id="131531" wikidata="Q117746" url="?curid=131531" title="Lower Makefield Township, Pennsylvania">
<text>Lower Makefield Township is a township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. Lower Makefield Township is located in the Delaware Valley and borders the Delaware River and New Jersey to its north and east. Most addresses in the township have a Yardley address; the township surrounds the borough of Yardley on its north, south, and west.

Neighboring towns and cities in New Jersey are Hopewell Township, Ewing Township, and Trenton. Additionally, the township borders Upper Makefield Township, Newtown Township, Pennsylvania, Middletown Township, Pennsylvania, Falls Township, and Morrisville, and as mentioned above, surrounds Yardley Borough on three sides.

As of the 2010 census, the population of Lower Makefield Township was 32,559, not including Yardley Borough, and it ranked first in Pennsylvania for both median household and median family income (for places with a population over 10,000); however, it ranked 78th overall in the United States (between Westfield, New Jersey and Moraga, California) for median household income, but non-census 2006 data indicates that since the 2000 census, it moved up to 31st for median household income (between Wellesley, Massachusetts and Rye, New York), and ninth for disposable household income, due to relatively low taxes and extremely low house prices compared to other peer, very-high-income towns. Living expenses are lower than in the bordering Ewing Township, New Jersey, though Ewing&#x27;s median household income is nearly half and it has a crime rate many times higher.

Lower Makefield is the largest municipality (by population) in North America without its own municipal court or post office. The municipal court serving Lower Makefield is in Morrisville (the town bordering the township to the southeast), and there are no plans to change the arrangements with Morrisville. The post office, while retaining the name of Morrisville, is located within Falls Township in which some of the township is served by the same ZIP code (19067). Previously Morrisville had a higher population, but with the growth in Lower Makefield over the past 30 years, Morrisville is now a much smaller place by both land area and population.

Lower Makefield Township has been a top finisher in the &quot;MONEY Magazine&quot; and CNN/Money &quot;Best Places to Live&quot; rankings for the Eastern region of the United States in the under 100,000 population category.

==History==

The Dolington Village Historic District, John and Phineas Hough House, Amos Palmer House, Slate Hill Cemetery, Benjamin Taylor Homestead, and Village of Edgewood Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 18.3 square miles (47.4 km2), of which 17.9 square miles (46.5 km2) is land and 0.4 square mile (0.9 km2) (1.97%) is water. Past and present villages include Schammels Corner, and Woodside.

Natural features include Brock Creek, Common Creek, Core Creek, Edge Hill, and Jericho Creek.

==Development and growth==
Lower Makefield has experienced explosive growth over the past decades; however, the housing crisis severely hit the township during the 2000s, and development slowed considerably, resulting in a slight population decrease. The decrease is credited to the many college-aged students leaving the township bound for college. The housing boom of the nineties resulted in a large increase in the adolescent population, who have since reached adulthood and left the township.
Still many smaller housing developments and some corporate centers have been constructed since 2000, the latter especially the Stony Hill Road corridor around I-295, beginning with office complexes 1000 to 1040 Stony Hill Road in 1998, followed by 600 to 800 Township Line Road (at Township Line and Stony Hill), 777 Township Line Road (the first green building in Bucks County), and a new age-restricted housing complex under construction at 645 Stony Hill Road, near the township&#x27;s retail district. However, the township has been well-planned and maintains a strong balance between growth and preservation, and is considered to be very desirable for the high quality of life it offers residents.

On December 19, 2007, a committee was formed to work to bring a veterans&#x27; monument to Lower Makefield Township. On October 15, 2008, the Lower Makefield Supervisors unanimously approved designating the site of the farmers&#x27; market (known as Pocket Park) as a veterans&#x27; monument. On November 9, Pocket Park was officially renamed Veterans Square. The veterans committee has committed to not taking township tax dollars to build the monument and relies on contributions. The park will remain open space for use as a community farmers&#x27; market, playground, and monument.

In the September 11th attacks on the twin towers in New York City, Lower Makefield Township lost six residents, including the captain of United Airlines Flight 175, the highest number in Pennsylvania, which lost a total of 29 tower employees. This high concentration is most likely due to the large number of Manhattan commuters who live there. The Garden of Reflection Memorial in Lower Makefield went into development shortly after the attacks as a dedication to the 17 Bucks County residents who died in the attacks, and it also honors all of the 2,973 victims who lost their lives. The State of Pennsylvania has selected The Garden of Reflection as the Official Pennsylvania 9-11 Memorial, and it was formally dedicated on September 30, 2006. The $1.4 million memorial, designed by Yardley architect Liuba Laschyk, includes twin fountains representing the towers of the World Trade Center; a Walk of Remembrance, with a series of glass panels etched with the names of the 2,973 people who lost their lives in the 9-11 attacks; and a memorial rail etched with the names of the 17 residents from Bucks County who were killed. Each year the Yardley Inn hosts a fundraiser called &quot;Cooking with the Chef&quot; to raise additional funding for maintenance of the Garden of Reflection.

Washington Crossing Historic Park is located just over the Lower Makefield Township town line in the Washington Crossing section of Upper Makefield Township. From this site, General George Washington and men of the Continental Army and militia crossed the Delaware River on the night of December 25–26, 1776 and marched to Trenton, New Jersey. There they attacked and defeated Hessian troops quartered in and around the village. This surprise attack and victory set the stage for Washington&#x27;s subsequent victories at the Second Battle of Trenton and Princeton. The Crossing and the Trenton/Princeton campaign have become known as the Ten Crucial Days — a campaign that saved Washington&#x27;s army from defeat, allowing them to fight another day and achieve ultimate victory.

<text>Middletown Township is a township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 46,040 at the 2020 census. Many sections of Levittown are located in the southern end of the township. The municipality surrounds the boroughs of Langhorne, Langhorne Manor, Penndel and Hulmeville; much of the township beyond Levittown uses Langhorne as its mailing address. The township is located within the Delaware Valley, also known as the Philadelphia metropolitan area.

Also located within the township is Core Creek Park. The township also has many acres of protected woods, the largest being the woods behind Neshaminy High School. The Neshaminy Creek flows through these woods. There are also some few protected farms, most significantly that of Styer&#x27;s Orchards, which was saved from turning into the site of 632 homes in the late 1990s.

Sesame Place is located in Middletown Township.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 19.4 square miles (50.2 km2), 19.1 square miles (49.5 km2) of which is land and 0.3 square mile (0.7 km2) (1.39%) of which is water.

Place names in Middletown Township include Bucktoe, Chicken Foot, Edgewood, Glenlake, Levittown (also in Bristol and Falls Township, and Tullytown Borough), Maple Point, Oxford Valley, Parkland, Pickpocket, Timbucktoo, and Woodbourne.

Natural features include Core Creek, Lake Luxembourg in Core Creek Park, Edge Hill, Langhorne Water Works Run, Neshaminy Creek, and Newtown Creek.

The Fall Line, which separates the Atlantic Coastal Plain region from the Piedmont region, runs through Middletown Township.

==History==
Middletown Township was formally established in 1692 and originally included within its boundaries the present-day boroughs of Langhorne, Langhorne Manor, Hulmeville, and Penndel.

Middletown Township began as a farming community, with close proximity to trading towns such as Langhorne and Newtown. There are not many significant historical places located in the township apart from homes and farms constructed in the late 18th century.

Middletown Township was sparsely populated before 1950: there were only a little more than 2,000 people in 1930, compared to about 46,000 in 2010. Then William Levitt began his second Levittown, which included land of four municipalities, including that of Middletown. Twelve developments were constructed in the township, with the majority of them containing hundreds of homes. This marked the first planned residential development in the township. Meanwhile, Langhorne Terrace was being constructed out of the Neshaminy Woods. During this decade, the township grow by over 440%, or more than 20,000 new residents. As the decades passed, its woods, countryside, and farms continued to be swallowed into homes and businesses. In the 1970s, the Oxford Valley Mall was constructed, and at the time was named the country&#x27;s largest mall for a short time.

Growth continues to this day; however, Middletown has taken action. The township preserved hundreds of acres now known as Core Creek Park, which includes the sprawling Lake Luxembourg. Many woodlands and a few farms have also been saved. The township has transformed from a bucolic, rural area to a car-centric and haphazardly planned community, with rising crime and an award-winning school district. The township is still seeing a growing population, attracting many out-of-state residents and international migrants. 
Middletown is nearby the cities of Philadelphia, Trenton, and Princeton. Both I-295 and U.S. 1 pass through the township, which are at or over capacity with rush hour traffic.

Edgemont and Harewood and Beechwood are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Demographics==
As of a 2014 estimate, the township was 84.1% Non-Hispanic White, 5.5% Black or African American, 0.2% Native American, 5.0% Asian, 0.2% Some other race, and 1.4% were two or more races. 4.9% of the population were of Hispanic or Latino ancestry.

As of the 2010 census, the township was 88.3% Non-Hispanic White, 3.2% Black or African American, 0.2% Native American, 4.0% Asian, and 1.6% were two or more races. 3.1% of the population were of Hispanic or Latino ancestry.
As of the 2000 census, there were 44,141 people, 15,321 households, and 11,659 families residing in the township. The population density was . There were 15,713 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the township was 93.86% White, 2.10% African American, 0.15% Native American, 2.40% Asian, 0.55% from other races, and 0.93% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.71% of the population. The Asian population is a fast-growing segment of the township.

There were 15,321 households, out of which 38.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 63.3% were married couples living together, 9.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 23.9% were non-families. 19.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.81 and the average family size was 3.25.

In the township the population was spread out, with 26.2% under the age of 18, 7.7% from 18 to 24, 29.7% from 25 to 44, 23.4% from 45 to 64, and 13.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females there were 94.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.4 males.

About 2.1% of families and 3.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 2.8% of those under age 18 and 4.7% of those age 65 or over.

Like much of the Delaware Valley, Middletown&#x27;s immigrant population is skyrocketing. With many new, upscale housing developments, many of the households were bought by foreign-born residents. Middletown&#x27;s immigrant population largely consists of Indians, Koreans, Mexican Americans and Russians. However many others too, such as Chinese, Hispanics, and Arabs, have growing numbers. Aside from European immigration, Middletown&#x27;s immigrant population has mostly arrived after 1990.

==Transportation==

As of 2018 there were of public roads in Middletown Township, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the township.

Interstate 295 is the most prominent highway traversing Middletown Township. It follows a generally south-to-north alignment across eastern portions of the township. U.S. Route 1 also traverses the township as a freeway, following a southwest-to-northeast alignment through the center of the township. U.S. Route 1 Business follows the Lincoln Highway parallel and to the south of the US 1 freeway. Pennsylvania Route 213 follows Maple Avenue along an east-west alignment through the center of the township, terminating at US 1 Business near the east edge of the township. Pennsylvania Route 332 briefly enters the northern edge of the township along the Newtown Bypass. Pennsylvania Route 413 follows a generally southeast-to-northwest alignment through the center of the township, utilizing several roadways. Finally, Pennsylvania Route 513 briefly enters the township as it travels between Penndel and Hulmeville.

SEPTA Regional Rail&#x27;s West Trenton Line runs through Middletown Township, with the Woodbourne station located in the township and the Langhorne station located nearby in Langhorne Manor. SEPTA provides bus service to Middletown Township along City Bus route and Suburban Bus routes , and , serving points of interest in the township and offering connections to Philadelphia and other suburbs.

==Politics==
The township was once dominated by the Republican Party like most of Bucks County, due to a more bucolic, rural feel. However, after years of growth, including migration of peoples from Democratic areas, the area has been trending Democratic. The Neshaminy School Board and Middletown Township Board of Supervisors both lack a one party dominance, which used to be mostly or all Republican. 
In the 2006 mid-term elections, Ed Rendell (Governor), Bob Casey (U.S. Senator) and Chris King (Pennsylvania&#x27;s 142nd Representative District), who are all Democrats, won the township. The heavily battled election between Mike Fitzpatrick and Patrick Murphy for the 8th Congressional district was split 50/50 like much of the area.

==Education==

Middletown Township lies within the Neshaminy School District. Students living within township boundaries may attend either Albert Schweitzer Elementary School, Herbert Hoover Elementary School, Pearl S. Buck Elementary School, Tawanka Elementary School, or Walter Miller Elementary School for grades K-4, depending on where they live. Carl Sandburg Middle School and Maple Point Middle School serve students in grades 5–8, and Neshaminy High School serves students in grades 9-12.

Cairn University, a private religious university, is partially located within township boundaries.

==Commerce and growth==

Oxford Valley Mall is at the center of the township&#x27;s commercial retail area; it is surrounded by over 30 car dealerships and car automotive shops and over 40 restaurant chains, and several major retail stores. A number of furniture stores, hotel chaing, a major hospital, and office buildings are also located in the Oxford Valley Mall vicinity. 

Many homes have been constructed around the mall, the oldest being Langhorne Gardens, a branch of Levittown, Pennsylvania. Many newly constructed townhouses, condos, and large single-family homes have been built. As thousands of people from other continents have settled near the mall, there is a wide variety of ethnic food, churches, and superstores in its vicinity.

Traffic has become a major concern. Nearby U.S. 1 and Interstate 295 allow commuters to congest the mall area roads, along with the surplus of residents in the area. Over 400,000 people reside less than ten minutes from the mall, plus the many commuters from nearby New Jersey. Many major construction projects are planned for the major access roads. There is a significant, and fast-growing foreign presence in the area.

Middletown Township is the home to the corporate headquarters of McCaffrey&#x27;s Food Markets, an upscale regional grocery store chain which has locations in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

==Housing==
Middletown has a large mix of housing construction and time periods, which range from the fifties to new construction. Almost all the development that occurred in the fifties were the Levittown sections. Housing ranges from cheap single-family housing to exorbitant single-family living, and also townhomes, condos, assisted living, apartment complexes, deluxe apartment complexes, and 55+ housing. There are no trailer parks in Middletown. There are a handful of homes constructed before 1950, even a few dating back to the 18th century, however they are individual homes and scattered, due to Levittown being the first planned development. The most significant area with scattered housing periods is the area of Parkland. Houses date from every decade of the 20th century, and the 21st. Parkland has the lowest land value and family incomes than any other area of Middletown.

<doc id="131535" wikidata="Q946911" url="?curid=131535" title="Morrisville, Bucks County, Pennsylvania">
<text>Morrisville (, ) is a borough in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located just below the falls of the Delaware River opposite Trenton, New Jersey. The population was 9,809 in the 2020 Census.

Morrisville is located northeast of Philadelphia and southeast of Allentown.

==History==
The earliest known settlement in what is now Morrisville, was a trading post of the Dutch West India Company operating from 1624 to 1627 on an island in the Delaware River. In its early days, the area was known as Crewcorne and was a part of Falls Township. Later, one of the first ferries to cross the Delaware was established at the site. By the late 18th century, a settlement was forming at the ferry crossing then known as Colvin&#x27;s Ferry. The settlement incorporated into a borough in 1804, taking the name of Morrisville, after Founding Father Robert Morris. In that same year, the first bridge began being built across the Delaware connected Morrisville to Trenton. It would welcome traffic in 1806.

The Gershom Craft House, Summerseat, and Trenton City/Calhoun Street Bridge are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Summerseat is also designated a National Historic Landmark.

Morrisville is also home to Graystones, the historic site marking William Penn&#x27;s first Pennsylvania land purchase from the Lenape Indian tribe.

Morrisville was once considered for the nation&#x27;s capital. Robert Morris campaigned behind the scenes to establish the new capital at the &quot;Falls of the Delaware&quot;, preferably on the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware River, which can be seen from Park Avenue in Morrisville, just atop of the 30-foot tall flood control dike. The Delaware River is viewed from here and just below is the famous Falls of the Delaware, for which Falls Township was named.

==Geography==
Morrisville is located at (40.207458, -74.779918). It is part of a geographical salient that is mostly surrounded by New Jersey.

Originally a village located in Falls Township, until it was partitioned as a borough by the Pennsylvania Legislature in 1804, Morrisville is bordered by Falls Township to the south, Lower Makefield Township to the north and the Delaware River to the east.

Its name is the default city name in the 19067 ZIP code, which covers an area that includes Yardley, Lower Makefield, Morrisville, and part of Falls Township.

<text>New Hope is a borough in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,612 at the 2020 census. New Hope is located approximately north of Philadelphia, and lies on the west bank of the Delaware River at its confluence with Aquetong Creek. New Hope and neighboring Solebury and Upper Makefield townships are part of the Philadelphia metropolitan area. The two-lane New Hope–Lambertville Bridge carries automobile and foot traffic across the Delaware to Lambertville, New Jersey, on the east bank. New Hope&#x27;s primary industry is tourism.

Historic former residents include Founding Father Aaron Burr and author James A. Michener.

==History==
===18th century===


New Hope is located along the route of the Old York Road, the former main highway between Philadelphia and New York City. It was generally regarded as the halfway point, where travelers would stay overnight and be ferried across the Delaware River the next morning. The section of U.S. Route 202 that passes just north of New Hope is still named York Road, and the original route is now Bridge Street (PA 179).

New Hope was first called &quot;Coryell&#x27;s Ferry,&quot; after the owner of the ferry business. The current name came into use following a fire in 1790 that destroyed several mills in the area; their reconstruction was considered a &quot;new hope.&quot;

The night prior to George Washington&#x27;s crossing of the Delaware River, Washington lodged in New Hope, and then destroyed the ferry so the British Army could not follow him. Following the Battle of Trenton and Battle of Princeton, when British troops were sweeping the area, seeking Continental Army troops, there was no response when they rang for the ferry. The British assumed the town was sympathetic to the Continental Army and shelled the town. Several of the older structures in the town still claim to have unexploded British ordnance lodged in their roofbeams.

===19th century===
The North Pennsylvania Railroad finished construction of their New Hope Branch in 1891, later being taken over by the Reading Railroad. Passenger service to Philadelphia&#x27;s Reading Terminal as well as all other passenger activity was terminated in 1952 from Hatboro, also the end for electrified track, and New Hope. 

===20th century===
Between 1952 and 1966, only freight trains were seen entering and leaving New Hope, mostly to deliver paper pulp for the Union Camp Paper Corp. and to deliver sand and gravel to James D. Morrissey Materials Co., a cement company and a division of James D. Morrissey, Inc. In 1966, the New Hope and Ivyland Railroad was formed and bought of track from New Hope southwest to Ivyland. Scenic tourist excursions started the same year. Freight service to New Hope was then handled by the New Hope and Ivyland Railroad. In 1972, SEPTA, who by then took over Reading Railroad&#x27;s passenger operations, extended the electrified route to Warminster, where the current interchange for both SEPTA and NHRR is. Freight service to James D. Morrissey Materials Co. ceased sometime in the late 1970s and to Union Camp Paper Corp. in 1985. The New Hope and Ivyland Railroad continues to provide scenic tourist excursion passenger trains between New Hope and nearby Lahaska.

In 1983, NBC network anchorwoman Jessica Savitch and her boyfriend drowned after their car overturned into the Delaware Canal. The canal passes by Odette&#x27;s Restaurant, where the couple had dined on a rainy evening when visibility was poor and two warning signs were missed.

===21st century===

<text>Newtown is a borough in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,268 at the 2020 census. It is located just west of the Trenton, New Jersey metropolitan area, and is part of the larger Philadelphia metropolitan area. It is entirely surrounded by Newtown Township, from which it separated in 1838. State Street is the main commercial thoroughfare with wide sidewalks, shops, taverns, and restaurants.

== History ==
===17th century===
Newtown was founded by William Penn in 1684. Newtown was one of several towns that William Penn organized around Philadelphia to provide country homes for city residents and to support farming communities. 

===18th century===
It was the county seat of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, from 1726 until 1813, when it was replaced by a more central Doylestown. After his December 26, 1776 morning march to Trenton, and before the Battle of Princeton, Continental Army commander-in-chief George Washington made his headquarters in Newtown. 

===19th century===
Newtown was incorporated on April 16, 1838 and has been enlarged three times since. In 1969 Newtown&#x27;s entire central business district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. This designation was largely due to Newtown&#x27;s historic clock tower. Newtown is enhanced by unique boutiques, colleges, cuisine, a climate for industry, Pennsylvania&#x27;s most popular state park (Tyler State Park) and a Heritage Walk that traces the very steps of George Washington. The Law School Admission Council is headquartered in Newtown Township. As a result, many American lawyers have heard of Newtown. The oldest operating movie theater in America is Newtown Theatre at 120 North State Street.

Newtown is known for its wealth of history. One of the most noted former residents of Newtown was painter Edward Hicks, who lived in Newtown for over forty years with his family, where he was able to own his own business.

Newtown is in the Council Rock School District. While the district serves many towns in Lower Bucks County, Newtown Township is home to Council Rock High School North, Newtown Middle School (formerly Newtown Junior High), Goodnoe Elementary School, Newtown Elementary School, and the former Chancellor Street School, which now acts as the administrative building for the district. The only private school in the township is St. Andrews Catholic Education Center. George School, though associated with Newtown, is mostly in Middletown Township, and Newtown Friends School, though it bears Newtown&#x27;s name, is located entirely in Middletown Township. The township is also the site of Bucks County Community College&#x27;s main campus. La Salle University and Holy Family University also have satellite campuses on the Newtown Bypass.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Highways====

As of 2010 there were of public roads in Newtown, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the borough.

State Street runs through Newtown&#x27;s main commercial area and intersects with Washington Avenue at the borough&#x27;s infrastructural center. Pennsylvania Routes 532, 332, and 413 pass outside the borough in surrounding areas of Newtown Township via the Newtown Bypass.

====Passenger trains====

Until January 14, 1983, Newtown was served by SEPTA&#x27;s Fox Chase/Newtown Line commuter rail service. At that time, service was suspended because of failing train equipment. Since then, there has been constant talk of reinstating service because of recent strong population growth in the surrounding area; however, this has not materialized. There was also a movement under way to convert the unused rail corridor into a bike trail that has thus far been unsuccessful because of resistance in surrounding communities.

SEPTA has no current plans to restore train service. The issue of resuming commuter service has been a political albatross almost from the day the trains stopped. Newtown remains the victim in all the political squabbling that has amassed over the years, as they have always given strong support of returned commuter service and have the most to gain. Author Joseph Schwieterman commented in 2001 that &quot;few communities experiencing the loss of service have engaged in as protracted a dialogue about bringing back their passenger trains as Newtown. The continuing impasse has left many transit advocates skeptical that the borough will ever be accessible by rail again.&quot;

In September 2009, the Southampton-based Pennsylvania Transit Expansion Coalition (PA-TEC) began discussions with all townships along the rail line, as well as SEPTA officials, about possible resumption of passenger service. Bucks County officials and Newtown residents overwhelmingly supported PA-TEC&#x27;s efforts, making it official in December 2009 when the Newtown Board of Supervisors passed a resolution supporting the full restoration of passenger service; neighboring Montgomery County officials are also supportive of re-thinking the rail corridor as well.

Toll Brothers built the &quot;Newtown Station&quot; development east of the station site.

The nearest station to Newtown is Woodbourne station on SEPTA&#x27;s West Trenton Line.

====Bus====
SEPTA currently serves Newtown with SEPTA Suburban Bus Route 130, which runs to nearby Bucks County Community College and south to the Langhorne station along SEPTA Regional Rail&#x27;s West Trenton Line and Frankford Avenue and Knights Road in Northeast Philadelphia.

Numbered routes serving Northampton Township include Pennsylvania Route 213, which runs northeast–southwest along the southeastern border of the township along Bridgetown Pike on its route between Feasterville and Langhorne; Pennsylvania Route 232, which runs north–south through the township along Second Street Pike on its route between Southampton and Wrightstown Township; Pennsylvania Route 332, which runs east–west through the township along Jacksonville Road, Almshouse Road, and Newtown Richboro Road on its route between Ivyland and Newtown; and Pennsylvania Route 532, which passes northeast–southwest through the eastern part of the township along Buck Road on its route between Feasterville and Newtown.

Other roads include Bristol Road, which runs northwest–southeast along the southwestern border of the township; Almshouse Road, which begins in Richboro and heads east–west along PA 332 before splitting from PA 332 and continuing west towards Jamison; Bustleton Pike, which runs north–south through the township from Feasterville to its north end at PA 232 in Richboro; and Holland Road, which runs north–south through the eastern portion of the township between PA 532 and PA 332.

TMA Bucks operates the Richboro-Warminster Rushbus, which offers peak-hour shuttles from Richboro and Northampton Township to a connection with SEPTA Regional Rail&#x27;s Warminster Line and SEPTA City Bus Route 22 at the Warminster station in Warminster Township.

The communities of Holland and Churchville had commuter train service until January 1983 via SEPTA&#x27;s Fox Chase-Newtown Rapid Transit Line. Service was &quot;temporarily&quot; suspended due to failing train equipment resulting in poor ridership. While Churchville Station has been restored, Holland station was demolished in 2000.

In the ensuing years (particularly post-1995), there has been heavy interest in resuming passenger service by Bucks County officials. Several housing booms throughout the 1980s and 1990s have resulted in homes being situated directly adjacent to the dormant rail line. Though there is overwhelming support from a majority of residents looking for better public transportation options, several residents along Old Jordan Road in Holland have voiced NIMBY opposition to the reactivation of regular passenger service.

Though rail service was initially replaced with a Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus, patronage remained light. The replacement bus service was far slower and less convenient than the train service it replaced, resulting in the shuttle bus being very unpopular. The travelling public never saw a bus service as a suitable replacement for a rail service.

<text>Perkasie is a borough in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. Perkasie is southeast of Allentown and north of Philadelphia.

Establishments in the borough early in the 20th century included silk mills, brickyards, lumber mills, tile works, a stone crusher, and manufacturers of cigars, tags and labels, and wire novelties. The population in 1900 was 1,803; in 1910, 2,779 people lived in Perkasie. The population was 9,120 at the 2020 census, up from 8,511 at the 2010 census.

==History==
===Perkasie etymology and town formation===
Both the town of Perkasie and Pocasie Creek derive their name from the Lenape Unami phrase Pèhpahkàsink/&quot;Poekskossing&quot;, which translates to &quot;One who goes to the place to crack nuts&quot;. The Dutch/Swedish (before the British settlements) pronounced the word with an r and it stuck. There was doubtless a village on the site of the present town before William Penn’s Perkasie Manor was settled.&quot; &quot;The &quot;Manor&quot; of Perkasie was one of several in Bucks County and contained . Laid out and surveyed in 1708, it embraced most of Hilltown and Rockhill Township.&quot;

===1890 fire===
On June 8, 1890, a disastrous fire began at the livery stable located at 7th and Chestnut Streets; twelve buildings were destroyed. Personal buckets and ladders were used to extinguish the fire. Less than a month later, on July 4, 1890, a committee appointed by Perkasie Borough Council met to form the Hope Fire Company. On September 8, 1890, the Hope Fire Company met at Groover&#x27;s Hall (517 Chestnut Street) and adopted a constitution and by-laws; 32 members were present. At the same time, borough council turned over to the fire company a hand pumper purchased from Newtown Fire Association, and a hose cart purchased from Philadelphia with of hose. One month later, the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad presented the Fire Company with a tire for a steam locomotive driver wheel for use as a fire alarm. This was installed in a cupola of the Groover building (now in front of Silverdale Fire Company).

===Industry===
Between 1920 and 1950, a factory at 815 Chestnut Street produced millions of hand stitched major-league baseballs through a Hubbert/Spalding contract. The building was subsequently converted into the Senior Citizens Center, which has since moved to the neighboring borough of Silverdale. It is now scheduled to be converted to six two-bedroom condominiums by Habitat for Humanity of Bucks County to provide a new start for families in need. The organization plans to utilize green building techniques while preserving the building&#x27;s historical exterior.

===1988 fire and recovery===
On June 26, 1988, about 15 percent of the town, including many historic buildings, were burned down in what became known as The Great Perkasie Fire. This massive fire was started by two 12-year-old boys who were playing with a lighter near the coal bins behind the Shelley &amp; Sons lumberyard at Seventh and Market Streets. The fire was fought by about 300 firefighters who came from over 50 fire companies in three counties. Among the historic buildings lost were the American House and the Moyer-Kantner Funeral Home, both dating from 1870; the Herstine Building; and the J.G. Moyer building. The latter was photographed for the cover of the July 7, 1945 edition of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, an artistic rendition of a Fourth of July parade by John Falter. Despite the size of the fire, no fatalities were reported. Immediately after the fire, a group of concerned business owners, residents and borough officials formed a Downtown Restoration Task Force. The Task Force was given the name of the Perkasie Olde Towne Association. This group was the forerunner to the Perkasie Towne Improvement Association (PTIA). The PTIA along with Perkasie&#x27;s local government were responsible for the three-phase town improvement plan that was completed over the next five intervening years. The PTIA&#x27;s focus was to oversee the reconstruction of not only the area of the town center affected by the fire, but also other retail and residential areas in the central part of the borough. As a result of these efforts, streetscape enhancements of decorative street lights, underground utilities, new sidewalks with decorative brick borders were built and new benches, trash receptacles and street trees were placed throughout the focus area.

===Historical sites===
The South Perkasie Covered Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The Pearl S. Buck House at Green Hills Farm, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, is located near Perkasie in Hilltown Twp.

===Interurban trolley to Philadelphia===
From 1901 to 1951, Perkasie was an important stop on the hourly running Lehigh Valley Transit Company&#x27;s electric interurban trolley line from Allentown through Quakertown to Perkasie, then south to Sellersville, Souderton, Lansdale, Norristown, and Philadelphia. During World War II, as the result of gasoline rationing with auto use restricted, it transported a very large number of passengers. After the war, the railway&#x27;s business collapsed, and it ceased service in 1951. The LVT former station sits on 4th Street, just south of the LVT tunnel (with a trolley mural on one wall) which passed under the former Reading Railroad&#x27;s line to Bethlehem.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

As of 2015 there were of public roads in Perkasie, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the borough.

PA 152 runs through the southern portion of Perkasie, while PA 563 runs along the northwestern edge of the borough. PA 313 passes to the east, PA 113 passes to the south and PA 309 passes to the west. The nearest Interstate Highways are I-476, I-276 and I-78.

The borough&#x27;s nearest airport is Pennridge Airport, a public general aviation airport with one -long runway. It is just north of the center of town, on the other side of the East Rockhill Township border.

There is currently no public transportation in Perkasie. Perkasie was once served by the Reading Railroad&#x27;s North Penn Division, also known as the Bethlehem Branch, which was once part of the North Pennsylvania Railroad. The line is now owned by SEPTA, which ended passenger service in the early 1980s. The last SEPTA-operated Bethlehem Line Philadelphia-bound passenger train passed through Perkasie on July 29, 1981. Conrail subsequently continued freight operations out of Lansdale up to Quakertown until the mid 90s. The East Penn Railroad, formally known as East Penn Railway (EPRY), leased a portion of the railroad from SEPTA, saving the line from abandonment from Telford through to Quakertown. 
SEPTA recently issued a formal proposal to perform maintenance on the line and restore passenger service, either installing catenary for electric trains, or using diesel trains connecting to the Lansdale/Doylestown Line in Lansdale. The project would take at least five years.

As of late 2009, unmarked freight cars, particularly covered hoppers, are stored along the southbound track in Perkasie between Market Street and Park Avenue, from Park Avenue to the Old Bethlehem Pike Bridge, and so on to Meetinghouse Road in Telford. East Penn through Perkasie with ex-Conrail B23-7 3153 runs about two to three times a week, passing through Perkasie to Telford, and again passing through Perkasie while returning to Quakertown. The trains usually run between 10:00am and 4:00pm during the week.

One feature of the rail line through Perkasie is the Perkasie Tunnel. The southern portal of the tunnel is just southeast of the intersection of Ridge Road, Ridge Avenue and Tunnel Road in Perkasie, while the northern portal is near the southwest end of Pennridge Airport in East Rockhill Township.

===Utilities===
The Perkasie Borough Electric Department provides electricity to the borough. The electric department originated out of a need to improve street lighting, using a generator before a power plant was built in 1900. In 1947, with the growth in demand for electricity, the borough kept the electric distribution system but begin receiving electricity wholesale from Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light (now PPL Corporation). A modern substation serving the borough&#x27;s electric system was constructed in 1995. The Perkasie Borough Electric Department currently purchases its electricity wholesale from multiple sources. The borough&#x27;s Public Works department provides trash collection and recycling, while natural gas service is provided by UGI Utilities.

==History==

Quakertown was originally settled by Quakers. 

===18th century===
On September 18, 1777, during the American Revolutionary War, a convoy of wagons carrying the Liberty Bell from Philadelphia to Allentown, under the command of Col. Thomas Polk of Charlotte, North Carolina, stopped in Quakertown. The Liberty Bell was stored overnight behind the home of Evan Foulke (1237 West Broad Street), and the entourage stayed at the Red Lion Inn. The John Fries&#x27; Rebellion was also started in the Red Lion Inn in 1799.

===19th century===
In 1803, the first post office was opened and the community named Quakertown. 

In the decades before the Civil War, Quakertown was a hub of the Underground Railroad, with stationmaster Richard Moore aiding over 600 freedom seekers.

The Civil War, along with national economic expansion, changed Quakertown from a tiny village to a commercial manufacturing center. In the 19th century, local industrial establishments included cigar and cigar box factories, silk mills, harness factories, and stove foundries.

In 1854, Quakertown elected its first Burgess. North Pennsylvania Railroad facilitated access to the area, which brought about a great increase in population; by 1880, Quakertown&#x27;s population reached nearly 1,800.

With car use limited during World War II due to gasoline rationing, the trolley line moved a very large number of passengers.

Following World War II, however, its business collapsed, and it ceased operation in 1951. The Lehigh Valley Transit station in Quakertown, located at the northwestern corner of Main and Broad streets across from the Red Lion Inn, still stands and its historical significance is marked on the former station&#x27;s wall.

<text>Riegelsville is a borough in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 868 at the 2010 census. It is included in the Philadelphia–Wilmington–Camden metropolitan statistical area, despite being so closely connected to the Lehigh Valley.

==History==

Benjamin Riegel founded Riegelsville. The original, and now historic, Riegelsville Inn that he built in 1838 still stands. This historic stone inn has offered food and lodging to Bucks County travelers for over 160 years. The community was named for the Riegel family, as early landowners. They established paper mills across the Delaware River in Warren County, New Jersey.

With the completion of the Delaware Canal in 1832, the lands along the Delaware River attracted great industrial development. The movement of coal, a major important product of the area, brought capital &amp; investment to Easton. Boats carried coal, stone, iron, crops, and goods from the mills along the 60 miles from Easton to Bristol. Along Canal Street grew one of the largest industrial manufacturing centers of America during the 1830s and 1840s. Easton continued to prosper as a center for industry, manufacturing, commerce, and culture at the Forks of Delaware and along the great rail lines. Between 1904 and 1926, Riegelsville was served by electric passenger and freight trolleys of the Doylestown &amp; Easton Street Railway Company. Riegelsville prospered when the Delaware Canal opened in 1832 with warehouses and factories lining its banks. The canal closed in 1931 after 99 years of service and was replaced by the railroads. Today, Riegelsville is a peaceful and quiet town. Woods and fields border the Delaware Canal; remnants of crumbling stone foundations along its banks are reminders of a busy past.
Riegelsville was a mill town in the late 1880s and 1900s. The borough overlooks the Delaware River, spanned by the Riegelsville Bridge, built in 1904 by John A. Roebling&#x27;s Sons, Co. and connecting with Riegelsville, New Jersey. It is one of the approximately three dozen bridges spanning the Delaware River between Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

Residences near the river built by Riegel Paper Company executives in the late 1880s along &quot;Mansions Row&quot; have been restored.

The Benjamin Riegel House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

<text>Sellersville is a borough in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 4,249 at the 2010 census. It is in the Pennridge School District.

==History==
===18th century===

Sellersville was founded in the early 18th century. It was centered on a major road known as Bethlehem Pike that connected Philadelphia to Bethlehem and the rest of what was then Western Pennsylvania. The town was very small and was called Sellers Tavern. Its most notable feature was a large inn. The present Washington House in Sellersville, however, was not Sellers Tavern. The town grew slowly over the years until the Industrial Revolution.

===19th century===
In the 1860s, the North Pennsylvania Railroad was built, running parallel to Bethlehem Pike: this stimulated the growth of light textile industries and brought a wave of population growth. The East Branch of the Perkiomen Creek runs through the town which connects it to an adjacent town of Perkasie. This creek was dammed in the early 20th century creating a small body of water known as Lake Lenape. Along the length of the lake a park was built on Perkasie and Sellersville lands. In the 1920s and 1930s this park housed a carousel, a roller coaster and several other amusements. The railroad brought hundreds of people from Philadelphia in the summer time, and it became a well known vacation spot for blue collar city workers.

===20th century===
In August 1938, Deutschhorst Country Club, a summer retreat created by the German American Bund, a Pro-Nazi organization moved to the area after purchasing a 40-acre ranch outside of the town. The group used the area as a summer camp where family functions and activities were pursued in addition to political rallies. As World War II approached, the club sought to distance itself several times from the Nazi cause in local newspapers and was reported as &quot;almost abandoned&quot; from a lack of use by 1940. FBI agents were reported to have been watching the club grounds and visitors were reported to have covered their license plates in order to avoid being identified as a Bund member.

In September 1939, shortly after the start of World War II, the leader of German American Bund, Fritz Julius Kuhn, gave a speech to gathered members of the German American Bund and associated groups such as the World War I German Veteran league known as the Kyffhauser Bund, declaring that with the start of the war Adolf Hitler would &quot;lick the world&quot; in the new conflict. The camp would eventually be closed after the dissolution of the German American Bund on December 8, 1941, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

The town was also home to the Radium Company of America, which was the largest uranium milling facility in the world at the time. A business operating under the name of the United States Gauge Company originated in Sellersville in 1904 and allegedly became a prominent manufacturer of gauges for military use, many of which were coated with radium-based paint for night-time luminescence. The company later became instrumental in the production of nuclear weapons, leaving behind a legacy of industrial and radioactive contamination that has been well-hidden by local, county, state, and federal government agencies for decades.

===21st century===
In the 21st century, the town remains relatively small, sandwiched in between a ridge line and the larger town of Perkasie. The center of town still runs along Bethlehem Pike which is now called Old Route 309. The Washington House has recently been restored to become an upscale restaurant. Next door to the restaurant was a livery stable, which was converted into a theater and later into a movie theater in 1894. It has since been restored, and reopened in 2001 as Sellersville Theater 1894, a popular live music venue. The creek is still dammed but only the carousel in Perkasie remains of the amusements.

The textile industry has long moved out of the area and Sellersville has become mainly a residential town for people working in the many urban centers that are only a short commute away. Grand View Hospital, Bucks County’s first hospital, has provided residents of Bucks and Montgomery counties with comprehensive healthcare services since 1913. The town is surrounded on three sides by open country and spread out housing developments. The local firehouse provides various activities throughout the year, including a carnival in the summer. The Holiday House Pool and Recreation Center becomes a hotspot for people to escape the heat during the summer as well. There are various businesses along Main Street, one being the Washington House, which provide some jobs as well, but largely the town remains a residential area. Sellersville Museum is located off Main Street in Sellersville and displays different exhibits every month.

The Teller Cigar Factory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

<text>Solebury Township is a township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. Solebury Township is located in the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area. The population was 8,709 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Migrating English Quakers began to settle down in an area of Buckingham Township. Around 1702, this area was incorporated into a new township called Solebury—carved out of lands deeded to William Penn. Records indicate that sometime in 1703, Solebury Township had 24 landowners and farmers owning 28 tracts of land, each averaging about 414 acres. Solebury Township once included the area of present-day New Hope until the incorporation of The Borough of New Hope in 1837.

Settlers began to move to Solebury Township after hearing about the township&#x27;s fertile soils and location on the Delaware River. At first, moderately-sized log homes were constructed, followed by more traditional fieldstone houses. These fieldhouses can still be found in the township today.

Solebury Township&#x27;s resources were put to use, and industries began to spring up. While farming continued as a significant industry, mills meant to cut wood, ground grain, pulverize paper, produce silk, and ground limestone were constructed along streams through the township. When villages started to form in the township, they contained a church, store, post office, and blacksmith shop, making the villages self-sustaining. From 1857 to 1873 when it was relocated to Warminster, Emlen Institute, a boarding school for orphaned African American and Native American children established by a bequest from Samuel Emlen Jr. was in Solebury. Samuel Beecher Hart, captain of the &quot;Gray Invincibles&quot; and a state legislator who proposed successful legislation for a monument to Pennsylvania&#x27;s African American soldiers was an alumnus.

In the 1900s, New Hope and the surrounding area in Solebury Township hosted landscapes used in the Pennsylvania Impressionism movement. Impressionists William Lathrop, Edward Redfield, Daniel Garber, Fern Coppedge, Morgan Colt, and Mary Elizabeth Price all resided in Solebury Township, as well as illustrator Charles Hargens, a resident of Carversville, a village in Solebury Township. Today, Solebury Township remains an enclave to artists.

In 1970, the Vietnam Veterans Against the War marched through the town as part of Operation RAW, leaving flyers that said &quot;if you were Vietnamese, we would have&quot; committed specific war crimes against you.

== Landmarks ==
American woodworker George Nakashima&#x27;s home and studio are in Solebury Township. The studio is still in operation today through his daughter Mira. The George Nakashima Woodworker Complex is a National Historic Landmark.

Solebury Township contains four National Historic Landmarks, six National Historic Districts, and more than 400 homes built in the 18th or 19th century. More than 30% of its land is preserved. Solebury Township continues to have an active farming community.

The Atkinson Road Bridge, Center Bridge Historic District, Cuttalossa Valley Historic District, George Nakashima House, Studio and Workshop, Honey Hollow Watershed, Isaiah Paxson Farm, Phillips Mill Historic District, Upper Aquetong Valley Historic District, and Van Sant Covered Bridge are places in Solebury Township that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

The Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 276) passes east–west through Upper Southampton Township, but the nearest interchanges are to the west in Willow Grove and to the east in Bensalem. Pennsylvania Route 132 runs northwest–southeast through the township along Street Road and Pennsylvania Route 232 runs north–south through the township along Second Street Pike. Other important roads include County Line Road, which runs northwest–southeast along the southwestern border with Montgomery County; Bristol Road, which runs northwest–southeast along the northeastern border of the township; Davisville Road, which runs southwest–northeast along the northwestern border of the township; and Bustleton Pike, which runs north–south through the eastern corner of the township. SEPTA provides bus service to Upper Southampton Township along SEPTA City Bus Route 24, which begins in Southampton and heads south to Bethayres, Rockledge, and the Frankford Transportation Center in Northeast Philadelphia.

Upper Southampton Township had two commuter rail stations along SEPTA&#x27;s Fox Chase/Newtown Line until February 1983, the Southampton station along Second Street Pike and the County Line station along County Line Road. Service was &quot;temporarily&quot; suspended due to a lack of ridership along the line. The train station has since been restored and is now a private residence. In the ensuing years (particularly post-1995), there has been interest in resuming passenger service by Bucks County officials; however, neighboring Montgomery County officials are staunchly opposed to it. Though rail service was initially replaced with a Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus, patronage remained light. The replacement bus service was far slower and less convenient than the train service it replaced, resulting in the shuttle bus being very unpopular. The traveling public never saw a bus service as a suitable replacement for a rail service.

==Community association==

Almost every residence in the census designation of Village Shires is part of the Village Shires Community Association. Village Shires is governed by a 7-member community board of directors. The board of directors sets and approves the budget, hires the on-site management, hires the in-house landscaping crew, purchases equipment, contracts with vendors to maintain recreational facilities and community maintenance, and sets community rules and regulations. The on-site management offices are located at 3001 East Village Road.

Village Shires is managed by the Village Shires Community Association (VSCA). The VSCA includes single homes - Heather Valley I and II; townhouses - Country Place I and II, Bridleridge, Natura, and Millpond; and six independent condominium associations, Beacon Hill, Signal Hill/Heritage Place, Tamerlane, Canterbury Croft, Hamlet, and Old Jordan Woods.

In an attempt to facilitate economies of operation, the six condominium associations annually contract with the VSCA to perform combined community services. The VSCA oversees landscaping, snow removal, maintenance, and operation of recreational and common areas through supervisory and contractual agreements with the Danella Management and Realty Co. Inc., an on-site management company.

Community-wide elections are held every November to fill vacant positions on the VSCA Executive Board for the ensuing calendar year. In an effort to ensure continuity of operations, board positions overlap and span two year terms. There are also several committees that report to the executive board, such as the Architectural Control Committee, which assists the executive board in approving or denying requests to make additions and alterations to townhomes by owners.

The Board of Directors meets monthly with the on-site manager to discuss and supervise finances, community matters, correspondence, contractual agreements, vendor and contractor performance, budgetary matters and any other issues pertinent to the community.

<text>Warminster Township, also referred to as Warminster, is located in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. It was formally established in 1711. The township is 13.7 miles north of Philadelphia and had a population of 33,603 according to the 2020 U.S. census.

==History==
The town was called Warminster Township as early as 1685, before its borders were formally established in 1711. It was originally part of Southampton Township, which was founded in 1682 by William Penn. Warminster was named after a small town in the county of Wiltshire, at the western extremity of Salisbury Plain, England. Warminster, Pennsylvania was mostly settled by English and Scotch-Irish colonists after William Penn received a grant of land in the area from King Charles, II. It was the site of the Battle of Crooked Billet during the Revolutionary War, which resulted in a resounding defeat for George Washington&#x27;s colonial troops.

Warminster&#x27;s Craven Hall is included in the National Register of Historic Places listings in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Warminster&#x27;s most significant historical figure was William Tennent, an outspoken religious leader and educator.

Warminster began as a small farming community, and agriculture was central to most of its history. The first steamboat model was designed and made in Warminster township. John Fitch and Steven Pagano were the inventors and designers of the model steam boat that was tried out on the Delaware river and successfully floated.

During World War II, the U.S. Navy acquired an industrial site here from the Brewster Aeronautical Corporation in 1943. The Center initially served as a weapons development and airplane testing facility. The Naval Air Warfare Center, previously called the Johnsville Naval Air Development Center and then the Naval Air Development Center, operated in Warminster from World War II until it closed in 1996. As recently as 1955, the township had no residential subdivisions and only one housing complex, Lacey Park off County Line Road.

In the 1960s the naval site became adapted as a training center for the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo space programs. The facility also developed a prototype &quot;black box,&quot; best known as the indestructible recorder of cockpit conversations and information in the event of a crash.

<text>Warminster Heights is a census-designated place and part of Warminster Township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located near the eastern border of Hatboro in Montgomery County. The population was 4,124 at the 2010 census.

==History==
This neighborhood, built in 1943, formerly served as the civilian housing area for the long-defunct Brewster Aeronautical Corporation, established in 1941, while the area was still referred to as Johnsville. The military facility was later known as Johnsville Naval Air Base, separated from the residential area and later became the Naval Air Development Center and was finally known as the NAWC, Aircraft Division, Warminster prior to its being decommissioned and closed by the US federal government in the mid-1990s. The community was previously named Lacey Park, for Pennsylvania Militia General John Lacey, who fought during the American Revolutionary War at the Battle of Crooked Billet, which took place near the neighborhood. It is still referred to colloquially as Lacey Park by local residents.

In the 1960s, Lacey Park was renamed Warminster Heights, although to this day many older area residents prefer the former name when referring to the neighborhood. Deserved or not, it had a somewhat odious reputation among the local population as it was a lower class, blue collar, low-rent public housing district during the 1960s and &#x27;70s up to the mid-1980s. The housing project had over 10,000 health and safety violations and was known as the &quot;worst suburban slum in Pennsylvania.&quot; It suffered from a high crime rate and a high rate of house fires. Built in the 1940s by the US federal government, most of the housing units consisted of cinder block on slab construction, in units of four dwellings per structure (similar to Philadelphia row homes), in either one or two stories, generally with central heating via coal or heating oil furnaces with mostly electric appliances. Between 1957 and 1975 the housing units were under private ownership; in 1975 the Redevelopment Authority of Bucks County took over and managed the properties, and in 1986 ownership was turned over to a housing cooperative called the Warminster Heights Home Owners&#x27; Association. The housing cooperative began renovating the units following the assumption of ownership.
The neighborhood has worked hard to repair its image. It has been known over the years for instances of murder and other violent crimes. The Park, as it is often referred to, has a history and longstanding association with poverty, alcohol abuse, and constant drug activity. (See references)

<text>Warwick Township is a township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 14,437 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
Warwick was formed by petition February 13, 1733 by eighteen residents. It was named after a town in central England and was the home to many Scots-Irish Presbyterians. In 1819, the Township lost over half its territory to the north when Doylestown Township was established.

History is closely tied to several existing structures. The Neshaminy Presbyterian Church is one of the earliest religious associations in Pennsylvania, dating back to 1726. The Moland House was General George Washington&#x27;s headquarters when 11,000 Continental Army troops camped in Warwick Township from August 10 to August 23, 1777, while on their way to the Battle of Brandywine. The encampment stretched along both sides of Old York Road, on the slope of Carr&#x27;s Hill to the north, on both sides of Bristol Road, from Mearns Road to Meetinghouse Road. General Washington held a &quot;Council of War&quot; with his four major generals and six brigadier generals in the Moland House. There are nearby historical homes such as the Reading Furnace, which was owned by prominent ironmaster Samuel Van Leer.

While in Warwick Township, the American flag that was designed by Betsy Ross was presented to General Washington, and Warwick Township was the site where the American flag was first flown.

It was here the Marquis de La Fayette and Count Casimir Pulaski joined the American Revolution and distinguished themselves at the Battle of Brandywine and for many years thereafter in the fight for American freedom from England.

The Bridge Valley Bridge and Moland House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Wrightstown Township is a township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,995 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Wrightstown&#x27;s first settler was John Chapman, who emigrated from England in October 1684, with his wife and children and settled on land which was part of the original William Penn Grant. According to legend, they first lived in a &quot;cave&quot; or &quot;sod hut&quot;, probably on what is now Penns Park Road. Twin boys were born in their dwelling during the first winter, originating a long line of descendants, among whom was Henry Chapman Mercer. Although the first dwelling no longer exists, there are seven houses in the Township which were the homes of second and third generation Chapmans. William Smith, who arrived the year after the Chapmans, built a log house which still stands on Mud Road. In addition to the Smith house, there are 140 other houses in the Township which are at least 100 years old.

The boundaries of the Township were established by 1692. A square mile in the center, in the present Penns Park, was reserved for parkland. However, in 1719, this was divided among the surrounding property owners.

In addition to its basically rural character, much of the Wrightstown Township&#x27;s charm is due to its five villages: Penns Park, Pineville, Rushland, Wrightstown and Wycombe. Each village at one time contained its own post office, a rather distinctive facet of life in the Township. Today, all but the Wrightstown Post Office remain, with home delivery available to approximately 50% of the Township through the Newtown Post Office. A small portion of the township is served with home mail delivery through the Furlong Post Office in neighboring Buckingham Township. Other past villages include Anchor and Chain Bridge.

==History==

Yardley was founded by William Yardley, who emigrated to America in July 1682 with his family. He made an agreement with William Penn, before leaving England, to buy for ten pounds. A survey was completed in October 1682, and the area William Yardley settled was called &quot;Prospect Farm.&quot; It was located just outside the present Yardley Borough. William Yardley died in 1693, and his family in 1702–1703, possibly of smallpox. The family&#x27;s burial plots are located in Slate Hill Cemetery, one of the oldest Quaker burial grounds in the state.

A nephew, Thomas Yardley, came to America in 1704 to settle the estate and never returned to England. He opened a ferry line which started operating in 1710 from Letchworth Avenue, the lower boundary of the village, and landed in New Jersey further downstream. This was an important link between West Jersey and the three roads leading to Philadelphia by way of Falls, Langhorne and Newtown. The Yardley family occupied the land for more than 150 years.
When Yardley was founded there were already small settlements at nearby Burlington, Bristol, and Falls Ferry.

Yardley began to develop into a village about 1807, and by 1880 had a population of 820. Early industries included a spoke and handle factory, sawmill, felloe factory, plate and plaster mill, and two flour mills. The first post office, established in 1828, used the name &quot;Yardleyville.&quot; The name became &quot;Yardley&quot; again at the time the Reading Railroad came through the area in 1876.

During the American Civil War, Yardley was a station for the Underground Railroad, an escape route for slaves. Known hiding places were under the eaves of the Continental Hotel (now the Continental Tavern), in bins of warehouses on the Delaware Canal (completed in 1862), and at the General Store (now Worthington Insurance). At Lakeside, the yellow house facing Lake Afton on N. Main Street, one brick-walled cellar room is also thought to have been a hiding place.

The borough of Yardley was incorporated on March 4, 1895.

The Train Collectors Association was founded in Yardley in 1954.

The former Bridge in Yardley Borough, Washington Crossing State Park, and Yardley Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Transportation==

As of 2014 there were of public roads in Yardley, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the borough.

Pennsylvania Route 32 runs through Yardley adjacent to the Delaware River, heading south to Morrisville and north to New Hope and beyond and is a scenic byway. Pennsylvania Route 332 heads west from PA 32 in Yardley and leads to Newtown.

The Philadelphia to Bound Brook, New Jersey, two-track main line of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad passed through and stopped at Yardley; it crossed the Delaware River on a still standing massive stone viaduct called the West Trenton Railroad Bridge. This line now is SEPTA Regional Rail&#x27;s West Trenton Line and operates also as a CSX freight line called the Trenton Subdivision.

SEPTA trains along the West Trenton Line stop at the Yardley station. Prior to the 1950s, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s New York City-bound trains from Washington, D.C., (Royal Blue, Capitol Limited, National Limited, Ambassador, and others) used the Reading&#x27;s trackage to Bound Brook as did the Reading&#x27;s Crusader.

==Historic timeline==

* 1876: The North Pennsylvania Railroad first constructed the railroad through Yardley in 1876 and was leased by the Reading Railroad for 100 years, starting in 1879, to become part of the Reading&#x27;s eventual line to Bound Brook, New Jersey.
* 1843: The United States Postal Service changed the name of the town to Yardley from Yardleyville. This was to avoid confusion with the New York City/Philadelphia train line that made a stop here and at Yardville, New Jersey.

* 2005: On April 4, the Delaware River crested higher than after Hurricane Ivan. The cause was rain and snow melt.

<text>Bruin is a borough in Butler County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 423 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Bruin is located in northeastern Butler County in the valley of Bear Creek, a tributary of the Allegheny River. It is approximately north of Pittsburgh. The borough is surrounded by Parker Township but is separate from it. Pennsylvania Route 268 passes through the center of town, leading northeast to the city of Parker and south to Petrolia.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough of Bruin has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Among the early immigrants who settled in the area soon after the close of the Revolutionary War, were a number of north of Ireland families. In 1796, when the settlement of this section of Butler County began, several of these families migrated here, becoming the pioneers of the township. Among those said to have arrived in that year, embracing these north of Ireland families, were a few Germans and a number of native-born Pennsylvanians.

The land was first laid out and surveyed by John Martin in 1837 and was known as Martinsburg, then part of Parker Township. The name was later changed to Bruin. In 1841 Robert Black opened a store near Fletcher&#x27;s Mill and soon afterward Archibald Martin opened a hotel.

In 1872 came the tidal wave of oil operators, drillers, pumpers and torpedo men, the population rapidly increasing to 500 or more. The Connolly Brothers established a machine shop, and the Twohils opened another. W. J. Harshaw came after the oil discoveries and opened a general store. Woods &amp; Markwell came in early. T. G. Campbell carried on business here for a number of years, and H. M. Caldwell and J. A. McKallip established a general store in 1877. In the fall of that year the decrease in oil production and the smallpox epidemic, which carried away five persons, almost depopulated the village and district. A small band of Indians continued to reside here for a number of years, and at intervals the fathers of the little tribe would revisit the settlements. The young Native men, many of whom were doubtless born in the area, frequently returned to hunt deer or panther. The borough was incorporated in 1901.

==Secret societies in the 19th century==
A lodge of the A.O. U. W. (Ancient Order of United Workmen) was organized in Martinsburg/Bruin in 1873. It was transferred to Petrolia in 1875. The Odd Fellows Lodge, Number 817, was instituted on January 8, 1873, the anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans. Their charter was soon after suspended. United Lodge, Number 127, A.O. U. W., was organized January 25, 1878, with thirty members, J. W. Waters being the first master workman. A hall was erected soon after by the lodge, where W.C. Black&#x27;s store stood. Bruin Lodge, K. of H. (The Knights of Honor), was instituted March 22, 1878, with seventeen members. A small lodge room was subsequently erected. Thanksgiving Lodge, number 1193, I.O.G.T. (International Organisation of Good Templars), was organized March 15, 1878, and Campbell council of the R.T. of T. September 8, 1880. A local union of the E.A.U. was organized and retained its charter for some time, though meetings were seldom held. The Jr. O.U.A.M. (Junior Order United American Mechanics) was a later organization, and claimed a large membership.
