<doc id="132803" wikidata="Q7680114" url="?curid=132803" title="Talley Abbey">
<text>Talley Abbey () is a ruined former monastery of the Premonstratensians (&quot;White Canons&quot;) in the village of Talley in Carmarthenshire, Wales, six miles (10 km) north of the market town of Llandeilo. It lies in the River Cothi valley. Access to the site of the abbey is free, and the site is maintained by Cadw.

==History==

The Order was founded in 1120. In 1126, when it received papal approbation by Pope Honorius II, there were nine houses; others were established in quick succession throughout western Europe, so that at the middle of the fourteenth century there were some 1,300 monasteries for men and 400 for women. They came to England about 1143, first at Newhouse in Lincoln, and before the dissolution under Henry VIII there were 35 houses. Soon after their arrival in England, they founded Dryburgh Abbey in the Borders area of Scotland, which was followed by other communities at Whithorn Priory, Dercongal Abbey and Tongland Abbey all in the Borders area, as well as Fearn Abbey in Ross.

==Description==
The monastery, which was founded by Rhys ap Gruffydd in or about 1185, is in the care of Cadw. In common with Strata Florida Abbey, it was once claimed to be the site of the grave of the medieval Welsh poet Dafydd ap Gwilym, but this is one of the discredited theories of Iolo Morganwg. There are two lakes near the abbey ruins, which was used for fish farming to support the community of monks. The abbey was dissolved by Henry VIII and the structure mined by the villagers for stone to build much of the present village and the chapel next to the abbey. The ruinous tower is surrounded by steep wooded hills, and it can be reached by a circuitous lane from the main road. It is well signposted.

As with many village communities, it was well populated in the Victorian period, as described by Lewis:

&quot;TALLEY, otherwise TÀL-Y-LLYCHAU, a parish, in the union of LLANDILO-VAWR, lower division of the hundred of CAYO, county of CARMARTHEN, SOUTH WALES, 7 miles (N.) from Llandilo-Vawr: containing 1068 inhabitants, of whom 418 are in the Lower, and 650 in the Upper, division. This place, of which the name, signifying &quot;the head of the lakes,&quot; is derived from two large pools, near the church, of about fifty acres in extent, was originally of much greater importance than at present, and the seat of one of the most extensive and venerable ecclesiastical establishments in this part of the principality. The parish . . . comprises by admeasurement 7167 a. 2 r. 19 p., of which the arable proportion may consist of about two-thirds in relation to the pasture, and nearly 200 acres are woodland, and 290 a. 8 p. a common. The surface displays a continued succession of hill and dale, sideland and mountain top, and is rather woody . . . The seat, Edwinsford, stands in the north-west on the confines of the parish, of about half of which the owner of the house is the landed proprietor . . . The church, dedicated to St. Michael, having fallen into decay, was rebuilt in the Grecian style, in 1773 . . . principally from the ruins of the ancient abbey . . . There are places of worship for Baptists and Calvinistic Methodists . . . In the parish are two day schools . . . There are also three Sunday schools . . .&quot; [From A Topographical Dictionary of Wales (S. Lewis, 1844).]

<doc id="132808" wikidata="Q3177915" url="?curid=132808" title="Safety play">
<text>Safety play in contract bridge is a generic name for plays in which declarer maximizes the chances for fulfilling the contract (or achieving a certain score) by ignoring a chance for a higher score. Declarer uses safety plays to cope with potentially unfavorable layouts of the opponent&#x27;s cards. In so doing, declarer attempts to ensure the contract even in worst-case scenarios, by giving up the possibility of overtricks.

Safety plays adapt declarer&#x27;s strategy to the scoring system. In IMP-scoring tournaments and rubber bridge, the primary scoring reward comes from fulfilling the contract and overtricks are of little marginal value. Therefore, safety plays are an important part of declarer technique at quantitative scoring.

In matchpoint games, which use comparative scoring, overtricks are very important. Therefore, although safety plays have a certain role at matchpoints, they are normally avoided if the odds for making the contract are good and overtricks are likely.

==Definition==
The term &quot;safety play&quot; is difficult to define crisply. The Bridge World glossary defines safety play as &quot;the surest line to make the contract, disregarding extra tricks that might be made in some other way.&quot; Marshall Miles has defined it as &quot;playing in such a way as to lose a trick with average breaks in order to avoid losing additional tricks with bad breaks.&quot;

Conflating discussions from various sources yields the following points, each descriptive of safety play characteristics:

*A safety play is made in a single suit. In the context of that suit, it can often be described using other terms that might or might not pertain to the full deal, such as avoidance play, percentage play, coup or duck.
*A safety play, although made in a single suit, is intended to maximize declarer&#x27;s chances to make the contract.
*A safety play usually gives up the opportunity to win as many tricks as possible in a particular suit in order to gain an advantage on the full deal. It therefore is sometimes compared to an &quot;insurance premium&quot;.

==Examples==
Safety plays have a role at both comparative scoring and quantitative scoring, although they are used more often at quantitative scoring because they tend to give up on overtricks.

===Safety play at IMPs===

 The example deal at left is from a team of four game.

South plays 6NT against the lead of the 10. Dummy&#x27;s K wins, and the A and K are played. East discards a small spade on the second club trick.

This particular hand is one of a relatively small group of (non-trivial) deals in which perfect safety is available after the third trick. Single-dummy, using a safety play in diamonds, it is possible to guarantee the contract against any remaining distribution and play of the E-W cards.

South started by expecting to win five clubs, one or two diamonds, four hearts and two spades, but the 4-1 split in clubs complicates matters. Still, a safety play in diamonds will bring in twelve tricks.

It&#x27;s just coincidence, but the proper diamond play on this hand is the same as the percentage play with this diamond holding, considering the suit in isolation. The best play for three diamond tricks is to play the A, and then lead toward either the Q or the J. This play brings in three diamond tricks 73% of the time.

Using that play on this deal brings in twelve tricks 100% of the time. Cash the A, and lead small toward the Q. Then:

*If diamonds are 3-2, South will always win three clubs, three diamonds, four hearts and two spades.
*If diamonds are 4-1 and West has the singleton, East cannot play the K on the second lead without setting up both the Q and the J. If East plays low and West shows out, concede a club and take four clubs, two diamonds, four hearts and two spades. The same play works if East began with five diamonds.
*If diamonds are 4-1 and East has the singleton, West can capture the Q with the K. But in that case West is known to hold four cards in each minor, and on the run of the major suits will be squeezed out of his guard in either diamonds or clubs. In with the K, West can attack dummy&#x27;s entry in diamonds or in clubs, but not both. The same play works if West began with five diamonds.

Note that South gives up the 14% chance of four diamond tricks (finessing the J and then cashing the A, hoping for the K onside and doubleton) in exchange for insuring the contract against any diamond break. If South begins the diamonds by finessing the J, the contract fails against king-fourth in the East hand.

===Safety play at matchpoints===
Safety play usually involves giving up the chance of the maximum result in exchange for the best chance of making the contract. So one seldom sees safety plays made at matchpoints or board-a-match. But even at those forms of scoring, there can be good reasons to make safety plays.

Suppose that, at pairs, declarer is in a standard contract, one that the majority of the field will surely reach. However, the defense makes an unorthodox opening lead, presenting declarer with a possible overtrick. There may now be a way, unavailable to other declarers, that will guarantee the contract while retaining good chances for the overtrick.

Or declarer might be in an unusually good contract. Hugh Kelsey gives this example:

 The bidding goes 1 — 2; Pass, and West leads the K and continues with the 10.

South is in an unusually good matchpoint contract. Most players will open the South hand with 1NT rather than 1. And it is very difficult to reach a heart contract if South opens 1NT or 1: either way, North signs off in diamonds.

In any case, 2 is both an exceptionally good matchpoint contract and difficult to reach. Assuming reasonably competent defense, plus 130 is the limit playing in diamonds, and plus 120 in notrump contracts.

But there&#x27;s an easy way to score plus 140 in 2: take a safety play in hearts by ducking the first round. This gives up the chance of plus 170 (if hearts break 3-3) in exchange for the best chance of plus 140 (if hearts break either 4-2 or 3-3). Note that playing hearts from the top leads to defeat if hearts are 4-2, the most likely split.

===Safety play at notrump===
Safety plays, of course, are not limited to trump contracts. Here is an example of a safety play at notrump.
 South declares 3NT and gets the lead of the Q. After winning the A, declarer leads the 2 and East plays a small spade. The play of the 9 now assures the contract.

If West wins the trick he cannot play another heart without giving the ninth trick to declarer and the tempo to develop more in spades. West therefore switches to a diamond and South wins in hand. South overtakes the K with the A – the key play on this hand – and the A assures an entry to two more spade tricks. If spades are played from top the hand might not make if East holds Q J x x and both minor suits fail to break.

<doc id="132809" wikidata="Q184933" url="?curid=132809" title="Leoš Janáček">
<text>Leoš Janáček (, 3 July 1854 – 12 August 1928) was a Czech composer, music theorist, folklorist, publicist, and teacher. He was inspired by Moravian and other Slavic music, including Eastern European folk music, to create an original, modern musical style.

Born in Hukvaldy, Janáček demonstrated musical talent at an early age and was educated in Brno, Prague, Leipzig, and Vienna. He then returned to live in Brno, where he married his pupil Zdenka Schulzová and devoted himself mainly to folkloristic research. His earlier musical output was influenced by contemporaries such as Antonín Dvořák, but around the turn of the century he began to incorporate his earlier studies of national folk music, as well as his transcriptions of &quot;speech melodies&quot; of spoken language, to create a modern, highly original synthesis. The death of his daughter Olga in 1903 had a profound effect on his musical output; these notable transformations were first evident in the opera &quot;Jenůfa&quot; (often called the &quot;Moravian national opera&quot;), which premiered in 1904 in Brno.

In the following years, Janáček became frustrated with a lack of recognition from Prague, but this was finally relieved by the success of a revised edition of &quot;Jenůfa&quot; at the National Theatre in 1916, which gave Janáček access to the world&#x27;s great opera stages. Janáček&#x27;s later works are his most celebrated. They include operas such as &quot;Káťa Kabanová&quot; and &quot;The Cunning Little Vixen&quot;, the Sinfonietta, the &quot;Glagolitic Mass&quot;, the rhapsody &quot;Taras Bulba&quot;, two string quartets, and other chamber works. Many of Janáček&#x27;s later works were influenced by Czech and Russian literature, his pan-Slavist sentiments, and his infatuation with Kamila Stösslová.

After his death in 1928, Janáček&#x27;s work was heavily promoted on the world opera stage by the Australian conductor Charles Mackerras, who also restored some of his compositions to their original, unrevised forms. In his homeland he inspired a new generation of Czech composers including several of his students. Today he is considered one of the most important Czech composers, along with Dvořák and Bedřich Smetana.

== Biography ==
=== 1854–1872: Early life and family ===
Leoš Janáček, son of schoolmaster Jiří Janacek and Amalie (née Grulichová) Janáčková, was born in Hukvaldy, Moravia (then part of the Austrian Empire) on 3 July 1854. He was born with six surviving siblings, and baptised as Leo Eugen. He was a gifted child in a family of limited means, and showed an early musical talent in choral singing. His father wanted him to follow the family tradition and become a teacher, but he deferred to Janáček&#x27;s obvious musical abilities.

In 1865, young Janáček enrolled as a ward of the foundation of the St Thomas&#x27;s Abbey, Brno, where he took part in choral singing under Pavel Křížkovský and occasionally played the organ. One of his classmates, František Neumann, later described Janáček as an &quot;excellent pianist, who played Beethoven symphonies perfectly in a piano duet with a classmate, under Křížkovský&#x27;s supervision&quot;. Křížkovský found him a problematic and wayward student but recommended his entry to the Prague Organ School. Janáček later remembered Křížkovský as a great conductor and teacher.

=== 1873–1880: Education and early career ===
Janáček originally intended to study piano and organ but eventually devoted himself to composition. He wrote his first vocal compositions while choirmaster of the &quot;Svatopluk Artisan&#x27;s Association&quot; (1873–1876). In 1874, he enrolled at the Prague organ school, under František Skuherský and František Blažek. His student days in Prague were impoverished; with no piano in his room, he had to make do with a keyboard drawn on his tabletop. His criticism of Skuherský&#x27;s performance of the Gregorian mass was published in the March 1875 edition of the journal &quot;Cecilie&quot; and led to his expulsion from the school, but Skuherský relented, and on 24 July 1875 Janáček graduated with the best results in his class.

On his return to Brno he earned a living as a music teacher, and conducted various amateur choirs. From 1876 he taught music at Brno&#x27;s Teachers&#x27; Institute. Among his pupils there was Zdenka Schulzová, daughter of Emilian Schulz, the Institute director. She was later to be Janáček&#x27;s wife. In 1876, he also became a piano student of Amálie Wickenhauserová-Nerudová, with whom he co-organized chamber concertos and performed in concerts over the following two years. In February 1876, he was voted Choirmaster of the &quot;Beseda brněnská&quot; Philharmonic Society. Apart from an interruption from 1879 to 1881, he remained its choirmaster and conductor until 1888.

From October 1879 to February 1880, he studied piano, organ, and composition at the Leipzig Conservatory. While there, he composed &quot;Thema con variazioni&quot; for piano in B-flat, subtitled &quot;Zdenka&#x27;s Variations&quot;. Dissatisfied with his teachers (among them Oscar Paul and Leo Grill), and denied a studentship with Camille Saint-Saëns in Paris, Janáček moved on to the Vienna Conservatory, where from April to June 1880, he studied composition with Franz Krenn. He concealed his opposition to Krenn&#x27;s neo-romanticism, but he quit Josef Dachs&#x27;s classes and further piano study after he was criticised for his piano style and technique. He submitted a violin sonata (now lost) to a Vienna Conservatory competition, but the judges rejected it as being &quot;too academic&quot;. Janáček left the conservatory in June 1880, disappointed despite Franz Krenn&#x27;s very complimentary personal report. One of his classmates and friend in Vienna was composer and pianist Josef Weiss.

=== 1881–1899: Folkloristic work and early compositions ===

Janáček returned to Brno where, on 13 July 1881, he married his young pupil, Zdenka Schulzová.

In 1881, Janáček founded and was appointed director of the organ school, and held this post until 1919, when the school became the Brno Conservatory. In the mid-1880s, Janáček began composing more systematically. Among other works, he created the &quot;Four male-voice choruses&quot; (1886), dedicated to Antonín Dvořák, and his first opera, &quot;Šárka&quot; (1887–1888). During this period he began to collect and study folk music, songs and dances. In the early months of 1887, he sharply criticized the comic opera &quot;The Bridegrooms&quot;, by Czech composer Karel Kovařovic, in a &quot;Hudební listy&quot; journal review: &quot;Which melody stuck in your mind? Which motif? Is this dramatic opera? No, I would write on the poster: &#x27;Comedy performed together with music&#x27;, since the music and the libretto aren&#x27;t connected to each other&quot;. Janáček&#x27;s review apparently led to mutual dislike and later professional difficulties when Kovařovic, as director of the National Theatre in Prague, refused to stage Janáček&#x27;s opera &quot;Jenůfa&quot;.

From the early 1890s, Janáček led the mainstream of folklorist activity in Moravia and Silesia, using a repertoire of folk songs and dances in orchestral and piano arrangements. Many of the tunes he used had been recorded by him but a second source was Xavera Běhálková who sent him 70 to 100 tunes that she had gathered from around the Haná region of central Moravia.

Most of his achievements in this field were published in 1899–1901 though his interest in folklore would be lifelong. His compositional work was still influenced by the declamatory, dramatic style of Smetana and Dvořák. He expressed very negative opinions on German neo-classicism and especially on Wagner in the &quot;Hudební listy&quot; journal, which he founded in 1884. The death of his second child, Vladimír, in 1890 was followed by an attempted opera, &quot;Beginning of the Romance&quot; (1891) and the cantata &quot;Amarus&quot; (1897).

=== 1900–1915: Difficult years ===
In the first decade of the 20th century, Janáček composed choral church music including &quot;Otčenáš&quot; (Our Father, 1901), &quot;Constitues&quot; (1903) and &quot;Ave Maria&quot; (1904). In 1901, the first part of his piano cycle &quot;On an Overgrown Path&quot; was published and gradually became one of his most frequently-performed works. In 1902, Janáček visited Russia twice. On the first occasion he took his daughter Olga to Saint Petersburg, where she stayed to study Russian. Only three months later, he returned to Saint Petersburg with his wife because Olga had become very ill. They took her back to Brno, but her health worsened.

Janáček expressed his painful feelings for his daughter in a new work, his opera &quot;Jenůfa&quot;, in which the suffering of his daughter had transfigured into Jenůfa&#x27;s. When Olga died in February 1903, Janáček dedicated &quot;Jenůfa&quot; to her memory. The opera was performed in Brno in 1904, with reasonable success, but Janáček felt this was no more than a provincial achievement. He aspired to recognition by the more influential Prague opera, but &quot;Jenůfa&quot; was refused there (twelve years passed before its first performance in Prague). Dejected and emotionally exhausted, Janáček went to Luhačovice spa to recover. There he met Kamila Urválková, whose love story supplied the theme for his next opera, &quot;Osud&quot; (&quot;Destiny&quot;).

In 1905, Janáček attended a demonstration in support of a Czech university in Brno, where the violent death of František Pavlík, a young joiner, at the hands of the police inspired his piano sonata, &quot;1. X. 1905&quot; (&quot;From The Street&quot;). The incident led him to further promote the anti-German and anti-Austrian ethos of the &quot;Russian Circle&quot;, which he had co-founded in 1897 and which would be officially banned by the Austrian police in 1915. In 1906, he approached the Czech poet Petr Bezruč, with whom he later collaborated, composing several choral works based on Bezruč&#x27;s poetry. These included &quot;Kantor Halfar&quot; (1906), &quot;Maryčka Magdónova&quot; (1908), and &quot;70.000&quot; (1909).

Janáček&#x27;s life in the first decade of the 20th century was complicated by personal and professional difficulties. He still yearned for artistic recognition from Prague. He destroyed some of his works, others remained unfinished. Nevertheless, he continued composing, and would create several remarkable choral, chamber, orchestral and operatic works, the most notable being the 1914 cantata, &quot;Věčné evangelium&quot; (&quot;The Eternal Gospel&quot;), &quot;Pohádka&quot; (&quot;Fairy tale&quot;) for &#x27;cello and piano (1910), the 1912 piano cycle &quot;V mlhách&quot; (&quot;In the Mists&quot;), his violin sonata, and his first symphonic poem &quot;Šumařovo dítě&quot; (&quot;A Fiddler&#x27;s Child&quot;). His fifth opera, &quot;Výlet pana Broučka do měsíce&quot;, composed from 1908 to 1917, has been characterized as the most &quot;purely Czech in subject and treatment&quot; of all of Janáček&#x27;s operas.

=== 1916–1928: Breakthrough and masterworks ===
In 1916, he started a long professional and personal relationship with theatre critic, dramatist and translator Max Brod. In the same year, &quot;Jenůfa&quot;, revised by Kovařovic, was finally accepted by the National Theatre. Its performance in Prague in 1916 was a great success, and brought Janáček his first acclaim.
Following the Prague première, he began a relationship with singer Gabriela Horváthová, which led to his wife Zdenka&#x27;s attempted suicide and their &quot;informal&quot; divorce. A year later (1917), he met Kamila Stösslová, a young married woman 38 years his junior, who was to inspire him for the remaining years of his life. He conducted an obsessive and (on his side at least) passionate correspondence with her, of nearly 730 letters. From 1917 to 1919, deeply inspired by Stösslová, he composed &quot;The Diary of One Who Disappeared&quot;. As he completed its final revision, he began his next &#x27;Kamila&#x27; work, the opera &quot;Káťa Kabanová&quot;.

In 1920, Janáček retired from his post as director of the Brno Conservatory but continued to teach until 1925. In 1921, he attended a lecture by the Indian philosopher-poet Rabindranath Tagore and used a Tagore poem as the basis for the chorus &quot;The Wandering Madman&quot; (1922). In the early 1920s, Janáček completed his opera &quot;The Cunning Little Vixen&quot;, which had been inspired by a serialized novella by Rudolf Těsnohlídek in the newspaper Lidové noviny.

In Janáček&#x27;s 70th year (1924), his biography was published by Max Brod, and he was interviewed by Olin Downes for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 1925, he retired from teaching but continued composing and was awarded the first honorary doctorate to be given by Masaryk University in Brno. In the spring of 1926, he created his Sinfonietta, a monumental orchestral work, which rapidly gained wide critical acclaim. In the same year, he went to England at the invitation of Rosa Newmarch. A number of his works were performed in London, including his first string quartet, the wind sextet &quot;Youth&quot;, and his violin sonata. Shortly after, and still in 1926, he started to compose a setting to an Old Church Slavonic text. The result was the large-scale orchestral &quot;Glagolitic Mass&quot;.

The world première of Janáček&#x27;s lyrical Concertino for piano, two violins, viola, clarinet, French horn and bassoon took place in Brno in 1926. Around the same time, Janáček began work on a comparable chamber work for an even more unusual set of instruments, the Capriccio for piano left hand, flute, two trumpets, three trombones and tenor tuba, was written for pianist Otakar Hollmann, who lost the use of his right hand during World War I. It premièred in Prague on 2 March 1928.

In 1927 – the year of the Sinfonietta&#x27;s first performances in New York, Berlin and Brno – he began to compose his final operatic work, &quot;From the House of the Dead&quot;, the third act of which would be found on his desk after his death. In January 1928, he began his second string quartet, the &quot;Intimate Letters&quot;, his &quot;manifesto on love&quot;. Meanwhile, the Sinfonietta was performed in London, Vienna and Dresden. In his later years, Janáček became an international celebrity. He became a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin in 1927, along with Arnold Schoenberg and Paul Hindemith.

=== Death and funeral ===
In August 1928, he took an excursion to Štramberk with Kamila Stösslová and her son Otto, but caught a chill which developed into pneumonia. He died on 12 August 1928 in Ostrava, at the sanatorium of Dr. L. Klein, at the age of 74. He was given a large public funeral that included music from the last scene of his &quot;Cunning Little Vixen&quot;. He was buried in the Field of Honour at the Central Cemetery, Brno.

== Personality ==
Janáček worked tirelessly throughout his life. He led the organ school, was a professor at the teachers institute and grammar school in Brno, and collected transcriptions of folk songs, conversations and animal vocalisations, all while composing. From an early age, he presented himself as an individualist and his firmly formulated opinions often led to conflict. He unhesitatingly criticized his teachers, who considered him a defiant and anti-authoritarian student, yet his own students found him to be strict and uncompromising. Vilém Tauský, one of his pupils, described his encounters with Janáček as somewhat distressing for someone unused to his personality and noted that Janáček&#x27;s characteristically staccato speech rhythms were reproduced in some of his operatic characters. In 1881, Janáček gave up his leading role with the &quot;Beseda brněnská&quot;, as a response to criticism, but a rapid decline in &quot;Beseda&quot;&#x27;s performance quality led to his recall in 1882.

His married life, settled and calm in its early years, became increasingly tense and difficult following the death of his daughter, Olga, in 1903. Years of effort in obscurity took their toll, and almost ended his ambitions as a composer: &quot;I was beaten down&quot;, he wrote later, &quot;My own students gave me advice – how to compose, how to speak through the orchestra&quot;. Success in 1916 – when Karel Kovařovic finally decided to perform &quot;Jenůfa&quot; in Prague – brought its own problems. Janáček grudgingly resigned himself to the changes forced upon his work. Its success brought him into Prague&#x27;s music scene and the attentions of soprano , who guided him through Prague society. Janáček was enchanted by her. On his return to Brno, he appears not to have concealed his new passion from Zdenka, who responded by attempting suicide. That Christmas, after Janáček suspected Zdenka of sending Horvátová an anonymous letter, Zdenka tried to instigate a divorce, but the couple agreed to settle for an &quot;informal&quot; divorce. From then on, until Janáček&#x27;s death, they lived separate lives in the same household. Eventually Janáček lost interest in Horvátová.

In 1917, he began his lifelong, inspirational and unrequited passion for Kamila Stösslová, who neither sought nor rejected his devotion. Janáček pleaded for first-name terms in their correspondence. In 1927, she finally agreed and signed herself &quot;&quot; (Your Kamila) in a letter, which Zdenka found. This revelation provoked a furious quarrel between Zdenka and Janáček, though their living arrangements did not change – Janáček seems to have persuaded her to stay. In 1928, the year of his death, Janáček confessed his intention to publicize his feelings for Stösslová. Max Brod had to dissuade him. Janáček&#x27;s contemporaries and collaborators described him as mistrustful and reserved, but capable of obsessive passion for those he loved. His overwhelming passion for Stösslová was sincere but verged upon self-destruction. Their letters remain an important source for Janáček&#x27;s artistic intentions and inspiration. His letters to his long-suffering wife are, by contrast, mundanely descriptive. Zdenka seems to have destroyed all hers to Janáček. Only a few postcards survive.

== Style ==

In 1874, Janáček became friends with Antonín Dvořák, and began composing in a relatively traditional Romantic style. After his opera &quot;Šárka&quot; (1887–1888), his style absorbed elements of Moravian and Slovak folk music.

His musical assimilation of the rhythm, pitch contour and inflections of normal Czech speech (specifically Moravian dialects) helped create the very distinctive vocal melodies of his opera &quot;Jenůfa&quot; (1904), whose 1916 success in Prague was the turning point in his career. In &quot;Jenůfa&quot;, Janáček developed and applied the concept of &quot;speech melodies&quot; () to build a unique musical and dramatic style quite independent of &quot;Wagnerian&quot; dramatic method. He studied the circumstances in which &quot;speech melodies&quot; changed, the psychology and temperament of speakers and the coherence within speech, all of which helped render the dramatically truthful roles of his mature operas, and became one of the most significant markers of his style. Janáček took these stylistic principles much farther in his vocal writing than Modest Mussorgsky, and thus anticipates the later work of Béla Bartók. The stylistic basis for his later works originates in the period of 1904–1918, but Janáček composed most of his output – and his best known works – in the last decade of his life.
Much of Janáček&#x27;s work displays great originality and individuality. It employs a vastly expanded view of tonality, uses unorthodox chord spacings and structures, and often, modality: &quot;there is no music without key. Atonality abolishes definite key, and thus tonal modulation... Folksong knows of no atonality.&quot; Janáček features accompaniment figures and patterns, with (according to Jim Samson) &quot;the on-going movement of his music...similarly achieved by unorthodox means; often a discourse of short, &#x27;unfinished&#x27; phrases comprising constant repetitions of short motifs which gather momentum in a cumulative manner.&quot; Janáček named these motifs &quot; (singular ) in his theoretical works. &quot; has no strict English equivalent, but John Tyrrell, a leading specialist on Janáček&#x27;s music, describes it as &quot;a little flash of time, almost a kind of musical capsule, which Janáček often used in slow music as tiny swift motifs with remarkably characteristic rhythms that are supposed to pepper the musical flow.&quot; Janáček&#x27;s use of these repeated motifs demonstrates a remote similarity to minimalist composers (Charles Mackerras called Janáček &quot;the first minimalist composer&quot;).

== Inspiration ==
=== Folklore ===
Janáček was deeply influenced by folklore and Eastern European folk music, and by Moravian folk music in particular, but not by the pervasive, idealized 19th century romantic folklore variant. He took a realistic, descriptive and analytic approach to the material. Moravian folk songs, compared with their Bohemian counterparts, are much freer and more irregular in their metrical and rhythmic structure, and more varied in their melodic intervals. In his study of Moravian modes, Janáček found that the peasant musicians did not know the names of the modes and had their own ways of referring to them. He used the term &quot;Moravian modulation&quot; to describe the harmonic progression I–VII, which he considered a general characteristic of this region&#x27;s folk music.

Janáček partly composed the original piano accompaniments to more than 150 folk songs, respectful of their original function and context, and partly used folk inspiration in his own works, especially in his mature compositions. His work in this area was not stylistically imitative; instead, he developed a new and original musical aesthetic based on a deep study of the fundamentals of folk music.

=== Russia ===
Janáček&#x27;s deep and lifelong affection for Russia and Russian culture represents another important element of his musical inspiration. In 1888 he attended the Prague performance of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music, and met the older composer. Janáček profoundly admired Tchaikovsky, and particularly appreciated his highly developed musical thought in connection with the use of Russian folk motifs. Janáček&#x27;s Russian inspiration is especially apparent in his later chamber, symphonic and operatic output. He closely followed developments in Russian music from his early years, and in 1896, following his first visit to Russia, he founded a &quot;Russian Circle&quot; in Brno. Janáček read Russian authors in their original language. Their literature offered him an enormous and reliable source of inspiration, though this did not blind him to the problems of Russian society. He was twenty-two years old when he wrote his first composition based on a Russian theme: a melodrama, &quot;Death&quot;, set to Lermontov&#x27;s poem. In his later works, he often used literary models with sharply contoured plots. In 1910 Zhukovsky&#x27;s &quot;Tale of Tsar Berendei&quot; inspired him to write the &quot;Fairy Tale for Cello and Piano&quot;. He composed the rhapsody &quot;Taras Bulba&quot; (1918) to Gogol&#x27;s short story, and five years later, in 1923, completed his first string quartet, inspired by Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Kreutzer Sonata&quot;. Two of his later operas were based on Russian themes: &quot;Káťa Kabanová&quot;, composed in 1921 to Alexander Ostrovsky&#x27;s play &quot;The Storm&quot;, and his last work, &quot;From the House of the Dead&quot;, which transformed Dostoevsky&#x27;s vision of the world into an exciting collective drama.

=== Other composers ===
One of Janáček&#x27;s early influences was Antonín Dvořák, whom he always deeply admired and to whom he dedicated some of his works. He rearranged part of Dvořák&#x27;s Moravian Duets for mixed choir with original piano accompaniment. In the early years of the 20th century, Janáček became increasingly interested in the music of other European composers. His opera &quot;Destiny&quot; was a response to another significant and famous work in contemporary Bohemia – &quot;Louise&quot;, by the French composer Gustave Charpentier. The influence of Giacomo Puccini is apparent particularly in Janáček&#x27;s later works, for example in his opera &quot;Káťa Kabanová&quot;. Although he carefully observed developments in European music, his operas remained firmly connected with Czech and Slavic themes.

== Publications ==

Janáček published music theory works, essays and articles over a period of fifty years, from 1877 to 1927. He wrote and edited the journal, and contributed to many specialist music journals, such as &quot;Cecílie&quot;, &quot;Hlídka&quot; and &quot;Dalibor&quot;. He also completed several extensive studies, as (The Complete Harmony Theory), (On the Construction of Chords and Their Connections) and (Basics of Musical &quot;Sčasování&quot;). In his essays and books, Janáček examined various musical topics, forms, melody and harmony theories, dyad and triad chords, counterpoint (or &quot;opora&quot;, meaning &quot;support&quot;) and devoted himself to the study of the mental composition. His theoretical works stress the Czech term &quot;sčasování&quot;, Janáček&#x27;s specific word for rhythm, which has relation to time ( in Czech), and the handling of time in music composition. He distinguished several types of rhythm (&quot;sčasovka&quot;): &quot; (sounding) – meaning any rhythm, &quot; (counting) – meaning smaller units measuring the course of rhythm; and &quot;&quot; (summing) – a long value comprising the length of a rhythmical unit. Janáček used the combination of their mutual action widely in his own works.

As well as his contributions to music journals, Janáček also wrote essays, reports, reviews, feuilletons, articles and books, regularly contributing such content to local newspapers in Brno. His work in this area comprises around 380 individual items. Janáček&#x27;s literary legacy represents an important illustration of his life, public work and art.

== Folk music research ==
Janáček came from a region characterized by its deeply rooted folk culture, which he explored as a young student under Pavel Křížkovský. His meeting with the folklorist and dialectologist František Bartoš (1837–1906) was decisive in his own development as a folklorist and composer, and led to their collaborative and systematic collections of folk songs. Janáček became an important collector in his own right, especially of Lachian, Moravian Slovakian, Moravian Wallachian and Slovakian songs. From 1879, his collections included transcribed speech intonations. He was one of the organizers of the &quot;Czech-Slavic Folklore Exhibition&quot;, an important event in Czech culture at the end of 19th century. From 1905 he was President of the newly instituted &quot;Working Committee for Czech National Folksong in Moravia and Silesia&quot;, a branch of the Austrian institute &quot;Das Volkslied in Österreich&quot; (Folksong in Austria), which was established in 1902 by the Viennese publishing house Universal Edition. Janáček was a pioneer and propagator of ethnographic photography in Moravia and Silesia. In October 1909 he acquired an Edison phonograph and became one of the first to use phonographic recording as a folklore research tool. Several of these recording sessions have been preserved, and were reissued in 1998.

== Criticism ==

Czech musicology at the beginning of the 20th century was strongly influenced by Romanticism, in particular by the styles of Wagner and Smetana. Performance practices were conservative, and actively resistant to stylistic innovation. During his lifetime, Janáček reluctantly conceded to Karel Kovařovic&#x27;s instrumental rearrangement of &quot;Jenůfa&quot;, most noticeably in the finale, in which Kovařovic added a more &quot;festive&quot; sound of trumpets and French horns, and doubled some instruments to support Janáček&#x27;s &quot;poor&quot; instrumentation. The score of &quot;Jenůfa&quot; was later restored by Charles Mackerras, and is now performed according to Janáček&#x27;s original intentions.

Another important Czech musicologist, Zdeněk Nejedlý, a great admirer of Smetana and later a communist Minister of Culture, condemned Janáček as an author who could accumulate a lot of material, but was unable to do anything with it. He called Janáček&#x27;s style &quot;unanimated&quot;, and his operatic duets &quot;only speech melodies&quot;, without polyphonic strength. Nejedlý considered Janáček rather an amateurish composer, whose music did not conform to the style of Smetana. According to Charles Mackerras, he tried to destroy Janáček professionally. In 2006 Josef Bartoš, the Czech aesthetician and music critic, described Janáček as a &quot;musical eccentric&quot; who clung tenaciously to an imperfect, improvising style, but Bartoš appreciated some elements of Janáček&#x27;s works and judged him more positively than Nejedlý.

Janáček&#x27;s friend and collaborator Václav Talich, former chief-conductor of the Czech Philharmonic, sometimes adjusted Janáček&#x27;s scores, mainly for their instrumentation and dynamics; some critics sharply attacked him for doing so. Talich re-orchestrated &quot;Taras Bulba&quot; and the Suite from &quot;Cunning Little Vixen&quot; justifying the latter with the claim that &quot;it was not possible to perform it in the Prague National Theatre unless it was entirely re-orchestrated&quot;. Talich&#x27;s rearrangement rather emasculated the specific sounds and contrasts of Janáček&#x27;s original, but was the standard version for many years. Charles Mackerras started to research Janáček&#x27;s music in the 1960s, and gradually restored the composer&#x27;s distinctive scoring. The critical edition of Janáček&#x27;s scores is published by the Czech &quot;Editio Janáček&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Janáček belongs to a wave of twentieth-century composers who sought greater realism and greater connection with everyday life, combined with a more all-encompassing use of musical resources. His operas, in particular, demonstrate the use of &quot;speech&quot;-derived melodic lines, folk and traditional material, and complex modal musical argument. He would also inspire music theorists (among them Jaroslav Volek) to place modal development at the same level of importance as harmony in music. Along with Dvořák and Smetana, he is generally considered one of the most important Czech composers.

The operas of his mature period, &quot;Jenůfa&quot; (1904), &quot;Káťa Kabanová&quot; (1921), &quot;The Cunning Little Vixen&quot; (1924), &quot;The Makropulos Affair&quot; (1926) and &quot;From the House of the Dead&quot; (after a novel by Dostoevsky and premièred posthumously in 1930) are considered his finest works. The Australian conductor Sir Charles Mackerras became very closely associated with Janáček&#x27;s operas.

Janáček&#x27;s chamber music, while not especially voluminous, includes works which are widely considered twentieth-century classics, particularly his two string quartets: Quartet No. 1, &quot;The Kreutzer Sonata&quot; inspired by the Tolstoy novel, and the Quartet No. 2, &quot;Intimate Letters&quot;. Milan Kundera called these compositions the peak of Janáček&#x27;s output.

Janáček established a school of composition in Brno. Among his notable pupils were Jan Kunc, Václav Kaprál, Vilém Petrželka, Jaroslav Kvapil, Osvald Chlubna, Břetislav Bakala and Pavel Haas. Most of his students neither imitated nor developed Janáček&#x27;s style, which left him no direct stylistic descendants. According to Milan Kundera, Janáček developed a personal, modern style in relative isolation from contemporary modernist movements but was in close contact with developments in modern European music. His path towards the innovative &quot;modernism&quot; of his later years was long and solitary, and he achieved true individuation as a composer around his 50th year.
Sir Charles Mackerras, the Australian conductor who helped promote Janáček&#x27;s works on the world&#x27;s opera stages, described his style as &quot;... completely new and original, different from anything else ... and impossible to pin down to any one style&quot;. According to Mackerras, Janáček&#x27;s use of whole-tone scale differs from that of Debussy, his folk music inspiration is absolutely dissimilar from Dvořák&#x27;s and Smetana&#x27;s, and his characteristically complex rhythms differ from the techniques of the young Stravinsky.

The French conductor and composer Pierre Boulez, who interpreted Janáček&#x27;s operas and orchestral works, called his music surprisingly modern and fresh: &quot;Its repetitive pulse varies through changes in rhythm, tone and direction.&quot; He described his opera &quot;From the House of the Dead&quot; as &quot;primitive, in the best sense, but also extremely strong, like the paintings of Léger, where the rudimentary character allows a very vigorous kind of expression&quot;.

The Czech conductor, composer and writer Jaroslav Vogel wrote what was for a long time considered the standard biography of Janáček in 1958. It first appeared in German translation, and in the Czech original in 1963. The first English translation came out in 1962 and it was later re-issued, in a version revised by Karel Janovický, in 1981. Charles Mackerras regarded it as his &quot;Janáček bible&quot;.

Janáček&#x27;s life has been featured in several films. In 1974 Eva Marie Kaňková made a short documentary &quot;Fotograf a muzika&quot; (The Photographer and the Music) about the Czech photographer Josef Sudek and his relationship to Janáček&#x27;s work. In 1983 the Brothers Quay produced a stop motion animated film, &quot;Leoš Janáček: Intimate Excursions&quot;, about Janáček&#x27;s life and work, and in 1986 the Czech director Jaromil Jireš made &quot;Lev s bílou hřívou&quot; (Lion with the White Mane), which showed the amorous inspiration behind Janáček&#x27;s works. &quot;In Search of Janáček&quot; is a Czech documentary directed in 2004 by Petr Kaňka, made to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Janáček&#x27;s birth. An animated cartoon version of &quot;The Cunning Little Vixen&quot; was made in 2003 by the BBC, with music performed by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin and conducted by Kent Nagano. A re-arrangement of the opening of the &quot;Sinfonietta&quot; was used by the progressive rock band Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer for the song &quot;Knife-Edge&quot; on their 1970 debut album.

The Janáček Philharmonic Orchestra was established in 1954. Today the 116-piece ensemble is associated with mostly contemporary music but also regularly performs works from the classical repertoire. The orchestra is resident at the House of Culture Vítkovice (Dům kultury Vítkovice) in Ostrava, Czech Republic. The orchestra tours extensively and has performed in Europe, the U.S., Australia, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

Asteroid 2073 Janáček, discovered in 1974 by Luboš Kohoutek, is named in his honor. The Haruki Murakami novel &quot;1Q84&quot; (2009/2010) uses Janáček&#x27;s Sinfonietta as a recurring plot point. Ostrava&#x27;s international airport was renamed after Janáček in November 2006.

== Business ==
As the county seat of Juniata County, Mifflintown serves as the county&#x27;s center of business and government. Given the borough&#x27;s small size, as well as the county&#x27;s small population, the presence of business and government remain limited. The Mifflintown borough boundaries limit the size of the community, meaning that retail and business functions necessarily spill over onto land of bordering municipalities.

Nevertheless, Mifflintown serves as the corporate headquarters of both the Juniata Valley Bank and Pennian Bank. Empire Kosher Poultry, the nation&#x27;s largest producer of kosher poultry, has both its headquarters and processing facility in adjoining Fermanagh Township.

Land surrounding Mifflintown serves as Juniata County&#x27;s retail center as well.

== Transportation ==

Pennsylvania Route 35, a southwest–northeast highway that serves as Juniata County&#x27;s principal arterial highway running in that direction, forms the main street of Mifflintown. It intersects the former mainline of US routes 22 and 322, which was moved in the early 1970s to a four-lane bypass lying east of the town. The former Pennsylvania Railroad mainline tracks, now owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway, lie across the Juniata River in the adjoining town of Mifflin.

== Education ==
Mifflintown is the home of Juniata High School, which serves the southern half of Juniata County. Tuscarora Junior High School and Juniata Elementary School are also located in the town.

<text>Port Royal is a borough in Juniata County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 815 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Port Royal used to be named Perrysville, after Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry. At the time, the Port Royal post office was located in Saint Tammany town, just across the Tuscarora Creek. However, the Pennsylvania Railroad brought increased traffic through the area and prompted a move of the Port Royal post office into Perrysville in 1847. In 1874, the borough took on the name itself and Saint Tammany became known as Old Port.

Throughout the history of Port Royal, the general population was almost centered around agriculture. The rural counties within Port Royal include Turbett, Spruce Hill and Milford Townships, otherwise known as the Tuscarora Valley.

Port Royal (and Perrysville before it) once was a stop on the old main line of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Port Royal was, in fact, one of the first towns to be linked to the Pennsylvania Railroad system, as it lay along the Lewistown-to-Harrisburg stretch of the railroad—the first leg constructed after the new railroad was chartered. Located along the Juniata River, many forms of transportation passed through the small town as a result of the river being an essential transportation &quot;highway&quot; before automobiles.

However, the Pennsylvania Railroad station no longer exists. Port Royal was also the northern terminus of the Tuscarora Valley Railroad, a narrow-gauge railroad serving southern Juniata and northern Franklin counties. The railroad was decommissioned in the 1930s.

From the PRR station during the Gettysburg Campaign of the Civil War, Union scout Stephen W. Pomeroy telegraphed the vital news to Governor Andrew Curtin that Robert E. Lee was concentrating the Army of Northern Virginia at Gettysburg. This was how state officials learned of this vital intelligence, which Pomeroy had carried for nearly sixty miles from near Lee&#x27;s headquarters in Chambersburg. He had sewn the message into his belt strap of his pants.

==Geography==
Port Royal is located at (40.533257, -77.387619).

Port Royal is located 40 miles northwest of Harrisburg. It has been depicted as the &quot;halfway&quot; mark between the Harrisburg capitol city and State College, home of Penn State.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and (4.35%) is water.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 977 people, 398 households, and 278 families residing in the borough. The population density was . There were 434 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the borough was 95.70% White, 1.33% African American, 0.61% Native American, 0.41% Asian, 1.54% from other races, and 0.41% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.89% of the population.

There were 398 households, out of which 32.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.0% were married couples living together, 10.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.9% were non-families. 26.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 12.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.45 and the average family size was 2.92.

In the borough the population was spread out, with 26.0% under the age of 18, 7.3% from 18 to 24, 30.4% from 25 to 44, 20.9% from 45 to 64, and 15.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females there were 93.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.8 males.

The median income for a household in the borough was $34,514, and the median income for a family was $39,479. Males had a median income of $28,750 versus $22,841 for females.

About 8.2% of families and 10.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 11.1% of those under age 18 and 6.7% of those age 65 or over.

==Juniata County Fair==
The first fair was held in Port Royal in 1852 and there has been an annual fair in the town thereafter. In 1887 the original fairgrounds south of town were found to lack adequate space and a larger tract of land was purchased north of the town, from Smith Kepner, in what is now known as the Juniata County Fair Grounds. Beginning as primarily a showcase for agrarian enterprise, the fair has slowly changed so that today it has much less of its agrarian roots. In 1953 weekly summer automobile racing began on a track that was originally built for horse racing and this activity has played a large part in focusing attention on the town during the summer months.

<text>Hay-on-Wye, or simply Hay (; or simply ), is a market town and community in Powys, Wales, in the historic county of Brecknockshire. With over twenty bookshops, it is often described as a &quot;town of books&quot;; it is both the National Book Town of Wales and the site of the annual Hay Festival. The community had a population of 1,675 at the 2021 census.

The town is twinned with Redu, a village in the Belgian municipality of Libin, and with Timbuktu, Mali, West Africa. 

Hay-on-Wye is often named one of the best places to live in Wales and has been named as one of the UK&#x27;s best Christmas destinations. 

==Location==
The town lies on the south-east bank of the River Wye and is within the north-easternmost tip of the Brecon Beacons National Park, just north of the Black Mountains. The town is just on the Welsh side of the border with Herefordshire, England, here defined by the Dulas Brook. Where the brook joins the River Wye just north of the town, the border continues northwards along the river. The Wye was the boundary between the former counties and districts of Radnorshire and Brecknockshire.

The adjacent parish of Cusop lies on the English side of the Dulas Brook, with parts of the urban area of Hay now crossing the border into the parish of Cusop. The nearest city is Hereford, county town of Herefordshire, some to the east. Hereford serves as the post town for Hay, so that its official postal address is &quot;Hay-on-Wye, Hereford&quot;, despite Hay being in Wales and Hereford in England.

Hay-on-Wye is in the area known as &quot;Kilvert country&quot; which includes Clyro, Capel-y-ffin, Llowes, Glasbury, Llanigon, Painscastle, Clifford and Whitney-on-Wye.

==Etymology==
The settlement&#x27;s name is first referred to between 1135 and 1147 as ; in 1299 the name of is used. By the 16th century it was simply called &quot;Hay&quot;, and the use of the river as a suffix is a later addition. In 1215, a Welsh name, was recorded, and in 1614; the two names may have been used concurrently in 1625. The English language name, &quot;Hay&quot;, is derived from Old English , possibly meaning a &quot;fenced area&quot; and a noun used in late Saxon and Norman times for an enclosure in a forest. The Welsh word (lenited to ) has a range of meanings, including wooded areas of various extents.

The legal name of the community is Hay rather than Hay-on-Wye. In 1947 the General Post Office changed the name of the postal locality from Hay to Hay-on-Wye. The change of postal address did not change the name of the urban district which then covered the town, which retained the name Hay and was subsequently converted into a community called Hay in 1974.

==History==

The village of Llanigon is about south-west of the town of Hay-on-Wye. Before the Norman conquest Hay-on-Wye was part of the parish of Llanigon. The church of St. Eigon in Llanigon was the principal church for the area. This was because the settlement in Llanigon predated the settlement in Hay-on-Wye.
Brycheiniog (now Wales) was conquered between 1088 and 1095 following the second Norman invasion of Wales. The Norman invaders were led by the marcher lord Bernard de Neufmarché. He divided Brycheiniog into smaller lordships which were gifted to the knights who contributed to the conquest. The Llanthomas lordship (in Llanigon) was part of the Hay lordship owned by William Revel, one of Bernard &#x27;s knights. Motte and bailey castle construction typically occurred soon after a lordship was allocated to a knight.

Hay-on-Wye grew after the conquest. Around 1121, a motte and bailey castle was built near St. Mary&#x27;s. It is thought to have been built by William Revel. The castle remains are known as Hay Tump. The church of St Mary&#x27;s was built around 1135 and took over the role of the principle church and parish for the area. St. Mary&#x27;s is near Login Brook and the River Wye.

The main part of the town was subsequently developed on a spur of land between the River Wye and Dulas Brook, about 200 metres east of Hay Tump. The town was fortified with walls and defended by Hay Castle, which appears to have been built from the late 12th century onwards. The earlier centre of settlement around Hay Tump and St Mary&#x27;s Church lay outside the later town walls. A chapel dedicated to St John was subsequently built inside the town walls around 1254.

In post-conquest times, Hay-on-Wye was divided between two manors, known as an Englishry (i.e. English Hay or Haya Anglicana) and a Welshery (i.e. Welsh Hay or Haya Wallensis). The Englishry was within the fortified town of Hay. The &quot;Welshry&quot; &quot;was&quot; outside the fortified town, including some rural land, the village of Llanigon and the hamlet of Glynfach.

In 1894, Hay Urban parish was created from part of the Hay Urban District, Hay Tump is within the Hay Urban parish&quot;.&quot; Hay Rural parish was created from the rural part of the parish of Hay, and includes another Norman castle called Llanthomas Castle Mound. It is on the same lane as the Hay Festival fields (Dairy Meadows). D. J. Cathcart King’s list of UK castles, names Hay Castle as Hay No. 1, Hay Tump as Hay No. 2 and Llanthomas Castle Mound as Hay No. 3.

Hay Castle initially took the form of an earth ringwork with a stone gate-tower. It was re-enforced in stone around 1200 with a curtain wall. The castle was damaged during the Welsh rebellion led by Owain Glyndŵr around 1401 and again in 1460 during the Wars of the Roses. It was then substantially expanded in the 17th century, creating a Jacobean mansion. Hay Castle has recently been restored to its former glory.

==Book town==
Hay-on-Wye is a destination for bibliophiles in the United Kingdom, with two dozen bookshops, many selling specialist and second-hand books, although the number has declined sharply in recent years, many becoming general antique shops and similar. Hay-on-Wye was already well known for its many bookshops before the festival was launched. Richard Booth opened his first shop there, called The Old Fire Station, in 1962, and by the 1970s Hay had gained the nickname &quot;The Town of Books&quot;.
===Hay Festival===
Since 1988, the Hay Festival based in Hay-on-Wye has been the venue for an annual literary festival, now sponsored by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper, which draws a claimed 80,000 visitors over ten days at the end of May or beginning of June to see and hear big literary names from all over the world. Devised by Norman, Rhoda and Peter Florence in 1988, the festival was described by Bill Clinton in 2001 as &quot;The Woodstock of the mind&quot;. Tony Benn said: &quot;In my mind it&#x27;s replaced Christmas&quot;. In late July 2021, co-founder and director Peter Florence resigned as Festival Director.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Hay, at community (town) and county level: Hay Town Council and Powys County Council. The town council is based at offices on Brecon Road. For elections to Powys County Council, there is a ward called Hay which covers the same area as the community of Hay.

===Administrative history===
The parish of Hay was created around 1135 from the north-eastern parts of the older parish of Llanigon. Until 1536 Hay was a marcher lordship. In 1536 the Hay lordship was included in the new county of Brecknockshire.

The area of the fortified town was sometimes described as a borough, but it was never given a charter and it appears that no borough council ever operated; instead the town was administered by officials appointed by the lord of the manor. Any residual claim Hay may have had to be called a borough was extinguished under the Municipal Corporations Act 1883.

In 1864 the north-eastern part of the parish of Hay, covering the built-up area as it then was and some adjacent areas, was made a local government district, administered by an elected local board. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. The 1894 Act also directed that parishes were no longer allowed to straddle district boundaries, and so the parish of Hay was split into a Hay Urban parish covering the same area as the urban district, and a Hay Rural parish covering the part of the old parish outside the urban district.

Hay Urban District was abolished in 1974, with its area instead becoming a community called Hay within the Borough of Brecknock in the new county of Powys. The former urban district council&#x27;s functions therefore passed to Brecknock Borough Council, which was in turn abolished in 1996 and its functions passed to Powys County Council. The Hay Rural parish also became a community in 1974, but was abolished in 1986 and its area absorbed into the neighbouring parish of Llanigon.

==Transport==
The B4350 runs through the town and the B4351 links it with the main A438 from Brecon to Hereford, on the far side of the River Wye. The town has a road/pedestrian bridge spanning the River Wye linking Clyro with Hay-on-Wye.

The town was formerly served by train services at Hay-on-Wye railway station on the Hereford, Hay and Brecon line. On a stormy night in 1880, a goods train on the way to Brecon was derailed and destroyed a 3-arch masonry bridge. The train fell into Digeddi Brook at Little Ffordd Fawr, near Llanigon. The driver George Parker died, and his stoker John Williams had life changing injuries. The line closed in 1962, due to the line&#x27;s commercial underperformance.

==Sport==

Hay St. Mary&#x27;s Football Club is based on Hay Sports Field, off Brecon Road, and they compete in the Central Wales Football League. 

Hay-on-Wye Cricket Club is also located on Hay Sports Field. The 1st team compete in The Marches Cricket League. 

Hay-on-Wye bowling club is affiliated to the Mid Wales Bowling Association and the Women&#x27;s Mid Wales Bowling Association. 

Hay Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1903. The club continued on its nine-hole course until the onset of World War II.

==Music and philosophy==

Hay hosts a philosophy and music festival, HowTheLightGetsIn, which occurs annually in May. It aims &quot;to get philosophy out of the academy and into people&#x27;s lives.&quot;

== Notable buildings ==

In 2013, Hay-on-Wye had 145 Listed Building entries, all are Grade II listed apart from Hay Castle which is Grade 1 listed. Other listed buildings include St Mary&#x27;s parish church, Dulas Bridge (Newport St), the Swan Hotel(Church St), Harley’s Almshouses (4 Brecon Rd), Post Office (3 High Town), Ashbrook House (1 Brecon Rd) and part of the town wall, as well as many of the town centre inns and shops. Oakfield is a Grade II listed Regency house located south of the town centre: built in about 1820, it was recorded in 1842 as the home of Henry Allen Junior.The Butter Market was commissioned by William Enoch and erected in the form of a Doric temple in 1833. the Cheese Market was commissioned by Sir Joseph Bailey, 1st Baronet and completed in 1835. The Butter Market and the Cheese Market had an arcaded ground floor to sell butter and cheese and dairy products, respectively. The first-floor assembly room has now been renovated to serve as holiday accommodation. On the end wall is a sculpture of Henry Tudor (Henry VII).

* St. Mary&#x27;s Church (Church in Wales) which serves other local churches including St. John’s Chapel, Hay-on-Wye, St Eigon, Llanigon, St. Mary’s, Capel-y-Ffin etc.
* St. Joseph&#x27;s Church (Roman Catholic) was repurposed from the Tabernacle Calvinistic Methodist (Presbyterian Church of Wales). From 1925 to 1968, Mass was celebrated in the hired assembly room over the Cheese Market. 
* Bethesda Evangelical Church was repurposed from the Bethesda Primitive Methodist Chapel.
Churches that have been repurposed for secular purposes include:

Hay-on-Wye has a Victorian clock tower about 50 ft high. The tower was erected in 1881 at a cost of £300. It is built of dressed Bath stone and native stone from Christfield quarry. It was known by locals as the &quot;clockless tower&quot;. The clock faces and bell were added in 1884 after fund-raising by Canon Bevan and family. It was set going on Christmas Day 1884. The bell was paid by a donation as a memorial to T. W. Higgins, Hay, and Guidfa House, Radnorshire.

==Kingdom of Hay-on-Wye==

On 1 April 1977, bibliophile Richard Booth conceived a publicity stunt in which he declared Hay-on-Wye to be an &#x27;independent kingdom&#x27; with himself as its monarch and a National Anthem written by Les Penning. The tongue-in-cheek micronation of Hay-on-Wye has subsequently developed a healthy tourism industry based on literary interests for which some credit Booth.

In 2005, Booth announced plans to sell his bookshop and move to Germany; on this occasion, local Member of Parliament, Roger Williams, was quoted as saying: &quot;His legacy will be that Hay changed from a small market town into a mecca for second-hand book lovers and this transformed the local economy.&quot;

==History==
Originally a village in the original Abington Township, Abington Center was founded in the late 18th century by settlers from Connecticut, along the Warriors&#x27; Path. In 1854, it was incorporated as a borough named Waverly after Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novel of the same name, popular at that time. It was renamed because there was another municipality named Abington located near Philadelphia. The borough, located within Lackawanna County, gave up its charter in 1919 due to the high cost of upgrading its main street to a state highway, and became Abington Township.

Due to confusion between the Montgomery County township and Lacakwanna County&#x27;s North, South, and West Abington townships, township officials set up a ballot initiative to rename the municipality to Waverly based on one of its former names. On November 2, 2010, voters in the township overwhelmingly voted to change the township&#x27;s name to Waverly Township, with 706 voting for the change and 115 against.

<text>Carbondale is a city in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, United States. Carbondale is located approximately 15 miles due northeast of the city of Scranton in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The population was 8,828 at the 2020 census.

The land area that became Carbondale was developed by William and Maurice Wurts, the founders of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, during the rise of the anthracite coal mining industry in the early 19th century. It was also a major terminal of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad. Carbondale was the site of the first deep vein anthracite coal mine in the United States, and was the site of the Carbondale mine fire which burned from 1946 to the early 1970s.

Carbondale has struggled with the demise of the once-prominent coal mining industry that had once made the region a haven for immigrants seeking work. Immigrants from Wales, England, Scotland, Ireland, Italy and from continental Europe came to Carbondale in the 19th and early 20th centuries to work in the anthracite and railroading industries.

Carbondale is north of Allentown and northwest of New York City.

The Carbondale Historical Society and Museum records and maintains the city&#x27;s history. The Carbondale City Hall and Courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The Delaware and Hudson Canal Gravity Railroad Shops have been demolished, but were once listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Carbondale mine fire began in Carbondale in 1946. Every census since 1940 has seen a steady decline in the population of Carbondale, mostly attributed to the end of the coal industry in the area.

It is also the northern control city of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension, I-476, though the official terminus is in adjacent South Abington Township.

==History==
The first settler in the area currently known as Clarks Summit was William Clark. Clark had fought in the Battle of Bunker Hill during the Revolutionary War, and as payment for his military service, he was issued of Pennsylvania land by Congress. Because of disputes between Pennsylvania and Connecticut over the area of land that is now northern Pennsylvania (resulting in the Pennamite-Yankee War), the land deed issued to Clark was deemed invalid by the Luzerne County land grant office. Clark had no choice but to pay for the land himself. In March 1799, Clark and his three sons moved into a log cabin in the Abington wilderness, located on what is currently the Clarks Green Cemetery. The first school was built in 1893 and was destroyed by fire two years later. The village of Clarks Summit and an adjacent tract of land were incorporated into the Borough of Clarks Summit on August 30, 1911.

<doc id="132835" wikidata="Q1131902" url="?curid=132835" title="Dickson City, Pennsylvania">
<text>Dickson City is a borough in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, United States, north of Scranton. Coal mining was an important industry in the past. The borough&#x27;s population peaked at 12,395 in 1930 and was 6,051 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Dickson City was once known as Priceburg. It was the newest village in the valley and one of the most progressive. German immigrants then founded the village of Priceville in 1863, in honor of Eli Price. This section of the town developed rapidly after 1880, when John Jermyn sank the shaft which is now known as the Johnson shaft. Here the population had grown from 329 to 841.

In June 1875, Dickson City was incorporated as a borough, including at the time all of the present borough of Throop. Dickson City received its name from Thomas Dickson, founder of the Dickson Manufacturing Company.

Once dominated by coal mines, this borough has in recent times become the center of a thriving retail corridor focused along Business Route 6 and around the Viewmont Mall. Many of the nation&#x27;s big-box stores and chain restaurants are represented here.

Most of the newer retail complexes are located along Viewmont Drive and Commerce Boulevard, both built by developers to access the borough&#x27;s vast dormant coal lands. Some of the centers that were built in the 1990s and early 2000s include Dickson City Crossings, Dickson City Commons, Park Center and Commerce Plaza.

After Route 6 (also named the Scranton/Carbondale Highway), Main Street serves as the borough&#x27;s other major thoroughfare. It features a slightly older stock of stores, bars, professional offices and homes.

One point of major contention in the borough has been a swath of reclaimed coal-mining land south of Commerce Boulevard that was deeded to the borough for public use after the state government cleaned it up. Plans to build a bond-financed municipal golf course on the land launched during the early 2000s were scuttled after some borough council members campaigned against that form of borrowing and won the majority of seats. The land was seized by a local bank after interim loans went unpaid, but because the state stipulated that it has to remain in the hands of a municipality, neighboring borough Dunmore snapped it up.

==Geography==
Dickson City is located at (41.465984, -75.625401). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

Interstate 81 has two commercially-important exits in Dickson City—one with Main Avenue and one with the old 6 (the Scranton-Carbondale Highway.) The Viewmont Mall is in both Dickson City and Scranton. The geographic location of the center of business dictates the revenue, according to Pennsylvania tax law.

While the anthracite coal industry was thriving, there were numerous neighborhood schools: the Columbus School on Main Street between Bowman Street and Shaeffer Street, the Jefferson School on Bell Mountain where Center Street meets Laybourne Street, the Lafayette School on Main Street near Pancost Street, the Lincoln School at the corner of Lincoln Street and Grier Street, and the Wilson School at the corner of Boulevard Avenue and Bridge Street. Dickson City Junior High School was on a block on the block between Jackson Street and Jermyn Street and faced Albert Street; Dickson City Senior High School was next door and faced Carmalt Street.

As the population declined, the neighborhood schools were closed, and the junior high school became a kindergarten through 8th grade school. In 1969, the Olyphant, Dickson City, and Throop school districts consolidated to form the Mid Valley School District. Dickson City Junior High School became Mid-Valley Junior High School; Dickson City Senior High School became Dickson City Elementary School. Currently, the Mid-Valley School District has a single elementary school, and a single secondary school on Underwood Road in Throop.

Johnson Technical Institute is located just over the border in the nearby city, Scranton.

Dickson City is the location of one of the family service centers for Commonwealth Charter Academy, an online K-12 free public virtual charter school.

<text>Dunmore is a borough in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, United States, adjoining Scranton. It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania and was settled in 1835 and incorporated in 1862. Extensive anthracite coal, brick, stone, and silk interests had led to a rapid increase in the population from 8,315 in 1890 to 23,086 in 1940. The population was 14,042 in the 2020 census.

== History ==
Dunmore was settled in 1835, and incorporated in 1862.

The first European to set foot on Dunmore soil was Count Zinzendorf of Saxony, in 1742, as a missionary to the native people who were Munsee-speaking Delawares.

The territory now encompassing Dunmore was purchased from the natives in 1754 by the Susquehanna Company of Connecticut and became the township of Providence. The first settlers of the Dunmore area arrived in 1771 and were originally from Connecticut (see Pennamite–Yankee War). William Allsworth established an inn here in 1783. In the summer of 1795, Charles Dolph, John Carey, and John West began the labor of clearing and plowing lands in the neighborhood of &quot;Bucktown&quot; or &quot;Corners&quot;, as this area was called. Edward Lunnon, Isaac Dolph, James Brown, Philip Swartz and Levi De Puy, purchased land here between 1799–1805.

Stephen Tripp, in 1820, began the area&#x27;s first business, erecting a saw and grist mill on the Roaring Brook half a mile south of the village. That same year, the Drinker Turnpike Company opened a store at the Corners. Shortly after Joseph Tanner opened the first blacksmith shop. C.W. Potter opened the first merchandising house in the village in 1845.

The village, consisting of but four houses, had a negative existence until the Pennsylvania Coal Company, in 1847–1848, turned it into a growing and diverse town.

By 1875, the township of Providence was dissolved and the land split up into various smaller boroughs and towns with Dunmore being one of them. Today, Dunmore is a borough bordering the city of Scranton.

The name Dunmore comes from Dunmore Park, in the Falkirk area of Scotland (home of the Dunmore Pineapple).

Golo Footwear had its original manufacturing and design facilities in Dunmore until 1957.

Most of the borough is drained by Roaring Brook, except for an area in the west drained by Meadow Brook into the Lackawanna River. The southeastern side of the borough is on the slopes of the Moosic Mountains, which the gorge cuts through.

The Lackawanna Railroad operated through the Nay Aug Gorge into Scranton from the Poconos and Northern New Jersey.

The Keystone Industrial Park is also located in Dunmore.

==Environmental issues==
Keystone Sanitary Landfill, the largest landfill in the state of Pennsylvania has been located in Dunmore since 1973, about 450 feet from the Dunmore Reservoir #1, a backup drinking water supply. In 1987, it extended to Throop, Pennsylvania. The landfill was built over mines known for ground subsidence. As of 2015 the landfill accepts over 7,200 tons of trash per day. More than a third of its in-state waste since 2009 is from fracking drill cuttings, drilling mud and fluids. Cuttings are mixed with small amounts of naturally occurring radioactive elements, particularly radium-226. The landfill has been leaking into ground water per its Phase 3 permit application. Run-off is discharged into Eddy&#x27;s Creek and the Lackawanna River.

In November 2014, the Dunmore borough council approved a $15.63 million agreement for Keystone as a basis for an extension, and a definition of the landfill as a “pre-existing landfill” to ensure Keystone a more favorable interpretation of the borough&#x27;s zoning ordinance against public opinion.

On September 20, 2018, Pennsylvania DEP issued a Notice of Violation to Keystone for storing leachate in excess of 25% of its total leachate storage capacity on a regular basis since October 2016.

<text>Jermyn, known as &quot;The Birthplace of First Aid in America&quot;, is a borough which is located in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, United States. Located on the Lackawanna River, it is northeast of Scranton.

In 1900, the population was 2,567, much of it attracted by the prospects of finding work at a large anthracite coal site in the region. Coal mines, cut glass works, silk, powder, grist, planing, sawmills, bottling works, and fertilizer factories dotted the borough during the early years of the twentieth century.

By the time of the 2020 census, the population had declined to 2,156.

Jermyn is presently the mailing address of the Lakeland School District. East Jermyn, the section of town east of the Lackawanna River and west of the small section of Archbald known as &quot;Nebraska&quot;, is commonly referred to as &quot;The Lane&quot;.

==History==

The borough originally named Gibsonburg, was named for John Jermyn, a businessperson in the mining industry.

Jermyn is known as &quot;The Birthplace of First Aid in America.&quot; In 1899, Dr. Matthew J. Shields conducted the nation&#x27;s first training class on First Aid at the Windsor Hotel. He instructed 25 miners from the Jermyn Coal Colliery how to provide quick, effective medical care until a physician could reach the mine. After completion of the course, each of the miners was able to provide first aid to injured comrades—leading to dramatic reductions in serious mining injuries and fatalities. Unfortunately for numerous coal miners, a &quot;silent killer&quot; called black lung disease was caused by inhaling coal dust over time and this resulted in the untimely deaths of many former miners.

Jermyn was incorporated as a borough in 1870 and celebrated its centennial in 1970 throughout the year, with a week-long celebration in July. A carnival and a massive fireworks display was held in East Jermyn at the St Michaels Russian Orthodox Hall grounds. Makeshift jails were built throughout the town and located at several street intersections to accommodate persons that were inebriated from too much alcohol. &quot;Drunk Tanks&quot; if you will.

==Education==
It is in the Mid Valley School District.

While the anthracite coal industry was thriving, there were numerous neighborhood schools: the Columbus School in the Smoketown section, the Washington School and the Roosevelt School in the Fern Hill section, the Lincoln School in the Grassy Island Heights section, as well as a three-room school in the Underwood Village and a one-room school in Marshwood. There was a Central School for elementary school students who lived downtown and in the Flats section. The annex of the Central School was Olyphant Senior High School. Olyphant Junior High School was in a separate building.

As the population declined, the neighborhood schools were closed and demolished. In 1969, the Olyphant, Dickson City, and Throop school districts consolidated to form the Mid Valley School District. The Olyphant Junior High School became the Mid-Valley Senior High School. The annex of the Olyphant Elementary School had elementary school grades as well as some overflow classes from the senior high school. On February 10, 1977, the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry condemned the Olyphant Elementary School and the annex. The displaced elementary school students were moved to the Mid-Valley Junior High School in Dickson City. The displaced junior high school students and the senior high school students attended classes in the senior high school on split sessions. Eventually, new schools were built. Currently, the Mid-Valley School District has a single elementary school, and a single secondary school on Underwood Road in Throop.

Up until the mid-1970s, each Catholic parish (of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Scranton) had a parochial school: St. Patrick&#x27;s, St. Michael&#x27;s, and Holy Ghost. Saints Cyril and Methodius Ukrainian Catholic School remained open longer, but it was eventually closed.

There are private Catholic schools in neighboring municipalities. The La Salle Academy Primary Campus in Dickson City is for students in Pre-Kindergarten through Grade 3; the Main Campus in Jessup is for students in Grades 4 through 8. High school students can attend Bishop O&#x27;Hara High School in Dunmore and Scranton Preparatory School in Scranton.

<text>Lionel Groulx (; 13 January 1878 – 23 May 1967) was a Canadian Roman Catholic priest, historian, professor, public intellectual and Quebec nationalist.

== Biography ==

===Early life and ordination===

Lionel Groulx, né Joseph Adolphe Lyonel Groulx, was the son of Léon Groulx (1837–1878), a farmer, a lumberjack and direct descendant of New France pioneer Jean Grou, and Philomène Salomé Pilon (1849–1943). Groulx was born and died at Vaudreuil, Quebec. After his seminary training and studies in Europe, he taught at Valleyfield College in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, and then the Université de Montréal. In 1917 he co-founded a monthly journal called &quot;Action Française&quot;, becoming its editor in 1920.

He was ordained to the priesthood on 28 June 1903.

===Study of Confederation===
Groulx was one of the first Quebec historians to study Confederation: he insisted on its recognition of Quebec rights and minority rights, although he believed a combination of corrupt political parties and French Canadian minority status in the Dominion had failed to deliver on those promises, as the Manitoba conflict exposed. Groulx believed that only through national education and the Quebec government could the economic and social inferiority of French Canadians be repaired. Groulx was quite successful promoting his brand of ultramontanism.

His main focus was to restore Quebeckers&#x27; pride in their identity by knowledge of history, both the heroic acts of New France and the French Canadian and self-government rights obtained through a succession of important political victories: 1774, the Quebec Act recognized the rights of the Quebec province and its people with respect to French law, Catholic religion and the French language; in 1848, responsible government was finally obtained after decades of struggle, along with the rights of the French language; in 1867, the autonomy of the province of Quebec was restored as Lower Canada was an essential partner in the creation of a new dominion through confederation. 
Lionel Groulx called the Canadian Confederation of 1867 a failure and espoused the theory that French Canada&#x27;s only hope for survival was to bolster a French State and a Roman Catholic Quebec as the means to emancipate the nation and a bulwark against English power. He believed the powers of the provincial government of Quebec could and should be used, within Confederation, to better the lot of the French Canadian nation, economically, socially, culturally and linguistically. 
His curriculum and writings de-emphasized or ignored conflicts between the clergy and those who were struggling for democratic rights, and de-emphasized any conflicts between the &quot;habitants&quot; or peasant class and the French-Canadian elites. He preferred the settled habitants to the more adventurous and, in his view, licentious coureurs des bois. His work, under the pseudonym Lionel Montal, was part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1924 Summer Olympics.

In 1928, the Université de Montréal insisted that Groulx sign a paper saying that he would respect Confederation and English-Canadian sensibilities as a condition of receiving a respectable salary for his teaching work. He would not sign, but finally agreed to a condition that he would limit himself to historical studies; he resigned from the editorship of &quot;L&#x27;action canadienne-française&quot; soon after, and the magazine ceased publication at the end of the year.

Lionel Groulx&#x27;s major writings include the novel &quot;L&#x27;Appel de la race&quot; (1922); &quot;Histoire de la Confédération&quot;; &quot;Notre grande aventure&quot; (1958); &quot;Histoire du Canada français&quot; (1951), and &quot;Notre maître le passé&quot;.

===Writings on New France===
In order to inculcate pride in a nation he considered degraded by Conquest, Groulx engaged in national myth-making, celebrating the days of New France as a golden age and elevating Dollard des Ormeaux into a legendary hero. He has been described as the first French Canadian historian to consider the period of French colonial rule superior to that of the British control that followed it, evaluating the conquest of New France as a disaster rather than the common 19th-century Canadian view of it as a &#x27;blessing&#x27; that saved Quebec from the atheist terrors of the French Revolution.

He also developed a Quebec history curriculum that glorified French colonization in Canada, the difficulties imposed upon the &quot;Canadiens&quot; by the conquest of New France, and how these were countered by lengthy political struggles for democratic rights. He insisted, as had many before him, on the Quebec Act of 1774 as the official recognition of his nation&#x27;s rights. He bore particular affection for the undertaking of Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, that in 1849 successfully restored the rights of the French language along with the obtention of responsible government, thus thwarting the assimilation plans of Lord Durham&#x27;s policy of a union between the colonies of Upper and Lower Canada.

He received the Royal Society of Canada&#x27;s J. B. Tyrrell Historical Medal in 1948.

===Ligue d&#x27;action française===

At the Ligue d&#x27;Action française, Groulx and his colleagues hoped to inspire revival of the French language and French Canadian culture, but also to create a think tank and public space of reflection, so that the French Canadian nation&#x27;s elites would find ways to remedy French Canada&#x27;s underdevelopment and exclusion from big business.

Some collaborators of the review thus actively participated in the development of the HEC business school. Others were actively involved in the promotion of the Church&#x27;s Social doctrine, an official Catholic answer to socio-economic distress that was meant to prevent the appeal of socialism and improve capitalism.

Groulx&#x27;s conservative Catholicism was not very appreciative of other religions, although he also acknowledged that racism was not Christian, and he maintained that Quebec should aspire to be a model society by Christian standards, including intense missionary action. [Le Canada français missionnaire, Montreal, Fides, 1962].

===Catholic social teaching===
This Catholic social doctrine later became part of the 1930s Action liberale nationale (ALN) party, a new party that intellectuals close to Groulx and the defunct Action française appreciated. When Maurice Duplessis&#x27;s victory became apparent, some instead accepted to cooperate with his government and its reforms. But Groulx, and with him a large number of intellectuals, chose to oppose him.

During the Second World War Groulx, like many Canadien nationalists, spoke in favour of the Vichy regime of Philippe Pétain, although public statements to this effect remained rare.

Groulx and other intellectuals settled into a partial alliance with Liberal Party of Quebec leader Adelard Godbout, who served as Premier from 1939 to 1944. They soon broke with him on account of his submission to the federal Liberals. Yet in 1944 they opposed Duplessis again, this time placing their hopes in another new party, the Bloc populaire Canadien, led by André Laurendeau. Future Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau was part of this young party, which soon suffered the same fate as the previous third party, the ALN. After the 1948 election, the Bloc populaire Canadien disappeared.

===Economic protectionism===
Groulx was later remembered both for his strong case in favour of economic reconquest of Quebec by French Canadians, defense of the French language, and pioneer work as the first chair of Canadian history in Quebec (Université de Montréal; see Ronald Rudin, &quot;Making History in Twentieth Century Quebec&quot;, University of Toronto Press, 1997. ). Rudin underscores Groulx&#x27;s founding role in scholarly History with the development of the Montréal History Department. Groulx founded the &quot;Institut d&#x27;histoire d&#x27;Amérique française&quot; in 1946, an institute located in Montreal devoted to the historical study of Quebec and of the French presence in the Americas and the publication of &quot;La revue d&#x27;histoire de l&#x27;Amérique française&quot;, still today arguably the main publication for professional historians in Quebec. His main intellectual contribution was to create a rapprochement between nationalism and the Catholic religion, blunting the hostility between nationalists and the Church that had existed in the nineteenth century.

===Later influence===
Through his writings and teaching at the university and his association with the intellectual elite of Quebec, he had a profound influence on many people (such as Michel Chartrand and Camille Laurin). However, many of the young intellectuals he influenced often did not share his conservative ideology (such as his successor at the University of Montreal). Groulx&#x27;s traditionalist, religious form of Québécois nationalism, known as clerico-nationalism, influenced Quebec society into the 1950s.

Collège Lionel-Groulx, Lionel Groulx Avenue and the Lionel Groulx metro station are named in his honour.

In June 2020, in the wake of global anti-racism and anti-police brutality protests, a petition was launched by Montréalers asking the city government to rename the Lionel-Groulx métro station after the African-Canadian jazz pianist Oscar Peterson. Peterson grew up in the Little Burgundy area of Montreal where the station is located. A counter petition also circulated, asking Montreal to retain the name, claiming that deleting Groulx&#x27;s name from the station would be “a consent to amnesia and a reshaping of our past.” The City kept the status quo, asserting that a moratorium on changing station names had been in place since 2006.

==Anti-Semitism==
Accusations of anti-Semitism were made by Canadian author Mordecai Richler and French-Canadian historian Esther Delisle in the 1990s against several pre-World War II Quebec intellectuals, including Groulx.

In 1933, writing under the pseudonym Jacques Brassier in the article &quot;So That We May Live...&quot; [&quot;Pour qu&#x27;on vive...&quot;&quot;], published in the journal &quot;L&#x27;Action nationale&quot; [&quot;National Action&quot;], Groulx states his opposition to anti-Semitism. In the section &quot;The Jewish Problem&quot; [&quot;Le problème juif&quot;], he states, &quot;Antisemitism is not only not a Christian solution [to the Jewish problem], it is a solution that is negative and ridiculous.&quot; [&quot;L&#x27;antisémitisme, non seulement n&#x27;est pas une solution chrétienne; c&#x27;est une solution négative et niaise&quot;] (trans. Robinson 101). Apologists for Groulx have cited that quotation. However, the following sentence of the article has Groulx go on to give his unequivocal support to the boycott of Jewish businesses in Quebec: &quot;To resolve the Jewish problem, it would suffice if French Canadians regained their common sense. There is no need of extraordinary legislation; no need for violence of any sort. We will only give our people the order, &#x27;Do not buy from the Jews&#x27;... And if by some miracle our order were understood and complied with, then in six months the Jewish problem would be solved, not merely in Montréal but from one end of the province to the other&quot; (trans. Robinson 101-102). Thus, put into context, although he stops short of advocating the legislation of outright anti-Semitic policies and supporting violence against Jews, Groulx supported systemic anti-Semitism by giving French Canadians the &quot;order&quot; to boycott Jewish businesses to solve the &quot;Jewish problem&quot; in Quebec.

Citing Groulx&#x27;s assertion that anti-Semitism is &quot;negative and ridiculous,&quot; some scholars have downplayed allegations of anti-Semitism against Groulx. In a speech given in 1999, the historian Xavier Gélinas argues that Groulx did not support &quot;racial anti-Semitism,&quot; which &quot;confronts Jews for being Jews.&quot; While acknowledging the problematic and anti-Semitic nature of Groulx&#x27;s rhetoric, Gélinas claims that it represents &quot;cultural anti-Semitism&quot; that singles out Jews because of the &quot;principles and customs that they are deemed, rightly or wrongly, to believe in and to practice&quot; and are &quot;opposed to the traditional nationalist vision of Quebec.&quot;

<doc id="132858" wikidata="Q705707" url="?curid=132858" title="Art Ross Trophy">
<text>The Art Ross Trophy is awarded to the National Hockey League (NHL) player who leads the league in points at the end of the regular season. It was presented to the league by former player, general manager, and head coach Art Ross. The trophy has been awarded 70 times to 29 players since its introduction in the 1947–48 NHL season. Ross is also known for his design of the official NHL puck, with slightly bevelled edges for better control.

The current holder is Nikita Kucherov of the Tampa Bay Lightning.

==History==

The Art Ross Trophy was presented to the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1947 by Arthur Howey &quot;Art&quot; Ross, former general manager and head coach of the Boston Bruins and Hockey Hall of Fame inductee as a player. Elmer Lach of the Montreal Canadiens was awarded the first Art Ross Trophy at the conclusion of the season.

Players from the Pittsburgh Penguins won the trophy 15 times and the Edmonton Oilers have won the trophy 13 times, while the Montreal Canadiens and Chicago Blackhawks are tied for third with nine times each. Although Joe Thornton, winner from the season, started the season playing for the Boston Bruins, he finished with the San Jose Sharks and the award counts for the Sharks. Therefore, Boston Bruins have seven players winning the trophy, fifth overall.

From 1951 to 2001, Jean Beliveau, Marcel Dionne, and Bryan Trottier were the only &quot;single-time&quot; winners of the scoring title, while Gordie Howe, Bernie Geoffrion, Dickie Moore, Bobby Hull, Stan Mikita, Phil Esposito, Bobby Orr, Guy Lafleur, Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, and Jaromir Jagr all won it on multiple occasions. For two decades, from 1981 to 2001, only three players won the Art Ross Trophy: Gretzky, Lemieux, and Jagr. The streak ended when Jarome Iginla won the trophy in 2002.

Gretzky has won the trophy a record ten times, seven consecutively, during his 20-year NHL career. Gordie Howe and Lemieux have each won it six times, while Esposito, Jagr and McDavid each have five. Jagr, from the Czech Republic, has won the award the most times as a non-Canadian. Patrick Kane is the only American-born player to win the trophy, doing so in 2016. Gretzky is the only player to win the trophy for more than one team, while Thornton is the only player to win it while playing for two different teams in one season. Stan Mikita is the only player in NHL history to win the Art Ross, Hart, and Lady Byng Trophies all in the same season, which he did twice ( and , with Chicago; Gretzky, Bobby Hull, and Martin St. Louis all won each of those awards at least once and won a combination of two of them in the same season, but never all three together). Orr is the only defenseman to win the scoring title, doing so in 1970 and 1975 with Boston, and in 1970 he became the first player to capture four individual awards in a single season as he won the Hart, Norris, and Conn Smythe Trophies that year as well.

In 2007, Sidney Crosby became the youngest player to win the Art Ross Trophy at age 19, and also became the youngest scoring champion in any major North American professional sport. At almost twice Crosby&#x27;s age, Martin St. Louis became the oldest player to capture the Art Ross at the age of 37, also having the longest gap between scoring titles (nine years). Henrik and Daniel Sedin are the only siblings to win the award, in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Since 2001, only five players, Connor McDavid, Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, St. Louis and Nikita Kucherov have won the award more than once: Crosby in 2007 and 2014, Malkin in 2009 and 2012, St. Louis in 2004 and 2013, McDavid in 2017, 2018, 2021, 2022 and 2023 and Kucherov in 2019 and 2024. McDavid and Gretzky are the only players to win multiple Art Ross trophies before age 21.

The NHL rules stipulate three tiebreakers in case two or more players are tied in points:
#Player with most goals
#Player with fewer games played
#Player scoring first goal of the season

Scoring ties happened in the , , and seasons, all of them being decided by the first tiebreaker of scoring more goals. In those respective seasons, Hull won over Andy Bathgate, Dionne over Gretzky, and Jagr over Eric Lindros. The NHL&#x27;s award to recognize the leading goal-scorer, the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy, does not have a tiebreaker, allowing multiple winners to be recognized in any one season.

<text>Scranton is a city in and the county seat of Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, United States. With a population of 76,328 as of the 2020 U.S. census, Scranton is the most populous city in Northeastern Pennsylvania and the Wyoming Valley metropolitan area, which has a population of 562,037 as of 2020. It is the sixth-most populous city in Pennsylvania. 

The contiguous network of five cities and more than 40 boroughs all built in a straight line in Northeastern Pennsylvania&#x27;s urban core act culturally and logistically as one continuous city, so while Scranton is a mid-sized city, the larger Scranton/Wilkes-Barre metropolitan area contains half a million residents in roughly 300 square miles (780 km2). Scranton is the cultural and economic center of Northeastern Pennsylvania, a region of the state with over 1.3 million residents. 

Scranton hosts a federal court building for the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The city is conventionally divided into nine districts: North Scranton, Southside, Westside, Eastside/Hill Section, Central City, Minooka, West Mountain, East Mountain, and Green Ridge, though these areas do not have legal status. The city is the geographic and cultural center of the Lackawanna River valley and Northeastern Pennsylvania, as well as the largest of the former anthracite coal mining communities in a contiguous quilt-work that also includes Wilkes-Barre, Nanticoke, Pittston, and Carbondale. 

Scranton was incorporated on February 14, 1856, as a borough in Luzerne County and as a city on April 23, 1866. It became a major industrial city and a center of mining and railroads; it attracted thousands of new immigrants. It was the site of the Scranton general strike in 1877. The city was designated as the county seat when Lackawanna County was established in 1878, and a judicial district was authorized in July 1879.

The city&#x27;s nickname &quot;Electric City&quot; began when electric lights were introduced in 1880 at the Dickson Manufacturing Company. Six years later, the United States&#x27; first streetcars powered only by electricity began operating in the city. Rev. David Spencer, a local Baptist minister, later proclaimed Scranton as the &quot;Electric City&quot;.

The city&#x27;s industrial production and population peaked during the 1930s and 1940s, caused by demand for coal and textiles, especially during World War II. But while the national economy boomed after the war, demand for the region&#x27;s coal declined as other forms of energy became more popular, which also harmed the rail industry. Foreseeing the decline, city leaders formulated the Scranton Plan in 1945 to diversify the local economy beyond coal, but the city&#x27;s economy continued to decline. The Knox Mine disaster of 1959 essentially ended coal mining in the region. Scranton&#x27;s population dropped by over 67,000, from its peak of 143,433 in the 1930 census, to 76,089 in the 2010 census, but had rebounded slightly by 2020. The city now has large health care, academic, tourism, railroad, and manufacturing sectors.

Scranton is located north of Allentown, north-northwest of Philadelphia, and west-northwest of New York City.

==History==
===18th century===

In 1778, during the colonial era, Isaac Tripp, the area&#x27;s first known white settler, built his home here; it still stands in North Scranton, formerly a separate town known as Providence. More settlers from Connecticut Colony came to the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries following the end of the American Revolutionary War, since their state claimed the area as part of their colonial charter.

They gradually established mills and other small businesses in a village that became known as Slocum Hollow. People in the village during this time carried the traits and accent of their New England settlers, which were somewhat different from most of Pennsylvania. Some area settlers from Connecticut participated in what was known as the Pennamite Wars, where settlers competed for control of the territory which had been included in royal colonial land grants to both states. The claim between Connecticut and Pennsylvania was settled by negotiation with the federal government&#x27;s involvement after the Revolutionary War.

===19th century===

Though anthracite coal was being mined in Carbondale to the north and Wilkes-Barre to the south, the industries that precipitated the city&#x27;s early rapid growth were iron and steel. In the 1840s, brothers Selden T. and George W. Scranton, who had worked at Oxford Furnace in Oxford, New Jersey, founded what became Lackawanna Iron &amp; Coal, later developing as the Lackawanna Steel Company. It initially started producing iron nails, but that venture failed due to low-quality iron. The Erie Railroad&#x27;s construction in New York State was delayed by its having to acquire iron rails as imports from England. The Scrantons&#x27; firm decided to switch its focus to producing T-rails for the Erie; the company soon became a major producer of rails for the rapidly expanding railroads.

In 1851, the Scrantons built the Lackawanna and Western Railroad (L&amp;W) northward, with recent Irish immigrants supplying most of the labor, to meet the Erie Railroad in Great Bend, Pennsylvania. Thus they could transport manufactured rails from the Lackawanna Valley to New York and the Midwest. They also invested in coal mining operations in the city to fuel their steel operations, and to market it to businesses. In 1856, they expanded the railroad eastward as the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&amp;W), to tap into the New York City metropolitan market. This railroad, with its hub in Scranton, was Scranton&#x27;s largest employer for almost one hundred years.

The Pennsylvania Coal Company built a gravity railroad in the 1850s through the city for the purpose of transporting coal. The gravity railroad was replaced by a steam railroad built in 1886 by the Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad (later absorbed by the Erie Railroad). The Delaware and Hudson (D&amp;H) Canal Company, which had its own gravity railroad from Carbondale to Honesdale, built a steam railroad that entered Scranton in 1863.

During this short period of time, the city rapidly transformed from a small, agrarian-based village of people with New England roots to a multicultural, industrial-based city. From 1860 to 1900, the city&#x27;s population increased more than tenfold. Most new immigrants, such as the Irish, Italians, and south Germans and Polish, were Catholic, a contrast to the majority-Protestant early settlers of colonial descent. National, ethnic, religious and class differences were wrapped into political affiliations, with many new immigrants joining the Democratic Party, and, for a time in the late 1870s, the Greenbacker-Labor Party.

In 1856, the borough of Scranton was officially incorporated. It was incorporated as a city of 35,000 in 1866 in Luzerne County, when the surrounding boroughs of Hyde Park (now part of the city&#x27;s West Side) and Providence (now part of North Scranton) were merged with Scranton. Twelve years later in 1878, the state passed a law enabling creation of new counties where a county&#x27;s population surpassed 150,000, as did Luzerne&#x27;s. The law appeared to enable the creation of Lackawanna County, and there was considerable political agitation around the authorizing process. Scranton was designated by the state legislature as the county seat of the newly formed county, which was also established as a separate judicial district, with state judges moving over from Luzerne County after courts were organized in October 1878. This was the last county in the state to be organized.

Creation of the new county, which enabled both more local control and political patronage, helped begin the Scranton General Strike of 1877. This was in part due to the larger Great Railroad Strike, in which railroad workers began to organize and participate in walkouts after wage cuts in Martinsburg, West Virginia. The national economy had lagged since the Panic of 1873, and workers in many industries struggled with low wages and intermittent work. In Scranton, mineworkers followed the railroad men off the job, as did others. A protest of 5,000 strikers ended in violence, with a total of four men killed, and 20 to 50 injured, including the mayor. He had established a militia, but called for help from the governor and state militia. Governor John Hartranft eventually brought in federal troops to quell the strike. The workers gained nothing in wages, but began to organize more purposefully into labor unions that could wield more power.

The nation&#x27;s first successful, continuously operating electrified streetcar (trolley) system was established in the city in 1886, inspiring the nickname &quot;The Electric City&quot;. In 1896, the city&#x27;s various streetcar companies were consolidated into the Scranton Railway Company, which ran trolleys until 1954. By 1890, three other railroads had built lines to tap into the rich supply of coal in and around the city, including the Erie Railroad, the Central Railroad of New Jersey and finally the New York, Ontario and Western Railway (NYO&amp;W).

As the vast rail network spread above ground, an even larger network of railways served the rapidly expanding system of coal veins underground. Miners, who in the early years were typically Welsh and Irish, were hired as cheaply as possible by the coal barons. The workers endured low pay, long hours and unsafe working conditions. Children as young as eight or nine worked 14-hour days separating slate from coal in the breakers. Often, the workers were forced to use company-provided housing and purchase food and other goods from stores owned by the coal companies. With hundreds of thousands of immigrants arriving in the industrial cities, mine owners did not have to search for labor and workers struggled to keep their positions. Later miners came from Italy and eastern Europe, which people fled because of poverty and lack of jobs.

Business was booming at the end of the 19th century. The tonnage of coal mined increased virtually every year, as did the steel manufactured by the Lackawanna Steel Company. At one point the company had the largest steel plant in the United States, and it was still the second largest producer at the turn of the 20th century. By 1900, the city had a population of more than 100,000.

In the late 1890s, Scranton was home to a series of early International League baseball teams.

Scranton has had a notable labor history; various coal worker unions struggled throughout the coal-mining era to improve working conditions, raise wages, and guarantee fair treatment for workers. The Panic of 1873 and other economic difficulties caused a national recession and loss of business. As the economy contracted, the railroad companies reduced wages of workers in most classes (while sometimes reserving raises for their top management). A major strike of railroad workers in August 1877, part of the Great Railroad Strike, attracted workers from the steel industry and mining as well, and developed as the Scranton General Strike. Four rioters were killed during unrest during the strike, after the mayor mustered a militia. With violence suppressed by militia and federal troops, workers finally returned to their jobs, not able to gain any economic relief. William Walker Scranton, from the prominent family, was then general manager of Lackawanna Iron and Coal. He later founded Scranton Steel Company.

The labor issues and growth of industry in Scranton contributed to Lackawanna County being established by the state legislature in 1878, with territory taken from Luzerne County. Scranton was designated as the county seat. This strengthened its local government.

The unions failed to gain higher wages that year, but in 1878 they elected labor leader Terence V. Powderly of the Knights of Labor as mayor of Scranton. After that, he became national leader of the KoL, a predominately Catholic organization that had a peak membership of 700,000 circa 1880. While the Catholic Church had prohibited membership in secret organizations since the mid-18th century, by the late 1880s with the influence of Archbishop James Gibbons of Baltimore, Maryland, it supported the Knights of Labor as representing workingmen and union organizing.

===20th century===


The landmark Coal strike of 1902 was called by anthracite miners across the region and led by the United Mine Workers under John Mitchell. The strike was settled by a compromise brokered by President Theodore Roosevelt. A statue of John Mitchell was installed in his honor on the grounds of the Lackawanna County Courthouse in Scranton, &quot;the site of the Coal Strike of 1902 negotiations in which President Roosevelt participated. Because of the significance of these negotiations, the statue and the Courthouse were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. John Mitchell is buried in Cathedral Cemetery in Scranton.&quot;

At the 1900 United States census, the population of Scranton was about 102,026, making it the third-largest city in Pennsylvania and 38th-largest U.S. city at the time.
At the turn of the 20th century, wealthy businessmen and industrialists built impressive Victorian mansions in the Hill and Green Ridge sections of the city. The industrial workers, who tended to be later immigrants from Ireland and southern and eastern Europe, were predominately Catholic. With a flood of immigrants in the market, they suffered poor working conditions and wages.

In 1902, the dwindling local iron ore supply, labor issues, and an aging plant cost the city the industry on which it was founded. The Lackawanna Steel Company and many of its workers were moved to Lackawanna, New York, developed on Lake Erie just south of Buffalo. With a port on the lake, the company could receive iron ore shipped from the Mesabi Range in Minnesota, which was being newly mined.

Scranton forged ahead as the capital of the anthracite coal industry. Attracting the thousands of workers needed to mine coal, the city developed new neighborhoods dominated by Italian and Eastern European immigrants, who brought their foods, cultures and religions. Many of the immigrants joined the Democratic Party. Their national churches and neighborhoods were part of the history of the city. Several Catholic and Orthodox churches were founded and built during this period. A substantial Jewish community was also established, with most members coming from the Russian Empire and eastern Europe. Working conditions for miners were improved by the efforts of labor leaders such as John Mitchell, who led the United Mine Workers.

The sub-surface mining weakened whole neighborhoods, however, damaging homes, schools, and businesses when the land collapsed. In 1913 the state passed the Davis Act to establish the Bureau of Surface Support in Scranton. Because of the difficulty in dealing with the coal companies, citizens organized the Scranton Surface Protection Association, chartered by the Court of Common Pleas on November 24, 1913 &quot;to protect the lives and property of the citizens of the City of Scranton and the streets of said city from injury, loss and damage caused by mining and mine caves.&quot;

In 1915 and 1917, the city and Commonwealth sought injunctions to prevent coal companies from undermining city streets but lost their cases. North Main Avenue and Boulevard Avenue, &quot;both entitled to surface support, caved in as a result&quot; of court decisions that went against civil authorities and allowed the coal companies to continue their operations.

&quot;The case of &quot;Penman v. Jones&quot; came out differently. The Lackawanna Iron &amp; Coal Co. had leased coal lands to the Lackawanna Iron &amp; Steel Co., an allied interest, which passed the leases on to the Scranton Coal Co. Areas of central Scranton, the Hill Section, South Side, Pine Brook, Green Ridge and Hyde Park were affected by their mining activities. Mr. Penman was the private property owner in the case. The coal operators were defeated in this case.&quot;

The public transportation system began to expand beyond the trolley lines pioneered by predecessors of the Scranton Railways system. The Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad, commonly referred to as the Laurel Line, was built as an interurban passenger and freight carrier to Wilkes-Barre. Its Scranton station, offices, powerhouse and maintenance facility were built on the former grounds of the Lackawanna Steel Company, and operations started in 1903. Beginning in 1907, Scrantonians could also ride trolley cars to the northern suburbs of Clarks Summit and Dalton. They could travel to Lake Winola and Montrose using the Northern Electric Railroad. After the 1920s, no new trolley lines were built, but bus operations were started and expanded to meet service needs. In 1934, Scranton Railways was re-incorporated as the Scranton Transit Company, reflecting that shift in transportation modes.

Starting in the early 1920s, the Scranton Button Company (founded in 1885 and a major maker of shellac buttons) became one of the primary makers of phonograph records. They pressed records for Emerson (whom they bought in 1924), as well as Regal, Cameo, Romeo, Banner, Domino, Conqueror. In July 1929, the company merged with Regal, Cameo, Banner, and the U.S. branch of Pathé (makers of Pathé and Perfect) to become the American Record Corporation. By 1938, the Scranton company was also pressing records for Brunswick, Melotone, and Vocalion. In 1946, the company was acquired by Capitol Records, which continued to produce phonograph records through the end of the vinyl era.

By the mid-1930s, the city population had swelled beyond 140,000 due to growth in the mining and silk textile industries. World War II created a great demand for energy, which led to the highest production from mining in the area since World War I.

After World War II, coal lost favor to oil and natural gas as a heating fuel, largely because the latter types were more convenient to use. While some U.S. cities prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes and population of Scranton (and the rest of Lackawanna and Luzerne counties) began to diminish. Coal production and rail traffic declined rapidly throughout the 1950s, causing a loss of jobs.

In 1954, Worthington Scranton and his wife, Marion Margery Scranton, contributed one million dollars to establish the Scranton Foundation (now the Scranton Area Community Foundation), which was launched to support charitable and educational organizations in the city of Scranton.

The Knox Mine Disaster of January 1959 virtually ended the mining industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The waters of the Susquehanna River flooded the mines. The DL&amp;W Railroad, nearly bankrupted by the drop in coal traffic and the effects of Hurricane Diane, merged in 1960 with the Erie Railroad.
Demand for public transportation also declined as new highways were built by federal subsidies and people purchased automobiles. In 1952, the Laurel Line ceased passenger service. The Scranton Transit Company, whose trolleys had given the city its nickname, transferred all operations to buses as the 1954 holiday season approached; by the end of 1971, it ceased all operations. The city was left without any public transportation system for almost a year until the Lackawanna County government formed COLTS, which began operations in late 1972 with 1950s-era GM busses from New Jersey.

Scranton had been the hub of its operations until the Erie Lackawanna merger, after which it no longer served in this capacity. This was another severe blow to the local labor market. The NYO&amp;W Railroad, which depended heavily on its Scranton branch for freight traffic, was abandoned in 1957. Mine subsidence was a spreading problem in the city as pillar supports in abandoned mines began to fail; cave-ins sometimes consumed entire blocks of homes. The area was left scarred by abandoned coal mining structures, strip mines, and massive culm dumps, some of which caught fire and burned for many years until they were extinguished through government efforts. In 1970, the Secretary of Mines for Pennsylvania suggested that so many underground voids had been left by mining underneath Scranton that it would be &quot;more economical&quot; to abandon the city than make them safe. In 1973, the last mine operations in Lackawanna County (which were in what is now McDade Park, and another on the Scranton/Dickson City line) were closed. During the 1960s and 1970s, the silk and other textile industries shrank as jobs were moved to the South or overseas.

In 1962, businessman Alex Grass opened his first &quot;Thrif D Discount Center&quot; drugstore on Lackawanna Avenue in downtown Scranton. The store, an immediate success, was the progenitor of the Rite Aid national drugstore chain.

During the 1970s and 1980s, many downtown storefronts and theaters became vacant. Suburban development followed the highways and suburban shopping malls became the dominant venues for shopping and entertainment.
Since the mid-1980s, the city has emphasized revitalization. Local government and much of the community at large have adopted a renewed interest in the city&#x27;s buildings and history. Some historic properties have been renovated and marketed as tourist attractions. The Steamtown National Historic Site captures the area&#x27;s once-prominent position in the railroad industry. The former DL&amp;W train station was restored as the Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel. The Electric City Trolley Museum was created next to the DL&amp;W yards that the Steamtown NHS occupies.

Since the mid-1980s the Scranton Cultural Center has operated the architecturally significant Masonic Temple and Scottish Rite Cathedral, designed by Raymond Hood, as the region&#x27;s performing arts center. The Houdini Museum was opened in Scranton in 1990 by nationally known magician Dorothy Dietrich.

===21st century===
According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the city was close to bankruptcy in July 2012, with the wages of all municipal officials, including the mayor and fire chief, being cut to $7.25/hour. Financial consultant Gary Lewis, who lived in Scranton, was quoted as estimating that &quot;on 5 July the city had just $5,000 cash in hand.&quot;

Since the revitalization began, many coffee shops, restaurants, and bars have opened in the downtown. The low cost of living, pedestrian-friendly downtown, and the construction of loft-style apartments in older, architecturally significant buildings have attracted young professionals and artists. Many are individuals who grew up in Scranton, moved to big cities after high school and college, and decided to return to the area. Many buildings around the city that were once empty are currently being restored. Some of the newly renovated buildings are already being used.

Attractions include the Montage Mountain Ski Resort, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, AHL affiliate of the Pittsburgh Penguins; the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders, AAA affiliate of the New York Yankees, PNC Field, and the Toyota Pavilion at Montage Mountain concert venue.

On September 22, 2024, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, which produces 155mm artillery shells that Ukraine&#x27;s military uses.

===Public and private buses===

Scranton&#x27;s provider of public transportation is the County of Lackawanna Transit System (COLTS). COLTS buses provide extensive service within the city and more limited service that reaches in all directions to Carbondale, Daleville, Pittston, and Fleetville. The other bussing company is the Luzerne County Transportation Authority (LCTA), which mainly runs through The Minooka section (closest to Luzerne County) and Downtown Scranton by The Marketplace at Steamtown. LCTA takes passengers from Scranton to the Mohegan Pennsylvania racino in Plains

Martz Trailways and Greyhound Lines provide coach bus transportation from its downtown station to New York City, Philadelphia, and other Northeastern destinations.

Several jitney companies operate from Scranton through Stroudsburg to Paterson and New York City via I-80.

===Railroads===
Rail transportation, in both freight and passenger, were vital to the city&#x27;s historic growth. The city was a hub, serving the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ), the Delaware and Hudson Railway, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DLW), the Erie Railroad, and the Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad (LWV), with routes radiating in all directions, to New York state&#x27;s Southern Tier, to several points in Pennsylvania, and to parts of North Jersey. The CNJ station and the DLW station were the last to lose passenger service, in the early 1950s and in 1970, respectively.

Freight rail remains important in Scranton. The Norfolk Southern Railway runs freight trains on the former Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western (DL&amp;W) line between Scranton and Binghamton, New York, having taken over operations from the Canadian Pacific Railway (Delaware and Hudson Railway division) in 2015. The Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad serves the former DL&amp;W Keyser Valley branch in the city.

The Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad, as designated operator of county-owned rail lines, oversees the former Delaware and Hudson line from Scranton north to Carbondale, the former DL&amp;W line east to the Delaware Water Gap and the former Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad third-rail interurban streetcar line south to Montage Mountain, Moosic and the Minooka Industrial Track. These lines host the seasonal passenger trains of both the Steamtown National Historic Site and the Electric City Trolley Museum and are under the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Railroad Authority.

The PNRRA was created by Lackawanna County and Monroe County to oversee the use of common rail freight lines in Northeastern Pennsylvania, including one formerly owned by Conrail running from Scranton, through the Pocono Mountains towards New Jersey and New York City markets.

One of its primary objectives is to reestablish rail passenger service to Hoboken, New Jersey and New York City. Regular passenger train service to Scranton is slated to be restored under a plan to extend NJ Transit service from Hoboken via the Lackawanna Cut-Off. That project is ongoing as rail is being laid down in New Jersey. The trains would pass the Lackawanna Station building and pull in at the new Scranton station on Lackawanna Avenue along the northernmost track east of Bridge 60, the railroad bridge over the Lackawanna River, and the Cliff Street underpass. In December 2023, the Federal Railroad Administration granted $500,000 for planning studies into the Scranton to New York City corridor to fulfill step 1 of its Corridor Identification and Development Program.

<text>Throop is a borough in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, United States, adjoining Scranton. Formerly, coal mining and silk manufacturing provided employment for the people of Throop, who numbered 2,204 in 1900 and 5,133 in 1910. In 1940, 7,382 people lived in Throop. The population was 4,078 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land. It is bordered to the northeast by Olyphant, to the north by Blakely, to the northwest by Dickson City, to the west by Scranton, and to the south by Dunmore.

==History and notable features==
On April 7, 1911, a fire at the Price-Pancoast Colliery killed 72 coal miners in what has been described as &quot;the most appalling mine disaster in the history of the northern anthracite coal fields.&quot;

The borough contains a lead-contaminated parcel of land commonly known as the Marjol Battery site. Now owned by Gould Electronics, the empty land was a former battery processing facility closed in April 1982. Since the late 1980s, the federal United States Environmental Protection Agency and the state DEP have worked to clean up contamination in adjacent areas, but a final remedy for the site itself has remained on hold in recent years, as local officials and citizens fight with the government agencies and Gould over the best solution. In the meantime, the landowner has maintained a policy of basic containment and monitoring.

Throop&#x27;s most popular summertime event is its annual Cow Flop, organized by the Throop Booster Club. It has been a tradition in Throop since the late 1980s. The Flop serves as a fundraiser for the club and usually raises about $10,000 annually to benefit youth baseball and softball programs in the borough. The Flop, formerly held on a Sunday in late June, is now a two-day (since 2007) event that features a parade, fireworks, music, food, and other entertainment. The event requires more than 100 volunteers, mostly members of the Booster Club and parents of Throop athletes, to produce. The main event of the Cow Flop is the raffle involving 2,000 squares and a cow&#x27;s pick as to where she will relieve herself. Raffle tickets are $10 and the winner of the annual Flop raffle wins $5,000.

<doc id="132876" wikidata="Q1142221" url="?curid=132876" title="The Makropulos Affair (opera)">
<text>The Makropulos Affair (or &quot;The Makropoulos Case&quot;, &quot;The Makropulos Secret&quot;, or, literally, &quot;The Makropulos Thing&quot;; Czech Věc Makropulos) is a Czech opera in 3 acts, with music and libretto by Leoš Janáček. Janáček based his opera on the play &quot;Věc Makropulos&quot; by Karel Čapek. Composed between 1923 and 1925, &quot;The Makropulos Affair&quot; was his penultimate opera and, like much of his later work, was inspired by his infatuation with Kamila Stösslová, a married woman much younger than himself.

The opera received its world premiere at the National Theatre in Brno on 18 December 1926, conducted by František Neumann.

==Composition history==
Janáček had seen the play early in its run in Prague on 10 December 1922, and immediately saw its potential as an opera. He entered into a correspondence with Čapek, who was accommodating towards the idea, although legal problems in securing the rights to the play delayed work. When these problems were cleared on 10 September 1923, Janáček began work on the opera. By December 1924, he had completed the first draft of the work. He spent another year refining the score, before completing it on 3 December 1925.

Musically, much of the piece has little in the way of thematic development, instead presenting the listener with a mass of different motifs and ideas. Janáček&#x27;s writings indicate that this was a deliberate ploy to give musical embodiment to the disruptive, unsettling main character Emilia Marty/Elina Makropulos. Only at the end of the final act, when Makropulos&#x27; vulnerability is revealed, does the music tap into and develop the rich lyrical vein that has driven it throughout.

==Performance history==
Janáček was making adjustments to the score almost right up to the premiere in Brno. Two years after its premiere, the opera was given in Prague, and also in Germany in 1929, but it did not become really popular until a production by the Sadler&#x27;s Wells company in London in 1964, conducted by Charles Mackerras with Marie Collier as Emilia Marty. While performed with some regularity, it has not become part of the core opera repertory in the same way as have &quot;Jenůfa&quot;, &quot;Káťa Kabanová&quot; or &quot;The Cunning Little Vixen&quot;.

In 1966, the San Francisco Opera gave the first US performances (in an English translation), also with Marie Collier in the lead role. The first New York City performance was in December 1967, by the Little Orchestra Society with Naděžda Kniplová as Emilia Marty. The first Metropolitan Opera production of the opera, in an English translation, had its opening night on 5 January 1996, but ended prematurely only a few minutes into act 1 when tenor Richard Versalle, 63, whilst climbing the ladder which was part of the set, fell from the ladder, from a heart attack, immediately after singing Vitek&#x27;s line: &quot;Too bad you can only live so long&quot;. His death was reported that same evening. The scheduled second performance on 8 January 1996 was cancelled because of severe winter weather, and the first full performance of the Metropolitan Opera production did not take place until 11 January 1996. The first Metropolitan Opera performances of the work in the original Czech occurred in April 1998.

Tomáš Šimerda directed a 2001 version of the opera for Czech television, with Gabriela Beňačková as Emilia Marty, and a cast that included Roman Sadnik, Jan Hladík, Zdeněk Šmukař, Monika Brychtová, and Pavel Kamas, with the Brno National Theatre Chorus and Orchestra and conductor Oliver von Dohnányi. The opera has been performed twice at The Proms, in August 1995 (the Glyndebourne production presented in concert at the Royal Albert Hall) and in August 2016 (with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, in a semi-staged concert version).

The Australian premiere was in 1996, with the Australian Opera, conducted by David Stanhope.

Karita Mattila sang the title role in a San Francisco Opera production in November 2010. The production was filmed live, and was later streamed for free for two days in July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Mattila reprised the role at the Metropolitan Opera in April 2012, in Helsinki at the Finnish National Opera in August–September 2012, and in the semi-staged version at The Proms in the Royal Albert Hall in August 2016.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
===Act 1===
&quot;Kolenatý&#x27;s law office, Prague, 1922&quot;

Vitek, Kolenatý&#x27;s clerk, notes that the probate case of &quot;Gregor v. Prus&quot; has been going on for almost a century. Kolenatý represents the middle-class Gregors against the wealthy and aristocratic Prus family. Albert Gregor comes in to ask about the case. Kolenatý is at the Supreme Court, but has not returned because he is expecting the final resolution. Vitek&#x27;s daughter Kristina, enters. She is a young opera singer, and praises Emilia Marty, a famous singer she has seen rehearsing, and admits that she will never be the artist Emilia Marty is.

Kolenatý returns to his law office. Emilia Marty enters displaying an interest in the Gregor case, which Kolenatý summarizes for her. Baron Joseph Ferdinand Prus died in 1827, leaving no will or legitimate children. His cousin claimed the estate, but so did Albert&#x27;s ancestor, Ferdinand Gregor, who asserted that the Baron had promised the estate to him. Each party presented different evidence to support their case, but neither could proffer an actual will. Here Emilia interrupts. Speaking with unusual familiarity of these long-ago events, she states that Ferdinand Gregor was the out-of-wedlock son of Baron Joseph (who was a very centered and diligent man, contradicting Dr. Kolenatý&#x27;s description) and opera singer Ellian MacGregor. Kolenatý says that the case seems to be on the side of the Prus family, because there is no will. Emilia asks what would be required for Albert Gregor to win, and Kolenatý answers that the missing will is such an item. Emilia says that there is in fact a will, and describes an old cupboard in the Prus mansion where important papers were kept, where that document may be found.

Kolenatý thinks Emilia is inventing stories, but Albert insists that Kolenatý investigate at once, and even threatens to take the case to a rival lawyer. Kolenatý leaves, and Albert tells Emilia that if he does not get the estate, he will be penniless and shoot himself. He is already infatuated with Emilia, and makes advances to her. But Emilia, bored and indifferent, coldly refuses him. However, she asks his help in retrieving a document that will be found with the will.

Kolenatý returns with Jaroslav Prus. They found the will where Emilia said it would be, and Jaroslav congratulates Albert on his victory – if he can prove that Ferdinand Gregor was the Baron&#x27;s out-of-wedlock son. Emilia says that she can prove that.

===Act 2===
&quot;The empty stage of the opera house&quot;

A stagehand and a cleaning woman discuss Emilia&#x27;s extraordinary performance. Jaroslav Prus enters, seeking Emilia, accompanied by his young son Janek, and Kristina. Kristina is in love with, and in a relationship with, Janek.

Emilia enters, but spurns them all, including Janek, who falls under her spell, and Albert, who brings her expensive flowers. The old Count Hauk-Šendorf enters, and thinks he recognizes Emilia as Eugenia Montez, a Romani woman with whom he had an affair in Andalusia half a century before. Emilia tells him Eugenia is not dead, and in Spanish, calls him by a pet name and asks him for a kiss.

All except Jaroslav leave. He demands an explanation of her strange interest in his family, and reveals that the mother of the Baron&#x27;s child was recorded as &quot;Elina Makropulos&quot;, who might be the same as &quot;Ellian MacGregor&quot;, whose love letters he has read. Prus describes her as a passionate woman with flexible morals, to which Emilia takes offense. He continues saying that only a descendant of Ferdinand Makropoulos can claim the estate. Emilia offers to buy a mysterious document found with the will, but Jaroslav refuses and leaves. Albert returns and again pleads his love, but Emilia merely falls asleep, and Albert leaves. Janek returns, and Emilia asks him to get the document for her. Jaroslav overhears this, and orders Janek to leave. He then agrees to provide the document himself if Emilia will spend the night with him.

===Act 3===
&quot;Emila&#x27;s hotel room the next morning&quot;

Emilia and Jaroslav have spent the night together. Though disappointed by Emilia&#x27;s coldness, Jaroslav nonetheless gives her the envelope containing the document. News arrives that his son Janek has committed suicide because of his infatuation with Emilia. Jaroslav grieves, but Emilia is indifferent. Jaroslav hardly has time to express his anger at her reaction before Count Hauk-Šendorf enters. Hauk-Šendorf says that he has left his wife and wants to elope with Emilia to Spain. Albert, Kolenatý, and Kristina enter, with a doctor who takes Count Hauk-Šendorf away. Kolenatý has noticed that Emilia&#x27;s handwriting matches that of Ellian MacGregor and suspects her of forgery. She leaves the room to get dressed, and says that after she has had her breakfast, she will clarify everything.

The rest of the party begins to search her papers and belongings. The searchers find many documents and keepsakes, all bearing names with the initials &#x27;E.M.&#x27; Jaroslav says that the handwriting of Elina Makropulos on Ferdinand&#x27;s birth certificate also matches that of Emilia.

Emilia returns, drunk and with a pistol, but Albert disarms her. Emilia decides to tell the truth. She is Elina Makropulos, born in 1575 (not 1585, as in Čapek&#x27;s eponymous original stage play, which premiered in 1922), daughter of Hieronymus Makropulos, an alchemist in Emperor Rudolf II&#x27;s Court, who ordered him to prepare a potion that would extend his life. When the potion was ready, the Emperor ordered his alchemist to test it on his daughter first. She fell into a coma, and Hieronymus was sent to prison. After a week, Elina woke up and fled with the formula, which proved successful. She has since lived an itinerant life for three centuries, becoming one of the best singers of all time. To conceal her longevity, she has assumed many identities, including &#x27;Eugenia Montez&#x27;, &#x27;Ekaterina Myshkin&#x27;, and &#x27;Ellian McGregor&#x27;. She confided her secret to Baron Joseph and gave him the formula, which he attached to his will for his son. However, the document was lost among the Baron&#x27;s papers after his death.

The potion is finally wearing off. Elina had wanted the formula to gain another 300 years of life. As the first signs of old age appear on her face, the others, initially disbelieving her story, come to believe her, and to feel pity for her. Elina has realized that perpetual youth has led her to exhausted apathy and resolves to allow death to come naturally to her, understanding that a sense of transcendence and purpose come from a naturally short span of life. Aging rapidly before the eyes of the astonished onlookers, she offers Kristina the formula so she now can become a great artist herself. However, Kristina burns the parchment in a candle flame. Elina collapses as she recites the first words of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in Greek.

Elizabeth Township was established in 1757 as a split off Warwick Township. It was split again in 1853 to create the present Clay Township to the east.

In early colonial days, the area now comprising Elizabeth Township played an important part in the development of the county. The village of Brickerville dates from 1741, when the area&#x27;s first blast furnace was built to make cast iron from ore from the Cornwall mines. Stiegel glass manufacturing, dating from 1757, soon grew into an international export. Iron production grew, reaching its peak &quot;circa&quot; 1780 and continuing until 1856. The supplying of charcoal from area forests to feed the furnaces over this period became an important related industry.

<text>Lancaster Township is a civil township of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is in the central area of the county, and it immediately surrounds Lancaster City. As of the 2020 census, the township population was 18,591.

Lancaster Township is one of the six immediate suburbs of the city of Lancaster, all sharing the same official designation as Lancaster, Pennsylvania, by the United States Postal Service.

==History==
Lancaster Township was established in 1729 as one of seventeen original townships in Lancaster County. It was the smallest of the townships, with its boundaries being defined by the Conestoga River, Manor Township, the Little Conestoga Creek, (East) Hempfield Township, and Manheim Township. A two-mile square was later cut out of the northern part of Lancaster Township to create the county seat of Lancaster City.

The creation of the county caused an influx of people to come to Lancaster City, and Lancaster Township, its closest suburb, received many people too, with many people living here and working in the city. As Lancaster became larger and more prominent, larger roads and railroads needed to extend out to its suburbs, including Lancaster Township. The town even had its own canal, the Conestoga Navigation Canal on the Conestoga River.

Lancaster Township&#x27;s growth was slow but steady, with about 150 people joining the community each decade prior to 1900. Since then, as the Industrial Revolution came to a close, Lancaster Township has been transformed into a mostly residential municipality.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , all land. It is bounded by the Conestoga River to the south and east and its tributary, Little Conestoga Creek, to the west.

Most of the township lies to the west and south of the city of Lancaster, but smaller exclaves of the township lie to the east and southeast of the city. Its neighboring municipalities are Manheim Township, the city of Lancaster, East Lampeter Township, Pequea Township, the borough of Millersville, Manor Township, and East Hempfield Township.

The township contains the village of Bausman, an unincorporated community that has its own post office and ZIP code (17504), while the rest of the township is covered by 17603 and 17602. Other named locations in the township are School Lane Hills, Woodlawn, Hamilton Park, Colonial Manor, Wabank, Engleside, and Conestoga Woods.

The township is home to President James Buchanan&#x27;s summer residence, Wheatland, located at 1120 Marietta Avenue. The 1828 Federal-style mansion is a National Historic Landmark and has been restored to reflect the period of Buchanan&#x27;s occupancy in the mid-19th century. Wheatland is featured within the township&#x27;s seal.

==Government and politics==
Lancaster Township is governed by a three-member Board of Supervisors, who serve staggered six-year terms. The current supervisors are Steven Elliott, Benjamin Bamford, and Iber Guerrero Lopez. Their terms expire at the end of 2024, 2022, and 2026, respectively.

In the municipal election on November 3, 2009, Tony Allen was defeated in his bid for a fourth term as supervisor by Democrat Benjamin Bamford in a very close race. Initial results gave Bamford an 11-vote margin of victory, or less than one-half of one percent of votes cast. Unofficial results had 1,188 votes for Bamford to 1,177 votes for Allen. After 27 registered voters petitioned the elections board, a later manual recount increased Bamford&#x27;s margin to 13 votes out of 2,371 votes cast, with 1,192 votes for Bamford to Allen&#x27;s 1,179 (50.2% to 49.8%). In a county with a strong history of voting for Republicans, Bamford&#x27;s victory made history. When Bamford took office, Lancaster Township became the first township in the county to be governed by a board that was majority Democratic.

<text>Optoelectronics (or optronics) is the study and application of electronic devices and systems that find, detect and control light, usually considered a sub-field of photonics. In this context, &quot;light&quot; often includes invisible forms of radiation such as gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet and infrared, in addition to visible light. Optoelectronic devices are electrical-to-optical or optical-to-electrical transducers, or instruments that use such devices in their operation.

&quot;Electro-optics&quot; is often erroneously used as a synonym, but is a wider branch of physics that concerns all interactions between light and electric fields, regardless of whether they form part of an electronic device.

Optoelectronics is based on the quantum mechanical effects of light on electronic materials, especially semiconductors, sometimes in the presence of electric fields.
* Photoelectric or photovoltaic effect, used in:
** photodiodes (including solar cells)
** phototransistors
** photomultipliers
** optoisolators
** integrated optical circuit (IOC) elements
* Photoconductivity, used in:
** photoresistors
** photoconductive camera tubes
** charge-coupled imaging devices
* Stimulated emission, used in:
** injection laser diodes
** quantum cascade lasers
* Lossev effect, or radiative recombination, used in:
** light-emitting diodes or LED
** OLEDs
* Photoemissivity, used in
** photoemissive camera tube

Important applications of optoelectronics include:

==History==
On February 7, 1738, a petition was signed by many citizens of Drumore Township, Pennsylvania to create a new township, due to Drumore getting too big. They had a hard time thinking of a new name, though finally John Jamison, one of the oldest and most prominent citizens, proposed that it be called Little Britain Township in memory of most of the settlers&#x27; mother country. For over one hundred years, Little Britain Township&#x27;s boundaries remained unchanged, until 1844 when Fulton Township was formed. Although Robert Fulton, credited with the development of the steamship, was born in Little Britain, his birthplace is within the border of present-day Fulton Township.

The Kirks Mills Historic District and Pine Grove Covered Bridge are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Manor Township is a second-class township in west-central Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 21,920.

== History to 1763==

Manor Township takes its name from the Manor of Conestoga, which was originally surveyed and reserved for William Penn in 1719, although there is evidence that William Penn visited this area prior to 1690. At this time, the area was Susquehannock territory, and the Susquehannock tribe themselves were the largest tribe in the Susquehanna Valley and had their center of the community within the Turkey Hill part of this territory. The Quaker government thus had surveyors lay off a large area bounded by the Little Conestoga Creek near what is now Millersville to the Susquehanna River and the Conestoga Creek.

When the land was ceded by William Penn to their ancestors in the 1690s, the Susquehannock tribe had lived on the land for quite some time. Their ancestors were Conestoga Native Americans, many of whom were Christian and had lived peacefully with their European neighbors for decades by bartering handicrafts, hunting, and receiving subsistence food given them by the Pennsylvania government. The area was called the Manor of Conestoga and may have been (as some historians speculate that it was) set aside by William Penn as a domain in which the Susquehannock tribe could live and hunt. The Manor contained 16,000 acres east of the Susquehanna River, thus being mostly well-watered flat land that contained rich and fertile soil.

Until the French and Indian War, however, the frontier of Pennsylvania remained largely unsettled. In the aftermath of the war, a new wave of Scots-Irish immigrants who are now known locally as &quot;The Paxton Boys&quot; encroached on the Penn-ceded land in the back country, often doing so in blatant violation of previously-signed treaties. Reverend John Elder, who was the parson at Paxtang, became a leader of these settlers, was known as the &quot;Fighting Parson&quot;, and kept his rifle in the pulpit while he delivered his sermons. Elder then helped organize the settlers into a mounted militia and was named Captain of the group, whom called themselves the &quot;Pextony boys&quot; and claimed that the Natives often raided their homes and killed men, women and children.

Although there had been neither Susquehannock nor Conestoga attacks in the area, the Pextony Boys claimed that the Conestoga secretly provided aid and intelligence to their enemies. At daybreak on December 14, 1763, the vigilante group of the Scots-Irish frontiersmen attacked Conestoga homes at Conestoga Town (near present-day Millersville) and scalped and otherwise mutilated the males, raped and murdered the women and children, and burned their cabins, massacring all but 16 of the Natives. The colonial government then held an inquest, and the new governor, John Penn, offered a reward for capture of the Pextony Boys. Penn placed the remaining sixteen Conestoga in protective custody in Lancaster, though the Pextony Boys broke in on December 27, 1763, and murdered as well as dismembered six adults and eight children. The government of Pennsylvania offered a new reward after this second attack, this time $600, for the capture of anyone involved, but the attackers were never identified.

Manor Township therefore still memorializes the murdered Natives by using as its official logo a Native American Chief in full headdress with the date 1763 below it.

==1763 to 1863==

For the next 100 years, the township was subdivided as the large plantations in were cut into smaller tracts to accommodate growing families. In 1846, the 83rd year, the iron industry came to the Township in 1846 when the Iron Works factory was built in the village of Safe Harbor. The Iron Works factory provided jobs for heads of the households as well as the T-shaped rail that was the principal product of the mill.

When the Civil War came close to Manor Township in 1863, the 100th year, Governor Curtin called every able-bodied man to enroll for the defense of the entire State of Pennsylvania. Citizens of Manor Township and Millersville assembled at the headquarters at Safe Harbor, although the invasion threat to Lancaster County ended as the Columbia-Wrightsville Bridge was burned and Lee&#x27;s army was defeated at the Battle of Gettysburg.

==1863 and thereafter==

By 1880, the population of Manor Township was approximately 4,000 people. From the late 1800s through the mid 1900s, the township was known for producing fine tobacco crops, and its farmers produced more tobacco than any township in Lancaster County. Churches and schools were built as the area continued to grow, and the railroad along the western boundary of the township enabled the development of more factories, including a woolen factory near Safe Harbor, match factory in Safe Harbor, and an implement factory near Millersville. In April 1930, construction began on the dam for the Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation and was completed twenty months later.

In 1973, Washington Boro officially merged into Manor Township, and most of Manor Township has remained rural and agricultural in use. The land is considered by soil scientists to be as fertile as any in the United States, and the vast majority of development has occurred in the north eastern section of the Township.

==History==

On January 11, 1814, Isaac Rohrer laid out the town that became known as Mountville, dividing it into 130 building lots, sold by lottery. Located east of Columbia in West Hempfield Township on the Lancaster and Susquehanna Turnpike, Mountville was originally named &quot;Mount Pleasant&quot; because it was situated on an elevation affording a pleasant view of the surrounding countryside in every direction.

In 1842, when the first post office was established in the town, the name was changed to &quot;Mountville&quot; because the postal service already had another Mount Pleasant registered in Pennsylvania.

Recognizing the need for a municipal water system, the town incorporated as a borough in 1906.

After several annexations of land adjoining the borough through the years since, Mountville now consists of just under one square mile of residential, commercial, industrial and public property. Mountville boasts one of the highest ratios of public park space per capita. With slightly more than 2,800 residents, the borough is served by the West Hempfield Township Police Department, protected by the Mountville Volunteer Fire Company, and educated by the Hempfield School District.

During the American Revolution, Reamstown served as one of a number of field hospitals for the wounded following the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777. A dozen or more of these troops died here and are buried in unmarked graves in the Salem Evangelical Cemetery. The cemetery is also home to a large boulder that once served as a mortar and pestle by the native people who lived on nearby Ephrata Mountain to the south. It was transported to Reamstown by Pierce Lesher, and today a plaque on the stone details both the Native American and military history.

<text>West Donegal Township is a township in northwestern Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 8,870 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The township derives its name from Donegal, a town in Ireland. The original township of Donegal was organized by the court of Chester County in 1722, and was one of the two townships which composed Lancaster County at the time of its erection in 1729. On June 24, 1838, a division was effected, whereby the old township was constituted into two townships, to be separately and distinctly recognized as East Donegal and West Donegal.

==R.E. Pierson Quarry Controversy==
R.E. Pierson Materials is a corporation from New Jersey that has a location in Rheems, a town in West Donegal. They are recently facing controversy for expanding their quarry into thirty acres of farmland.

A council meeting was recently held in which over 12 people spoke against the rezoning of the farmland. Margaretta S. Lisi of Heisey Quarry Road was one of them. She stated that she was &quot;flabbergasted&quot; about the matter. Her 12-year-old grandson, Ben Koser, urged Pierson not to &quot;take away the magic of the farmland.&quot; Erik Hume, representing Pierson, falsely claimed that the rezoning would be further away from any residences than the current quarry. A resident was heard mocking Hume during the meeting and was asked by a board member to stop. “The windows shake and rattle,” said Jennifer Pollock, a resident living near the rezone area. Margaretta&#x27;s lawyer, Veronica Morrison of the Mette, Evans &amp; Woodside law firm, repeatedly claimed that the hearing was not advertised correctly. Township solicitor Josele Cleary argued back that it was advertised correctly. The matter ended up being tabled, and it will be heard about again as soon as next month.
As of October 2021, It has been decided by the council that the thirty acres of land will be expanded. Chairman Douglas Hottenstein, Treasurer Eric Kreider, and Member Ralph Horne voted in favor of R.E. Pierson. Vice-Chairman Roger Snyder was the only member to vote against the quarry. Secretary Philip Dunn was absent from the meeting.

==History==
The settlers of West Donegal were of Scots-Irish descent and were primarily farmers who were drawn to the area by the rich soils and plentiful streams. Thus the abundant produce provided by the land was able to be made into flour by the many mills which sprang up in the area.

Early settlers, Arthur Patterson and others, organized a Presbyterian Church at Donegal in 1726, and erected the old church edifice at that time. The first three pastors of it were from Scotland. Bartram Galbraith, grandson of James Galbraith, was Lieutenant for Lancaster County, the first three years of the Revolution, and many members of that family served in various official positions, as also did Alexander Lowrey and several of that family.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , all land. It is named after County Donegal, Ireland. The northwestern border of the township, which is also the border with Dauphin County, is formed by Conewago Creek. The township is bordered to the northeast by the borough of Elizabethtown.

The area of Big Beaver Township suffered growth and loss over the next seventy five years. Two world wars and several depressions saw the population and industry decline. The Borough of Wampum, in search of a larger tax base, decided to annex the Medusa Cement Plant from Big Beaver Township. At that time, according to Pennsylvania state law, a township could not prevent a borough from annexing property and Wampum succeeded in annexing the property into Wampum. Shortly after this, the Borough of Ellwood began to consider annexing the property south of the cement plant. In 1958, the township trustees began the process of changing Big Beaver Township into the Borough of New Beaver in order to prevent the further annexation. The charter was signed on November 18, 1959, however the community continued to operate as a township until elections could be held in 1961.

<text>New Castle is a city in and the county seat of Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, United States. Located along the Shenango River at the mouth of Neshannock Creek, it is northwest of Pittsburgh near the Pennsylvania–Ohio border, approximately southeast of Youngstown, Ohio. The city had a population of 21,926 as of the 2020 census. The commercial center of a fertile agricultural region, New Castle is included in the northwestern fringes of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
===18th century===
In 1798, John Carlysle Stewart, a civil engineer, traveled to western Pennsylvania to resurvey the &quot;donation lands&quot;, which had been reserved for veterans of the Revolutionary War. He discovered that the original survey had neglected to stake out approximately at the confluence of the Shenango River and Neshannock Creek, at that time a part of Allegheny County. The Indian town of Kuskusky was listed on early maps in this location. Claiming the land for himself, he laid out in April 1798 what was to become the town of New Castle. It comprised approximately that same , in what was then part of Allegheny County.
===19th century===
In 1825, New Castle became a borough, having a population of about 300. The city later became a part of Mercer County. On April 5, 1849, the governor of Pennsylvania signed an act creating Lawrence County, named in honor of U.S. Navy Captain James Lawrence. New Castle became a city in 1869 and was headed by its first mayor, Thomas B. Morgan. At that time, the population had increased to about 6,000.

In 1849, a group of Old Order Amish families from Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, settled just north of New Castle in New Wilmington. Later migrations from Holmes County, Ohio, would make this Amish community one of the largest in Pennsylvania. Approximately 2,000 Amish live and work presently in the townships north of New Castle.

Business in New Castle began to flourish in the early 19th century with the construction of the Beaver and Erie Canal system, which made its way through the city. Numerous manufacturing plants became located in New Castle because of the availability of transportation facilities and ready access to raw material markets. The canal system was later supplemented and then replaced by railroads which offered greater speed and capacity for freight, as well as year-round service.

In the 1870s, the city became a major hub of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. New Castle&#x27;s population swelled from 11,600 in 1890 to 28,339 in 1900, and to 38,280 in 1910, as immigrants, particularly from Italy, flocked to the city to work in the mills and nearby limestone quarries. Italian laborers of the era were frequent victims of the Black Hand society, which employed blackmail and extortion to rob the workers of their pay. In 1907 the headquarters of the Black Hand for the entire region was discovered in the village of Hillsville a few miles west of New Castle. By this time New Castle was one of the fastest-growing cities in the country, and with the construction of the largest tin plate mill in America, the city became the tin plate capital of the world. The tin plate industry marked a new increase in the city&#x27;s prosperity.

===20th century===

In 1908, New Castle was linked to Pittsburgh by the Pittsburgh, Harmony, Butler and New Castle Railway, an interurban trolley line. Steel and paper mills, foundries, a bronze bushing factory, and car-construction plants contributed to the region&#x27;s economy. Shenango China produced commercial china and created the fine Castleton China line for the White House, including dinnerware for Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson. Other ceramic factories produced bathroom fixtures and industrial refractory materials.

In the 1920s, New Castle enjoyed its greatest prosperity. The landscape of the city was transformed with the building of many beautiful structures, some of which still stand, such as the Scottish Rite Cathedral, St. Mary&#x27;s Church, and the Castleton Hotel. The city also established its identity. New Castle is known both as the &quot;hot dog capital of the world&quot; and the &quot;fireworks capital of America&quot;. Its chili dogs are the product of Greek immigrants who came to New Castle in the early 20th century and established restaurants along with their homes. The renown for fireworks is credited to two local fireworks companies of international stature, S.Vitale Pyrotechnic Industries, Inc. (Pyrotecnico) and Zambelli Internationale. The first fireworks manufacturer in New Castle was Leopold Fazzoni, who owned and operated the Fazzoni Brothers Fireworks Company. Fazzoni came to New Castle from Italy in 1886 and worked in the tin mills to earn enough money to start his own business. He was issued the first certificate for fireworks manufacturing in the state. Of the people who worked with the Fazzoni family, many founded their own businesses, such as Paul Rozzi, Jacob Conti, Constantino Vitale, and Joseph Zambelli.

Despite recent economic challenges, the city continues to serve as the headquarters of Pyrotecnico Fireworks, the winner of the 2008 Gold Jupiter, awarded at the world&#x27;s most prestigious fireworks venue: LaRonde in Montreal, Canada. The company was started by Constantino Vitale in Italy in 1889, who immigrated to New Castle in the 1920s, continuing his business there. Five generations of the Vitale family have transformed the company. In the 1990s the company&#x27;s name was changed to Pyrotecnico and has grown to be a world leader in the industry. Also located in New Castle is Zambelli Fireworks, which was founded in New Castle. Zambelli Fireworks is one of the world&#x27;s leading fireworks and pyrotechnics companies. These fireworks companies have been featured in venues such as presidential celebrations and Super Bowls. Pyrotecnico and Zambelli Fireworks have changed the face of the fireworks industry. This has gained the city the nickname of &quot;Fireworks Capital of America&quot;. New Castle has recently opened Zambelli Plaza near the Cascade Center in 2007 in honor of the Zambelli family&#x27;s accomplishments.

In the 1930s, the city, along with most cities of America, suffered during the Great Depression. During this time, the federal government established the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). These programs offered jobs to many displaced workers. Many of the stone walls built by the WPA and the CCC still stand as a reminder of the historic demise of the economy. In the 1940s, industry temporarily surged during wartime.

In 1950, the population peaked at 48,834, but became part of the Rust Belt, with population dwindling to 28,334 by 1990. New Castle is the county seat of Lawrence County which has a population of approximately 91,000.

In 1998, New Castle was a host city for the History Channel Great Race. Over 15,000 spectators gathered downtown for the festivities. The city celebrated its 200th birthday in 1998 with a downtown fireworks festival that attracted over 30,000 people.

The Lawrence County Courthouse, North Hill Historic District, and Scottish Rite Cathedral are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Economy==

Downtown New Castle underwent a redevelopment centered around the Cascade Center. The downtown streets and sidewalks were rebuilt in the early 21st century in earlier styles. The revitalization of downtown also saw two major routes into the city, Pennsylvania Route 65 and U.S. Route 224, which had both had their termini extended into downtown in 2007.

InfoCision, a telemarketing services company, restored the former New Castle Dry Goods Co. building, into which it relocated its offices from their former location inside Cascade Galleria. The building had been vacant since the late 1980s when the Troutman&#x27;s department store closed. The building is now known as the Pier I Complex Building.

The downtown area has also become the home of several bank offices, hosting the regional headquarters of Huntington and First Commonwealth (all descended from banks formerly based in the city but later acquired) as well as branches for PNC Bank and First National Bank. FirstMerit also had its regional headquarters in New Castle prior to their acquisition by Huntington, and that building is expected to be town down in 2020. Mellon Bank also had offices across the street from the current Zambelli Plaza before selling off its New Castle-area branches to First National Bank, which closed the office building since it already had the aforementioned branch in downtown.

As of 2018, New Castle employed 8,677 people. Industries employing the most were healthcare, social assistance, utilities, transportation and warehouses. Healthcare and social assistance employed 1,724 people, followed by retail trade with 1,172 employees and then manufacturing employing 1,012 employees.

Over the past 40 years, New Castle has been transformed from an industrial economy to a more balanced economy based on manufacturing, retail, and service-related businesses. Many buildings and old homes were being renovated by incoming residents.

White workers made 1.66 times the amount of salary that African American workers made. African Americans make the second highest salary of any race or ethnicity in New Castle.

==Arts and culture==

The city was the site of an important development in the history of the Warner Bros. empire, given that the first Warner Brothers&#x27; theatre, the Cascade, opened here in 1907. The building was nearly condemned in 1996 after a wall fell on the sidewalk. Warner Bros. donated $150,000, which the Pennsylvania government matched, to restore the facade. Municipal officials have planned recent revitalization efforts around the historic site. The Cascade Center currently features two restaurants and a local stage theater, and plans are in progress to turn the complex into New Castle&#x27;s version of Station Square in Pittsburgh.

The Cascade Center is named after Cascade Park, located on the outskirts of the city&#x27;s East Side in Shenango Township along Pennsylvania Route 65. A former trolley park, it was restored and converted into a regular outdoor park in the 1980s with a few historical buildings as well as the park&#x27;s entrance sign restored, avoiding the fate of nearby Idora Park in Youngstown. The park hosts the annual &quot;Back to the 50s Weekend&quot; classic car show, and previously hosted the similarly themed &quot;Thunder in the Cascades&quot; motorcycle show.

The New Castle Playhouse, a community theatre, is located along Long Avenue and puts on several shows a year. It is one of only a few such theatres between Youngstown and Pittsburgh. The Old Princeton School, located nearby, has been the venue for rock concerts.

In the 2011 movie &quot;Super 8&quot;, New Castle is referenced as the &quot;fireworks capital of the world&quot;.

New Castle is the subject of the true crime blog &quot;Small Town Noir&quot;, which uses mug shots taken in New Castle between 1930 and 1960, and which were rescued when the town&#x27;s police department threw them out. The information on the images comes from the &quot;New Castle News&quot;.

New Castle has a large Arab-American population whose culture is visible throughout the community. Large numbers of Lebanese and Syrian immigrants were attracted by the city&#x27;s prosperity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Their culture is especially visible in the local cuisine, which makes popular use of items such as stuffed grape leaves, lamb on the rod, kibbe, and garlic sauce. Although many other Rust Belt cities contain large Arab-American populations, New Castle is unique for its large population of Alawite Muslims from Syria. The Muslim community of the city has a mosque on the East Side of town.

New Castle has public transportation in the form of the New Castle Transit Authority, which provides bus service to patrons around the city and makes three daily trips to Pittsburgh.

The city is served by numerous highways, with Pennsylvania Route 18 and U.S. Route 422 being the major routes running through the city, while Interstate 376 passes to the west of the city. Two more major routes — Pennsylvania Route 65 and U.S. Route 224 — terminate in the city. Pennsylvania Route 108 and Pennsylvania Route 168 also run through the city. U.S. 422 Business, a former alignment of U.S. 422, runs through the city, ending on each side of the city when the main 422 leaves the New Castle Bypass. I-376 and U.S. 422 are briefly concurrent with each other on the New Castle Bypass, though south of New Castle until Chippewa Township near Beaver Falls, I-376 is tolled by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. The city is located west of Interstate 79, south of Interstate 80, and north of Interstate 76, the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

The closest airport is the New Castle Municipal Airport, with no commercial service. Most residents of New Castle use Pittsburgh International Airport which is about south of downtown. Also, Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport, Akron-Canton Airport, and Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, are all within of the city center.

===Healthcare===
New Castle&#x27;s only hospital is UPMC Jameson, located at the intersection of Wilmington Avenue and Garfield Avenue.

Medicare reimbursements per enrollee were $11,153 in 2014, but $11,196 in 2013. Medicare reimbursements per enrollee in Lawrence County are $1,565 more than national average.

In 1847 an Amish settlement was established between New Wilmington and Volant. On April 4, 1863, New Wilmington was established as a half-Borough, and on April 9, 1873, it was made a full borough. The population in 1874 was 500. As of the 2000 census, the population had grown to 2,452, which included 1,315 residents and 1,137 college students.

A book on the complete history of New Wilmington was penned in 1999, which may be viewed at the Westminster College Library. The book includes 12 chapters of history, starting in 1797, and has over 100 photographs.

In the fall of 2014, community members led by mayor Sherie Babb, formed the New Wilmington Economic Development Committee. This group was established to encourage not only economic health, but a variety of betterment initiatives around the town.

In January 2016, &quot;LIVE New Wilmington&quot;, a promotional campaign developed and supported by the New Wilmington Economic Development Committee (EDCOM), was officially launched. The goal of this project is to promote connection and celebration as the residents join in a community that is a hub for artists and quality education, picturesque environment, and caring neighbors. Because of this, the group has chosen to focus on these areas (arts, education, environment, people) as the pillars for nurturing and fostering growth. It is believed that these qualities are unique to the community, deserve to be recognized, and should be given a larger platform for actualization.

S.N.P.J. stands for &quot;Slovenska Narodna Podporna Jednota&quot; &quot;(Slovene National Benefit Society)&quot;, a fraternal society and financial co-operative based in North Fayette, Pennsylvania. The society applied to have their recreation center in western Pennsylvania designated as a separate municipality in 1977. The S.N.P.J. borough was created so that the society could, among other things, get its own liquor license. North Beaver Township, the municipality in which the center was originally located, restricted the sale of alcohol on Sundays (blue law).

S.N.P.J. once had the distinction of being the least-populated borough in the state (but not municipality; East Fork Road District, population 14, was less populous) until a mine fire beneath Centralia made that borough unsafe to live in.

== Geography ==
S.N.P.J. is located at (40.928916, -80.498828).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , with of the area covered by water.

It is more of a recreation complex than a community, and has 60 rental cabins, 115 mobile home slots, and an artificial lake. It is open to the public as a summertime resort and facility for bingo, weddings, and dances. Members of the society get a discount on the events.

== History ==
Named for the Shenango River, Shenango Township was incorporated in 1804 as a part of Beaver County, Pennsylvania; Lawrence County did not yet exist. Shenango Township was carved out of the neighboring North Beaver Township, Pennsylvania. At the time of its establishment, Shenango Township stretched from the Shenango River to the Slippery Rock Creek gorge. Over the next 100 years portions of the township would be annexed or reduced to create, South New Castle Borough, Pollock Township (which later became the City of New Castle), Taylor Township, and Slippery Rock Township.

Shenango became one of Lawrence County&#x27;s original townships and quickly became one of the most populous areas, because the land was suitable for many different purposes. One of the first settlers to live in Shenango was William Carins. He came to this area in 1796 and was the man who gave Shenango its name. Carins was awarded the land after his service in the Revolutionary War; he was paid in of land. Carins worked as a cloth weaver and ran a small store where he sold his goods. William Tindall was another one of Shenango&#x27;s first settlers. Tindall was paid for his service in the Revolutionary War. He lived to the age of 93 and was buried in the Tindall family cemetery near the &quot;Turkey Hill&quot; section of the township. The Tindall family cemetery is most famously known as the resting place of Mary Black, a supposed, but never proven, witch of around the same time period. Her grave is separate from the others and is the only one dug up. Shenango&#x27;s largest land owner was a Philadelphia lawyer named Benjamin Chew. Chew bought up large portions of the southern extent of the township under assumed names for pennies an acre. He later resold the land for a profit, and the village of Chewton in Wayne Township was later named after him.

The township was linked to New Castle, Ellwood and Pittsburgh in 1908 by the Pittsburgh, Harmony, Butler and New Castle Railway, an interurban trolley line. The line closed on August 15, 1931, and the trolleys were replaced by buses.

The New Castle Armory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.

The Borough of South New Castle is planned to be re-annexed by the township on January 1st, 2026, after a successful vote on the merger in 2023.

==Residential==
Shenango Township is made up of several smaller residential neighborhoods which were built by local developers over the last 50 years. These neighborhoods are connected by the current state local road system in the township. Shenango saw its first residential developments in the late 1950s and 1960s with the construction of most of the homes that can be found today in Ridgewood Court and Willowhurst Circle. These two developments were built at the same time that a new high school was being constructed to serve the community. The 1970s and 1980s saw limited residential development throughout the township, possibly due to the struggling local economy at the time. The 1990s through the present have shown a great turnaround for the township, with the construction of several residential developments. Single family developments such as Woodland Hills, Deer Run, Orchardale Estates Phase I, Jason&#x27;s Woods Phase I &amp; II, and Cambridge at Hidden Lakes Phase I have led to a significant population growth in Shenango Township over the last 25 years. The construction of townhomes and condos in The Fields and Shenango Greens has added to the diversity of residences in Shenango Township.

<text>Volant is a borough in northern Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 127 at the 2020 census. Volant is surrounded by Old Order Amish farms of the New Wilmington settlement. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
The land on which the borough of Volant is situated was bought from Native Americans in 1784. The first gristmill was built on Neshannock Creek in 1806, upstream from the current site. It was abandoned after a few years, and a new mill was built in 1812.

In 1847, an Amish settlement was established between New Wilmington and Volant. In 1868, J.P. Locke purchased the mill and of land and began laying out a settlement of 30 lots, which he called Lockeville. With the help of the railroad, his attempts to create a settlement were successful. In June 1893, the settlement changed its name to Volant and was incorporated as a self-governing unit.

(In 1874, in amazement hunters exclaimed &quot;volant!&quot; as ducks took flight from a local pond. The name stuck and was changed in 1893. The Latin meaning of volant is &quot;they fly.&quot; https://www.visitpa.com/region/pittsburgh-its-countryside/volant )
The first store was built in 1877 by John and William Graham. By the turn of the 20th century the village turned into a commercial community. Thanks to the New Castle-Franklin railroad, Volant became a shopping district. The mill remained the nucleus of the town. Because of Volant&#x27;s rural location there was a livery stable, two harness shops, a blacksmith and a veterinarian. There was also a college which attracted students from the surrounding communities. As the town progressed toward establishing larger business ventures, a stone quarry was set up around 1900, along with a lumber mill and brick company. The growing need for petroleum spurred an oil boom north of Volant. The drilling continued until the beginning of World War I.

With the Great Depression came a gradual decline of the economy. The mill, which was the prime source of Volant&#x27;s economy, closed its doors in the early 1960s, and the trains stopped running through Volant in 1975.

In 1984 the mill reopened for the first time in over 20 years as a country gift and antique store. Encouraged by its success, other shops were opened on Main Street. There are over 50 shops and restaurants, turning Volant into one of western Pennsylvania&#x27;s tourist attractions.

==Geography==
Volant is located at (41.114489, -80.259463).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

Volant is located on Pennsylvania Route 208, 10 minutes from I-79 and I-80. It has an old-fashioned main street nestled in the hills of western Pennsylvania Amish country.

Wampum had its own school district called Wampum Public Schools from 1914 to 1962. The district also included students from nearby Chewton and, after 1954, New Beaver. Since 1962, children in Wampum proper and Chewton have attended Ellwood City Area School District, which is considered the legal successor to Wampum Public Schools due to state-mandated school consolidation in the 1960s.

Due to a dispute with the former Big Beaver Township School District that had an informal union with Wampum Public Schools but never fully merged with Wampum, children in New Beaver have attended Big Beaver&#x27;s successor Mohawk Area School District since Ellwood City absorbed Wampum Public Schools.

Wampum High School was home to the Wampum Indians. L Butler Hennon coached the team from 1933-1961. The Wampum Indians all-time record stood at 521-126 (.805). The Wampum Indians won the sectional title 16 times, three state championships (1955, 1959, 1960) and a record setting 82 consecutive games between 1953-1959.
