A narrow-gauge railway built in 1882, the Saratoga, Mount McGregor and Lake George Railroad, ran through Wilton.

Throughout the 1990s the town took advantage of its proximity to Saratoga Springs, by expanding suburban and commercial areas. The Wilton Mall is located in the town, as well as many large retail stores off of exit 15 on I-87.

It lies between the historic Cherry Valley Turnpike, also known as the Third Great Western Turnpike (now part of US 20), and another highway once known as the Danforth Turnpike (now New York State Route 7).

Under the name of Delanson, its history dates back only to 1893. The sister hamlet of Quaker Street, situated approximately one-half mile to the south of Delanson and on the Danforth Turnpike (now New York Route 7), was the pioneer business center serving the surrounding territory before the era of railroad transportation. What is now known as Delanson was then referred to as Toad Hollow because it lies to the head of the Normans Kill drainage.

The Albany and Susquehanna Railroad, being authorized and organized by the state legislature to construct a railroad from Albany to Binghamton, built the railroad in sections. The first section extended from Albany to Central Bridge, and their engineers, seeking a favorable grade, found the desired route passed through the upper part of the Normans Kill valley which provided an improved means of transportation for this vicinity. This section was constructed from 1861 to 1863 inclusive, and in the latter year transportation was established between the above-named points. To best serve the needs of Quaker Street, a site was chosen for a station and other necessary facilities. A station and freight house were erected on the east side of the highway crossing, between certain tracks existing at that time. This was given the name Quaker Street Station.

The Delaware and Hudson Canal Company was organized and was expanded by buying or leasing railroads from Rouses Point, New York to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and the canal from Honesdale, Pennsylvania to Rondout, New York. The Albany and Susquehanna Railroad was leased to the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company and became part of its Susquehanna Division. Later, the canal properties were sold to Samuel Coykendall, who dropped the word &quot;canal&quot; from the corporation title. The Schenectady and Duanesburg Railroad was built from Delanson to Schenectady; at Delanson it connected with, and became part of, the Susquehanna division of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad. The formation of a junction brought increased activities to this point, making it necessary for more men to be employed.

Out of necessity, homes were built for the accommodation of those employed in their different capacities by the railroad. Several business places opened up, including a coal business owned and operated by Mr. Hicks Sheldon, who conducted this business until the time of his death, after which it was purchased by Mr. W. C Briggs.

For many years Doctors Hill and Roche of Quaker Street gave medical attention to persons in the territory.

For a few years there was a creamery, but this did not last long and was sold to Charles Washburn, who changed it to a storehouse. On the east side of the railroad tracks a saw mill was built and later expanded to include feed grinding, flour milling, and dealing in lumber supplies, successively owned and operated by A. Ball, Peter Hunt, Charles Washburn, and Briggs and Horohoe.

In keeping with the times two hotels were brought into being for the accommodation of the traveling public; one by James Shoudy and the other later owned by Richard Mackey.

Because of the nature of the employment, the population of the village was largely of the transient type with employees coming here to work for terms of different duration and leaving through advancement, promotion, or the desire to seek other employment due to the proximity of Schenectady with its extensive enterprises. This being the case, there is a considerable lack of accurate records, and this makes it difficult to record in true order the events which contributed to the growth of the village.

During the decade preceding 1890 there was considerable discussion over choosing a name for the settlement. The name &quot;Caryell&quot;, after a man living here, was proposed. C. D. Hammond, who was superintendent of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad, named it Delanson, coining the word from Delaware and Hudson. He took the first three letters of Delaware (Del), the first two of &quot;and&quot; (an), and added the last three letters of the word Hudson (son), making the complete word &quot;Delanson&quot;. Thus the name had changed from Toad Hollow to Quaker Street Station to Delanson.

Because the post office was located at Quaker Street, and feeling the need for more adequate post office facilities, a movement was started to establish a post office at Delanson. Providing the name of the community was the first necessary step in the process of securing a post office. In 1893, a post office was established in the store of one Ed Wilber, which building has continually housed the post office to the date of this compilation. Wilber was appointed acting postmaster in 1893, and was succeeded in December of the same year by Mr. Lorin H. White, Delanson&#x27;s first regularly appointed postmaster.

During the agitation for a name, a post office, and other matters necessary to a new community, the people were not unmindful of their needs for a place in which to worship. The reward of their efforts was the Methodist Episcopal Church, erected in 1877–78, which still stands and adequately serves its purpose. The pastor of this church for many years also presided at the services in the old North Church located at Lee&#x27;s Church, sometimes known as Lee&#x27;s Corners. The parsonage was built in 1886 on the south side of the church.

The last portion of the railroad, Bainbridge to Binghamton, was completed in 1869 and through traffic was established; this resulted in increasing activities to the railroad. Car inspectors were employed; cripple track service for the repair of damaged cars and a roundhouse for the care of locomotives were some of the facilities provided in keeping with the upward trend of business. In 1885, the first station, and hay barn adjoining, burned. Immediately a new station was erected on the present site. Building a new station here necessitated the removal of the first crude method of refueling locomotives, and a turntable, to a new location. The new refueling plant was provided at a point near the present water tanks and served for several years. About 1900, a greatly improved refueling plant was coal storage facilities was built, this served until 1929 when the refueling of engines was discontinued at this point. Although a considerable number of men had found employment in different capacities, a policy of retrenchment was adopted as was general on all railroad due to business conditions, with the result that all of the smaller terminals were eliminated, thus removing this source of employment.

The hotel and restaurant owned and operated by Mr. James Shoudy, located just south of the station burned in June 1891. The restaurant was never rebuilt but Mr. Shoudy immediately started reconstruction of the hotel on the old foundation. This locally supported two blacksmith&#x27;s shops, one of which stood on the site of the present post office building and was later moved to its present location, the other was located east of the highway crossing on the lands of James Shoudy – this was razed in 1933.

Early in the 1880s, a small greenhouse was built under the direction of Mrs. H. W. Harris. To this was added, at different times, four other units as the volume of business expanded. Later, her son assumed ownership and operation of the flourishing business. Since then Mr. Kapper and then Mr. R. P. Hagadorn purchased and operated the greenhouse – after approximately fifty five years of service this was torn down.

The demands for improved water service for both railroad and domestic purposes reached a stage beyond the ability of private means to supply. As a result, the Duanesburg Water Company was incorporated and a reservoir with the necessary means of distribution was installed. The reservoir was located north of the Delanson and just south of the Cherry Valley Turnpike. This construction took place in 1895. Another reservoir was added about 1909.

Surrounding territory supplied the railroad with a considerable amount of business through the shipment of hay, handled by dealers located here at different times. Some of them were D.A. Ball, John Ball, Fox and Terpening, Lauren Webster, R.A. Babcock, Harold Babcock, and Ernest Babcock, who is local representative of Grange League Federation and conducts a feed store.

Delanson&#x27;s first postmaster, L.H. White, also established in 1894 an undertaking and furniture business which he conducted until his death. Mr. Galen White, his son assumed ownership then and has continued the business. Mr. L.H. White further increased his activities by representing this district in the state legislature.

Prior to 1920, there were from time to time serious discussions on fire protection and the question of establishing a fire district or incorporating the village. The first step was to organize a volunteer fire department in 1920. This was followed in 1921 by the incorporation of the village. A small hand-drawn hosecart and chemical apparatus was purchased; later a motorized pumper was bought. Mr. R.A. Babcock was the first president of the village. Under his supervision, and with the aid of a progressive board of trustees, a building was built, to be known as the Village Hall, and with provisions for housing the fire-fighting equipment and headquarters for the fire department. This building, started in 1922, and completed in 1923, contains, besides the above-mentioned features, an auditorium, a room for the Village Board and a fully equipped kitchen.

In 1925, the Fulton County Gas and Electric Company established service in this village, providing street lights and current for domestic use.

Many sources of employment on the railroad were established which caused the removal of many employees from this point. Since that time families have moved here to occupy the homes but many of them are employed elsewhere, principally in Schenectady. This has changed the type of village from commercial to residential.

A number of historic buildings were included in the Delanson Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The Christman Bird and Wildlife Sanctuary was listed in 1970.

<text>Princetown is a town in Schenectady County, New York, United States. The population was 2,024 at the 2020 census. It is in the central part of the county, west of the town of Rotterdam.

== History ==
The town of Princetown was established in 1798 by the New York State Legislature, combining lands formerly known as Corry&#x27;s Bush and land belonging to the Dutch Reformed Church in Schenectady. It was named for John Prince, a New York State assemblyman from Albany County who lived in Schenectady proper at the time. Many of the early settlers of the town were from Scotland, and for almost all of its history, the town has been rural with an economy based in agriculture. Today the town is mostly a mix of farming and exurban development with a little light industry.

In the past, the town had seven one-room schools. It was also home to the Princetown Academy and Female Seminary which opened in 1853 but operated for only three years before succumbing to financial mismanagement. The Academy was sponsored by the local Presbyterian church. In 1854, it had more than 400 students mostly from the local region but also included students from as far away as Cuba, Germany and Scotland. The Academy was located in the former hamlet of Princetown (Center).

In the south end of the town was Cheeseman&#x27;s Tavern (c. 1784) located in the hamlet of Gifford&#x27;s (Corners). Its owner, Joshua Cheeseman, was for a few years, a regionally well-known shinplaster banker, producing a number of paper notes used across the region.

In the north end of the town, on the border with Duanesburg, was the location of the estate of George William Featherstonaugh, which was the subject of several Thomas Cole paintings. Featherstonaugh was an English-American geographer and geologist also especially interested in the use of rail transportation to modernize farming.

A cotton mill in the community of Gilboa was a major contributor to the early economy of the town, but it was destroyed by a flood in 1869.

In 1926, the Schoharie Creek was dammed to form the Schoharie Reservoir. The original settlement of Gilboa was razed and flooded as part of this project. A new settlement was established north of the reservoir.

<text>Sharon Springs is a village in Schoharie County, New York, United States. The population was 558 at the 2010 census. Its name derives from the hometown of the first colonial settlers, Sharon, Connecticut, and the important springs in the village. Sharon Springs, Kansas, likewise was settled by former residents of this upstate New York village.

The village of Sharon Springs sits in the northwest part of Schoharie County in the town of Sharon, approximately west of Albany, the state capital. The city is surrounded by rolling hills and nestled in a winding valley, as well as being near to some of New York State&#x27;s most popular attractions. Howe Caverns is to the south, while The Mohawk River and Erie Canal are to the north. The Adirondack Park is further north, about one hour away, and the Catskill Park is to the south. Cooperstown, home to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, The Farmer&#x27;s Museum and the Fenimore Art Museum, is to the west.

Since the middle-to-late 1980s, Sharon Springs has gained increased local attention and prominence in Schoharie County. Entrepreneurs from outside the region started businesses and restored its structures, prompting regional and New York City media to track the progress. It has gained the attention of Korean spa investors, but their plans are currently unrealized. Sharon Springs was recently featured on a cable reality television series, and provided a backdrop for a memoir. The company Sharon Springs, Inc. has begun work on the baths and allowed for people to book stays online at the village&#x27;s Roseboro Hotel.

== Significance ==
Sharon Springs is recognized by both the National Register of Historic Places as well as New York State&#x27;s Register of Historic Places as a historic spa village. Many of its historic spa-related structures were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994 as the Sharon Springs Historic District. At one time, mineral springs were used for medical treatments and in the summers wealthy families from New York City would travel up to Sharon Springs for the spas. From 1836 to 1860, several large hotels were built in the village, though today they are abandoned. The collection of fully and partially restored 19th century structures and ruins can be accessed year-round.

The most famous of the springs in the Village is the so-called Gardner Spring, which was owned by the owner of the Pavilion Hotel. As reported in the New York Times on August 30, 1875:

Sharon Springs has drawn people to the area because of the Village&#x27;s four different mineral waters and the water&#x27;s healing qualities. The village has sulfur, magnesia, chalybeate and &#x27;Blue Stone&#x27; springs., During the 19th century, Sharon Springs grew into a bustling spa, and at the peak of its popularity, Sharon Springs hosted 10,000 visitors each summer, including members of the Vanderbilt family and Oscar Wilde, who also gave a lecture at the now-demolished Pavilion Hotel on August 11, 1882. Direct ferry-to-stagecoach lines connected New York City to Sharon Springs, followed by rail lines connecting the Village to New York City, as well as to Boston via Albany.

== History ==
Prior to being settled by Great Britain as part of the country&#x27;s Province of New York, Sharon Springs was frequented by the indigenous Iroquois population for its healing waters. After Britain&#x27;s Royal Proclamation of 1763, the Crown formed Tryon County in 1772, which lay at the westernmost reaches of the original Thirteen Colonies. Sharon Springs, then known as the town of New Dorlach, was settled &quot;circa&quot; 1780. Tryon County stretched from the Adirondack Mountains to the Delaware River and boasted a pre-Revolutionary War farming community of 10,000 people, known as the &quot;Breadbasket of the Colonies&quot;.

During the American Revolution, the Town of Sharon participated very little in combat, though it did see some battles. One significant moment was the Battle of Sharon, which was fought on July 10, 1781. Approximately 300 British and Iroquois troops commanded by John Doxtader camped at the Sharon Springs Swamp, near the present-day intersection of Route 20 and County Road 34. The group burned down 12 homes in a small Canajoharie River settlement and claimed victory in the Battle of Currytown on July 9. Colonel Marinus Willett of the American forces headed to their camp with a force of 150 men. Willet attacked the redcoats in the dense swamp, killing 40. Doxtader&#x27;s men fled and Willett claimed The Battle of Sharon as an American victory.

During and after the Revolution, Sharon Springs was part of the town of Schoharie in Tryon County. In 1784, Tryon County was renamed Montgomery County to honor General Richard Montgomery, an American war hero who gave his life trying to capture the city of Quebec. In 1791, Otsego County was broken off from Montgomery County, and in 1795, Schoharie was formed from adjoining parts of Otsego and Albany counties. The town of Sharon was formed shortly after in 1797. 74 years later, Sharon Springs was set apart from the town of Sharon in 1871, when residents incorporated it as a village.

=== Immigration ===
According to an article published in the &quot;New York Times&quot; (August 26, 2000), Sharon Springs lost its fashionable Social Register set to the horse-racing attractions of Saratoga Springs. Wealthy Jewish families of German origin, who were unwelcome at Saratoga due to the prevailing social bias of the time, filled the void and &quot;made Sharon Springs a refuge of their own.&quot; Eventually, these families moved on to other, more modern resorts, and the Village began to fade economically. Other factors that exacerbated the Village&#x27;s early 20th century decline were Prohibition (which reduced the need for the local hop harvest) and the opening of the New York State Thruway (which routed traffic away from the area).

Sharon Springs was also associated with several beer barons in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Most American hops were grown in a belt stretching from Madison to Schoharie Counties in upstate New York. Thus, this area attracted brewers who summered in the area, two of whom, Henry Clausen and Max Shaefer, built homes in the Village. The New York hops trade disappeared after the first world war due to the combined effects of competition from Oregon, a hops blight, and the coming of Prohibition.

From the 1920s to the 1960s, &quot;kuchaleyans&quot; flourished. These were self-catered boarding houses, and in Yiddish the name means &quot;cook-alones.&quot; They were a more affordable alternative to the larger, more expensive hotels and were especially popular during the Depression and, after with poor, post-war refugees from Europe. Though none operated past the 1980s, one of them, &quot;The Brustman House&quot; on Union Street, survives as a retreat for the owners&#x27; descendants. This house&#x27;s story is typical of the &quot;kuchaleyans&quot;.

As the cited New York Times article went on to explain that after World War II, Sharon Springs got a second wind from the West German government, which &quot;paid medical care reparations to Holocaust survivors, holding that therapeutic spa vacations were a legitimate part of the medical package.&quot; In the summer of 1946, one of the busboys at the Spanish Colonial Revival style Adler Hotel was Edward I. Koch, the future mayor of New York City.

The 1970s through the 1990s saw the succession of secular Jewish tourists to Sharon Springs by Hasidim and ultra-Orthodox Jewish visitors, fed in part by a parallel displacement in the nearby Borsht Belt. Their time in Sharon Springs is documented in &quot;The Short Season of Sharon Springs,&quot; published by Cornell University Press in 1980. A host of Hasidim-owned and frequented hotels flourished in the Village, bridging the gap between Sharon Springs&#x27; shining past as a world-class resort for the rich and famous and its recent renascence as a regional travel and weekend destination.

=== Resurgence ===
In the 1970s, concurrent migration of weekend hunters and union trade workers from the Downstate New York City suburbs began coming to Sharon Springs and Schoharie County. As suburban and urban hunters tracked deer in the area, they also introduced the once-endangered wild turkey to this and other rural areas. Unlike the Hasidim tourists, who have mostly moved on to other destinations and have dwindled in number, the first wave of suburban weekenders added to the community by building their families in the Village and relocating their full-time lives to their former part-time escape.

Sharon Springs, after drifting into a rundown state by the late 1980s, has seen resurgence in the 1990s. Much of it can be attributed to both a stabilization of the remaining historic structures (arson leveled many of the abandoned hotels) and an infusion of ambitious buyers from outside the area looking for an affordable community to start a business or to add rural weekends to their city life. The New York Times cites the revival to the &quot;uninterrupted supply of affluent, educated second-homers from New York City (3.5 hours away) and Columbia County (2 hours away)... and the exponential growth of a new travel phenomenon, heritage tourism: the quest for things historic by well-heeled tourists.&quot; Low real estate prices, early renovations, successful start-ups, positive press including back to back &#x27;Escapes&#x27; New York Times articles in 2000, and later post-911 flight from New York City all contributed to an influx of entrepreneurs, artisans and artists.

== Places of interest ==
The restoration of The American Hotel on Main Street was among the first completed projects in Sharon Springs&#x27; rebirth. The structure was collapsing and abandoned when buyers bought it in 1996. The two buyers refurbished the three-story Greek Revival (c. 1847) into a functioning hotel with a full-service restaurant. The guest houses were renovated in 2005

The Klinkhart Building is also across from the American and formerly housed a 300-seat theatre. There are plans to renovate the building and develop a center for the Arts.

One of the grandest structures during the Village&#x27;s Spa heyday is The Roseboro. Two local residents prevented the 150-room Roseboro from being demolished and began a massive restoration process. The restoration was never fully completed, but the Roseboro Hotel could now afford to hold shops. Since 2000, the building operates a functioning restaurant, banquet and retail space. It now houses an antique shop and a Victorian tea room.

=== Local successes and Village enterprise ===
Another Village business is Beekman 1802 Mercantile, which was founded in 2008 by Dr. Brent Ridge and author Josh Kilmer-Purcell with the help of soap craftsman Debbie McGillicuddy. The business has been featured in publications and on &quot;The Martha Stewart Show&quot;. A Planet Green cable network reality television series, &quot;The Fabulous Beekman Boys&quot;, followed the efforts to build a rural business in 2010 and 2011. The show is notable for its cameo appearances by Martha Stewart, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell and other celebrities.

The 177 structures in the Village appear on the National Register of Historic Places as a mineral resort. The Village won a grant from the New York State Council for the Humanities to establish a self-guided walking tour through Sharon Springs in 1997. There are plaques that remain to present day in Main Street that allow guests to take the tour. Because many structures no longer stand today, historic photos and informative text on the plaques help visitors to imagine the town&#x27;s grandeur of a prior time.

The boutique trade in bed and breakfast type inns has allowed the Village to take advantage of the sweeping valley and rolling hill type geography of the community for benefit of the town&#x27;s economy. Several other inns, beds and breakfast, and houses offering rooms for rent currently operate in and near the Village.

Other entrepreneurs who have moved to the Village continue to contribute to its the city&#x27;s growth as word of the area&#x27;s rebirth has spread to neighboring towns, the county, and surrounding regions during the 21st century.

The biggest employer for the Village is a Walmart distribution center, though there is no actual Walmart in town.

During the last 10 years, Sharon Springs has also figured prominently in episodes of The Food Network&#x27;s &quot;$40 A Day&quot; and &quot;Rachael Ray&#x27;s Tasty Travels&quot; series. Charles Kuralt also filmed a brief segment of his &quot;On The Road&quot; series here, tracking a rare bluebird only found on the stretch of Route 20 between Albany and the Town of Sharon.

Sharon Springs provided backdrops for two feature films. The first is the 1951 comedy &quot;The Model and the Marriage Broker&quot;, which features a scene in which Scott, an eligible bachelor, meets up in Sharon Springs with a matchmaker played by Thelma Ritter. The other, more cited movie is 1970&#x27;s horror cult classic, &quot;I Drink Your Blood&quot;; almost all of the scenes were filmed on location in the Village.

A postcard of Sharon Springs is featured in the opening intro of the movie &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;.

==Potential hotel and resort development==

In late 2004, an investment group called, Sharon Springs Inc. (SSI) primarily based in New York City purchased the historic Adler, Columbia, and Washington hotels with the goal of turning Sharon Springs back into a resort destination. The Washington, in poor condition at the time, was partially demolished, and the group expressed their intention to demolish the Hotel Columbia as well. In addition, the group purchased the functioning Imperial Baths which were intended to serve as a key draw to their resort plans.

The properties were acquired for a total of $750,000. The Baths operations were closed at the end of the 2005 season marking the first time since the early 19th century that the village did not have a mineral bath tourist trade. The 150-room Adler Hotel on the northern edge of the village was one of the last hotels built prior to the Great Depression, and was recognized for its Spanish style architecture. The five-story hotel opened in 1927 and closed after the 2004 summer season.

In April 2007 the SSI held a press conference and outlined a $12 million plan to restore both the Imperial Baths and the Adler Hotel in an 18-month project that would bring in a projected 700 visitors a day when completed. Harold Shin, project manager for Manhattan-based architectural firm DeArch LLC, described how the Adler would be restored, and how the Imperial Baths would include both traditional baths and modern spa facilities.

The plans have since changed from restoration of the existing historic hotels into a possible &quot;$350 million plan to erect two 11-story hotels — including one with a helipad — a golf course, condominiums and a spa with a bathhouse and a day care center.&quot; Demolition and work on the properties was planned to start in 2008 according to the principal partner, Q Sung Cho. The timeline for completion would have been between five and seven years once the project began.

=== Delayed plans ===
As of September 2011, no work has commenced on the project and the purchased historic structures are in deteriorating condition. Buildings such as the Adler and Imperial Baths, which were in use recently before the purchase, may now be in need of immediate and emergency stabilization.

In late June 2013, SSI suggested that plans were back on track although they would require approval from the Sharon Springs council. Per SSI partner AidenHan, their attorney and surveyor Joanne Crum brought details of the long-proposed SSI Imperial Baths project to the Sharon Springs Joint Planning Board on June 26. A formal application for the proposed work, which focused solely on the Baths with no mention of the Adler, was not presented. In the Planning Board meeting, Ms. Crum said, &quot;There are three smaller buildings at the site and the remains of a fourth will be removed, but they will be able to salvage the Imperial Baths and gazebo, both of which will be renovated and restored.&quot; 

Sharon Springs Inc. received a $5 million loan from Noah Bank in New Jersey in September 2013, along with the utilization of a $1 million Restore NY grant. The money from these sources went directly towards the razing of the Hotel Washington in mid September and were to help fund roof work on the Adler Hotel. By the end of 2013, a decision was to be made about whether to save or raze the Adler Hotel. Additionally, the funds were to go to the restoring of the Imperial Baths structures.

At the close of 2014, the execution of the proposed plans listed above have still not materialized.

==Spa and resort development reboot==
In May 2015, the often discussed development plans of Sharon Springs Inc., a company owned solely now by Kyu Sung Cho, resurfaced with new renderings and a plan of action. A presentation to the town&#x27;s Joint Planning Board cited the razing of the collapsed Lower Baths and Laundry and Medical Buildings, which were part of the Imperial Baths complex. Additionally, asbestos under the stucco of the Imperial Baths&#x27; façade was to be removed. Long-range plans, dependent on the asbestos removal as well as using NY State Grants, called for demolishing the Columbia Hotel to put a parking lot in its place, and in even longer terms, restoring the Adler Hotel.

The architectural plans for the Imperial Baths called for it to have an Asian theme in the rear but the street side exterior was to closely match the original design. A tour operator hopes to bring visitors from NYC to Sharon Springs as before when the spa was functional.

In November 2024, it was announced that a Japanese hotel management company, Hoshino Resorts, is developing an onsen ryokan (a Japanese style spa and inn) resort in Sharon Springs. The resort is expected to open in 2028.

===New York State Grants===

On January 15, 2008, it was announced that under New York State&#x27;s $100 million Restore NY program, $500,000 was being allocated to Sharon Springs. The grant was intended for the Pavilion Cottages, which are not related to the Adler Hotel/Korean spa projects. The Pavilion Cottages, built in the 1860s, are the last remaining portion of the historic Pavilion Hotel. The one remaining structure of the Pavilion Cottages was originally accompanied by three other Cottages which offered private suites for families traveling with servants in tow. In 2010, due to missed project deadlines, the matching grant was unfortunately allowed to lapse unused.

On September 2, 2009, Restore New York / Empire State Development&#x27;s Communities Initiative - Round 3 - announced they were granting $1,000,000 for creation of The Imperial Spa by Sharon Springs Inc. Per the Empire State Development press release: &quot;The rehabilitation will create spa and therapy areas of&quot; and &quot;for outdoor bathing facilities. The total renovated square footage, including amenities such as restaurants and gift shops, will be&quot; . The project funding was anticipated to create 100 new jobs in the community and aimed to rehabilitate the historic Imperial Bathhouse (circa 1927) into a modern luxury spa, as well as re-establish Sharon Springs as a spa destination in New York.

However, the group&#x27;s standstill on the project leaves the potential restoration of the Imperial Baths uncertain. In the meantime, the historic bathhouses continue to deteriorate.

<text>Catharine is a town in Schuyler County, New York, United States. The population was 1,656 at the 2020 census. The town is one of two in the county named after Catherine Montour, a Native American interpreter and leader in the area. The Town of Catharine is in the southeastern part of the county and is north of Elmira.

==History==
A Seneca village informally known as Catharine&#x27;s Town was located near the falls. It was destroyed by colonial forces during the Sullivan Expedition of 1779, one of more than 40 villages destroyed across western New York in retaliation for raids in the eastern part of the province.

The first European-American settlers are thought to have arrived around 1788 after the American Revolutionary War. The Seneca and other Iroquois allies of the British were forced to cede their lands in New York. The Town of Catharine was created by the New York State Legislature in 1798, with its first elections occurring in the same year. By 1805 the town had grown sufficiently that a Methodist congregation was formed in the eponymous hamlet of Catharine. An Episcopalian congregation was the first to build a church, St. John&#x27;s, in 1811.

The town was originally organized as part of Chemung County, before the formation of Schuyler County. Property for Catharine was taken from the Town of Elmira (then called &quot;Newtown&quot;) in 1798. Part of Catharine was in turn divided to form the Towns of Veteran and Catlin (both in Chemung County) in 1825. Catharine was further reduced by the formation of the Town of Montour in 1857. When Schuyler County was established in 1854, Catharine was removed from the remit of Chemung County.

The Lattin-Crandall Octagon Barn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (1.82%) is water.

<doc id="127154" wikidata="Q770546" url="?curid=127154" title="Fetish fashion">
<text>Fetish fashion is any style or appearance in the form of a type of clothing or accessory, created to be extreme, revealing, skimpy, or provocative in a fetishistic manner. By definition, most people do not wear these styles; if everyone wears an item, it cannot have a fetishistic, special nature. They are usually made of materials such as leather, latex or synthetic rubber or plastic, nylon, PVC, spandex, fishnet, and stainless steel. Some fetish fashion items include: stiletto heel shoes and boots (most notably the ballet boot), hobble skirts, corsets, collars, full-body latex catsuits, stockings, miniskirt, crotchless underwear, jockstraps, diapers, garters, locks, rings, zippers, eyewear, handcuffs, and stylized costumes based on more traditional outfits, such as wedding dresses that are almost completely see-through lace, or lingerie for men.

Fetish fashions should not be confused with costuming. They both involve clothing and intend to present an image, but a costume is, by definition, something for public view without sexual implications. Fetish fashion is usually for an intimate setting, with sexual implications.

Fetish fashions are usually considered to be separate from those clothing items used in cosplay, whereby these exotic fashions are specifically used as costuming to effect a certain situation rather than to be merely worn, such as the creation of a character for picture play. However, sometimes the two areas do overlap. For example, in Japan, some themed restaurants have waitresses who wear costumes such as a suit made of latex or a stylized French maid or Playboy bunny outfit.

Specialist fetish models often model fashionable clothing.

Some types of garments that women wear to routinely improve their appearance are thought of as erotic and qualify as fetish wear: corsets and high heels. Most fetish wear is not practical enough for routine daily wear. An example of a fetish costume worn by women is the dominatrix costume. This costume typically consists of dark or black garments, including a corset or bustier, stockings, and high-heeled footwear such as thigh-high boots to enhance the dominating appearance. An accessory such as a whip or a riding crop is often carried.

==History==
Fetish fashion has no specific origin point because certain fashions appreciated specifically for themselves or worn as part of a specific subculture have been noted since the earliest days of clothing. Some scholars, like Michael Hayworth, argue that the use of corsetry and hobble skirts back in the late 19th century was the first mainstream note of fetish fashions because the majority of society did not have access to these articles. These items were specifically appreciated for themselves (i.e. the person liked the woman wearing the corset rather than just the woman by herself).

In 1914 a few weeks before World War One, L. Richard and his wife Nativa founded their lingerie firm, Yva Richard, in Paris. Their custom made unique creations became increasingly daring and avant-garde, and by the late 1920s, they had highly successful international mail-order business. Richard took most of the photographs for their catalogue, and Nativa would sometimes model. One of their most iconic designs was a studded steel cone bra and chastity belt with a plumed headdress. Their success encouraged the tailor Léon Vidal, who owned a chain of erotic bookshops, to open a luxurious lingerie boutique called Diana Slip.

A leather subculture appeared amongst the underground gay community in the United States, with the first gay leather bar opening in 1958 in Chicago. This culture quickly spread worldwide, and became more mainstream in the 1960s due to the influence of rock musicians and television performers such as Diana Rigg and Honor Blackman in &quot;The Avengers&quot;, who wore full body leather catsuits and full limb-covering leather and latex gloves and boots.

Many fashion designers incorporate elements of the fetish subculture into their creations or directly create products based on elements that the mainstream does not accept. Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood created several restrictive BDSM-inspired clothing items of punk fashion for the 1970s punk subculture; in particular bondage trousers, which connect the wearer&#x27;s legs with straps. The more recent fetish clothing makers House of Harlot and Torture Garden Clothing, Breathless of London, Vex Latex Clothing, and Madame S of California focus on using latex and leather as the base material for their creations, rather than as an accessory.

==Publications==
Fetish fashions became popularized in the United States during the 1950s through books and magazines such as &quot;Bizarre&quot; and many other underground publications. &quot;Skin Two&quot; is a contemporary fetish magazine covering many aspects of the worldwide fetish subculture. The name is a reference to fetish clothing as a second skin.

== Mainstream ==
Fetish fashion has influenced mainstream fashion, both on and off the runway. Many well-known designers have used fetish wear as an inspiration, borrowing details and incorporating materials such as latex, PVC, lace, vinyl and patent leather. Such designers include Thierry Mugler, Jonathan Saunders, Alexander McQueen, Christian Dior, Chanel and Nicholas Kirkwood. The Alexander McQueen Autumn/Winter 2016 ready-to-wear collection was influenced by fetish fashion, and the inspiration for materials and pieces such as harnesses and corsets can be seen in most of the looks.

Other brands have been created specifically for the fetish clothing luxury market. Fleet Ilya, headed by the husband and wife team Ilya Fleet and Resha Sharma, began promoting the co-existence of fashion and BDSM as a symbiotic concept. Early adaptation of their leather harnesses by Sienna Miller in 2006 and Rihanna in 2009 led to an Autumn/Winter 2009 eponymous collection that featured fashion pieces and bondage tools alike. &quot;The Restraint by Fleet Ilya&quot; exhibition and pop-up shop in collaboration with Rankin followed in 2010. Subsequent collaborations with mainstream brands include Comme des Garçons, Jonathan Saunders and Dion Lee, establishing Fleet Ilya&#x27;s dedication to blurring the lines between high fashion and fetish wear. Zana Bayne, a post-fetish leather brand based in New York City was founded by Zana Bayne in 2010. Their work has been worn by celebrities such as Beyoncé and Lady Gaga. Zana Bayne has also collaborated with other brands such as Marc Jacobs and Comme des Garçons. Todd Pendu began working with Zana Bayne when he was at Comme des Garçons before becoming a full-time creative partner at Zana Bayne in 2012. Atsuko Kudo is another brand explicitly influenced by fetish fashion, who design and manufacture ladies wear made entirely in latex rubber.

Street fashion has also been influenced by fetish fashion. By late 2016 and through 2017, some fetish fashion elements had appeared in ready-to-wear and streetwear around the world. These elements include items such as chokers, fishnets, corsets, and thigh-high boots; details such as straps, buckles, pierced ring hardware, and chains; and materials like patent leather and vinyl.

<text>Montour Falls is a village located in Schuyler County, New York, United States. The population was 2,714 at the time of the 2020 census. A waterfall at the end of West Main Street gives the village its name. The name &quot;Montour&quot; is derived from Queen Catharine Montour, a prominent Native American woman of Seneca Indian heritage who lived at the village site in the 18th century.

The boundaries defining the Village of Montour Falls occur mostly within the Town of Montour, but a small part lies within the Town of Dix. The village is located approximately twenty miles north of Elmira, New York and three miles south of Watkins Glen, New York. The New York State Academy of Fire Science is located in the village.

==History==
The modern day Village of Montour Falls is developed on the site of a former Seneca Indian village, Queanettquaga, informally known as Catherine&#x27;s Town after a prominent Seneca Indian resident and leader, Queen Catharine Montour. Queen Catharine Montour&#x27;s father (Peter Quebec) was a Mohawk Chief, and her mother (Margaret Montour Hunter) the daughter of an Oneida Chief. She would marry Seneca Indian Chief Thomas Htitson. Queen Catharine Montour&#x27;s Seneca Tribe was a member of the Iroquois Confederacy. During America&#x27;s War of Independence reprisals were sanctioned against tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy who had allied themselves with Great Britain. The infamous nearby Battle of Newtown, New York (August 1779) and the march that devastated Queanettquaga (and forty other Amerindian villages of the Finger Lakes) is known as the Sullivan-Clinton Expedition. In addition to burning Queen Catharine Montour&#x27;s log palace, orchards were cut down, homes destroyed, livestock murdered and cropland salted. Residents of Catharine&#x27;s Town dispersed to areas as far away as Niagara and Canada. Queen Catharine Montour (b. 1710, died February 20, 1804) is memorialized by a grave mound located on her namesake Catharine Trail within the Montour Falls village limits.

By 1788 the area began to be settled by European Americans. In 1805 the area was known as Mill&#x27;s Landing after local resident George Mills. (The nearby village of Millport, to current times, is also named for George Mills). 1802 is the earliest date commonly used to mark the beginning of the Montour Falls community — it is the year George Mills was appointed postmaster. It is estimated the community of 1802 consisted of twenty residents – and no stores.

Beginning in 1827 and completed in 1833, the Chemung Canal was built through Mills Landing to connect the Chemung River and its watershed to Seneca Lake. Mills Landing, later Havana, would become commercially significant given its location at the head of navigation on the Seneca Lake inlet. At the north end of the lake, another canal connected to the Erie Canal, leading both to the Great Lakes and to the Hudson River and port of New York City, to increase trade and commerce in the region. The village remained unincorporated until May 13, 1836, when it officially adopted a new name to become Havana, New York. The village of Havana was designated the first county seat of newly formed Schuyler County in 1854. By 1861 the county seat would be moved to Watkins Glen.

The current name of Montour Falls was adopted for the village on March 20, 1895. The Town of Montour is also named after the 18th-century Native American Seneca tribe matriarch, Catharine Montour.

From 1850 to 1888 the area&#x27;s Havana pottery stoneware manufacturing community comprised six firms: Savage, Parsons &amp; Co., Savage &amp; Rogers, Brewer &amp; Halm, S. T. Brewer, H. M. Whitman, J. M. Whitman and A. O. Whittemore.

Charles Cook, businessmen, politician (Canal Commissioner and State Senator), philanthropist and visionary, is credited with the establishment of Schuyler County (1854) and Havana, New York as its first County Seat; the Cook Academy (originally the People&#x27;s College) began construction in 1858. Today the same facility is home to the New York State Academy of Fire Science. Cook also served as president of the Chemung Canal Trust Bank—the oldest continuously operating bank in the region dating to 1835. On November 20, 1886, a tribute service held at Cook Academy was attended by Governor David Hill and more than 1,000 citizens, associates and admirers of Cook. A bust of Charles Cook was dedicated at the tribute service. Charles Cook never married.

In 1872 two native son engineers of Havana, New York, formed a materials handling company they called Shepard Niles. In 1902 they built their first heavy duty crane and sold it around the world. The company is still in business today. From their web site: &quot;Workhorse cranes and hoists that last virtually forever–this is what industry expects from Shepard Niles. Our custom hand-built, heavy-duty Class D and E cranes and hoists helped America become the world&#x27;s leading industrial nation, and powered our country through two World Wars.&quot; While the company is ongoing, since its acquisition in 1989, its primary operations are no longer domiciled in Montour Falls.

In 1934 the National Bank of Montour Falls is listed in the Federal Reserve Bank roster Second District. The National Bank of Montour Falls (also 1934) is the issuing bank on a US $10.00 (ten-dollar) Federal Reserve note.

Montour Falls is well known for the natural attraction of a 165-foot waterfall located on the west side of the village. At the base of the falls is a sign labeled &quot;She-qua-ga&quot;, a transliteration of its Seneca name. A bridge above the waterfall spells the name as &quot;Che-qua-ga&quot;. Many historic names have been recorded under a wide variety of spellings, especially as various peoples tried to transliterate them from one language to another. This attraction is also known as &quot;Montour Falls&quot;.

The Brick Tavern Stand, Montour Falls Historic District, and Montour Falls Union Grammar School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Notable events and attractions ==
=== Watkins Glen State Park ===

Watkins Glen State Park is a 778-acre park with a 400-foot-deep (120 m) narrow gorge featuring 19 waterfalls throughout less than two miles. It is considered a &quot;flagship&quot; park by the State of New York.

=== Auto racing at Watkins Glen ===
Watkins Glen is noted for its role in auto racing, being the home of a street course used in road racing, a famous racetrack, Watkins Glen International, one of the premier automobile road racing tracks in the United States, which has hosted the NASCAR Cup Series Go Bowling at The Glen, IndyCar Series Grand Prix at The Glen, and the IMSA SportsCar Championship 6 Hours of Watkins Glen. The first Watkins Glen Sports Car Grand Prix was held in 1948 on public streets in and near the village. Organized by resident Cameron Argetsinger, it was the first post-WWII road race held in the United States and it marked the revival of American road racing.

The original course ran for and passed through the center of the village. The streets used for the original course remain intact today and a checkered flag marks the original start-finish line on the village&#x27;s main street. During the 1952 race, driver Fred Wacker struck onlookers sitting on a curb on a corner coming down West 4th St. (State Route 409), killing a 7-year-old boy and injuring 10 others. The tragedy caused the end of street racing at the Glen and elsewhere in the United States.

A permanent racing facility, the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course opened in 1956. It has hosted nearly every type of road racing, from the Sahlen&#x27;s 6 Hours of Watkins Glen (1948-current), the Formula One United States Grand Prix (1961–1980), and the I Love New York 355 at The Glen (1957-current), which was one of the few races on the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series schedule not conducted on an oval speedway, the other being Sonoma Raceway until NASCAR added more road courses to the Cup Series schedule.

=== International Motor Racing Research Center ===

The International Motor Racing Research Center, a professional archive of motorsports history, opened in June 1999 in an annex of the Watkins Glen Public Library. The mission of the center is to preserve and share the history of motorsports around the world.

=== Personal Watercraft racing at Watkins Glen ===
Since 2014, Watkins Glen has hosted a weekend of IJSBA (International Jet Sports Boating Association) closed course racing, and has become one of the largest race venues in the sport today. Originally promoted in Region 8 by NEWA (North East Watercraft Alliance), until 2016 when East Coast Watercross purchased the series, racing has been in Seneca Lake, near Clute Memorial Park and Campground and is typically the last weekend in August. The event has always been free to spectators and features both closed course racing and freestyle competition using standup, sit-down, and sport class machines.

=== 1973 Summer Jam at Watkins Glen Rock Festival ===
The racetrack was also the scene of the July 28, 1973, Summer Jam at Watkins Glen rock festival attended by an estimated 600,000 people, one-and-a-half times the crowd at 1969&#x27;s historic Woodstock Festival and a world record for the largest number of people at a pop music festival. The concert featured The Allman Brothers Band, Grateful Dead, and The Band. The music started at noon on Saturday and continued long into Sunday.

=== Phish festivals ===
On July 1–3 of 2011, the band Phish hosted Superball IX, a three-day music festival on the same grounds as the Summer Jam of &#x27;73. On August 21–23 2015, Phish hosted their 10th festival, Magnaball, on the grounds. Phish planned to return to Watkins Glen for their 11th festival, Curveball, on August 17–19, 2018 but was forced to cancel when their permit was revoked due to floods contaminating the local water supply.

=== &quot;True Love&quot; schooner ===
Watkins Glen is the home port for &quot;True Love&quot;, a schooner built in 1926 that was featured in &quot;High Society&quot; (1956).

=== Farm animal protection movement ===
Watkins Glen is the home of Farm Sanctuary, a national farm animal protection organization co-founded by activist Gene Baur in 1986. In 1991, the organization opened a shelter in Watkins Glen that has since provided lifelong care for thousands of animals rescued from abuse; hosted numerous public events; and welcomed thousands of visitors from all over the world, sharing with them views of militant vegetarianism.

Seneca was part of the Central New York Military Tract and was first settled around 1790.

The town was established from part of the Town of Romulus in 1800 as the &quot;Town of Washington&quot;, but adopted the current name in 1808.

In Fayette on April 6, 1830, Joseph Smith, who was from nearby Palmyra, New York, organized the Church of Christ in a log home owned by Peter Whitmer Sr. Whitmer and four others besides Smith were the initial six members of the Latter Day Saint movement started by Smith, with the largest denomination in the movement later being known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

In 1980, this reconstructed log home, built on the site of the original Whitmer home, was dedicated as part of the LDS Church&#x27;s sesquicentennial celebrations. The home was dedicated by LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball and was broadcast by satellite, as part of the church&#x27;s semi-annual church general conference, to many LDS stake centers around the world. The Whitmer log home continues to be operated as a religious historical site by the LDS Church.

The Christ Evangelical and Reformed Church and William Hoster House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Rose Hill Mansion is a National Historic Landmark.

<text>Interlaken is a village in Seneca County, New York, United States. The population was 602 at the 2010 census. The name is related to the village&#x27;s position between two lakes.

The Village of Interlaken is in the northern part of the Town of Covert and is northwest of Ithaca, New York.

==History==
The first European or White settlers settled the area in the late 1790s and early 1800s. The Village of Interlaken was home to many families from the New England and New Jersey areas. Early businesses included hotels, blacksmiths, post office, bank, and in time the railroad station. All designed to support the local families and the farmers from the surrounding area.

Four churches were established to serve the community, Union Baptist in 1819, Reformed Church of Farmerville in 1830, a Universalist church in 1850 and St. Francis Solanus Catholic Church in 1874. The First Baptist Church of Interlaken was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

Originally called Farmerville, then Farmer, and Farmer Village the hamlet continued to grow. Prosperous homes were built on Main Street, Lodi Street (now West Avenue), and along the side streets. LeRoy, Lake View, Clinton and Knight Streets were the last to be added.

In 1904 two events occurred in close proximity. With the increase in summer travelers coming to the area on the Lehigh Valley Railroad there was a movement to rename the railroad depot something more than Farmer. The Railroad sponsored a contest to suggest names for the station and a school teacher, Miss Georgiana Wheeler, suggested the name of Interlaken based on her travels to Switzerland. The residents of the village were also working to establish the community as an incorporated village. Several names were suggested and votes taken. In a spirit of unity the Farmer Review encouraged the members of the village to unite behind the name Interlaken. On March 2, 1904, the Village was incorporated, and the following Saturday the Interlaken Review replaced the Farmer Review.

The look of Main Street changed over the years with major fires in December 1880 when much of the south end of business Main Street burned; in February 1891 when the Gambee House burned, it would be replaced with the Goodman House; in April 1926 when the warehouse at the corner of Orchard and Main burned and when the Robinson Hotel burned in February 1939.

Many businesses remain in and near the Village, continuing the tradition of serving the needs of the community and surrounding area.

<doc id="127168" wikidata="Q2423086" url="?curid=127168" title="Punk fashion">
<text>Punk fashion is the clothing, hairstyles, cosmetics, jewellery, and body modifications of the punk counterculture. Punk fashion varies widely, ranging from Vivienne Westwood designs to styles modeled on bands like The Exploited to the dressed-down look of North American hardcore. The distinct social dress of other subcultures and art movements, including glam rock, skinheads, greasers, and mods have influenced punk fashion. Punk fashion has likewise influenced the styles of these groups, as well as those of popular culture. Many punks use clothing as a way of making a statement.

The early, pre-fame work of designer Vivienne Westwood helped pioneer the look of early British punk with her scene-establishing clothing shops Sex and Seditionaries in the mid-1970s, co-run with Malcolm McLaren who managed the Sex Pistols. Westwood was asked by then-partner McLaren to outfit the Sex Pistols, and Westwood&#x27;s designs found a canvas on Johnny Rotten and Sid Vicious. Her early work with Sex and the Sex Pistols helped to establish her as one of the most influential British designers of the 20th century.

Punk fashion has long been commercialized, with well-established fashion designers like Zandra Rhodes, Thierry Mugler, Jean Paul Gaultier, Stephen Sprouse, and Anna Sui using punk elements in their production and the first punk-influenced fashion spreads appearing in mainstream fashion magazines as early as 1976. 

==History==
===1970s===

Punk rock was an intentional rebuttal of the perceived excess and pretension found in mainstream music (or even mainstream culture as a whole), and early punk artists&#x27; fashion was defiantly anti-materialistic. Bands that had been at the forefront of the wave of rebellion, like the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, had become &#x27;respectable&#x27;, having achieved worldwide renown and subsequent wealth. Arena rock groups of the early 70&#x27;s, with long, drawn out songs rooted in the psychedelic movement, were viewed as out-of-touch by fans who were much less economically successful. A desire for music to reflect their values of dissatisfaction and alienation began to develop. Generally unkempt, often short hairstyles replaced the long-hair hippie look and the usually elaborate 1970s rock and disco styles. In the United States, dirty, simple clothesranging from the T-shirt/jeans/leather jacket Ramones look to the low-class, second-hand &quot;dress&quot; clothes of acts like Television or Patti Smithwere preferred over the expensive or colorful clothing popular in the disco scene. With her designs for The Rocky Horror Show and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Sue Blane is credited with creating the look that became the template for punk rock fashion.

In the United Kingdom, 1970s punk fashion influenced the designs of Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren and the Bromley Contingent. Mainstream punk style was influenced by clothes sold in Malcolm McLaren&#x27;s shop, &quot;artdesigncafe&quot;. McLaren has credited this style to his first impressions of Richard Hell, while McLaren was in New York City working with New York Dolls. Hell is credited as one of the first to help popularize the stereotypical &#x27;punk&#x27; look, spiking his hair and wearing t-shirts that were held together with safety pins. Punk fashion aimed to provoke and challenge middle class culture, often through vulgarity, illicit iconography, and sexual innuendos, among other means. Deliberately offensive T-shirts were popular in the early punk scene, such as the &quot;DESTROY&quot; T-shirt sold at SEX, which featured an inverted crucifix and a Nazi Swastika. Another offensive T-shirt that is still occasionally seen in punk is called &quot;Snow White and the Sir Punks&quot;, and features Snow White being held down and raped by five of the seven dwarfs, whilst the other two engage in anal sex. The image&#x27;s origin is as part of &quot;The Realist&quot; magazine&#x27;s Disneyland Memorial Orgy poster in May 1967, although the T-shirts made the scene more explicit. These T-shirts, like other punk clothing items, were often torn on purpose. Other items in early British punk fashion included: leather jackets; customised blazers; and dress shirts randomly covered in slogans (such as &quot;Only Anarchists are pretty&quot;), blood, patches and controversial images.

British punks also used fashion as a means to criticize the monarchy; Westwood&#x27;s &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; shirt featured an image of Queen Elizabeth II alongside text reading &quot;She ain&#x27;t no human being&quot;, taken directly from the Sex Pistol&#x27;s single of the same name. While the band has denied that the single was produced specifically in reaction to the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee, the song and Westwood&#x27;s design were viewed as an affront to British values of patriotism and the monarchy. 

Many early punks wore swastikas and used Nazi imagery in their dress. As a means to provoke people, the symbol retained great power to alarm. Key examples of punk usage of Nazi symbols can be identified in Westwood&#x27;s &quot;DESTROY&quot; t-shirt which was worn by members of the Sex Pistols, or a dress shirt which featured striping similar to those on the uniforms worn by prisoners in concentration camps. Sid Vicious wore a t-shirt featuring a swastika while he walked through a Jewish neighbourhood in the film &quot;The Great Rock and Roll Swindle.&quot; With the resurgence of Britain&#x27;s National Front, those who wore the swastika discredited the anti-racist values of the movement.

Other accoutrements worn by some punks included: BDSM fashions, fishnet stockings (sometimes ripped), spike bands and other studded or spiked jewelry, safety pins (in clothes and as body piercings), silver bracelets and heavy eyeliner worn by both men and women. Many female punks rebelled against the stereotypical image of a woman by combining clothes that were delicate or pretty with clothes that were considered masculine, such as combining a Ballet tutu with big, clunky boots. Female exemplars of early punk style included Pamela Rooke aka Jordan, Siouxsie Sioux, Soo Catwoman, and Gaye Advert.

Punk clothing sometimes incorporated everyday objects for aesthetic effect. Many outfits were made out pieces of clothing that were readily available, either from secondhand stores or whatever kids had on hand. Emphasizing a DIY ethos, many punks utilized jean and leather jackets as canvases for pins, paint, and spikes. Purposely ripped clothes were held together by safety pins or wrapped with tape; black bin liners (garbage bags) became dresses, shirts and skirts. Mohair, PVC, and other odd, anachronistic elements of fashion were utilized in outfits. Other items added to clothing or as jewellery included razor blades and chains. Leather, rubber and vinyl clothing have been common, possibly due to their connection with transgressive sexual practices, such as bondage and S&amp;M. Provocative imagery referencing sexual practices and deviant forms of sexuality were utilized, such as in Vivienne Westwood&#x27;s &quot;Two Cowboys&quot; shirt, which featured an illustration by Jim French of two cowboys naked from the waist down, one of them fixing the other&#x27;s neckerchief. Its depiction of homosexuality was provocative within a middle-class British culture that was hostile to sexual relations alternate to heterosexuality.

Preferred footwear included military boots, motorcycle boots, brothel creepers, Puma Clydes (suede), Chuck Taylor All-Stars and later, Dr. Martens boots. Tapered jeans, tight leather pants, trousers with leopard patterns and bondage pants were popular choices. Other early punks (most notably The Adicts) imitated the Droogs from A Clockwork Orange by wearing bowler hats and braces. Hair was cropped and deliberately made to look messy, and was often dyed bright unnatural colours. Although provocative, these hairstyles were not as extreme as later punk hairstyle.

Keen designers, much like Westwood, had been able to draw inspiration from the punk style found on the streets, translating its anarchic frustration and resistance to the runways. Zandra Rhodes utilized rips, tears and safety pins in her 1977 &#x27;Conceptual Chic&#x27; collection; similarly, Claude Montana presented 12 models in &quot;black leather jackets, caps, and pants in 1977. As it gained popularity on the runway, many designers viewed its origin on the streets as &#x27;trashy&#x27; and that it no longer served as a source of fresh inspiration. Fashion designers ended up creating a standardized palette where the punk look was, more or less, essentially uniform. Spiky hair, jeans or bondage trousers, leather jackets with slogans, pins, and patches on them, T-shirts, studs and chains all became hallmarks of the look, undermining the individuality that had been essential to the movement.

===1980s===

In the 1980s, new fashion styles developed as parallel resurgences occurred in the United States and United Kingdom. What many recognize as typical punk fashions today emerged from the 1980s British scene, when punk underwent its Oi!/street punk, and UK82 renaissance. The US scene was exemplified by hardcore bands such as Black Flag, Minor Threat, and Fear. The 1980s American scene spawned a utilitarian anti-fashion that was nonetheless raw, angry, and intimidating. However, elements of the 1970s punk look never fully died away.

Some of the following clothing items were common on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and some were unique to certain geographic areas. Footwear that was common in the 1980s punk scene included Dr. Martens boots, motorcycle boots and combat boots; sometimes adorned with bandanas, chains or studded leather bands. Jeans (sometimes dirty, torn or splattered with bleach) and tartan kilts or skirts were commonly worn. Leather skirts became a popular item for female punks. Heavy chains were sometimes used as belts. Bullet belts, and studded belts (sometimes more than one worn at a time) also became common.

Some punks bought T-shirts or plaid flannel shirts and wrote political slogans, band names or other punk-related phrases on them with marker pens. While this was not without precedent in the 1970s, the depth and detail of these slogans were not fully developed until the 1980s. Silkscreened T-shirts with band logos or other punk-related logos or slogans were also popular. Studded, painted and otherwise customised leather jackets or denim vests became more popular during this era, as the popularity of the earlier customized blazers waned, somewhat.

Hair was either shaved, spiked or in a crew cut or Mohawk hairstyle. Tall mohawks and spiked hair, either bleached or in bright colors, took on a more extreme character than in the 1970s. &quot;Charged&quot; hair, in which all of one&#x27;s hair stands on end but is not styled into distinct spikes, also emerged. A hairstyle similar to The Misfits&#x27; devilocks was popular. This involved cutting a mohawk but leaving a longer tuft of hair at the front of the head. It is still popular to this day in the Horror-Punk scene. Body piercings and extensive tattoos became very popular during this era, as did spike bands and studded in chokers. Some hardcore punk women reacted to the earlier 1970s movement&#x27;s vibe by adopting an androgynous style.

Hardcore punk fans adopted a &quot;dressed-down&quot; style of T-shirts, jeans, combat boots or sneakers and crewcut-style haircuts. Women in the hardcore scene typically wore army pants, band T-shirts, and hooded sweatshirts.

The style of the 1980s hardcore scene contrasted with the more provocative fashion styles of late 1970s punk rockers (elaborate hairdos, torn clothes, patches, safety pins, studs, spikes, etc.). Circle Jerks frontman Keith Morris described early hardcore fashion as &quot;the...punk scene was basically based on English fashion. But we had nothing to do with that. Black Flag and the Circle Jerks were so far from that. We looked like the kid who worked at the gas station or submarine shop.&quot; Henry Rollins echoes Morris&#x27; point, stating that for him getting dressed up meant putting on a black shirt and some dark pants; Rollins viewed an interest in fashion as being a distraction.

Jimmy Gestapo from Murphy&#x27;s Law describes his own transition from dressing in a punk style (spiked hair and a bondage belt) to adopting a hardcore style (shaved head and boots) as being based on needing more functional clothing. A scholarly source states that &quot;hardcore kids do not look like punks&quot;, since hardcore scene members wore basic clothing and short haircuts, in contrast to the &quot;embellished leather jackets and pants&quot; worn in the punk scene. In contrast to Morris&#x27; and Rollins&#x27; views, one scholarly source claims that the standard hardcore punk clothing and styles included torn jeans, leather jackets, spiked armbands and dog collars and mohawk hairstyles and DIY ornamentation of clothes with studs, painted band names, political statements, and patches. Another scholarly source describes the look that was common in the San Francisco hardcore scene as consisting of biker-style leather jackets, chains, studded wristbands, pierced noses and multiple piercings, painted or tattooed statements (e.g. an anarchy symbol) and hairstyles ranging from military-style haircuts dyed black or blonde, mohawks, and shaved heads.

==Different styles==
Various factions of the punk subculture have different fashion styles, although there is often crossover between the subgroups. The following are descriptions of some of the most common punk styles, categorized alphabetically.

===Anarcho-punk===

Anarcho-punk fashion usually features all-black militaristic clothing, a style that was pioneered by the English punk band Crass. A prominent feature is the heavy use of anarchist symbols and slogans on clothing items. Some who define themselves as anarcho-punks opt to wear clothing similar to traditional punk fashions or that of crust punks, but not often to the extreme of either subculture. Mohawk hairstyles and liberty spikes are seen. Tight trousers, bands T-shirts and boots are common. Hairstyling products often are used only if the company that manufactures it did not test them on animals. Leather often avoided due to veganism, may be replaced with imitation leather or cloth in a similar design as leather products.

===Celtic punk===
Fans of Celtic punk often mix hardcore, street punk, Oi! and skinhead fashions with traditional Irish or Scottish clothing styles, including elements of highland dress. Common items include boots, sneakers, jeans, work trousers, kilts, grandfather shirts, T-shirts, hoodies, braces, black leather jackets, peacoats, donkey jackets, football shirts, flat caps, tuques, Tam O&#x27;Shanter caps and Trilby hats. Hair is usually cut relatively short.

===Cowpunk===

The cowpunk clothing style is a stereotypical U.S. rural, working class, western wear form of dress. Cowpunks may wear anything from a vintage western wear look, including checked shirts, bib overalls, worn jeans, and cowboy boots, to a more industrial look with wifebeater shirts, trucker hats, and work boots. Women&#x27;s hair follows no single style, but men can have anything from a crew cut to long hair, or the exaggerated quiff pompadour hairstyle. Facial hair is also common.

===Crust punk===
Crust punk can be traced back to Bristol (UK). In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Bristol bands like Disorder, Chaos UK, Lunatic Fringe, Amebix, broke from the usual punk fashion confines, creating a disheveled DIY look originating in squatting and poverty. Typical crust punk fashion includes black or camouflage trousers or shorts (heavy work pants are popular for their durability), torn band T-shirts or hoodies, skin tight black jeans, vests and jackets (commonly black denim), bullet belts, jewellery made from hemp or found objects, and sometimes bum flaps. Many items of clothing are covered in patches and/or metal studs. Often, the patches display a political message. Clothing tends to be unsanitary by conventional standards, and dreadlocks are popular.

Crust punks sometimes sew articles of clothing with found or cheaply bought materials, such as dental floss. Pants are sometimes held up with string, hemp, or vegan-friendly imitation leather. This fashion has also been used by Folk Punk fans and musicians, notably Days N Daze, Blackbird Raum, and The Psalters.

===Dance-punk===
Dance-punk fashions include day-glo colors, phat pants, glowsticks, leather studded jackets, chains and combat boots. Typical haircuts include spiky hair bleached blond, short mohawks and synthetic dreadlocks.

===Dark cabaret and Gypsy punk===
Fans of dark cabaret and Gypsy punk often imitate the costumes of 1920s music hall, sideshow or burlesque performers, pejoratively referred to by some modern critics as &quot;once fashionable trash.&quot; Women such as Amanda Palmer of the Dresden Dolls sometimes combine fetish wear such as garter belts, fishnet stockings or corsets with dress clothing, such as a top hat and tailcoat, or traditional Romani dress such as shawls, hoop earrings or colorful skirts. Men often wear vintage Bowler hats, battered fedoras, tweed cloth vests with more typical street punk fashions such as drainpipe trousers or heavy boots. Some artists, including Martyn Jacques of the Tiger Lillies, wear white makeup inspired by French mime artists and the Emcee from Cabaret.

===Garage punk===

Garage punk bands of the 1970s like MC5, Iggy and the Stooges, the Flamin&#x27; Groovies and the Ramones often wore secondhand clothing from the mid-late 1960s, such as velvet jackets, slim-fitting grey suits, black leather jackets, winklepickers and drainpipe jeans, in reaction to the flared trousers worn by hippies and disco fans. Their hair was generally worn long, as was then fashionable in the 1970s, but some fans opted for buzzcuts or Caesar cuts, previously associated with hard mods and bootboys. Following the 1980s garage rock revival, garage punk bands tended to dress more casually, with less overtly 1960s clothing. However, the original garage punk look remained a big influence among British indie rock groups during the mid and late-2000s.

===Glam punk===
Contemporary to the garage bands of the early 1970s, glam punk fashion, pioneered by bands like the New York Dolls, includes glitter, androgynous make-up, brightly dyed hair, drainpipe jeans, bright colours like electric blue, elements of leather fetish wear, and unusual costumes like leopard print, spandex, or satin shirts. Leftover baroque pop clothing like ruffled pirate shirts or brocade were also worn, together with more typical glam rock fashions like platform boots, tartan, kipper ties, and metallic silver clothing like jumpsuits.

===Hardcore punk===
There are several styles of dress within the hardcore scene, and styles have changed since the genre started as &quot;hardcore punk&quot; in the late 1970s. What is fashionable in one branch of the hardcore scene may be frowned upon in another; however, generally, personal comfort and the ability to mosh during the heavily physical, frenetic, and energetic live hardcore punk shows are highly influential in this style. For this reason, jewellery, spikes, chains and spiky hair are more uncommon and discouraged in hardcore fashion. Ultimately, hardcore punk fashion is usually more understated, working class, and casual compared to some more elaborate punk styles, in part as a response to the physical demands of hardcore punk shows and in part as a working class or more &quot;authentic&quot; backlash response against the perceived increasingly fashion-oriented or pretentious developments within the established punk scene.

Plain working class dress and short hair (with the exception of dreadlocks) are usually associated with hardcore punk. Mute colors and minimal adornment are usually common. Elements of hardcore clothing include baggy jeans or work pants (such as Dickies), khakis or cargo pants, athletic wear, tracksuits, cargo or military shorts, band T-shirts, plain T-shirts, muscle shirts, flannel or plaid shirts, and band hoodies. The leather jackets and denim jackets associated with punk fashion remain common in hardcore punk, though hardcore punk also prominently features bomber jackets and track jackets unlike other punk fashions. Common sneakers include classic Adidas Originals, Asics, Converse, New Balance, Nike, Pony, Puma, Reebok, Saucony and Vans. Boots are also somewhat common, especially Dr. Martens.

Hardcore skinheads, sometimes known as &quot;American punk skinheads,&quot; are characterised by some of the same items as British skinhead fashion, but hardcore skinhead dress is considerably less strict than traditional skinhead or oi! skinhead style.

===Horror punk and deathrock===

Horror punk and deathrock fashions are similar to goth fashion. Black is the predominant shade. Deathrock and horror punk incorporate &quot;sexy&quot; items such as fishnet stockings, corsets and elaborate make-up for men and women. The use of occult and horror imagery is prevalent on T-shirts, buttons, patches and jewellery. Other common adornments include band names painted on jackets or bleached into clothes, as well as buttons or patches indicating cities. The initials D and R (for &quot;Death Rock&quot;) is sometimes part of a crossbones logo, accompanied by other initials, such as C and A for California, N and Y for New York, or G and R for Germany. Hair may be in a deathhawk style (a wider teased-out variant of the mohawk hairstyle), an angled bangs style, or a devilock style.

===Pop punk===
Pop punk fashion, sometimes overlaps with skater punk fashion. Originally this consisted of black or tartan baggy pants (sometimes fitted with studs and eyelets), band hoodies, wristbands, patrol caps, pyramid stud belts, dress shirts with thin ties or scarves, blazers and spiky hair or fauxhawks. In the mid-2000s, pop-punk fashion, influenced by indie rock, hip hop and emo fashions, evolved to include cartoon print hoodies, Converse shoes, keffiyehs and skinny jeans. Spiky hair was gradually replaced by skater styles with long fringes or bangs. In the 2010s, pop punk fans took on a more hardcore look, with shorter hair (including Liberty spikes and a wide Mohawk combined with a fringe), plain hoodies and straight-leg jeans.

===Psychobilly===

Psychobilly fashion combines elements of punk with 1950s Greaser and British Teddy Boy fashions. Brothel creepers are frequently worn, as well as leather jackets, gas-station shirts, black or white retro T-shirts, dark-colored drape jackets and vintage motorcycle/work boots. Hair consists of a quiff, pompadour or psychobilly wedge, usually with the sides shaved into a mohawk. Clothing is usually adorned with motifs inspired by classic American horror films or art-styles inspired by Ed &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Roth. This subculture is strongly associated with the Kustom Kulture movement.

===Ska punk===
Ska punk fans typically dress in a style that mixes typical ska- or 2 Tone-related fashions, with various types of punk fashions, including street punk, pop punk, skate punk or hardcore punk. Braces are popular, as are Harrington jackets with royal Stewart tartan lining, thin ties, Doc Martens, mohair suits, pork pie hats, tonik suits (especially in the early years of the 1980s ska revival), tank tops, Ben Sherman or Fred Perry polo shirts, hoodies, and checkerboard patterns. Hair is cropped very short in imitation of hardcore punk bands and early 1960s rude boys. as of 1990s and today many ska fans dressed out normally with regular or simple clothing.

===Skate punk===

Skate punk is a derivative of hardcore fashion and is chosen with comfort and practicality in mind. Common skate punk clothing items include T-shirts, flannel button-down shirts, hooded sweatshirts, webbing belts, and khaki shorts, pants or jeans. Some punks, especially in Southern California, mirror Latino gang styles, including khaki Dickies work pants, white T-shirts and colored bandanas. While some skateboarders have long and messy hair, skate punks usually have short hair, often shaved into a buzzcut, and wear little jewelry.

===Street punk and Oi!===
In general, contemporary street punks wear leather, denim, metal spikes or studs, chains and military-style boots. They often wear elements of early punk fashion, such as kutten vests, bondage trousers (often plaid) and torn clothing. DIY-created and modified clothing, such as ripped or stitched-together trousers or shirts, or trousers that are tightly tapered, are common. Jackets and vests often have patches or are painted with logos that express musical tastes or political views. Bullet belts and belts with metal studs are popular. Hair is often spiked and/or dyed in bright, unnatural colors and arranged into a mohawk or liberty spikes, but it is sometimes cut very short or shaved.

Oi! skinheads, sometimes known as skunks or punk-skinheads, fuse traditional skinhead style with street punk fashions. The look is characterised by Dr. Martens boots (or similar boots made by a different brand), braces, and tight rolled-up jeans, sometimes splattered with bleach. Other common items are T-shirts (featuring band names, political beliefs or other text and images relevant to skinhead culture) and denim jackets or flight jackets. These jackets are sometimes decorated with buttons or patches, and in the case of the denim jackets, sometimes splattered with bleach. Hair is typically shaved shorter than with traditional skinheads. Other items from traditional skinhead fashion (e.g. Fred Perry and Ben Sherman shirts) and, to a lesser extent, punk fashion items (e.g. short mohawk hairstyles, metal studs on jackets) are also sometimes worn.

====Droog====
During the early 1980s, some street punks and Oi! skinheads adopted elements of the dress style from the film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. On stage, bands like The Adicts, or more recently The Bolokos and Japan&#x27;s Hat Trickers, often wear bowler hats, white shirts, white trousers, braces, and black combat boots in imitation of Alex De Large, the protagonist of the film and novel. Some fans also wore fishtail coats, although more often they wore black leather biker jackets or long black Crombie coats.

=== Rivethead ===

A &quot;rivethead&quot; or &quot;rivet head&quot; is a person associated with the industrial dance music scene. In stark contrast to the original industrial culture, whose performers and heterogeneous audience were sometimes referred to as &quot;industrialists&quot;, the rivethead scene is a coherent youth culture closely linked to a discernible fashion style. The scene emerged in the late 1980s on the basis of electro-industrial, EBM, and industrial rock music. The associated dress style draws on military fashion and punk aesthetics with hints of fetish wear, mainly inspired by the scene&#x27;s musical protagonists.

<text>Adele Astaire Douglass (born Adele Marie Austerlitz, later known as Lady Charles Cavendish; September 10, 1896 – January 25, 1981) was an American dancer, stage actress, and singer. After beginning work as a dancer and vaudeville performer at the age of nine, Astaire built a successful performance career with her younger brother, Fred Astaire.

The brother and sister act initially worked their way through vaudeville circuits, finally achieving a breakthrough with their first Broadway roles in 1917. Astaire became known for her talents as a skilled dancer and comedienne, starring in hit Broadway musicals such as &quot;Lady, Be Good!&quot; (1924), &quot;Funny Face&quot; (1927) and &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1931)&quot;.&quot; The siblings took several of their more popular shows to Britain&#x27;s West End during the 1920s, where they were soon international celebrities, meeting members of the British royal family and prominent figures from contemporary arts and literature circles.

In 1932, after a 27-year partnership with her brother, Astaire retired from the stage to marry Lord Charles Arthur Francis Cavendish, the second son of Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire. The couple moved to the Cavendish estate of Lismore Castle in Ireland. Despite offers of both stage and film roles from producers eager to see her return to acting, Astaire declined to come out of retirement. Following Cavendish&#x27;s death in 1944, Astaire remarried and moved back to the United States. She divided her time between properties in the United States; Round Hill, Jamaica; and her old home of Lismore Castle, where she spent her summers up until the end of her life.

In 1972, Astaire was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

In 1975, Astaire was inducted into the International Best Dressed Hall of Fame List.

==Early life and vaudeville (1896–1917)==
Adele Marie Austerlitz was born on September 10, 1896, in Omaha, Nebraska. Her parents were Johanna &quot;Ann&quot; Geilus, an American-born Lutheran of German descent, and Frederic &quot;Fritz&quot; Austerlitz, an Austrian-born Roman Catholic of Jewish descent. Adele&#x27;s younger brother, Fred Austerlitz, was born three years after her.

Adele&#x27;s birth year is cited incorrectly in some sources. Adele&#x27;s mother became pregnant shortly before turning 16 years old, and married in 1894 with her father&#x27;s consent. That pregnancy did not come to term, and the couple later told people they had married in 1896 in order to avoid a perception of impropriety. The fictional marriage year created a second perception of impropriety when Adele was born in 1896, so the family later changed references to Adele&#x27;s birthdate to 1897 or 1898. The altered timelines create confusion over the age gap between Adele and her brother Fred, with various sources giving the difference as anywhere from half a year to three years.

After Adele showed an early propensity for dance, she was enrolled in a local dance school. She soon stood out for her natural ability as a dancer, and began making appearances at local recitals and parties. Her parents decided to enroll Fred as well — a somewhat frail child in his earliest years — with the intention of having him build strength through dance training, and he, too, showed the beginnings of aptitude. When Adele was eight and Fred was five, a teacher suggested that the two children might have a stage career if they received proper training. This prompted the family to move from Omaha to New York, though the father returned to Omaha to work. Adele, Fred and their mother lived in a boarding house, and the children began attending the Alviene Master School of the Theatre and Academy of Cultural Arts. Adele and Fred adopted the more American-sounding surname Astaire after trying several variations on the original Austerlitz, and their mother Ann also adopted the new surname.
In late 1905, with the assistance of her dance instructor Claude Alvienne, Adele Astaire began a professional vaudeville act with Fred. Alvienne helped them develop a routine involving two large, elaborate set pieces in the form of wedding cakes. Astaire and her brother, dressed up as a small bride and groom, danced up and down the cakes and activated small electric lights and musical bells with their feet. They played a simple waltz through their dance steps. The siblings performed intermittently at first, with their mother Ann acting as their manager and costume designer. They gained additional training from the ballet school of the Metropolitan Opera and from American choreographer Ned Wayburn. Ann Astaire home schooled her children, with the exception of a stint in New Jersey, when Adele and Fred put their performance career on hold and attended regular school for two and half years. The adolescent Adele had grown so tall at the time that her smaller, younger brother, still catching up in height, looked awkward dancing with her.

After returning to the vaudeville circuit in 1911, Astaire and her brother struggled to find steady work for the next couple of years. Agents were initially uninterested in representing the relatively unknown pair. In 1913, Astaire&#x27;s father introduced the siblings to Aurelio Coccia, an experienced dance instructor and showman. He taught several new dances to the young Astaires and developed a new, more mature vaudeville routine for them. Bookings became more frequent after this, as the pair gradually improved their act and reputation. In 1916, the siblings encountered a difficult year when the White Rats of America, a union of vaudeville performers, staged a workers&#x27; strike that spread nationally, creating tense working relations between performers and vaudeville managers. Astaire and her brother, although not union members, lost valuable income nonetheless, and their father, unlucky enough to be working at a Nebraska brewery when state-wide prohibition was approved, was unable to offer financial support. When the union strike finally ended, the Astaire siblings returned to work at last, achieving a highly successful season.

As they grew older, the contrasting personalities of the siblings grew more distinct. Adele was a &quot;perennial live wire&quot;: lively, gregarious, and known for her raw frankness, along with her colorful swearing. Fred, the hardworking perfectionist, was quieter and constantly anxious about all the details of their day-to-day work. While Fred might come to a venue two hours early to prepare for their show, Adele was more likely to arrive only minutes before she was due on stage. Despite their differences in temperament, the siblings were close. Astaire affectionately nicknamed her younger brother &quot;Moaning Minnie&quot; for his tendency to worry about every possible thing that could go wrong.

== Broadway career (1917–1932) ==
In 1917, after Fred carefully purchased a full-page advertisement on the back cover of &quot;Variety&quot;, the siblings landed a part in their first Broadway show, Lee Shubert&#x27;s &quot;Over the Top&quot;. Adele was 21, while her brother was 18. The show opened on November 28, 1917, and the siblings received a weekly salary of $250 (equivalent to $ in ) for their assigned dance numbers and comedy skits. A critic from &quot;The New York Globe&quot; commented that the dancing of Adele and her brother was &quot;one of the prettiest features of the show&quot;, and the production ran for 78 performances. To prepare for her work singing in Broadway musicals during the late 1910s and 1920s, she took voice lessons with Estelle Liebling who was the voice teacher of many famous singers at the Metropolitan Opera and on Broadway.
Adele and Fred performed in &quot;The Passing Show of 1918&quot;, which ran for 125 performances. Astaire was given an opening solo, singing &quot;I Really Can&#x27;t Make My Feet Behave&quot;. In November 1919, the Astaires appeared in the operetta &quot;Apple Blossoms&quot;, beginning a professional relationship with Broadway producer Charles Dillingham. The show was successful, running for 256 performances. Fritz came to see his children perform. Their weekly salary was now $550, which rose to $750 (equivalent to $ &amp; $ in ) when &quot;Apple Blossoms&quot; began its post-Broadway tour from September 1920 to April 1921. Unlike her brother, who struggled with shyness offstage, Astaire&#x27;s outgoing personality made it easy for her to speak to reporters.
Although their next show &quot;The Love Letter&quot; was a commercial flop, opening in October 1921 and running for only 31 performances, Astaire and her brother continued to garner appreciation from audiences, and here they introduced what would become one of their signature exit moves, the Runaround. Standing shoulder to shoulder at the end of a dance number, the siblings would put their arms out as if grasping the handlebars of bicycles, running around the stage together in ever-growing circles while the orchestra played &quot;a series of oompahs&quot;. At last, Adele and Fred would disappear into the wings. Audiences loved it. Fred attributed the popularity of the Runaround to his sister&#x27;s comedic timing and expressions, and the siblings found ways to incorporate the move into almost every show of their subsequent career together. While visiting New York for the first time that year, English playwright Noël Coward saw &quot;The Love Letter&quot; and was impressed by the Astaires. He came to meet them backstage, urging them to consider taking their performances to London.

In 1922, Adele and Fred landed their first proper speaking roles in the Broadway musical &quot;For Goodness Sake&quot;, playing the best friends of the lead characters. They received positive reviews from critics, and sang the hit song &quot;The Whichness of the Whatness&quot;, concluding the piece with their increasingly popular Runaround exit. With the success of this show, Fred began taking more of a lead in choreographing their routines. The siblings finally received star billing in the short-lived &quot;The Bunch and Judy&quot;, earning $1000 (equivalent to $ in ) weekly. Drama critic Heywood Broun called the Astaires &quot;the most graceful and charming young dancers in the world of musical comedy&quot;.

As the siblings continued to rise professionally, Adele quickly became known for her comedic expressions and &quot;adorably squeaky&quot; soprano voice. She often ad-libbed onstage. She gave high-spirited performances, delighting audiences with her zany humor; Fred developed his own more understated style in response, dancing with a characteristic &quot;pretence of nonchalance&quot; that he would carry on using throughout his dancing career. Adele and her brother developed a dancing style involving complex steps performed rapidly and gracefully, often compared to &quot;a whirlwind&quot; by critics and audiences.
After the idea of performing overseas was suggested, Adele and Fred agreed to take &quot;For Goodness Sake&quot; (renamed &quot;Stop Flirting&quot;) to the West End in London. On May 30, 1923, their show opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre and received a standing ovation. &quot;Stop Flirting&quot; ran for 418 performances. It moved to the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, followed by the Strand Theatre. The Prince of Wales attended the show ten times, and both he and his brother the Duke of York became friends with the siblings. Adele taught Edward some new tap dance steps, and the pair once danced together at a club. As the Astaires&#x27; popularity grew, both Adele and Fred were featured in major advertising campaigns. While in London, Peter Pan creator J. M. Barrie asked Adele to play his creation on stage, but contractual reasons forced her to turn down the part. In early 1924, Adele received word that her father, Fritz, had died from cancer.

Returning to New York in late 1924, Adele and her brother starred in &quot;Lady, Be Good!&quot;, the first Broadway musical scored entirely by George and Ira Gershwin. It was a hit with audiences, running for 330 performances. The siblings earned $1750 per week. One critic called Adele the most charming and entertaining musical actress seen &quot;in many a moon&quot;. In the spring of 1926, Adele and her brother took &quot;Lady, Be Good!&quot; to London, opening at the Empire Theatre to enthusiastic reception. The siblings renewed their acquaintance with the British royal family, receiving an invitation from the Duke and Duchess of York to meet the newborn Princess Elizabeth. King George V and Queen Mary also made a special visit to see the Astaires perform.
In 1927, Adele and Fred joined forces with the Gershwin brothers again in New York for their new musical &quot;Funny Face&quot;. The show was another hit. Shortly after the opening, the Astaires arranged for a film screen test with Paramount Pictures. The film studio hoped to feature Adele and her brother in a film version of &quot;Funny Face&quot;, but the siblings were both unsatisfied with the initial screen test results, and the project never went ahead. On the Broadway stage, &quot;Funny Face&quot; ran for 250 performances, closing only due to a summer heatwave in 1928 that made theaters too hot for audiences and performers. That summer, Adele was injured in an accident on Long Island when a motorboat engine exploded, scalding her upper body with burning oil. Although her career was put on hold for a few months, she made a full recovery.

The Astaires&#x27; London debut of &quot;Funny Face&quot; took place in November 1928. The show ran for 263 performances, and British newspapers hailed &quot;another outbreak of &#x27;Astairia&#x27;&quot; as audiences embraced the American duo once again. On the night of their final performance in London, Adele was introduced to Lord Charles Cavendish, the second son of the 9th Duke of Devonshire. Cavendish was several years younger than Adele. The pair were quickly attracted to each other, spending time together in Paris before Adele returned to America with Fred. They met again soon afterwards when Cavendish came to New York and took a position with J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.

Although their next show, &quot;Smiles&quot; (1930), was a commercial flop, Adele and her brother soon made their comeback with another hit, starring in their final Broadway show together, &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;, which opened on June 3, 1931, and ran for 260 performances. Other members of &quot;The Band Wagon&#x27;s&quot; cast included Tilly Losch, Helen Broderick and Frank Morgan. Critics applauded the creative, decidedly modern writing and set design of the show, which included a custom-built &quot;double revolve&quot; turntable stage: the turntable revolved in two directions at once, revealing new scenes quickly and smoothly while the performers danced and sang.

==Retirement and first marriage (1932–1944)==
After the two had been courting for some time, Adele proposed marriage to Charles Cavendish at a speakeasy named 21, and he accepted. She was tired of the relentless travel and rehearsals required of a performer, and had been considering retirement. For her, theatrical life had always been &quot;an acquired taste... like olives&quot;.

In Chicago on March 5, 1932, after one final performance with Fred in &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;, Adele officially retired from the stage. She had been performing with her brother for 27 years. American drama critic Ashton Stevens declared her departure from theater a sad occasion, commenting that &quot;Heaven doesn&#x27;t send every generation an Adele Astaire&quot;. Following a farewell party, Adele and her mother boarded the and sailed for London, while Fred remained in the United States to continue his career. Adele renewed a friendship with fellow passenger Winston Churchill, whom she had earlier met while performing in England, and the pair enjoyed games of backgammon together during the voyage. Upon the ship&#x27;s docking in Plymouth, reporters attempted to ambush Adele and were deterred only by Churchill, who distracted them until Adele and her mother could disembark without harassment.

In April of that year, after rejoining Charles, Adele met the rest of the Cavendish family for the first time. Her future sister-in-law, Lady Mary Gascoyne-Cecil, later gleefully recollected Adele&#x27;s colorful entrance: Adele was formally announced, quietly entered the room where the Cavendish family was waiting, and then launched herself into a series of cartwheels across the floor until she had reached her new relatives. Despite the initial reservations of Charles&#x27;s mother, the Duchess of Devonshire, Adele was welcomed by the family. The wedding was briefly postponed when Charles was hospitalized for appendicitis, his ill health exacerbated by heavy drinking, but on May 9, 1932, Adele Astaire married Lord Charles Cavendish in the family&#x27;s private chapel at Chatsworth, receiving the courtesy title of &quot;Lady Charles&quot;. The couple moved to County Waterford in Ireland, where they lived at the family estate of Lismore Castle. Adele paid for the installation of several new, modern bathrooms to replace the castle&#x27;s antiquated facilities, joking that this was her gift to the family in place of the more traditional dowries brought by rich, aristocratic heiresses. Back in the United States, Fred initially struggled to adjust to his new dancing partners; Adele sent Fred a teasing telegram right before the first performance of his new show, &quot;The Gay Divorce&quot;: &quot;Now Minnie, don&#x27;t forget to moan&quot;.

In 1933, Adele gave birth prematurely to a daughter, who did not survive. Two years later, she gave birth to stillborn twin sons. She struggled with periods of depression and an increasingly difficult home life. Charles grappled with severe alcoholism, spending periods of time in hospitals, nursing homes and German spas as he tried unsuccessfully to conquer his addiction. In 1936, American film producer David Selznick offered Adele a supporting role in his film &quot;Dark Victory&quot;, but she was unsatisfied with the screen tests and preoccupied with caring for her husband, ultimately declining the job offer. She turned down another film role from Selznick a year later. In 1939, Adele, aged forty-two, suffered a miscarriage in her third and final pregnancy.

In 1942, as Adele searched for ways to contribute to the wartime effort, she met Colonel Kingman Douglass, the American chief of U.S. Air Force Intelligence who was stationed in London. Douglass suggested that Adele work at the American Red Cross&#x27;s &#x27;Rainbow Corner&#x27; canteen, located near Piccadilly Circus. Adele agreed to his suggestion. Her mother, who had remained in Ireland to be near her daughter, now stayed home at Lismore to care for the often bed-ridden Charles, sending Adele regular updates. In London, Adele wrote letters home for soldiers, writing and posting up to 130 letters in a single week. She took shifts at the information desk, danced with soldiers, and helped the men shop for necessities while in London. After the London Blitz began, she increased her work hours and served at the Rainbow Corner seven days per week. Adele&#x27;s wartime work gave her a renewed sense of purpose and fulfillment, helping her cope with recent personal difficulties.

In March 1944, Charles died as a result of long-term alcohol poisoning, aged 38. Adele received compassionate leave to attend his funeral at St. Carthage&#x27;s, where Charles was buried near his children. Following his death, Adele turned down an offer from Irving Berlin to return to the stage in &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;.

==Second marriage and later life (1947–1980)==

In April 1947, Adele remarried, this time to her old American acquaintance from the war, Kingman Douglass. Douglass, who had previously been married and divorced, now worked as an investment banker. He later briefly served as assistant director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Initially lacking the personal funds necessary to move back to America, Adele broke the news of her engagement to the Cavendish family in Ireland, and received their financial support to move on to the next stage of her life. She was also given permission to continue spending three months a year at Lismore Castle, provided that she helped contribute towards the upkeep of the property. Adele gained three stepsons from her marriage to Douglass. Aside from returning to Lismore Castle periodically, Adele and her new husband lived in New York, Virginia, and eventually Round Hill, Jamaica. Adele often entertained family and friends at her Jamaica home. 

Adele remained retired from stage life. In 1953, authors P. G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton, both fans of Adele, wrote a teasing epilogue for her and her brother Fred, who had successfully transitioned to film work after his Broadway career.

In 1968, Douglass received injuries after being struck by a bus. Soon afterwards, he was injured again in a car accident. He died in 1971 due to a brain hemorrhage. Afterward, Adele moved to the Phoenix, Arizona area. Until 1979, she continued to spend summers at the castle in Ireland which she had shared with her first husband. Adele was known for her robust health, regularly jogging nearly every morning well into her late seventies. According to her relatives, Adele quickly overcame illnesses, soon getting back on her feet &quot;and in Marine-type English, telling what she thought of the world.&quot; She remained close with her brother, Fred. They constantly exchanged letters, packages, and long-distance phone calls, often chatting about their favorite soap operas.

In November 1972, Adele and her brother were both inducted into the newly created American Theater Hall of Fame. In 1975, the Astaires&#x27; mother died at the age of 96.

==Death and legacy==
Adele Astaire died on January 25, 1981, in Scottsdale Memorial Hospital, Scottsdale, Arizona, after suffering a stroke. She was 84. Some of her ashes were scattered in Ireland, by Lismore Castle and the graves of her children and first husband, while the rest were buried near her mother&#x27;s grave in Chatsworth, California.

In the early 1980s, the Anglo-American Contemporary Dance Foundation created the Fred and Adele Astaire Awards to recognize outstanding Broadway dancers and choreographers. The Gottlieb Storz House in Omaha includes the &quot;Adele and Fred Astaire Ballroom&quot; on the top floor, which is the only memorial to the siblings&#x27; roots in Omaha. Although there is no surviving film footage of Astaire&#x27;s Broadway performances, recordings do exist of her duets with Fred, George Vollaire and Bernard Clifton.

<text>Lismore Castle () is a castle located in the town of Lismore, County Waterford, Ireland. It belonged to the Earls of Desmond, the Earls of Cork, and then to the Cavendish family from 1753. It is currently the Irish home of the Duke of Devonshire. The first castle on the site was built in 1185, and replaced, twice, in the 16th century. It was largely rebuilt in the Gothic style during the mid-nineteenth century for the 6th Duke of Devonshire.

==Early history==

Built as the sister castle to Ardfinnan Castle in 1185 by the Lord of Ireland, Prince John of England to guard the river crossing, the castle site was originally occupied by Lismore Abbey, an important monastery and seat of learning established in the early 7th century. 

It was still an ecclesiastical centre when King Henry II of England stayed here in 1171, and except for a brief period after 1185 (when he had assigned his son King John of England to build a &#x27;castellum&#x27; here) when it served as the episcopal residence of the local bishop. 

It was a possession of the Earls of Desmond, whose lands were broken up during the plantations following the killing of Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond, in 1583.

In 1589, Lismore was leased and later acquired by Sir Walter Raleigh. Raleigh sold the property during his imprisonment for High Treason in 1602 to Richard Boyle, who was later made the 1st Earl of Cork in 1620.

==Earls of Cork and Burlington==
Boyle came to the Kingdom of Ireland from the Kingdom of England in 1588 with only twenty-seven pounds in capital and proceeded to amass an extraordinary fortune. After purchasing Lismore he made it his principal seat and transformed it into a magnificent residence with impressive gabled ranges each side of the courtyard. He also built a castellated outer wall and a gatehouse known as the Riding Gate. 

The principal apartments were decorated with fretwork plaster ceilings, tapestry hangings, embroidered silks and velvet. It was here in 1626 that Robert Boyle, &quot;the Father of Modern Chemistry&quot;, the fourteenth of the Earl&#x27;s fifteen children, was born. The castle eventually descended to the 3rd Earl of Burlington and 4th Earl of Cork (1694-1753), who was a noted influence on Georgian architecture (and is usually known in architectural histories as the Earl of Burlington).

Lismore featured in the Cromwellian wars when, in 1645, a force of Catholic confederacy commanded by Lord Castlehaven sacked the town and castle. Some restoration was carried out by the 1st Earl of Burlington and 2nd Earl of Cork (1612–1698) to make it habitable again, but neither he nor his successors lived at Lismore.

==Dukes of Devonshire==

The castle (along with other Boyle properties – Chiswick House, Burlington House, Bolton Abbey and Londesborough Hall) was acquired by the Cavendish family in 1753 when Lady Charlotte Boyle (1731-1754), the daughter and heiress of the 3rd Earl of Burlington and 4th Earl of Cork, married the Marquess of Hartington, who later became, in 1755, the 4th Duke of Devonshire (1720-1764), a future Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Great Britain. Their son, the 5th Duke (1748–1811), carried out improvements at Lismore, notably the bridge across the River Blackwater in 1775 which was designed by Cork-born architect Thomas Ivory.

The 6th Duke (1790–1858), commonly known as &#x27;the Bachelor Duke&#x27;, was responsible for the castle&#x27;s present appearance. He began transforming the castle into a fashionable &#x27;quasi-feudal ultra-regal fortress&#x27; as soon as he succeeded his father in 1811, engaging the architect William Atkinson from 1812 to 1822 to rebuild the castle in the Gothic style, using cut stone shipped over from Derbyshire. Lismore was always the Bachelor Duke&#x27;s favourite residence, but as he grew older his love for the place developed into a passion. 

In 1850 he engaged his architect Sir Joseph Paxton, the designer of the Crystal Palace, to carry out improvements and additions to the castle on a magnificent scale – so much so that the present skyline is largely Paxton&#x27;s work. At this time, J.G. Crace of London, the leading maker of Gothic Revival furniture, and his partner, the leading architect A.W.N. Pugin, were commissioned to transform the ruined chapel of the old Bishop&#x27;s Palace into a medieval-style banqueting hall, with a huge perpendicular stained-glass window, choir-stalls and Gothic stenciling on the walls and roof timbers. 

The chimney-piece, which was exhibited at the Medieval Court of the Great Exhibition of 1851, was also designed by Pugin (and Myers) but was originally intended for Horsted Place in Sussex; it was rejected because it was too elaborate and subsequently bought for Lismore – the Barchard family emblems later replaced with the present Irish inscription &quot;Cead Mille Fáilte&quot;: &#x27;a hundred thousand welcomes&#x27;. Pugin also designed other chimney-pieces and furnishings in the castle and, after his death in 1851, Crace continued to supply furnishings in the Puginesque manner. 

In 1858, the Cavendish family sponsored a new bridge over the Blackwater, which replaced the one built in 1775. This new construction followed designs by Charles Tarrant and was done by E.P. Nagle and C.H. Hunt.

After the death of the 6th Duke in 1858, Lismore remained substantially unaltered. It became the home of a younger son of the 9th Duke, Lord Charles Cavendish, who married Adele Astaire, the sister and former dancing partner of Fred Astaire. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1944 and her remarriage in 1947, Adele continued to use the castle until shortly before her own death in 1981. 

The castle was only used by the 11th Duke of Devonshire for brief annual visits, generally over Easter. In the last years of his tenure it was made available for short-term rent. The 12th Duke, who succeeded to the title in 2004, continues to live primarily on the family&#x27;s Chatsworth estate. 

His son and heir, Lord Burlington, who has an apartment in the castle, has been given management of it, and in 2005 converted the derelict west range into a contemporary art gallery, known as Lismore Castle Arts. The remainder of the interior is not open to the public, but is available for hire by groups of up to twenty-three visitors.

The castle features gardens, which are open to the public. The upper garden is a 17th-century walled garden, while much of the informal lower garden was designed in the 19th century. Under Lord Burlington the planting has been enhanced, and contemporary sculpture added, including works by Sir Antony Gormley, Marzia Colonna and Eilís O&#x27;Connell.

<doc id="127172" wikidata="Q3708593" url="?curid=127172" title="Romulus, New York">
<text>Romulus is a town in Seneca County, New York, United States. The population was 3,203 at the 2020 census. The town is named after the mythical founder of Rome, Romulus, a name assigned by a clerk with an interest in the classics. It is part of the Seneca Falls, NY Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Rochester-Batavia-Seneca Falls Combined statistical area.

The town has a hamlet (and census-designated place), also called Romulus. Government offices for the town are located in nearby Willard.

Romulus is home of the rare Seneca white deer, one of the largest populations of white deer in the world. They are located on the grounds of the former Seneca Army Depot. It is now a private wildlife refuge and conservation center which offers scenic tours.

== History ==
Before the American Revolution, this area was controlled by both the Cayuga and the Seneca nations of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois). French Jesuit missionaries visited the area in the 17th century. The Sullivan Expedition in 1779 destroyed native villages and drove many of the Native Americans away. Romulus contains the area of Kendaia (Apple Town), a former Iroquois (Seneca) village destroyed by the residents in anticipation of the arrival of the Sullivan Expedition on September 5, 1779.

After the war, this town became part of the Central New York Military Tract, land for veterans of the Revolution. Returning natives were provided with land at the north end of Cayuga Lake. This reservation was partly in the eastern side of modern Romulus. The first non-native settlers arrived around 1789.

The town was formed while still part of Onondaga County in 1794. In 1800, part of Romulus was used to make the town of Fayette. The north part of Romulus was used to form the town of Varick in 1830.

The town also contains the former Seneca Army Depot (1941 - 1990s), built during World War II and finally closed in 2001. It was a major employer for citizens of Romulus and surrounding parts of Seneca County. Seneca Army Airfield, located along N.Y. Route 96A, provided a long runway for transport aircraft.

Willard State Hospital was converted to a state prison drug treatment center in 1995.

The town is home to the Five Points Correctional Facility, a New York state maximum security prison for men.

(Portions of a diary written by Henry McLafferty Jr (1819–1859) are available online from the Rochester Public Library: Romulus Revisited: Extracts from the Diary of Henry McLafferty, Jr. 1856–1857).

==Geography==
The town lies between Cayuga Lake and Seneca Lake at latitude 42° 45&#x27; 8&quot; N. and longitude 76° 50&#x27; 2&quot; W. at an altitude of 705 ft (214 m).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (26.45%) is water.

Romulus is in the Finger Lakes district of New York and lies between Cayuga Lake and Seneca Lake.

<text>Varick is a town in Seneca County, New York, United States. The population was 1,656 at the 2020 census. The town is named after Richard Varick, an officer in the American Revolution, mayor of New York City, and uncle of the first Town Supervisor, Anthony Dey.

The Town of Varick is located in the central part of the county and is southeast of Geneva.

There is no post office in the Town of Varick. The primary postal district covering the area is Zip Code 14541 for Romulus.

== History ==
The land that is now the Town of Varick was occupied by the Cayuga and Seneca tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy before European settlement. Jesuits made missionary visits from 1656 to 1684.

The Sullivan Expedition of 1779 passed through the town to destroy villages of the Cayuga and Seneca tribes. After the American Revolution, most of the current Town of Varick was placed in the Central New York Military Tract (1788), land reserved for veterans, with an eastern part in the Cayuga Indian Reservation (1790 until 1795). White settlement followed.

The town was formed from the Town of Romulus in 1830.

During World War II, a large part of the town was appropriated by the US Government to form the Seneca Army Depot (1941–2001), which was a major employer and the only large industry.

Over the years since 1985, Varick has become home to five wineries, all closer to the eastern end of the town, along Cayuga Lake. From north to south, the five are Swedish Hill Vineyard, Cobblestone Farm Winery, Lakeshore Winery, Knapp Winery and Vineyard Restaurant, and Goose Watch Winery. (All but Lakeshore Winery are participating members of the Cayuga Lake Wine Trail, and while the Seneca Lake Wine Trail certainly runs through Varick, none of its stops quite fall within its town lines.)

The Simon Ritter Cobblestone Farmhouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

The St. Regis River, a tributary of the St. Lawrence River, flows in the western part of the town. The Deer River flows into the St. Regis at Helena. Smaller tributaries are Bell Brook, Squeak Brook, Lawrence Brook, Red Water Brook and Trout Brook. Red Water Brook was dammed in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. At the location of the pond, Walter Pratt Memorial Forest is the site of a primitive camping and picnic area operated by NY State Dept. of Environmental Conservation, known locally as the &quot;CC Dam&quot;. There are nearly 20,000 acres of NY State owned forest lands in the town and the DEC has a maintenance facility located near Vice Rd. in Brasher Falls. Many miles of Trails are maintained in the State Forest. These trails are used for hiking, hunting, fishing, cross-country skiing, horseback riding and snowmobiling. All terrain vehicles have been a subject of controversy and are not currently permitted on state lands.

New York State Route 37C is an east–west highway in the northern part of Brasher. New York State Route 11C passes through the southwest corner of the town.

Brasher Falls and the neighboring hamlet of Winthrop have a municipal sewer system. A study of the feasibility of municipal water in Brasher Falls- Winthrop area has stirred controversy. Contaminated wells in the area has generated interest, however many residents have suitable wells and do not favor the added expense. The hamlet of Helena has a municipal water system, necessitated by ground water contamination rendering the area&#x27;s well water unsuitable. Landline telephone and internet service is provided by: Verizon, Nicholville Telephone Company, SLIC and Time-Warner; with wireless service provided by Verizon Wireless and AT&amp;T. Enbridge supplies natural gas to the Brasher Falls- Winthrop area.

The first settlement was begun by Elias Teall, who made a contract on October 24, 1823, with the proprietors of the east half of Scriba, and undertook to secure settlers on the tract. He built a mill on the east branch of the Oswegatchie and made some small improvements; but his undertaking failed. September 6, 1828, James C. Haile made a contract with the proprietors, and built a sawmill and a small grist mill on the Oswegatchie; he induced other settlers to come. In May 1833, he also left the town, his settlers having abandoned him. In February 1834, Arnasa I. Brown contracted with the owners for the Haile improvements and an additional tract of land, and in March of that year moved his family in; his nearest neighbors were ten miles away. A few others joined him, and by 1843 there were 43 or 44 voters.

The little hamlet of Fine is on the east branch of the Oswegatchie River about five miles southeast of South Edwards. It has been locally known as &quot;Smithville&quot; from William P. Smith, who was an early resident there.

The town was organized in 1849 from parts of the Towns of Pierrepont and Russell.

<text>Lisbon is a town in St. Lawrence County, New York, United States. The population was 4,102 at the 2010 census.

By some accounts, the town is named after Lisbon, the capital of Portugal. However, the 1810 US Census for the town shows its name as &quot;Lisburn&quot;. This is the same as a city in Northern Ireland, adjacent to the capital of Belfast. 

The Irish city is the more likely namesake, since Belfast was the birthplace of Alexander Macomb, a prosperous New York City merchant of Loyalist sympathies who was instrumental in land speculation in Northern New York. In 1791, he had purchased much of the territory along the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario, which the state had released for public sale after forced cession of the land by the Iroquois nations following United States independence in the American Revolution. With partners, Macomb sold the land for development. The Town of Lisbon is in the northern part of the county and is northwest of Canton.
== History ==
The area along the St. Lawrence River had been occupied by Iroquoian peoples, as noted by early French explorers. They are thought to have been defeated by members of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy who dominated the area of present-day New York state west of Albany. They preserved this area as hunting ground and conducted fur trading with French colonists along the river.

The first European-American settlers arrived around 1799. Many migrants arrived in the area from New England and were eager to buy land. Demand had risen during the American Revolution. Macomb and his partners believed that upstate New York was strategic for prosperous development, as they were depending on the growing trade with Canada across the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario. 

Two factors worked against this: due to rising tensions with Great Britain, the US government passed the Embargo Act of 1807, prohibiting trade with Britain (and including the Canadian colonies. While smuggling across the lakes and rivers occurred, the act suppressed trade with Canada, as did the War of 1812 and restrictions afterward. The completion of the Erie Canal in 1824 shifted growth and development to the Great Lakes area, as it opened trade from that area through Central New York, connecting with the Hudson River and New York City. Migrant populations were drawn to the west. 

The Town of Lisbon was the first town in the county; it was formed in 1801, before the county was established. The former Lisbon Railroad Depot, now operated as the town museum, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Also listed are the Lisbon Town Hall, the United Presbyterian Church, and the Hepburn Library of Lisbon. The Presbyterian Church, essentially the national church of Scotland, was a sign of settlement in the area by ethnic Scots-Irish people from Scotland and Ireland.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (4.78%) is water. The northern town line is marked by the St. Lawrence River, which is the international border with Canada, the Province of Ontario. 

The town borders Ogdensburg, New York at its northwest corner. New York State Route 37 and New York State Route 68 are highways that converge west of the town in Ogdensburg. NY-37 follows the south bank of St. Lawrence River in a northeasterly direction, and NY-68 runs southeasterly to Canton.

<text>Louisville is a town in St. Lawrence County, New York, United States. The population was 3,145 at the 2010 census. The town is reportedly named after King Louis XIV of France, but is pronounced as &quot;Lewis-ville.&quot;

The Town of Louisville is at the northern border of the county and is west of Village of Massena.

== History ==
Nahum Wilson, originally from Peru, NY, and his family were the first to settle the area in April 1800.

The town was established in 1810 from part of the Town of Massena. Almost half of Louisville was lost to form the Town of Norfolk in 1823. Part of the lost territory was returned from the Town of Norfolk in 1844. An attempt to take part of Louisville for the Town of Massena in 1849 was rejected.

Early settlers frequently interacted with their Canadian neighbours (then British North America) and both would often cross the St. Lawrence River to meet. During the War of 1812, although they still had good relations with their neighbours, the men of Louisville formed a militia and elected Benjamin Daniels as their &quot;high sergeant&quot;. The militia controlled traffic down the river, but were ordered to allow Native Americans to pass.

After the war, meetings between the residents and Canadians would still take place confidentially overnight.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (24.58%) is water.

The northern town line, which is delineated by the St. Lawrence River, is the international border with Canada, specifically the Province of Ontario. The Grasse River flows northeastward through the town.

New York State Route 37 is an east–west highway in the northern part of the town. New York State Route 131 is a short highway near the St. Lawrence River.

<text>Ogdensburg is a city in St. Lawrence County, New York, United States. The population was 10,064 at the 2020 census. In the late 18th century, European-American settlers named the community after American land owner and developer Samuel Ogden. The city is at the northern border of New York at the mouth of the Oswegatchie River on the south bank of the St. Lawrence River. The only formally designated city in the county, it is located between Massena, New York to the east and Brockville, Ontario to the west.

The port of Ogdensburg is the only U.S. port on the St. Lawrence Seaway. The Ogdensburg–Prescott International Bridge, northeast of the city, links the United States and Canada, with a direct highway from Prescott to Ottawa, the capital of Canada.

==History==

This territory has been inhabited for at least 2000 years by Indigenous peoples of varying cultures. By 1000 CE, Iroquoian-speaking people were settling along the St. Lawrence River and practicing agriculture, as well as hunting and fishing. The earliest French explorers recorded Stadacona and Hochelaga as villages of these people in the early 16th century; by the end of the century, later explorers found the villages abandoned. A distinct people, now called the St. Lawrence Iroquoians, inhabited the areas along the St. Lawrence River from before 1300 until the late 16th century. By the late 16th century, the St. Lawrence Iroquoians had disappeared from the St. Lawrence Valley, probably due to warfare by the Mohawk of the Haudenosaunee over the fur trade. By the time of later French contact, the Five Nations of the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;: Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, and Seneca, were allied in the Iroquois Confederacy, based in present-day New York. Onondaga settlements extended up along the south shore of Lake Ontario. Both the Huron and Mohawk used the St. Lawrence Valley for hunting grounds and as a path for war parties.

The earliest European settlement in the area was a French mission named Fort de La Présentation (Fort of the Presentation), built by Abbé Picquet in 1749 as part of the colony of New France. The mission attracted Native Americans for the fur trade, many of whom settled in the village and converted to Catholicism. Mostly Onondaga, the converted Iroquois at the mission became known to the French as Oswegatchie after their transliterated name for the river. By 1755, there were 3,000 Iroquois living at the mission settlement. The Oswegatchie became known as one of the Seven Nations of Canada. The residents were hostile to the encroachments of British colonists on their territory. During the 1750s and the French and Indian War, warriors from this fort allied with French officers in attacking British colonists in the Champlain, Mohawk and Ohio valleys.

The city is near the site of the 1760 Battle of the Thousand Islands between British and French forces during the Seven Years&#x27; War (known in the later United States as the French and Indian War.) After the British victory in the war, France ceded its land in Canada and east of the Mississippi to England. The English renamed this installation as Fort Oswegatchie, after the native name for the river. As with the other mission settlements, the British did not disturb the relationship of the Oswegatchie, as they called the native people, and their Catholic priests. The British considered this community part of Lower Canada or Quebec province. The village remained under British rule until 1796 following the American Revolutionary War. With the northern border redefined by Jay&#x27;s Treaty, the settlement became part of United States territory.

The first settlers under an American flag arrived that year in 1796. American settlers essentially drove the Oswegatchie, former British allies, out of the area; many went to Akwesasne or other Mohawk reserves in Canada. New American residents named the village Ogdensburgh after Samuel Ogden, an early landowner. The community developed around this early settlement, which was designated the county seat from 1802 to 1828. During the War of 1812, the city was captured by British forces to end the partial blockade on the St. Lawrence River and harassment that had been conducted from the community. In the absence of US troops, the local merchants restored an extensive trade with Canadian towns across the river.

The community was incorporated as a village in 1817 and chartered as the City of Ogdensburg in 1868. This post US Civil war period saw Ogdensburg as a location of Fenian activity, Thomas Miller Beach spent some time in fall of 1868 in the city in his activities with the Fenian Brotherhood. 

In 1940, the town was the site of the signing of the Ogdensburg Agreement between Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King and United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt. This renewed the ties between the two countries after the 1939 outbreak of World War II in Europe. The celebrated German POW Franz von Werra escaped from Canada to Ogdensburg in a rowboat.

==Sports==
Ogdensburg hosted various minor league baseball teams between 1900 and 1951. Ogdensburg (1900–1901), the Ogdensburg Colts (1936–1939), Ottawa-Ogdensburg Senators (1940) and Ogdensburg Maples (1946–1951) played as members of the Northern New York League (1900–1901), Canadian–American League (1936–1940) and Border League (1946–1951). Ogdensburg was an affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies (1940) and New York Giants (1948). Teams played at Winter Park

==Resources==
Ogdensburg is home to the St. Lawrence Psychiatric Center, a mental health service provider offering both inpatient and outpatient services. The SLPC is part of the New York State Office of Mental Health (OMH) and serves the general public.

The city is the site of the Frederic Remington Art Museum. The downtown museum is housed in the former family mansion of local industrialist David Parish on Washington Street. While the house was always called the Parish Mansion, Eva Remington lived there as a widow after the death of her husband Frederic Remington. He was notable for his paintings of the American West. The collection of Remington art and memorabilia is based on items from the estates of Eva Remington and her sister Emma.

Ogdensburg is the site of two correctional facilities: Riverview and Ogdensburg, run by the New York State Department of Correctional Services One is located on the grounds of the former St. Lawrence Psychiatric Center. The other was built directly across New York State Route 37.

==Transportation==
Beginning in the mid-19th century, Ogdensburg expanded on its role as a port city on the St. Lawrence River, becoming an important trading city and station as railroads were developed in northern New York and southeastern Canada. The Ogdensburg &amp; Lake Champlain Railroad (later Rutland Railroad) (1849), Rome, Watertown &amp; Ogdensburg Railroad (1853) and Portland &amp; Ogdensburg Railway (never completed), all constructed lines through the area connecting the historic towns. In time, the RW&amp;O was bought out by the New York Central Railroad. That passenger rail service ended in 1961.

The Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge was built in 1960, connecting Ogdensburg and Johnstown, Ontario. The roadways are NY 812 and ON 16, the latter a direct route to Ottawa, the capital of Canada. On the United States side, Ogdensburg is not connected directly to the interstate highway system. The border crossing has unused capacity on the bridge; although it has considerable truck traffic, volume is about one-tenth of that on the Thousand Islands Bridge.

Ogdensburg International Airport is located south of the city.

<doc id="127217" wikidata="Q3708404" url="?curid=127217" title="Greenwood, New York">
<text>Greenwood is a town in Steuben County, New York, United States. The population was 771 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

A pioneer road was cut through the town in the 18th century, but no settlers remained in the town. The first permanent settlers arrived around 1820. Salt production was an early industry. The main industry today is deer hunting, for which the town claims to be the top deer-take town in New York State.

Greenwood was formed in 1827 from the towns of Canisteo and Troupsburg. Part of Greenwood was used to form the Town of West Union in 1845, but territory was regained from the Town of Jasper in 1848.

From November 16, 1896, through June 1936, Greenwood was served by the New York &amp; Pennsylvania Railway (and predecessors) as part of its Canisteo NY to Ceres NY (via Greenwood NY, Genesee PA, Oswayo and Shinglehouse PA) main line. Following severe floods in July 1935 the railroad was partially out of service and its abandonment in June 1936 was readily approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission which from an early date approved railroad abandonment to promote highway truck use. The loss of railroad service did much to promote the economic withering of the Greenwood area.

By the early 20th century, agriculture had established itself as the primary economic activity in the town. Farming has since declined significantly, as in many parts of rural America, and forest cover has largely returned to many areas.

Also contributing to Greenwood&#x27;s decline was the decision, when the Southern Tier Expressway (New York Route 17, now Interstate 86) was being planned in the 1960s, to route the road through the Hornell-Arkport area, as it was considered to have more potential for development than Jasper-Greenwood. The former road is now New York Route 417.

In 1967, Harold Mason, a librarian and antiquarian bookseller, founded (in Greenwood) the Greenwood Press, specializing in the reprinting of out-of-print books. The company was sold in 1969, and Mason left it in 1973. It is now the Greenwood Publishing Group, part of ABC-CLIO/Greenwood. It has had no connection with the town of Greenwood since the 1970s.

In 2004, Greenwood&#x27;s schools merged with the larger, adjacent Canisteo school system.

<text>Hammondsport is a village in Steuben County, New York, United States. First settled in 1792 the village is located at the south end of Keuka Lake, one of the Finger Lakes. Beginning in the 1790s the village began to take form, which included a courthouse and a jail. In the 1850s vineyards and the wine industry began to emerge in and around Hammondsport. Pioneer aviation engineer and pilot Glenn Curtiss was born in Hammondsport, where he built several types of aircraft, and the first seaplanes, which were tested in Keuka Lake. Hammondsport features a village square, historic buildings, wineries, breweries and museums. Nearby municipalities contain vineyards, and wineries and grape-packing have played a major role in the economy. In 1935, heavy rains lasting three days resulted in mudslides and major flooding, ruining or damaging many homes and structures in Hammondsport, situated at the hillside. A number of buildings surrounding Pulteney Square make up the Pulteney Square Historic District and are listed in the National Register of Historic Places

==History==
Hammondsport was settled beginning in 1792 by Samuel Baker, Mr. Aulls and Capt. Amos Stone, and was originally called &quot;Cold Spring Valley&quot;, due to its icy-cold spring that emptied into Keuka Lake (then called &quot;Crooked Lake&quot;) It was also known as Pleasant Valley.

In 1802, General George McClure purchased several hundred acres of land in Pleasant Valley just south of Hammondsp[ort where he built a saw mill, fulling mill, flour mill and carding machine. During this time he opened a store on the site of Hammondsport, which sold goods produced by the mills, thus laying the foundation for future business there. The village was later renamed for Lazerus Hammond, a settler who arrived in 1810 from nearby Dansville. The first building constructed in the valley is still standing. Hammond officially founded the village around 1826, and it was incorporated in 1856. William Hastings, a member of the Presbyterian church, erected the first store, and started a mercantile business. The village became a center for the New York wine industry.

In 1825 the first Christian religious service was held in Hammondsport by Episcopal Reverend Bostwick, who organized the Episcopal Church Society in Hammondsport and resided in a rectory there. In July 1831, Reverend Isaac Flagler, a Presbyterian, arrived and began religious services. On July 25, a Presbyterian religious society was established, and on September 14 a Presbyterian church, consisting of eight members, was organized, by a committee from the Presbyterian church in Bath, consisting of Reverend Isaac W. Piatt, Reverend Samuel White, with the assistance of two elders. During the 1830s other preachers began arriving and established other churches in Hammondsport, receiving financial assistance and guidance from the American Home Missionary Society.

===Wine industry===
Reverend Bostwick planted the first grapevines in a garden at his rectory in 1830. He soon discovered that the surrounding region would be ideal for growing imported grape vines and planted the first vines in the slopes around Keuka Lake, which established the wine country and its subsequent wine industry in the western Finger Lakes region. The first townspeople to take vine cuttings from Bostwick&#x27;s vines were John Poppino, Lemuel Hastings and George McClure. Beginning with Andrew Swartout in 1852, grapes from vineyards around the lake were being shipped by boat to Hammondsport, then by wagons, and then by the Bath &amp; Hammondsport Railroad to where it connected to the Erie Railroad at the Bath railroad station and transported to New York. Subsequently, the demand for fresh grapes in New York increased dramatically, which in turn greatly promoted the wine industry in and around Hammondsport. After the flood of 1935 the Bath &amp; Hammondsport Railroad was purchased by local interests and renamed the B &amp; H Railroad. The railroad remained in operation for 120 years. By 1870, Hammondsport had 3000 acres of vineyards; by 1879, 5000 acres; and by 1889, 14,500 acres. Subsequently, Hammondsport is considered the heart of the grape-growing region in New York.

The Crooked Lake Canal, after much deliberation with state officials, and labor disputes, was completed in three years and opened in 1833, connecting Hammondsport and the Town of Urbana to the Erie Canal. At a width of 42 feet, the canal was built to accommodate the same size boats in use on the Erie Canal. With access via the Seneca Canal to the Erie Canal, which led to the Hudson River, it became possible to ship goods between Hammondsport and New York City by boat. When the Bath and Hammondsport railroad opened in 1874 the canal became obsolete. Subsequently, the canal was financially forced to close in 1877.

===Village life===

The first school-house to appear in Hammondsport was built in 1827 at the location where the St. James (Episcopal) Church exists today. In 1858 a private academy opened in a stone building at the corner of Main and Lake Streets in Hammondsport. The structure was later purchased by the Hammondsport school district around the beginning of the 20th century. Later additions were added to the building on both sides, and thereafter it continued to serve as the Hammondsport school until 1935.

In 1836 Mallory Mill was built by Meridith Mallory on Pulteney Street in Hammondsport. Four stories in height, the stone structure was the second largest free-standing building in New York. It had three water wheels used to power a grist mill. During the winter months, however, operations at the mill stopped due to the freezing water. Subsequently, its life as a grist mill was short lived and after 1840 it was used as a warehouse until 1880 when it was used as a winery by the Glen Wine Company. In 1901 William H. Hallock, owner of the Hallock Bank in Bath, acquired the property. The structure is listed in U.S. National Register of Historic Places 

Among the first physicians to practice medicine in Hammondsport were Dr. Ezekiel B. Pulling, Dr. Amasa Church, Dr. C. E. Campbell, Dr. Moses T. Babcock, and Dr. Oliver H. Babeock. Among the first lawyers to live and practice in the village, were Benjamin Bennitt, Benjamin F. Drew, and Monroe Wheeler, Esqs. The first election of village officers was held November 22, 1856, which included William Hastings as senior trustee, and Orlando Shepard, as the town assessor.

The &quot;Hamondsport Advertiser&quot;, first published in 1838, and the &quot;Hammondsport Herald&quot;, first published in 1874, were Hammondsport&#x27;s first newspapers. In 1931 the Hammondsport newspaper, the &quot;Keuka Grape Belt&quot;, combined with the &quot;Hammondsport Herald&quot; and &quot;Bath Plaindealer&quot;, and operated from 1931 to 1940. Published by the Keuka Grape Belt Co., its circulation served Hammondsport and Steuben County.
In 1895 the Saint James Episcopal Church was built. it was the third church, replacing the Episcopal churches that were built in 1833 and 1877. The cornerstone contains documents, including photographs and an 1886 Prayer Book formerly in the cornerstone of the second building.

Beginning in 1894 Hammondsport received its first water system from springs that were contained in the Rufus Scofield farm, on Mt. Washington, not far from the village. Aside from supplying the village with pure spring water, one of the first objectives was to install five fire hydrants at convenient locations about the village. Pressure from the water system came from the gravitational force and the high altitude of the springs.The water system plant was completed in 1865 costing about $25,000, paid for and owned by the village of Hammondsport.

In 1917, the first telephone office was built in Hammondsport which was needed to accommodate the Curtiss Manufacturing Company with its many business involvements.

===Steamboats===
Hammondsport, on the shore of Keuka Lake, had several docks that accommodated lake-faring vessels that were typically used for trading and ferrying, transporting people and goods between Hammondsport and Penn Yan. The first vessel to set upon the waters of Keuka Lake was a schooner called &quot;The Sally&quot;, built in 1808 at Hammondsport by George McClure for the purpose of transporting wheat and other goods from Penn Yan to Hammondsport, where it would be shipped to market in New York. McClure played a fundamental role in Hammondsport&#x27;s business development. When steam power came into common use there were several steamboats running on Keuka Lake in 1835. The first built was called the &quot;Keuka Maid&quot;, a sidewheeler of 85 feet in length. In the latter half of the 1800s Hammondsport became the home to various steamboat manufacturers which included A. W. Springstead and the Union Dry Dock Company. In 1892 the Dry Dock company built the &quot;Mary Bell&quot;, considered &quot;The Queen of Lake Keuka&quot;, which was the largest steamboat ever to operate on the lake. Some steamboats met an unusual fate while docked at Hammondsport. The &quot;Steuben&quot; sank while docked there from a hull that developed leaks due to engine vibration. In 1909 the &quot;Cricket&quot; caught fire and was damaged beyond repair while docked at Hammondsport. By 1921, with the increased use of gasoline powered trucks and cars, large boat traffic on the lake was no longer economically feasible: The &quot;Mary Bell&quot; was the last large vessel to make the run between Hammondsport and Penn Yan on opposite ends of the lake.

In the 1850s the farming industry began to decline when the Erie Railroad came through the area, which subsequently reduced lake traffic. During this time, however, viticulture began to materialize as a new and promising industry, as the temperate climate and well-drained soil along the shores of the lake were ideal for growing grapes. Charles Champlin&#x27;s Pleasant Valley Wine Company was the first vineyard established in the Hammondsport area, which was followed by Walter Taylor&#x27;s vineyard, and others. Winemakers from France, including Jules D. Masson, who introduced new varieties of grapes from that country. The Bath and Hammondsport Railroad soon emerged, which connected to the Erie Railroad in Bath eight miles south of Hammondsport, which brought in more people and business to Hammondsport.
===Civil War===
During the American Civil War, with President Lincoln calling for 300,000 volunteers, the 107th New York Infantry Regiment (nicknamed the Campbell Guards), was mustered. Young men from Hammondsport, Bath and Elimra who volunteered for service were assigned to Company G of the regiment which was organized in Elmira, NY. The regiment was mustered into service for three years and left the state to serve on August 13, 1862.

Morris Brown, Jr., a once Hammondsport resident, received the Medal of Honor posthumously on March 6, 1869, for his service in the Union Army at the Battle of Gettysburg, where he daringly captured the Confederate flag. He died in action almost a year later in Virginia. Brown, Jr. was interred at Lakeview Cemetery in Penn Yan at the northern end of Keuka Lake.

===Early 20th century===
By the time World War I began in 1914 the village of Hammondsport included twelve wineries, five grape-packing houses, one barrel making factory, four hotels, five grocery stores, five meat markets, three blacksmiths, two livery stables, five barber shops, three pool halls, three movie houses, two men&#x27;s clothing stores, three hat shops, three lumber yards, four coal yards, a grist mill, three doctors, two dentists, three lawyers, a chiropractor and a veterinarian and a harness shop, along with the airplane works at the Glenn Curtiss Company.

In 1921, five local men purchased a wood barrel factory just south of the present D.W. Putnam Wine Company, and named it the Aerial Service Corporation. Two of these men, Henry Kleckler, the president and William Chadeayne, vice president, were formerly with the Curtiss Aeroplane Company, known as the Mercury Corporation, established in Hammondsport in 1920.

As the greater part of Hammondsport&#x27;s economy was dependent on its wineries, the effects of the prohibition from 1919 to 1933 forced many wineries to stop operations, resulting in an overall decline in the wine industry and subsequent unemployment in Hammondsport, which in turn all but closed down the Bath &amp; Hammondsport Railroad, which for years had routinely transported large cargoes of wine and grapes from Hammondsport to other towns.

===Aviation development===

Hammondsport was at the center of aviation development during the first years of the 20th century. The Reverend Claudius G. Curtiss, a Methodist minister, arrived at Hammondsport in 1876. He was the grandfather of Glenn Hammond Curtiss, the airplane designer who first developed aircraft capable of taking off and landing in water, who resided at Hammondsport, where he was born in 1878. At this time the population of Hammondsport was almost 1000 people.

Not long after his father died Curtiss married Lena Pearl Neff in the Hammondsport Presbyterian Church. In a vacant storefront owned by Mrs. Benjamin Bennett, co-founder of the Hammondsport Herald, he opened up a bicycle shop across from the bandstand on Pulteney Square, which soon grew into a successful business. Here he developed his own gasoline engine which he later produced in the Curtis Manufacturing Company (CMC) in Hammondsport. Its great success and national notoriety is said to have &quot;put Hammondsport on the map&quot;. Later Glenn became a motorcycle and aircraft designer and manufacturer in Hammondsport, and became a recognized expert on gasoline engines. Curtiss&#x27; first involvement with aeronautics occurred in 1904, with his association with Thomas Baldwin, a pioneer balloonist, when Curtiss sold him a motorcycle engine to power his balloon. Together they built a large building on Kingsley Flats, a low-lying area between the village and the lake and began manufacturing balloons and dirigibles at Hammondsport.

Early development of aircraft and seaplanes was carried out by Curtiss in his factory at Hammondsport, and who later had joined with Alexander Graham Bell and others in the Aerial Experiment Association. On July 4, 1908, the &quot;June Bug&quot;, was the first American airplane to fly at least 1 km and was flown by Curtiss from the Hammondsport airfield. The &quot;June Bug&quot; was later fitted with pontoons and became the first aircraft to perform takeoffs and landings on the water. Hammondsport at Keuka Lake was the site where the first successful flight of a &quot;flying boat&quot; took place in July 1912. The first long distance &quot;flying boat&quot;, the &quot;America&quot;, was also designed by Curtiss and launched in Keuka Lake at Hammondsport in 1914, while the people of Hammondsport and the press gathered to witness the landmark event. This aircraft was again flown by Captain Jim Poel, and co-pilot, Lee Sackett, over Keuka Lake during an exhibition at Hammondsport in 2008 and again in 2009. In 1911 Curtiss founded the first flying school in America at Hammondsport. Here he taught Blanche Stuart Scott how to operate an airplane, who became America&#x27;s first female pilot. During this time Scott resided in Hammondsport at the home of Curtiss and his family. Worlf War I flying ace, William Thaw, credited with five confirmed and two unconfirmed aerial victories, also attended the Curtiss flying school.

In 1914 another aviation pioneer, Samuel Langley, brought his plane to Hammondsport to be reconditioned by Curtis and flown in a scientific demonstration After a long and distinguished career in avionics Curtiss died unexpectedly in 1930 at the relatively early age of 52. His subsequent funeral service was held in Hammondsport at St. James Episcopal Church, with his interment in the family plot at Pleasant Valley Cemetery, just south of Hammondsport in Urbana. Today the Glenn H. Curtiss Museum, located less than a mile south of Hammondsport on State Road, Rt. 54, houses many examples of Curtiss&#x27; airplanes and other inventions.

Henry Kleckler, was the shop foreman at Curtiss&#x27; airplane manufacturing works (CMC) in Hammondsport. Curtiss considered Kleckler his &quot;right hand man&quot;, and a &quot;master innovator and mechanic&quot; He was also a native of Hammondsport and worked with Curtiss in developing more efficient engines for the &quot;flying boats&quot; pioneered and developed by Curtiss.

On May 19, 1908, Thomas Selfridge, while working with Curtiss in Hammondsport, became the first US military officer to pilot a modern aircraft, when he flew solo in the Aerial Experiment Association&#x27;s newest aircraft, &quot;White Wing&quot;, off shore from the village in Keuka Lake. In September of that year, while conducting flying experiments with Orville Wright in Virginia, he was the first member of the military to die in a plane crash.

===Flood of 1935===
Heavy rains in July 1935 caused flooding and damage across much of southern-central New York. With more than of rain in a 48-hour period, the village of Hammondsport was among those that were subjected to wide spread damage and ruin. During the prolonged heavy rains much water had drained off the adjacent hills and funneled through Glen Brook, which at its end runs parallel between the hillside and Hammondsport before reachingf Keuka Lake. The torrents of water coming down through the brook at Hammondsport caused the stone retaining walls to give way, allowing the rushing waters to gouge a channel through some of the dirt roads in the village. The flood killed seven people, five of them children. Among the ruin caused to houses and other structures, the flood also destroyed an old warehouse in the glen that housed the Georges Roulet Winnery, thereby flushing out several hundred barrels of aging brandy into the streets of Hammondsport that were previously stored in the winery during the prohibition years. Great amounts of mud was also deposited on many of the streets, and buried a number of cars, while the railroad line from Bath to Hammondsport was almost completely destroyed. Not long after the flood, the stone walls along Glen Brook in Hammondsport were widened and reinforced with concrete so as withstand heavy rain runoff from the hillside and channel any future flood waters to the lake.

<text>Hornell is a city in Steuben County, New York, United States. The population was 8,259 at the 2020 census. The city is named after the Hornell family, early settlers.

The City of Hornell is surrounded by Town of Hornellsville. Hornell is about south of Rochester and is near the western edge of Steuben County.

Hornell is nicknamed the &quot;Maple City&quot; after the large maple trees that once grew throughout the town and covered the surrounding hills of the Canisteo Valley. Hornell residents celebrate with one of the largest Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parades and celebrations in the area, bringing many out to welcome spring and show their green.

== History ==

What is now Hornell was first settled in 1790 under the name &quot;Upper Canisteo&quot;, to distinguish it from the community of Canisteo, then known as &quot;Lower Canisteo&quot;. The family of Benjamin Crosby were the first settlers in what is now Hornell. The area was incorporated as a town in 1820, as &quot;Hornellsville.&quot; The name comes from early settler George Hornell Jr, who built the first gristmill here. 

The City of Hornell was chartered in 1888 as the &quot;City of Hornellsville,&quot; (having been first organized as the &quot;Village of Hornellsville&quot; in 1852). The name was changed to Hornell in 1906.

Major flooding in 1936 put parts of the city under water, prompting the creation of a system of levees to prevent future serious flooding issues.

The former city park, Union Park, was destroyed by the highway construction of the 1970s.

In 1950, Hornell had a population just above 15,000 people. It had two radio stations, WWHG and WLEA, and three movie theaters - the &quot;Steuben&quot; and the &quot;Majestic&quot; were located on Broadway, the &quot;Hornell&quot; on Main Street.

The current mayor of Hornell is Republican John Buckley.

The Hornell Armory, Hornell Public Library, Adsit House, Lincoln School, St. Ann&#x27;s Federation Building, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Railroads and Hornell ==
Hornell had four rail lines, though the companies operating the railroads often changed names, routes, and ownership:
* The main Erie Railroad line, connecting New York City (terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey) and Dunkirk, New York.
* Erie&#x27;s Buffalo line. This began as the Attica and Hornellsville Railroad (1845–1851), which became part of the Buffalo and New York City Railroad, which extended the line to Buffalo and operated it from 1852 to 1861, when it was acquired by Erie. Hornell was the junction and transfer point for the two main branches of the Erie.
* A line running to the northeast, from a separate depot on Seneca St. near Adsit, connecting Hornell via Wayland with Geneva. The company was the Geneva Southwestern and Hornellsville Railway (1872–1875), then the Geneva and Hornellsville Railway (1875–1876), and the Geneva, Hornellsville and Pine Creek Railway (1876–1879), and the Rochester, Hornellsville and Lackawanna Railroad (1886–1889), then the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western, or Lackawanna for short. Later the Pittsburg, Shawmut and Northern Railroad ran on this route one train in each direction per day, connecting Hornell with Angelica to the west and Wayland to the north.
* The Hornellsville Electric Railway Company and Hornellsville &amp; Canisteo Railway Company, consolidated in 1909 as the Hornell Traction Company, provided service to North Hornell, Canisteo, and within the city, linking the Lackawanna and Erie depots, from 1892 until 1926.

Some grading was done in 1872–1873 for a proposed but unbuilt Rochester, Hornellsville, and Pine Creek railroad.

The most important railroad in Hornell was the New York and Erie Railroad, or Erie for short. It arrived in Hornell in 1850 and began public service on May 14, 1851. President Millard Fillmore, himself a native of western New York, and Secretary of State Daniel Webster rode through Hornell on the inaugural train.

Hornell was a central location on the Erie, making it a favorable location for the railroad&#x27;s repair yards. According to an 1882 traveler&#x27;s guide to the Erie Railroad, in Hornell &quot;There are an immense amount of side-tracks, ample engine-houses, repair-shops, and other railroad structures, as the village is the dividing-point of the Susquehanna and Western Divisions, and the point of junction of the Buffalo Division of the Erie Railway... It has banks, newspapers, a nourishing library association, which maintains a course of popular lectures, and is one of the most efficient and attractive institutions of the kind in the interior of the State. There are churches of various denominations, and a population of about 9,000. The cars destined for Buffalo, Niagara Falls, etc., are here detached from those going west via Salamanca or Dunkirk. At the station is a spacious dining-saloon, where meals are served to travelers at regular hours.&quot;

In 1895 the Erie constructed &quot;at the foot of Pine Street...an immense stock barn&quot; for the large number of cattle being shipped east on its trains.

=== Hornell during the railroad period (1860–1960) ===
For the next hundred years Hornell enjoyed prosperity, with its steam engine shop doing the repairs for the entire Erie line. The most important point in town was the train station, which survives and since 2005 houses the Hornell Erie Depot Museum. Next to it were the police station and fire department, at the beginning of Broadway, a wide street with stores, a luncheonette, and the Steuben and Majestic Theaters. Heading south, Broadway ended at Canisteo Street just before it passed under the tracks, a route served for some decades by the Hornell Traction Company. The underpass was closed, save for a pedestrian passage, when the Route 36 arterial was built.

At the five-way intersection just north of the underpass, where Broadway began, Canisteo Street ran northwestward. Near its southern end (now covered by the Route 36 arterial), was Hornell&#x27;s largest hotel, the New Sherwood, the offices of the Hornell Evening Tribune and above it those of its radio station WWHG. On the east side was a storefront Greyhound station (service Elmira – Corning – Bath – Hornell – Batavia – Buffalo, no direct service to Rochester); on the west side was Hornell&#x27;s main park, Union Park, destroyed by the Hornell Arterial, with the city&#x27;s high school (middle school after new high school built), containing the city&#x27;s largest auditorium, and other businesses. Main Street, with the Hornell Theater, WLEA&#x27;s studios, Koskie&#x27;s music store, and other businesses, connected the two now-separated streets (Broadway and Canisteo/Seneca). Main St. extended east to Hornell&#x27;s Carnegie Library (the Hornell Public Library), Hornell&#x27;s largest grocery store, Loblaw&#x27;s, the YMCA, with the only public swimming pool in the city, various medical and dental offices, and finally (turning south and crossing the Canisteo River), the Erie repair shops. North of Main Street the downtown area extended another block with the city&#x27;s pharmacy, Jacobson&#x27;s, a shoe store, the United States Post Office (all now [2009] vacant), and the Steuben Trust Company (bank). In the block north of Main Street, Church Street had Hornell&#x27;s synagogue, Temple Beth-El (closed), and at the intersection with Genesee Street four churches, one on each corner; two survive today (2017). Further north on Seneca Street were Hornell&#x27;s best restaurant, The Big Elms, Hornell&#x27;s baseball field (from 1942 to 1957 Hornell had a minor-league team), and car dealers. The current high school is adjacent to the baseball field. The city ended at the Canisteo River, where a bridge led to the village of North Hornell.

Yet things were not idyllic in Hornell. In 1922, after a recruitment talk by &quot;KKK organizer C. S. Fowler... at the local Grand Army of the Republic hall, the Klan announced its existence by igniting a huge cross on the side of a mountain, a demonstration evidently intended to intimidate the community&#x27;s sizable immigrant population.&quot;

=== Hornell in the post-railroad period (1960–present) ===
Hornell has struggled to regain its former prosperity. The population is half what it was in 1960, and still declining. Passenger service, in severe decline, ended completely by 1970. (The former station has been refurbished and, since 2006, is the Hornell Erie Depot Museum.) The railroad came upon further hard times as trucking picked up more and more of the freight business. In October 1960, the Erie merged with the Lackawanna to form the Erie Lackawanna. Diesel engines, replacing older steam engines, required less maintenance; consequently, many of the staff were laid off. The Erie Accounting Office, in Hornell, was closed and its work transferred to the Lackawanna headquarters in Scranton, Pennsylvania. In 1972, flooding from Hurricane Agnes destroyed about of roadbed along the Canisteo River, removing all hope of reoperating the railroad line southeast of Hornell. The Erie Lackawanna filed for bankruptcy soon after.

The former Erie repair shops were completely closed for years. They were later reopened to service EMD diesels and perform bodywork and painting. Yet later, they were operated by General Electric for a short time, followed by Morrison-Knudsen.

Today, the Hornell shops are a major employer, serving as Alstom&#x27;s main North American assembly and manufacturing site, at which AC traction motors, railway cars, and passenger locomotives are produced. Car bodies are shipped disassembled from São Paulo, Brazil, and assembled in Hornell. Alstom won a contract worth $194 million to completely overhaul PATCO Speedline&#x27;s light rail fleet, beginning in 2011. In 2013, the facility was contracted to build 34 light rail vehicles for OC Transpo. In 2020, the plant began production of Amtrak&#x27;s second generation Acela high-speed trains. In January 2021, the plant won a $1.8bn contract to build new passenger railcars for Metra, which is expected to create 250 additional jobs.

==Highway construction==

===Route 36 Arterial===
Hornell&#x27;s central layout changed significantly when the New York Route 36 arterial was built about 1972. Prior to that, Route 36, Hornell&#x27;s main north–south highway, was routed along Seneca Street (to the north) and Canisteo Street (to the south). Neither of these streets were adequate for the increased automobile and truck traffic which accompanied the decline of the railroad, and they could not be easily expanded. Canisteo Street also had a significant bottleneck (originally the &quot;Canisteo Subway&quot; on the Hornell-Canisteo trolley, pictured on a postcard, above) where the route went under the Erie Railroad tracks, just south of downtown. Route 36 between Hornell and Canisteo, also inadequate, could not be expanded due to the adjacent Canisteo River.

The decision was made to replace the route with an arterial, west of Seneca Street on the north side, crossing the downtown and exiting Hornell east of Canisteo Street on the south side. &quot;The highway required the demolition of 245 houses and many commercial buildings, split the city in half, and sacrificed Hornell&#x27;s Union Park.&quot; The four-lane route was continued to Canisteo. Unconnected fragments of the former Route 36 from Hornell to Canisteo survive; in Hornell it starts from East Avenue, east of the river, and heading north from the Village of Canisteo it is today Dineen/McBurney Road.

The impact of the relocation of Route 36 on central Hornell was profound. Much of the south end of the downtown was destroyed, either physically or economically. Seneca Street and Broadway, formerly important commercial streets, became deserted side streets. (See United States Post Office (Hornell, New York).) It is not fondly remembered, and it was something wanted by the trucking industry and its customers, not the local working class.

===The Southern Tier Expressway (New York Route 17, now Interstate 86)===
When the decision was made in the 1960s to upgrade the western portion of New York Route 17 to expressway status, it was decided to route the expressway through the Hornell area, as it was considered to have more prospects for development than Greenwood and Jasper, along the old route (now New York Route 417). Interstate 86 begins (or ends) in Pennsylvania, running from I-90 near Erie, Pennsylvania, across New York&#x27;s Southern Tier to Windsor, NY. It crosses New York State Route 36 between Hornell and Arkport. It is today (2023) Hornell&#x27;s main highway.

<doc id="127227" wikidata="Q3452798" url="?curid=127227" title="Painted Post, New York">
<text>Painted Post is a village in Steuben County, New York. The village is in the town of Erwin, west of the city of Corning. The population was 1,809 at the 2010 census. The name comes from a Seneca carved post found by explorers at the junction of three local rivers. 
Corning-Painted Post Airport (7N1) is west of the village.

The former town of Painted Post was in 1836 renamed the town of Corning.
== History ==
The Senecas never had a painted post but rather the post that existed in the Painted Post area was not &quot;painted&quot;. The plain post had been used as a type of bulletin board and when the white settlers moved into the area they painted it. To paint this post was desecration to the Seneca people. The Seneca language word for the area was TKäen DōD, meaning &quot;land of the post&quot;.

According to village records, Painted Post was established as a village in 1803. The Erwin brothers are considered the first wealthy European descended settlers to have settled in the Painted Post area in the late 18th century (Painted Post village is in the town of Erwin, named for the brothers and incorporated in 1796). The brothers&#x27; 4 mansions are still standing. There are maps in existence dated 1796 which include Painted Post. The village was first incorporated in 1860 and officially re-incorporated in 1893. The name is derived from a historic, although probably unpainted, wooden post seen in the area at the end of the 18th century. The origin and purpose of the post remain controversial. A glyph of the post is visible on the aforementioned 1796 map.

The following footnote appears in French&#x27;s Gazetteer of New York State and gives two possible versions of the origin of the name:

In the summer of 1779, a party of tories and Indians, under the command of a loyalist named McDonald, returned from an incursion into the Susquehanna settlements, bringing with them many of their number wounded. At the confluence of Tioga and Conhocton Rivers, Captain Montour, son of the famous Queen Catharine, a Seneca chief of great promise, died of his wounds. &quot;His comrades buried him by the riverside, and planted above his grave a post on which were painted various symbols and rude devices. This monument was known throughout the Genesee Forests as &#x27;The Painted Post.&#x27; It was a landmark well known to all the Six Nations, and was often visited by their braves and chieftains.&quot; This account of the origin of the Painted Post was given to Benj. Patterson, the hunter, by a man named Taggart, who was carried to Fort Niagara a prisoner by McDonald&#x27;s party, end was a witness of the burial of Capt. Montour, or at least was in the encampment at the mouth of the Tioga at the time of his death. Col. Harper, of Harpersfield, the well known officer of the frontier militia of New York in the Revolution, informed Judge Knox, of Knoxville, in this co., that the Painted Post was erected over the grave of a chief who was wounded at the battle of the &quot;Hog-Back&quot; and brought in a canoe to the head of the Chemung, where he died. It was well understood by the early settlers that this monument was erected in memory of some distinguished warrior who had been wounded in one of the border battles of the Revolution and afterward died at this place. The post stood for many years after the settlement of the co.; and the story goes that it rotted down at the butt, and was preserved in the bar-room of a tavern till about the year 1810 and then mysteriously disappeared. It is also said to have been swept away in a freshet. — McMasters&#x27;s Hist, of Steuben. Simm&#x27;s Hist, Schoharie, p. 333.

In June 1972 the remnants of Hurricane Agnes stalled over the New York–Pennsylvania border, dropping up to 20 inches (500 mm) of rain into the Chemung Valley, which was among the worst hit areas by the resultant flooding. The Chemung, Tioga, and Cohocton rivers all overflowed their banks, leaving widespread areas of Painted Post as well as Corning, Big Flats, and Elmira under water and destroying many bridges.

Painted Post is featured in the Stephen Vincent Benét poem &quot;American Names&quot;.

The First Baptist Church of Painted Post, Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad Station, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Painted Post post office contains a mural, &quot;Recording the Victory&quot;, painted by muralist Amy Jones in 1939. Federally-commissioned murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department.

<text>Wayne is a town located in the northeast corner of Steuben County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 1,006. The town was named after the Revolutionary War general, Anthony Wayne.

The Town of Wayne is northeast of Bath.

==History==

The region was first settled by Europeans &quot;circa&quot; 1791 by Abraham Hendricks, and it was organized as the &quot;Town of Frederickstown&quot; on May 18, 1796, when the County of Steuben was formed from a part of the larger Ontario County. Early settlers include Ephriam Sanford, Anthony Swarthout, Jabez Hopkins, and Joseph Bailey.

The town changed its name to &quot;Wayne&quot; on April 6, 1808, in honor of the Revolutionary War hero, General Anthony Wayne, and included what is now the smaller hamlet of Wayne, New York. Afterwards, the town was substantially reduced in size by the formation of other towns, including Reading (1806), Orange (1813) and Barrington, and Tyrone (1822). In 1854, the size of the township was again reduced by moving a parcel of land to the town of Tyrone, which included a large portion of the hamlet of Wayne. Also, a former hamlet in the township, further south, was known as &quot;Wayne Four Corners&quot;.

=== Famous natives and locations in Wayne ===
Wayne native Jonathan Goble is said to have invented the rickshaw in 1859. He was a Marine who traveled with Commodore Matthew Perry&#x27;s squadron which opened Japan to western trade. He later returned as a Baptist missionary and was inspired to invent the rickshaw in order to transport his invalid wife around the streets of Tokyo.

Francis M. McDowell, one of the seven founders of the National Grange and its treasurer for 21 years was born in Wayne, NY. In the 1860s, he returned to Wayne to grow grapes on the shores of Lake Keuka. He was also involved with his brother-in-law Samuel Hallett, in several enterprises. Samuel Hallett is known for building the largest home in Wayne, known as the &quot;Aisle of Pines&quot;. It was a 20-column mansion, built in 1854, but it burned to the ground in 1974.

A famous landmark in the township was the Keuka Hotel, built in 1895 on the shores of Lake Keuka. Hoagy Carmichael was the pianist and vocalist at the hotel for two seasons, and local legend has it that his 1927 hit song &quot;Stardust&quot; was written while at the Keuka hotel.

<text>Amagansett is a census-designated place that roughly corresponds to the hamlet by the same name in the Town of East Hampton in Suffolk County, New York, United States, on the South Shore of Long Island. As of the 2010 United States Census, the CDP population was 1,165. Amagansett hamlet was founded in 1680.

==History==
Amagansett derives its name from the Montaukett for &quot;place of good water&quot;—from a water source near what today is Indian Wells beach.

Unlike the rest of the Hamptons, Amagansett was initially settled by the Baker, Conklin, and Barnes families, descendants of English settlers, and the Dutch brothers Abraham and Jacob Schellinger, the sons of a New Amsterdam merchant who moved to East Hampton between 1680 and 1690 after the English took over New Amsterdam.

During Operation Pastorius, a failed Nazi attack on the United States in June 1942, during World War II, a submarine dropped off four German spies on Atlantic Avenue beach in Amagansett, where they made their way to the village&#x27;s Long Island Rail Road station and boarded a train for New York. A Coast Guardsman assigned to watch the beach noticed the suspicious strangers on the beach and notified the police and the FBI.

In 2007, the original Coast Guard station, which had been moved to a private residence in 1966 to protect it from demolition, was moved back near its original location at Atlantic Avenue beach. The Coast Guard barracks are now part of the East Hampton Town Marine Museum, which includes exhibits from the town&#x27;s maritime history, including whaling relics and a cannon from the American Revolution ship HMS &quot;Culloden&quot;, which ran aground at Montauk.

In 1998 President Bill Clinton, who was vacationing in East Hampton, gave a Saturday radio address from the Amagansett Fire House.

Amagansett includes a section of Further Lane, which is a block from the ocean, and has one of East Hampton&#x27;s biggest collections of mansions. In 2007, one of the estates sold for $107 million, the highest price for a private residential property.

As part of the settlement, several 18th- and 19th-century buildings that had been moved to the estate to prevent demolition were moved elsewhere in town—including five that were moved to form a campus for the East Hampton town government.

&quot;Amagansett&quot;, a pictorial history of the hamlet, was published in 1997 by Carleton Kelsey, longtime director of the Amagansett Free Library and former town clerk, and Lucinda Mayo, descendant of one of Amagansett&#x27;s 17th-century founders.

Many houses and other buildings from the 19th and even 18th century still stand in Amagansett, Montauk, the Hamptons, and other Long Island communities.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has an area of , of which is land and , or 0.37%, is water.

At the end of the last Ice Age, Amagansett stood at Long Island&#x27;s eastern tip. At that time, Montauk was an island in the Atlantic. In the intervening several thousand years, ocean currents, or littoral drift, filled in space with sand. This area is now known as Napeague.

Distinct places within Amagansett include Amagansett village, Beach Hampton, and the Devon Colony on Gardiner&#x27;s Bay. Other places of geographic significance include the &quot;Walking Dunes&quot; in Napeague and the Atlantic Double Dunes, which are protected by The Nature Conservancy and local and federal governments.
