<text>Conshohocken ( ; ) is a borough on the Schuylkill River in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania in suburban Philadelphia. Historically a large mill town and industrial and manufacturing center, after the decline of industry in recent years Conshohocken has developed into a center of riverfront commercial and residential development. In the regional slang, it is sometimes referred to by the colloquial nickname Conshy ( ).

The sister community of West Conshohocken is located on the opposite side of the Schuylkill River.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Conshohocken&quot; comes from the Unami language and may be translated as &quot;pleasant valley&quot;. The name derives from either , meaning &quot;Elegant-ground-place&quot;, or, more likely, , which means &quot;Big-trough-ground-place&quot; or &quot;Large-bowl-ground-place&quot;, referring to the big bend in the (Turtle River, or modern Schuylkill River).

Conshohocken fronts the Schuylkill River. A rather sharp bend in the river at Conshohocken gives the Schuylkill Expressway (I-76), which hugs the far bank, a curve that is well known to regional radio listeners as the Conshohocken curve. Railroad tracks line both river banks, reflecting the valley&#x27;s heavy industrial past as well as its continuing rail activity including Norfolk Southern and SEPTA.

<text>Fort Washington is a census-designated place and suburb of Philadelphia in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. The CDP, as of 2020, is entirely in Upper Dublin Township. The population was 5,446 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
Prior to the American Revolutionary War, present-day Fort Washington was settled by German immigrants, including Philip Engard who immigrated in 1728. Engard purchased a lot of land on what was to be named Susquehanna Road and Fort Washington Avenue. By the mid-18th century, the area came to be known as Engardtown, and Fort Washington Avenue was originally called Engardtown Road. The house built by Philip Engard is listed as the &quot;Engard Family Home - 1765&quot; in the Upper Dublin Township Open Space &amp; Environmental Resource Protection Plan - 2005, as part of the Upper Dublin Historical Properties #25.

===American Revolutionary War===
During the Philadelphia campaign of the American Revolutionary War, George Washington and the Continental Army encamped in present-day Fort Washington following their October 4, 1777, defeat at the Battle of Germantown, and immediately prior to their march to Valley Forge. During the encampment, Washington was headquartered at the Emlen House, built by George Emlen, a Quaker, in 1745.

Later that year, between December 5 and December 8, 1777, the Battle of White Marsh was fought in present-day Fort Washington between the British and Continental Army. British commander General William Howe observed the American lines from the bell tower of St. Thomas&#x27; Episcopal Church at Bethlehem Pike and Camp Hill Road, where the British Army was encamped on December 5. 

A current Pennsylvania park, Fort Washington State Park in Fort Washington, includes the area where Washington and the Continental Army were located during the Battle of White Marsh.

===Great Train Wreck of 1856===

On July 17, 1856, Fort Washington was the site of one of the worst train accidents in the United States when two North Pennsylvania Railroad trains collided with one another near the Sandy Run station, later renamed Camp Hill, now the defunct Fellwick Station). The exact number of deaths is uncertain, but 59 were killed instantly and dozens more perished from their injuries. Many of the dead were children from St. Michael&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church from the Kensington section of Philadelphia, who were traveling to Sheaff&#x27;s Woods, a park in the Fort Washington area for a Sunday school picnic.

===Incorporation into Upper Dublin Township===

On January 1, 1946, the Township of Upper Dublin was created, and in doing so, encompassed Fort Washington along with nine other communities. Parts of Fort Washington were also incorporated into Whitemarsh Township.

In recent years, the Fort Washington Office Park has experienced a vacancy rate higher than that of other commercial/industrial parks in the region, due in some part to problems with flooding.

The Fort Washington Office Park was also home to the Fort Washington Expo Center. Opened in 1993 in the former Honeywell factory, the Expo Center hosted some of the region&#x27;s biggest consumer and trade shows, and at , was the largest such suburban venue in the northeastern United States. The Expo Center closed in 2006 after the building was sold to Liberty Property Trust who renovated the center into Class A office space.

<text>Horsham Township is a home rule municipality in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. It is located ten miles north of Center City Philadelphia. The township, incorporated in 1717, is one of the oldest original municipalities in Montgomery County. Although it retains the word &quot;Township&quot; in its official name, it has been governed by a Home Rule Charter since 1975 and is therefore not subject to the Pennsylvania Township Code. The population was 26,564 at the time of the 2020 census.

Horsham Township is made up of several community areas including Horsham (19044) and portions of the Hatboro (19040), Ambler (19002), Chalfont (18914) and North Wales (19454) ZIP codes.

==History==

Horsham Township is named after the market town of Horsham in West Sussex, England. Horsham is one of several townships in Montgomery County whose name and size were determined by master survey lines drawn by William Penn&#x27;s engineers as they first plotted this part of the colony for sale and settlement. Parallel lines, projected at intervals of a mile and a half and extending in a northwesterly direction from settlements along the Delaware, served not only as base lines for measurement of individual land grants but also as courses for future highways. County Line Road, Horsham Road, and Welsh Road are examples of highways so laid out. The effect of these survey lines upon the development pattern of Eastern Montgomery County is very much in evidence today.

In 1684, the entire township of was made available to individual purchasers. Samuel Carpenter, from the town of Horsham in Sussex, England, after which the township is named, purchased , within the present boundaries of the township. In 1709, Carpenter, then Treasurer of Pennsylvania, began to sell tracts of land to migrating Quakers. In 1717, Horsham Township was established as a municipal entity by a vote of the people.

In 1718, Sir William Keith, then provincial governor of Pennsylvania, acquired of Carpenter&#x27;s land on which he erected a house in keeping with the dignity of his office. The development of Keith&#x27;s &quot;plantation&quot; proved to be a step in establishing closer ties between Horsham and neighboring communities, particularly those of Hatboro and Willow Grove. He was responsible for the construction of the present Easton Road (PA Highway 611) from the old York Road junction at Willow Grove to his mansion on County Line Road in 1722.

The first significant settlement in the Township centered around the junction of Horsham and Easton Roads and was known as Horshamington. Keith&#x27;s extension of Easton Road prompted the establishment of the Horsham Friends Meeting House.

The township&#x27;s early social and economic life revolved around this Meeting House. In a similar way, Prospectville, originally known as Cashtown, was established at the junction of two roads, Limekiln Pike and Horsham Road. This portion of Limekiln Pike was an extension of the original segment established in 1693 to provide a thoroughfare between Old York Road and the limekilns of Thomas Fitzwater in Upper Dublin Township. Prospectville, on a high elevation point within the township, offering a resting spot with a tavern for those traveling along either Limekiln Pike or Horsham Road. Here lived several generations of the Simpson family, one of whom was the mother of Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th president of the United States.

The hamlet of Davis Grove grew at the intersection of Keith&#x27;s Road (now called Governors Road) and Privet Road and was once a focal point of community life. It was here the residents of the township came to vote, discuss politics, and attend community meetings. The &quot;Golden Ball Inn&quot;, which at one time was used to house guests of Governor Keith, enjoyed much Revolutionary splendor. The two roads were formerly through links. Keith&#x27;s Road extended from Easton Road to Keith Valley Road and Privet Road, from Horsham Road to Easton Road. Expansion of the Willow Grove Naval Air Station caused the closing of these roads and the absorption of the hamlet. Today, there are virtually no remaining signs of the original settlement.

Through most of the early and the middle 19th century, Horsham&#x27;s population grew slowly. Its character was not altered in any significant way until about 1872, when the North Pennsylvania Railroad extended a rail line from Glenside to New Hope and established a station in the nearby community of Hatboro, 2.75 miles (4.4 km) east of the nucleus of Horshamville. Horsham-Hatboro-Byberry Road provided easy access to Hatboro&#x27;s station and, as a result, residential development began along the road, virtually linking the two communities together. By 1890, the township&#x27;s population had reached 1,300.

In 1896, the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company&#x27;s northern extension of the Philadelphia-Willow Grove trolley service was extended to along Easton Road from the Willow Grove Amusement Park at Easton and Welsh Roads. This provided various connections to other trolley lines.

In 1926, aviation pioneer Harold F. Pitcairn, purchased a large section of farmland on the west side of Doylestown Pike (now Route 611) and constructed a hangar and a grass airstrip. From 1926 to 1942 Pitcairn used the airfield for numerous air shows and to design, construct and test a number of aircraft, including the Mailwing which was used by the United States Postal Service to carry the overnight mail between New York and Atlanta.

In 1942, the United States Navy purchased what eventually became the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base (NAS-JRB) Willow Grove which contributed to national defense for over six decades, beginning with a small group of Naval Aviators, maintenance personnel, and biplanes and evolving into a home for aircraft and personnel from every branch of the United States Armed Forces.

The Township saw significant development post WWII, beginning along Easton Road and County Line Road. This trend continued into surrounding communities. Until the late 20th century, the northwestern end of the township was still mostly rural.

In 2005, NAS-JRB Willow Grove was selected for closure by BRAC 2005 law. In late 2006, the Horsham Township Authority for NAS-JRB Willow Grove (HLRA) was selected as the Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA), and was charged with preparing the required reuse planning documents. In 2011, NAS-JRB Willow Grove was officially closed, 68 years after the base and its hangars were built.

The Navy and Marine Corps squadrons/units moved to McGuire Air Force Base in 2011. The 111th Attack Wing of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard remains at their present site along with Army Reserve and Army National Guard units on the former U.S. Air Force Reserve Center facility. The United States Army Reserve, Pennsylvania Air National Guard, and Pennsylvania Army National Guard units are located on the approximately 200-acre base that is located near the intersection of County Line and Easton Roads. The name of the installation is Biddle Air National Guard Base.

On April 27, 2012, the Horsham Township Authority for NAS-JRB (HLRA) submitted the NAS-JRB Willow Grove Redevelopment Plan and Homeless Assistance Submission to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and United States Navy. The plan includes many developments popular with area residents including small nature and conservation parks, an aviation museum, and town center; but also includes some highly unpopular developments such as a conference center and hotel on the site. Once the land is transferred, the surplus property will comprise about 8% of the Township&#x27;s total land area. The NAS-JRB Willow Grove Redevelopment Plan details the existing conditions, issues and opportunities, and recommendations that will guide the Horsham Township Authority for NAS-JRB Willow Grove in the redevelopment process.

<text>King of Prussia (nicknamed K.O.P.) is a census-designated place in Upper Merion Township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. The community took its unusual name in the 18th century from a local tavern named the King of Prussia Inn, which was named after King Frederick the Great of Prussia. King of Prussia is considered to be an edge city of Philadelphia, consisting of large amounts of retail and office space situated at the convergence of four highways.

King of Prussia is located south of Allentown and northwest of Philadelphia. It is considered part of the larger Philadelphia metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, its population was 22,028. 

King of Prussia mall is the fourth-largest shopping mall in the US. The headquarters of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Region I and American Baptist Churches USA are located in King of Prussia.

==History==
The eponymous King of Prussia Inn was originally constructed as a cottage in 1719 by the Welsh Quakers William and Janet Rees, founders of Reesville. The cottage was converted to an inn in 1769 and did a steady business in colonial times as it was approximately a day&#x27;s travel by horse from Philadelphia. Settlers headed west to Ohio would sleep at the inn on their first night on the road. In 1774 the Rees family hired James Berry to manage the inn, which henceforth became known as &quot;Berry&#x27;s Tavern&quot;. General George Washington first visited the tavern on Thanksgiving Day in 1777 while the Continental Army was encamped at Whitemarsh; a few weeks later Washington and the army bivouacked at nearby Valley Forge.

Parker&#x27;s spy map, created by William Parker, an American Loyalist, listed the inn as &quot;Berry&#x27;s&quot; in 1777, but a local petition in 1786 identified it as the &quot;King of Prussia&quot;. It was possibly renamed in honor of Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s pro-American satirical essay &quot;An Edict by the King of Prussia&quot;. At some point a wooden signboard of the inn depicted King Frederick II (Frederick the Great) of Prussia. The inn is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===20th century===
The inn was forced to move with the expansion of U.S. Route 202. U.S. 202 is a major north–south highway that passes through the town from southwest to northeast. Its construction as an expressway would have caused the destruction of the King of Prussia Inn; however, historic preservationists managed to prevail upon the state of Pennsylvania to avoid this important structure by building north and southbound lanes on either side of it. For more than a quarter century, the inn was marooned on a median island, with motor traffic whizzing past on both sides. It was sealed up for years, surrounded by a high fence. The inn was successfully relocated in 2000 and re-opened to the public in October 2002.

The extensive suburban development that has taken place since the 1960s in King of Prussia has led urban planning scholars like Joel Garreau to label the area as an epitome of the edge city phenomenon, a situation where the most vibrant economic growth and prosperity in a metropolitan area (in this case, Philadelphia) no longer occurs in the urban center, but rather at its periphery. Before 1960, the Greater King of Prussia area was known for little more than being the place of Washington&#x27;s winter respite in 1777-8 (see Valley Forge National Historical Park). The growth in King of Prussia developed around the convergence of four highways with the construction of the King of Prussia mall, a large business park, and housing developments.

Daniel Berrigan and his brother Philip Berrigan began their Plowshares Movement at the General Electric Weapons Plant in King of Prussia in 1980. That event and the subsequent court proceedings surrounding the &#x27;Plowshares Eight&#x27; were dramatically depicted by Emile de Antonio in the 1983 motion picture &quot;In the King of Prussia&quot;.

In the late 1980s, developer Dennis Maloomian acquired a golf course near the King of Prussia mall and planned a mixed-use residential and retail development that would include a town center for King of Prussia. The proposed development needed to be rezoned but Upper Merion Township officials and local residents were opposed to the plans. After several court battles, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in Maloomian&#x27;s favor in 2003. The planned development became known as the Village at Valley Forge and would include a suburban downtown, apartments, townhouses, and offices. The retail area would be known as the King of Prussia Town Center. The first part of the town center was completed in 2014 with the opening of a Wegmans grocery store. This was followed by the construction of the downtown area with several stores and restaurants. Offices are being constructed and residential areas are in development.

===21st century===
By the 2000s, the business park in King of Prussia was outdated and was losing tenants. By 2009, several office building owners pushed for Upper Merion Township to improve the business park. Improvements were made to King of Prussia including landscaping the median of US 202, installing King of Prussia signs at the borders to the community, creating a shuttle service connecting the business park to nearby train stations, and changing the zoning laws to allow for apartments and townhouses to be constructed in the business park. The vacancy rates at the business park have since dropped.

In 2016, the two sections of the King of Prussia mall, The Plaza, and The Court, were joined to create one large shopping mall after an expansion corridor was built.

The earliest known settlers in Lansdale were members of the Jenkins family. At the peak of its growth, the Jenkins homestead occupied approximately 120 acres of land. The construction of the North Pennsylvania Railroad (later absorbed into the Reading Railroad) during the 1850s contributed to rapid growth and expansion in Lansdale. Employment opportunities generated by the railroad brought settlers, housing, and local businesses to the area.

===Borough incorporation===
By 1872, Lansdale Borough was officially incorporated and named after Phillip Lansdale Fox, chief surveyor of the North Penn Railroad. By the naming conventions of the time, it should have been called Jenkintown, since the land immediately surrounding the train station was owned by the Jenkins family, but there was already a town by that name along the rail line.

<doc id="133378" wikidata="Q2879328" url="?curid=133378" title="Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania">
<text>Lower Merion Township is a township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the Philadelphia Main Line. The township&#x27;s name originates with the county of Merioneth in north Wales. Merioneth is an English-language transcription of the Welsh &quot;Meirionnydd&quot;.

A number of Main Line suburbs are located in Lower Merion, west of Philadelphia, the sixth largest city in the United States as of 2020. With a population of 63,633, Lower Merion Township is the ninth-most populous municipality in Pennsylvania as of the 2020 U.S. census.

The center of Lower Merion Township is located northwest of central Philadelphia, Pennsylvania&#x27;s largest city-county, and parts of Lower Merion border this section of the city.

==History==


Lower Merion Township was first settled in 1682 by Welsh Quakers, who were granted a tract of land, the Welsh Tract, by William Penn. In 1713, Lower Merion was established as an independent Township with about 52 landholders and tenants. In 1900, the Township was incorporated as a Township of the First Class. Lower Merion is home to the oldest continuously used place of worship in the United States, the Merion Friends Meeting House, used continuously since 1695.

On April 4, 1991, U.S. Senator John Heinz died while as a passenger in a Piper Aerostar propeller aircraft when it collided with a Bell 412 helicopter over the Merion Elementary School in the Merion air disaster. The other four people in both aircraft also died, and the falling debris from the aircraft also caused the death of two elementary students and injured five others.

The Mill Creek Historic District, and Seville Theatre are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Green Hill Farms was added in 2011.

In 2010, the township received national media attention when a student filed a lawsuit, &quot;Robbins v. Lower Merion School District&quot;, after a school administrator used the webcam of a school-issued laptop to spy on the student while the student was in his home. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed an amicus brief in support of the student.

In 2012, the Federal Highway Administration modified the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices in a way that would have required the replacement of Lower Merion Township&#x27;s historic street signs, some of which date back to the early 1910s. After some campaigning by local residents and by Senator Pat Toomey, the Lower Merion Board of Commissioners declared, via an ordinance, the entire Lower Merion as a historic district and received a waiver from Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 23.9 square miles (61.8 km2), of which 23.7 square miles (61.4 km2) is land and 0.2 square mile (0.4 km2) (0.67%) is water.

The township is bounded by Wynnefield Heights, Belmont Village, Wynnefield, and Overbrook in the city/county of Philadelphia; the boroughs of Conshohocken and West Conshohocken; the townships of Upper Merion; Whitemarsh; Haverford; and Radnor. The borough of Narberth, a separate political entity of one-half square mile, is completely surrounded by the township.

Forming the township&#x27;s southern border is City Avenue, known to many locals as &quot;City Line&quot;, a very busy major artery in this part of the metro area that also separates Montgomery and Philadelphia counties. City Avenue begins at the Schuylkill Expressway (I-76), where it also becomes U.S. Route 1, and between this area south to Bala Cynwyd is sometimes referred to as the Golden Mile. Many buildings, including the radio and television studios of Philadelphia&#x27;s NBC and ABC affiliates, PCOM, and the Fox and Germantown Savings Bank towers, line the avenue beside newer office complexes, shopping centers, and restaurants. Situated behind a lot of these spaces are condos and townhomes; several well-known residences are 191 Presidential, Corinthian Condominium and Sutton Terrace. The township&#x27;s eastern border is along the Schuylkill River.

Before European settlement, Lower Merion&#x27;s dense forest was home to bears, cougars, wolves, rattlesnakes, otters, beavers, weasels, turkeys, grouses, woodland bison, trout, and bald eagles. When Europeans arrived, they began cutting down the forests, chasing away much of the wildlife. After World War II, Lower Merion transformed from a farming township to a suburban area, and wildlife changed accordingly. Today, red foxes, white-footed mice, horned owls, skunks, raccoons, crayfish, songbirds, butterflies, and white-tailed deer populate the township.

<text>Lower Pottsgrove Township is a township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States, approximately 30 miles (51 kilometers) northwest of Philadelphia and 18 miles (30 kilometers) southeast of Reading, along the Schuylkill River. The population was 12,059 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The name &quot;Pottsgrove&quot; originated from the 18th century estate of John Potts, who built a stone mansion in Stowe (now in West Pottsgrove Township). After the American Revolution&#x27;s Battle of Brandywine in 1777, part of the Potts Estate became an encampment for George Washington&#x27;s troops. The encampment, known as Camp Pottsgrove, lasted about two weeks until Washington&#x27;s troops moved on to the battle of Germantown. The name Camp Pottsgrove stayed even after the troops moved out.

Pottsgrove Township was formed on August 20, 1806, from portions of Douglass and New Hanover Townships. Pottsgrove Township was divided into Lower Pottsgrove and Upper Pottsgrove Townships on December 2, 1889. In 1899, the General Assembly passed a law grouping townships into two classes. At this time, Lower Pottsgrove Township became a township of the second class. Following its split from Upper Pottsgrove, Lower Pottsgrove Township experienced several annexations of territory from the neighboring Pottstown Borough. On January 16, 1931, the Borough of Pottstown annexed two portions of Lower Pottsgrove Township: from Moser to Porter Road and an area bounded by Prospect to Mervine and Adams to Charlotte Streets because Pottstown believed &quot;the township had been taking tax money for years and giving nothing in return.&quot; In 1942, Pottstown annexed a little more than five acres bounded by North Hills Boulevard, Mulberry Street and Keim Street.

In November 1953, the voters of Lower Pottsgrove Township supported the Township becoming a first-class Township for the primary purpose of preventing further annexation by the Borough of Pottstown. Lower Pottsgrove Township became a first-class township on January 7, 1954.

The Sanatoga Union Sunday School and Sunnybrook are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 8.0 square miles (20.8 km2), of which 7.9 square miles (20.5 km2) is land and 0.1 square mile (0.3 km2) (1.50%) is water. It is drained by the Schuylkill River, which separates it from Chester County. The township includes the Sanatoga CDP.

The Township also offers trails, baseball fields, soccer fields, basketball courts, playground areas, and a band shell for active recreational uses.

===Ringing Rocks Park===
The area considered Ringing Rocks is owned by both the Ringing Hill Fire Company and Lower Pottsgrove Township and is renowned for its fields of ringing rocks. The boulders range in size from three pounds to an estimated 25 tons and are igneous plutonic or intrusion rocks, which are formed by molten magma that solidifies underground before it reaches the surface of the earth. These granite rocks, like many other boulder fields in the area, have been exposed by erosion.

In the late 19th, early 20th Century, Ringing Rocks Park was an amusement park owned by the Pottstown Passenger Railway Company. The park contained a carousel; a menagerie with lions, tigers, bears, alligators, and other native wildlife; an observation tower; a spring-fed swimming pond; and a 4,000 foot-long roller coaster. The Pottstown Passenger Railway Company operated a trolley between 1893 and 1937 that served area residents.

Today, the portion of the park owned by the Ringing Hill Fire Company hosts the Fire Company and recreational amenities such as a skating rink, picnic tables and a softball diamond. The portion of the park owned by Lower Pottsgrove Township (approximately 40 acres) is passive open space with a trail system.

===Sanatoga Park===
The 54-acre Sanatoga Park currently hosts the man-made Sanatoga Lake, a bandshell, pavilion, playground, soccer field and baseball field. The Pottstown Passenger Railway Company also owned and operated Sanatoga Park, a stop on its trolley line. Sanatoga Park included boat rides, picnic areas, and a natural pathway around Sanatoga Lake. Other amusements included, a swimming pool with a natural sandy bottom, a restaurant, playgrounds, a carousel, a restaurant and a pavilion that hosted concerts. The Alpine Dips roller coaster was the first ride of its kind built in an amusement park. The football/baseball field at Sanatoga Park was where the young Bobby Shantz got his start. Starting in 1939, the park hosted the Sanatoga Speedway, a one-fifth mile flat dirt track from 35 to 38 feet wide, with an area of 4,100 square yards. After the first race, the track was paved due to an enormous dust problem. The Speedway, which was promoted by George Marshman, drew large crowds for a variety of Midget and Stock car races. A 1/2 mile paved Drag Strip was near completion when the track was closed on September 12, 1958. Some of the track can still be seen today. Lower Pottsgrove Township purchased the park in 1965.

<text>Lower Salford is a township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located one mile west of the Lansdale exit of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (exit 31). It is centered on the intersection of Route 63 (Main St), and Route 113 (Harleysville Pike).

==Geography==
The township has a total area of 14.5 square miles (37.5 km2), of which 14.4 square miles (37.3 km2) is land and 0.1 square mile (0.2 km2) (0.41%) is water. The East Branch Perkiomen Creek and Skippack Creek are tributaries of the Perkiomen Creek draining the township.

==History==
===Founding===
Lower Salford was originally part of the larger Salford Township, until, in March 1741 Jacob Reiff petitioned the Court of Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia County to split the Township into what are now called Lower Salford, Upper Salford, Marlborough, and Franconia Townships. Lower Salford contains the villages of Harleysville, Lederach, Mainland, and Vernfield.

The area around Lower Salford was originally settled in the early 1700s by farmers from Germany, Switzerland, and Holland. Because of this, most people at the time spoke primarily Pennsylvania Dutch, until the mid 1900s.

===Heckler Plains===

Heckler Plains is a 36-acre farmstead, now park. It was once home to Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, a General at the Battle of Gettysburg. There still stands a barn from 1761, an 18th-century kitchen garden, and an outdoor bake oven from 1780. Hecklerfest is held annually and has soap making, butter churning, candle dipping, and other Colonial Era demonstrations.

===Klein Meetinghouse===
The Klein Meetinghouse is a historic Dunkard (Schwarzenau Brethren or Church of the Brethren) meetinghouse in Harleysville, Pennsylvania built in 1843. The second oldest congregation of the Brethren in the United States, which was founded in the area in 1720, built the meetinghouse, and the adjoining cemetery contains the remains of Peter Becker, who led the Brethren to America in 1714.

===Dielman Kolb Homestead===
The Dielman Kolb Homestead is a historic home located near Lederach. The house was built in 1717, and is a -story, gambrel-roofed dwelling with a modified Germanic floor plan. It has an attached summer kitchen. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

==Entertainment and recreation==
The Lederach Golf Club is a public, 18 hole golf course opened in 2006. It is owned by the township of Lower Salford. It has a par 71 layout with five sets of tees from 7,000 yards to 2,800 yards.

Lower Salford has 12 parks as part of the federal, state and county sponsored &quot;Open Space/Green Belt&quot; program.

==Arts==
The township flag and logo were designed by John H. Drenning, president of the Heckler Plains Folklife Society, in 1991. The center of the logo depicts a Pennsylvania Dutch couple in front of a wheat field. Above the depiction is the word “gemeinschaft,” which is German for “a sense of community.&quot; The background of the flag has three wavy stripes; brown for the fertile soil, green for the abundant grass and other plants, and gold for the bountiful crops and warm sunshine. On the sides of the flag are two cedar trees representing the much praised wood. The top of the flag has LOWER SALFORD on a field of blue sky with four stars to represent the four villages that make up the township.

Lower Salford is home to The Mennonite Heritage Center. &quot;A museum and historical library dedicated to preserving and sharing the stories of Mennonite faith and life in eastern Pennsylvania.&quot; Which holds an annual Apple Butter Frolic, an autumn festival featuring Pennsylvania Dutch foods, crafts, and farming demonstrations.

Lower Salford is home to a large-scale exterior mural designed by Dana McMullin, residing on the side of Rann Pharmacy. McMullin executed the public work with a small team in 2006 from its concept to production, portraying a visually nostalgic history of Harleysville from settlement to modern day.

==Government==
=== Board of Supervisors ===

<text>Montgomery Township is a township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. It is the location of the Montgomery Mall, a regional shopping mall serving the Route 309 corridor of the Philadelphia suburbs. Much of Montgomery Township&#x27;s development is suburban in character, with newer tract houses and strip shopping centers. Homes in Montgomery Township have North Wales and Lansdale (although the township is distinct from those boroughs) addresses, but businesses that are located within the township boundaries are given the Montgomeryville ZIP Code. The township is in the North Penn School District and is part of the North Penn Valley region that is centered around the borough of Lansdale.

==History==
Montgomery Township was incorporated in 1714. Alexander Edwards was certainly one of the first settlers, and probably the very earliest in Montgomery. Originally from Wales, he died in 1712 and described himself in his will as &quot;of Montgomery&quot;, showing that the township had been created before that time, When old Philadelphia County was partitioned on September 10, 1784, Montgomery Township was included in Montgomery County. There were many Welsh within Montgomery and its surrounding townships, descendants of those who left Wales in the aftermath of the English Civil War. The new county was likely named for the historic county of Montgomeryshire, Wales, where many of the earliest Welsh settlers hailed from.

The Knapp Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

Narberth is an enclave surrounded by Lower Merion Township, close to the western edge of the city of Philadelphia. It is part of the Philadelphia Main Line, a string of leafy, picturesque suburbs with quaint Welsh names extending west from Philadelphia along the old Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s &quot;main line&quot; from Merion through Ardmore, Bryn Mawr, Villanova, Devon and Wayne among other towns and municipalities. Narberth is unique among those locations in that it is fairly enclosed; no major thoroughfares run through the town, but Montgomery Avenue runs northwest–southeast along the borough&#x27;s northern border.

Because of its small size, many of Narberth&#x27;s shopping and recreational facilities are within walking distance of residents&#x27; houses. SEPTA&#x27;s &quot;Main Line&quot; railroad tracks separate North Side from South Side. Narberth is mostly a residential community, with a central business district along Haverford, Narberth, Forrest, and Essex Avenues. The borough is bordered by the communities of Wynnewood, Merion, and Penn Valley.

==Climate==
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Narberth has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

Average monthly temperatures range from 32.2 °F in January to 77.2 °F in July. 

==Shopping and entertainment==
Narberth&#x27;s business district has a variety of small, generally independent businesses. Some have been there for decades, including The Cheese Company and Real Pizza. Narberth also has an independent movie theater located in its downtown. Many borough businesses belong to the Narberth Business Association, which promotes the town as a shopping destination and also puts on occasional events, including the Spring Sidewalk Sale and the Narberth Dickens Festival.

==Recreation==
The Borough of Narberth maintains two recreational facilities: The Narberth Playground and the Sabine Avenue Playground. The Narberth Playground has two basketball courts, three tennis courts, a field area, a junior basketball court (once volleyball), and a playground for younger children. The Sabine Avenue Tot Lot, on the grounds of the former Narberth Elementary School, is the smaller of the two and was recently renovated with new playground equipment. In addition, the borough sponsors a Fall soccer program, a Spring baseball program, a Summer basketball program, and many other sports and recreation activities.

Amanda Cappelletti).

==Education==
===Public K-12 education===
Residents of Narberth are served by the Lower Merion School District (LMSD). the school zoning for the borough is as follows: most of the borough (portions north of Haverford Avenue) is zoned to Belmont Hills Elementary School and Welsh Valley Middle School, while portions south of Haverford Avenue are zoned to Merion Elementary School and Bala Cynwyd Middle School. For high school, a portion is in the walking zone for Lower Merion High School. The rest of the borough is in a choice zone where students may attend either Lower Merion HS or Harriton High School. All of the mentioned schools are in Lower Merion Township. Penn Valley Elementary School, also located in the township, has a Narberth post office address, though as of 2024 its attendance boundary does not include any part of Narberth borough.

Narberth, then in Lower Merion Township, was in LMSD when, circa 1892, the first Narberth School was established. Narberth separated from the township, and in 1895, LMSD sold the building to the township school district. The last building for Narberth Elementary School opened in 1963. LMSD began operating the school again in 1966, and at that time, Narberth Elementary was the sole public school in the borough limits. That year, students in South Narberth were reassigned to Merion Elementary School, while the Merion Park community was rezoned to Narberth Elementary. In 1966, Narberth residents were zoned to Ardmore Junior High School.

Narberth Elementary School closed in 1978. The school closed due to a vote by the LMSD board of trustees, seven in favor and two against. Residents were rezoned to Cynwyd Elementary School. There was a lawsuit to try to prevent the closure of Narberth Elementary, but the lawsuit was later canceled. The school district gave the former Narberth school to the borough government, and an engineering company rented the building. The lease agreement had a stipulation in the event that LMSD needed additional school space. In 1996 the former school was still being used as an office facility.

Belmont Hills Elementary closed in 1981, but by 1996 the district considered reopening it or Narberth Elementary, though the district leadership was closer to supporting the reopening of Belmont Hills elementary. This was because reopening Narberth Elementary meant that LMSD would have had to reacquire the building, which it could not do in a manner the district leadership felt was timely. The district would not have been able to take control of the building until 1999. Of the possible choices of facilities to reopen, LMSD would have had to spend $11,100,000 on a reopened Narberth Elementary, making it the option where the district had to spend the most money. People living in Narberth did not significantly advocate for the reopening of Narberth Elementary. In 1997, students in the South Narberth area were zoned to Merion Elementary, which was and is within walking distance.

By 1998 the school district established a new attendance boundary for Belmont Hills Elementary, which included the northern part of Narberth, with that section taken from Cynwyd Elementary. This meant that students began to have longer times to travel to school. The organization &quot;Parents Against Gerrymandering,&quot; made up of parents from the borough, sued the school district to try to stop the rezoning. Several parents preferred rezoning to Merion Elementary instead.

<text>Norristown is a municipality with home rule status and the county seat of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States, in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Located along the Schuylkill River, approximately from Philadelphia, Norristown had a population of 35,748 as of the 2020 census. It is the fourth-most populous municipality in the county and second-most populous borough in Pennsylvania.

It is the largest non-township municipality in Montgomery County and is located southeast of Allentown and northwest of Philadelphia.

==History==

Present-day Norristown was originally owned by the family of Isaac Norris. Along with William Trent, Norris purchased the land on October 7, 1704, for 50¢ per acre. In 1712, Norris acquired Trent&#x27;s share and established a gristmill at the foot of present-day Water Street.

Named the county seat in 1784 when Montgomery County was formed, Norristown was incorporated as a borough in 1812 and subsequently enlarged in 1853. About 500 people lived there at the time of its incorporation. Growing rapidly after the Civil War, it swelled to 22,265 people by 1900. By 1940 it was home to 38,181 Norristonians, making it the most populous borough in Pennsylvania before declining in the decades after World War II, and in fact it was described in that year as &quot;the most populous independent borough in the United States.&quot;

At its height, Norristown was an industrial, retail, banking, and government center. Breweries, cigar factories, textile mills, icehouses, foundries, rolling mills, and lumber yards provided ample employment for skilled laborers and artisans. The downtown featured two department stores, several theaters, and enough goods and services that residents never had to leave town to find anything they needed. Although primarily settled by the English and a handful of Germans, Scots, Dutch, and Swedes, in the mid-1800s the Irish began arriving in large numbers, followed by waves of Italians at the turn of the 20th century.

With the opening of new malls in nearby King of Prussia and Plymouth Meeting, the downtown declined in the decades after World War II. Industry soon followed, as many companies closed or relocated into new industrial parks throughout Montgomery County.

==Geography==
Norristown is located in southeastern Pennsylvania, approximately northwest of Philadelphia, although direct driving distance from downtown Norristown to Center City Philadelphia is about . Totaling 3.519 square miles in land area, the municipality sits along the Schuylkill River. Two major tributaries, the Stony Creek and the Saw Mill Run, bisect the town into thirds and empty directly into the Schuylkill. The town&#x27;s terrain is generally hilly, especially in the areas closest to downtown, which itself sits on a plateau surrounded by all three major waterways.

Norristown has four distinct neighborhoods: the West End, the East End, the North End, and the downtown.

It is bounded by West Norriton, East Norriton, and Plymouth townships, as well as the borough of Bridgeport.

===Climate===
In the Köppen climate classification, the borough has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) according to recent temperature numbers. The Trewartha climate classification now has the climate as &quot;Do&quot; (oceanic because only seven months are above 50 °F.) The hardiness zone is 7a or 7b depending upon elevation.

==Demographics==
As of 2019, Norristown&#x27;s population is 34,341, which represents a 0% increase since 2010. The municipality&#x27;s population is 37.2% black or African American, 27.9% white (non-Hispanic), 27.1% Hispanic and two or more races 6.4%.

There were 11,963 households and 7,498 families residing in the municipality. The population density was 9,753.9 people per square mile. There were 13,420 housing units at an average density of 3,813.5 per square mile.

Of the 11,963 households, 62.7% (7,498) were family households and 37.3% were non-family households. Of the 7,498 families, 58.2% had their own and related children under the age of 18 living with them; 51.0% were married couples living together, and 36.6% had a female householder with no husband present. The average household size was 2.79 and the average family size was 3.41.

The median age of all residents is 31.2 years, with an age distribution of 26.2% under the age of 18, 43.5% between ages 18 and 44, 21.2% between ages 45 and 64, and 9.1% ages 65 and above.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s 2012 American Community Survey, the median household income was $42,764. Males had a median income of $34,214 versus $34,086 for females. The per capita income was $21,204. About 17.3% of families and 19.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 28.3% of those under the age of 18 and 11.8% of those 65 and older.

Approximately 76.0% of all persons 25 and older have a high school diploma or higher, while 16.7% have a college degree (Bachelor&#x27;s or higher).

==Economy==

Norristown&#x27;s economy is based largely on institutions in the government, healthcare, legal, and social services sectors. The Montgomery County government is the municipality&#x27;s largest employer. Major Norristown employers include the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the Montgomery County Intermediate Unit, the Norristown Area School District, and others.

==Politics and government==

Norristown has been a home rule municipality since 1986 when voters adopted a charter with a manager/council form of government and a seven-member municipal council. The office of mayor was abolished in July 2004 after a public referendum amended the municipal charter. Executive and administrative authority is now delegated to a council appointed Municipal Manager.

The municipality is part of the Fifth Congressional District (represented by Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon), the 70th State House Districts (represented by Rep. Matt Bradford) and the 17th State Senate District (represented by Sen. Amanda Cappelletti).

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
As of 2015 there were of public roads in Norristown, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the borough.

Norristown sits near the junction of several major roads in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Main Street, also known as Ridge Pike, outside of the municipality, and Airy Street run east–west through the downtown, eventually leading to interchanges for I-476 (the Blue Route) and the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276), respectively, in Plymouth Meeting. US 202 is the major north–south route through the town, connecting it with other nearby county seats such as Doylestown and West Chester. US 202 is split into a one-way pair through the municipality, as DeKalb Street is designated “US 202 North” while Markley Street is signed “US 202 South.”

Norristown is the largest multi-modal transportation hub in Montgomery County. Numerous rail lines, bus routes, multi-use trails, and parking areas converge at the Norristown Transportation Center (NTC). SEPTA operates eight Suburban Division bus routes (, and ), one interurban rapid transit route, the Norristown High Speed Line to 69th Street Transportation Center, and a Regional Rail line (the Manayunk/Norristown Line to Center City Philadelphia) out of the NTC complex.

The Regional Rail station at the Norristown Transportation Center is one of three on the Manayunk/Norristown Line in Norristown. The other two are Main Street and Elm Street, the latter of which serves as the terminus of the line.

The NTC contains a 522-space SEPTA commuter parking garage that also contains an intercity bus terminal that was formerly used by Bieber Transportation Group, Greyhound Lines, and Martz Trailways. Several taxi companies and private bus shuttles have a presence at the Transportation Center. The Schuylkill River Trail, which connects Philadelphia to Pottstown and runs through downtown Norristown, also passes through the NTC complex. The Chester Valley Trail will also connect to the Transportation Center in the future.

===Utilities===
Electricity and natural gas in Norristown is provided by PECO Energy Company, a subsidiary of Exelon. Water is provided by Pennsylvania American Water, a subsidiary of American Water. The Norristown Municipal Waste Authority provides sewer service, operating collection sewers and a wastewater treatment plant. Trash and recycling collection is provided under contract by J.P. Mascaro.

==Media==
&quot;The Times Herald&quot; is the borough&#x27;s daily newspaper, printing seven days a week and serving most of Montgomery County. Founded on June 15, 1799, it is currently owned by 21st Century Media. The paper&#x27;s staff offices are located within the municipality.

==Culture==

Despite the loss of its historic movie and vaudeville theaters, Norristown is home to two performing arts centers, the Montgomery County Cultural Center and Centre Theatre, and one professional theater company, Theatre Horizon. All are part of The Theatre Alliance of Greater Philadelphia and the Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance.

These theaters form the nucleus for Norristown Arts Hill, a collection of theaters, art galleries, and professional firms on the 300-500 blocks of DeKalb Street in downtown.

==Revitalization==
Norristown has seen several new office buildings constructed or rehabbed over the last several decades. One Montgomery Plaza, the municipality&#x27;s iconic downtown 10-story office building, was built in the early 1970s, and is now owned by Montgomery County. Two newer mid-rise downtown office buildings, the Montgomery County Intermediate Unit Building and the Department of Environmental Protection Building, were built in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2009, the historic former Bell Telephone building was completely renovated for offices, and that same year the U.S. Roofing Corporation rehabbed the former Conte Luna pasta factory on East Main Street to house their operations. The former Sears building at the Studio Centre shopping center in the North End was renovated as a modern office center.

Since the early 2000s, Regatta Apartments, the Rittenhouse condominium building, the Luxor, and dozens of new townhouses have contributed to a residential boom in the East End.

Two new downtown parking garages were built in the late 2000s, one at Main and Cherry Streets for visitors and another at SEPTA’s Norristown Transportation Center on Lafayette Street. Several large downtown and neighborhood streetscape projects were completed by the municipal government to install new street lighting, trees, curbing, and sidewalks along Main Street, DeKalb Street, and Powell Street.

The Lafayette Street Extension Project, a $60 million effort by Montgomery County, PennDOT, and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), is now open to traffic. It has improved highway access and mobility into downtown Norristown by widening Lafayette Street and extending it eastward toward Ridge Pike and Conshohocken, with eventual connections to the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276) and the US 202 Dannehower Bridge.

==Education==

Norristown Area School District is the local school district.

St. Francis of Assisi School is located in Norristown.

Other area Catholic schools include Visitation B.V.M. School in West Norriton Township, near the Trooper census-designated place and near Norristown; Holy Rosary Regional Catholic School in Plymouth Meeting and Plymouth Township; and Mother Teresa Regional Catholic School in King of Prussia. 

Holy Rosary was formed in 2012 by the merger of St. Titus School in East Norriton Township, Epiphany of Our Lord School in Plymouth Meeting, and Our Lady of Victory in East Norriton. Mother Teresa formed in 2012 by the merger of St. Teresa of Avila in West Norriton Township and Mother of Divine Providence in King of Prussia. Both St. Titus and St. Teresa had Norristown, Pennsylvania postal addresses but were not in the city proper.

<text>North Wales is a borough in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. It is a suburb of Philadelphia and is one of the three historic population centers that make up the North Penn Valley, which is centered on the borough of Lansdale. It is approximately north of Center City Philadelphia. The population was 3,426 as of the 2020 census.

Like many small boroughs in Pennsylvania, North Wales&#x27; boundaries have not kept pace with population growth. In similar fashion, many businesses and residences with North Wales addresses are located in outlying townships that were never annexed by the borough, such as the Montgomery Mall in Montgomery Township. North Wales is in the North Penn School District.

==History==
===18th century===
As its name suggests, North Wales was settled by Welsh immigrants who named it after North Wales in Wales. Part of a 1702 land grant by William Penn, the area was then a rich farming country named &quot;&#x27;Gwynedd&quot; for the homeland of the earliest settlers. It began as a pastoral village in agricultural Gwynedd Township.

===19th century===
Before 1850, a number of farms, and a 1776 church, shared by the Lutheran and Episcopal congregations, dotted the present borough&#x27;s landscape. What is now Main Street was originally an old Indian trail, and was laid out as the Great Road in 1728. By 1828, it had become today&#x27;s Sumneytown Pike, and was a toll road until 1914. It had always been an important route to Philadelphia, and continues to serve as a connection to Routes 202 and 309 to the east and the Northeastern Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike to the west.

Its rural character was abruptly disrupted by the building of the North Pennsylvania Railroad starting in 1852. Service from Bethlehem to Philadelphia through North Wales began in 1857.

The town quickly grew around the railroad station, with hotels and restaurants lining Walnut Street and Main Street within walking distance. North Wales is the oldest of the North Penn boroughs, incorporated in 1869, by taking land from today&#x27;s Upper Gwynedd Township, then the northern portion of Gwynedd Township. Some of the large homes at the start of the 20th century were opened to summer guests from the city.

&quot;Idlewilde&quot;, still present on Main Street, hosted Pedro II of Brazil, the last monarch of Brazil, during his visit to Philadelphia to open the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1875 with President Ulysses S. Grant.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, much of North Wales borough&#x27;s housing was built. Most houses along South Main Street between Montgomery and Prospects Streets remain much as they were when built and are lovingly maintained. The borough also features a variety of single family homes, as well as twins, and rowhouses.

===20th century===
Between 1900 and 1926, Lehigh Valley Transit Company operated its Chestnut Hill Branch trolley line, which connected North Wales to surrounding towns through service to either Philadelphia or Allentown.

The trolley ran down Main Street through the borough, but detoured onto Pennsylvania Avenue for two blocks to enable it to cross the North Penn Railroad on a bridge.

The bridge was required because the railroad, citing safety concerns, refused to allow the trolleys to cross at the Main Street grade crossing. Lehigh Valley Transit Company&#x27;s combined passenger and freight station was located on the northeast side of Pennsylvania Avenue between Shearer Street and Montgomery Avenue. After Main Street trolley service ended in 1926, Lehigh Valley Transit high-speed trolleys continued to serve the Wales Junction station, located on Sumneytown Pike three-quarters of a mile west of town. High-speed trolley serviced ended in September 1951.

===21st century===
In 2000, the North Wales Historic Preservation District was established by Borough Council and the Pennsylvania Historic and Museum Commission to protect the architecture that is a visual reminder of the borough&#x27;s past. It is the first Historic District in the North Penn boroughs.

==Business district==
North Wales&#x27; Main and Walnut Streets have been home to many businesses over the town&#x27;s history; they still provide services such as hair salons and beauty parlors, doctors&#x27; offices, a dry cleaner, a running and walking shoe specialty store, a yoga studio, two auto repair facilities and auto body shops, two laundromats, a post office, convenience store, and a recording studio. Eateries and bars include two pizza parlors, a Tex-Mex restaurant, two cafés, a bakery, a protein-shake café and a vegan restaurant.

==Education==

North Wales Elementary School is part of the North Penn School District. The building was North Wales High School from 1927 until North Penn High School was built in the 1950s; it then became an elementary school. The original elementary school from the 1900s was located at the current site of Borough Hall.

Mater Dei Catholic School in Lansdale, of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia. In January 2012, the archdiocese announced that St. Rose of Lima would merge with St. Stanislaus Parish School in Lansdale, with students attending classes in Lansdale.

===Library===
North Wales Elementary School formerly housed the North Wales Memorial Free Library from 1927 to 2009. Due to the growing number of students at school, as well as the library&#x27;s need for more space, the library purchased and relocated to a much larger (10,000 ft2, over 900 m2) building at 233 South Swartley Street. They began operating with limited hours at the new location on January 4, 2010, and had their grand opening in April 2010 with full hours, including Saturday. The library has also changed its name to &quot;North Wales Area Library&quot; upon its move. It is part of the Montgomery County Library System.

==Parks and recreation==

Weingartner Park is located at Second and Summit Streets. It has paths, benches and shady trees. The Wee Wailers park, a children&#x27;s playground, is on Shearer St.

Second Street Park, at Second Street and Prospect Avenue, is a public tennis court area.

The Fourth Street Park is an open area, about , used for various sporting activities. The clay totem poles were made by residents.

Eighth Street Park, also known as &quot;A Child&#x27;s Garden,&quot; was developed by local children. It has a brick walking path, plantings and benches.

Ninth Street Park, at Ninth and Church Streets, is a watershed runoff area designed to attract birds. There is a trail with footbridge over the drainage area; it is a natural-feeling area.

<doc id="133391" wikidata="Q1185397" url="?curid=133391" title="Oreland, Pennsylvania">
<text>Oreland is a United States census-designated place (CDP) in Springfield and Upper Dublin townships, just outside the Chestnut Hill and Mount Airy areas of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Oreland has a ZIP code of 19075, and the population was 5,678 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Oreland is located at (40.114510, -75.179880).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

== History ==
Oreland, as part of Springfield Township, was settled as one of William Penn&#x27;s manors.

In 1686, Thomas Fitzwater discovered vast lime deposits on his land in Oreland. He erected a kiln to process it, which by 1693 had attracted the attention of William Penn. Penn ordered a highway built from the port of the Delaware River to the kiln. Named Limekiln Pike, and still in existence today, it was one of the first roads in the area. These lime deposits and the ore deposits also found in the area gave Oreland its name. Mining and farming would dominate Oreland&#x27;s economy until the 20th century, when Oreland transformed into a residential suburb of Philadelphia, as it remains today.

The village of Oreland was not laid out until 1889 near the North Penn Railroad running along the east side of town (currently SEPTA&#x27;s Lansdale/Doylestown Line). The Plymouth Railroad ran from Conshohocken to Oreland through Plymouth and Flourtown. The tracks were mostly removed in the 1980s. The path where the trains used to run begins northeast of the Oreland Station Apartments, next to Ehrenpfort Road, and runs southwest towards Flourtown. The actual tracks, which still connect to SEPTA&#x27;s Lansdale/Doylestown Line, end near the corner of Montgomery Avenue and Lyster Road. The path continues all the way to Flourtown, although in the 1990s the path was cut at Oreland Mill Road by housing built on both sides. The remainder of the path today is used primarily by children, runners and bikers.

A bronze tablet, installed in 1928, marks where Emlen House is located. Emlen House served as George Washington&#x27;s headquarters while in neighboring Whitemarsh from November 2 until December 11, 1777 during the Revolutionary War . In the early 1900s it was owned by Frances and A. J. Antello Devereux and named &quot;Mistfield Farm&quot;. In 1956, it was purchased by Edward Piszek, founder of Mrs. Paul&#x27;s Kitchens, a frozen seafood company. It was in the Piszek family until 2013 when it was sold to a developer. The location of the farm straddles Oreland and Whitemarsh.

<doc id="133392" wikidata="Q83309" url="?curid=133392" title="Johann Strauss II">
<text>Johann Baptist Strauss II (; ; 25 October 1825 – 3 June 1899), also known as Johann Strauss Jr., the Younger or the Son (), was an Austrian composer of light music, particularly dance music and operettas as well as a violinist. He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as &quot;The Waltz King&quot;, and was largely responsible for the popularity of the waltz in the 19th century. Some of Johann Strauss&#x27;s most famous works include &quot;The Blue Danube&quot;, &quot;Kaiser-Walzer&quot; (Emperor Waltz), &quot;Tales from the Vienna Woods&quot;, &quot;Frühlingsstimmen&quot;, and the &quot;Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka&quot;. Among his operettas, &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; and &quot;Der Zigeunerbaron&quot; are the best known.

Strauss was the son of Johann Strauss I and his first wife Maria Anna Streim. Two younger brothers, Josef and Eduard Strauss, also became composers of light music, although they were never as well known as their brother.

==Spelling of name==
Although the name Strauss can be found in reference books frequently with &quot;ß&quot; (Strauß), Strauss himself wrote his name with a long &quot;s&quot; and a round &quot;s&quot; (Strauſs), which was a replacement form for the Fraktur-ß used in antique manuscripts. His family called him &quot;Schani&quot; (Johnny), derived from the French &quot;Jean&quot; with addition of the endearment ending &quot;-i&quot;.

==Early life==
Strauss was born into a Catholic family in St Ulrich near Vienna (now a part of Neubau), Austria, on 25 October 1825, to the composer Johann Strauss I and his first wife, Maria Anna Streim. His paternal great-grandfather was a Hungarian Jew – a fact which the Nazis, who lionised Strauss&#x27;s music as &quot;so German&quot;, later tried to conceal. His father did not want him to become a musician but rather a banker. Nevertheless, Strauss Jr. studied the violin secretly as a child with the first violinist of his father&#x27;s orchestra, Franz Amon. When his father discovered his son secretly practising on a violin one day, he gave him a severe whipping, saying that he was going to beat the music out of the boy. It seems that rather than trying to avoid a Strauss rivalry, the elder Strauss only wanted his son to escape the rigours of a musician&#x27;s life. It was only when the father abandoned his family for a mistress, , that the son was able to concentrate fully on a career as a composer with the support of his mother.

Strauss studied counterpoint and harmony with theorist Professor Joachim Hoffmann, who owned a private music school. His talents were also recognized by composer Joseph Drechsler, who taught him exercises in harmony. It was during that time that he composed his only sacred work, the gradual &quot;&quot; (1844). His other violin teacher, Anton Kollmann, who was the ballet répétiteur of the Vienna Court Opera, also wrote excellent testimonials for him. Armed with these, he approached the Viennese authorities to apply for a license to perform. He initially formed his small orchestra where he recruited his members at the &quot;Zur Stadt Belgrad&quot; tavern, where musicians seeking work could be hired easily.

== Debut as a composer ==
Johann Strauss I&#x27;s influence over the local entertainment establishments meant that many of them were wary of offering the younger Strauss a contract for fear of angering the father. Strauss Jr. was able to persuade Dommayer&#x27;s Casino in Hietzing, a suburb of Vienna, to allow him to perform. The elder Strauss, in anger at his son&#x27;s disobedience, and at that of the proprietor, refused to ever play again at Dommayer&#x27;s Casino, which had been the site of many of his earlier triumphs.

Strauss made his debut at Dommayer&#x27;s in October 1844, where he performed some of his first works, such as the waltzes &quot;Sinngedichte&quot;, Op. 1 and &quot;Gunstwerber&quot;, Op. 4 and the polka &quot;Herzenslust&quot;, Op. 3. Critics and the press were unanimous in their praise of Strauss&#x27;s music. A critic for &quot;Der Wanderer&quot; commented that &quot;Strauss&#x27;s name will be worthily continued in his son; children and children&#x27;s children can look forward to the future, and three-quarter time will find a strong footing in him.&quot;

Despite the initial fanfare, Strauss found his early years as a composer difficult, but he soon won over audiences after accepting commissions to perform away from home. The first major appointment for the young composer was his award of the honorary position of &quot;Kapellmeister of the 2nd Vienna Citizen&#x27;s Regiment&quot;, which had been left vacant following Joseph Lanner&#x27;s death two years before.

Vienna was wracked by the revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire, and the intense rivalry between father and son became much more apparent. The son decided to side with the revolutionaries. It was a decision that was professionally disadvantageous, as the Austrian royalty twice denied him the much coveted position of &quot;KK Hofballmusikdirektor&quot;, which was first designated especially for Johann I in recognition of his musical contributions. Further, the younger Strauss was also arrested by the Viennese authorities for publicly playing &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, but was later acquitted. The elder Strauss remained loyal to the monarchy and composed his &quot;Radetzky March&quot;, Op. 228 (dedicated to the Habsburg field marshal Joseph Radetzky von Radetz), which would become one of his best-known compositions.

When the elder Strauss died from scarlet fever in Vienna in 1849, the younger Strauss merged both their orchestras and engaged in further tours. Later, he also composed a number of patriotic marches dedicated to the Habsburg Emperor Franz Josef I, such as the &quot;Kaiser Franz-Josef Marsch&quot; Op. 67 and the &quot;Kaiser Franz Josef Rettungs Jubel-Marsch&quot; Op. 126, probably to ingratiate himself in the eyes of the new monarch, who had ascended the Austrian throne after the 1848 revolution.

== Career advancements ==
Strauss Jr. eventually attained greater fame than his father and became one of the most popular waltz composers of the era, extensively touring Austria, Poland and Germany with his orchestra. He applied for the position of &quot;KK Hofballmusikdirektor&quot; (Music Director of the Royal Court Balls), which he finally attained in 1863, after being denied several times before for his frequent brushes with the local authorities.

In 1853, due to constant mental and physical demands, Strauss suffered a nervous breakdown. He took a seven-week vacation in the countryside in the summer of that year on the advice of doctors. Johann&#x27;s younger brother Josef was persuaded by his family to abandon his career as an engineer and take command of Johann&#x27;s orchestra in the interim.

In 1855, Strauss accepted commissions from the management of the Tsarskoye-Selo Railway Company of Saint Petersburg to play in Russia for the Vauxhall Pavilion at Pavlovsk in 1856. He would return to perform in Russia every year until 1865.

In 1862, the 27-year-old Eduard Strauss officially joined the Strauss orchestra as another conductor, and he and his brother Josef would lead it until 1870.

Strauss came to the United States in 1872, where he took part in the World&#x27;s Peace Jubilee and International Musical Festival in Boston at the invitation of bandmaster Patrick Gilmore and was the lead conductor in a &quot;Monster Concert&quot; of over 1000 performers performing his &quot;Blue Danube&quot; waltz. He also conducted other pieces of his at the Festival with a smaller orchestra to great acclaim.

As was customary at the time, requests for personal mementos from celebrities were often in the form of a lock of hair. In the case of Strauss during his visit to America, his valet obliged by clipping Strauss&#x27;s black Newfoundland dog and providing &quot;authentic Strauss hair&quot; to adoring female fans. However, on account of the high volume of demand, there grew a fear that the dog would be trimmed bald.

== Marriages ==
Strauss married the singer Henrietta Treffz in 1862, and they remained together until her death in 1878. Six weeks after her death, Strauss married the actress Angelika Dittrich. Dittrich was not a fervent supporter of his music, and their differences in status and opinion, and especially her indiscretion, led him to seek a divorce.

Strauss was not granted a decree of annulment by the Roman Catholic Church, and therefore changed religion and nationality, and became a citizen of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in January 1887. Strauss sought solace in his third wife Adele Deutsch, whom he married in August 1887. She encouraged his creative talent to flow once more in his later years, resulting in many famous compositions, such as the operettas &quot;Der Zigeunerbaron&quot; and &quot;Waldmeister&quot; and the waltzes &quot;Kaiser-Walzer&quot; Op. 437, &quot;Kaiser Jubiläum&quot; Op. 434, and &quot;Klug Gretelein&quot; Op. 462.

== Musical rivals and admirers ==
Although Strauss was the most sought-after composer of dance music in the latter half of the 19th century, Carl Michael Ziehrer and Émile Waldteufel provided stiff competition; the latter held a commanding position in Paris. Also, Philipp Fahrbach denied the younger Strauss the commanding position of the &quot;KK Hofballmusikdirektor&quot; when the latter first applied for the post. The German operetta composer Jacques Offenbach, who made his name in Paris, also posed a challenge to Strauss in the operetta field.

Strauss was admired by other prominent composers: Richard Wagner once admitted that he liked the waltz &quot;Wein, Weib und Gesang&quot; (Wine, Women and Song) Op. 333. Richard Strauss (unrelated), when writing his &quot;Rosenkavalier&quot; waltzes, said in reference to Johann Strauss, &quot;How could I forget the laughing genius of Vienna?&quot;

Johannes Brahms was a personal friend of Strauss; the latter dedicated his waltz &quot;Seid umschlungen, Millionen!&quot; (&quot;Be Embraced, You Millions!&quot;), Op. 443, to him. A story is told in biographies of both men that Strauss&#x27;s wife Adele approached Brahms with a customary request that he autograph her fan. It was usual for the composer to inscribe a few measures of his best-known music, and then sign his name. Brahms, however, inscribed a few measures from the &quot;Blue Danube&quot;, and then wrote beneath it: &quot;Unfortunately, NOT by Johannes Brahms.&quot;

== Stage works ==
The most famous of Strauss&#x27;s operettas are &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;, &quot;Eine Nacht in Venedig&quot;, and &quot;Der Zigeunerbaron&quot;. There are many dance pieces drawn from themes of his operettas, such as &quot;Cagliostro-Walzer&quot; Op. 370 (from &quot;Cagliostro in Wien&quot;), &quot;O Schöner Mai&quot; Walzer Op. 375 (from &quot;Prinz Methusalem&quot;), &quot;Rosen aus dem Süden&quot; Walzer Op. 388 (from &quot;Das Spitzentuch der Königin&quot;), and &quot;Kuss-Walzer&quot; op. 400 (from &quot;Der lustige Krieg&quot;), that have survived obscurity and become well-known. Strauss also wrote an opera, &quot;Ritter Pázmán&quot;, and was in the middle of composing a ballet, &quot;Aschenbrödel&quot;, when he died in 1899.

== Death and legacy ==
Strauss often suffered from a variety of lifelong health problems, including hypochondria, several phobias, and bronchial catarrh. In late May of 1899, he developed a respiratory illness which developed into pleuropneumonia, and on 3 June 1899 he died in Vienna, at the age of 73. He was buried in the Zentralfriedhof. At the time of his death, he was still composing his ballet &quot;Aschenbrödel&quot;.

As a result of the efforts by Clemens Krauss, who performed a special all-Strauss programme in 1929 with the Vienna Philharmonic, Strauss&#x27;s music is now regularly performed at the annual Vienna New Year&#x27;s Concert. Distinguished Strauss interpreters include Willi Boskovsky, who carried on the &quot;&quot; tradition of conducting with violin in hand, as was the Strauss family custom, as well as Herbert von Karajan, Carlos Kleiber, Lorin Maazel, Zubin Mehta and Riccardo Muti. In addition, the Wiener Johann Strauss Orchester, which was formed in 1966, pays tribute to the touring orchestras which once made the Strauss family so famous. In 1987 Dutch violinist and conductor André Rieu also created a Johann Strauss Orchestra.

Eduard Strauss surprisingly wound up the Strauss Orchestra on 13 February 1901 after concerts in 840 cities around the globe, and pawned the instruments. The orchestra&#x27;s last violins were destroyed in the firestorm of the Second World War.

Most of the Strauss works that are performed today may once have existed in a slightly different form, as Eduard Strauss destroyed much of the original Strauss orchestral archives in a furnace factory in Vienna&#x27;s Mariahilf district in 1907. Eduard, then the only surviving brother of the three, took this drastic precaution after agreeing to a pact between himself and brother Josef that whoever outlived the other was to destroy their works. The measure was intended to prevent the Strauss family&#x27;s works from being claimed by another composer. This may also have been fueled by Strauss&#x27;s rivalry with another of Vienna&#x27;s popular waltz and march composers, Carl Michael Ziehrer.

Two museums in Vienna are dedicated to Johann Strauss II. His residence in the Praterstrasse, where he lived in the 1860s, is now part of the Vienna Museum. The Strauss Museum is about the whole family, with a focus on Johann Strauss II.

== Portrayals in the media ==
The lives of the Strauss dynasty members are the subject of several film and television features, such as &quot;The Great Waltz&quot; (1938), remade in 1972; &quot;The Strauss Family&quot; (1972); &quot;The Strauss Dynasty&quot; (1991) and &quot;Strauss, the King of 3/4 Time&quot; (1995). Many other films used his works and melodies. Alfred Hitchcock made a biographical film of Strauss in 1934 called &quot;Waltzes from Vienna&quot;. 

After a trip to Vienna, Walt Disney was inspired to create four feature films. One of those was &quot;The Waltz King&quot;, a loosely adapted biopic of Strauss, which aired as part of &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; in the U.S. in 1963.

=== Penn Wynne Civic Association ===

The Penn Wynne Civic Association (&quot;PWCA&quot;) is dedicated to serving Penn Wynne residents. The organization defines the boundaries of Penn Wynne as the Delaware County line to the west, Remington Road to the north, Lancaster Avenue to the east and City Avenue to the south.

The PWCA is a community organization, not a political organization. The PWCA&#x27;s goal is to remain neutral on political matters. However, the PWCA has on occasion taken up community causes that have broad support. For example, in the past, the PWCA has opposed Lankenau Hospital&#x27;s proposed access route through Manoa Road and has been active in promoting public safety in the Penn Wynne community.

The PWCA holds an annual Fourth of July parade in the neighborhood. The parade route goes through the Penn Wynne area before ending at the Penn Wynne Elementary School. When the parade ends, the PWCA hosts a Fourth of July celebration, where games are provided for children in the neighborhood, food is sold, and awards are given to community leaders.

In addition to the annual Fourth of July parade, the PWCA holds an annual meeting in October, where the PWCA usually provides a forum for officials running for elective office.

The PWCA holds its monthly board meetings every first Thursday of the month at 7:30 pm at the Penn Wynne Library on Overbrook Parkway.

=== Jewish community ===

Penn Wynne has a large Jewish population consisting of many Orthodox Jews. It has been a popular destination of many Jews leaving the adjacent Philadelphia neighborhood of Overbrook Park. Congregation Beth Hamedrosh, an Orthodox synagogue that had been situated in Overbrook Park since 1958, bought a property in Penn Wynne in 2000. Following the process of getting zoning permits and fundraising, groundbreaking for the new synagogue building was started in May 2006. A ceremonial ground breaking was held on June 11, 2006. Rabbis spoke, as did former Lower Merion Township Commissioner Lance Rogers, US Representative Jim Gerlach, and Pennsylvania Assemblyman Daylin Leach. The synagogue moved from its temporary location in Overbrook Park into the new site at 200 Haverford Road upon the completion of the building on May 31, 2007. The first weekday services were held on the evening of May 31. The sanctuary of the new building, now attached to the house originally on the property, was used for the inaugural Shabbat services of June 1–2. A gala celebration event took place on Sunday, June 3, which featured the marching of Torah scrolls from the local Jewish Community Center along Haverford Road to the new site following speeches by rabbis, Commissioner Rogers, Assemblyman Leach, and the President of the synagogue, followed by food and dancing with live music in the sanctuary.

Chabad of Penn Wynne, originally located in Rabbi Zalman Gerber&#x27;s house, moved to a store front on Manoa Road across the street from the new synagogue building of Congregation Beth Hamedrosh soon after the latter moved in, but Chabad moved out three years later following the termination of the storefront lease at the end of May 2010. In the same Manoa Road storefront block, for a short time in 2007, there was also Just Chill, a kosher water ice and ice cream store. On June 5, 2010, Chabad of Penn Wynne began to hold Shabbat services at the Family Hall of the local Jewish Community Center. Chabad attracted many new Chabad families from out of town and many of them moved to Overbrook Park. Chabad had to relocate due to the coronavirus pandemic and starting with Rosh Hashana in September, 2020, Chabad is now across City Line Avenue in Overbrook Park in the same shopping center that is home to New York Bagels. After 13 years with no synagogue, Overbrook Park again has a synagogue.

The Jewish community on both sides of City Avenue, the border between Philadelphia and Montgomery County, are considered to be one unit and are connected by an eruv, a wire attached to the telephone and electric poles which allows religious Jews to carry things on Shabbat.

In addition to the Orthodox Jewish amenities, Penn Wynne is home to the Kaiserman branch of the Jewish Community Center.

<text>Perkiomen Township is a township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2010 census, the township population was 9,139, which represents a 28.8% increase from the 2000 total of 7,093 residents. Governmentally, it is a township of the second class, governed by a board of supervisors. It is part of the Perkiomen Valley School District. Perkiomen Township includes an abundance of history that goes as far back as to the first tribes who inhabited the area. This township started with the inhabitants of the Lenni-Lenape Tribe and progressed in many ways into what it is today.

== History ==
The Perkiomen Valley was first inhabited by the Lenni-Lenape Tribe and was declared part of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on March 4, 1681, by King Charles II.

In 1720, the first copper mine in Pennsylvania was located near Schwenksville. Perkiomen Valley provided the colonists and the Native Americans a rich place to grow crops and livestock, which would later feed the troops during the Revolutionary War. George Washington&#x27;s troops were stationed in Valley Forge during the American Revolutionary War. One of the notable residents of the Perkiomen Valley was John James Audubon, a French-American ornithologist noted for his paintings and drawings of birds.

In 1784, Montgomery County was formed with land that was previously owned by the city of Philadelphia. Nearly a century later in 1879 Limerick Township was created and in 1886 the Skippack and Perkiomen Townships split into Skippack Township and Perkiomen Township. Perkiomen Township later split into Lower Perkiomen Township and Upper Perkiomen Township. Collegeville and Trappe are two towns in Montgomery County that were purchased by Ursinus College in 1869 and were later included in Upper Providence Township in 1896. In 1903, Schwenksville was incorporated into the Perkiomen Township.

At the 1990 census, nearly 59,000 people lived in the Perkiomen Valley. Limerick Township contains the Nuclear Power Plant that produces electricity for the Perkiomen Valley and is owned by PECO. Many businesses that consider expanding to the suburbs of Philadelphia look towards the Perkiomen Valley since it is one of the major areas that are rapidly developing into a powerhouse of the suburbs of Philadelphia. They are also moving to the Perkiomen Valley because the businesses are able to escape many problems that having a business in Philadelphia creates and they are able to attract more skilled workers to their companies allowing them to grow.

=== Early living styles ===
The Perkiomen Valley was once referred to as the “Goschenhoppen”, named after the Northern American people who referred to themselves as Lenape. The vast majority of settlers were German. They were of Lutheran and German reformed faith. Their language was used exclusively and eventually evolved today into what is now known as Pennsylvania Dutch. Many old roads ran through Perkiomen valley and were maintained as well as roads are today. The people that lived on the roads did all of the upkeep. Farming was one of the settler&#x27;s main ways of living until they discovered they could use their streams for operating mills. These mills were used for many different things such as gunpowder, mixing animal food, as well as cutting wood and graining flour. These mills provided the settlers with an easy way of production as well as a good source of income. The railroad was also a major transportation use. It went through many main places but ran along the Schuylkill River. Because of this major railroad, the cigar industry rose to success. This industry brought in an influx of workers, which resulted in a greater population. With more people came a more diverse civilization, as well as the construction of homes, stores, places of worship, and many more. This industry was appealing to both the artisan as well as the tradesmen, who took on the cigar business over farming.

== Perkiomen Watershed Conservacy (PWC) ==
The Perkiomen Watershed Conservancy at 362-square miles is a part of the Schuylkill River watershed. A watershed is a drainage basin that collects surface water from other running bodies of water. The Perkiomen Watershed plays a part in the Perkiomen Valley by creating a water system for this area. Originally called the Perkiomen Valley Watershed Association, it was started in 1964 to help address these poor water conditions in the Perkiomen Creek. When PWC first started it was divided between public education activities, continuing data collection, efforts to advance the idea of state water quality standards and a required degree of treatment for wastes discharged to streams. A half of century later in the first meetings, the PWC has helped clean trash from creeks, this has helped in the preserve the Spring Mountain area, this has helped educate children and adults. This program taught people about our connection to nature, how to preserve and repair riparian areas along local creeks to help reduce erosion and improve water quality.

<text>Plymouth Meeting is a census-designated place (CDP) that straddles Plymouth and Whitemarsh Townships in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. The settlement was founded in 1686.

The population of Plymouth Meeting was 6,177 in the 2010 census. Plymouth Meeting is home to the Colonial School District, the Plymouth Meeting Mall and several large office parks and shopping centers. It is home to IKEA&#x27;s U.S. headquarters. The confluence of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276), the Mid-County Expressway/&quot;Blue Route&quot; (I-476) and the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-476) at the Mid-County Interchange occur in Plymouth Meeting. This interchange contributes to regional commerce and was a major driver for business and retail development.

Plymouth Meeting is located southeast of Allentown and northwest of Philadelphia.

==History==
===17th century===
Present-day Plymouth Meeting was originally settled by members of the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, who built the Plymouth Friends Meetinghouse in 1708. They sailed from Devonshire, England, on the ship &quot;Desire&quot;, arriving in Philadelphia on June 23, 1686. The settlement takes its name from the founders&#x27; hometown of Plymouth in Devon.

===18th century===
In 1754, Benjamin Davis received a license to keep an inn on Ridge Pike at Plymouth Creek. This inn, the Seven Stars, was shown on maps as early as 1759. It was demolished in 1975 to make way for the Midcounty Expressway.

Early records indicate that one person was elected as &quot;road supervisor&quot; and tax collector. The roads were mostly dirt, and repair and maintenance was often auctioned off to the lowest bidder, usually a farmer who had large properties and kept many men and horses, and the smaller farmers worked on the roads for them.

Tax records show that many taxpayers worked out their taxes on the roads. From 1846 to 1854 the road supervisor was paid one dollar per day for his work as supervisor and collector of taxes. Men working on the roads received $.80 per day and boys received $.40 per day. For the use of a double team of horses with a wagon or cart, one was paid $1.75 per day.

During the Revolutionary War, in May 1778, the Plymouth Friends Meetinghouse served as a temporary military hospital. General George Washington, then at Valley Forge, learned that a British force intended to seize the area and cut off movement of the Continental Army. He sent Marquis de Lafayette and 2,100 troops to counter. They camped around the meetinghouse on the night before the May 19 Battle of Barren Hill. The next morning the British arrived with a massive force of 16,000, and tried to cut off any escape route. Lafayette instead took advantage of the Americans&#x27; knowledge of local roads, and escaped with minimal casualties.

Plymouth Meeting House is the name of a village situated at the intersection of the Plymouth and Perkiomen turnpikes, on the township line. On this [Plymouth] side is the meeting house, school house and four houses; and in Whitemarsh two stores, a blacksmith and wheelwright shop, post office and twenty-four houses. The houses in this village are chiefly situated along the Perkiomen or Reading pike, nearly adjoining one another, and being of stone, neatly white washed, with shady yards in front, present to the stranger and agreeable appearance. In the basement of the Library building the Methodists hold worship. This is an ancient settlement, whose history dates back nearly to the arrival of William Penn, and is marked as a village on Lewis Evans&#x27; map of 1749. The post office was established here before 1827. In 1832 there were but ten houses here. — &quot;History of Montgomery County&quot; (1858).

===19th century===

The post office was established here before 1827. In 1832, there were but ten houses here. — &quot;History of Montgomery County&quot; (1858). Slave holding was condemned by the Society of Friends in 1754. 

Few slaves were held in Plymouth Township, and only one remained by 1830. The Maulsby and Corson families were early abolitionists, sheltering runaway slaves beginning in the 1810s and turning their properties into stations on the Underground Railroad. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 increased the penalties for giving assistance to an escaped slave to six months in prison and a $1,000 fine. It allowed slavecatchers to pursue a fugitive across state lines into every U.S. state and territory. Local resident George Corson was involved in hiding Jane Johnson, whose 1855 escape exposed a loophole in the federal law. When the doors to local churches and schools were closed to Abolitionist speakers, Corson built Abolition Hall (1856) on his farm at Germantown and Butler Pikes. The hall could accommodate up to 200 people, and hosted speakers such as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Lucretia Mott, Mrs. Stephen Foster and William Lloyd Garrison.

In the late 19th century, Abolition Hall became the art studio of painter Thomas Hovenden. Married to George Corson&#x27;s daughter, Helen (Corson) Hovenden, Hovenden was best known for painting realistic scenes taken out of American life as he experienced it in the farmlands of Plymouth Meeting. His depictions of everyday life during the Civil War seem like photographs rather than oil paintings. One of his most famous paintings,“Breaking Home Ties,” (shown below) as well as several others, can be seen in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Hovenden succeeded Thomas Eakins as the principal painting instructor at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1886 after the latter was forced to resign for inappropriate use of nude models.

Growth continued for Plymouth Meeting during the 1900s which led to the advent of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the Plymouth Meeting Mall, high-rise and garden apartment complexes, industries and office buildings.

What is now Germantown Pike was ordered laid out by the Provincial Government in 1687 as a &quot;cart road&quot; from Philadelphia to Plymouth Meeting. The actual road was finished in 1804, at a cost of $11,287. A road from Plymouth Meeting to Gwynedd appears to have been built in 1751. What is now Chemical Road, following Plymouth Creek, was opened in 1759 to provide access to a new gristmill.

In the early 19th century the Hickorytown Hotel, on Germantown Pike opposite Hickory Road, was a prominent road house. Robert Kennedy, an officer in the Revolution, operated the inn in 1801. In 1806 it was kept by Frederick Dull and in 1825, Jacob Hart. In the beginning of the 19th century it was a training place for the 36th Regiment of the Pennsylvania Militia and the Second Battalion of Montgomery County. The Friendship Company for the Protection against Horse Stealing was organized there in 1807. Township elections were held there, and a post office was established there in May 1857. The Plymouth Meeting Post Office appears to have been established sometime prior to 1827.

Among early industries in Plymouth Township was the Hickorytown Forge operated by the Wood family, and a forerunner of the present Alan Wood Steel Company. The name Plymouth Furnace appears in the records about 1847 and was engaged in the manufacture of nails.

In 1863, a company named Plymouth Iron Company was organized with a capital of $30,000.00. The company purchased the property of Colwell Furnace, which is located just west of the present Colwell Lane adjoining the development known as Farmview Village.

The Plymouth Railroad was built in 1836 to serve some 20 lime kilns operating along the route between Conshohocken and Cold Point. In 1870, the line was acquired by the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and was rebuilt and extended to Oreland at a junction with the North Penn Railroad. The line was abandoned by the 1970s.

Prior to the building of the Plymouth Railroad, the Philadelphia, Germantown, and Norristown Railroad was built along the Schuylkill River through Plymouth Township and commenced operation in 1835. For most of its history, this railroad was part of the Reading Railroad system. Today these tracks are SEPTA&#x27;s Manayunk/Norristown Line.

The Schuylkill Valley Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad was built parallel to the Reading Railroad tracks along the Schuylkill River, opening for service in 1884. Rail service ended in the 1970s and the track-bed is now occupied by the multi-use (pedestrian and bicycle) Schuylkill River Trail.

The Trenton Cutoff branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad was built in 1891. The Trenton Cutoff is now owned by Norfolk Southern and is known as the Morrisville Line.

In the 1890s, electric trolley lines were built through Plymouth Meeting. The trolleys that ran on the shoulder of Germantown Pike connected Chestnut Hill and Norristown. The trolley on the shoulder of Butler Pike was a short shuttle known as the Harmanville Dinkey, running between Germantown Pike and Ridge Pike (0.7 miles). Dinkey passengers transferred to Conshohocken-bound trolleys at the corner of Ridge Pike and Butler Pike.

===20th century===
For most of their existence, the trolley lines were operated by the Reading Transit &amp; Light Company (no relation to the Reading Railroad). In addition to passengers, during the 1910s freight was handled by the RT&amp;L trolleys; an abandoned wooden track-side freight platform near the northwest corner of Germantown Pike and Butler Pike survived into the 1950s. The Harmanville Dinkey was replaced with buses in 1927. The Germantown Pike trolleys ceased operation in December 1931. The trolley that ran from Norristown to Conshohocken through Black Horse, Seven Stars and Harmanville was replaced with buses in September 1933. The roadside trolley tracks were quickly torn up and the adjacent two-lane Ridge Pike, and Butler Pike south of Ridge Pike, were widened to accommodate ever-increasing motor vehicle traffic.

The first school in the township was established by the Plymouth Meeting Society of Friends in 1780, although some records indicate an earlier school. A school was established at Cold Point in 1821. Public schools, established under the system authorized by the legislature in 1834, included Cold Point School, Plymouth Valley School, the Eight Square school, the Sandy Hill school and the North Star school.

Plymouth became a township of the first class in January 1922. Isaac J. Sheppard became township secretary from that time until his retirement in 1952. Under the new form of government the board changed from &quot;road supervisors&quot; to &quot;Township Commissioners&quot;.

In 1925, the Board of Health was organized. Plumbing inspection began in 1934. In 1939, Plymouth adopted a &quot;modern&quot; zoning ordinance. A building code ordinance was adopted. In 1947, the first subdivision ordinance was adopted. In 1952, the Township Planning Commission was created, and a Recreation Committee was established to study recreation needs.

Plymouth Township adopted a Home Rule Charter in 1972. This allows a municipality to take any governmental or administrative actions it requires, unless such actions are prohibited by general laws of the Commonwealth.

The Plymouth Meeting Historic District, Alan West Corson Homestead, Plymouth Friends Meetinghouse, and Hovenden House, Barn and Abolition Hall were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

Colonial is regarded as one of the top school districts in the state with consistently high standardized testing results. The two townships share a high school with the borough of Conshohocken.

Holy Rosary Regional Catholic School is the area Catholic school. It was formed in 2012 by the merger of Epiphany of Our Lord School in Plymouth Meeting, Our Lady of Victory in East Norriton Township, and St. Titus in Norristown.

<doc id="133401" wikidata="Q1185890" url="?curid=133401" title="Pottstown, Pennsylvania">
<text>Pottstown is a borough in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. Pottstown was laid out in 1752–53 and named Pottsgrove in honor of its founder, John Potts. The old name was abandoned at the time of the incorporation as a borough in 1815. In 1888, the limits of the borough were considerably extended. Pottstown is the center of a productive farming and dairying region.

Pottstown is located on the Schuylkill River. It is south of Allentown and northwest of Philadelphia. It is generally considered part of the Delaware Valley or Philadelphia metropolitan area.

==History==

Modern-day Pottstown is on land originally deeded to William Penn. Germans, Swedes and English were among the area&#x27;s first European settlers. After establishment of the first iron forge in 1714, Pottstown&#x27;s fortunes became tied to the iron industry, and blast furnaces for production of iron and later steel eventually opened in the area.

Iron and steel production attracted the Potts family, iron masters by trade. They established a forge and built a large home just west of the Manatawny Creek. John Potts founded a town in 1761 on part of the that he owned. It is the home of the nation&#x27;s oldest mill, Pottstown Roller Mill.

Pottsgrove grew, and in 1815 it was incorporated under the name Pottstown, becoming the second borough in Pennsylvania, after Norristown.

The Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad mainline reached Pottstown in 1838. The extension of the railroad to Mount Carbon in 1842 facilitated the movement of raw materials and finished goods that helped Pottstown&#x27;s economy grow. In a few years after the extension of the railroad, the population grew from 600 to 1,850. Pottstown&#x27;s metal production grew; steel from the borough was used in the Panama Canal and Golden Gate Bridge.

In 1944, the borough adopted a city manager form of government. By 1964, the borough saw the need to reorganize the municipal government. At the time, it had one of the largest borough councils in the state, with 20 members. This was reduced to seven members in redrawn wards.

The High Street Historic District, Old Pottstown Historic District, Pottsgrove Mansion, Grubb Mansion, Jefferson Elementary School, Pottstown Roller Mill, Reading Railroad Pottstown Station, and Henry Antes House are on the National Register of Historic Places.

Pottstown has a city manager form of government with a mayor and a seven-member borough council. The mayor is Stephanie A. Henrick and the borough manager is Justin Keller.

The borough is part of the Fourth Congressional District (represented by Democrat Rep. Madeleine Dean), the 146th State House District (represented by Democrat Rep. Joe Ciresi), and the 24th State Senate District (represented by Republican Sen. Tracy Pennycuick).

<text>Skippack (Pennsylvania German: &quot;Schippach&quot;), originally named &quot;Van Bebber&#x27;s Township&quot;, is a census-designated place (CDP) in Skippack Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,758 at the 2010 census.

==History==
In 1683, the Original 13, thirteen families from the lower Rhine River arrived at Philadelphia aboard the Concord, on October 6 of that year. These families were primarily linen weavers, but also knew how to farm. These first German immigrants left their homeland of Germany because of persecution they experienced as religious Anabaptist Mennonite and Quakers from the Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed Churches. Upon arriving at Philadelphia, the families were greeted by the representative of the Frankfort Land Company, a highly educated German lawyer, Franz Daniel Pastorius, who was charged with the authority to make land transactions with the thirteen families. After inspecting different areas of the vicinity of Philadelphia, the families settled on the land that was to become the villages of Germantown, Summerhousen, Crefeld, and Germantownship.

Within approximately twenty years Anabaptist German farmers in the Electorate of the Palatinate began to immigrate to Philadelphia in such numbers that Benjamin Franklin wrote an editorial fearing that Pennsylvania would soon become a majority German-speaking colony. As the Germantown area became more densely settled, there was a departure of some of the original families of Germantown to an area twenty miles west of Philadelphia further up the Schuylkill, purchasing land from the father in-law of Herman Isacks op den Graeff (an original settler of Germantown), who had earlier purchased approximately seven thousand acres. These German Mennonites brought the linen making business to the community, along with their farming skills. They settled on farms in the vicinity of Perkiomen Creek and Skippack Creek, up to a point where travel by boat became impossible because of shallow water. This point is where Skippack Creek crosses Skippack Pike in Skippack Township. The origin of the name &quot;Skippack&quot; came from early German settlers, they originally spelled it Schippach, named after a town of the same name in Bavaria.

Skippack Township was originally named &quot;Van Bebber&#x27;s Township&quot; after Matthias van Bebber, to whom the original land patent was issued in 1702 by William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania. The name later changed to &quot;Skippack and Perkiomen Township&quot; until the township was split into two townships. Skippack Township is home to one of the oldest homes still standing in the area, the Indenhofen (De Haven) Farmstead, built in circa 1720. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, as the Warren Z. Cole House. Originally, the Indenhofen Farm consisted of .

In 1795, Jacob Reiff bought a property at Store Road and Skippack Pike and opened a general merchandise store. In 1800, the store was sold to Jacob Sorver, who ran it until 1854. A post office was established in 1827 with weekly mail delivery by the Kutztown stagecoach.

The Souderton, Skippack &amp; Fairview Electric Railway Co. was formed in 1901 to provide trolley service from Norristown, through Trooper and Worcester to Souderton. Trolley service to Skippack began in 1908. Harleysville was reached in 1912; the line to Souderton was never completed. The railway was renamed the Montgomery County Rapid Transit Company and later the Montgomery Transit Company. In 1923, its name was changed once again to the Skippack &amp; Perkiomen Transit Company. The &quot;Wogglebug&quot; trolleys ran on the south shoulder of Skippack Pike through the village (a sidewalk was on the north side). Buses replaced the trolleys in 1925. In 1940 the bus service ended.

<text>Johann Baptist Strauss I (; ; 14 March 1804 – 25 September 1849), also known as Johann Strauss Sr., the Elder or the Father (), was an Austrian composer of the Romantic Period. He was famous for his light music, namely waltzes, polkas, and galops, which he popularized alongside Joseph Lanner, thereby setting the foundations for his sons—Johann, Josef and Eduard—to carry on his musical dynasty. He is best known for his composition of the Radetzky March (named after Joseph Radetzky von Radetz).

==Life and work==
Johann Strauss was born in Leopoldstadt (now in Vienna). Strauss&#x27;s parents, Franz Borgias Strauss (10 October 1764 – 5 April 1816) and Barbara Dollmann (3 December 1770 – 28 August 1811), were innkeepers (). He was born a Roman Catholic. Strauss had a Jewish grandfather, Johann Michael Strauss (1720–1800), who converted to Catholicism.

Strauss’ mother died of &#x27;creeping fever&#x27; when he was seven and five years later his father drowned, possibly as a result of suicide, in the Danube river. Strauss&#x27; guardian, the tailor Anton Müller, placed him as an apprentice to the bookbinder, Johann Lichtscheidl; Strauss took lessons in the violin and viola in addition to fulfilling his apprenticeship. Contrary to a story later told by his son Johann Strauss II, Strauss successfully completed his bookbinder apprenticeship in 1822. He also studied music with Johann Polischansky during his apprenticeship and eventually managed to secure a place in a local orchestra, headed by . Strauss left the orchestra to join a popular string quartet known as the &quot;Lanner Quartet&quot;, formed by his future rivals Joseph Lanner and the Drahanek brothers, Karl and Johann. This string quartet playing Viennese waltzes and rustic German dances expanded into a small string orchestra in 1824.

Strauss became deputy conductor of the orchestra to assist Lanner in commissions after it became so popular during the Fasching of 1824. Strauss was soon placed in command of a second smaller orchestra which was formed as a result of the success of the parent orchestra. In 1825, he decided to form his own band and began to write music (chiefly, dance music) for it to play. He realized that he could also possibly emulate the success of Lanner in addition to putting an end to his financial struggles. By so doing, he would have made Lanner a serious rival although the rivalry did not entail hostile consequences. The musical competition was very productive for the development of the waltz as well as other dance music in Vienna.

Strauss soon became one of the best-known and well loved dance composers in Vienna. During the carnival of 1826, Strauss inaugurated his long line of triumphs by introducing his band to the public of Vienna at the in the suburb of Roßau where his Täuberln-Walzer (Op. 1) at once established his reputation. He toured with his band to Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Britain. The conducting reins and management of this Strauss Orchestra would eventually be passed on to the hands of his sons until its disbandment by Eduard Strauss in 1901.

On a trip to France in 1837 Strauss heard the quadrille and began to compose them himself, becoming largely responsible for introducing that dance to Austria in the 1840 Fasching, where it became very popular. It was this very trip (in 1837) which has proved Strauss&#x27; popularity with audiences from different social backgrounds and this paved the way to forming an ambitious plan to perform his music in England for the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838. Strauss also adapted various popular melodies of his day into his works so as to ensure a wider audience, as evidenced in the incorporation of the &quot;Oberon&quot; overture into his early waltz, &quot;Wiener Carneval&quot;, Op. 3, and also the (at the time former) French national anthem &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; into his &quot;Paris-Walzer&quot;, Op. 101.
Strauss married Maria Anna Streim (1801–1870) in 1825 in the Roman Catholic Lichtental Parish Church in Vienna. The marriage was relatively unhappy because of his prolonged absences caused by frequent tours abroad which led to a gradual alienation. They had six children: Johann (born 1825), Josef (born 1827), Anna (born 1829), Therese (born 1831), Ferdinand (born 1834 and living only ten months) and Eduard (born 1835). Eduard&#x27;s first son was Johann Strauss III.

The family home was called &#x27;Hirschenhaus&#x27; but was better known in Vienna as the &#x27;Goldener Hirsch&#x27; (The Golden Stag). Strauss was a strict disciplinarian and demanded that none of his sons pursue careers in music, despite their display of musical talent. Johann Junior was to study banking, likewise his brother Josef Strauss was destined for a military career, whereas the youngest Eduard Strauss was expected to join the Austrian consulate.

By 1834 Strauss had taken a mistress, Emilie Trampusch, with whom he had eight children. When her husband openly acknowledged his paternity of a daughter born to Emilie in 1844, Maria Anna sued for divorce. With the ending of the marriage, Anna Strauss determined to further Johann Strauss II&#x27;s musical career, allowing him to develop his skills as a composer.

Despite family problems, Strauss senior continued to tour frequently and was always prepared to write novelty pieces for numerous charitable organizations. His waltzes were gradually developed from a rustic peasant dance into one which posterity would recognize as the Viennese waltz. They were written in three-quarter time with a short introduction; often with little or no reference to the later chain of five two-part waltz structure; usually appended with a short coda and concluded in a stirring finish, although his son Johann Strauss II expanded the waltz structure and utilized more instruments than his father. While he did not possess a musical talent as rich as his eldest son&#x27;s, nor a business mind as astute, he was among the handful of early waltz composers along with Joseph Lanner to actively write pieces with individual titles — with the view to boost sales of their sheet music — which enabled music enthusiasts to easily recognize those pieces. In fact, during his performances at the Sperl-Ballroom in Vienna, where he established his name, he actively pursued the concept of collecting a fixed entrance fee from the patrons of the ballroom instead of the old practice of passing around a collection plate where income was reliant on the goodwill of the patrons.
Johann Strauss II often played his father&#x27;s works and openly declared his admiration of them, although it was no secret to the Viennese that their rivalry was intense, with the press at that time fueling it. Johann Strauss I refused to play again at the Dommayer&#x27;s Casino, which offered his son his conducting debut, and was to tower over his son during his lifetime in terms of career advancement, but Strauss II was to eclipse him in terms of popularity in the classical repertoire. In 1846, Johann Strauss I was awarded the honorary title of &quot;K.K. Hofballmusikdirektor&quot; (Director of Music for the Imperial and Royal Court Balls) by Emperor Ferdinand I.

Strauss died in Vienna on 25 September 1849 at the age of 45 from scarlet fever contracted from one of his illegitimate children. He was buried at the Döblinger cemetery beside his friend Joseph Lanner. In 1904, both of their remains were transferred to the graves of honour at the Zentralfriedhof. The former Döbling Cemetery is now a Strauss-Lanner Park. Hector Berlioz paid tribute to the &#x27;Father of the Viennese Waltz&#x27; by commenting that &quot;Vienna without Strauss is like Austria without the Danube&quot;.

Nita Strauss, guitarist with Alice Cooper and others, claims to be a descendant of Johann Strauss.

<text>Souderton is a borough in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 7,246 in 2022 according to the Census Bureau.

Souderton formerly hosted the end of the annual Bucks County Classic, a professional bicycle race.

==History==
Souderton occupies a land that was historically inhabited by the Lenni Lenape for thousands of years. The first Welsh settlers, John Mathias and Thomas Morgan, established their settlement in the vicinity around 1710, near the intersection of School Lane and Chestnut Street where Souderton stands today. The town was originally named Welshtown, because of its Welsh influence.

The first person to own land in what is now Souderton was a man by the name of George Stuart. He built a log cabin in or around what is now known as West Street Park. Stuart owned many acres and began selling them off in tracts. In 1734, he sold 1,000 acres to George Cressman, which eventually became the Borough of Souderton. This parcel of land was approximately bounded by what are now Reliance Road, County Line Road, Cherry Lane, and Cowpath Road.

In 1755, 225 acres were sold to German immigrant Johannes &#x27;John&#x27; Benner. He constructed a log residence approximately 200 feet from a stream that flows into the Skippack Creek.

In 1835, Henry O. Souder and his spouse Hannah established their initial homestead situated at the intersection of present-day Main and Chestnut Streets. Souder, known for his entrepreneurial spirit, also possessed a lumber mill located on Main Street. The name Souderton is prefigured in a map of 1847 as Souder&#x27;s Lumberyard, as Henry had own a lumber mill located on main street.

Souderton initially flourished as an agricultural community, primarily focused on farming activities. However, the introduction of the railroad facilitated the borough&#x27;s expansion, fostering both industrial growth and community development. Industries such as textiles and cigar manufacturing contributed to Souderton&#x27;s prosperity and population increase. Several major cigar manufacturers established factories in the area during this period.

On June 6, 1887, residents of Souderton applied for a charter of incorporation to the Montgomery County Court. The charter was granted on December 15, 1887. At the time of incorporation, the population was about 600.

The Souderton Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Highways and roads====

As of 2006 there were of public roads in Souderton, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the borough.

Pennsylvania Route 113 passes through Souderton along Main Street and Broad Street, heading southwest to Harleysville and northeast to Silverdale. PA 113 has an interchange with the Pennsylvania Route 309 freeway to the northeast of Souderton; PA 309 heads north to Quakertown and south to Montgomeryville.

====Railroads past and present====

A rail line dating from the early 1900s (the Reading Company&#x27;s former Bethlehem Branch) runs through Souderton connecting to Telford, Perkasie, Quakertown, and Bethlehem to the north and Hatfield and Lansdale to the south. This line was taken over for passenger operation from the Reading until 1981. Still active for freight, the Pennsylvania Northeastern Railroad operates through Souderton on these former SEPTA tracks. Every August, Pennsylvania Northeastern Railroad partners with New Hope and Ivyland Railroad to provide excursions to Souderton Station. Trains only use the station as a turnaround point and do not use its platform for passengers.

====Interurban trolley====
From 1901 until 1951, an interurban electric trolley, the Lehigh Valley Transit, operated hourly service from Souderton north to Allentown and south to Philadelphia. Its Souderton station was at the northwest corner of Broad and Main streets opposite the steam railroad Reading&#x27;s Souderton station. The LVT ran north in the middle of Main Street, turned onto Summit Street and crossed the Reading on the Summit Street bridge, then angled toward Telford, its next stop. LVT had a large maintenance facility with car storage tracks reached by a track that branched from Summit Street. That building was turned into a local supermarket before it burned down in the 1990s. The LVT carried heavy passenger loads during World War 2 when gas rationing reduced automobile use, but when the war ended, passenger count collapsed and the line abandoned and began running buses.

On September 21, 1915, an incident occurred involving a freight trolley operated by the Lehigh Valley Transit Co. The trolley lost control and derailed at the intersection of Penn Street and Broad in Souderton, where the tracks made a 90-degree turn. Tragically, one of the two individuals aboard, conductor Harry W. Utt, succumbed to the accident.

====Bus====
SEPTA Suburban Bus Route 132 serves Souderton, heading north to Telford and south to Hatfield, Lansdale, and the Montgomery Mall in Montgomeryville.

<doc id="133418" wikidata="Q5485568" url="?curid=133418" title="Towamencin Township, Pennsylvania">
<text>Towamencin Township is a home rule township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 17,578 at the 2010 census. It is part of the North Penn School District and the North Penn Valley region that is centered around the borough of Lansdale. Towamencin has residential neighborhoods, historic farmhouses, recreational facilities, many schools, and open spaces. The community is a mix of residential, commercial and rural development. The Township is centrally located within Montgomery County with easy access to the Pennsylvania Turnpike’s Northeast Extension.

==Etymology==
The name Towamencin is of Native American origin, although there exists some disagreement about the name&#x27;s history. Some early sources, such as the 1850 United States census, record the township&#x27;s name as &quot;Towamensing.&quot; The Towamensing name appears on local tax records as late as 1922, although the 1920 census records the township with the modern spelling of Towamencin. According to &quot;History of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, Volume II&quot;, both the Towamensing and Towamencin spellings were in use circa 1884. The same source cites Towamensing as the original spelling, but notes that the Towamencin spelling was in use for government records in Norristown. It is unclear when the modern spelling of Towamencin was universally adopted.

The name &quot;Towamensing&quot; is Lenape in origin and means either &quot;the place of feeding cattle&quot; or &quot;pasture land,&quot; or &quot;a fording place at the falls&quot;. However, an alternative source claims that, while the name Towamencin is of Native American origin, it instead means &quot;poplar tree.&quot;

A third source claims that the name was derived from an existing Native American name for Towamencin Creek, rather than the creek being named for the township. This claim is supported by the petition to erect the Township, which indicated that &quot;The desire of the Subscibers is that the township may be called Touamensen being the Indian name of the Creek yt springs &amp; runs through the same.&quot;

An alternative local legend is that a local landowner, Heinrich Fry, purchased some land near what is now known as the Towamencin Creek. On this tract of land was a Native village whose chief spoke broken English. He observed one day two men clearing trees near the creek and said &quot;Towha-men-seen&quot;, meaning &quot;Two men seen.&quot; As the legend goes, the chief&#x27;s pronunciation stuck, and is how Towamencin got its name.

==History==

===Founding===
The first settlers, of German, Welsh, and Dutch descent, arrived in Towamencin Township around the turn of the 18th century. They mainly pursued agricultural endeavors to sustain their livelihood.

The first grant of land in Towamencin Township was in 1703 from William Penn&#x27;s Commissioners to Benjamin Furley on June 8. The Commissioners granted 1,000 acres (4 km2) to him. On June 17 of that same year, Abraham Tennis and Jan Lucken bought the property from him, and then divided the land in half in 1709. The Edward Morgan Log House stands on land that was part of 600 acres (2.4 km2) granted to Griffith Jones by the Commissioners. Edward Morgan purchased 309 acres (1.25 km2) of this land, which included an existing &quot;dwelling house&quot;, from Griffith Jones on February 26, 1708. In 1720, his daughter Sarah, who in 1734 would give birth to the famous frontiersman Daniel Boone, married Squire Boone.
The land containing the house was then deeded to John Morgan, son of Edward, on August 23, 1723, as part of a 104-acre (.42 km2) tract.

Towamencin Township was erected when the Court of Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia County confirmed a petition presented to its session held on March 3, 1728/1729 (O.S.) [March 14, 1729 (N.S.)], requesting the formation of a township of about 5,500 acres.

In 1734, there were 32 landholders within the Township, with William Tennis having the most area at 250 acres (1 km2).

===The Indians of Towamencin===
The American Indians who inhabited the area were the Lenni Lenape. They lived in Pennsylvania, as well as Delaware, New Jersey, and parts of Maryland. They were divided into three tribes: the Turtle, Turkeys, and Wolf, which were subdivided into clans, each clan having a name representing the character and situation of the tribe as a whole.

The Indians of Towamencin Township are of the Delaware Nation. They had a settlement in the southwest section of the Township along the Towamencin Creek. They established friendly relations with the settlers when they came to the Township. There are some accounts of violence attributed to the Indians, but they cannot be proven and are probably fictional. There are many accounts of Indians helping to tend the sick, and trading food and goods with the settlers.

It is not recorded when the tribes of Indians left Towamencin; it is suspected they left after the Revolutionary War.

The Maltese Cross of the Towamencin Volunteer Fire Company has an American Indian in the center.

===American Revolutionary War===
Pennsylvania is known as the Keystone State for its role in the Revolution, and as one of the oldest settlements during the time, Towamencin Township played a part: the Township had encampments of soldiers, had many citizens that served, and was the retreating place for General Washington and his troops after the Battle of Germantown.

The Continental Army troops were in Towamencin from October 8, 1777, to October 16, 1777 and camped in the Northern section of the Township. The Township provided a secure area to rest, without fear of surprise attack by the British.

Washington commandeered Frederick Wampole&#x27;s house to establish his quarters and conducted military duties from there. The house was located on Wambold Road.

General Francis Nash was wounded at the Battle of Germantown and was carried from Germantown to Towamencin. He was cared for in a house, according to Washington&#x27;s writings, located &quot;a mile-and-a-quarter south of the Great North Wales Turnpike,&quot; now Sumneytown Pike, along with other wounded men of the Battle of Germantown. He died two days later and is buried at the present-day Towamencin Mennonite Church cemetery, known then as the Towamencin Mennonite Meetinghouse.

It was reported that Henry Cassel, whose land was used as an encampment by the Colonists, submitted to the Continental Congress an estimate of damages to his property by Washington&#x27;s Army. The damage was to 696 fence rails used for firewood. The cost to replace those rails was 8.14 pounds. It is not known whether the newly formed government paid.

===Home rule===
In May 2022, the Towamencin Board of Supervisors approved the sale of the township&#x27;s sewer system, with four in favor and one against. The privatization effort was met with opposition by some residents, and prior to the authorization of the sale, a group known as Towamencin N.O.P.E. (Neighbors Opposing Privatization Efforts) was set up in an attempt to block the move. Following the approval of the sale, Towamencin NOPE pivoted to campaigning for the township to adopt a home rule charter in an attempt to block the sale. In response to the move, the Board of Supervisors issued a statement questioning the legality of unilaterally terminating the sale, while a rival group, TRUST Towamencin, was established to oppose the adoption of home rule.

On November 8, 2022, residents of Towamencin voted in favor of forming a government study commission to draft a home rule charter. Unofficial results showed that 60% of residents voted in favor of forming the commission, and that the full slate of candidates backed by Towamencin NOPE backing the charter had been elected to the commission. In March 2023, the government study commission put forward a proposed home rule charter to be placed on the ballot during the May 16 primary. Under the proposal, the township would retain its form of government, but with provisions for increased government transparency, a prohibition on the sale of municipally-owned water systems, and allowing residents to submit initiatives or referendums to the ballot.

On May 16, 2023, residents of the township voted in favor of adopting the proposed home rule charter, with approximately 53% of voters supporting the measure. The new charter took effect on July 1, 2023.

In addition to agricultural pursuits, in the late 18th century the township was home to two inns and four mills. By 1884, while the township remained primarily agricultural, it was also home to &quot;two hotels, one store, [and] several carriage manufacturies&quot; as well as local artisans. Another mill and adjoining general store was erected in 1894, which still stands today as a restaurant.

The township is governed by a five-member Board of Supervisors, who are elected on an at-large basis and serve a six-year term of office. Elections to the Board of Supervisors take place in odd-numbered years, with elections staggered such that two seats come up for election every two years, with the exception of the sixth year in the cycle, when only one seat comes up for election. Under Section 607 of the Second Class Township Code the Board of Supervisors is &quot;charged with the general governance of the township and the execution of legislative, executive and administrative powers in order to ensure sound fiscal management and to secure the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the township.&quot; The Board of Supervisors is further empowered to appoint the township manager, as well as the membership of various boards and commissions, including the Zoning Hearing Board and the township&#x27;s Planning Commission. The Board meets twice monthly to review all issues before the township and provide policy direction to the appointed staff.

Mulvaney. In 1863, the township voted Republican by a margin of 186 to 79, and in the 1896 United States presidential election the township favored William McKinley by a margin of 245 to 36. In the 2001 municipal election, five Republicans ran for the Board of Supervisors compared to one Democrat, and between 1993 and 2021 all members of the Board of Supervisors were Republicans.

In 2008, Republicans accounted for 51% of registered voters in the township, compared to 46% in 2016 and 44% in 2019. Over the same period, the share of registered Democrats rose from 34.74% to 40.48%.

During the 2021 municipal elections, Democrat Joyce F. Snyder was also elected to the Board of Supervisors. Snyder&#x27;s victory made her the first Democrat to hold a seat on the board since 1992, and was further accompanied by the victory of Democratic nominee Melissa Fusco to the position of township auditor.

===Founding===
Edward Tanner was granted land by William Penn in the Province of Pennsylvania and named it &quot;Upper and Lower Dublin.&quot; Lower Dublin was incorporated into the City of Philadelphia following the passage of the Act of Consolidation in 1854. The &quot;upper&quot; portion has continued to exist around the original survey for the laying out and naming of Susquehanna Road.

<text>Upper Merion Township is a township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 33,613 at the 2020 U.S. Census. Located from Philadelphia, it consists of the villages of Gulph Mills, King of Prussia, Swedeland, Swedesburg, and portions of Radnor, and Wayne.

The westernmost part of the township comprises the largest part of the Valley Forge National Historical Park. The township is the home of the King of Prussia mall, the third-largest shopping mall in the United States in terms of gross leasable area. King of Prussia also contains a major office park hosting firms such as Lockheed Martin and GlaxoSmithKline.

The name Merion originates with the county of Merioneth in north Wales. &quot;Merioneth&quot; is an English-language translation of the Welsh &quot;Meirionnydd&quot;, itself named after &quot;Meirchion&quot; (or &quot;Meirion&quot;), grandson of &quot;Cunedda Wledig&quot; (b. ca. 380 A.D.), King of North Wales.

==History==
The township&#x27;s incorporation dates to 1713 when the King of Prussia Inn, the Bird-In-Hand Inn in Gulph Mills, and later the Swedes Ford Inn were required to pay 6 shillings to the Pennsylvania legislature for licenses. The King of Prussia Inn, built in 1719, captures the historical flavor of the township. It was named in honor of Frederick the Great, but became known during the Revolutionary War as a center of food and drink. An alternate story says the Inn, first called Berry&#x27;s Tavern, got its name to lure in Prussian mercenaries who spent freely.

Upper Merion Township is a township of the second class under Pennsylvania state statutes. A five-member Board of Supervisors, elected at large for staggered six-year terms, governs it. The Board passes legislation and sets overall policy for the Township. A professional township manager runs the day-to-day operations overseeing the activities of 250 full and part-time employees.

The King of Prussia Inn, Poplar Lane, the Washington Memorial Chapel, Hanging Rock and Gulph Mills Bridge are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Old Swedes Church (Christ Church) was dedicated June 25, 1760, in Swedesburg, replacing a simple log cabin dating to 1735. The original church had served as both a church and school until Christ Church was built. The stained glass windows tell the story of the history of the Swedish colony of New Sweden.

<text>Upper Providence Township is a township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2010 census, the township population was 21,219.

== History ==
William Penn, the founder and first governor of the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania, originally owned the land that is present-day Upper Providence. After selling off most of the land, he kept a large tract on the east side of the Schuylkill River, which included Upper and Lower Providence and parts of Perkiomen and Worcester. William Penn named the land “The Manor of Gilberts” after his mother&#x27;s maiden name.

The first person to settle in this area was Edward Lane, who bought 2,500 acres of land from William Penn in 1701. Edward and his wife established the Episcopal church in Lower Providence. In 1717, John Jacob Schrack came to the township from Germany. Schrack was able to convince Rev. Henry Melchior Muhlenberg to relocate to this area. Muhlenberg was the founder of the Lutheran church in the United States, the first of which was founded in Trappe.

In March 1725, the farmers formed the township, which was then called Providence and included Upper and Lower Providence.

Upper Providence Township was established in 1805 by the division of the former Providence Township along the Perkiomen Creek. In 1896, the Boroughs of Collegeville and Trappe were created from northeastern portions of the township, yielding the present township boundaries.

=== Schuylkill Canal ===
The Schuylkill Canal was built to help navigate past rapids on the Schuylkill River between Norristown and Pottstown. It was completed in 1825 and was approximately five miles long, extending from Black Rock dam (Lock 60) to Pawlings dam at the Perkiomen creek in Oaks (Lock 61).

In the 1830s, Lock 60 was doubled in size and in the 1840s, the locks were expanded to handle wider boats.

The river traffic helped the surrounding area grow. The settlement of Quincyville started at Lock 60 and the settlement of Lumberville grew at Lock 61. Lumberville thrived with stables for mules, and a general store for boat supplies. In the 1840s, these towns changed names, with Quincyville becoming Mont Clare and Lunberville becoming Port Providence, which are their current names.

With the ascendancy of railroads in the mid 19th century, boat traffic diminished. However, it was supplemented by recreational boating in the 1920s. Pleasure boats ran between Philadelphia and Reading. In the 1950s, the Army Corps of Engineers dredged the Schuylkill River to remove coal silt from upriver. The lower part of the canal was used as a holding basin for the silt.

=== Railroads ===
The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad ran through Upper Providence, transporting passengers from Philadelphia and Norristown to Pottstown, Reading and finally Pottsville. Before the railroad, this trip had to be taken on stagecoaches or by horse. The railroad was constructed starting in Reading and down to Pottstown which opened in 1939. The last section between Bridgeport and Philadelphia was completed in 1842. This rail line is still in use for freight only.

The Perkiomen Railroad was a second railroad passed through Upper Providence, running from Oaks in the south to Collegeville and then Allentown in the state&#x27;s Lehigh Valley region in the north. The Perkiomen Railroad opened in 1868. The railroad later closed and is now part of the Perkiomen Trail converted through the Rails to Trails initiative.

The Black Rock Bridge and Schuylkill Navigation Canal, Oakes Reach Section were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

<text>Upper Salford Township is a township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,299 at the 2010 census.

==Historical background==

Upper Salford, founded in 1727, is part of the original Salford Township. In 1741, Salford Township split into Marlborough, Upper Salford, Lower Salford, and part of Franconia Township. In 1892, Upper Salford further split into the present day Salford and Upper Salford townships. The village of Woxall was originally known as Kroppestettel, which in Pennsylvania Dutch means Crow-town. The village was later named Mechanicsville. By the end of the eighteenth century, the town contained a hotel and restaurant, town hall, shoe shop, wheelwright, and 12 homes. The village kept the name Mechanicsville until 1888 when a post office was established. A new name needed to be selected for the post office because another Pennsylvania town had the same name. After much discussion, residents submitted the name Noxall, “Knocks All,” to postal authorities. The name had been read on the side of a bar of a box of soap in the village store. Evidently, they misread the “N” for a “W” and approved the name Woxall for the post office.

The Village of Woxall grew up near the Old Goschenhoppen Church, erected in 1744, where Lutheran and Reformed congregations met. With the arrival of the railroad in 1868, Salfordville, which prospered without railroad or trolley, grew around an old inn. By 1877 it contained a post office, general store, cigar factory, and 19 homes.

The Village of Salfordville was originally situated on a main route between the &quot;upper country&quot; and Philadelphia, from which it was a distant thirty-five miles, and became an early settlement in Montgomery County. This early route was opened in June 1728 and locally passed through Skippack, Lederachsville, and Salfordville on the way to Sumneytown. Along the north-eastern side of Old Skippack Road within the township milestones depicting the distances to Philadelphia may still be seen.

Salfordville was a bustling village in the 1700s and 1800s with a thriving market for livestock and farm goods. Surrounded by farms, the small village had two hotels, a one-room schoolhouse, a cigar factory, a blacksmith livery and a general store. Salfordville was also home to Christopher Dock who was an early German educator, artist, and historian. In fact, the Christopher Dock White Oak tree, estimated to be close to 300 years old, was destroyed by a storm and Upper Salford Township residents replanted a White Oak tree in its place to mark this historic landmark. Finally, genealogy records indicate an early resident, John Michel Weigel, was born here in 1689.

Other villages include Bergey, known in 1893 as Branchville, and Salford, called Rudy in the early 1900s. These two villages, along with Woxall and Salfordville, were noted for their general stores that sold a variety of items including fine clocks, furniture, barrel molasses, and quilting thread. Along the Perkiomen Creek, the village of Salford was once known as Salford Station when the railroad still came through the township.

Farming, particularly dairy farming, was once a primary occupation in Upper Salford. The number of dairy farmers declined as milking techniques modernized and herds became larger. Today, open space is used primarily for crop farming. Spring Mount, once called Stone Hill, was and is a recreation area for the township and the region. At the end of the 1800s, Solomon K. Grimley established an amusement a park, named after himself, on the west end of the mountain. Only a short walk from the railroad, the park included an observatory, picnic and playground facilities, dance floor for hoedowns, and areas for horseshoes and croquet. For a while it proudly displayed the clock from the former County Courthouse in Norristown. For years the Spring Mountain House was a widely known resort. The park was abandoned when it was sold in 1901. Even with the close of the park, the area continued as a popular summer destination for railroad passengers. Today, Spring Mountain is the only downhill ski area in Montgomery County. Prior to becoming a recreation area, however, the mountain was quarried on a commercial basis for its black granite rock. Many Belgian blocks cut from the quarry were hauled by the Perkiomen Railroad to Philadelphia to pave the city&#x27;s streets. The name Stone Hill died out when the quarry was abandoned around the 1920s.
