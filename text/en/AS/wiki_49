<text>Höganäs Municipality (&quot;Höganäs kommun&quot;) is one of 290 municipalities of Sweden, in Skåne County in the southern part of the country. Its seat is located in the city of Höganäs.

The rural municipality Höganäs, in which the first &quot;municipalsamhälle&quot; (a kind of borough managing matters of urban character) of Sweden had been established in 1875, received the title of a city in 1936. In 1967 it was merged with &quot;Väsby&quot;. The present municipality was created with the reform in 1971 when the city was amalgamated with &quot;Brunnby&quot; and &quot;Jonstorp&quot;.

==Geography==
The municipality is located on the Kullen peninsula, the extreme part of which is known as the nature reserve Kullaberg hill, with the picturesque villages of Mölle and Arild. The nature reserve is an Important Bird Area of Sweden and a location of several rare plant species.

The Kullen Lighthouse, the most powerful lighthouse in Scandinavia, is located on the western point of Kullaberg. The nature reserve is also home to a series of wooden structures along the coastline, which were begun by artist by Lars Vilks in 1980, and which have become known as Nimis. This is a tourist attraction despite being unauthorised by the Swedish authorities and therefore not marked on maps or signposted.

===Localities===
There were eight localities in the municipality as of 2018. The municipal seat is marked in bold.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Höganäs Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 27,560 residents, including 21,308 Swedish citizens of voting age. 38.5% voted for the left coalition and 60.3% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Elections==
Below are the results since the 1973 municipal reform listed. Between 1988 and 1998 the Sweden Democrats&#x27; results were not published by the SCB due to the party&#x27;s small size nationwide. &quot;Turnout&quot; denotes the percentage of the electorate casting a ballot, but &quot;Votes&quot; only applies to valid ballots cast.

===Riksdag===
Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party. &quot;Elected&quot; is the total number of percentage points from the municipality that went to parties who were elected to the Riksdag.

<text>Hörby Municipality (&quot;Hörby kommun&quot;) is a municipality in the central part of Skåne County in southern Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Hörby.

The present municipality consists of ten original entities merged to each other in 1952, 1969 and 1974.

==Geography==
The geography is varied with a few forests, some lakes and streams and farmland and even wildlife. Hörby is one of the most meadow-filled municipalities in Sweden.

===Localities===
There are 3 urban areas (also called a Tätort or locality) in Hörby Municipality. In the table they are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2005. The municipal seat is in bold characters.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Hörby Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 15,716 inhabitants, including 11,943 Swedish citizens of voting age. 33.2% voted for the left coalition and 65.8% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==History==
Some historians claim Hörby was founded in the 9th century A.D., but the truth is that no one knows exactly how old the village is. During the Middle Ages Hörby evolved into a centre of commerce, much due to its location, right in the middle of Skåne. The name &quot;Hörby&quot; comes from the old word &quot;horg&quot; which today would translate into &quot;barrow&quot; or &quot;mound&quot;. As the name hints the woods surrounding Hörby are filled with old burial mounds (some dating back to the Bronze Age) and also some old cult places from the pre-Christian religion of asatru. The same word has given name to the neighbouring village of Höör.

==Culture==
Hörby Municipality still has much of the old cultural heritage remaining in the villages.

Hörby is famous for being home to one of the transmitting stations specified on old MF radio receivers. The broadcasting signals (radio, TV) are still transmitted from the Teracom transmitting station in Östra Sallerup, 7 km south of the town of Hörby. MF transmissions do not occur from Hörby any more, but from the new transmitter in Sölvesborg, inaugurated in 1985, at the coast of the Baltic Sea.

On the first Wednesday and Thursday in July every year since 1748, the Hörby Market (&quot;Hörby Marknad&quot;) is held. It attracts thousands of visitors and is one of the three main traditional markets in Skåne together with the markets of Kivik and Sjöbo.

The most famous personality from Hörby was the author Victoria Benedictsson (1850-1888).

Håkan Dahlby was born in Västerstad, in Hörby municipality.

<doc id="130781" wikidata="Q6178257" url="?curid=130781" title="Burns, Oregon">
<text>Burns is a city in and the county seat of Harney County, in the U.S. state of Oregon. According to the 2020 census, the population was 2,730. Burns and the nearby city of Hines are home to about 60 percent of the people in the sparsely populated county, by area the largest in Oregon and the ninth largest in the United States.

The Burns–Hines region has a high-desert climate but was much wetter in the recent geologic past. The Harney Basin was the largest of many depressions in which lakes formed in southeastern Oregon during the late Pleistocene. Remnants of an ancient lake that reached as far north as Burns are at the center of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, south of the city.

Northern Paiutes or their ancestors, who were hunter-gatherers, have lived in the region for thousands of years. Since the arrival of Euro-Americans in the 19th century, cattle ranching and other forms of agriculture have dominated land use in the area. In 1930, logging in the mountains north of Burns led to the creation of Hines, a lumber company town, and the timber industry remained important to the local economy until the 1990s. In addition to ranching, a variety of private and public enterprises support the Burns–Hines economy in the 21st century. Annual events include a migratory bird festival, the county fair, and a country music jamboree.

==History==

===Tribal===
Archeologists have found evidence of human habitation in the general vicinity of Burns that pushed the possibility of human habitation from the previous estimate of 10,000 to 18,000 years ago. 
Members of the contemporary Burns Paiute Tribe of Harney County, descended mainly from the Wadatika band of Paiutes, were hunter-gatherers throughout central and southern Oregon. The Wadatikas were named after the wada seeds collected as food from near Malheur Lake. Their territory covered about from the Cascade Range to near Boise and from the southern Blue Mountains to south of Steens Mountain. Scattered in the 19th century by clashes with white settlers and soldiers and through forced removal to distant reservations, some of the Paiutes eventually returned to Harney County.

In the 1930s, the Burns Paiute Tribe began buying land near Burns and holding tribal elections. By the late 1960s, the tribe had adopted a constitution and tribal bylaws, and in 1972 the Burns Paiute formally became an independent tribe, eligible to enter into contracts with other governments and legal entities. The tribe owns the Burns Paiute Reservation, north of Burns, and individual members of the tribe own more than of land elsewhere in the county. In 1991, the tribe had about 350 members, and about 200 lived on the reservation.

===Cities and ranches===
After the arrival of Euro-American settlers in the 19th century, Burns was established in the 1880s. It was formally incorporated after Harney County&#x27;s creation in 1889 through the splitting of Grant County into two counties. Early settler, merchant, and county commissioner George McGowan named the city after the Scottish poet Robert Burns. By 1891, the community had stores, a post office, hotels, and other businesses. McGowan was the town&#x27;s first postmaster.

In the 1920s, timber cutting and milling brought many newcomers to the region. In 1928, the Edward Hines Lumber Company acquired from the U.S. Forest Service the rights to cut timber in the Blue Mountains near Seneca, north of Burns. After winning the timber contract, the Hines Company built the Oregon and Northwestern Railroad between Burns and Seneca. Edward Hines, the company owner, built a lumber mill and company town, incorporated as the City of Hines in 1930. Timber and logging remained important to the local economy until the 1990s, when the area&#x27;s last lumber mill closed for lack of timber.

Cattle ranching in the region began as early as the 1860s and expanded after passage of the Desert Land Act of 1877. The act promoted development of arid and semi-arid public land in the western United States by making plots available to individuals willing to &quot;reclaim, irrigate, and cultivate&quot; the land. Some of the Harney County ranches established in the 19th century still exist in the 21st. Agricultural revenue for Harney County in 2011 totaled about $84 million. Of this, about 65 percent came from cattle sales, 29 percent from the sale of alfalfa hay, and most of the rest from other crops and the sale of horses.

==Geography==
Harney County is the largest county in Oregon and the tenth largest in the United States. It covers about but has a total population of only about 7,600. Most of that population lives in Burns or Hines, about southwest of Burns. Burns had about 2,800 residents in 2010 and Hines about 1,600, for a total of 4,400, nearly 60 percent of the county population.

 The city is east of Bend, and west of Ontario, Oregon, on U.S. Route 20 at its intersection with U.S. Route 395. Burns is about south of Pendleton. Oregon Route 78 runs between Burns and communities to the southeast including Crane, Princeton, and Burns Junction, about away. A fourth highway, Oregon Route 205, links the city to the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, to the south, and to Frenchglen, further south near Steens Mountain.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

===Geology===
Burns is in southeastern Oregon near the northern edge of the arid Harney Basin. The basin is part of the High Lava Plains, a region dominated by erupting volcanoes in the late Miocene, five to ten million years ago. Centered on the Brothers Fault Zone, which runs southeast–northwest between Steens Mountain and Bend, the High Lava Plains merge with the Blue Mountains to the north and the Basin and Range Province to the south.

Shallow basins formed by crustal stretching in the Basin and Range province were much wetter during the late Pleistocene, up to 11,000 years ago, than they are in the 21st century. Lakes formed in these basins, including those in the southern part of the High Lava Plains. Among these, the largest depression was the Harney Basin, covering . Within the Harney Basin, ancient Malheur Lake—the 21st-century remnants of which include Malheur Lake, Harney Lake, and Mud Lake—covered and extended as far north as Burns. These remnant wetlands have become the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.

===Climate===
Burns has a semi-arid continental climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) bordering upon a continental Mediterranean climate (&quot;Dsb&quot;) that averages 99 days with precipitation each year. Cloud cover varies from an average of 25 percent in July to 76 percent in January. Normal annual precipitation amounts to about , including of snow. The average relative humidity, measured at 4 p.m. daily, is 42 percent, varying from 21 percent in July to 68 percent in December and January. The normal monthly daily average temperature ranges from about in December to in July. On average, highs reach on 24 days annually and stay at or below the freezing mark on 31 days, while lows fall to or below on an average of 11 nights. The average first and last occurrences of freezing temperatures are September 2 and June 21, respectively, allowing a growing season of 72 days.

In January 1950, during a series of snowstorms the National Weather Service has identified as one of Oregon&#x27;s top 10 weather events of the 20th century, about of snow fell on Burns. During another top-10 event, which occurred in February 1933, the temperature at Seneca reached , the lowest ever recorded in Oregon. By highway, Seneca is about north of Burns in the Blue Mountains. At Burns itself, record temperatures since 1939 range from on December 8, 2013, up to on July 12, 2002; the record low maximum is on January 6, 1982, and December 21, 1990, while the record high minimum is on July 27 and 30, 1939.

<text>Höör Municipality (&quot;Höörs kommun&quot;) is a municipality in the central part of Skåne County in southern Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Höör.

The present municipality was formed in 1969 through the merger of &quot;old&quot; Höör with the municipalities of Norra Frosta, Snogeröd and Tjörnarp parish from the dissolved Sösdala Municipality.

== Geography ==

Höör Municipality credits itself by being different from the rest of Scania: Apart from agricultural areas, Höör Municipality also has several forests and the lake Ringsjön. Ringsjön is the second largest lake in Skåne County and covers some 40 km2, about three times the size of the town of Höör.

The two main attractions of the municipality that draw visitors are the zoological garden Skånes Djurpark, and the &quot;Bosjökloster Castle&quot; established in the 12th century. The castle is situated in a scenic location in a cape in the lake Ringsjön; the zoological garden is situated just north of the town of Höör.

Sights in the town proper are few in the little town with its 7,000 inhabitants, but it has a large 12th-century church, with a north transept from 1769 (an unusual date for Skåne churches) and a 19th-century tower, along with some picturesque older houses. A peaceful place, the typical Höör house is one or two storeys tall, with no large streets. Adding to the picturesque image are two centrally located small ponds with densely foliaged trees and bushes surrounding them, which increases in thickness until they unite with the forests surrounding the town.

=== Localities ===
There are six localities in the municipality.
Population as of December 31, 2005.

A small part of Löberöd is also within Höör Municipality.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Höör Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 16,929 residents, including 12,804 Swedish citizens of voting age. 39.8% voted for the left coalition and 58.5% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

== Parish churches ==
From January 1, 2006, Höör Municipality contains two parishes, Höör parish, incorporating the old parishes Hallaröd, Höör, Norra Rörum, and Munkarp, and parts of Ringsjö parish (the old parishes Bosjökloster and Gudmuntorp). Ringsjö parish also includes the old Hurva parish, which is in Eslöv Municipality. There are thus six former parish churches:
* Bosjökloster (12th century Romanesque, former abbey church, by Bosjökloster Castle)
* Gudmuntorp (1860, replacing 12th-century church)
* Hallaröd (late 12th century Romanesque, extended in the 19th century, late Gothic chalk paintings)
* Höör (late 12th century Romanesque, 19th-century tower, important Romanesque baptismal font)
* Norra Rörum (ca 1200, Romanesque, separate 18th century steeple, large burial chapel from the 1770s)
* Munkarp (1884, but contains baptismal font and pulpit from older church)

==International relations==
===Twin towns — Sister cities===
The municipality is twinned with:

* Stevns Municipality in Denmark 
* Soini in Finland 
* Città di Castello in Italy

<text>Cascade Locks is a city in Hood River County, Oregon, United States. The city got its name from a set of locks built to improve navigation past the Cascades Rapids of the Columbia River. The U.S. federal government approved the plan for the locks in 1875, construction began in 1878, and the locks were completed on November 5, 1896. The locks were subsequently submerged in 1938, replaced by Bonneville Lock and Dam, although the city did not lose land from the expansion of Lake Bonneville behind the dam some downstream of the city. The city population was 1,144 at the 2010 census.

Cascade Locks is just upstream from the Bridge of the Gods, a toll bridge that spans the Columbia River. It is the only bridge across the Columbia between Portland and Hood River.

Since 2008, city officials have been pursuing an arrangement that would allow them to trade city well water for state-owned spring water and to sell it to Nestlé for bottling. In May 2016, Hood River County voters voted over 68% in favor to stop the project permanently.

<text>Lomma Municipality () is a municipality in Skåne County in southern Sweden, about 10 km north of Malmö. Its seat is located in Lomma with secondary locality Bjärred being of almost equal population size.

The present municipality was created through the amalgamation of the market town &quot;Lomma&quot; and the rural municipality &quot;Flädie&quot;. It took place in 1963, between the two nationwide local government reforms of 1952 and 1971.

==Geography==

The small municipality borders to Kävlinge Municipality, Burlöv Municipality, Staffanstorp Municipality and Lund Municipality. As Burlöv also is notably small, Lomma Municipality almost borders to Malmö Municipality too.

It is situated by Öresund, at the inlet of the small river Höje å. Along the river lies a yacht marina. In the old industrial area along the river new appartements and villas are erected, with some facing the river or the beach. The beaches along its coasts also attract visitors from other municipalities; Lomma Municipality&#x27;s beaches are the principal beaches for people from the beach-less Lund.

 to the north-east is the university city of Lund, with some 80,000 inhabitants, about the same distance as to Malmö (with its 285,000 inhabitants) to the south. Lomma Municipality is also considered part of Metropolitan Malmö, showing itself for instance by the 6,500 commuters that live in there. Travelling to and from Lomma Municipality is easy, as a main highway actually passes straight through the town of Lomma, connecting with Lund and Malmö, and with other cities to the north.

Geologically, its terrain is almost completely flat levelled, which is the custom for south-western Skåne as a whole. The highest location in Lomma Municipality is above sea level.

===Localities===
There were three localities in the municipality as of 2018.

Of note is also Alnarp, where one of the main campuses of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences is located.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Lomma Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 24,615 residents, including 17,944 Swedish citizens of voting age. 38.4% voted for the left coalition and 60.8% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==History==
The area where Lomma Municipality is now is located between two small rivers, and was inhabited by hunters in the Stone Age. The name &quot;Lomma&quot; can be traced to 1085, and in the ensuing centuries it established some wealth thanks to merchancy with the episcopal see in Lund.
Nonetheless, the area was only a village until Sweden&#x27;s first cement works was established in 1871. The ground consists of a certain clay stemming from the last ice age, and is available in large quantities in Lomma Municipality. A fully fledged industry was started in the 1860s, and by the end of the century Lomma Municipality had five brick factories. The bricks from Lomma are yellow of appearance and were regarded as the highest kind of bricks during that century. One church built with those bricks is the church in Lomma, (&quot;Lomma kyrka&quot;), a large neo Gothic church that was finished in the 1870s.

The coat of arms depicts an anchor - showing the importance of the harbour - and a brick wall, indicating that Lomma Municipality once actually had city rights as well as its brick industry.

<text>Hood River is a city and the seat of Hood River County, Oregon, United States. It is a port on the Columbia River, and is named for the nearby Hood River. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 8,313. It is the only city in Oregon where public consumption of alcohol on sidewalks or parks is completely unrestricted.

== History ==

Hood River (originally called Dog River) post office was established (named by Mary Coe, who founded the city with her husband Nathaniel Coe) at the site of the present city on September 30, 1868,
and the city itself was incorporated in 1895. Originally, the city was part of Wasco County, but it became the seat of Hood River County when the county was first established in 1908.

===Hood River Incident===
The Hood River incident involved the removal of 16 Nisei servicemen&#x27;s names from the county &quot;roll of honor&quot; in Hood River, Oregon, by the local American Legion Post 22. The incident, on November 29, 1944, was part of a string of anti-Japanese actions taken in an attempt to prevent removed Japanese Americans from returning to the area after their release from internment by the United States federal government. National outrage against the community heightened five weeks later when a local Japanese American serviceman died after completing a heroic mission in the Philippines. Under great pressure, the local American Legion post restored Nisei names to the wall of the county courthouse on April 29, 1945.

== Economy ==

Hood River&#x27;s economy has traditionally been based on three industries: agriculture, tourism, and sports recreation, but since the late 1990s, high-tech industries, such as aerospace engineering (e.g. Insitu and Hood Technologies), have become some of the largest employers. Long an agricultural center of the Pacific Northwest, Hood River historically was a hub of logging exports and fruit tree orchards. While lumber was the primary export for Hood River throughout most of its history, with the advent of forest protection measures such as the establishment of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, Hood River has exchanged most of its former tree cutting agricultural ways to focus more heavily on its apple and pear orchards as well as many wineries. Many of these local orchards and wineries, including Hood River-based The Fruit Company, are featured on Hood River&#x27;s renowned &quot;Fruit Loop&quot;.

Hood River first experienced a boom in tourism after being discovered as a site for windsurfing, and more recently kiteboarding. Hood River County also has some of the best kayaking, mountain biking, downhill and Nordic skiing, and hiking areas in the United States.

Situated in the Columbia Gorge, and surrounded by fields, orchards, vineyards, and at the foot of Mount Hood, Hood River is a popular tourist destination.

All of these factors have led to coverage and acclaim in publications such as &quot;National Geographic Adventure&quot;, &quot;Sunset&quot;, &quot;Outside&quot;, &quot;Backpacker&quot;, &quot;Smithsonian&quot;, the &quot;New York Times&quot; travel section, and others. Hood River has received numerous awards from national magazines, such as &quot;coolest small town&quot; to &quot;fifth best ski-town in America&quot;. Most recently, Hood River was featured on CNN as one of &quot;11 great riverfront towns&quot; in the United States.

Other industries in the city include Hood River Distillers, Full Sail Brewing Company, and vegetarian food manufacturer Turtle Island Foods, producer of Tofurky. The Hood River Valley is also home to more than a dozen wineries.

==Arts and culture==

Situated against a backdrop of the spectacular Cascade Mountains and the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, Hood River has become home to a notable concentration of visual and performing artists, writers, design professionals, business creatives, and culinary establishments. In 2018, Hood River was listed as the number four small city in the &quot;Arts Vibrancy Index&quot;, released by the National Center for Arts Research at Southern Methodist University.

Among the arts organizations in the city is the Performing Arts Initiative, a non-profit group founded in 2016 with the goal of building a performing arts center in the Columbia River Gorge. The group&#x27;s chair, Mark Steighner, was the musical director of Hood River Valley High School before retiring to head the PAI.

Also based in Hood River is the Columbia Gorge Orchestra Association (CGOA), a non-profit organization that includes six ensembles. The CGOA initially consisted solely of the Mid-Columbia Sinfonietta, which began performing in 1977 in conjunction with the Chamber Music Society of Oregon. The association was formed in 2004, adding two choirs, a jazz collective, a string quartet, and a theater group throughout the next ten years.

A small city with good walkability, Hood River is home to a public art walking tour and six diverse art galleries all within the small &#x27;downtown&#x27; area. &quot;BIG ART ,&quot; the public art walking tour hosted by Art of Community (established in 2014), periodically rotates sculptures and other outdoor art installations throughout the town.

===Annual events===
Annual cultural events in the Hood River Valley include Hood River Valley Blossom Time and the Hood River Hard-Pressed Cider Fest, which take place in April, as well as the Hood River Hops Fest and the Hood River Valley Harvest Fest, both in October. In 2012, FoodandWine.com identified the Harvest Fest as one of the best harvest festivals in the United States.

The oldest swimming event on the Columbia River, the Roy Webster Cross-Channel Swim, takes place in Hood River every Labor Day. The event has been held nearly continuously since 1942, with the first cancellation occurring in 2017 due to the Eagle Creek Fire. The U.S. Windsurfing National Championships were held in Hood River in 2001, 2009, and 2012, and the Mount Hood Cycling Classic was held in the city from 2002 to 2013.

===Museums and other points of interest===

Hood River is home to the History Museum of Hood River County and the Western Antique Aeroplane &amp; Automobile Museum; the International Museum of Carousel Art was also housed in the city until its closure in 2010. The city has over two dozen sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places (due in large part to the work of Sally Donovan, a local historian), including the Columbia Gorge Hotel, built in 1920 by Portland timber baron and Columbia Gorge booster Simon Benson.

The oldest house in the city is the Ezra L. Smith home, which he built in 1886 for his family. Smith was influential in state politics, in Oregon agricultural development, in Hood River city administration, and in banking. The house later served as a mortuary for over 40 years and is now the site of wine production and tastings for Stoltz Vineyards.

==Parks and recreation==
Hood River is the western gateway to the Mount Hood Scenic Byway and to a major section of the Historic Columbia River Highway. Hood River is considered a &quot;sports mecca&quot; and offers some of the best spots for windsurfing, kitesurfing, kayaking, standup paddleboarding, skiing and mountain biking—all for which it draws considerable national attention from many media outlets, such as the New York Times and &quot;National Geographic Adventure&quot;. The Port Commission has built a protected harbor for learning windsurfing called &quot;The Hook&quot;. The city also features the family- and wind-sport–friendly Waterfront Park, a public pool, a skate park, biking trails, and several small public parks and ball fields. The valley is also home to two 18-hole golf courses. Further, the nation&#x27;s oldest volunteer search and rescue crew serving a mountain area, the Crag Rats, has its base in Hood River.

==Education==

Public primary and secondary schools in Hood River are part of the Hood River County School District. Representing the change in town culture is the new garden, greenhouse and zero-energy music and science building at Hood River Middle School as part of the new Outdoor Classroom Project.
The city is also served by an extension campus of Columbia Gorge Community College, based in The Dalles. Horizon Christian School is a private school serving grades kindergarten through twelfth grade (K–12). Horizon competes at the 1A level of the Oregon School Activities Association, while the public Hood River Valley High School competes at the 5A level. The city also is home to the Mid-Columbia Adventist School.

In 2017, theatre educator Rachel Harry received the Excellence in Theatre Education Award, presented at the 71st Tony Awards ceremony. She was an honorable mention for this award the year prior. The award recognizes the integrity and excellence of the theatre program Harry has built since 1986 at the Hood River Valley High School and of her wider work throughout the community.

<doc id="130795" wikidata="Q504601" url="?curid=130795" title="Sjöbo Municipality">
<text>Sjöbo Municipality (&quot;Sjöbo kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Skåne County in southern Sweden. Its seat is located in the town Sjöbo.

The present municipality was created in 1974 when the former market town (&quot;köping&quot;) &quot;Sjöbo&quot; was amalgamated with the surrounding rural municipalities. There are fifteen original entities within today&#x27;s municipality.

==Geography==
The town of Sjöbo has flat terrain, with many small houses and three long straight streets stretching through it, leading to larger roads.

The northwestern part of the municipality includes the main part of Vombsjön, the largest lake of southern Scania and notable for being the water source of Malmö. Some parts of the lake belong to Lund Municipality. It offers fishing for European perch, pike, pikeperch and eel.

===Localities===
There are 9 urban areas (also called a Tätort or locality) in Sjöbo Municipality.

In the table they are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2005. The municipal seat is in bold characters.



==Activities==
There are at least five (largely) authentic medieval churches from the 12th century in the municipality (in Södra Åsum, Tolånga, Björka, Blentarp and Everlöv). They are notable for not having undergone the severe restorations that many other churches in Scania suffered once the population began growing in the second half of the 19th century and Helgo Zetterwall was hired to expand on them.

Frescos which adorned the apse of Södra Åsum church and the ceilings of the churches in Everlöv and Illstrop centuries ago have been slowly uncovered in recent years. Many similar churches had their ornamentation stripped and their paintings plastered over as part of the iconoclasm of Sweden&#x27;s adoption of Lutheranism.

Apart from religious activities, there is the annual festival &quot;Sjöbo marknad&quot;, which translates to English as &quot;Sjöbo fair.&quot; It was first held in 1864, and is now held in late July, attracting some 100,000 visitors, making it one of the largest country fairs in Sweden. It has carousels and is otherwise noted for its pottery vendors and trade.

==Refugee controversy==

Sjöbo Municipality reached the public eye in Sweden in 1988 when, under the leadership of the Municipal Commissioner Sven-Olle Olsson, it voted by a majority of 67% in a referendum that it would not accept foreign asylum seekers. Most other municipalities in Sweden accepted refugees that came from troubled countries such as former Yugoslavia and Iraq.

This is a demographic table based on Sjöbo Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 19,473 inhabitants, including 14,943 Swedish citizens of voting age. 28.8% voted for the left coalition and 70.1% for the right coalition. With 42.6 % of the vote, Sjöbo saw the highest result in the entire country for the Sweden Democrats. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Elections==
These are the results of elections held since the 1972 municipal reform. In 2014 Sjöbo Municipality became the first municipality in Sweden where the Sweden Democrats held the largest share of the votes. The high number of &quot;missing&quot; votes from the list from 1991 belonged to the Sjöbo Party. The Sweden Democrats numbers in 1988-1998 were not listed at a municipal level by the SCB due to the party&#x27;s small size domestically.

===Riksdag===
Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party.

<text>Central Point is a city in Jackson County, Oregon, United States. The population was 18,997 as of 2020. The city shares its southern border with Medford and is a part of the Medford metropolitan area. Central Point is home of the Jackson County Fair that occurs in July.

==History==
Isaac Constant, a pioneer who settled here in 1852, named the location &quot;Central Point&quot; because of its location at a crossroads in the middle of the Rogue Valley. At this point, the main north–south road from the Willamette Valley met the road between Jacksonville and settlements along the Rogue River.

<text>Svedala Municipality (&quot;Svedala kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Skåne County in southern Sweden, just southeast of Malmö. Its seat is located in the town of Svedala.

The present municipality is the result of a series of amalgamations, carried out in 1952, 1967, 1974 and 1977. Svedala was last municipality to be completed during the local government reform of the 1970s. There had been considerations of adding the whole or parts of the territory to Malmö Municipality.

There exists a city partnership between Svedala Municipality and Bergen auf Rügen, Germany.

==Localities==
There are 5 urban areas (also called a Tätort or locality) in Svedala Municipality.

==Elections==

The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party. &quot;Elected&quot; is the total number of percentage points from the municipality that went to parties who were elected to the Riksdag.

<text>Eagle Point is a city in Jackson County, Oregon, United States. The population was 8,469 at the 2010 census, up from 4,798 at the 2000 census. As of 2018, the estimated population was 9,408.

==History==
In the mid-19th century, a rocky cliff near the location of what later became Eagle Point was a favored nesting place for eagles. An area resident, John Mathews, is said to have suggested &quot;Eagle Point&quot; as the name for a proposed post office in the community. The post office was established in 1872; Andrew McNeil was the first postmaster.

A water-powered gristmill, Butte Creek Mill, has operated in Eagle Point for more than 125 years. Built in 1872 along Little Butte Creek, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The mill burned to the ground Christmas Day 2015. The Butte Creek Mill has been rebuilt, with its first batch of grain sold in December 2020. On May 15, 2016, Actor Jim Belushi performed at an outdoor benefit concert for the Butte Creek Mill. In 2018, Actor Patrick Duffy, a longtime Eagle Point resident signed-on as the Advisory Director for the Butte Creek Mill Foundation in an effort to rebuild the Butte Creek Mill. He joins actor Jim Belushi who has been a supporter of the mill since the fire.
In 2018, Eagle Point Police Officer Daniel Cardenas shot and killed Matthew Graves. According to attorneys Kelly L. Anderson and David Linthorst, the “arrest” of Graves on mere suspicion alone is not grounds to detain him. “After making an unlawful arrest,” attorneys said, “Cardenas compounded the problem by using excessive force. In doing so, Cardenas himself created the very crisis for which he later claimed to have needed to use deadly force.”. Cardenas also made multiple discrepancies during his Grand Jury testimony which went against his protest of innocence. The City had to pay 4.5 Million Dollars for wrongful death.

<text>Ängelholm Municipality (&quot;Ängelholms kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Scania County in South Sweden in southern Sweden. Its seat is located in the city Ängelholm.

In 1971 the &quot;City of Ängelholm&quot; was amalgamated with the rural municipalities &quot;Ausås&quot;, &quot;Barkåkra&quot;, &quot;Hjärnarp&quot; and &quot;Munka-Ljungby&quot;, thus creating a municipality of unitary type.

<text>Östra Göinge Municipality (&quot;Östra Göinge kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Scania County in southern Sweden. Its seat is located in Broby.

The present municipality was formed in 1974 when the former municipalities of &quot;Broby&quot;, &quot;Glimåkra&quot;, &quot;Hjärsås&quot; and &quot;Knislinge&quot; were amalgamated.

There are 8 smaller population centers (urban areas) in the municipality, where approximately 80 percent of the population lives, surrounded by sparsely populated rural areas.

==Geography==
Östra Göinge Municipality is part of , a region in northern Scania which borders the provinces of Småland and Blekinge. It is a densely forested area with deciduous and coniferous trees, interspersed with open agricultural land. The river Helgeån runs through the municipality.

===Localities===
There are 8 urban areas (also called a Tätort or locality) in Östra Göinge Municipality. In the table they are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2005. The municipal seat is in bold characters.

==History==
The Snapphane, Scanian resistance fighters of 17th century, took refuge in the forests of Östra Göinge. Considered rebels and bandits by the Swedish army, the Snapphanar were protected by the local population and their bravery is still cherished in the municipality. All of Göingebygden endured hardship and suffered devastation during the times after the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, during Scania&#x27;s transition from being a Danish to becoming a Swedish ruled territory.

The dialect of Göingebygden has historically been distinguishable from the southern Scanian dialects as well as the northern Småland dialects, perhaps because the population took pride in the area&#x27;s historical autonomy and resilient resistance.

The coat of arms for Östra Göinge depicts two palm branches crossing each other, a traditional symbol of peace and unity designed for and given to the area after it became Swedish. The lower part of the coat of arms depicts hammers, and was added when the municipality was joined with an adjacent municipality in 1976.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Östra Göinge Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 14,920 residents, including 10,574 Swedish citizens of voting age. 35.1% voted for the left coalition and 63.8% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Elections==
Below are the results listed from since the 1973 municipal reform. Between 1988 and 1998 the Sweden Democrats&#x27; results were not published by the SCB due to the party&#x27;s small size nationwide. &quot;Turnout&quot; denotes the percentage of the electorate casting a ballot, but &quot;Votes&quot; only applies to valid ballots cast.

===Riksdag===
Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party. &quot;Elected&quot; is the total number of percentage points from the municipality that went to parties who were elected to the Riksdag.

==Industry==
A famous, very fine-grained black diabase is mined in Östra Göinge. Because of the extremely high quality of the diabase from this area, it is in high demand worldwide and has become popular with artists all over the globe, one of the more well-known being Takashi Naraha from Japan. It is primarily used for gravestones, monuments, sculptures, and other forms of stone artworks, but also to decorate buildings. The Empire State Building is partly covered with diabase from the area and the US Marine Corps War Memorial has a foundation of diabase from Göingebygden.

Scania AB and Tarkett have a presence in Östra Göinge.

<doc id="130811" wikidata="Q706834" url="?curid=130811" title="Taiwan Solidarity Union">
<text>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) is a political party in Taiwan which advocates Taiwan independence, and is affiliated with the Taiwanese localization movement. It was officially founded on 12 August 2001 and is considered part of the Pan-Green Coalition. Unlike the Democratic Progressive Party, its larger companion party in the Pan-Green Coalition, the TSU actively campaigns for the creation of a &quot;de jure&quot; Republic of Taiwan.

==History==

In the summer of 2001, supporters of former President Lee Teng-hui formed the Taiwan Solidarity Union. In the 2000 presidential elections, the Kuomintang (KMT) suffered a devastating defeat, in which internal turmoil had caused the party to lose its grip on power. This was blamed on Lee, the KMT Chairman at the time, and he was forced to resign in March 2001. The hardliners in the KMT, as well as the supporters of James Soong recently expelled from the KMT, believed Lee secretly harbored support for Taiwan independence and had purposely sabotaged the KMT (by not allowing Soong to run under the KMT) in order to allow Chen Shui-bian, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate, to win. Meanwhile, after winning the presidential election, Chen Shui-bian moderated his pro-independence position, alienating some hardline independence supporters in the DPP. By July, just months before the December 2001 elections to the Legislative Yuan, these factors accumulated to result in the formation of the TSU to continue Lee&#x27;s policies, and fill the void in Taiwanese politics caused by the DPP&#x27;s abandonment of its strongly pro-independence political stance. It was hoped that this would lead to a pan-green majority in the nation&#x27;s primary legislative body, thus giving the executive branch, under Chen, the political backing necessary to pursue policies supportive of Taiwanese independence.

The party name and emblem were announced on 25 July 2001, and was officially founded on 12 August.

The TSU&#x27;s stated political aim is the advocacy of the creation of a Republic of Taiwan and a policy of desinicization which consists of eliminating the symbols and concepts which connect Taiwan to the idea of China. The TSU argues that any lingering connection with the concept of China renders Taiwan an &quot;abnormal nation&quot; and that clearly separating Taiwan from China is necessary to prevent Taiwan from being dominated by an enemy and foreign nation. The TSU has also strongly advocated the creation of a new constitution for Taiwan and the abandonment of &quot;Republic of China&quot; as Taiwan&#x27;s formal name.

Lee was, naturally, identified as the &quot;spiritual leader&quot; (though he personally never joined the party); the TSU hoped that Lee&#x27;s popularity would help the TSU make the 5% support mark. Further, Lee&#x27;s dominance in the party was revealed when the candidates TSU nominated had all been personally approved by Lee beforehand. Meanwhile, as Lee&#x27;s actions increasingly departed from the KMT&#x27;s unificationist positions, he was eventually expelled from the Kuomintang. Although there was some initial speculation that Lee&#x27;s expulsion would cause mass defections in the Kuomintang, none of the major Kuomintang leaders or Lee&#x27;s close associates changed sides. Nonetheless, former members of the KMT were still to be the fundamental building blocks of the new party, with half of TSU candidates coming directly from the KMT.

After winning nine seats in the 225-member Legislative Yuan in December 2001, the TSU has largely displaced the Taiwan Independence Party (TAIP) as the strongly pro-Taiwan-independence political force and the TSU legislators began advocating relevant resolutions. For instance, they have opened the debates about changing the national flag and national anthem. In the 2002 Taiwanese municipal elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung, TSU fielded no mayoral candidate, and it suffered a defeat in winning no seats in the Taipei City council and won only two seats in the Kaohsiung City council.

==Yasukuni Shrine visit==

The visit to the Yasukuni Shrine by TSU chairman Shu Chin-chiang in April 2005 generated a controversy across the political spectrum and further made their party goals more ambiguous to the voters. However, the TSU has made it clear that it would achieve its goal of total independence by all means. Chairman Shu denied the visit should be seen as support for militarism, and claimed it was a goodwill gesture to Taiwan&#x27;s former colonial master Japan to further strengthen the security of the Pacific region. Chairman Su also emphasized that there is a need to remind the Taiwanese public that the People&#x27;s Republic of China is aiming 700 missiles towards Taiwan and that Japan would be an important ally if China were inclined to invade.

Chairman Shu&#x27;s visit, however, gave opportunity to aboriginal legislator Kao Chin Su-mei to gain publicity by protesting with her supporters at the chairman&#x27;s arrival at the Chiang Kai-Shek International Airport, now renamed Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. Later on the TSU press conference was disrupted by an angry mob from the members of pro-unification Patriot Association (愛國同心會), who showed their disagreement and dissatisfaction by throwing eggs at the conference building. The DPP, the ruling party, kept a low profile in this controversy and attempts to distance itself from the incident.

==Current status==

The TSU suffered defeat in the December 2005 local elections, along with its pan-green partner the DPP, and failed to win any municipal mayoral or county magistrate seats. Its representation in the Legislative Yuan was eliminated by the 2008 election when it failed to win any district-contested seats and failed to gain the 5% threshold for proportional representation.

In the 2012 legislative elections, the TSU won 8.98% of the popular vote and earned three representatives to the Legislative Yuan, renewing its status as a credible third party in Taiwanese government. The 2016 legislative elections saw the TSU win 2.51% of all votes, not enough for representation. The latest loss lead to the resignation of party chairman Huang Kun-huei. Shortly after, all of the party&#x27;s workforce was laid off.

<text>The Taiwan Independence Party (TAIP; ), also known as the Taiwan Nation Party, was a political party from 1996 to 2020 in Taiwan. It was usually associated with the Pan-Green Coalition and supported Taiwan independence.

== History ==
Disappointed by the Democratic Progressive Party&#x27;s (DPP) gradual moderation of its support of Taiwan independence, some DPP members, many connected to Peng Ming-min&#x27;s &quot;Nation Building Association&quot;, formed the Taiwan Independence Party in 1996. However, the party has failed to win large-scale support, due to the lack of organizational skills and internal disagreements. It was largely displaced as Taiwan&#x27;s ideological independence party by the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU). The Ministry of Interior removed its entry from the registry of parties on 29 April 2020.

<text>Jacksonville is a city in Jackson County, Oregon, United States, approximately west of Medford. It was named for Jackson Creek, which flows through the community and was the site of one of the first placer gold claims in the area. It includes Jacksonville Historic District, which was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1966. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 2,785, up from 2,235 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Jacksonville was founded following discovery of gold deposits in 1851–1852. The first hanging in Southern Oregon took place in Jacksonville in the spring of 1852. With the creation of Jackson County, it became the county seat, a role which was transferred to nearby Medford in 1927.

Jacksonville was home to the first Chinatown in Oregon, founded by immigrants from San Francisco. Physical evidence of this chapter of history was uncovered early in March 2004 when road work uncovered artifacts dating to the 1850s and 1860s. Construction was halted while archeologists performed four days of rescue excavations. Their findings included broken Chinese bowls and tea cups, handmade bottles, and fragments of opium paraphernalia and Chinese coins.
As the gold deposits were worked out in the 1860s and the railway bypassed Jacksonville in 1884, the city&#x27;s economy slowed. This had the unintended benefit of preserving a number of structures, which led to Jacksonville&#x27;s being designated a National Historic District in 1966, covering over 100 buildings. It was cited as a &quot;mid-19th century inland commercial city significant for its magnificent group of surviving unaltered commercial and residential buildings. The city was the principal financial center of southern Oregon until it was bypassed by the Oregon and California Railroad.&quot;

<text>Medford is a city in and the county seat of Jackson County, Oregon, in the United States. As of the 2020 United States Census on April 1, 2020, the city had a total population of 85,824, making it the eighth-most populous city in Oregon, and a metropolitan area population of 223,259, making the Medford MSA the fourth largest metro area in Oregon. The city was named in 1883 by David Loring, civil engineer and right-of-way agent for the Oregon and California Railroad, after Medford, Massachusetts, which was near Loring&#x27;s hometown of Concord, Massachusetts. Medford is near the middle fork of Bear Creek.

==History==

In 1883, a group of railroad surveyors headed by S.L. Dolson and David Loring arrived in Rock Point, near present-day Gold Hill. They were charged with finding the best route through the Rogue Valley for the Oregon and California Railroad. Citizens of neighboring Jacksonville hoped that it would pass between their town and &quot;Hanley Butte&quot;, near the present day Claire Hanley Arboretum. Such a move would have all but guaranteed prosperous growth for Jacksonville, but Dolson decided instead to stake the railroad closer to Bear Creek. The response from Jacksonville was mixed, but the decision was final. By November 1883, a depot site had been chosen and a surveying team led by Charles J. Howard was hard at work platting the new town. They completed their work in early December 1883, laying out 82 blocks for development.

James Sullivan Howard, a merchant and surveyor, claimed to have built the town&#x27;s first building in January 1884, though blacksmith Emil Piel was advertising for business at the &quot;central depot&quot; in the middle of December 1883.
Others point out the farms of town founders Iradell Judson Phipps and Charles Wesley Broback, which were present before the town was platted. Regardless, on February 6, 1884 (less than a month after it was built), J. S. Howard&#x27;s store became Medford&#x27;s first post office, with Howard serving as postmaster. The establishment of the post office led to the incorporation of Medford as a town by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on February 24, 1885, and again as a city in 1905. Howard held the position of postmaster for Medford&#x27;s first ten years, and again held the post at the time of his death on November 13, 1919.

The beginning of the 20th century was a transitional period for the area. Medford built a new steel bridge over Bear Creek to replace an earlier one which washed away three years before. Without a bridge, those wanting to cross had to ford the stream, typically using a horse-drawn wagon; the first automobile did not arrive in Medford until 1903. Pharmacist George H. Haskins had opened a drugstore just after the town was platted, and in 1903 he allowed the Medford Library Association to open a small library in that store. Five years later the library moved to Medford&#x27;s new city hall; in another four years, Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s donation allowed a dedicated library to be built. Construction on the Medford Carnegie Library was completed in 1912.

In 1927, Medford took the title of county seat of Jackson County away from nearby Jacksonville.

Between World War II and the 1960s, Medford had a reputation as a sundown town where African Americans and other nonwhites were not allowed to live or stay at night.

In 1967, Interstate 5 was completed immediately adjacent to downtown Medford to replace the Oregon Pacific Highway. It has been blamed for the decline of small businesses in downtown Medford since its completion, but nevertheless remains an important route for commuters wishing to travel across the city. In fact, a study completed in 1999 found that 45% of vehicles entering I-5 from north Medford heading south exited in south Medford, just three miles (5 km) away.

The high volume of traffic on Interstate 5 led to the completion of a new north Medford interchange in 2006. The project, which cost about $36 million, improved traffic flow between I-5 and Crater Lake Highway. Further traffic problems identified in south Medford prompted the construction of another new interchange, costing $72 million. The project began in 2006 and was completed in 2010.

Since the 1990s, Medford has dedicated an appreciable amount of resources to urban renewal in an attempt to revitalize the downtown area. Several old buildings have been restored, including the Craterian Ginger Rogers Theater and the Prohibition era Cooley-Neff Warehouse, now operating as Pallet Wine Company, an urban winery. Streets have been realigned, new sidewalks, traffic signals, and bicycle lanes were installed, and two new parking garages have been built. Downtown Medford also received a new library building to replace the historic Medford Carnegie Library and now boasts satellite campuses for both Rogue Community College and Southern Oregon University.

Economic problems in 2008 and 2009 put a hold on &quot;The Commons&quot; project, a collaboration between the city of Medford and Lithia Motors. The project, one of the largest undertaken in downtown in recent years, aims to provide more parking, recreation, and commerce to the area. Before the work stopped, the Greyhound Bus depot was moved and $850,000 was spent replacing water lines. The Commons is anchored by the new corporate headquarters of Lithia Motors. Included in The Commons are two public park blocks slated to be informal public gathering areas as well as an area for special events such as the farmer&#x27;s market. Ground breaking for the project was April 22, 2011, with a Phase 1 completion date of 2012.

==Geography==
Medford is located approximately north of the northern border of California.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Medford is situated in the remains of ancient volcanic flow areas as demonstrated by the Upper and Lower Table Rock lava formations and nearby Mount McLoughlin and Crater Lake, which is the remains of Mount Mazama.

===Climate===

Medford sits in a rain shadow between the Cascade Range and Siskiyou Mountains called the Rogue Valley. As such, most of the rain associated with the Pacific Northwest (and Oregon in particular) skips Medford, making it drier and sunnier than the Willamette Valley. Medford&#x27;s climate is considerably warmer, both in summer and winter, than its latitude would suggest, with a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;). Summers are akin to Eastern Oregon, and winters resemble the coast. Here, summer sees an average of 61 afternoons over and 11 afternoons over . In August 1981, the high temperature reached over for four consecutive days, with two days reaching . Freezing temperatures occur on 64 mornings during an average year, and in some years there may be a day or two where the high stays at or below freezing; the average window for freezing temperatures is October 23 through April 23. The city is located in USDA hardiness zone 8. Medford also experiences temperature inversions in the winter which during its lumber mill days produced fog so thick that visibility could be reduced to less than . These inversions can last for weeks; some suggest this is because the metropolitan area has one of the lowest average wind speeds of all American metropolitan areas. The heavy fog returns nearly every winter with the inversions lowering air quality for several months without relief.

Medford residents experience snowfall during the winter that, due to the weather shadow effect, averages and melts fairly quickly. In the past, the city has seen seasonal snowfall totals reach in 1955–1956. That season was also the wettest &quot;rain year&quot; with a total of ; this immediately followed the driest &quot;rain year&quot; since records started in 1911 from July 1954 to June 1955 when only was recorded. By far the wettest month has been December 1964 with ; no other month has had more than . The wettest day on record has been December 2, 1962, with .

The lowest recorded temperature in Medford was on December 13, 1919, and the highest recorded temperature was on July 20, 1946, and June 28, 2021. There is significantly more diurnal temperature variation in summer than in winter, with the difference between December high and low average temperatures being only , whereas the difference between August high and low average temperatures is .

Medford experienced increased gang activity and organized crime in the 2000s. In 2009, Medford experienced increased methamphetamine use, which was believed to have contributed to property crimes, including identity theft.

==Economy==
Medford&#x27;s economy is driven primarily by the health care industry. The two major medical centers in the city, Asante Rogue Regional Medical Center and Providence Medford Medical Center, employ over 2,000 people. As Medford is also a retirement destination, assisted living and senior services have become an important part of the economy.

In the past, Medford&#x27;s economy was fueled by agriculture (pears, peaches, viticulture grapes) and timber products. The largest direct marketer of fruits and food gifts in the United States, Harry and David Operations Corp., is based in Medford. It is the largest employer in Southern Oregon, with 1,700 year round and about 6,700 seasonal employees in the Medford area. The recreational legalization of OR marijuana in 2012 has been a special boon for area agriculture. Of the more than two million pounds of marijuana grown in the state each year, $2 million a month is sold from Medford area retailers. Lithia Motors, a Fortune 500 company and the 4th largest auto retailer in the U.S., has been headquartered in Medford since 1970 and was started in Ashland in 1946, named for a nearby springs.

Other companies located in the city include Benchmark Maps, Falcon Northwest, Pacific International Enterprises, and Tucker Sno-Cat. Medford and the surrounding area is home to the expanding Oregon wine industry, which includes the Rogue Valley AVA.

The city&#x27;s historic downtown has undergone an economic recovery in recent years, using a combination of public funds and private investment. The revitalization effort led to the renovation of underutilized downtown properties and to the construction of a new Lithia Motors headquarters building in the district, completed in 2012.
Hospitality company The Neuman Hotel Group, based in nearby Ashland, OR, took over management and ownership of a large downtown motel, The Red Lion, in 2014, that had fallen into disrepair. Neuman Hotel Group renovated the property and renamed it Inn At the Commons.

===Bear Creek Corporation/Harry &amp; David===

Medford is the birthplace of Bear Creek Corporation, known around the world for its fruit-laden gift baskets, especially locally grown pears. Tours of the plant are open to the public.

The cemetery, established in 1890, lies on just north of Bear Creek Park. The Parks and Recreation Department offers free tours of the cemetery.

===Medford Carnegie Library===
The Medford Carnegie Library is a two-story library building located in downtown Medford. It was erected in 1911 thanks to a gift from Andrew Carnegie, but was vacated in 2004 after a new library building was constructed near the Rogue Community College extension campus, also in downtown Medford. Currently, a nonprofit, The Children&#x27;s Museum of Southern Oregon (formerly Kidtime), occupies the location.

===Vogel Plaza===

Finished in 1997 at the intersection of E. Main St and Central Ave in downtown Medford, Vogel Plaza has quickly become a center of activity for many local events.

===Alba Park===

:&quot;Location:&quot; 
The oldest park in Medford, Alba Park is located at the intersection of Holly and Main in downtown Medford was deeded to the city by the railroad company in 1888. Known as &quot;Library Park&quot; after the 1911 construction of the Medford Carnegie Library, it was later renamed for Medford&#x27;s sister city, Alba, Italy. The park contains a gazebo, a statue of a boy with two dogs surrounded by a fountain pool, and a Japanese gun from World War II.

===Bear Creek Park===

At nearly , this south Medford park is the second largest in the city (Prescott Park is the largest at 1,740 acres). Bear Creek Park is bordered on the west by Bear Creek and the Bear Creek Greenway. On the park grounds are four tennis courts, a skatepark, a dog park, an amphitheater, a large playground, a BMX track, and a community garden.

Since 1925, the property hosting Bear Creek Park has been used for several purposes. The first section was purchased from a resident of Medford named Mollie Keene. The town used it for incinerating garbage until 1939. After that, it spent 20 years as a girl scout day camp before seeing private ownership again for a few years. Concerns about pollution in the Bear Creek received media attention in 1963 and the city purchased more property. In 1988, a playground designed by Robert Leathers of New York was built.

===The Commons===
The Commons is a building in Pear Blossom Park, a public park built in the city&#x27;s historic downtown district adjacent to the Lithia Motors headquarters building. It has been used as a venue for community activities. It was completed in 2012.

===Roxy Ann Peak and Prescott Park===
One of Medford&#x27;s most prominent landmarks, Roxy Ann Peak is a 30-million-year-old mountain located on the east side of the city. Its summit is above sea level. It was named for Roxy Ann Bowen, an early settler who lived in its foothills.

A significant area of Roxy Ann Peak (including the summit) is enclosed in Medford&#x27;s largest park, a protected area called Prescott Park. The land was set aside in the 1930s and named in honor of George J. Prescott, a police officer killed in the line of duty in 1933.

==Government==
Medford has a council-manager style of government. The governing body of Medford consists of an elected mayor and eight city council members, two from each of four wards. The council hires a professional city manager to run the day-to-day operations of the city including the hiring of city staff.

The mayor and council members are not paid, but are reimbursed for expenses.

===Newspaper===
Until 2023, the principal newspaper of Medford and Jackson County was the &quot;Mail Tribune&quot;, founded in 1909. It ceased publication of its print editions in September 2022 and shut down all operations on January 13, 2023. Within days of the &quot;Mail Tribune&quot; shutting down, EO Media Grouppublisher of several other newspapers in Oregonannounced that it would be launching a new newspaper, based in Medford, to fill the void. With print editions three days a week (Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays), the first of which was published on February 18, the new paper was initially named the &quot;Rogue Valley Tribune&quot;. The owners of the former paper objected to the use of &quot;Tribune&quot; in the name, and on March 1, 2023, EO Media Group changed the newspaper&#x27;s name to the &quot;Rogue Valley Times&quot;, in order to avoid a potential legal fight. David Smigelski, a former editor at the &quot;Mail Tribune&quot;, was hired as managing editor of the &quot;Rogue Valley Times&quot;.

They were a short-season single-A minor league baseball affiliate of the Oakland Athletics who played at historic Miles Field from 1979 to 1999 before relocating to Vancouver, British Columbia.

Medford also hosted a professional indoor football team from the National Indoor Football League known as the Southern Oregon Heat in 2001. They played in the Compton Arena at the Jackson County Expo Park.
Medford&#x27;s Lava Lanes bowling alley previously hosted the PBA&#x27;s Medford Open every January, which aired on ESPN; the last Open took place in 2009.

There are no passenger trains that route through Medford. Amtrak trains serve nearby Klamath Falls. People in Medford can board the Southwest POINT Klamath Shuttle Amtrak Thruway (an inter-city bus route) at the RVTD Front Street Transfer Station for a two-and-a-half-hour ride and guaranteed connection with Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; train at the Klamath Falls Amtrak Passenger Rail Station. The last direct service was provided by the Southern Pacific Railroad to Portland, ending in 1956.

===Maritime===
The nearest maritime port is the Port of Coos Bay, which is away.

The nearby Rogue River was monitored for flooding at the former &quot;Gold Ray Dam&quot; site, a decommissioned and now removed hydroelectric dam built in 1906 near Gold Hill. The National Weather Service identifies as the flood level. At this depth, navigability between the Pacific Ocean and the Rogue Valley is limited. Even a small &quot;handysize&quot; freighter is unable to make the trip, and any ship hauling cargo to Medford would have to have a much smaller draw. Therefore, Medford does not have a nearby maritime port.

===Police Department===
As of 2018, the Medford Police Department has 103 sworn police officers supported by a staff of 33 civilian employees and 30 volunteers.

==Sister cities==
Shortly after the sister city program was established in 1960, Medford was paired up with Alba, Piedmont, Italy. The cities are apart and were paired based on 1960 similarities in population, geography, and climate.

Every other year, Alba and Medford take turns exchanging students. During March and April of one year, students from Medford&#x27;s high schools will visit Alba and stay with host families. Likewise, Alba students will visit Medford every other year. Sixty-seven Medford students applied for the 2007 trip to Italy, but only 24 were selected.

It was former mayor of Medford John W. Snider who selected Alba during his 1957–1962 term, making a satellite phone call to Alba&#x27;s former mayor Osvaldo Cagnasso.

<text>Phoenix is a city in Jackson County, Oregon, United States. The population was 4,538 at the 2010 census. Phoenix is a part of the Medford Metropolitan Statistical Area, in the Rogue Valley, and is southeast of Medford on Interstate 5.

==History==
The area was settled in about 1850 by brothers Hiram and Samuel Colver. Samuel Colver laid out the town in 1854. Early residents included Milton Lindley, who operated a sawmill that provided timbers in 1855 for a blockhouse as well as a flouring mill owned by Sylvester M. Wait. For a time, the settlement was known locally as &quot;Gasburg&quot; after a talkative employee in the kitchen serving the mill hands. Wait, who was an agent for the Phoenix Insurance Company of Hartford, Connecticut, assigned the official name, &quot;Phoenix&quot;, to the community and, in 1857, to its post office. Waitsburg, Washington, was later named after Wait.

Officials stated that the Almeda Drive Fire was human-caused. On September 11, a man was arrested for arson, for allegedly starting a fire that destroyed multiple homes in Phoenix and merged with the Almeda Drive Fire.

Its biggest weekend was April 10–12, 2020, when it earned more than $11,000 at the box office.

<text>Rogue River is a city in Jackson County, Oregon, United States. As of the 2020 census the population was 2,407.

==History==
In the early days the gold seekers forded the Rogue River, and during high water they swam across by holding the tails of their horses. Thus the river crossing near the present City of Rogue River, became known as Tailholt. 

About 1850 or 51, Davis Evans built a ferry and two cabins at the mouth of Evans Creek. From there a trail was made by the mules of the pack trains that freighted supplies to the gold mines. According to John Breeding, who later freight supplies over the trail on mules and in carts made from the front wheels of wagons, the trail led up Evans Creek, then cut across to Ditch Creek where it passed the hewed log house of the old Burkhart ranch, and ran along the field and over the mountain gap to Jump-Off Joe Creek. A few log cabins, widely scattered over the area marked the locations of the early settlers&#x27; homesteads and mining claims.

In 1868, according to an old newspaper clipping, a covered bridge was built beside the big live oak tree near the ferry, for the stage road crossing of Evans Creek. Samuel A. Steckel furnished timbers to repair the bridge in 1883. When it was dismantled in 1912 some of the timbers, 80 feet in length, were so well preserved they were saved for use in the bridge eight miles up the creek.

In 1872, John Woods settled on the East side of Evans Creek, and soon the town of Woodville was built. The lumber for the first frame houses in Evans Valley and in Woodville was sawed by a sash mill located four miles up Evans Creek. Its single blade was powered by the water wheel of the old mill dam. Steckel owned and ran the mill for many years. 

In 1912, the town was renamed City of Rogue River. The Woodville post office operated from 1876 until 1912, when the name was changed to Rogue River.

==History==
A. P. Tallent, an East Tennessee native who settled in Oregon in the 1870s, platted the city in the 1880s.

Earlier names for the settlement were &quot;Eden District&quot; and &quot;Wagner Creek&quot;.

===2020 fire===

<text>Culver is a city in Jefferson County, Oregon, United States. The population was 1,357 at the 2010 census.

== History ==

Orace Gabriel Collver moved from Coos Bay, Oregon, to Central Oregon and founded the town of Culver. Since he was the postmaster, he got to name the town, but to avoid confusion with another town with similar spelling and sound, he changed it to Culver. He built a general store, which housed the post office and became the center of the community. In 1911, the railroad came through, but on the opposite side of the valley, so the town relocated to the railroad. Collver had the whole house moved to the new location, while the townspeople used the lumber from their old homes and buildings to build new ones. The upstairs of his store housed a meeting hall that was used for local events and dances.

Collver married Margaret J. Barnett on October 16, 1881. They raised Ruth Church, the daughter of his sister, Sarah Collver Church, after Sarah&#x27;s death.

<text>Madras ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Jefferson County, Oregon, United States. Originally called &quot;The Basin&quot; after the circular valley the city is in, it is unclear whether Madras was named in 1903 for the cotton fabric called &quot;Madras&quot; that originated in the city of Madras (now Chennai) in Tamil Nadu, India or from the name of the city itself. The population was 6,046 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The original plat for Madras was filed on July 18, 1902, by Scandinavian immigrant John A. Palmehn, for whom the town was originally named &quot;Palmain&quot;. The name was rejected by the U.S. Postal Service over its similarity to a post office named Parmen, and the name &quot;Madras&quot; was adopted, inspired by the cloth fabric of the same name, itself named for the city of Madras (now Chennai) in India.

Madras was incorporated as a city in 1911. An Army Air Corps base was built nearby during World War II. This airfield now serves as the Madras Municipal Airport. Homesteads approximately north of the city on Agency Plains were based on dryland wheat.

===GMO incident===
In 2003, a Scotts Company large field trial of GMO bentgrass near Madras resulted in pollen spreading the transgene, which is Roundup-resistant, over an area of . 
Because the grower could not remove all genetically engineered plants, the U.S. Department of Agriculture fined the grower $500,000 for non-compliance with regulations in 2007.

===2017 solar eclipse===

The centerline of the path of totality of the Solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, ran through the center of Madras. Because the city is located in a high desert environment and has consistently clear skies in August, it was considered a prime eclipse viewing location. All of the hotel and motel rooms in the area had been reserved for several years. The town had prepared for an influx of about 100,000 visitors for the eclipse.

==Sights==
Madras is home to the Erickson Aircraft Collection, a privately owned collection of airworthy vintage aircraft. The collection is open to the public Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Jefferson County Fair is held on county property along Fairgrounds Road in Madras.

<text>Metolius is a city in Jefferson County, Oregon, United States, named for the Metolius River, a nearby tributary of the Deschutes River. The name for both comes from the Warm Springs or Sahaptin word &quot;mitula&quot;, meaning &quot;white salmon&quot; and referring to a light colored Chinook salmon and not a whitefish. The population was 710 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
This region experiences warm and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above . According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Metolius has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.

== History ==

Metolius was founded in the early 1900s. The earliest records are from 1903 and written in German.

In February 1911 the Oregon Trunk Railroad built a depot, turntable and roundhouse in the town. The railroad was connected to Bend, Oregon. Railroad engines at the time needed water at regular intervals, and Metolius was chosen as a servicing spot. Electricity was provided in 1912 from a small dam at the Cove. A high school and grade school were built in 1913. The town continued to prosper during the war years and by 1917, the population was over 1,700, and the town had two banks, two newspapers, a flour mill, hotels, general stores, hardware stores and a railroad maintenance hub.

As railroad technology improved, maintenance stations were required less frequently and the Metolius shop was eliminated. Without the railroad base, the population of Metolius went into decline. A major fire in the 1920s destroyed most of the downtown buildings. Drought from 1924 to 1926 bankrupted many farmers, and the Great Depression almost finished the town off. By 1945 the population was down to about 45 people.

Prior to the 1940s, only dry farming existed in the area. An irrigation project diverting water from the Deschutes River boosted farming output and the town began to grow again. Water from the Deschutes river reaches the area through an extensive canal system. Farmers were now able to grow large crops, mostly mint, potatoes and hay. By 1960 over 3,000 railroad cars of fresh potatoes were loaded each year from the area. Four giant packing sheds stored fresh packed potatoes and delivered them onto railroad cars. A frozen French fry factory employed many workers year round. In 1968 a potato blight of nematodes ended large-scale potato production in the area. In 1973 the railroad closed its depot in Metolius. By 1990 almost all mint production had ended due to root rot. As of 2007, most agricultural production around Metolius is marginal.

In 1950 Metolius Elementary began to grow out of the 1913 high school building with a new gym and two classrooms. Four more classrooms were built in 1955 to teach the children of the influx of agricultural workers and construction workers building the three dams on the Deschutes River. In around 1963 the old high school was destroyed and the elementary was again expanded to include an office, a library and two more classrooms. Its last expansion occurred in 2000 with the addition of six new classrooms and a large modern library.

The first Spanish-speaking families began to settle in Metolius in the 1950s, drawn by field work hoeing, irrigating and harvesting as well as working in the potato sheds. Non-union mills converting scrap wood from lumber operations hired many more Spanish-speaking workers from Mexico. Now over 50% of the students at Metolius Elementary speak Spanish at home.

Around 1970, a fire in the city&#x27;s Post Office led to the end of the ZIP code for the community, which thereafter shared the ZIP code of nearby Madras. However, in late 2003, city leaders enlisted the help of U.S. Representative Greg Walden to reclaim the code. Despite several attempts to start businesses, Metolius serves mainly as a bedroom community for Madras and other larger towns up to away. A prison is being built in Madras, and new homes are being built for its workers.

<text>Cave Junction is a city in Josephine County, Oregon, United States. The city got its name by virtue of its location at the junction of Redwood Highway (U.S. Route 199) and Caves Highway (Oregon Route 46). As of the 2020 census, the city population was 2,071. Following World War II, timber became the main source of income for residents. As timber income has since declined, the city is attempting to compensate with tourism and branding itself as a haven for retirees.

== History ==
For thousands of years, the Takelma Indians inhabited the Illinois Valley. Their culture was destroyed when gold was discovered in the early 1850s, causing the subsequent Rogue River Wars. After an 1853 treaty, most of the Takelmas lived on the Table Rock Reservation. In 1856, after the wars ended, they were forcibly removed to the Grand Ronde Reservation and the Siletz Reservation.

The first gold in Oregon history was found in the Illinois Valley, as well as the largest gold nugget (). In 1904, more than 50 years after prospectors had started combing the valley for gold, an 18-year-old named Ray Briggs discovered what newspapers at the time called &quot;the most wonderful gold discovery ever reported in Oregon history.&quot; While hunting along Sucker Creek, he discovered gold lying on the ground. He staked a claim and called it the &quot;Wounded Buck Mine,&quot; which produced of gold. The &quot;mine&quot; was a small vein of gold wide, long and deep.

As gold mining in the Illinois Valley became exhausted in the 1860s and 1870s, the residents diversified into ranching, fishing, logging, tourism, and agriculture. In 1874, Elijah Davidson found a cave while on a hunting trip, and is now credited with discovering the Oregon Caves. In 1884, Walter C. Burch heard about the cave from Davidson, and staked a squatter&#x27;s claim at the mouth of the caves. He and his brothers-in-law charged one dollar for a guided tour. According to their advertisement in the &quot;Grants Pass Courier (now the Grants Pass Daily Courier)&quot;, this included camping, plentiful pasture land and &quot;medicinal&quot; cave waters. They attempted to acquire title to the land, but as the land was unsurveyed, they abandoned the idea a few years later.

President William Howard Taft established the Oregon Caves National Monument on July 12, 1909, to be administered by the U.S. Forest Service. In 1923, the Forest Service subcontracted the building of a hotel and guide services to a group of Grants Pass businessmen. By 1926, the monument had a chalet and seven two-bedroom cabins. Traffic into the caves led to a community developing at the junction of the Redwood Highway and the branch highway to the caves (now known as Oregon Route 46). Cave Junction, originally known as Cave City, was established in 1926 on land donated by Elwood Hussey. In 1935, a post office was applied for and was named &quot;Caves City&quot;, however postal authorities disapproved of the name, partly because &quot;City&quot; implied the place was incorporated. Among the other names suggested was &quot;Cave Junction&quot;, which was adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names in 1936 with the post office being renamed the same year. The locality was incorporated as Cave Junction in 1948, and is the only incorporated area in the Illinois Valley.

In 1950 Cave Junction had a population of 283, which decreased to 248 in 1960 and increased to 415 in 1970. Its growth was fast in the 1960s, increasing at an average of 6.8 percent annually. The city population&#x27;s primary growth period occurred in the 1970s, with an average annual increase of 9.9 percent. Growth slowed in the 1980s when the population increase averaged only 1.7 percent annually. The rate fell further between 1990 and 1998, averaging 1.6 percent, which was less than the state and county averages.

=== Forest fires ===
A number of wildfires have threatened Cave Junction over the years. The Longwood Fire in 1987, part of the Silver Fire complex, was ignited by lightning strikes following a three-year drought. Numerous residents of Cave Junction evacuated.

In 2002, the Florence and Sour Biscuit fires converged, creating the Biscuit Fire. This fire threatened Cave Junction, Kerby, Selma and a number of Northern California communities. Ultimately, the Biscuit Fire lasted 120 days, burned in southern Oregon and northern California, and destroyed four homes and nine outbuildings in the Cave Junction area. In 2003, a wildfire destroyed a home in Cave Junction. In 2004, a downed power line caused a fire that briefly threatened over 100 homes and forced 200 people to evacuate. One person died, apparently of stress related to the fire.

Labor Day of 2020 sparked hundreds of fires across the entire North American west coast, including the Slater fire, which swiftly moved north from Happy Camp overnight to the Illinois Valley. Wildland firefighters, experienced community members, and the inversion layer created by the intensity of smoke stopped the fire from moving much further. The nearby Devil fire and the Slater fire continued to burn through November of 2020 but did not grow much at all or take with it any structures in the IV community.

== Economy ==

Starting in the early 1850s, gold mining was the main source of income in the Illinois Valley. As gold mining dwindled in the 1860s and 1870s, the economy diversified into ranching, fishing, logging, tourism and agriculture. In the years after World War II, timber became an increasingly large part of the county&#x27;s finances. There were 30 lumber mills operating in the valley after the war, but by the late 1980s the number had dwindled to just one.

Because of President Roosevelt&#x27;s creation of the Siskiyou National Forest, and the reversion of Oregon and California Railroad lands to federal government control, by 1937 the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management were in charge of 70% of the land in Josephine County, and a large part of the Illinois Valley. Because this decreased the county&#x27;s potential tax base, the government shared money earned from timber sales with the county, and payments in lieu of taxes from the federal government became a large part of its tax base. In 1989, Josephine County received $16,756,000 in various federal payments; by 1999, the payments had fallen to $9.6 million.

Because of these budget cutbacks, Southern Oregon has used tourism as a means of attracting small businesses and retirees. The movement of California retirees in particular has helped the economy grow. Although jobs have been created as a result, they are usually low-paying. Today the principal industries are tourism, timber and agriculture. Since about 1960, the community has evolved into a center for wine, retirement, tourism, and small businesses. In November 2007, Rough &amp; Ready completed a $6 million biomass plant to replace their existing wood-fired boiler, as market forces have increased demand for dry timber. It finally closed in November, 2016.

The Illinois Valley Community Development Organization (IVCDO), formed in 1994, has attracted notice for its work directed at improving the Illinois Valley economy. In 2006, Cave Junction was awarded the Great Strides Award by the Northwest Area Foundation for the IVCDO&#x27;s efforts to reduce long-term poverty. In 2004, the IVCDO began a partnership with the National Park Service that resulted in the assumption of 40 seasonal and year-around jobs managing the Oregon Caves Chateau. The project uses local produce, food products and wine at the Chateau, and the proceeds are directed back into the local community. However, the Oregon Caves Chateau has been closed since 2018.

== Culture ==
Cave Junction has a number of points of interest, including a museum, a zoo, and a resort consisting of treehouses. It also has a number of historic sites, many related to gold mining, as well as an Oregon state park and a national monument and preserve, all located in the greater Cave Junction area. Cave Junction has one newspaper and one radio station.

=== Tourism ===

Cave Junction&#x27;s main point of interest is the Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve, which is a area of hiking trails and caverns. Located at the end of a &quot;stomach churning&quot; drive along State Route 46, there are limestone caves discovered in 1874 by a hunter and his dog. At the caves, there is a 23-room chateau that was built in 1932.

Each year Cave Junction features an ArtWalk on the second Friday of each month, except during the winter, with the city&#x27;s businesses exhibiting various types of art such as pottery, iron art, music and fire dancing. The ArtWalk adds significantly to the Illinois Valley&#x27;s positive image and increases tourism and adds to the local economy. According to surveys conducted in 2006 by the Arts Council of Southern Oregon, the city sees a 30–50 percent increase in sales and visitors during the event. Attendance is approximately 150–200 people, with roughly 15 percent coming from outside the community. Local artists, including students of Lorna Byrne Middle School in 2007, participate while local businesses, including thrift stores and art galleries, serve as hosts.

Located about southeast of Cave Junction, in Takilma, Oregon, is the home of the Out&#x27;n&#x27;About Treehouse Treesort, a multi-treehouse resort run by Michael Garnier using Garnier limbs. Garnier developed the Garnier limb, which is a one-and-a-half-inch-thick bolt surrounded by a cuff, both made of Grade 5 steel, and is able to support . As of 2007, the treesort has nine treehouses, three with bathrooms. Garnier had to fight local government ordinances for almost ten years before gaining the right to house guests in his nine treehouses.

Great Cats World Park is located a few miles south of Cave Junction. As of 2007, it has 32 cats, of 17 different species, including cougars, leopards, jaguars, lions, Siberian tiger cubs, a fishing cat, and an ocelot. Other attractions include the It&#x27;s a Burl handcrafted wood gallery and the Kerbyville Museum, both in Kerby. Cave Junction&#x27;s Wild River Brewery serves one of the smallest communities of any Oregon brewery. Founded in 1975 as the Pizza Deli, a microbrewery was added in 1989. In 1994, the name Wild River was adopted and a Wild River restaurant and pub was opened in Grants Pass.

=== Wine ===
The Illinois Valley is the coolest and wettest of the three valleys in the Rogue Valley American Viticultural Area. In the late 1960s and early 1970s a new group of Oregonians started experimenting with growing grapes and making wine. Initially this group was not very successful, but 40 years later, Oregon is considered a prestigious growing area. Southern Oregon is higher, and its climate is often warmer, than better known wine producing valleys such as Napa Valley to the south and Willamette Valley and Columbia Valley to the north. The Illinois Valley has dry warm summers and cold nights, which make it well suited for pinot noir, in contrast to the hotter and drier Rogue and Umpqua valleys. Several vineyards and wineries are located near Cave Junction, including Bridgeview Vineyards, Foris Vineyards Winery, and Bear Creek Winery which are all discussed in Fodor&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;Oregon Wine Country.&quot;

Cave Junction is the home of Bridgeview Vineyards, one of the largest wineries in Oregon. Bridgeview is noted for its chardonnay, pinot gris and pinot noir. At the 2000 American Wine Awards, Bridgeview&#x27;s 1998 Bridgeview Oregon Blue Moon was selected as the best pinot noir under $15. Its estate in the Illinois Valley is planted in the European style of dense row and vine spacing. Bridgeview also has an vineyard in the Applegate Valley. Foris Vineyards Winery is also located in the Cave Junction area. Established in 1986, as of 2007, they produced 48,000 cases of wine, making it the 14th largest bonded winery in Oregon.

=== Historic sites ===
Cave Junction has a number of historic sites related to its early gold mining days, including various mines, ditches, and Logan Cut. The historic Osgood Ditch in Takilma provided water for early mining operations in the Illinois Valley. Although mining in the Illinois Valley started in the rivers, gold was soon discovered in gravel beds high up the slopes above the rivers. It had been deposited by ancient rivers that then eroded deep into the earth. To extract this gold, prospectors created ditches to bring the water to these areas. The water was then moved through piping to the desired location. The pressure the water built up as it dropped was used for hydraulic mining. Water cannons fired water over , and the debris was run through a sluice box. Gold was located within pockets in the gravel, and because the miners could not predict where the pockets were, almost every gravel deposit in the Illinois Valley was mined. The Illinois Valley&#x27;s largest gold rush town, Waldo, Oregon, was located on a gravel deposit and was eventually destroyed when its gravel bed was run through a sluice box, along with most of the town. Today nothing of Waldo remains. The Osgood Ditch provided water for mining operations near Waldo. One building of note in the area is the Oregon Caves Chateau, which is a National Historic Landmark.

One of the well known mining communities AltHouse established the AltHouse Church in 1893 about a 1/4 mile down on Dick George Road. This church is one of the oldest building in the valley still standing and still in use. Between 1895–99 the church was moved down to its present site on Holland Loop Road where it has served the community till this day. It is currently known as Bridgeview Community Church since the 1920s). A newer building was built in 1986 where services are now being held every Sunday. The original church is currently under restoration and will continue to be as the builders back then said; &quot;A place for us or children and grandchildren to worship&quot;.

=== Sports and recreation ===
Cave Junction has a golf course and a state park. The Illinois Valley Golf Course has 9 holes, and as of 2007 there are plans for an expansion to 18 holes. The Illinois River Forks State Park is located at the confluence of the east and west forks of the Illinois River. The park includes restrooms, picnic tables, and a variety of rare plants. In 2014 a new disc golf course was built at the Illinois River Forks State Park. There is also a skate park at Jubilee Park in Cave Junction, which was built largely by volunteers and money raised through fundraisers and community involvement.

=== Media ===
Cave Junction has one newspaper and two radio stations. The local paper, the &quot;Illinois Valley News&quot;, is a paper of record for all of Josephine County. Established in 1937 when Cave Junction was known as Cave City, and as of 2018 has a circulation of 2,280. The Valley&#x27;s longest running business is published every Wednesday by Daniel J. Mancuso and edited by Laura M. Mancuso.

The city&#x27;s only licensed radio station is KXCJ-LP (FM 105.7), a community powered station which went on-air in December 2016.

The Cave Junction area had a pirate radio station, Hope Mountain Radio. It broadcast out of Takilma until repeated interference from government agents caused them to shut down. The station then began broadcasting legally on the internet at TakilmaFM.com, although this caused their costs to go up and necessitated fundraising activities. As of January 2007, Hope Mountain Radio broadcasts 24 hours a day with an all volunteer staff.

== Education ==
Cave Junction has four schools: Illinois Valley High School, Kalmiopsis Community Arts High School, Lorna Byrne Middle School, and Evergreen Elementary School. These schools are part of the Three Rivers School District, which also encompasses schools from Grants Pass and Applegate, Oregon.

Two individuals linked to Illinois Valley High School (IVHS) have been inducted into regional halls of fame. In 2004, Sam Hutchins became a member of the Wild Salmon Hall of Fame for creating the non-profit Oregon Stewardship Program. Begun in 1992 to teach Illinois Valley High School students about wild steelhead in the Illinois River, by 2004 the program had been expanded to 25 schools and 1,500 students. In 2007, IVHS wrestling coach Ursal &quot;Jay&quot; Miller was inducted into the Oregon Chapter of The National Wrestling Hall of Fame &amp; Museum.

== Transportation ==
The Illinois Valley Airport, also known as the Siskiyou Smokejumper Base, was built by the U.S. Forest Service. It operated from 1943 to 1981 as a smokejumper base, during which time the smokejumpers parachuted on 1445 fires for 5390 fire jumps. As of 2007, the airport had a fixed-base operator, aircraft rentals and instruction, hangar rentals, and a restaurant.

== Notable people ==
Cave Junction has a number of notable residents and past residents. Actor John Wayne was a visitor to a ranch in Selma, Oregon, about north of town. He grew fond of the area after filming &quot;Rooster Cogburn&quot; along the Rogue River. This ranch has since become the Deer Creek Center which houses the Siskiyou Field Institute. Kristy Lee Cook, who was a contestant on American Idol 7, was also raised in Selma, where she used to live before joining the competition. Arthur B. Robinson is the head of the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, which is about from Cave Junction. He also represents the city in Oregon’s 2nd State Senate District.

==History==
Early Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company hunters and trappers, following the Siskiyou Trail, passed through the site beginning in the 1820s.

The Oregon–Utah Sugar Company, financed by Charles W. Nibley, was created, leading to a sugar beet factory being built in Grants Pass in 1916. Before the factory opened, Oregon-Utah Sugar was merged into the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company. Due to labor shortages and low acreage planted in sugar beets, the processing machinery was moved to Toppenish, Washington, in 1918 or 1919.

The name &quot;Klamath&quot; () may be a variation of the descriptive native for &quot;people&quot; (in Chinookan) used by the Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau to refer to the region.

===History===

The Klamath and Modoc peoples were the first known inhabitants of the area. The Modocs&#x27; homeland is about south of Klamath Falls, but when they were forced onto a reservation with their adversaries, the Klamath, a rebellion ensued and they hid out in nearby lava beds. This led to the Modoc War of 1872–1873, which was a hugely expensive campaign for the US Cavalry, costing an estimated $500,000, the equivalent of over $8 million in 2000. 17 Indigenous people and 83 Americans were killed.

The Applegate Trail, which passes through the lower Klamath area, was blazed in 1846 from west to east in an attempt to provide a safer route for emigrants on the Oregon Trail. The first non-Indigenous settler is considered to have been Wallace Baldwin, a 19-year-old civilian who drove fifty head of horses in the valley in 1852. In 1867, George Nurse, named the small settlement &quot;Linkville&quot;, because of Link River north of Lake Ewauna.

The Klamath Reclamation Project began in 1906 to drain marshland and move water to allow for agriculture. With the building of the main &quot;A&quot; Canal, water was first made available on May 22, 1907. Veterans of World War I and World War II were given homesteading opportunities on the reclaimed land.

During World War II, a Japanese-American internment camp, the Tule Lake War Relocation Center, was located in nearby Newell, California, and a satellite of the Camp White, Oregon, POW camp was located just on the Oregon–California border near the town of Tulelake, California. In May 1945, about east of Klamath Falls, (near Bly, Oregon) a Japanese Fu-Go balloon bomb killed a woman and five children on a church outing. This is said to be the only Japanese-inflicted casualty on the US mainland during the war.

Timber harvesting through the use of railroad was extensive in Klamath County for the first few decades of the 20th century. With the arrival of the Southern Pacific Transportation Company in 1909, Klamath Falls grew quickly from a few hundred to several thousand. Dozens of lumber mills cut fir and pine lumber, and the industry flourished until the late 1980s when the northern spotted owl and other endangered species were driving forces in changing western forest policy.

On September 20, 1993, a series of earthquakes struck near Klamath Falls. Many downtown buildings, including the county courthouse and the former Sacred Heart Academy and Convent, were damaged or destroyed, and two people were killed.
===Water rights controversy===

The city made national headlines in 2001 when a court decision was made to shut off Klamath Project irrigation water on April 6 because of Endangered Species Act requirements. The Lost River sucker and shortnose sucker were listed on the Federal Endangered Species List in 1988, and when drought struck in 2001, a panel of scientists stated that further diversion of water for agriculture would be detrimental to these species, which reside in the Upper Klamath Lake, as well as to the protected Coho salmon which spawn in the Klamath River. Many protests by farmers and citizens culminated in a &quot;Bucket Brigade&quot; on Main Street May 7, 2001, in Klamath Falls. The event was attended by 18,000 farmers, ranchers, citizens, and politicians. Two giant bucket monuments have since been constructed and erected in town to commemorate the event. Such universal criticism resulted in a new plan implemented in early 2002 to resume irrigation to farmers.

Low river flows in the Klamath and Trinity rivers and high temperatures led to a mass die-off of at least 33,000 salmon in 2002. Dwindling salmon numbers have practically shut down the fishing industry in the region and caused over $60m in disaster aid being given to fishermen to offset losses. 90% of Trinity River water is diverted for California agriculture. As much as 90% of the Trinity&#x27;s water, which would otherwise flow into the Klamath and out to sea, instead rushes south toward California&#x27;s thirsty center.

According to a National Academy of Sciences report of October 22, 2003, limiting irrigation water did little if anything to help endangered fish and may have hurt the populations. A contrary report has criticized the National Academy of Sciences report. The Chiloquin Dam has been removed to help improve sucker spawning habitat.

In 2021 tensions between locals and the Federal Government led two local farmers to purchase land at the headgates in Klamath Falls, OR. These farmers have ties to the Ammon Bundy People&#x27;s Rights organization and are preparing for a potential standoff situation with the government.

===Geothermal heating===
Klamath Falls is located in a known geothermal resource area. Geothermal power has been used directly for geothermal heating in the area since the early 1900s. A downtown district heating system was constructed in 1981 and extended in 1982. There was public opposition to the scheme. Many homes were heated by private geothermal wells, and owners were concerned that the city system could lower the water level and/or reduce water temperatures. System operation was delayed until 1984 following an aquifer study. Full operational testing showed no negative impact on the private wells. The system was shut down again in 1986 after multiple distribution piping failures were discovered. By 1991, the distribution piping had been reconstructed, and the system was again operating. The system has been expanded since then, and according to the Oregon Institute of Technology, the operation is &quot;at or near operational break-even&quot;. The system is used to provide direct heat for homes, city schools, greenhouses, government and commercial buildings, geothermally heated snowmelt systems for sidewalks and roads, and process heat for the wastewater treatment plant.

===Air quality===
According to the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality in 2012, significant efforts are being made to improve the air quality in the Klamath Basin.

<text>Malin is a city in Klamath County, Oregon, United States. The population was 805 at the 2010 census.

==History==
According to Lewis A. McArthur, Malin was settled September 30, 1909, on land that was formerly at the bottom of Tule Lake by 65 Bohemian families who named the new town for the Czech town Malín, now part of Kutná Hora. The settlers had found a large horseradish, and Malin is famous for that plant. McArthur also alludes to the discovery of fossils near Malin in 1925. Many surviving descendants of these original Czech families still call Malin home and maintain family farms.

<text>Lakeview is a town in Lake County, Oregon, United States. The population was 2,418 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Lake County. The city bills itself as the &quot;Tallest Town in Oregon&quot; because of its elevation, above sea level. Lakeview is situated in the Goose Lake Valley at the foot of the Warner Mountains and at the edge of Oregon&#x27;s high desert country. Its economy is based on agriculture, lumber production, and government activities. In addition, tourism is an increasingly important part of the city&#x27;s economy. Oregon&#x27;s Outback Scenic Byway passes through Lakeview. 

== History ==
Native Americans probably occupied the area around Lakeview as early as 14,000 years ago, as evidenced by artifacts found in the Paisley Caves north of Lakeview. European explorers came through the Goose Lake Valley, Shoshone-speaking people were living in the area.

In 1827, Peter Skene Ogden led a brigade of Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trappers through the Goose Lake Valley. He was followed in 1832 by John Work and his trappers. Work noted the hot springs north of Goose Lake (now called Hunter&#x27;s Hot Springs) in his journal. The hot springs are approximately north of the Lakeview town site.

In 1867 and 1868, General George Crook led United States Army units and Indian scouts from the Wasco and Warm Springs tribes in a successful campaign against Northern Paiute bands in Eastern Oregon and Northern California. This was part of the conflict known as the Snake War. Crook used Camp Warner as his supply depot and administrative headquarters. The camp was abandoned in 1874. Camp Warner was northeast of the site now known as Lakeview.

In 1869, M. W. Bullard settled along Bullard Creek at the mouth of Bullard Canyon at the northern end of the Goose Lake Valley. This became the town of Lakeview. William Heryford brought cattle into the Goose Lake Valley in 1872. In 1873, the area&#x27;s first post office was opened at the Tenbrook Ranch, south of present-day Lakeview.

Lake County was separated from Jackson County and Wasco County in 1874. The temporary county seat was in Linkville (now Klamath Falls, Oregon). In June 1876, an election was held to select a permanent county seat. Prior to the election, W. M. Bullard offered to donate along Bullard Creek in the Goose Lake Valley as a site for the county courthouse. In the election, &quot;Bullard Creek&quot; received 120 votes while Linkville got only 88 votes. However, a majority of 384 votes was needed to determine the permanent county seat. Bullard Creek fell short because many voters wrote in names like &quot;Goose Lake&quot;, &quot;Goose Lake Valley&quot;, &quot;Bullard&#x27;s ranch&quot;, or &quot;Bullard&#x27;s creek&quot;. As a result, a second election was November 1876. Prior to that election, the town of Lakeview was organized at a meeting of Goose Lake Valley residents. The town site they selected was on Bullard Creek. In the second election, the new town site of Lakeview replaced Linkville as Lake County&#x27;s seat of government. After the election, Bullard donated for the county courthouse as promised. Bullard sold an additional to John A. Moon, who filed a town plat with the state of Oregon, officially creating the town of Lakeview. The Lakeview post office was opened on December 8, 1876.

On May 22, 1900, a fire burned most of Lakeview. There were no deaths, but 64 buildings were destroyed. Only two business structures in the downtown area survived the fire. However, the staff of the &quot;Lake County Examiner&quot; newspaper rescued enough equipment and material to publish a special edition the day after the fire. Most of the town was rebuilt by October of that year. The town&#x27;s rapid recovery was due in large part to the financing and leadership provided by Bernard Daly.

The federal government established the Goose Lake Forest Reserve in 1906. Later that year, the name was changed to &quot;Fremont National Forest Reserve&quot; to honor Captain John C. Fremont, an explorer of the area in 1843. In 1908, the Fremont National Forest was created, and is managed by the United States Forest Service. The forest headquarters was in Lakeview.
In 1909, the &quot;Oregon Valley Land Company&quot; conducted a week-long auction to dispose of land grants acquired from the construction of the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road in 1865 and 1869. The auction was advertised nationwide. The rural parcels also included a separate town lot in Lakeview. Thousands of people came to Lakeview for the auction, but others purchased plots sight-unseen. During the auction, a total of were sold in approximately 14,000 parcels. Few buyers moved onto the land they purchased. Lake County used part of the taxes they collected from the sale to finance a new county courthouse. The new brick courthouse was built in the center of town, replacing the wooden building serving as the county court since 1876.

In 1911, a narrow-gauge railway connected Lakeview with Reno, Nevada. The Nevada-California-Oregon Railway operated the line until 1927, then it was sold to the Southern Pacific Railroad. Southern Pacific converted the track to standard gauge. The new standard rail connection prompted several sawmills to operate in Lakeview, expanding the town&#x27;s economic base.

In 1913, William P. Heryford commissioned the construction of a three-story commercial building in downtown Lakeview, across the street from the Lake County courthouse. The Heryford Brothers Building cost approximately $100,000 to construct. After it was completed, the building was the largest and most expensive structure in Lakeview. It was also the most modern, with an electric generator, central steam-heat, elevators, electric lights, hot water, and telephones.

By 1940, Lakeview had seven sawmills operating in town. All of the mills had new dry kilns for year-around operations. This increased winter employment opportunities in Lakeview, increasing economic stability in the community. The number of sawmills decreased during World War II, leaving only three by 1946. That year, 39,000,000 board feet of timber was cut on the Fremont National Forest. However, that national forest&#x27;s timber harvest increased to 81,200,000 board feet per year by 1952. To accommodate this increase, Lakeview&#x27;s sawmills were expanded and modernized. In the 1950s, the payrolls and income from Lakeview&#x27;s sawmills accounted for more than half of the town&#x27;s economy.
In the mid-1950s, uranium mining claims were filed in the mountains north of Lakeview. However, only two mines, &quot;White King&quot; and &quot;Lucky Lass&quot;, were developed. In 1958, the Lakeview Mining Company uranium processing plant was built on the outskirts of Lakeview. The mill had the capacity to process 210 tons of uranium ore daily. The mill employed 50 people; another 120 people were employed at the two mines. The uranium plant closed in 1961.

In 1985, Southern Pacific announced they planned to abandon their spur line to Lakeview. However, the company continued to operate the line until it was purchased by Lake County in January 1986. Lake County contracted operation of the line to Great Western Railway. In 1996, Lake County took over the railroad operation, then renamed it the Lake County Railroad. From 2007, the Modoc Northern Railroad leased the line from the county. In 2009, &quot;Frontier Rail&quot; operated the line under the name &quot;Lake Railroad&quot;.

The wettest calendar year since record-keeping started in 1888 is 1998 with ; the driest was 1924 with – less than the total for the wettest month of December 1964 of fall, including the melt from of snow. The most snowfall in a calendar month was in February 1894, and the most in a season at least (some days unavailable) between July 1893 and June 1894, in contrast to which as little as fell in the drought season between July 1923 and June 1924.

==Economy==

Lakeview&#x27;s economy is based on agriculture, lumber, and government. Cattle ranching and hay production are important elements of the local economy. The Fremont–Winema National Forest provides timber for lumber and wood products. The Collins Companies operates a sawmill in Lakeview. Because agricultural and lumber-related employment varies with the seasons, government agents of the national forest, of the Bureau of Land Management, and other agents significantly influence the community&#x27;s economic base. Tourism is a growing part of the economy because of the many recreational opportunities in the area.

Lakeview is the county seat of Lake County. A significant number of people in Lakeview are federal and state government agents. In addition to government employment, Lakeview has several schools, a hospital, a sawmill, a perlite mine, and a wide range of agriculture enterprises. According to the &quot;2012 American Community Survey&quot; conducted by the United States Census Bureau, the largest areas of employment in Lakeview are health care (18%), government agents (17%), agriculture and forestry (10%), manufacturing (9%), retail (9%), technical professions (7%), and transportation (6%).

The Fremont National Forest was &#x27;administratively&#x27; combined with Winema National Forest in 2002. Lakeview was selected as the location for the combined Fremont–Winema National Forest headquarters of the government agents. Lakeview is also the home of the Lakeview Ranger District, an &#x27;administrative&#x27; sub-division of the Fremont–Winema National Forest. The Bureau of Land Management&#x27;s Lakeview District is in the national forest headquarters. The &quot;Lakeview Interagency Fire Center&quot; is in Lakeview. The center coordinated wildfire suppression activities between the local agents including the United States Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and the Oregon Department of Forestry.

The nearby &quot;Warner Creek Correctional Facility&quot; opened in 2005. The penitentiary was opposed by Lake County voters. The minimum-security penitentiary, northwest of the city, employs a staff of 100 and holds about 400 convicts.

Tourism is an important part of Lakeview&#x27;s economy. Lakeview claims the title of &quot;Tallest Town in Oregon&quot; because of the elevation. It is part of the &quot;Oregon Outback&quot;, attracting tourist, sportsmen, and outdoors enthusiasts. Local attractions include fishing, birdwatching, camping, hang gliding, paragliding, hiking, rockhounding, hunting, and nature viewing.

Since 1999, Lake County and the City of Lakeview offer tax incentives to invite renewable energy companies. Several private development projects resulted. Iberdrola Renewables planned to build a 26.8-megawatt biomass facility to convert sawmill waste and forest slash into electricity.

==Recreation and other points of interest==
In the summer, the Fremont–Winema National Forest&#x27;s Lakeview District provides outdoor recreation opportunities. The Lakeview District has 22 trails open to mountain bike riders. All those trails and more are available for hiking. The national forest has lakes and streams available for sport fishing. There are also camping and picnic sites near Lakeview.

In the winter, alpine skiers can enjoy their sport at Warner Canyon Ski Area. The ski hill is in the Fremont–Winema National Forest northeast of Lakeview on Oregon Route 140. Snowmobiles are also popular during winter.

Lakeview is known as one of the best places in North America for hang-gliding and paragliding, and was designated &quot;the Hang Gliding Capital of the West&quot; in 1991. The national championships for hang-gliding were held in Lakeview in 1993, 1997, 2000, and 2008, while the national championships for paragliding were held in Lakeview in 1998 and 2007. For at least two decades, Lakeview hosted the &quot;Umpteenth Annual Festival of Free Flight&quot; over the Fourth of July holiday weekend, sponsored by the Lake County Chamber of Commerce, and various local businesses. This event draws pilots and families globally for hang-gliding and paragliding.

Lakeview is also known for the hot water geyser, &quot;Old Perpetual&quot;, located at Hunter&#x27;s Hot Springs. The geyser sometimes goes &quot;silent&quot; from about the first of September until around mid-October. Some people attributed this to farm irrigation during the spring and summer; others believe it may be caused by geothermal development the City of Lakeview supplies the Warner Creek Correctional Facility with water for heating. However, the city and the Oregon Department of Corrections deny any cause-and-effect relationship between geothermal development and the geyser&#x27;s periodic dormancy. The government agents claim there is no evidence to identify the cause(s) of the geyser&#x27;s dormancy.

== Education ==
Lakeview High School, the only high school in the city, is part of Lakeview School District #7; serving students in grades 9 through 12. Daly Middle School, was re-located to Lakeview High School in 2012, and serves students in grades 7–8. Lakeview has two elementary schools across the street from each other, Fremont Elementary School houses K-3 while A.D. Hay Elementary School, considered the main building, houses grades 4–6. Since 2013, the former Daly Middle School building is the Klamath Community College&#x27;s Innovative and Learning Center. The new Center brings KCC classes and degree programs to Lakeview, removing the obstacle of driving each way to attend classes.

Many students from high schools in Lake County attended college on scholarships provided in trust by pioneer physician Bernard Daly. Known as the Bernard Daly Educational Fund, the funds help over 1,600 Lake County students. Daly was a medical doctor, rancher, banker, and politician. He was associated with an act of &#x27;frontier heroism&#x27; two days after a fire during a Christmas program at the isolated Oregon town of Silver Lake in December 1894. Rancher Ed O&#x27;Farrell rode to Lakeview some 100 miles away in sub-zero temperatures to fetch Daly. The ride took 19 hours, with O&#x27;Farrell switching horses at ranches along his route. Daly and driver William Duncan made the return trip to Silver Lake in 13 hours using a buggy. During those two days, forty-three people perished from the fire, the worst in Oregon history.

The section of Lake County that Lakeview is in is not a part of a community college district, but the county has a &quot;contract-out-of-district&quot; (COD) with Klamath Community College.

<text>Paisley is a city in Lake County, Oregon, United States. It is along Oregon Route 31 between Summer Lake and Lake Abert. The population was 250 at the 2020 census.

==History==
There are two theories regarding the origin of the name &quot;Paisley&quot;. One story says that Charles Mitchell Innes, from Scotland, named the place for Paisley in his home country, in about 1873. Another informant stated that the place was named by Samuel G. Steele, also a native of Scotland. Steele was the first postmaster of the Paisley post office, which was established in 1879.

Archeological sites from the 1930s at Paisley Caves and 1966 at Fort Rock give the oldest known evidence for early Native Americans. Radiocarbon dating of coprolites indicate they are from 12,750 to 14,290 years before the present.

==Arts and culture==
Paisley is home to an annual Mosquito Festival that raises funds for vector control. The festival is held the last full weekend of July.

Paisley is also home to the Paisley Players Community Theater, a non-profit organization with a board of directors. The group stages a play each year in the spring, either at the Community Center or the Paisley School Auditorium.

==Geography==

===Geothermal energy===
Paisley sits on top of a supply of hot groundwater. In 1980 on the Colahan Ranch in Paisley, a well was unintentionally drilled into a fault, revealing the hot water. After using the water for irrigation for a time, the Colahans invited the local electricity cooperative to investigate the well&#x27;s use as a geothermal energy source in 2008. The plant was expected to come online in 2013 with a projected energy output of three megawatts using grants from both Federal and State governments for up to seven million dollars. However, by July 2015 the plant had still not come online, and the costs had expanded from a projected twelve million dollars to more than twenty one million dollars, while the amount gained through government grants had fallen to only five million. The plant became operational later that year at a projected 3.1 megawatts capability. The plant was able to generate an estimated 4,129,6800 kilowatt hours of energy over the eight months it was operational during 2016 with a peak output of 2,100 kilowatts.

The speed trap was temporarily ended when Floyd Prozanski, a state legislator from Eugene, sponsored bills to make the practice against the law, effective January 2004.

<text>Cottage Grove is a city in Lane County, Oregon, United States. Its population was 10,643 at the 2020 census. It is the third largest city in Lane County. It is on Interstate 5, Oregon Route 99, and the main Willamette Valley line of the CORP railroad.

==History==
Cottage Grove post office was established in 1855 east of present-day Creswell. It was named by its first postmaster, G. C. Pearce, whose home was in an oak grove. In 1861, the office was moved to the present site of Saginaw; then in the late 1860s, to the southwesternmost part of present-day Cottage Grove, on the west bank of the Coast Fork Willamette River. When the Southern Pacific railroad was built through the area in the 1870s, Cottage Grove station was placed more than half a mile northeast of the post office, on the river&#x27;s east side. This was the start of a neighborhood dispute that lasted for nearly 20 years. The people living near the post office did not want it moved to the railroad station, so a new office was established at the station with the name &quot;Lemati&quot;, a Chinook Jargon word that means &quot;mountain&quot;. Lemati office ran from November 1893 to September 1894, but in March 1898 the Cottage Grove office was renamed Lemati, and ran that way until it was permanently renamed Cottage Grove in May 1898.

The only existing covered railroad bridge west of the Mississippi River, the National Register of Historic Places-listed Chambers Railroad Bridge, is in Cottage Grove. The city restored the bridge in 2011, reopening it on December 3.

Cottage Grove received the All-America City Award by the National Civic League in 1968 and 2004. It has been recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation for over a decade. In October 2008, it was the 17th city in the United States to be recognized as a Green Power Community.

===Lemati===
Cottage Grove was incorporated in 1887, but the people on the city&#x27;s east side rebelled in 1893 and founded East Cottage Grove. The Oregon State Legislature changed its name to Lemati in 1895; the train station&#x27;s signboard said &quot;Cottage Grove&quot;, with &quot;Lemati&quot; appearing in smaller letters. In 1899 an act was passed that consolidated the two towns as Cottage Grove.

<doc id="130841" wikidata="Q862740" url="?curid=130841" title="Florence, Oregon">
<text>Florence is a coastal city in Lane County, in the U.S. state of Oregon. It lies at the mouth of the Siuslaw River on the Pacific Ocean and about midway between Newport to the north and Coos Bay to the south along U.S. Route 101. As of August 14, 2023, the city had a total population of 9,553.

==History==
The Florence area was originally inhabited by the Siuslaw tribe of Native Americans. Some claim that the city was named after state senator A. B. Florence, who represented Lane County from 1858 to 1860; another claim is that Florence was named after a French vessel that was wrecked at the mouth of the Siuslaw River on February 17, 1875.

===Exploding whale===
On November 12, 1970, Florence was the site of a famous scene when the Oregon Department of Transportation used 20 cases of explosives to try to blow up a dead beached whale, with unintended consequences. In 2020, residents voted to name a new park Exploding Whale Memorial Park.

===Accidental ban on sex===
The Florence City Council brought national attention to Florence after it approved a poorly-worded ordinance at its regular meeting on November 26, 1977. Intending to prevent people from having sexual intercourse in view of bystanders, the council approved a measure that made it illegal to have sex &quot;while in or in view of a public or private place.&quot; Days later, a re-reading of the ordinance showed that it applied to sex in private. According to the United Press International report that followed days later, &quot;City officials said they would not enforce the new ordinance until it could be amended.&quot;

==Geography==
Florence is located on the Oregon Coast, at the mouth of the Siuslaw River, just north of Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. It is situated at nearly the same latitude as Eugene, and is located roughly midway between the other main central-coast cities of Newport and Coos Bay. Florence annexed Driftwood Shores Hotel and Conference Center, north of town, in Heceta Beach, in 2008.

To the south of Florence, the unincorporated community of Glenada lies just across the Siuslaw River on U.S. Route 101; the city of Yachats is to the north.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.
==Climate==
Like most of Western Oregon, Florence has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;) though cooler and wetter than usual for the type. The cooling effect of the Pacific makes summers as much as cooler than Eugene by daily mean and cooler by afternoon high. Outside of the short dry season in July and August, rainfall in Florence is generally frequent and heavy, totalling almost twice as much as in the Willamette Valley.

The amalgamation of the former units in this area took place in 1967 when the market town Olofström (itself detached from Jämshög in 1941) was merged with Kyrkhult and Jämshög.

Notable person that Olofström counts as theirs is Nobel Prize winning author Harry Martinson (1904-1978; prize in 1974) who was born in Jämshög within the municipality.

==Geography==

The municipality is covered with forests and lakes. It labels itself &quot;The southernmost wildlife in Sweden&quot;, probably because there are scarcely any forests or lakes south of the Blekinge province.

The highest point in the province and county of Blekinge, Rävabacken (189,65 m), is located in the northern part of the municipality.

===Urban areas===
There are 5 localities classified as urban areas (&quot;tätort&quot; in Swedish) in Olofström Municipality. In addition to that, there is one more recognized locality.

In the table the urban areas and localities are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2006. The municipal seat is in bold characters.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Olofström Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 13,243 residents, including 10,168 Swedish citizens of voting age. 44.1% voted for the left coalition and 55.0% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Parishes==
*Jämshög Parish
*Kyrkhult Parish

==Industry==

The increased use of cars in the 1950s and 60&#x27;s was the great boost for the municipality. Today the car industry, dominated by Volvo Cars, is the largest employer in Olofström with 2,400 employees, and some more working in other companies connected to this industry. The Volvo industry, with related production, is probably the main reason that the municipality&#x27;s commuting surplus (as of 2005) is almost 2,000 a day, with many workers coming from the neighboring municipalities of a.o. Bromölla, Karlshamn and Sölvesborg.

Vilshult is a small village within the municipality, situated 10 km north of the central locality of Olofström. It is recognised for a photovoltaics (PV) modules factory that has been located there since 2001.

<text>Junction City is a city in Lane County, Oregon, United States. As of the 2020 United States Census, it has a population of 6,747.

The Junction City area is notable for its Scandinavian heritage, with the city&#x27;s Scandinavian Festival attracting over 100,000 visitors annually. Junction City was previously a center of recreational vehicle manufacturing.

== History ==


The city was incorporated in 1872. Junction City was named by railroad magnate Ben Holladay, who decided that it would be where the rail line on the east side of the Willamette Valley would meet the rail line on the west side. The westside line, however, was not built according to plan and the rail junction never materialized. Junction City later became the meeting point of the east and west branches of U.S. Route 99 (which divide in Portland).

In 1902, real estate developer A.C. Nielsen subdivided 1,600 acres of farmland near Junction City into small farms and advertised them in a Danish-language newspaper in Iowa. Many families of Danish ancestry subsequently settled in the area. Danish was spoken regularly in the area until the 1940s, with Lutheran Church services offered in Danish until 1951. In 1961, residents of Junction City founded the Scandinavian Festival, an annual event that remains popular to this day, to celebrate the legacy of these and other Scandinavian immigrants to the Junction City area.

In the early 1990s, Junction City voters considered two ballot initiatives aimed at restricting LGBT civil rights. The initiatives sought to ban the city government from enforcing civil rights protections based on sexual orientation and prohibited public money from being spent to “promote” homosexuality. The first ballot initiative was narrowly passed by voters on June 29, 1993, by a vote of 631 to 628 (50.12% in favor). The election was subsequently invalidated due to evidence of voter fraud by supporters. Litigation led by the ACLU of Oregon showed that a Junction City church had allowed several members of their congregation who did not live in Junction City to fraudulently register to vote in Junction City by claiming the church was their residential address. A similar initiative was placed before voters again in March 1994 and passed with a larger margin. In 1995, all Anti-LBGT local ordinances in Oregon were invalidated when the Oregon Supreme Court upheld House Bill 3500.

From 2003 to 2005, a group of local farmers posed for nude calendars to raise money for the Junction City School District. Sales in over 63 countries raised more than $650,000.

Junction City was a center of the RV and motorcoach manufacturing in the 20th Century, with the nickname &quot;The RV Manufacturing Capital of the World.&quot; The city was the home of Country Coach, a large luxury motorcoach manufacturer employing over 2,000 people. Country Coach was liquidated in February 2010 after filing for bankruptcy. It was also the home of Monaco Coach Corporation and Marathon Coach prior to their move to nearby Coburg. Similarly, Guaranty RV Super Center of Junction City was the largest RV dealership in the U.S. No RV or motorhome manufacturers remain in Junction City following the Great Recession.

In March 2015, the Oregon State Hospital opened a Junction City campus with the capacity to serve up to 174 people with severe mental illness.

<doc id="130851" wikidata="Q2369855" url="?curid=130851" title="Oakridge, Oregon">
<text>Oakridge is a city in Lane County, Oregon, United States. The population was 3,205 as of the 2010 census. It is located east of Westfir on Oregon Route 58, about east of Eugene and southeast of Portland. Surrounded by the Willamette National Forest and the Cascade Range, Oakridge is popular with outdoor enthusiasts for its hiking, mountain biking, wildflowers, fly fishing, birding, watersports, and the nearby Willamette Pass Resort.

The city was originally a community called &quot;Hazeldell&quot;, and its post office was established on July 26, 1888. When a station on the Southern Pacific Railroad opened in May 1912, it was named &quot;Oak Ridge&quot; by a railroad executive for the surrounding topography, and on July 19 of that year the name was changed to be spelled as a single word.

The economy of Oakridge and that of nearby Westfir is centered on recreation. Since the lumber mills closed in the 1980s, the economy has been transitioning, with a new general store opening in 2010, a bakery in 2011, and a brewery and mercantile.

==History==
The area now known as Oakridge was first explored by Euro-Americans in 1852 as a possible route for pioneers coming from Central Oregon to the Willamette Valley. Before that Oakridge was the land of the Kalapuya who had villages on the rivers since time immemorial. A post office was named &quot;Hazeldell&quot; in 1888, and the place&#x27;s name later changed to &quot;Big Prairie&quot;, and then &quot;Oak Ridge&quot;. In 1912, a new community was formed and officially named Oakridge. Since its beginnings as a mountain ranch, Oakridge has been a railroad boomtown, a loggers&#x27; haven, and an outdoor enthusiast&#x27;s destination.

The early boom for Oakridge can be attributed to the Southern Pacific Railroad. By 1910, work had already begun on Tunnel 22, a short route connecting Oakridge to the area now known as Westfir. Oakridge was a station on Southern Pacific&#x27;s Cascade subdivision, a line that goes over Willamette Pass via the Natron Cutoff that was built in 1926, and the railroad played an integral part of the economy and lifestyle in Oakridge. The Union Pacific Railroad still operates the rails and trains are a common sight in Oakridge. Today, Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; passes through the town but does not stop.

On July 2, 1946, the Pope and Talbot Lumber Company purchased timberland near Oakridge. By 1948, the company had built a large sawmill and had begun a massive timber logging operation. While the railroad and Westfir&#x27;s Hines sawmill began to slow down, the Pope and Talbot mill expanded and eventually employed more than 500 people. The combined economic base of the railroad and sawmills accounted for the population growth of the 1960s and 1970s, when the community of Willamette City was consolidated into Oakridge. However, in 1978, the Hines mill in Westfir closed, and by 1985 the Pope and Talbot Mill had laid off all of its workers. The City of Oakridge now owns the property that formerly housed the Pope and Talbot sawmill.

In February 2019, an Amtrak &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; train was stranded near Oakridge for over 36 hours, after a rare heavy snowstorm.

<text>Westfir is a city in Lane County, Oregon, United States. The population was 253 at the 2010 census. It is located about southeast of Eugene and about west of Oakridge in the Willamette National Forest.

==History==
The name Westfir was first used for the community in July 1923. The name came from the Western Lumber Company, which produced Douglas-fir lumber and had established Westfir as a company town. A major customer of the mill at this time was the Southern Pacific Railroad, which was building its line over Willamette Pass between Eugene and Klamath Falls in the 1920s and passing through Westfir. Westfir post office was established in November 1923. The population in 1931 was 500. The Western Lumber sawmill was later sold to the Westfir Lumber Company and in 1946 to the Edward Hines Lumber Company. Hines established a plywood mill in Westfir in 1952. In 1977, Hines closed the mills and sold the entire town, including the water and sewer system. The town&#x27;s new owners wanted the utilities to be in public ownership, so local residents voted to incorporate in 1979. The mill operations closed in 1984, after a series of fires.

Oregon&#x27;s longest existing covered bridge, the Office Bridge, was built across the North Fork Middle Fork Willamette River in 1944 to connect the Westfir Lumber Company mill to the main office.

<text>Lincoln City is a town in Lincoln County on the Oregon Coast of the United States, between Tillamook to the north and Newport to the south. It is named after the county, which was named in honor of former U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. The population was 9,815 at the 2020 Census.

== History ==

Lincoln City was incorporated on March 3, 1965, uniting the cities of Oceanlake and Taft, and the unincorporated communities of Cutler City and Nelscott. These were adjacent communities along U.S. Route 101, which serves as Lincoln City&#x27;s main street. The name &quot;Lincoln City&quot; was chosen from contest entries submitted by local school children. The contest was held when it was determined that using one of the five communities&#x27; names would be too controversial.

===Communities===
====Cutler City====
Cutler City is located on the east shore of Siletz Bay. The community was started by Mr. and Mrs. George Cutler. It is claimed they received the property from Chief Charles &quot;Charley&quot; DePoe of the Siletz tribe (part of the present-day Confederated Tribes of the Siletz). Cutler City post office ran from 1930 until the formation of Lincoln City.

====Delake====
Delake is near Devils Lake, and was named for the way the local Finnish people pronounced the name of the lake. Delake post office was established in 1924, and reestablished as Oceanlake (see below) in 1927.

====Nelscott====
Nelscott was named by combining the surnames of Charles P. Nelson (1874-1946) and Dr. W.G. Scott (1882-1938), who founded the community in 1926. Nelscott post office ran from 1929 until incorporation as Lincoln City. Nelscott Reef is known for its surf and was in &quot;Surfer Magazine&quot; in 2003 as one of the Pacific Ocean&#x27;s best places to surf.

====Oceanlake====
Oceanlake was named for its position between Devils Lake and the Pacific Ocean. Its post office ran from 1927 until incorporation as Lincoln City. In 1945, Oceanlake annexed Wecoma Beach and incorporated as a city. The neighborhood is home to Oceanlake Elementary School.

====Taft====
Taft was named for the 27th U.S. president William Howard Taft. Taft post office was established in 1906, and was named when Taft was Secretary of War. The post office ran until incorporation as Lincoln City.
====Wecoma Beach====
Oceanlake annexed Wecoma Beach, a community to the north, and was incorporated on November 3, 1945. &quot;Wecoma&quot; is a Chinook jargon word meaning &quot;sea&quot;. The post office at this locale was originally named Wecoma. It was changed to Wecoma Beach in 1949. The office is no longer in operation.

<doc id="130862" wikidata="Q2400170" url="?curid=130862" title="Toledo, Oregon">
<text>Toledo /toLIdou/ is a city located on the Yaquina River and along U.S. Route 20 in Lincoln County, in the U.S. state of Oregon. The population was 3,465 at the 2010 census. The city was a 2009 All-America City Award finalist.

== History ==
European-American settlement in Toledo began in 1866, when John Graham, his son Joseph, and William Mackey, claimed land made available by the Homestead Act of 1862. The site was called &quot;Graham&#x27;s Landing&quot; until a post office was established two years later. Joseph D. Graham, John&#x27;s son, named the post office for Toledo, Ohio, because he was homesick. William Mackey was the first postmaster.

Toledo was made the county seat of the newly established Lincoln County in 1893. The city incorporated in 1893 and reincorporated in 1905. Charles Barton Crosno served as the first mayor. The county seat moved from Toledo to Newport in 1953. To make matters worse, an improved U.S. Route 20 bypassed the city, (Special routes of U.S. Route 20) and as a result, many businesses relocated to Newport.

In 1918, the Port of Toledo leased land to the Spruce Production Division for a sawmill to cut airplane frames for World War I. However, before production began at the site, the war ended. C. D. Johnson and associates formed a subsidiary, Pacific Spruce Corporation, which in 1920 bought the mill and related equipment, which by 1922 processed logs shipped to Toledo by rail and logs floated down the Yaquina River from nearby Lincoln County Logging camps. Georgia-Pacific acquired the operation in 1952 and turned it into a pulp mill by 1957.

In 1925, the Pacific Spruce Corporation decided to hire Japanese contract labor to sort lumber in its Toledo sawmill. Managers informed local employees that only the Japanese would work the graveyard shift. The sawmill employees did not object, but local businessmen opposed bringing Japanese workers into the community. Two days after the Japanese arrived, a mob forced a Japanese labor crew to leave town. A year later, Tamakichi Ogura filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court alleging that nine individuals had violated his civil rights by assaulting him, stealing his property, and forcibly removing him from the Toledo community. After a nine-day trial, the jury unanimously agreed with Ogura and awarded him $2,500 in damages plus court costs. A book was written about this called The Toledo Incident of 1925.

Between 1927 and 1944, the Creamery Package Manufacturing Company, based in Chicago, operated a substantial sawmill and stock cooperage in Toledo. This mill was dedicated to producing butter tub stock, churning out up to two million spruce butter tubs annually. These tubs were shipped as knockdown kits via rail to three Midwestern factories for regional assembly and distribution, with most designed to hold a generous 63 pounds of butter.

==Education==
There are two public schools in Toledo, which are part of the Lincoln County School District: Toledo Elementary School (K–6) and Toledo High School (7–12). Toledo High School is a combination junior high and high school, and serves students in seventh through twelfth grade.

==Transportation==
Toledo is now the western terminus of a Portland and Western Railroad line. This route was once part of the Oregon Pacific Railroad, which was completed from Yaquina City through Toledo to Corvallis in 1885. This railroad later linked the city to Albany in 1887, with a 4000 foot long bridge across the Willamette River, in the Willamette Valley. The city is also served by the port authority (the Port of Toledo), and Toledo State Airport.

The area&#x27;s railroad history is preserved and celebrated at the Yaquina Pacific Railroad Historical Society (YPRHS) in Toledo. Two local and historic Georgia-Pacific locomotives are on display at the museum. One locomotive is the &quot;One Spot&quot;, a 2-8-2 steamer built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1922. This locomotive spent its entire working career within Lincoln County, from 1922 to 1959. The other locomotive at the museum is a GE 50 ton diesel, built in 1951 for the C.D. Johnson Lumber Co as their No. 8, which was later purchased by Georgia-Pacific. It was donated in 2016 to YPRHS. The Museum also has a restored Southern Pacific 1923 Railway Post Office / Baggage car.

===First brick depot in Oregon===
On 3 August 1893, Toledo became the first city to have a railroad depot made out of brick in Oregon. The reason to build a depot had to do with a dispute of a twenty-foot strip of land. The city of Toledo, at the time, had no depot provided to the citizens. However, the citizens of Toledo made a demand on the railroad commissioners asking that the Oregon Pacific be forced to provide reasonable accommodations there. The people of Toledo and Oregon Pacific agreed to a contract: the people would pay $250 in money and to furnish an equal amount of labor on the building. Oregon Pacific, in return, agreed to erect within sixty days from the date of the contract a brick depot building at Toledo of the size and dimensions as before agreed upon at 20 feet by 60 feet. The depot was later expanded and stuccoed by Southern Pacific Railroad in 1922-1923. The depot was torn down in 1961 to make way for street improvements.

<text>Waldport is a city in Lincoln County, Oregon, United States. The population was 2,033 at the 2010 census. The city is located on the Alsea River and Alsea Bay, south of Newport and north of Yachats.

== History ==
Settlement of Waldport began in 1879 when David Ruble bought squatter’s rights from Lint Starr for $300 for property including the area now known as &quot;Old Town.&quot; Many early settlers were of German descent, and one of the names proposed for this town was Waldport: &quot;wald&quot; meaning forest or trees, and &quot;port&quot; referring to its proximity to the ocean. The plat for the town was recorded on September 9, 1885, and by 1911, when Waldport was incorporated, it boasted a dozen businesses and 150 inhabitants.

The earliest inhabitants of the area were known as the &quot;Alsi&quot; or &quot;Alsea&quot;, a name given to them by the Coos tribe. (Their name for themselves in their own language was &quot;Wusi&quot; or &quot;Wusitslum&quot;.) In 1780 the total number of &quot;Yakonan&quot;, which included tribes from Yaquina Bay to the Siuslaw, was estimated to have numbered upwards of 6,000 and the Alsea river and bay was home to numerous small villages. At the time of Lewis and Clark, the numbers had dwindled to about 1,000, and by 1910 only 29 remained at the Siletz reservation.

Camp Angel, a Civilian Conservation Corps camp near Waldport, was home to World War II conscientious objectors involved in the arts.

In September 1975, Marshall Applewhite and Bonnie Nettles gave a lecture in Waldport on UFOs which was attended by roughly 150 people. In the following days, an estimated 20 residents, nearly one out of 30 people who lived in the town, abandoned their homes and possessions and joined their group, Heaven&#x27;s Gate. An Oregon State Police investigation concluded that no laws had been broken.

<text>Yachats ( ) is a small coastal city in the southernmost area of Lincoln County, Oregon, United States. According to &quot;Oregon Geographic Names&quot;, the name comes from the Siletz language and means &quot;at the foot of the mountain&quot;. There is a range of differing etymologies. William Bright says the name comes from the Alsea placename &quot;yáx̣ayky&quot; ( ). At the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 994.

==History==
Archeological studies have shown that the Yachats area has been inhabited for at least 1,500 years. Remains of a pit-house in Yachats have been radiocarbon dated at approximately 570 AD. Yachats is built on seashell middens and numerous graves left by its past inhabitants. Excavations for construction of buildings and U.S. Route 101 uncovered a great many skeletons and artifacts. Most of these became part of the fill dirt forming the base of the current highway and city.
For many centuries the Native Americans in this area were hunter-gatherers who migrated between summer camps and winter residences. The Alsea Tribe had as many as 20 permanent villages (used on an annually rotating basis) on the Alsea River and the central Oregon coast. Archeological and linguistic evidence support the existence of a southern Alsea village known as the &quot;Yahuch&quot; band, located on the coast at the Yachats River. By 1860, the &quot;Yahuch&quot; band was extinct, many having succumbed to European diseases such as smallpox and tuberculosis.

In order to open up land in the Coos Bay area for homesteading in the early 1860s, the U.S. Army forcibly marched the Coos and Lower Umpqua Indians north over rugged terrain to the Alsea Sub-Agency reservation in Yachats where the peaceful Indians, treated by the Army as though they were prisoners of war, were incarcerated. Amanda&#x27;s Trail, named for a blind Indian woman who suffered greatly on the march, was dedicated on July 19, 2009. The trail climbs from downtown Yachats to the summit of Cape Perpetua where it links with the extensive trail system of the Siuslaw National Forest.

In Yachats the hunter-gatherer tribes were forced to learn to make a living by agriculture. Crops planted near the ocean failed, resulting in many deaths from starvation. Approximately 300 Indians died in just 10 years. Twelve years after the Alsea Sub-Agency had opened, the Indians were allowed to establish a trail and develop agricultural plots up the Yachats River Valley, where they were able to grow potatoes, oats, wheat, and corn. They were also allowed to return to hunting. Once the Indians had built a new life there, the U.S. government opened up the area for homesteading in 1875, and once again, forced the Indians to move—some returned to their ancestral homelands, others went north to the Siletz Reservation. Many of the Indians died during this relocation.

Homesteaders used the Indian farms and trails to develop the Yachats area. In 1892 the first post office was established in Yachats (called Oceanview until it was renamed Yachats in 1917). Until Yachats could be reached by a macadam road, rains made it impossible for the mail to be carried by car. The Roosevelt Memorial Highway (now Highway 101), carved out of the rock of Cape Perpetua in 1931, changed all this by opening up a route from the town of Florence. Despite the early difficulties of reaching Yachats, the tourist industry began in 1905 with the conversion of a chittum bark warehouse into the first hotel. Today tourism is the city&#x27;s main industry.
Yachats was part of the war effort in both world wars. Spruce was needed for airplanes during World War I, and in 1918 the U.S. Army Signal Corps under the Spruce Production Division wanted to commence logging of the Blodgett Tract area, an area about north of Yachats. A logging railroad, the Alsea Southern Railroad, needed for transporting logs to the Yaquina River was completed by the Spruce Production Division from South Beach, Oregon (near Newport, Oregon) to Yachats on November 8, 1918, just three days before the war ended. Logs could then be floated on the river to the mill in Toledo, Oregon. A private company, the Pacific Spruce Corporation under its Manary Logging Company subsidiary, purchased the railroad and completed a large centralized logging facility called &quot;Camp 1&quot; north of Yachats in September 1922. Camp 1 contained a machine shop, locomotive shed, bunkhouses, bungalows, mess hall, school, and commissary. Manary Logging and its successors continued the logging operations in the area until 1937. 

Early in World War II, the West Shelter built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) near the top of Cape Perpetua was used as an observation site and radar station for the detection of enemy submarines and aircraft. In Yachats, foxholes and gun emplacements were installed along the ocean drive. Military personnel were housed in a local skating rink and the Ladies Club was rented for recreation. After the war, the U.S. Coast Guard discovered Japanese mines that had floated onto the beaches. These were hauled out to sea and destroyed.

The Little Log Church is a historical museum displaying many artifacts relating to Yachats&#x27;s past. The church, built in 1926, was designed in the shape of a cross. Sir Robert Perks, who owned most of Yachats at the time, provided the property; the logs were donated as well and the work was contributed by local citizens. The museum is now owned by the city.

==Economy==
The principal industries of Lincoln County are lumber, fishing, tourism and recreation, and food products manufacturing. Tourism is Yachats&#x27;s main industry. 

==Geography and climate==

Yachats is the southernmost city in Lincoln County. It is bounded by the Central Oregon Coast Range on the east and the Pacific Ocean on the west. To the south is a rugged portion of highway around and just south of Cape Perpetua, connecting the city to Lane County on U.S. Route 101. Yachats is almost exactly equidistant between the two most populous coastal cities in Lincoln and Lane counties, respectively, being north of Florence, south of Waldport, and south of Newport. The city straddles the Yachats River and estuary. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The climate of Yachats is relatively mild throughout the year because of the moderating effects of the ocean currents. Temperatures rarely drop below in the winter or rise above in the summer. The highest recorded temperature, however, was in July 1961 and the record low was in December 1972. Snow is uncommon and only occurs in rare offshore flow events with deformation banding in Arctic fronts and overrunning low pressure systems that move inland to the south, but rainfall is quite heavy through the winter months and several storms come out of the Gulf of Alaska each winter.

==Arts and culture==

===Annual cultural events===
The Yachats la de da Parade is held each July 4 at noon. It features anyone in town who wants to participate. Some of the regular entries include the Yachats Umbrella Drill Team, a belly dancing troupe, and a Yachats Fire Department truck accompanied by Dalmatian miniature goats. Starting in 2012, the Oregon Central Coast PFLAG (Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) have also marched in the parade. For the past several years, the Yachats Youth and Family Activities Program (YYFAP) has run a (rubber) duck race in the Yachats estuary shortly following the parade. Then, in the evening, an extensive fireworks display is launched out over the ocean.

The Yachats Music Festival brings 20 to 30 of the world&#x27;s major classical musicians for four concerts throughout a weekend in July. The Yachats event is the summer festival for Four Seasons Arts, an organization that presents annual recitals at Carnegie Hall and the Lincoln Center. This music festival has graced Yachats annually since 1981.
Each October, Yachats is the site of the Yachats Village Mushroom Festival. Some of the world&#x27;s leading experts in mycology provide exhibits, give talks, and guide forest walks. There is also a culinary mushroom-growing workshop. Restaurants in Yachats participate in a Fungi Feast with wild mushroom cuisine. Mushroom-inspired art and music can be found at a number of venues around the town.

During the first weekend of November, the city hosts the Yachats Celtic Music Festival, with performances at several venues, including the auditorium of the Yachats Commons. Many of the world&#x27;s finest Celtic musicians perform there, traveling from Scotland, Ireland, Canada, and various regions of the U.S. to participate. Workshops are held for teaching dances and the playing of instruments such as the bodhran and the tin whistle.

At the Cape Perpetua Scenic Area, the visitor center hosts Whale Watching Weeks in winter and in spring. About 400 gray whales feed along the coasts of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia in the summer. Generally, whales are in the Cape Perpetua area from July through mid-November. These whales can be seen close to shore while feeding. The visitor center also sponsors a Tidepool Discovery Days program each summer and provides guided tidepool walks. The Heceta Head Lighthouse, located south of Yachats, holds a Victorian Christmas Open House each December. Besides the usual guided tours of the historic lighthouse, the Queen Anne style keeper&#x27;s house is thoroughly decorated in a Victorian manner. Visitors are entertained with holiday musical performances and treats.

===Museums and other points of interest===

The Little Log Church and Museum, built in 1926, originally served as an Evangelical Church and later as a Presbyterian Church. Today it is owned and managed by the City of Yachats and houses a large collection of local historical artifacts. It is also a popular venue for weddings, memorials, concerts, and fine arts exhibits. Each Valentine&#x27;s Day, a wedding vow renewal ceremony, open to any couple, is held there.

The North Fork of the Yachats Bridge is a covered bridge in the Yachats River Valley, about east of Yachats. It was completed, at a cost of $1,500, in 1938 and was the last bridge of veteran bridge builder Otis Hamer. A replica was constructed on the site in 1989, and again a replica was completely reconstructed in 2014 at a cost of over $750,000 from approximately two-thirds federal and one-third local tax dollars in the public interest of tourism. It features the queen-post truss style found in few covered bridges today and has ribbon openings under the roof to provide light to the bridge&#x27;s center. Its span is long, making it one of the shortest covered bridges in the Pacific Northwest. Parking and turnaround past the bridge remains obstructed by an adjacent resident, due to ongoing protest of road legalization which established that area NW of the bridge as the current terminus of County Rd. 805.
At one time, the Yachats 804 Trail was part of the major &quot;thoroughfare&quot; running between Yachats and Alsea Bay in Waldport, to the north. For many centuries it was used by Native Americans traveling between the bay and the Yachats River (but only during low tide). Later it was called County Road 804 when it was used for carriage and buggy traffic from the late 19th century until U.S. Highway 101 was built in the 1930s. The historic trail is a footpath that provides views of crashing surf, tidal pools, and native vegetation. Part of the Oregon Coast Trail system, it is maintained by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department. It extends north from a public parking area in Smelt Sands State Recreation Area.

The sanctuary of the Yachats Community Presbyterian Church is lighted by six windows featuring gold-hued panes made of agates collected from the local beaches. The area of these windows totals . They are believed to be the world&#x27;s only windows made of agate.

The Yachats Commons was built in the 1930s and used as a school until 1983. In 1990, the building was bought by the city to serve as a community center. It now houses the city government offices and hosts a wide variety of events, including monthly free movie nights, play readings and drum circles (open to the public), seniors&#x27; luncheons, and concerts of the Yachats Big Band (with ballroom dancing). Periodically, concerts by the Oregon Coast Chamber Orchestra and plays, musicals, and revues by One of Us Productions are performed on the stage in the large auditorium, and a number of art and craft shows are held at the Commons as well. From May through October the Commons is the site of the outdoor Yachats Farmers Market.

 The Yachats Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences sponsors numerous educational and entertainment events, most of which are held at the Commons. Presentations include speakers, films, workshops, exhibitions, and seminars on various topics relating to art, science and the humanities.

The Commons also serves as the venue for premieres of locally filmed movies. The Yachats International Film Festival is devoted to the filming and showing of such films as &quot;Ghoul from the Tidal Pool&quot;. A feature-length, tongue-in-cheek version of the 1950s horror movie genre, this film was made by an all-amateur production team of writers, actors, and crew. The star of the film is local youth Jordan Ostrum.

The Yachats Public Library hosts a perpetual exhibition of paintings, drawings, and photographs by the Yachats Arts Guild. The exhibited works are changed every few weeks. Also, the library houses the Yachats Seed Bank, a repository of vegetable seeds offered free to gardeners. The Seed Bank displays a wide selection of cookbooks, gardening manuals, and guides for developing community sustainability. In addition, the library provides high speed Internet access over its Wi-Fi connection. Computers are available to the public during regular hours. Library cards are free and visitors can check out books while they vacation in Yachats.

==Parks and recreation==

The Yachats area is home to a rich variety of plant and animal life. Its natural history affords the study of marine, montane, and riparian ecological communities and their complex interactions. The following natural attractions are dedicated to the protection, study, and exposition of the plants and wildlife of the central Oregon coast.

The Siuslaw National Forest borders Yachats on the east and consists of over (about five-eighths the area of the state of Rhode Island) extending from Coos Bay in the south to Tillamook in the north. The forest has numerous hiking trails, including those through the virgin stands of Sitka spruce, western hemlock, and Douglas fir in the Cummins Creek and Rock Creek Wilderness areas a few miles south of Yachats. Another network of hiking trails north of Yachats leads to summits such as those of Cannibal Mountain and Burnt Timber Mountain.

The Siuslaw National Forest features Cape Perpetua, located about south of Yachats. Named by Captain James Cook on March 7, 1778, this promontory rises to above sea level, making it the highest point on the Oregon coast. Its West Shelter observation point is a popular site for watching migrating gray whales. At the foot of the cape, the power of the waves has carved a rugged inlet called the Devil&#x27;s Churn. Around on the north slope of the cape, the privately owned and operated Cleft of the Rock Lighthouse is visible from the U.S. 101 Highway.
Yachats Ocean Road State Natural Site is located on the south side of the mouth of the Yachats River. It forms a strip on the bank overlooking the river&#x27;s estuary and the ocean. Picnic tables are available and a stairway leads down to the beach on the north end of the park. At Agate Cove on the south end of the park, waves crashing against the basalt rocks provide spectacular spouts from blow holes.

Yachats State Recreation Area is a day use only park located on the north side of the mouth of the Yachats River. It includes a viewing deck jutting out from the headlands west of downtown Yachats. It offers viewing of whales and other wildlife, tide pools, kite flying, fishing, and picnicking. Restrooms are available.

Smelt Sands State Recreation Site is a beach located on the northern edge of Yachats. At one time large numbers of smelt (a small relative of the salmon) came ashore here during annual runs. These runs have diminished in recent years. The beach can be reached by walking the historic 804 Trail, each way, from the parking area to the south end of the park. In January 2013, the Coastal Safety Marker was installed in Smelt Sands State Park to remind visitors about the danger of sneaker waves. The marker tells the story of two high school seniors from Eugene, Oregon, who were hit by a sneaker wave and drowned here on February 5, 2011.
Yachats Community Park is a restored marshland in the city&#x27;s center. The park&#x27;s boardwalks and paths present a wide variety of native plants and wildlife, including a preserved spruce forest. Migrating waterfowl visit the wetlands regularly, and ospreys nest on platforms provided especially for them. The park includes a picnic shelter, peace garden, tree house, and benches.

Gerdemann Botanical Preserve is a native woodland on the northern edge of Yachats and the western edge of the Siuslaw National Forest. The garden contains and preserves the botanical collection of horticulturalists James and Janice Gerdemann. Among the native Sitka spruce, western hemlock and wildflowers, the garden is a unique experimental outdoor laboratory, featuring a great many exotic species such as South African honeybush, New Zealand and Tasmanian tree ferns, Chinese fig hazel, Australian Grevillia, and Chilean flame and lantern trees. Today the garden is dedicated to botanical research and education.

Ten Mile Creek Sanctuary is a reserve south of Yachats. This protected stand of Sitka spruce and western hemlock is home to the federally listed species of marbled murrelet and northern spotted owl as well as other species such as the Roosevelt elk, black-tailed deer, cougar, black bear, and bald eagle. Ten Mile Creek has runs of steelhead trout, Chinook salmon, and threatened coho salmon. The sanctuary is under the management of the Audubon Society, and offers extensive educational programs in addition to its conservation efforts.

==Government==
Yachats has a council–manager form of government, including a mayor and four councilors. The positions are non-partisan and unpaid; the mayor serves a two-year term and the councilors serve four-year terms. The city has four commissions: The Planning Commission, The Public Works and Streets Commission, The Library Commission, and The Parks and Commons Commission.

==Education==
Yachats is served by the Lincoln County School District. Kindergarten through eighth grade students attend Crestview Heights School in Waldport, and ninth through twelfth grade students attend Waldport High School. The closest colleges are Oregon Coast Community College in Newport (with a branch in Waldport) and Lane Community College in Florence.

==Media==
Published monthly, &quot;The Yachats Gazette&quot; provides hardcopy and online community news, including interviews and features about local people, businesses and attractions. Two other publications cover the Yachats area: the &quot;South Lincoln County News&quot; and the &quot;Newport News-Times&quot;. No radio or television stations are located in the Yachats area.

==Infrastructure==
Yachats is on U.S. Route 101. Renovation of Highway 101 shoulders in 2017 has caused some problems, and due to pedestrian ability to stop traffic at will some local residents have dubbed Yachats &quot;the biggest little traffic jam on the Oregon coast.&quot; The closest airport is Wakonda Beach State Airport R33, a grass airstrip near Waldport. Yachats has no rail service, but local bus transportation is provided by Lincoln County Transit.

The City of Yachats provides water and sewer services. Drinking water comes from Salmon and Reedy creeks. Electricity is provided by Central Lincoln Public Utility District and telephone service by Pioneer Telephone Cooperative. Solid waste disposal and cable are provided by private businesses.

The closest hospitals are Samaritan Pacific Communities Hospital in Newport and Peace Harbor Hospital in Florence. Health care is available in Waldport at Waldport Family Medical Center, Samaritan (Waldport) Clinic, and Waldport Physical Therapy and Sports Medicine.

Yachats Rural Fire District has three fire stations. Law enforcement is provided by the Lincoln County Sheriff&#x27;s Department and the Oregon State Police.

<text>Brownsville is a city in Linn County, Oregon, United States. As of the 2020 census the population was 1,694.

==History==
===Establishment===

Brownsville was originally known as &quot;Calapooya&quot; after the area&#x27;s original inhabitants, the Kalapuya Native People, or &quot;Kirk&#x27;s Ferry&quot;, after the ferry operated across the Calapooia River by early settlers Alexander and Sarah Kirk. When Linn County was created from the southern portion of Champoeg County on December 28, 1847, the Provisional Legislature named Calapooia as the county seat. The Spaulding School in Brownsville served as the original county courthouse. Brownsville was named in honor of Hugh L. Brown, who settled there in 1846 and opened the first store.

In 1851, the Territorial Legislature passed an act establishing Albany as the county seat. A special election in 1856 reaffirmed Albany as the county seat.

===&quot;Stand by Me&quot;===

In the mid-1980s, Brownsville assumed a of international renown as the location for the film &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, directed by Rob Reiner. The film was shot in and around the community in June and July 1985, with theatrical release in August 1986. About 100 local residents were used as extras in the film, and the event was memorialized in 2007 with the first community celebration of Stand by Me Day on July 23 of that year. The date for Stand by Me Day was chosen by local resident and expert on the film Linda McCormick, who recalled in a 2016 interview that the day had been picked as one that did not interfere with other regional events and &quot;wasn&#x27;t too close to the start of the school year.&quot; About 2,000 visitors made the pilgrimage to Brownsville for the 2007 event. The celebration has been held annually since that year, with the exception of 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2016 iteration, honoring the 30th anniversary of the cinematic release, introduced the first &quot;Ray Brower Memorial 5K Walk/Run,&quot; named in honor of the dead body around which the film&#x27;s plot revolved.

<text>Halsey is a city in Linn County, Oregon, United States. The population was 904 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The city was founded in 1872, and legally incorporated by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on October 20, 1876. The city takes its name from William L. Halsey, who was at the time vice-president of Oregon &amp; California Railroad.

On July 31, 1903 most of the city&#x27;s downtown core burned to the ground, after a fire started at the J. L. Bishur Creamery.

The city&#x27;s iconic grain elevator was built in 1955 and stood at a height of 180 feet. It was partially demolished in December 2012 over concerns of structural integrity.

In 2022, the most powerful handgun cartridge in the world, the .500 Bushwhacker, was developed and introduced by Halsey residents James Tow and Keith Tow.

Lebanon is served by the Lebanon Community Schools public school district, which includes Lebanon High School. It is also home to the private East Linn Christian Academy, which serves students from preschool through twelfth grade (PreK-12).

Western University of Health Sciences opened their College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific, Northwest in August 2011, the first new medical school in Oregon since Oregon Health &amp; Science University was established. The school opened with 107 students.

In 2017, Linn-Benton Community College opened its HealthCare Occupations Center beside the osteopathic college.

In 2021, Western University of Health Sciences opened its College of Health Sciences for students of physical therapy.

==History==
In 1847, Jeremiah and Jemima Ralston bought a pioneers&#x27; cabin, staked a claim, and built a log house on a low rise at what is now Ralston Park. Nearby, on today&#x27;s Main Street, they built a store. It soon became a stop for gold seekers on their way to California. A village grew up around the store, and in 1855 the couple filed a plat for the town, naming it for Jeremiah&#x27;s birthplace of Lebanon, Tennessee. They also donated land for the Santiam Academy, which the Methodist Episcopal Church operated until 1906.

Lebanon was established on the land of the Louis Band of the Santiam Kalapuya. Like other Kalapuya tribes, the Santiam had dwindled in number, from malaria and other diseases, before the Americans arrived. In 1855, the band sold the U.S. government their rights to the land and moved to a temporary reservation on a claim belonging to the Ralstons&#x27; son, just south of their own. There the band awaited removal to the Grand Ronde Valley.

In 1859, local men in search of a way to drive cattle to central Oregon discovered the Santiam Pass. Soon Lebanon found itself on another essential trade route. Linn County stockmen incorporated the Willamette Valley and Cascade Mountain Road in 1864, and vacationers as well as stockmen came to rely on what came to be called the Santiam Wagon Road. This toll road was later replaced with U.S. Highway 20.

Transportation was often easier by water than land in the early decades of American settlement in the Willamette Valley. The South Santiam River was too shallow for large boats, so in 1872 construction began on a canal to carry barges laden with goods between Lebanon and Albany. But the water flowed too fast for upstream shipping, and the coming of the railroad curtailed downstream shipping. Today, however, the canal is still in use, running through Lebanon backyards to provide water for the people of Albany.

Railroads helped Lebanon provide its goods not only to Albany but to the world. The Albany–Lebanon Railroad, completed in 1880, was a branch of the Oregon and California Railroad&#x27;s north–south line through Albany. The Southern Pacific eventually took over these lines and, in 1910, rerouted the old Oregonian line through Lebanon.

From the 1890s on, a great variety of farming and food-processing industries flourished in the area. Eastern Oregon came to dominate in wheat growing, but Lebanon-area farmers produced orchard fruits, berries, walnuts, filberts, hops, flax, vegetables, forage crops, turkeys, mohair, honey, and flowers for florists. Lebanon had a cheese factory, a creamery, potato warehouses, a cannery, and prune and nut driers. In the 1920s, the local grass-seed industry got its start, and by the 1930s Linn County was the leading county in grass-seed production in the United States.

Lebanon&#x27;s most celebrated crop has been strawberries. By 1907, Lebanon was one of the leading strawberry-growing areas in the Willamette Valley. Lebanon&#x27;s Strawberry Festival – featuring, since 1931, &quot;the World&#x27;s Largest Strawberry Shortcake&quot; – has been an annual event since 1909. As of 2020, however, only one local strawberry field remains.

The local wood-products industry began to grow around 1900, which the supply of timber in the upper Midwest declined. The industry began to boom when the Oregon and Electric Railroad was completed, in 1932. New sawmills were built along the line in town as well as in the mountains. From 1937 to 1942, twenty new mills opened in the city; they made a great variety of wood products. The paper mill, which had originally made paper from wheat straw, doubled in size in 1936 to process logs that were floated down the South Santiam River. The local population swelled, and the Great Depression had little effect on the city.

In 1940, a still greater boom began. That year, Evans Products built what was purported to be the biggest plywood mill in the world. &quot;Evansville&quot; became a station on the Oregon and Electric line. World War II increased the demand for plywood, and women took men&#x27;s places in the mill. From 1940 to 1950, Lebanon&#x27;s population grew by 115 percent.

In 1952, the plywood plant, now called Cascade Plywood, began producing Lebanite, a hard composite board. Lebanon residents began calling themselves Lebanites. Cascade Plywood came to dominate Lebanon&#x27;s economy.

Lebanon&#x27;s economy began a slow decline in the 1970s. As overharvesting in the nearby forests made timber extraction more expensive, the mills began closing. Lebanon&#x27;s paper mill closed in 1980, the plywood mill in 1984, and the Lebanite hardwood plant in 2004. Weyerhaeuser shut down the last of the big mills in 2006 and 2007. Unemployment rocketed, and Main Street storefronts were left empty.

In the twenty-first century, the city&#x27;s economy has improved. The openings of the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific Northwest, in 2011, the Edward C. Allworth Veterans&#x27; Home, in 2017, and Linn-Benton Community College&#x27;s HealthCare Occupations Center, in 2017, have sparked growth. Weyerhaeuser opened the state-of-the-art Santiam Lumber sawmill in 2008, only one year after closing down the old Bauman sawmill. Main Street storefronts and old houses are being renovated, and brewpubs, bakeries, and other new businesses are thriving.

==Arts and culture==
===Annual cultural events===
Lebanon is the home of the World&#x27;s Largest Strawberry Shortcake, a part of the annual Strawberry Festival that began in 1909. The Strawberry Festival includes a Junior Parade, a Grand Parade (featuring the Strawberry Royalty Court), and a carnival. It is held the first weekend of June.

==Recreation==
===Parks===
The city has 15 developed parks, totaling , which provide residents with baseball, softball, and soccer fields, as well as playgrounds, basketball and tennis courts, and other resources. Gills Landing has a boat ramp and dock, as well as an RV park, camping area, and showers. Ralston Park hosts the town&#x27;s Christmas tree and yearly lighting celebration.

===Trails===
A local nonprofit organization, Build Lebanon Trails, is working with the city government to build more than of walking and biking trails in Lebanon.

<text>Millersburg is a city in Linn County, Oregon, United States. It was originally the name of a station on the Southern Pacific railroad line, which was named for a local farming family. The population was 1,329 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
Millersburg came into being in 1974, to prevent the city of Albany from attempting to extend its city limits to include where Wah Chang Corporation operated a zirconium processing plant for the United States Bureau of Mines.

Although now owned by Allegheny Technologies and until recently known as ATI Wah Chang, this processing plant is the city&#x27;s largest employer.

Millersburg&#x27;s infamous stench of past years, often attributed to the Wah Chang facility, is actually generated by the nearby Weyerhaeuser wood products processing mill. This has lent support to various attempts to close both plants. In August 2008, Weyerhauser sold the mill to International Paper. International Paper then closed the mill at the end of 2009, laying off 270 employees. As of summer 2010, the mill sits idle.

On July 22, 2010, the demolition of the paper mill, now owned by International Paper, began with the implosion of the number 4 recovery boiler.

In 2008, Peak Sun Silicon built a polysilicon production facility in Millersburg. They currently employ about 50 people with plans to expand up to 500 jobs by 2013. However Peak Sun Silicon&#x27;s land in Oregon was foreclosed on after they were unable to repay a loan from the Oregon Department of Energy.

Moore was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of four counts of murder. In September 2008, the Animal Liberation Front released 215 minks from the S&amp;N Fur Farm, with 177 later captured by the ranch. A flood in January 2012 caused significant property damage in Scio and the surrounding area.

<text>Sweet Home is a city in Linn County, Oregon, United States, with a population of 9,828 at the 2020 census. Sweet Home is referred to as the &#x27;Gateway to the Santiam Playground&#x27; due to its proximity to nearby lakes, rivers and the Cascade Mountains.

== History ==
Settlers first arrived in the Sweet Home Valley in the early 1850s. A community known as Buckhead developed near the mouth of Ames Creek and the South Santiam River. Buckhead was named after a saloon that featured a set of elk antlers on the gable end of its building. East of Buckhead, a community called Mossville developed with a store and post office. In 1874, the two communities merged to become one community called Sweet Home. In 1893, the city of Sweet Home was incorporated.

The Santiam Wagon Road, a toll road connecting the Willamette Valley with central Oregon, was opened in 1865. The road extended from the Sweet Home Valley across the Santiam Pass in the Cascades to Camp Polk near Sisters. The Santiam Wagon Road was a vital means of supplying livestock and goods from western Oregon to central Oregon and transporting wool from east of the Cascades back to Willamette Valley woolen mills. Competition with railroads that extended south from the Columbia River into central Oregon and the newly opened McKenzie Pass Highway made the wagon road obsolete by the late 1930s. U.S. Route 20 was constructed across much of the same route as the Santiam Wagon Road.

Sweet Home experienced significant growth during the 1940s due to the demand for timber from local forests. Further growth occurred when construction began on nearby Green Peter Dam in 1962 and continued as construction began on Foster Dam in 1966.

During the 1980s, Sweet Home experienced a number of sawmill and plywood mill closures due to economic cycles, increased competition, increased productivity, and logging restrictions placed on nearby forests resulting from environmental concerns for endangered species. In response, community members sought out other economic development opportunities such as the Oregon Jamboree country music and camping festival.

Sweet Home is built on a prehistoric petrified forest. In addition to fossil wood, the area includes a variety of agate, jasper, crystals and minerals.

<text>Jordan Valley is a city in Malheur County, Oregon, United States. It is part of the Ontario, OR–ID Micropolitan Statistical Area. The city lies along Jordan Creek, a tributary of the Owyhee River; the creek is named for a 19th-century prospector, Michael M. Jordan. The population was 130 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
===Indigenous peoples===
Northern Paiute people were the first in the area, frequenting nearby mountains and streambeds to find or follow food sources. When early settlers arrived, conflict developed over local resources, eventually escalating to the Snake War. The conflict lasted from 1864 to 1868 and left two thirds of the Paiutes dead. The surviving Paiutes were sent to a reservation.

===Early settlement===
Non-native settlement in the area was largely driven by the 1863 discovery of gold along Jordan Creek by a group of prospectors camping in the area. Soon after, the area was named Jordan Valley after Michael M. Jordan, one of the men in the group. Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, the son of Sacagawea, was among the early miners who came to the area.

Another miner named Silas Skinner organized a small team and built a road to more easily access Jordan Creek. The road passed through the current-day location of Jordan Valley, which soon became a pack station where miners would wait for snow to melt enough to access the mining area. The town also served as a rest stop for those travelling between larger mining towns such as Silver City, Ruby City, and De Lamar. A post office opened in 1867 in the cabin of John Baxter, one of the first permanent residents of Jordan Valley. Skinner operated his toll road until 1878, when the Owyhee County Commissioners took over responsibility for all roads in the area. He then settled in Jordan Valley and opened the Skinner Ranch.

===Economic transition===
When mining declined in the area and populations of boomtowns like Silver City dwindled around 1875, residents of Jordan Valley survived by transitioning to ranching. By 1867, 11 ranches were operating locally. In 1888, there were an estimated 100,000 head of cattle in the area. Ranching supported continuing growth of the community until the Great Depression struck in 1929. This financial hardship, coupled with the remoteness of the town (and subsequent lack of law enforcement) made bootlegging grow in popularity during the last few years of Prohibition.

===Basque immigration===
Many Basque immigrants came to Jordan Valley, starting around 1889 with the arrival of José Navarro and Antone Azcuenaga. Local oral history claims that before long, the Basques comprised around two thirds of the population of the town. A pelota court, known as the Pelota Fronton, was built in 1915, and still stands as a historic landmark. The Basques also constructed several sandstone buildings, including three boarding houses, and (with the help of local Irish immigrants) the St. Bernard&#x27;s Catholic Church, which can still be seen today. Basque immigration to the area slowed with the passing of the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934, which favored cattle ranching over sheep, the Basques&#x27; preferred livestock. To this day, a majority of the town&#x27;s population identify as being of Basque Heritage.

===Declining population===
Jordan Valley&#x27;s population steadily dwindled after the 1920s, with the only notable growth being correlated with the 1977 opening of the DeLamar Mine, and its reopening by the Kinross Gold Corporation in 1993, when the population grew from 376 to 446. The mine closed in 1999, and by 2016, the population of Jordan Valley had dwindled to around 175. In 2017, Integra Resources Corporation purchased the mine, but as of 2019, is still in the process of researching and planning future silver mining operations for the site.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Jordan Valley&#x27;s most prominent geographical landmark is the blunt plateau across Jordan Creek and adjacent to town, Pharmacy Hill.

Jordan Valley&#x27;s main occupations are cattle ranching and sheep herding. People in those occupations typically live far from town on homesteads, but use Jordan Valley as their cultural and economic center. People within Jordan Valley primarily provide a number of services to tourists passing through on U.S. Route 95, which is the primary road from Boise, Idaho to Reno, Nevada.

Jordan Valley is known for its excellent hunting and fishing as well as its proximity to Jordan Craters, an extinct volcanic field. Other popular areas nearby include Leslie Gulch, Cow Lakes, Antelope Reservoir, and Three Forks to the south.

<text>Nyssa ( ) is a city in Malheur County, Oregon, United States. The population was 3,267 at the 2010 census. The city is located along the Snake River on the Idaho border, in the region of far eastern Oregon known as the &quot;Treasure Valley&quot;. It is part of the Ontario, OR–ID Micropolitan Statistical Area.

The primary industry in the region is agriculture, including the cultivation of Russet potatoes, sugar beets, onions, corn, flower seed, mint, and wheat. The city&#x27;s economy relies on the surrounding agricultural area with its several large onion and potato packaging plants.

==History==
The area surrounding the city was originally inhabited by Native Americans. Northern Paiute and Cayuse frequented the area but had difficulty living in the relatively harsh climate. The original Fort Boise, established in the 1830s, is nearby to the southeast. The city was originally a shipping center for sheep and stock on the Union Pacific&#x27;s main trunk line.

Experiments with growing sugar beets were begun in 1935 by R. H. Tallman, the Idaho district manager of the Amalgamated Sugar Company. Successful yields led to the first Amalgamated-designed and built factory, which began operation on October 9, 1938. The factory was located at , on both the Union Pacific Railroad lines and along U.S. Route 20.

In 1942, during World War II, Japanese Americans who had been removed from their West Coast homes worked in a farm labor camp outside Nyssa. Most of these internees came from the Portland Assembly Center and had volunteered to work in the Farm Security Administration camp to avoid incarceration. The camp consisted of approximately 100 canvas tents, each containing a wood stove and a bare light bulb, as well as laundry and bathroom facilities and one public tent used for meetings, dances and church services. Although the facilities were not fenced in and the laborers were trucked into Nyssa once a week for recreation and shopping, Japanese Americans were subject to a curfew and were not permitted to leave the camp without an escort. A total of some 400 men, women and children worked in the Nyssa camp, with a peak population of about 350. In November 1942, the tents being insufficient to keep out the winter cold, the camp was closed and most of the laborers moved to other FSA camps or private farms, or found employment and remained in Eastern Oregon (outside of the &quot;exclusion zone&quot; from which Japanese Americans were denied entry).

Near the end of the war, a branch camp for German and Italian prisoners of war from Camp Rupert, near Buhl, Idaho, was established. Those POWs helped with the sugar beet industry, typically through thinning and harvesting.

From 1936 until 2005, the Amalgamated Sugar Company (White Satin brand) owned and operated a sugar-processing plant that served as the city&#x27;s main source of commerce. The closing of the plant resulted in the loss of 600 seasonal jobs. The Nyssa plant just a few years previously had produced more sugar than anywhere else for Amalgamated Sugar. To date the plant has been stripped of everything except the brown sugar line. The mechanic shop is still running. Beets are shipped to Nampa, Idaho. Nyssa also had a greenhouse and testing facilities which were later moved to Twin Falls.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Nyssa has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Green Party Taiwan is a political party in Taiwan established on 25 January 1996. Although the party is sympathetic to Taiwanese nationalism and shares a number of centre-left positions with the Pan-Green Coalition, the party emphasizes campaigning primarily on social and environmental issues. The party is not a member of, and should not be confused with, the Pan-Green Coalition. Green Party Taiwan is a member of the Asia Pacific Greens Federation and participates in the Global Greens.

Much of the 400-strong membership are affiliated with the non-governmental organisation sector of Taiwanese society, as well as from academia and the youth community.

==Electoral history==
In 1996, Green Party Taiwan’s Kao Meng-ting was elected to the National Assembly. However, he left the party in 1997.

In the 2008 legislative election, the Green Party of Taiwan formed a red-green coalition with a labour-led organization Raging Citizens Act Now! (人民火大行動聯盟), but failed to win any seats.

In the 2012 legislative election, Green Party Taiwan garnered 1.7% of the party vote. While still far short of the 5% threshold to win a seat in the legislature, this makes it the largest extraparliamentary party in Taiwan. Its best showing is in Orchid Island, where Taiwan’s nuclear waste storage facility is located. There, the party collected 35.76% of the party votes due to its strong anti-nuclear stance.

In the 2014 local elections, the party won two seats. Wang Hao-yu was elected to the Taoyuan City Council, and Jay Chou was elected to the Hsinchu County Council.

In the 2016 general election, the party ran in a coalition with the newly founded centre-left Social Democratic Party and fielded candidates in both constituency races and the nationwide party ballot. The coalition garnered 2.5% of the party vote without winning any seats.

In the 2020 legislative election, the Green Party nominated five young professionals, including famed psychologist Cheng Hui-wen and party founder Kao Cheng-yan. They got 2.4% of the votes and did not win any seats. They were the second largest party that didn’t win a seat.

In the 2022 local election, the party won only one seat. was elected to the Hsinchu City Council.

The Green Party nominated Taiwan&#x27;s first transgender legislative candidate, Abbygail ET Wu (吳伊婷), in the 2024 election cycle. The party won 117,298 votes (0.85%), not enough to seat any candidate named on the Green Party list.

On March 30, 2024, Liu Chong-hsian resigned from the party. This leaves the party with no members holding public office.

The Green Party averages around 3% of total votes cast in metropolitan urban areas, with support in rural areas, such as Orchid Island, as high as 35.8%.
