<text>Gage is a town in Ellis County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 433 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Located in the central part of Ellis County on SH-46, thirteen miles north of the county seat, Arnett, and on SH-15, twenty-one miles southwest of Woodward, Gage developed primarily because of transportation access. The military road from Fort Supply to Fort Elliott/Mobeetie, Texas, passed near the future town, and two miles to the northwest a stage stop existed at the confluence of Little Wolf Creek and Wolf Creek. In 1887 the Southern Kansas Railway (later part of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway) had constructed a line across northwestern Oklahoma from Kansas to the Texas Panhandle. A station called Gage, named for Chicago railroad financier Lyman J. Gage, was established in July near Wolf Creek. Once the domain of various Plains Indian groups, by that time this region had become part of the Cherokee Outlet, opened to settlement by a land run in September 1893.

After that, Woodward County included the site of future Gage. A year after the run several settlers, including John Barr and Frederick D. Webster, took up land near the railroad stop. A post office was designated in February 1895, with Webster as postmaster. By 1898 the community was big enough to support a half dozen stores, a hotel, and a sawmill. In 1901 activity surrounding the opening of the Kiowa-Comanche-Apache lands, to the south, attracted new people to the town and farmers to purchase land nearby. The town&#x27;s residents voted to incorporate a six-block area in May 1904. Eighteen months later, anti-liquor campaigner and Guthrie resident Carrie Nation, on one of her lecture tours through Oklahoma Territory, made a brief visit to Gage&#x27;s saloons and met a cold reception. In 1907, when Ellis County was created, taking in this part of Woodward County, Gage&#x27;s 1907 population stood at 755 and in 1910 at 924, the all-time peak.

The growing community served as a cattle and grain shipping point for the surrounding area. Prosperity in the first decade after incorporation attracted two banks, five lumberyards, and more than two dozen retail establishments. Two cotton gins, a roller mill, and three elevators served farmers. The Brennecke Metal Manufacturing Company made water and stock tanks. A theater and the Wolf Valley Cornet Band provided entertainment. Travelers patronized three hotels and five restaurants. Residents could attend any one of three churches, and children attended a large school building.

Like most rural centers, Gage suffered a decline in the World War I years, but the ideally located railroad town remained viable, as it was some distance from towns of any size. Newspapers serving the residents have included the Ellis County Advocate, the Ellis County Republican, the Gage Banner, and the Gage Record, with the latter continuing in existence at the end of the twentieth century. In 1920 the town had 804 inhabitants

Because of the flat terrain and good weather, the U.S. Army maintained a 720-acre bomber-pilot training field outside Gage during World War II. In the 1940s and 1950s Gage supported two dozen retail stores, gasoline stations, and other commercial establishments. The 1940 census recorded 684 inhabitants, and the 1960 census, 482.

After paved highways allowed commuting to jobs in Woodward and Shattuck, Gage&#x27;s population rose to 536 and 667 in 1970 and 1980, respectively. The Bank of Gage, a turn-of-the-century two-story brick building on Main Street, is on the National Register of Historic Places in Ellis County, Oklahoma. Ranching and farming are still the community&#x27;s economic mainstay. Gage Airport is still operating, based around the former military runways. In 1904 the National Weather Service established a regional climate station at Gage, and the station served the Civil Aviation Authority/FAA at Gage Airport from 1939. The FAA portion of the facility moved to McAlester in the 1990s, but the weather service maintained an unmanned station at the Gage location, which by 2004 had been gathering weather data for a century. After declining to 473 in 1990, Gage finished the twentieth century with a population of 429.
Gage Public Schools consolidated with Fargo Public Schools in the summer of 2016. The issue was hotly debated, with many parents still opting to take their children to the town of Shattuck due to the closer distance and more educational offerings. The local rivalry between &quot;Tiger&quot; and &quot;Bearcat&quot; residents still exists today.

==Geography==
Gage is located on the southern bank of Wolf Creek, an intermittent spring-fed tributary of the Beaver River (also known as the North Canadian River). Wolf Creek extends through Ochiltree and Lipscomb counties of the Texas Panhandle and through Ellis and Woodward counties in Oklahoma. The stream generally runs from the southwest to the northeast and thereby defines the primary orientation of the BNSF Railway and Oklahoma State Highway 15, both of which run through Gage and stretch from Shattuck to Woodward.

===Artesian Beach Park===
Gage is home to Artesian Beach Park (locally known as Gage Beach) (). This park contains a clear, spring-fed or artesian lake approximately the size of five football fields and it hosts what is claimed to be Oklahoma&#x27;s largest outdoor swimming pool. The natural swimming area has cement sides like a pool and a sandy, lake-like bottom. The water depth ranges from and the natural pool is home to a few fish. The artesian lake is said to have formed in 1917 when petroleum exploration first came to the area. When an oil well drilled on the C. J. Minton farm produced only artesian water, the landowner created a swimming and boating area for the public. The city acquired Gage Beach in 1939 and constructed a bathhouse and boat dock and considerable work was done in 2012 to rebuild the banks of Gage Beach. There was once a motel on the springs and travelers came from afar to relax and swim in the spring waters. The water is not drinkable nor is it suitable for irrigation due to high mineral content. Early advertisements touted the water as good for kidney ailments, rheumatism, eczema, and stomach problems and people traveled from Kansas, Texas, and from various parts of Oklahoma to try the pool so full of minerals one can easily float. Originally the artesian spring discharged . Measurements in 2009 suggest that the spring discharge had reduced to only . More recently, the output of the spring has possibly increased and currently the spring-fed lake is fuller than it has been in recent years.

The Enid and Tonkawa Railway (later sold to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway) built though the area in 1899 during construction of its line from North Enid to Billings. So, when the Blackwell, Enid and Southwestern Railroad (later the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway) also built a branch through the area in the 1900-1901 timeframe from Blackwell through Hunter and Enid to the town of Darrow, the two railroads intersected at Breckinridge&#x27;s location. The Frisco Town Company platted the locale in March 1901, and named it for Breckinridge Jones, who was president of the Mississippi Valley Trust Company of St. Louis, Missouri and a major railroad investor. The post office originally used the &quot;Breckenridge&quot; spelling, but two months later changed over to the &quot;Breckinridge&quot; spelling.

The town&#x27;s population fell as low as 42 in the 1960 Census, and the post office closed on November 22, 1963. However, the town rebounded after a large ammonium nitrate fertilizer plant was constructed east of Enid in the 1970&#x27;s.

<doc id="130198" wikidata="Q984361" url="?curid=130198" title="Enid, Oklahoma">
<text>Enid ( ) is the ninth-largest city in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. It is the county seat of Garfield County. As of the 2020 census, the population was 51,308. Enid was founded during the opening of the Cherokee Outlet in the Land Run of 1893, and is named after Enid, a character in Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;. In 1991, the Oklahoma state legislature designated Enid the &quot;purple martin capital of Oklahoma.&quot; Enid holds the nickname of &quot;Queen Wheat City&quot; and &quot;Wheat Capital&quot; of Oklahoma and the United States for its immense grain storage capacity, and has the third-largest grain storage capacity in the world.

==History==
Prior to the Land Run of 1893, the land where present day Enid, Oklahoma sits was part of O County in the Cherokee Outlet, and was occupied by the Cherokee people following the Treaty of New Echota and the Cherokee trail of tears. Historically, the area was a hunting ground for the Wichita, Osage, and Kiowa tribes. The Chisholm Trail, stage coach lines, mail routes, and railroads passed through stations in the town which was then known as Skeleton. In summer 1889, M.A. Low, a Rock Island official, visited the local railroad station then under construction, and inquired about its name. Disliking the original name, he renamed the station Enid, after a character in Alfred Lord Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;. However, a more fanciful story of how the town received its name is popular. According to that tale, in the days following the land run, some enterprising settlers decided to set up a chuckwagon and cook for their fellow pioneers, hanging a sign that read &quot;DINE&quot;. Some other, more free-spirited settlers, turned that sign backward to read, of course, &quot;ENID&quot;. The name stuck.

During the opening of the Cherokee Outlet in the Land Run of 1893, Enid was the location of a land office which is now preserved in its Humphrey Heritage Village, part of the Cherokee Strip Regional Heritage Center. Enid, the rail station, (now North Enid, Oklahoma) was the original town site endorsed by the government. It was platted by the surveyor W. D. Twichell, then of Amarillo, Texas.
The Enid-Pond Creek Railroad War ensued when the Department of the Interior moved the government site south of the station prior to the land run, which was then called South Enid. During the run, due to the Rock Island&#x27;s refusal to stop, people leaped from the trains to stake their claim in the government-endorsed site. By the afternoon of the run, Enid&#x27;s population was estimated at 12,000 people located in the Enid&#x27;s town plat. Enid&#x27;s original plat in 1893 was 6 blocks wide by 11 blocks long consisting of the town square on the northwest end, West Hill (Jefferson) school on the southwest end, Government Springs Park in the middle southern section, and East Hill (Garfield) school on the far northeast corner. A year later, the population was estimated at 4,410, growing to 10,087 by 1907, the year of Oklahoma statehood.

The town&#x27;s early history was captured in &quot;Cherokee Strip: A Tale of an Oklahoma Boyhood&quot; by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Marquis James, who recounts his boyhood in Enid.

He writes of the early town:

Enid experienced a &quot;golden age&quot; following the discovery of oil in the region in the 1910s and continuing until World War II. Enid&#x27;s economy boomed as a result of the growing oil, wheat, and rail industries, and its population grew steadily throughout the early 20th century in conjunction with a period of substantial architectural development and land expansion. Enid&#x27;s downtown had the construction of several buildings including the Broadway Tower, Garfield County Courthouse, and Enid Masonic Temple. In conjunction with the oil boom, oilmen such as T. T. Eason, H. H. Champlin, and Charles E. Knox built homes in the area. Residential additions during this period include Kenwood, Waverley, Weatherly, East Hill, Kinser Heights, Buena Vista, and McKinley. Union Equity, Continental, Pillsbury, General Mills, and other grain companies operated mills and grain elevators in the area, creating what is now the Enid Terminal Grain Elevators Historic District, and earning Enid the titles of &quot;Wheat Capital of Oklahoma&quot;, &quot;Queen Wheat City of Oklahoma,&quot; and &quot;Wheat Capital of the United States&quot;

==Geography==

Located in Northwestern Oklahoma, Enid sits at the eastern edge of the Great Plains. It is located north of Oklahoma City. 

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.12%) is water.

===Climate===
Enid&#x27;s weather conditions are characterized by hot summers, cold, often snowy winters, and thunderstorms in the spring, which can produce tornadoes. The greatest one-day precipitation total by an official rain gauge in Oklahoma was in Enid when fell on October 11, 1973. Temperatures can fall below in the winter, and reach above in the summer. The highest recorded temperature was in 1936, and the lowest recorded temperature was in 1905. On average, the warmest month is July, January is the coolest month, and the maximum average precipitation occurs in June.

An ice storm struck Northwest Oklahoma in late January 2002. The storm caused over $100 million of damage, initially leaving some 255,000 residences and businesses without power. A week later, 39,000 Oklahoma residents were still without power. Enid, with its population of 47,000, was entirely without electricity for days. The Oklahoma Association of Electric Cooperatives reported over 31,000 electrical poles were destroyed across the state. The American Red Cross set up a shelter at Northern Oklahoma College.

Some other notable storms in Enid&#x27;s history include:
*March 16, 1965, an F4 tornado away from the city center injured seven people and caused between $50,000 and $500,000 in damages.
*October 11–13, 1973, Oklahoma&#x27;s greatest urban rainfall on record occurred. Known as the &quot;Enid flood&quot;, an intense thunderstorm was centered over Enid with rainfall accumulations between 15 and 20 inches within a area. About fell in three hours. Enid received , forcing residents to cut holes in rooftops to reach safety. Nine people died.
*May 2, 1979, an F4 tornado away from the Enid city center killed one person, injured 25 people and caused between $500,000 and $5,000,000 in damages.
*April 25, 2009, an EF-2 tornado damaged the Chisholm Trail Expo Center. No one was injured or killed.

==Demographics==


As of the 2020 census, 51,308 people resided in the city in 19,428 households. The population density was 693.9 per square mile. The racial makeup of the city was 75.9% White, 15.3% Hispanic or Latino Americans, 2.6% African American, 2.6% Native American, 1.3% Asian, 4.8% Pacific Islander, and 8.2% from two or more races.

The population consists of 25.2% children under the age of 18, 7.0% under the age of 5, and 14.8% 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.55 with 60.5% being owner occupied housing. 49.4% of people in Enid identify as female, 8.3% were foreign born, 13.2% had some form of disability, and 3,365 were veterans.

===Political affiliation===
Enid has been predominantly a Republican stronghold since its days as part of Oklahoma Territory, owing to the influence of settlers from neighboring Kansas. Enid was named one of the top 10 most conservative cities in America in 2021 with over 60% of voters registering as Republicans. Several politicians have called Enid home, including Oklahoma Territory&#x27;s last governor Frank Frantz; U.S. Representative Page Belcher; US Congressman and former Enid mayor, Milton C. Garber; Oklahoma Lieutenant Governor Todd Lamb; U.S. Representative George H. Wilson; and James Yancy Callahan, the only non-Republican territorial congressional delegate. In 2023 Enid elected a former organizer for Identity Evropa who was at the 2017 Charlottesville Unite the Right rally to its city commission, who was recalled and defeated in 2024.

===Religious affiliation===
Of the people in Enid, 61.9% claim affiliation with a religious congregation; 9.4% are Catholic, 39.2% are Protestant, 1.1% are Latter Day Saints and 12.2% are another Christian denomination. By 1987, there were 90 churches of 27 different denominations of Christianity. Downtown Enid boasted the world&#x27;s largest fresh cut Christmas tree in 2021 and 2022, which was placed downtown in time for the annual Enid Lights Up the Plains festival.

Enid&#x27;s Phillips University, although formally affiliated with the Disciples of Christ, was a product of religious collaboration between followers of the Disciples of Christ, Presbyterian Church, and Judaism. Although Phillips University has closed, Enid still has a number of private Christian schools, including St. Paul&#x27;s Lutheran School, Oklahoma Bible Academy, St. Joseph Catholic School, and Emmannuel Christian School.

Enid has two Catholic congregations: St. Francis Xavier, founded in 1893, and St. Gregory, founded in 1971. St. Francis Xavier&#x27;s Bishop Theophile Meerschaert was responsible for founding Calvary Catholic Cemetery in 1898. Enid is home to several Protestant churches. It has four Lutheran congregations: Immanuel, founded in 1899, Trinity, founded in 1901, St. Paul, founded in 1909, and Redeemer, founded in 1934. Enid has several historically Black churches, including St. Stephen African Methodist Episcopal Church, First Missionary Baptist Church, and West Side Church of God in Christ (COGIC). The Southern Heights Ministerial Alliance brings local Black clergy together. Enid has two churches serving its Korean population, the Enid Korean Church of Grace and Peace United Methodist. Iglesia Cristiana El Shaddai, a Disciples of Christ congregation founded in 2001, serves the area Hispanic community. Enid Faith Ways Church is LGBTQ friendly.

Enid also has a small Bahá’í congregation that often meets in congregants&#x27; homes and serves some of Enid&#x27;s Marshallese population.

Historically, between 1925 and 1930 Enid was home to a small Jewish congregation called Emanuel, which met at the Loewen Hotel, founded by Al Loewen, a local merchant who also served on the committee to create Phillips University. Lacking a synagogue building members of the Jewish community have held services at Convention Hall and local Masonic Temples, or by traveling to synagogues in other cities. The Enid Cemetery also has a Jewish section where many of early Enid&#x27;s Jewish merchants are interred, including the founders of Kaufman&#x27;s Style Shop, Herzberg&#x27;s Department Store, Newman Mercantile, and Meibergen and Godschalk, Enid&#x27;s first clothing store. During the Oklahoma territorial era, Enid elected Jewish resident Joseph Meibergen in 1897 as mayor. Enid was home to the Northwest Oklahoma chapter of the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith founded in 1926, the Enid Jewish Women&#x27;s Council met in the 1930s and 1940s, and the Enid Jewish Chautauqua held programs as early as 1910. 

Enid is the home of two Masonic Lodges, the Enid Lodge #80 and the Garfield Lodge #501. The Enid Lodge has many Jewish members.

===Marshallese population===
In 2014 Enid was the city with the fourth largest Marshallese population in the United States.

A push factor from the Marshall Islands was nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll. Missionaries from Phillips University visited the Marshall Islands, and Marshallese students at Phillips were among the first settlers from the island country. There were also significant numbers who worked at food plants from Advance Foods, now Tyson Foods. There were others who worked at Walmart. The Compact of Free Association allowed Marshallese to begin moving to Enid sometime circa 1987. In 2022 there were 2,800 Marshallese in Enid.

Initially Enid&#x27;s Marshallese were younger. By the 21st century many elderly Marshallese came for medical care, and many of them died at younger ages than other elderly people due to health problems stemming from fallout from the nuclear tests and from poor diets; the nuclear tests made traditional Marshallese food inaccessible due to radiation, so U.S. junk food rations became a major element in the Marshallese diet. Additionally, since 1996, Marshallese citizens were unable to get health programs offered by the federal government due to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act changing relevant laws. The Oklahoma government has the ability to allow Marshallese citizens in its state borders to get access to these federal health programs, but it chooses not to do so.

It is common for Marshallese in Enid to frequently change residences. As many Marshallese have not obtained U.S. citizenship, they lack power in governance. Business ownership and management are not common among Marshallese in Enid.

In 2014 there were 381 students in Enid Public Schools who were Marshallese in English language learner programs, and two of the elementary schools had at least 25% of their total students being Marshallese ELL students. The district, in 2017, had two liaisons meant for the Marshallese population. In 2017, 200 of the students at Enid High School were Marshallese, and by 2014 the school had a student club where Marshallese students taught the overall student population about their culture. Longfellow Middle School also had such a club.

The Marshallese United Church of Christ is in Enid.

===African-American population===
The neighborhoods of Southern Heights and East Park are historically Black neighborhoods in Enid. African-Americans have lived in Enid since the time of the September 1893 Land Run. Members of the Black community soon founded two Baptist churches in 1893, Grayson Missionary Baptist Church, and the First Baptist Church. St. Stephen&#x27;s African Methodist Episcopal Church would follow in 1909. In 1996 Enid&#x27;s First Missionary Baptist Church burned down in a fire during a spate of hate crimes across the American South. The community came together and rebuilt the church. The area near Government Springs Park became an area of Black settlement, coalescing beside these nearby institutions of community life. Prominent citizens of the Black community in early Enid included attorney Devotion Banks, Reverend Louis Johnson, Doctor Ollie Penny, Reverend Moses Ireland, and Reverend William Humphrey. Many Black citizens belonged to the Knights of Pythias fraternal organization. 
Booker T. Washington school was founded in 1896 with a brick school house erected in 1901. The school provided elementary through high school education for Black residents. Washington school was joined by Douglas elementary from 1918 to 1920 and George Washington Carver elementary in 1949. Having previously denied access to Black university students, Phillips University changed its policies after the Brown v. Board of Education ruling. In 1947 despite having no Black classmates, students at Phillips formed a chapter of the NAACP. The first instance of integration in Enid’s public school system occurred in June 1955 when two Black high school students, Leonard Harrison and Ralph Ballard, attended summer school at Emerson Junior High. Enid High School accepted its first Black students in the fall semester of 1955. Enid&#x27;s public schools were not fully integrated until 1969 when Enid closed the elementary schools in the Southern Heights neighborhood and children were bussed to other schools. Citing economics and no foreign language education, the Enid School Board closed Booker T. Washington in 1960, and its 43 students were integrated into the wider school system. Despite strides forward in integrating local educational institutions, local restaurants and drug store lunch counters refused service to Black citizens. In 1958 the Black community organized sit-ins and held meetings between the Enid Negro Chamber of Commerce and the Enid Restauranteurs Association, but the effort failed. The restaurant owners used laws against loitering as grounds to notify police. Another sit-in occurred in May 1963 prior to the passage of the Civil Rights Act which integrated restaurants nationwide.

Another historically Black neighborhood nicknamed &quot;Two Street&quot; existed between South Second Street and South Grand Avenue near the Rock Island railroad tracks. The area was considered a Red Light district with gambling halls, saloons, and brothels. Despite statewide alcohol prohibition in Oklahoma, liquor sales were rampant across town. On July 31, 1917 Judge John C. Moore ordered that residents be evicted and the buildings condemned. Enid appointed its first Black policeman, Henry Backstrom, in the 1920s. Mr. Backstrom had previously served as principal of the Washington school for 11 years. Backstrom was acquitted after killing Fred Williams, a Black resident of Two Street, in the line of duty. He continued to serve for six years before studying at Langston University, and returning to the education field. Former Deputy Sheriff Lon Crosslin was injured during a gunfight while attempting to prevent a jewelry store robbery. Crosslin killed the two Black suspects, but the Klan justified collective punishment of the residents in retaliation for Crosslin&#x27;s injury, issuing orders for residents of the Two Street district to leave Garfield County. Local police refused to protect Black residents and ordered them to obey the Klan. On October 26, 1921 a portion of Enid&#x27;s Black population was driven out by the Klan. An estimated 1,000 members of the Klan held a car parade at midnight, and nearly two dozen Black citizens left town. Local Reverend A.G. Smith, Mayor William H. Ryan, former Deputy Sheriff Lon Crosslin, and the &quot;Enid Daily Eagle&quot; editorial staff praised the action. The mayor routinely received death threats for his public support of the action. Some Black residents resisted, returning to town only to met by threats from the Klan. By 1922 at least ten former residents of the neighborhood had moved to the neighborhood by Government Springs Park. The Klan held additional parades through downtown Enid in 1922 and 1924. At least two Black men were tarred and feathered in separate incidents by the Klan in Enid in the 1920s, including Ed Warner and Walter O&#x27;Banion. There were additional reports of Klan activity in Enid in 1979 and 1985. On September 21, 1979 an 18 year old Black Enid High School student and football player named Mitchell Lee Sanford was hung from a tree. While local police ruled it a suicide, the FBI investigated it as a hate crime due to a recent resurgence in local Klan activity.

Enid&#x27;s chapter of the NAACP was founded in 1941 by local educator Lewis J. Umstead who served as its president until 1952. The group organized a freedom rally in 1963. The NAACP has held multiple Oklahoma state conventions in Enid.
Enid has named streets for notable Black citizens, including opera singer Leona Mitchell in 1981 and professional athlete Lydell Carr in 2023. In 1990 Enid named its municipal building for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and in 1991 a monument bearing a quote from his &quot;I have a dream&quot; speech was erected on the property. An annual march is held in Enid honoring Dr. King. In 2020 residents of Enid participated in protests for Black Lives Matter.

In 2023 Ward 1 elected City Commissioner Judson Blevins, a white nationalist organizer with Identity Evropa, who marched at the Unite the Right rally. Local NAACP leader Lanita Norwood is a founding member of the Enid Social Justice Committee which has actively protested against Blevins, and initiated a recall election for April 2024. Blevins was defeated in the recall, replaced by Cheryl Patterson. 

==Economy==

When Enid participated in the City Beautiful movement in the 1920s, Frank Iddings wrote the city song, &quot;Enid, The City Beautiful&quot;. &quot;You&#x27;re right in the center where the best wheat grows and you&#x27;ve got your share of the oil that flows,&quot; his lyrics read. These were the early staples of the Enid economy. Enid&#x27;s economy saw oil booms and agricultural growth in the first half of the 20th century. The Great Depression, however, caused both of these staples to lose value, and many businesses in Enid closed. However, Enid recovered, prospering and growing in population until a second wave of bad economic times hit in the 1980s, when competition with the local mall and economic factors led Enid&#x27;s downtown area to suffer. Since 1994, Enid&#x27;s Main Street program has worked to refurbish historic buildings, boost the local economy, and initiate local events such as first Friday concerts and holiday celebrations on the town square.

===Water Pipeline to Enid from Kaw Lake===

In 2020 the city of Enid began a multi-million dollar project to lay 70 miles of pipeline to transport 10 million gallons of water a day from Kaw Lake to a booster pump station in Enid. The pipeline is expected to provide a water to the city of Enid for the next 40–50 years. The city of Enid received $205 million in funding from the state of Oklahoma on December 15, 2020, as part of its water pipeline project, the city&#x27;s most expensive project ever. On February 28, 2021, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced their approval of a National Environmental Policy Act Environmental Assessment led by the City of Enid and Garver for the Enid Kaw Lake Water Supply Program. The USACE&#x27;s Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) means that the program has taken a significant step toward construction set to begin in the first half of 2021. On June 3, 2021, the project&#x27;s construction manager at-risk announced that construction had officially begun at the lake&#x27;s intake facility in Osage County where work has begun on the vertical intake shaft, which then will micro-tunnel into the lake to gain access. The project&#x27;s design engineering firm also announced that nearly all the necessary land also has been acquired for the 70-mile pipeline with 223 parcels of land accepted of the 230 total land parcels needed for the pipeline portion of the project.

==Arts and culture==
Enid is home to the annual Tri-State Music Festival which was started in 1932 by Russell L. Wiley, who was Phillips University band director from 1928 to 1934. From 1933 to 1936, Edwin Franko Goldman headlined the festival. The festival takes place each spring in Enid.

In the summertime, Enid&#x27;s Gaslight Theatre hosts a production of Shakespeare in the Park, as well as year-round theater productions. The Enid Symphony Orchestra was formed in 1905 and is the oldest symphony in the state, performing year-round in the Enid Symphony Center. Enid&#x27;s Chautauqua in the Park takes place each summer in Government Springs Park, providing five nights of educational performances by scholars portraying prominent historical figures. The Chautauqua program was brought to Enid in 1907 by the Enid Circle Jewish Chautauqua and is now produced by the Greater Enid Arts and Humanities Council.

Enid&#x27;s Cherokee Strip Regional Heritage Center preserves the local history of the Land Run of 1893, Phillips University, and Garfield County. The museum originated as the Museum of the Cherokee Strip in the 1970s, and reopened on April 1, 2011. Enid also commemorates its land run history each September by hosting the Cherokee Strip Days and Parade. The Humphrey Heritage Village next to the museum offers visitors a chance to see the original Enid land office and other historical buildings.

Several private Christian schools representing a variety of denominations are also located in Enid: Bethel Bible Academy, Emmanuel Christian School, Enid Adventist School, Hillsdale Christian School, Saint Joseph Catholic School, and Saint Paul&#x27;s Lutheran School. Enid High School, Chisholm High School, and Oklahoma Bible Academy are the city&#x27;s largest secondary education schools.

Autry Technology Center, one of the CareerTech centers in Oklahoma run by the Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education, serves as the city&#x27;s only vocational education institution. Northern Oklahoma College serves as Enid&#x27;s community college, and Northwestern Oklahoma State University (NWOSU) provides bachelor and graduate-level education. Enid was formerly home to Phillips University, which closed in 1998; its campus is now owned by Northern Oklahoma College. Philips University drew Marshallese to Enid in the 1970s.

The Public Library of Enid and Garfield County, established in 1899, also serves as an educational resource for the community. Enid was once home to a Carnegie library, which opened in 1910. After years of funding shortages, the building was condemned in 1957, and the library&#x27;s current modernist building was opened in 1964.

==Media==

The &quot;Enid News &amp; Eagle&quot; is the city&#x27;s daily newspaper. Historically, the city had 28 newspapers. The &quot;Enid Eagle&quot; began publication on September 22, 1893. The &quot;Enid Daily Wave&quot; (later the &quot;Enid Morning News&quot;) began on December 11, 1893. In February 1923, the papers were combined to form the Enid Publishing Company.

Enid once had two local broadcast television stations. Public-access television station, PEGASYS, was founded in 1986. PEGASYS broadcast on cable channels 11 and 12, and 19. PEGASYS was managed by a non-profit, and aired largely volunteer produced community programming. In 2014 the city of Enid renamed it the Enid Television Network (ETN) and upgraded its broadcast equipment. On December 31, 2019, ETN ceased its cable television broadcasts and transitioned to online streaming.

KXOK-LD, which briefly locally produced programming from Oakwood Mall in the early 2000s, is currently a Retro TV affiliate.

Historically, Enid was home to television station KGEO, an ABC affiliate from July 2, 1954, to 1958 when it moved its transmitter to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The station is now KOCO-TV.

KQOB 96.9 FM broadcasts in a classic hits format. Stations KNID 107.1 FM and KOFM 103.1 FM specialize in country music. KKRD 91.1 FM and K226BR 93.1 FM are devoted to religious content. KCRC 1390 AM broadcast sports games. KGWA 960 AM and KZLS 1640 AM is a talk radio station, and KXLS 95.7 FM plays various musical genres.

INTEGRIS Health Enid Hospital is the oldest hospital in Enid, founded in 1910, and incorporated in 1914 as Enid General Hospital and Training School for Nurses. St. Mary&#x27;s Regional Medical Center, a 245-bed facility with 127 licensed professionals, was established in 1915 as Enid Springs Sanatorium. Both Enid hospitals are affiliated with the Oklahoma Hospital Association, and their CEOs are FACHE certified. Clinics include the Garfield County Health Department, and Veterans Affairs Clinic. Vance Air Force Base Clinic is operated by the 71st Medical Group which consists of the 71st Medical Operations and Support Squadrons.

===Transportation===
The main highways serving the City of Enid are U.S. Highway 81 Van Buren and U.S. Highway 412 Owen K. Garriott. U.S. Highway 64 runs west down Garriott and U.S. Highway 60 runs east. Both of these highways join together with highway 81 in North Enid, Oklahoma. State Highway 45 also runs through North Enid on Carrier Road.

Railroad development in Garfield County began four years prior to the land opening, and Enid became a central hub within the county, with rail systems running in ten directions. Historical railroads included Enid and Tonkawa Railway, Enid and Anadarko Railway, Blackwell, Enid and Southwestern Railway, Enid Central Railway and the Denver, Enid and Gulf Railroad. Enid&#x27;s railroad history is displayed at the Railroad Museum of Oklahoma which is housed in the former Santa Fe railroad Depot. The Rock Island Depot is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Active railroad operations in Enid are Farmrail (FMRC) / Grainbelt Corporation (GNBC), BNSF Railway, and Union Pacific Railroad (UP). In the past Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa (ATSF), Burlington Northern (BN), Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific (CRIP), Missouri-Kansas-Texas (MKT), North Central Oklahoma and Saint Louis San Francisco &quot;Frisco&quot; (SLSF) connected Enid to the rest of Oklahoma by rail. Currently, BNSF has given Site Certification to the Easterly Industrial Park three miles east of the City, meaning the railroad has identified the location as an optimal rail-served site meeting ten economic development criteria, intended to minimize development risks customers may face.

From 1907 to 1929, Enid also had its own streetcar system, operated by Enid City Railway. The street cars were later replaced by buses, following a declaration by the Enid government that made streetcars illegal.
Since 1984, the Transit, operated by Enid Public Transportation, has been in operation, providing on-demand shuttle services. The Transit also offers service to Oklahoma City&#x27;s Will Rogers Airport, Greyhound Bus Service, and Amtrak Train Station.

==Notable people==

Enid&#x27;s Frank Frantz was the seventh and final Oklahoma Territorial Governor. Enid has been home to several successful entrepreneurs from oilman Herbert Champlin to casino owner, Sam Boyd, founder of the Boyd Gaming Corporation. The arts have also flourished among Enid natives, from Native American painter Paladine Roye to Pulitzer Prize winning author Marquis James. Three Oklahoma State Poets Laureate, Betty Lou Shipley, Bess Truitt and Carol Hamilton, grew up in Enid. In 1937 the &quot;Enid Morning News&quot; referred to Don Blanding as the poet laureate of Enid, Oklahoma, and later he was dubbed the Poet Laureate of Hawaii and Honolulu. The local Don Blanding Poetry Society is named after him. Poets Quraysh Ali Lansana, J. Quinn Brisben, Louis Jenkins, and D.L. Lang also once called Enid home.

Actors Richard Erdman, Glenda Farrell, Lynn Herring, and Thad Luckinbill were all born in Enid, as was Emmy Award winning director, Sharron Miller. Many musicians have called Enid home, including violinist Kyle Dillingham, jazz great Sam Rivers, jazz pianist Pat Moran McCoy, folk singer and banjoist Karen Dalton, fingerstyle guitarist Michael Hedges and opera singer Leona Mitchell, with the last two having streets in Enid bearing their names. Mitchell&#x27;s brother, Hulon Mitchell Jr (Yahweh Ben Yahweh) was the founder of the religious group, Nation of Yahweh. Attorney Stephen Jones defended Timothy McVeigh after the Oklahoma City bombing.

A number of military heroes have also come from Enid, including former US Army Special Forces operator
Bo Gritz, Medal of Honor recipient Harold Kiner, and Pearl Harbor hero USAF General Kenneth M. Taylor. Enid has a history of aviation professionals from aviation pioneer Clyde Cessna, founder of the Cessna Aircraft Company, to Irving Woodring, one of the Army&#x27;s Three Musketeers of Aviation. Cessna&#x27;s pioneering flights earned him the nickname the &quot;Birdman of Enid&quot;. One of Enid&#x27;s main streets is named after Astronaut Owen K. Garriott, and Enid&#x27;s air force base is named for Medal of Honor recipient Leon Vance.
Mark Kelly, bass player of the Christian rock band Petra calls Enid home. Former White House photojournalist David Scott Holloway, recipient of the Getty Grant and photographer for &quot;Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown&quot; on CNN was born in Enid, attending Longfellow Jr. High School, before his family moved near Waukomis where he attended Pioneer Pleasantvale High School.

Even some fictional characters hold Enid as their home town, including Paul and Amanda Kirby (portrayed by William Macy and Téa Leoni) in &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;, Maggie Gyllenhaal&#x27;s character, journalist Jean Craddock, in &quot;Crazy Heart&quot;, and in &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, Lucas McCain and his son Mark lived in Enid before settling in North Fork, New Mexico Territory.

Some even claim two figures from the Abraham Lincoln assassination lived and died in Enid. In 1901, Osborn H. Oldroyd wrote &quot;The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln Flight, Pursuit (sic), Capture, and Punishment of the Conspirators&quot; which claimed that Sgt. Boston Corbett, the man who killed John Wilkes Booth in Virginia, resided in Enid, employed as a medicine salesman. Local legend holds that Corbett is buried in one of the unmarked graves in the Enid Cemetery. In 1907, Finis L. Bates wrote &quot;The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth&quot;. The book claimed that David E. George, a tenant at the Grand Avenue Hotel who committed suicide by poison in 1903, was actually John Wilkes Booth. After sitting for years in Penniman&#x27;s Funeral Home, George&#x27;s mummified body later toured the carnival circuit. The 1937 short film &quot;The Man in the Barn&quot; by Jacques Tourneur revisits the story of David E. George as Booth.

<doc id="130207" wikidata="Q1918405" url="?curid=130207" title="Elmore City, Oklahoma">
<text>Elmore City is a town in Garvin County, Oklahoma, United States. This town is south of Oklahoma City. The population was 738 at the time of the 2020 census, up from 697 at the 2010 census. It was named after J. O. Elmore.

There are two main highways running through Elmore City. One of the Highways is Oklahoma State Highway 29, running west–east. The other is Oklahoma State Highway 74, running north–south. It is about west of Wynnewood, south of Purcell, and west of U.S. Highway 177.

== History ==
The first business in Elmore City was opened by Jasper N. Black in an area just northeast of what is now Elmore City. Historians state that after Black opened his supply store in 1890 on Rock Creek, the number of settlers quickly grew and a community was formed called Banner. Banner quickly spread to the southwest and a post office was established and the name changed to Elmore for J. O. Elmore, another prominent business man. The word city was added to Elmore after the name was confused with Elmer in Jackson County. The city was incorporated as a community in 1898.

At the time of its founding, Elmore City was located in Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation.

The film &quot;Footloose&quot; was loosely based on events that took place in the town. Elmore City had a ban, dating from before statehood, on public dancing within town limits. High school students during the 1979-1980 class year began lobbying for the right to hold a school prom with dancing. However, during the first town meeting on the issue, perhaps three-quarters of the crowd was against the idea, led by local church leaders. The controversy was picked up by local newspapers, went national, and ended up as a small item in a San Francisco paper. This was where songwriter/screenwriter Dean Pitchford, who was looking for a movie musical idea, ran across it. The eventual result was the 1984 movie. As to the prom, the town mayor sided with the kids, declaring that a high school function was not a “public” event. The school board then authorized the prom, which proceeded and received national coverage.

<text>Pauls Valley is a city in and the county seat of Garvin County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 5,992 at the 2020 census, a decline of 3.2 percent from the figure of 6,187 in 2010. It was settled by and named for Smith Paul, a North Carolina native who married a Chickasaw woman and became a citizen of the Chickasaw Nation before the Civil War. The town economy is largely based on agriculture and oil production.

==History==
The area that eventually became the city of Pauls Valley was one of the earliest European-American settlements in what was then known as Indian Territory. Smith Paul, born in 1809 in New Bern, North Carolina, discovered the fertile bottom land which is now Pauls Valley while a member of a wagon train traveling to California. Paul described the land as &quot;a section where the bottom land was rich and blue stem grass grew so high that a man on horseback was almost hidden in its foliage.&quot;

The Tri-Party Treaty of January 1, 1837, ceded this part of what is now the State of Oklahoma to the Chickasaw Nation. When the Chickasaw people were relocated to Indian Territory that year, Smith Paul moved with them and married Ela-Teecha, a Chickasaw woman. In 1847, the Pauls established a plantation on the rich Garvin County bottom land, where Rush Creek joined the Washita River, which became known to locals as &quot;Smith Paul&#x27;s Valley&quot;. Mail to the Pauls was often addressed to &quot;Smith Paul&#x27;s Large Farm&quot;. By 1871, postal service was established in the area, although the post office was designated &quot;Paul&#x27;s Valley, Arkansas&quot;, because the Indian Territory was being administered out of Arkansas at that time.

The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (a.k.a. Santa Fe Railway) shortened the name to &quot;Paul&#x27;s Valley&quot; when it built a track through the community in 1887, completing its connection between Kansas and the Gulf Coast. The railroad brought growth and prosperity to Smith Paul&#x27;s Valley. The first newspaper was published in 1887. The Pauls Valley town site was laid out in 1892, though the plat was not approved by the Dawes Commission until 1903.

At the time of its founding, Pauls Valley was located in Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation.

A U.S. courthouse was built in 1895. The first white school in Indian Territory was established, and brick buildings were built downtown. In 1909, the streets were bricked. Today, Pauls Valley has more brick streets——than any other town in the United States.

From 1948–1954, Pauls Valley was home to the Pauls Valley Raiders, a minor league baseball team. The Pauls Valley Raiders were a member of the Class D Sooner State League and an affiliate of the New York Giants (1952–1953). The Pauls Valley Raiders played at Wacker Park.

When the Santa Fe Railway discontinued its Lone Star route in 1979, the 1905 building fell into disuse. By 1985, the railroad had obtained a permit to raze the old depot. Adrienne Grimmet, who was then president of the Pauls Valley Historical Society, started a campaign to save the old structure. Her efforts resulted in the city&#x27;s buying the depot and turning it over to the historical society for conversion into a museum. Individuals donated their time and skills, and local businesses either donated or discounted the cost of materials to perform the necessary renovations, which began in 1991.

In 1999, Amtrak began its &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot; service between Oklahoma City and Fort Worth, passing through Pauls Valley. City officials agreed to build a new waiting room for Amtrak passengers adjacent to the old depot. The new Pauls Valley station has a climate-controlled waiting area and restrooms, but is unstaffed, having no ticketing or baggage handling facilities. It also has a 10-car parking lot outside. The architecture was designed to be compatible with the old Santa Fe-style building.

The Oklahoma Cartoonists Hall of Fame, located in the Toy and Action Figure Museum, was opened in Pauls Valley in 2005.

<text>Wynnewood ( ) is a city in Garvin County, Oklahoma, United States. It is south of Oklahoma City. The population was 1,927 at the time of the 2020 census. Located in what was then the Chickasaw Nation of Indian Territory, it began as a village called &quot;Walner&quot; in 1886, on the proposed route of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway. Railroad workers from Pennsylvania named the community for Wynnewood, a community outside of Philadelphia. The name became official on April 6, 1887.

== History ==
At the time of its founding, Wynnewood was located in Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation.
Wynnewood quickly became a market town for the surrounding area. In 1887, Presbyterian missionary Mary Semple Hotchkins moved her school for Chickasaw children from Cherokee Town to Wynnewood. In 1901, local citizens paid for building Indianola College. A promotional brochure published in 1907 called Wynnewood &quot;the Queen City of the Famous Washita Valley.&quot; It could soon boast of having an opera house, electric lights, telephones, and the thirty-room Eskridge Hotel.

The Eskridge Hotel continued in business until 1970, when it closed for good. In 1973, the Wynnewood Historical Society bought the three-story structure and converted it into a museum of local history. Hotel rooms have been decorated to depict life in Oklahoma during the late 19th century and early 20th century. In 1978, the former hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Garvin County, Oklahoma, where it now resides along with Wynnewood’s Hargis-Mitchell-Cochran House and its Moore-Settle House.

==Geography==

The local petroleum industry blossomed in Garvin County during the second decade of the 20th century. The Texas Pacific Coal and Oil Company built an oil refinery in Wynnewood during 1922–23. Kerr-McGee Company bought the refinery in 1950. By 1957, employment at the refinery was about equal to all other employment in the Wynnewood vicinity. The Gary-Williams Energy Corporation bought the facility in 1995. In 2012, noted investor Carl Icahn announced that he had bought a controlling interest in CVR industries, which owned the 70,000 barrel per day refinery (BPD) at Wynnewood and a 115,000 BPD refinery at Coffeyville, Kansas. The Wynnewood refinery was one of only five operating in Oklahoma as of 2015.

==Media==
The &quot;Wynnewood Gazette&quot; began publication in 1906, and has continued into the 21st century. The Gazette in 1979 reported a story in nearby Elmore City about whether to allow high school students there to dance at a graduation celebration in the face of a town ordinance prohibiting public dancing; this controversy was picked up by national papers and became the core idea behind the 1984 film Footloose. 

Other early newspapers were the &quot;Wynnewood Republic&quot; and the &quot;Wynnewood Times&quot;.

==History==

Chickasha was founded by Hobart Johnstone Whitley, a land developer, banker, farmer and Rock Island Railroad executive. At the time of its founding, Chickasha was located in Pontotoc County, Chickasaw Nation. The founding took place in 1892 when the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway (Rock Island) built a track through Indian Territory. A post office was established in June 1892. One of the earliest industrial plants to come to Chickasha was the Chickasha Cotton Oil Company, which was established in 1899. The town incorporated in 1902. From 1910 to 1927, the town was served by the Chickasha Street Railway, the town&#x27;s own electric trolley system.

In 1908, the Oklahoma Industrial Institute and College for Girls was established in Chickasha. A local rancher named J. B. Sparks donated land for the school in memory of his daughter, Nellie. The girl was a Chickasaw descendant, and the land had been part of her allotment. The Nellie Sparks Dormitory commemorated her. The school was renamed as the Oklahoma College for Women in 1916. It became coeducational in 1965, and was renamed the Oklahoma College of Liberal Arts. It was renamed again in 1975 as the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma.

The Wilson and Bonfis Flying School opened in October 1941 to train cadets of the U.S. Army Air Force. Over eight thousand cadets completed training there during World War II. After the war, the facility became the Chickasha Municipal Airport.

Also during the war, the army built and used Borden General Hospital. This site now contains Grady Memorial Hospital, Five Oaks Medical Group, Southern Plains Medical Center and Borden Park.

A prisoner of war camp established in 1944 is now the site of the Grady County Fairgrounds.

<text>Minco is a city in Grady County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,500 at the 2020 census, a 8.1% decrease from 2010.

==History ==
Present-day Minco began as a settlement named Silver City on the Chisholm Trail. The community was initially a collection of tents housing Caddo, Wichita, Kiowa, and Comanche tribesmen. It was approximately east of the present-day location. After the Rock Island extended its railroad track to the Chisholm Trail, the town physically moved to the end of the rail line and renamed itself Minco.

The town was originally included in the Chickasaw Nation. Minco is believed to be named after the great Chickasaw chief and warrior, &quot;Itawamba Minco&quot;, who later acquired the name of Levi Colbert, and who resided on Chickasaw land in Mississippi, near Cotton Gin Port.

Minco was officially settled sometime &quot;circa&quot; 1890, several years before Oklahoma achieved statehood. The post office opened in July 1890. 

In its early stages, Minco was a very busy town because of its location at the end of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad until the railroad was extended further south two years later. Charles B. Campbell owned the occupancy rights of the land that the town was built on. His wife was Miss Maggie (Margaret) Williams, a daughter of W. G. (Caddo Bill) Williams, owner of the Half Moon Ranch, who started Silver City in 1872, by building a trading store for those cattlemen driving their herds of cattle up the Chisholm Trail.

Before the establishment of Minco as a town, three major expeditions passed through the area. The first expedition was conducted by Captain Randolph B. Marcy in 1849. Marcy was ordered to escort 1,500 individuals headed to the California gold fields. When the expedition approached the Minco area they kept to the south side of Buggy Creek, which Marcy named &quot;Deer Creek&quot;. Marcy named his route the Fort Smith to Santa Fe Trail. There was a road established in 1839-1840 on the north side of the Canadian River, that was also named the Fort Smith to Santa Fe Trail. This road had been laid out by Josiah Gregg, a Santa Fe merchant who had connections with merchants in Fort Smith, Arkansas.

During the summer of 1853, the first railroad survey was conducted from Fort Smith to Los Angeles by Lt. Amiel Weeks Whipple. Whipple&#x27;s survey followed Marcy&#x27;s route from Fort Smith, until they reached the Caddo County Buttes. At that point the expedition moved westward, whereas Marcy had turned north to join the Fort Smith to the Santa Fe Trail, not far north of Hydro. Whipple continued westward, leaving Oklahoma just west of the Antelope Hills in present-day Roger Mills County.

The Rock Island Railroad Co.&#x27;s original purpose in extending the railroad to Minco was to provide a gateway for the shipping of cattle from the grazing lands of the Chickasaw Nation, just to the south of the town. On August 4, 1901, the Chickasaw Nation&#x27;s land was opened to white settlement, making Minco a railroad hub for the entire region.
On October 14, 1901, local citizens formed a company for the purpose of selling vacant lots in the town to encourage settlement. It was known as the Minco Townsite and Investment Company.

Minco was originally composed mainly of merchants who provided supplies for the many travelers that used the railroad infrastructure of the town. It is the oldest town in the western part of Oklahoma, so its many businesses served residents for many miles around. The hardware store and tin shop originally opened by Kirk Woodworth in 1891 is still in existence. The remains of some of the hotels that were used by the many temporary residents stand along its Main Street.

In September 1894 Meta Chestnutt, a teacher from North Carolina who was determined to bring education to the frontier, specifically to Native Americans, along with the services of J.H. Bond, established the El Meta Bond College, one of the first of its kind in the area. The college offered elementary, grammar, and high school courses along with some music and drama courses. Having faced economic troubles for the whole of its existence, it was decommissioned in 1920 due to decreasing enrollment after the arrival of newer educational institutions that came with statehood. After the demolition of the old school building, a modern masonry armory was constructed in 1936 and today serves as a community gathering center. A community park occupies part of the old campus. In this park there is a plaque commemorating Meta Chestnutt and her contributions to the school.

In 1960, the first municipal natural gas company in Oklahoma was founded in Minco by James Burton Branum, Jr. It operated along with the Minco Tag Agency from an office in the back of what was then Branum&#x27;s Variety Store on Main street.

In 2007, the Minco Historical Society established a museum to exhibit the numerous historical facts associated with the town.

<text>Rush Springs is a town in Grady County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 997 at the 2020 census, a 19% decrease from 2010. The town promotes itself as the &quot;Watermelon Capital of the World.&quot;

The community&#x27;s largest event is the annual Rush Springs Watermelon Festival, which attracts about 30,000 people each year. They consume about 50,000 pounds of watermelon during this event.

==History==
The Wichita people established a village about 1850 near some springs on Rush Creek. (The present-day town of Rush Springs later developed about northwest of here.) Cattlemen watered their herds of cattle they were driving north from Texas to Kansas on the Chisholm Trail, which passed east of here.

On October 1, 1858, an event known as the Battle of the Wichita Village occurred near here, with spillover to the Wichita when the US Army destroyed their crops.

That year, Brigadier General David S. Briggs had ordered Brevet Major Earl Van Dorn to take command of the Second Cavalry at Fort Belknap, Texas. He was directed to proceed north of the Red River into Indian Territory and forcibly restrain belligerent Comanche warriors who were raiding settlements. Van Dorn and his men stopped at Camp Radziminski in Indian Territory. Van Dorn and his men advanced on the Comanche, who were camped on Rush Creek near a Wichita village. The Army was apparently unaware that the two tribes were conducting a peace conference.

Van Dorn and his men attacked the Comanche camp about dawn on October 1, 1858, catching the warriors completely off guard. In the aftermath of the attack, the troops found that the Comanche had lost seventy people, mostly men but also some tribeswomen who had accompanied them. Any survivors had fled. The army casualties were four men dead and one missing, who was presumed killed. Major Van Dorn was seriously wounded, but survived to fight again. The army was reported to have set fire to the Wichita fields nearby, destroying their food crop and endangering their survival. The Wichita fled to Fort Arbuckle to seek assistance from the U.S. government.

In 1871, supplies bound for Fort Sill (which had been founded in 1869), were brought through Rush Springs. The Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railway (also known as the M-K-T or Katy) had been completed to the Choctaw Nation community of Caddo. Supplies were transferred here to wagons to transport them to Rush Springs. Freight and stage travel from Caddo to Rush Springs was discontinued about 1885.

The first post office was designated as Parr, and opened at the Samuel M. Huntley ranch house in July 1883. The house was southeast of Rush Springs. When the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway (usually called simply the Rock Island) completed its line through Rush Springs in July 1892, the post office relocated into the town and was renamed for it. of town was surveyed and platted. It was incorporated on November 21, 1898. At that time, the community was located within Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation.

By 1900 the community had 518 residents and 588 by 1907, when Oklahoma became a state. At that time, new county jurisdictions were set up, and Rush Springs was located in Grady County, Oklahoma.

During the Great Depression, a Civilian Conservation Corps project was initiated on the east side of Rush Springs to provide employment and improve the region. Young men were paid to construct terraces and ponds and to restore vegetation by replanting trees. The project camp was opened June 18, 1933, and closed July 20, 1942.

<text>Verden is a town in western Grady County, Oklahoma, United States. It abuts the Caddo County line, and is probably best known as the site of the 1865 Camp Napoleon Council. The population was 580 at the 2020 census, an increase from 530 in 2010.

==History==
A rural community called &quot;Cottonwood Grove&quot; began to emerge near the present site of Verden before the Civil War. It was on the eastern edge of the Kiowa and Comanche reservation that was established by the Medicine Lodge Treaty, that was made with the U.S. government in 1867. A stage stop was established at Cottonwood Grove for travelers en route from Boggy Depot to the Kiowa Agency, Fort Sill, and Fort Cobb. The land around the community, outside the reservation, belonged to the Half Moon Ranch, owned by W. G. &quot;Caddo&quot; Williams. His son-in-law, Charles Campbell, owner of the 7BC Ranch, and E. B. Johnson bought the Half Moon around 1900.

The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (a.k.a. CRI&amp;P or Rock Island Railroad) built tracks through this area, between Chickasha and Mangum in 1900. James N. Jones and his family claimed the land around Cottonwood Grove when the tribes living near the Kiowa Agency were allowed to claim their land allotments. A post office was established at Cottonwood Grove, in 1899, but was discontinued in 1900. Another post office was established in 1902, which was named &quot;Verden&quot;, because there was another Cottonwood Grove post office elsewhere in the Oklahoma Territory. The town was platted in 1904, and A. A. Hiatt sold the lots for the CRI&amp;P townsite division. In 1907, Verden became a town incorporated in Oklahoma Territory by the commissioners of Caddo County, and had a population of 312.

Agriculture has been the main economic activity in Verden since its founding, and the railroad made Verden an important shipping point for products of the farms and ranches. The town&#x27;s public school began in 1905 and absorbed a Caddo County district in 1917. By 1910, the population had climbed to 524 and the town had two banks, a newspaper, the &quot;Verden News&quot;, a telephone connection, an electric company, a grain elevator, a cotton yard, a cotton gin, a milling company, a lumberyard, and several retail outlets. The business district had survived a major fire in 1908. It also survived several floods that plagued the Washita River valley.

==Geography==
Verden is located in western Grady County. It is on U.S. Route 62 and State Highway 9, west of Chickasha, the county seat, and east of Anadarko.

The town&#x27;s western border follows the Caddo County line, and the Washita River flows to the east just outside the northern border of the town.

==History==
&quot;The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot; states only that the town name was for Medford, Massachusetts, which it says was the home town of a railroad official.

Before the opening of the Cherokee Outlet to non-Indian settlement on September 16, 1893, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway (later the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad) built a line from southern Kansas that passed through the future Medford townsite in a north–south direction. A post office was established October 31, 1893. The townsfolk voted to incorporate on March 10, 1894. In 1897 the Gulf Railroad (later the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway) built a line that passed through Medford from northwest to southeast. Located in a wheat-growing region, Medford served as an agricultural trade center with a flour mill and several grain elevators. By 1909 the local economy supported three banks and three weekly newspapers.

Voters in Grant County chose Medford as the county seat by an election on May 27, 1908. A courthouse was dedicated July 4, 1910. A fire destroyed five blocks of businesses and residences on June 25, 1911.

On July 9, 2022 at about 2:30 PM an explosion and fire in the ONEOK plant one mile south of the city caused an evacuation of a two mile radius around the plant. On July 11, the evacuation zone was decreased to one mile around the plant.

<doc id="130232" wikidata="Q1900766" url="?curid=130232" title="Pond Creek, Oklahoma">
<text>Pond Creek is a city in Grant County, Oklahoma, United States, along the Salt Fork Arkansas River. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 856, a 4.5 percent decline from the figure of 896 in 2000.

==History==
Before people of European descent came on the scene, the region around the present town of Pond Creek was traversed by many of the nomadic Native Americans of the Great Plains. Although the land is now heavily agricultural there are still traces of campsites along the numerous creeks of the drainage of the Salt Fork of the Arkansas River. When many of the Native American groups were moved onto reservations in what is now Oklahoma, towns and trading posts were established. Eventually the present-day Oklahoma was divided into Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory. The history of Pond Creek and the surrounding area can be easily confused with other streams called Pond Creek (see e.g.). The present community of Pond Creek is located in what is called the Cherokee Strip, more properly known as the Cherokee Outlet. The land at the confluence of Osage Creek and Pond Creek was known as the Pond Creek Stockade on the original Chisholm Trail used by cattle drivers bringing herds of Texas longhorns north to the railroad head first at Abilene, Kansas then later to Wichita and Caldwell.
 This location is about 4 miles north of the present town of Pond Creek near the present village of Jefferson. Two markers have been placed in this area commemorating the untimely demise of two cowboys. There are two granite markers placed near Pond Creek on the old Chisholm Trail.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a branch line north–south from Caldwell, Kansas to Pond Creek in 1888. By 1893, it was incrementally built to Fort Worth, Texas. It was foreclosed on in 1891 and taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut-down in 1980. The Kansas-Texas mainline was sold to a subsidiary of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad as the Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merging in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, which merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island.&quot;

Pond Creek was settled as a town during the Cherokee Strip Land Run in 1893. According to the &quot;Chronicles of Oklahoma&quot;, &quot;The government townsite of Pond Creek was first entered at 2:10 on the day of the run. By evening, it contained some 8,000 inhabitants, and boasted a good hotel, several restaurants, a dozen law offices, two general stores and six or seven grocery stores.&quot; The settlers soon found that there was not enough water to support the new town; the government had dug wells for all of the government townsites, including Pond Creek, but all the water in Pond Creek&#x27;s well was quickly used up. Soldiers dug a new well but found only salt water. Water from the Salt Fork River was brought to Pond Creek and sold for five cents a cup, but it was not fit for human or animal consumption. Beer became a precious commodity, selling for fifty to seventy-five cents a bottle. Water from stagnant creek pools was given to animals. The area also experienced a violent sand storm and wildfires.

In addition to these tribulations, the citizens of Pond Creek had to do battle with the powerful railroad interests, in this case the &quot;Rock Island Line&quot; or CRI&amp;P railroad, to get a coveted depot. This conflict has been called the Enid-Pond Creek Railroad War. Briefly, the railroad had established a station for Pond Creek and the federal government established a different station about 4 miles south of the railroad town. The railroad refused to stop at the government Pond Creek until a combination of citizen action and congressional action forced them to change. Pond Creek legend has it that the railroad specified a mail stop at Pond Creek so to keep face they merely changed the name of railroad Pond Creek to Jefferson and made government Pond Creek the Pond Creek station. This story doesn&#x27;t quite correspond with most personal histories of the controversy but it makes a colorful tale.

<text>Wakita is a town in Grant County, Oklahoma, United States, approximately south of the Kansas border. Its population was 311 at the 2020 census, a decrease of 9.5 percent (from 344) at the 2010 census.

==History==
Before the town&#x27;s founding in 1898, there was a dispute over the right to name the town. The town&#x27;s postmaster, and the owner of the first general store, and the town&#x27;s first postmaster, believed it should be named Whiteville. Local Deputy U.S. Marshall Herbert John Green motioned for the town be named after a Cherokee chief of local significance named Wakita (pronounced Wok-ih-taw). Green and other local settlers wanted to name the town in the chief&#x27;s honor because of a protective spell cast by the chief&#x27;s tribe to protect the area around the town, between Crooked Creek and Pond Creek, from tornadoes for 100 years. The name was also favored because of a battle that had occurred in the area under the leadership of this chief.

Citing historian George Shirk, the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot; states that &quot;Wakita&quot; is a Cherokee word for water collected in a small depression, such as a buffalo wallow. The same source states that Charles N. Gould claimed it was probably a Creek word meaning &quot;to cry&quot; or &quot;to lament&quot;.

The town was founded when the Cherokee Outlet was opened to non-Native American settlement on September 16, 1893. A post office opened November 14, 1893. The population grew when the Hutchison and Southern Railroad (later the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway) built a line through the area in 1897. At statehood in 1907, Wakita had 388 residents; by 1910, it had grown to 405.

Wakita was selected as a filming location for the Hollywood blockbuster &quot;Twister&quot; (1996). In the film, the town is referred to by name, and the water tower bearing its name is shown.

On May 10, 2010, numerous tornadoes touched down in Grant County, causing significant damage near the Wakita area. However, the town itself was not destroyed.

Students in Wakita went to school at Wakita Public School K-12 through the 2010–2011 school year, after which the school closed due to low enrollment (30 students) and lack of necessary funding. Wakita Schools merged with Medford Public Schools, although many Wakita students also attend Pond Creek-Hunter High School.

==Notable people==

* Cindy Ross, first female president of Cameron University

==Popular culture==
Wakita was the setting of a 1984 television commercial about DuPont&#x27;s subsidiary Conoco using seismograph technology to search for oil. It was aired during the 1984 World Series. The voice over starts with, &quot;Nothing much changes in Wakita, Oklahoma.&quot;

Wakita was featured in the 1996 blockbuster film &quot;Twister&quot; starring Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton in which Wakita was destroyed by an F4 tornado that was part of a storm system later spawning an F5 tornado. False fronts were built onto the existing store fronts for some shots and then were removed and replaced with rubble in the streets after the tornadic storm hit and the rest of the building was removed using CGI. Some original buildings were demolished and never replaced, with some of the bricks from the demolished buildings used to construct Twister Park. The Twister Museum, dedicated to movie memorabilia from Twister, opened a few months before the movie was released and remains a town attraction.

<text>Mangum is a city in and county seat of Greer County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 2,762 as of the 2020 United States census. Mangum was originally part of Old Greer County in the Texas panhandle. The community was named for A. S. Mangum, who owned the land on which the town was founded in 1882. It became part of the Oklahoma Territory in 1896, and thus part of the state of Oklahoma on November 16, 1907.

==History==
Beginning in 1876, the nearby Great Western Cattle Trail was used to drive cattle north from Texas to market. The community of Mangum began in 1882 when Henry Clay Sweet established it on land granted to A. S. Mangum by the state of Texas. The Mangum post office was established April 15, 1886. This part of Texas (old Greer County) was given to Oklahoma in 1896. During Mangum&#x27;s early days, the community&#x27;s economy largely depended on very large cattle ranches owned or leased by land companies such as the Day Land and Cattle Company of Texas and the Franklyn Land and Cattle Company, an English syndicate. The local cowboys called Mangum &quot;Tin City&quot; because so many tin cans were unrolled and nailed over the wooden planks that served as sidewalks.

The Kiser Salt Works, named for owner Ben Kiser and located on the Elm Fork of the Red River was one of the earliest production operations in what would become western Oklahoma. 

Other early businesses in or around Mangum included the Oklahoma Granite Company, which opened in 1904, the &quot;Mangum Star&quot; newspaper, first published in 1887, and the Mangum Brick Plant, established in 1903 by D. J. Doyle. The newspaper still publishes in the 21st century. The brick plant, now owned by Jed Winters, also still operates and has greatly expanded production.

By statehood, Mangum had a population of 2,672. It had two school buildings, an opera house and a county courthouse later listed in the National Register of Historical Places, NR 85000682. By 1930, the population had expanded to 4,806 (the highest recorded in the U.S. census). Agriculture had largely displaced the old cattle ranches, so the city could also boast of seven cotton gins, one cotton oil mill, one cotton compress, and one flour mill.

The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (aka Rock Island or CRI&amp;P) built a line from Chickasha, Oklahoma to Mangum in 1900. The Wichita Falls and Northwestern Railway, acquired by the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway (also known as M-K-T or Katy) in 1911, operated its own line through Mangum by 1910.

Mangum is home to the fourth longest-lasting light bulb, located in a fire house, according to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;.

<text>Laverne is a town in Harper County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,223 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Laverne&#x27;s origin is traced to John Mollman&#x27;s homestead, which he established in 1903. The site was then in Woodward County, Oklahoma Territory. A post office was established in 1896 with the name Laverne and continued operating until 1908. After 1908, mail addressed to Laverne was redirected to another post office named Speedmore (now defunct).

Mollman sold part of his acreage to a townsite promoter in 1911. The promoter platted the area and began selling lots. The Wichita Falls and Northwestern Railway (WF&amp;NW), a Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway (Katy) subsidiary, reached the new settlement in spring, 1912.

The community was named Laverne after the old post office was moved to the new site in May 1912. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, by June 1912, Laverne had 44 businesses, including the Laverne State Bank, the Fox Hotel (NR 78002236) and the Clover Hotel (NR 84003034). Both hotels were built in 1912.

<text>Keota is a town in southeastern Haskell County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 438 at the 2020 census, a 22.3 percent decrease over the figure of 564 recorded in 2010.

==History==
The town was first called &quot;KeeOtter&quot;, which was later changed to &quot;Keota&quot;. The town&#x27;s name may come from a Choctaw word meaning &quot;the fire gone out&quot;, referring to an entire tribe being destroyed by disease, or may be derived from &quot;Jim Keese&quot;, a rancher who owned the land where the townsite was located, and &quot;Otter,&quot; for Otter Creek, a tributary of the Sans Bois Creek which winds its way through town.

Keota was founded in 1904 by the Midland Valley Railroad&#x27;s land company, and a post office was established in 1905.

By 1911, the town supported several businesses, a hotel, and a lumberyard. The town supported local cotton growers, and was a railroad shipping point for their product.

The Great Depression caused Keota&#x27;s population to fall from 494 in 1920 to 470 in 1930, though it rebounded to 619 by 1970.

In 1971, the McClellan–Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System was established on the Arkansas River, about 10 miles north of Keota. A dam on the river created the Robert S. Kerr Reservoir, which reaches to Keota. This enabled the Port of Keota to be established. Light industry was beginning to be drawn to the town at the end of the twentieth century, though by 2013, little remained of the port but a boatlaunch The railway had long been abandoned.

On December 31, 1974, the nearby Otter Creek Archaeological Site (NR 74001661) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

At the time of its founding, Keota was located in Moshulatubbee District, Choctaw Nation.

<text>Kinta is a town in Haskell County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 297 at the 2010 census, an increase of 22.2 percent over the figure of 243 recorded in 2000.

==History==
Kinta was founded in 1901 by George W. Scott, son-in-law of Greenwood McCurtain, the last chief of the Choctaw Nation before Oklahoma became a state. Scott named the town for nearby Beaver Creek, the name &quot;Kinta&quot; being the Choctaw word for &quot;beaver.&quot; He moved his store to Kinta from San Bois, established a post office in his store, and built the first permanent building in town in 1903. San Bois was then the Choctaw capital, but had been bypassed by the Fort Smith and Western Railroad.

At the time of its founding, Kinta was located in the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

During the first three decades of the 20th century, the town economy was supported by coal mining and the production of wood products. When these two industries declined sharply in the 1930s, the railroad ceased operations. The town nearly failed with them. The town survived somehow, and by the start of the 21st century, the major employer was the Kinta Public School System.

<doc id="130246" wikidata="Q2779864" url="?curid=130246" title="McCurtain, Oklahoma">
<text>McCurtain is a town in Haskell County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 357 at the 2020 census, a 30.8% decrease over the figure of 516 recorded in 2010. A coal mine disaster in 1912 killed 73 miners and ended McCurtain&#x27;s prosperity. The mine explosion remains one of the worst disasters in Oklahoma history.

==History==
In 1889, coal deposits discovered in the area that would become southern Haskell County attracted some European miners and American entrepreneurs. They established a community called Panther, which was renamed in 1902 to honor Choctaw Principal Chief Green McCurtain. Another mining town, Chant, was established nearby, and the two began to grow together. McCurtain and Chant prospered after the Fort Smith and Western Railroad connected McCurtain with Fort Smith, Arkansas in 1901. The railroad was built westward until it reached the Canadian River in 1902. The San Bois Coal Company built four hundred company houses for miners living in McCurtain and Chant. By 1907 statehood the combined population of the two communities was 1,760.

A post office was established at Panther, Indian Territory on June 11, 1890. Its name was changed to McCurtain, Indian Territory on April 5, 1902. The site was located one half-mile west of its present site. At the time of its founding, the community was located in the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

In 1901 the two towns thrived as the Fort Smith and Western Railroad built to McCurtain, connecting it with Fort Smith, Arkansas. In 1902 the railroad continued building westward, reaching the South (main) Canadian River. The San Bois Coal Company built four hundred company houses, and McCurtain, as well as Chant, saw the addition of banks, stores, schools, newspapers, and even a bottling company. By 1907 statehood the combined population of the communities stood at 1,760, although in 1908 business directories suggested a combined population of 3,800, which would have been the largest to be seen in Haskell County. Newspapers that have served the two communities included the &quot;Haskell County Chant News&quot;, the &quot;Hustler&quot;, &quot;McCurtain American&quot;, &quot;McCurtain Leader&quot;, and &quot;Sans Bois News&quot;.

The towns and all of their successes, however, could not withstand the events of March 20, 1912, when a terrific underground explosion in Mine Number Two took the lives of seventy-three miners and sent the San Bois Coal Company into bankruptcy. With mining all but played out, the town&#x27;s combined population dropped to 1,341 in 1920. The communities officially consolidated in 1922, but the Chant post office had closed in 1910. In 1940 the population rested at 870, declining to 528 by 1960. By 2000 the last of the mines had all closed. The town&#x27;s population had dwindled to 466, a downward trend that reversed; in 2010 the number stood at 516. The only reminder of McCurtain&#x27;s once-prosperous past was a memorial standing silently at the site of old Mine Number Two and seventy-three graves in the nearby Miners Cemetery. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, &quot;The only reminder McCurtain had to show of its once prosperous past was a memorial standing silently at the site of old Mine Number Two and seventy-three graves in the nearby Miners Cemetery.&quot;

==Economic Development==
McCurtain&#x27;s rapid economic transformation began with the discovery of coal in 1889, the same year as the Land Run. This discovery attracted a diverse influx of people, including Eastern European miners and American entrepreneurs, fueling the town&#x27;s growth. At the forefront of this mining boom was the Sans Bois Mining Company, or Sans Bois Coal Company. In 1901, industrialist Henry Clay Frick, determined to source coal in his steel operations, purchased the Sans Bois Coal Company through ownership of the Fort Smith and Western Railway.

The town of McCurtain faced successive decades of economic decline following the tragic explosion at San Bois Coal Company&#x27;s Mine Number Two. The 1912 tragedy would claim the lives of 73 miners and would begin a series of decades that included substantial population decline, decreases in job opportunities in the area, economically depressed residents would grow accustomed to severe poverty and even the next several generations that remained in the area live at or below the poverty level.

<text>Stigler is a city in and the county seat of Haskell County, Oklahoma. The population was 2,685 at the time of the 2010 census, down from 2,731 recorded in 2000.

==History==
At the time of its founding, Newman, later Stigler, was located in Sans Bois County, a part of the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation in Indian Territory. A post office was established at Newman, Indian Territory on April 30, 1892. The community was named for Dr. Martin W. Newman, a pioneer and physician.

Joseph Stigler is said to have founded the town in 1889. He was familiar with the area, as earlier he had served as a deputy marshal under federal judge Isaac C. Parker, whose court in Fort Smith, Arkansas, had jurisdiction over Indian Territory. The post office name was changed to Stigler on May 3, 1893 by the U.S. Post Office Service, because the former name caused some confusion with the town of Norman.

The Midland Valley Railroad was constructed to Stigler in 1904, which attracted more settlers and more types of businesses. By the following year, the town had become incorporated. At statehood in 1907, Stigler was named as the county seat of newly created Haskell County.

Stigler is home to the Haskell County Courthouse. In the late 20th century, the county court was known for having installed marble plaques inscribed with the Ten Commandments and the Mayflower Compact on the front lawn of the courthouse. (&quot;See Separation of church and state in the United States&quot;.) In the seventh commandment, the word &quot;adultery&quot; was misspelled as &quot;adultry&quot;. Opponents sued for the commandments to be removed, arguing that the installation was unconstitutional and violated the principle of the separation of church and state in the United States. The court agreed and ordered the Commandments removed from the lawn. However, it was only moved over about 20 feet and is basically still on the lawn of the courthouse.

<text>Tamaha is a town in Haskell County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 152 at the time of the 2020 United States census. Tamaha is a Choctaw word meaning &quot;town.&quot;

==Geography==
Tamaha is located on the banks of the Arkansas River, north northeast of Stigler and south of Vian.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and 0.16% is water.

==History==
Tamaha began as a riverboat landing on the Arkansas River in the 1830s. Initially, the community was called Pleasant Bluff, after a nearby geographic feature. During the Civil War, the Union steamer, &quot;J. R. Williams&quot;, had carried supplies for the Union army between Fort Smith, Arkansas and Fort Gibson in Indian Territory. On June 15, 1864, Confederate forces under Colonel Stand Watie attacked with cannon and small arms fire as the ship negotiated a bend at Pleasant Bluff. The ship was crippled and ran aground, where the Confederates captured it. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, the rusted skeleton of the steamer remains where it was grounded.

At the time of its founding, Tamaha was located in the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

The town grew slowly after the Civil War. The name changed to Tamaha in 1884, when a post office was established. It had a population of 237 in 1900, increasing to 501 in 1920. However, riverboat traffic, the major source of business, ceased in 1912, Two fires, one in 1919 and the other in 1930, destroyed much of the town. The population fell to 202 in 1930 and declined to its historic low of 80 in 1960. Most of the former residents moved to the nearby town of Stigler. The post office closed in 1954. In the 21st century, the main source of business is travel by vacationers, attracted by the nearby Robert S. Kerr Reservoir. The only physical link to the town&#x27;s past is the Tamaha Jail and Ferry Landing, included on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Haskell County, Oklahoma (NR 80003266).

<text>Whitefield is a town in northwestern Haskell County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 377 at the 2020 census, compared with the figure of 391 recorded in 2010. It was named for Methodist bishop George Whitefield (1714 - 1770).

==History==
At the time of its founding, the community that became Whitefield was located in the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation, in the Indian Territory.

Whitefield&#x27;s history can be traced to the American Civil War, when the Confederate Army established Camp Pike for two thousand Confederate soldiers in 1861. The camp was named for Confederate Brigadier General Albert Pike, who had persuaded the Five Civilized Tribes to ally with the Confederacy.

After the end of the Civil War, Camp Pike became a Choctaw trading post. The trading post and the adjacent community were renamed as Oklahoma, Indian Territory. Its clientele were not only members of the Choctaw tribe, but also white settlers who had permits from the tribe to farm land in the Choctaw Nation. Occasionally, it was patronized by white outlaws such as Belle Starr, who were hiding from the law in the mountains of southern Oklahoma.The Post Office wanted to change the name because of confusion with another post office already known as Oklahoma Station. In 1888, the local residents voted to accept Whitfield as the name of the settlement and post office. The post office at Whitefield, Indian Territory, which had originally been established as Oklahoma, Indian Territory on December 21, 1881, was reestablished on November 27, 1888. It was named for Bishop George Whitefield, an early-day Methodist leader.

Whitefield existed primarily as a town to support the nearby farms. By 1911, it counted approximately 500 residents. Improvements included two groceries, two general stores, a cotton gin and mill, a drugstore, a doctor, and a blacksmith. It had about 300 residents by 1920. Reportedly, the population declined sharply with the onset of the Great Depression. Whitfield incorporated in 1978, so its first Federal Census in 1980 recorded 240 people. The population has trended upward since that year.

==Geography==
Whitefield is located in northwestern Haskell County on high ground south of the Canadian River. 

Oklahoma State Highways 2 and 9 intersect in the center of Whitefield. OK-2 leads north to Interstate 40 near Warner and south to Kinta, while OK-9 leads east to Stigler, the Haskell county seat, and west to Eufaula.

<text>Atwood is a town in Hughes County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 74 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The town is named for Chester C. Atwood, an early settler of what would later become Hughes County, Oklahoma. Atwood was an educated farmer, extensive area landowner, and elected commissioner of Hughes County. He was born in July 1862 in central Texas, to natives of Tennessee who had migrated to Texas before the Civil War. In 1881, Atwood left Texas for the Mushulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. Settling in western Tobucksy County, some west of a pioneer general store owned by J.J. McAlester, Atwood married a young woman named Patsy Ann, of the Choctaw Nation, giving him settlement rights by marriage. By 1885, he was farming of what later would become eastern Hughes County, and was enumerated in the Choctaw Nation census of that year.

Population growth in the community near the Atwood farm brought a post office designation January 23, 1897, with &quot;Newburg&quot; as the assigned name and Henry S. Halloway established as postmaster.

A weekly newspaper, the &quot;Atwood Herald&quot;, kept citizens informed during the early 20th Century. The date when it ceased publication is unknown.

By 1900, Chester Atwood had increased his land holdings and his family included wife Patsy Ann (familiarly called Mattie), daughters Ottie (b. 1883) and Arrie (b. 1886), son Bennie (b. 1887), daughter Allie (b. 1889), son Coleman (b. 1891), and daughters Lizzie (b. 1893) and Ambrozia (b. 1895). Two other children born after 1900 died before reaching adulthood.

At statehood, counties created under the Choctaw Nation were redrawn and renamed. That portion of Tobucksy County in which Newburg lay, fell inside the new boundary of Hughes County, Oklahoma. On December 3, 1909, two years after Oklahoma statehood, the town of Newburg was renamed &quot;Atwood&quot;, honoring Chester C. Atwood as one of the significant pioneer members of the community.

Atwood served as an elected commissioner of Hughes County, and son Coleman Atwood worked as a local banker before moving to Holdenville during the Depression. Chester C. Atwood died after 1930.

The Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway built a line from Muskogee to the Red River, bypassing Newburg. Therefore, some of Newburg&#x27;s residents moved one mile south to take advantage of the rail system. In December 1909, they named their new settlement.

Atwood became a trading center for the agricultural trying center around it. A grist mill was built in 1910, followed by a bank, a livery, a drug store and five general stores. The population grew to 150 by 1913.

In 1993, Atwood received a $75,000 federal grant to modernize its fire protection system. Atwood incorporated as a town in 1994.

The post office in Atwood was slated for possible closure by the United States Postal Service in 2012.

<text>Calvin is a town in Hughes County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 294 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The present community of Calvin was established in 1895, when the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway (C O &amp; G) laid a line through the Choctaw Nation between McAlester (then in Indian Territory) and Oklahoma City (then in Oklahoma Territory). The community was initially called &quot;Riverview&quot;, for its location on the south bank of the Canadian River. The Riverview post office was established on March 21, 1895, with John Wilbur as postmaster. The town (and post office) name was changed to Calvin in June 1895, to honor the Choctaw landowner, Calvin Perry. The Choctaw Nation Town Site Commission surveyed Calvin&#x27;s site and divided it into 350 lots, which were put up for sale.

About 1904, a fire destroyed several business buildings and the Masonic Lodge on Canadian Street (the main street in downtown Calvin. These losses were soon replaced with new all-brick buildings. In 1905, the population was reportedly about 300. From then until the Great Depression, Calvin served as a busy trade center for the area&#x27;s produce.

In 1906 J. W. Hundley established a store and in 1907 erected a building, the largest mercantile establishment in Hughes County. A ferry operating across the Canadian River gave access to Calvin&#x27;s cotton market and railroad connections. The Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad (M, O &amp;G) constructed a line through the area, reaching Calvin in 1909. By that time the growing town offered the surrounding agricultural community a choice of four cotton gins, eight general stores, two hotels, and numerous other businesses typical of the era.

<text>Dustin is a town in Hughes County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 327 at the time of the 2020 United States census.

==History==
The town was called Watsonville when its community first formed in the late 19th century. When the post office opened there on April 18, 1898, it was officially named Watsonville. The original site was south of the North Canadian River in the area then known as the Creek Nation in Indian Territory.

The post office site was moved north of the present site, and its name changed to Spokogee, on June 27, 1902, though the same person, Marion J. Butler, remained as postmaster. After the Fort Smith and Western Railroad built its Fort Smith–Guthrie line through the area in 1903, the town and post office were both officially changed to Dustin on May 9, 1904.

The Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway (MO&amp;G), built a north–south line through Dustin in 1905.

Dustin became a trading and commercial center for the surrounding agricultural area. Early businesses included two banks, two drug stores, three doctors, and two hardware stores. Although a school was among the first buildings constructed, it burned down before the school year began. It was soon replaced and two male teachers were hired. The MO&amp;G maintained a railroad round house for working on its locomotives. Before the end of the first decade, Dustin had added four barbershops, a third barbershop, a third drug store, a fourth doctor, a third bank, a livery stable, two hotels, two cotton gins, an ice plant/bottling plant, and a wagon factory. Several newspapers, including the &quot;Dustin Dispatch&quot;, the &quot;Dustin News&quot;, and the &quot;Dustonian&quot;, informed the citizens in the early decades of the twentieth century.

Dustin built its first water supply system in 1912. In the 1930s, the community built Lake Dustin, a community-owned spring-fed reservoir. In 2012, Dustin began constructing a new municipal water supply system in 2003. The 1910 census reported that Dustin had a population of 579, which increased to an all-time high of 713 in 1920.

<text>Gerty is a town in southern Hughes County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 118 at the 2010 census.

==History==
During the early 1830s, as a result of President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s Indian Relocation policy, the Choctaw Indians began moving into this part of what was called Indian Territory. One Choctaw community, then called &quot;Buzzard Flop,&quot; became a rest stop for travelers and freight wagons headed westward. The site provided ample clear spring water and adequate level ground on which to camp. The Choctaws also found that the site was suitable cattle country, and several families built ranches in the area.

By 1880, the Choctaws had found that this made ideal country of cattle raising. In 1891 the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway (also known as the CRI&amp;P or &quot;Rock Island&quot;) built an east-west line ten miles north of Guertie. In 1893 James S. Raydon, a Choctaw who had already received his allotment of land from the Dawes Commission, built a log cabin, put in a store, and established a post office. The latter was approved by the federal government on June 15, 1894, and called &quot;Guertie&quot;, for Raydon&#x27;s daughter. Raydon was the first postmaster.

After the Dawes Commission had finished allotting land to eligible Choctaws, George Sorrell sold his quarter section, containing Guertie, to the federal government. The townsite was then surveyed and the lots sold, stimulating settlement. In December 1907 the town name was changed to Raydon. In that year of statehood the town had population of 600, four general mercantile stores, three hotels, three drug stores, two blacksmith shops, three active lodges, three churches, a hospital, a bank, a café, a sawmill, and a newspaper called the &quot;Guertie News&quot;. Because citizens began to get mail intended for an office name &quot;Ragan&quot;, in June 1910 the Post Office Department changed the name back to Guertie and then changed the spelling to Gerty, to avoid confusion with Guthrie in Logan County.

Gerty has not showed a clear trend of population since its establishment. It first appeared in the U.S. census of 1910, showing a population of 305. The number declined to 137 by 1930, before rising to 206 by 1960. It has never reached 200 in the census between 1960 and the present.

<text>Holdenville is a city in and county seat of Hughes County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 5,934 at the time of the 2020 United States census. 

==History==
Holdenville traces its origin to a Creek settlement called &quot;echo&quot;, when translated means &quot;deer&quot;. George B. Fentress operated a general store there. A post office called &quot;Fentress&quot; opened there on May 24, 1895. The Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad was constructed in the 1890s from Arkansas to Indian Territory. Between 1895 and 1897, the construction passed through the Creek Nation. During this period, a railroad camp was set up to service the railroad construction. The railroad workers called the camp &quot;Holden&quot; in honor of J.F. Holden, the Auditor and Traffic Manager of Choctaw, Oklahoma, and Gulf Railroad. In 1895, a request was delivered to the U.S. Congress to establish a post office in Holden. The request was rejected because the name was too similar to another post office called &quot;Holder.&quot; The proposed name was then altered to &quot;Holdenville&quot; and was accepted.

In 1898, settlers petitioned Indian Territory to incorporate Holdenville as a town. A hearing was granted and on November 14, 1898, Holdenville was incorporated as part of Indian Territory. D. J. Red was elected mayor at the first municipal election, held December 27, 1898. The first city council meeting was held January 4, 1899. The St. Louis, Oklahoma and Southern Railway (later the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway) constructed a line between 1900 and 1901 from Sapulpa to the Red River that passed through Holdenville. An election was held on June 27, 1908, to determine the permanent county seat. Contending communities were Holdenville, Wetumka, Calvin, and Lamar. None of the candidates won a majority, so a runoff election was held on September 10, 1908, between the two top vote-getters, Holdenville and Wetumka. This time, Holdenville won the election.

Until it was named in a grand jury investigation in 1904, Holdenville was a sundown town where African Americans were not allowed to live or even wait for a train. 

On April 27, 2024, an EF3 tornado struck the town as part of a larger tornado outbreak that affected the Great Plains region, causing two fatalities and extensive damage.

<text>Lamar is a town in Hughes County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 158 at the 2010 census.

==History==
After the Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway (later the Kansas, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway (KO&amp;G) constructed a line in 1907 connecting Dustin and Calvin, the Lamar community developed midway between the two towns. A post office was established on July 23, 1907. On September 14, 1907, J. R. Luttrell published the first issue of the weekly &quot;Lamar News&quot;. Two years later Lamar had a bank, a livery, a cotton gin, a lumberyard, a tin shop, a hardware store, and five general stores. Lamar incorporated on January 2, 1908. In 1909 R. L. Polk&#x27;s Oklahoma State Gazetteer and Business Directory estimated that Lamar had a population of five hundred. Citizens passed a ten-thousand-dollar bond issue in May 1909 for the construction of a two-story, brick school building, completed in May 1910.

On July 5, 1922, Lamar became a consolidated school district. In October of that year citizens voted by a margin of two to one to incorporate the town. After the Bank of Lamar voluntarily liquidated on December 12, 1928, residents conducted their banking in Holdenville. During the 1940s and 1950s the town supported several groceries and gas stations.

The first federal census for Lamar reported a population of 250 in 1930. The number peaked at 296 in 1940. By 1950 it had declined to 180 and continued on a downward spiral to a low of 97 in 1990. At the turn of the twenty-first century Lamar served as a &quot;bedroom&quot; community for 172 residents, the majority of whom commuted thirty to forty-five minutes to work. The 2010 census recorded 158 inhabitants.

By 1918 the surrounding agricultural area supported two cotton gins, two blacksmith shops, a bank, four general stores, and sundry other businesses. With an estimated population of 350, citizens attended the Baptist and Methodist churches and read the weekly newspaper, the &quot;Lamar Sun&quot;.

<text>Stuart is a town in southeastern Hughes County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 180 at the 2010 census, down from 220 in 2000.

==History==
In the late 19th Century, a settlement known as &quot;Hoyuby&quot;, Indian Territory, existed at this site in the Choctaw Nation. Hoyuby post office was established June 23, 1892, with John H. Elliott as the first postmaster. The community began growing after 1895, when the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad (later the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad) built a line through Stuart, connecting it to McAlester and Oklahoma City. On April 14, 1896, the post office was renamed Stuart, in honor of Judge Charles Bingley Stuart of McAlester.

Berry Alexander &quot;B. A.&quot; and Mary Youngblood Nunn came from Texas to Stuart and built a two-story, wood-frame hotel that became known as the Stuart Hotel (listed in the National Register of Historic Places, NR 82001496). By 1909 local citizens had established Baptist, Christian, and Methodist churches. The Bank of Stuart, five general stores, two blacksmith shops, two lumberyards, a cotton gin, and several liveries served the surrounding agricultural area. Cotton was the main cash crop. Royal C. Stuart, Judge Stuart&#x27;s son, started his banking career as a cashier at the Bank of Stuart. Nine years later the economy supported a second bank, the &quot;Stuart Chronicle&quot; newspaper, a gristmill, and the Choctaw Cotton Oil Company. Other early newspapers included the &quot;Stuart Educator&quot;, the &quot;Stuart Enterprise&quot;, and the &quot;Stuart Star&quot;. In the 1930s Stuart served as a watering station for the railroad. In addition, the town also had a blacksmith, two cotton gins, and the Texas Pipe Line Company. By the 1940s and 1950s both banks had closed, and citizens traveled to Holdenville or McAlester for their banking needs. Grocery stores and gasoline stations continued to operate in Stuart.

==Geography==

<doc id="130259" wikidata="Q2241307" url="?curid=130259" title="Wetumka, Oklahoma">
<text>Wetumka is a city in northern Hughes County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,135 as of the 2020 Census. The Muscogee Creek who first settled it after removal in the 1830s named it for their ancestral town of Wetumpka in Alabama. &quot;Wetumka&quot; is a Muskogee language word meaning &quot;rumbling waters.&quot;

In the 21st century, it is the headquarters for two federally recognized tribes, the Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town and the Kialegee Tribal Town. The town holds Sucker Day annually, on the last Saturday in September.

==History==
The St. Louis, Oklahoma and Southern Railway built a line from Sapulpa, Oklahoma through Wetumka to the Red River in 1900-1901. Wetumka prospered as a major shipping point for cotton, corn, pecans, and livestock produced by farmers in the surrounding area. An election was held in 1908 to determine the permanent county seat, and Wetumka made it to a runoff election for that title, although Holdenville prevailed. By 1909, the community had three banks, two cotton gins, three blacksmith shops, two liveries, and a tin shop. Early newspapers included the &quot;Wetumka News-Herald&quot;, the &quot;Wetumka News&quot;, the &quot;Wetumka Herald&quot;, and the &quot;Wetumka Gazette&quot;. A two-story building constructed in 1912 housed the city hall and the Masonic Lodge.

By 1918, four cotton gins, a mill and elevator, a wagonyard, an ice company, and a water and light company had joined the list of businesses open in Wetumka. The 1920 census reported that the population had jumped from 231 in 1910 to 1422 in 1920. Growth would continue through 1950. Since then a long-term decline has lasted through the 2010 census as agriculture has needed fewer workers.

The Wetumka oil field opened in 1919. A crowd of oil workers poured into town. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot; estimates the number of temporary workers brought the total city population to about four thousand. However, the 1920 census does not support this number. There was sufficient activity to cause the railroad to build a large freight warehouse in April 1925. A three-story hotel opened in June of that year. With the booming economy, the city paved the streets and added three rooms to the school building.

Perhaps the most significant sign of growth was that the citizens petitioned Governor Jack C. Walton to designate Wetumka as a city of the &quot;first class&quot;. Walton signed the proclamation on May 21, 1923, and the city held an election on June 26, 1925 for a mayor, a city marshal, and council members.

By 1930, oil and agriculture were the dominant employers in Wetumka&#x27;s economy, with five cotton gins and twelve oil companies operating. The city had added nine churches, a park, a lake, and a junior college. Railey Manufacturing Company provided employment to workers who crafted wood flooring and doors. Municipal plants provided water and electricity, Oklahoma Natural Gas supplied gas, and Southwestern State Telephone furnished phone service. But in the 1930s, cotton production began a major decline.

During World War II, the Army operated a prisoner-of-war camp for German prisoners. This closed in 1945 after the end of the war. The city-owned Wetumka General Hospital opened in March 1960. In March 1973 a municipal complex opened to replace city hall, which had been destroyed by fire on November 13, 1971. By the 1970s all cotton gins were defunct.

<text>Yeager is a town in Hughes County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 75 at the 2010 census. Developed in the early 1900s, the town grew with the help of an oil and gas field, but has always had a low population.

==History==
According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot; the present community was named for a Creek allottee, Hattie Yargee. The town was developed along the St. Louis, Oklahoma and Southern Railway, which was built between 1900 and 1901. When a post office was established on February 6, 1902, the Post Office Department changed the spelling of the office to the present Yeager. An oil and gas field opened in the town in 1917 and helped support the railroad industry in the 1920s.

In 1917, the Yeager Oil Field opened, producing 25 to 2500 barrels of oil per day. As the Yeager field developed during the 1920s, the railroad&#x27;s revenue dramatically increased by transporting lumber, rig timber, and oil-field equipment to the community. By 1918 citizens had established a Baptist Church and a Church of Christ. In 1918 &quot;R. L. Polk&#x27;s Oklahoma State Gazetteer and Business Directory&quot; estimated Yeager&#x27;s population at 350.

In the mid-1940s Fred A. Ashburn and C. D. Wood operated grocery and filling stations. By the mid-1950s Yeager had a grocery and a filling station. After a fire destroyed the school building on January 18, 1957, voters approved a bond issue to rebuild the facility.

<doc id="130261" wikidata="Q446314" url="?curid=130261" title="Altus, Oklahoma">
<text>Altus () is a city in and the county seat of Jackson County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 18,729 at the 2020 census.

Altus is home to Altus Air Force Base, the United States Air Force training base for C-17, KC-46 and KC-135 aircrews. It is also home to Western Oklahoma State College and Southwest Technology Center.

==History==
The town that would later be named Altus was founded in 1886. The community was originally called &quot;Frazer&quot;, a settlement of about 50 people on Bitter Creek that served as a trading post on the Great Western Cattle Trail. Cowboys driving herds northward often stopped to buy buttermilk from John McClearan. Thus, the town was known locally as &quot;Buttermilk Station&quot;. The Frazer post office opened February 18, 1886. A flash flood nearly destroyed Frazer on June 4, 1891. The residents moved to higher ground east of the original site. W. R. Baucum suggested renaming the town &quot;Altus&quot;, a Latin word meaning &quot;high&quot;. This name stuck, although the town was also known as &quot;Leger&quot; from July 10, 1901, to May 14, 1904.

The population doubled between the time of Oklahoma statehood and the 1910 census and even increased during the Great Depression. Although Altus had been designated as the Jackson county seat at the time of statehood, an election was held in 1908 to determine the permanent seat. The two towns contending were Altus and Olustee. Altus won by a vote of 2,077 to 1,365. The county courthouse was built there in 1910. An irrigation project in the 1940s and World War II led to further growth in the town as the nearby airfield was used to train military pilots.

In 1908, the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway (acquired by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in 1929) built a line through Altus. Around the same time, the Altus, Wichita Falls and Hollis Railway (which became the Wichita Falls and Northwestern Railway in 1911, then was acquired by the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway in 1922) constructed a line from Altus to the Oklahoma-Texas border. The railroads stimulated economic growth in the area and made Altus a regional agricultural center. By 1930, Altus had eight cotton gins, two cotton compresses, and eighteen wholesale businesses.

==Geography==
Altus is located in northeastern Jackson County. It is situated in what used to be Old Greer County, an area with disputed ownership until a Supreme Court decision awarded it to Oklahoma Territory instead of Texas. The city lies between the main channel and North Fork of the Red River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Altus has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.08%, are water.

===Climate===
Altus has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) bordering upon a semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;). Summers are very hot to sweltering, though occasionally heavy rainfall does occur due to remains of Gulf of Mexico hurricanes moving inland. A record high of was recorded twice in 1936.

Autumn is brief, with generally very warm afternoons and comfortably cool mornings, while winter is extremely variable. Chinook winds can sometimes raise temperatures to uncomfortably hot even in the low winter sun, in the process often drying out vegetation to produce wildfires. On the other hand, if a block forms over the Gulf of Alaska very cold air can be driven into the Plains States from Canada, producing temperatures below in extreme cases. Such cold temperatures on average occur once every three winters, although on average 78.5 mornings each year fall to or below the freezing point. Snowfall is rare and erratic: the most in a months being in January 1966, while most rainfall comes during the unsettled spring season, when heavy thunderstorms can occur from the convergence of hot and cold air masses to produce very intense short-period rainfall. The wettest month has been May 1980 with , whilst zero precipitation has on occasion been recorded in every month except May and June, and the wettest 24 hour period on October 20, 1983, with . The wettest calendar year has been 1941 with and the driest 1970 with .
==Demographics==
As of the census of 2010, there were 19,813 people living in the city. The population density was . There were 8,890 housing units at an average density of .

It was named in honor of rancher Stephen W. Ryan, an Arkansas native who settled near present-day Ryan in 1875.

As a result of his marriage to a Chickasaw woman, Ryan acquired vast acreage in present Jefferson County, then a part of Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation, Indian Territory. When the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway constructed a station on Ryan&#x27;s land in 1892, he platted the site for the town that now bears his name. A post office had been established in that locality in June 1890, and Ryan&#x27;s home, built &quot;circa&quot; 1877, was the community&#x27;s first residence.

Ryan was named the seat of Jefferson County by delegates to the 1906 Constitutional Convention. It lost that title in February 1912, when county voters chose Waurika to be the county seat. Ryan developed as an agricultural and ranching community. Local ranchers raised cattle and hogs, and farmers produced cotton, corn, and wheat. The fruit industry was a prosperous enterprise, as pears, peaches, apples, plums, and strawberries were grown in abundance.

Fire nearly destroyed Ryan in December 1895, but the residents rebuilt. Ryan had 1,115 residents in 1907. By 1908, it had thirty businesses, including two banks, a hotel, a cotton gin, two lumberyards, a flour mill, and a cottonseed oil mill.

At the start of the twenty-first century, Ryan had four Protestant churches and one Catholic church. Two primary and secondary schools were available to the public. The Ryan public schools and the Ryan Nursing Home were the town&#x27;s major employers. The Ryan Nursing home, however, closed in 2011.

<text>Waurika is the county seat of Jefferson County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,837 as of the 2020 United States census.

An article from 1985 in &quot;The Oklahoman&quot; claimed that Waurika promoted itself as &quot;The Parakeet Capital of the World,&quot; while giving no explanation for using this slogan. The Waurika Chamber of Commerce website in 2020 echoed that the town was &quot;once a parakeet paradise,&quot; but currently seems to be promoting the motto &quot;On The Trail, By The Lake&quot;, complete with a logo of a cowboy bronc-riding a fish.

==City name==
The name is the anglicized version of the Comanche compound &quot;woarɨhka&quot; (&quot;worm eater&quot;) from &quot;woa&quot; (&quot;worm&quot;) + &quot;tɨhka&quot; (&quot;eat&quot;) and presumably refers to early European settlers whose plowing humorously resembled digging for worms. Without indicating the source of their opinions, the City of Waurika and the Oklahoma Historical Society say the name means &quot;clear (or pure) water&quot; in some unidentified &quot;American Indian language&quot;.

==History==

Waurika was settled after the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache Reservation was opened to non-Indians on August 6, 1901. The first white settler was James McGraw, who homesteaded on the present town site after moving from Burlington, Iowa. The first sale of town lots was held on June 18, 1902. Nearly three thousand people attended the sale.

Waurika was incorporated in May 1903. On May 8 of that year, C.A. McBrian was sworn in as the town&#x27;s first mayor. At the time of its founding, Waurika was located in Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation.

The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway came to Waurika in January 1902 after the railroad superintendent &quot;designated the town as a flag station.&quot; Waurika was formerly the northern terminus for the Wichita Falls and Oklahoma Railway, one of the 20th century properties of Frank Kell and Joseph A.

<text>Milburn is a town in Johnston County, Oklahoma, United States, along the Blue River. The population was 252 as of the 2020 Census. The town is notable as the location of the Chickasaw White House, the former home of Chickasaw Governor Douglas H. Johnston. This home is now a museum and is listed on the NRHP.

==History==
A town named Ellen was formed in the Chickasaw Nation (Indian Territory) in 1856, approximately from the present town of Milburn. When the Western Oklahoma Railroad (later known as the Choctaw Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad) was built, W. J. Milburn, a druggist from Emet, Emet, persuaded the Chickasaw landowner, M. C. Condon, to give Milburn the power of attorney to negotiate a new townsite near the railroad. Milburn tried to persuade the postmaster at Ellen to move his location to the new site and rename it. He submitted the name Condon, which the Post Office rejected. Many names were proposed for the new town. Initially, the railroad wanted to name it Morris, then changed to McLish. Finally, the name Milburn was agreed upon in August 1901.

By 1904, Milburn had sufficient population to incorporate as a Chickasaw town. After Oklahoma became a state in 1907, an election was held to choose the new Johnston County seat. Milburn lost to Tishomingo.

<text>Mill Creek is a town in Johnston County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 293 as of the 2020 Census. Mill Creek Community is an unincorporated area of Johnston County that surrounds the town and claims to have about 1,000 residents, including those who live within the town limits. Local residents consider the town as the focal point of the community.

==History==
In 1852, when the post office was first established, the town was named Mineral Hill and was within the Choctaw Nation, Indian Territory. The 1855 Treaty of Separation between the Choctaws and Chickasaws established the latter as a separate nation, effective March 4, 1856. Mill Creek then fell within the Chickasaw Nation boundaries. The post office was renamed Harris Mill in 1859, after Chickasaw Governor Cyrus Harris built a large grist mill on the local creek. The name changed back to Mill Creek in 1879. In 1902, the town of Mill Creek incorporated in Indian Territory, and after statehood, became Mill Creek, Oklahoma, on November 16, 1907.

The town&#x27;s history is closely linked to the railroad. The St. Louis, Oklahoma, and Southern Railway laid tracks through the Mill Creek area from 1900 to 1901. However, the tracks were approximately east of town, so many residents moved closer to the railroad. Soon, the town became one of the largest shipping points for cattle in the region.

The population peaked in 1907, at 644.

About 23.4% of families and 28.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 43.0% of those under age 18 and 20.5% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==
According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, the main economic activity now is extraction of gravel and granite. The granite is noted for its pink color and is marketed under the trade name &quot;Autumn Rose.&quot;

==Notable people==
Cyrus Harris (1817-1888), was a native of Mississippi but moved to Mill Creek in 1855. He became the first governor of the Chickasaw Nation and was re-elected to the position four more times. He made his home near the present town of Mill Creek and was buried in Old Mill Creek Cemetery.

Jess Larson, 1st Administrator of General Services, the administrator of the War Assets Administration, and as chairman and president of the Air Force Association, was born in Mill Creek in 1904.

<doc id="130280" wikidata="Q7502047" url="?curid=130280" title="Short five lemma">
<text>In mathematics, especially homological algebra and other applications of abelian category theory, the short five lemma is a special case of the five lemma.
It states that for the following commutative diagram (in any abelian category, or in the category of groups), if the rows are short exact sequences, and if &quot;g&quot; and &quot;h&quot; are isomorphisms, then &quot;f&quot; is an isomorphism as well.

It follows immediately from the five lemma.

The essence of the lemma can be summarized as follows: if you have a homomorphism &quot;f&quot; from an object &quot;B&quot; to an object &#x27;, and this homomorphism induces an isomorphism from a subobject &quot;A&quot; of &quot;B&quot; to a subobject&#x27; of &#x27; and also an isomorphism from the factor object &quot;B&quot;/&quot;A&quot; to&#x27;/&#x27;, then &quot;f&quot; itself is an isomorphism. Note however that the existence of &quot;f&quot; (such that the diagram commutes) has to be assumed from the start; two objects &quot;B&quot; and&#x27; that simply have isomorphic sub- and factor objects need not themselves be isomorphic (for example, in the category of abelian groups, &quot;B&quot; could be the cyclic group of order four and &quot;&quot; the Klein four-group).

<text>Tishomingo is the largest city in, and the county seat of, Johnston County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 3,101 as of the 2020 census, an increase of 2.2% over the population of 3,034 reported at the 2010 census. It was the first capital of the Chickasaw Nation, from 1856 until Oklahoma statehood in 1907. The city is home to Murray State College, a community college with an annual enrollment of 3,000 students. Tishomingo is part of the Texoma region.

==History==
Tishomingo was named for &quot;Tishomingo&quot;, who died of smallpox on the Trail of Tears near Little Rock, Arkansas, after the Chickasaw had been removed in the 1830s from their original homelands in and around Tishomingo, Mississippi.

Before the founding of Tishomingo in 1852, the area was known as &quot;Good Springs&quot;. Its several springs made the area an attractive campsite along the road between Fort Washita and Fort Arbuckle. A small town had developed that replaced the old campsites with permanent structures and was renamed &quot;Tishomingo&quot; by 1856. That year it was designated as the Chickasaw capital. A post office was established in 1857.

The Chickasaw Capitol Building was constructed in 1897 from local red granite and officially dedicated in 1898. It housed the tribal governor, the bicameral legislature, and other government officials and clerks. The territorial court also met there from time to time. 

The territorial government was dissolved at statehood. In 1910, the building was sold to the newly established Johnston County, organized under statehood. It was taken for use as the county court house.

The Western Oklahoma Railroad was built from Haileyville to Ardmore via Tishomingo in 1902, and bought by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway in the same year. It was abandoned in 1938.

<doc id="130284" wikidata="Q2950210" url="?curid=130284" title="Blackwell, Oklahoma">
<text>Blackwell is a city in Kay County, Oklahoma, United States, located at the intersection of U.S. Highway 177 and State Highway 11 along Interstate 35 (exit #222). The population was 6,085 as of the 2020 census. Blackwell was established following the September 16, 1893 Cherokee Outlet land run by A. J. Blackwell. Blackwell has an agricultural and fossil fuel based economy.

==History==

===Founding===
Blackwell came into existence during the Cherokee Outlet Opening on September 16, 1893, in the run known as the Cherokee Strip Land Run. The town is named for A. J. Blackwell, who was the dominant force in its founding. Andrew Blackwell had settled in the area in 1882, having married the former Rosa Vaught who was of Cherokee descent, he was eligible to found the city. Blackwell served as Justice of the Peace and Mayor of Blackwell.

Blackwell&#x27;s first school opened in September 1893 in a small, frame building with fifty-two students in attendance. A gradual enrollment increase created a need for ten teachers by 1899.

A post office was established on December 1, 1893. Due to a struggle for regional prominence between Blackwell and nearby Parker, the post office was named Parker from April 2, 1894, to February 4, 1895. After that, the name reverted to Blackwell.

Prior to the Civil Rights Movement Blackwell had a reputation as a sundown town, having kept out African Americans through violent expulsion and the display of a sign warning them to leave town by sunset. Blackwell&#x27;s expulsion of its African-American residents around 1893 is described in the 1967 book &quot;From Slavery to Freedom&quot; by John Hope Franklin.

===Zinc smelter===

The Blackwell Zinc Company smelter first began operations in 1917. In 1974, the 80-acre Blackwell Zinc Smelter facility ceased operations. At the time, it was the city&#x27;s largest employer, employing 800 people in 1972, and over 1,000 at its peak. It also was one of the largest zinc smelter facilities in the United States. After its closure the land was donated to the Blackwell Industrial Authority (BIA). Soil from the land was repurposed throughout the city, leading to widespread contamination of air and water, including the Chikaskia River. One of the plant&#x27;s two Corliss stationary steam engines was moved to Pawnee Oklahoma and preserved; this engine is run for viewing by the public on the first weekend of May.

The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality has been overseeing remediation of contamination at the industrial park, groundwater, and soil throughout parts of the city since 1992. Phelps Dodge Corporation, a subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc, has owned the site since 1999. On October 15, 2009, the City of Blackwell filed suit against Freeport-McMoRan calling the contamination a nuisance, and alleging that 58 million pounds of toxic waste remained in the city, causing illness within its 7,200 residents. Following several changes of venue between Federal court and Kay County courts, the City of Blackwell and Freeport settled for 54-million dollars on February 4, 2010.

===1955 F5 tornado===

Blackwell was a victim of the 1955 Great Plains tornado outbreak, a deadly tornado outbreak that struck the southern and central U.S Great Plains States on May 25–26, 1955. It produced at least 46 tornadoes across seven states including two F5 tornadoes in Blackwell, Oklahoma, and Udall, Kansas. The outbreak killed 102 from three tornadoes while injuring hundreds more. Unusual electromagnetic activity was observed, including St. Elmo&#x27;s fire.

The Blackwell tornado formed in Noble County at around 9:00pm CDT before crossing through the eastern portions of the Kay County town of Blackwell as an F5 wedge tornado. Then about wide (Grazulis 1991), It claimed the lives of 20 people in Blackwell and injured over 200 before crossing into and dissipating over Cowley County, Kansas. Along with destroying nearly 200 homes, the tornado demolished two of the town&#x27;s main employers, the Acme Foundry and the Hazel Atlas Glass plant. Four hundred homes were destroyed or swept away, and 500 other homes were damaged. Sixty businesses were also destroyed and the local hospital sustained major damage. Most of the western half of the town was spared the worst of the damage.

To commemorate the 1955 tornado, the Top of Oklahoma Historical Society Museum housed in the 1912 Electric Park Pavilion in Blackwell put on a special exhibition &quot;F5 in 1955&quot; which included a ‘tornado room’ which displayed artifacts, information, and photographs of the event. Over a year in the making, the exhibit occupied an entire room and was made possible with financial support from the city of Blackwell. “Working with the wonderful people at the Top of Oklahoma Museum and the Udall Historical Society was the best part of the creation of the “F5 in 1955” exhibit,&quot; said Dianne Braden, tornado survivor. &quot;To commemorate the event and the loss of 107 people was important to all of us. There’s something for every age in the exhibit.”

==Geography==
Blackwell is located along the Chikaskia River and to the east of Interstate 35. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and 0.18% is water.

===Climate===

On May 25, 1955, a deadly F5 tornado, part of the 1955 Great Plains tornado outbreak, struck Blackwell at approximately 9:30pm and cut a swath of destruction through the northeastern portion of the city, roughly centered in the neighborhoods surrounding Riverside Park. 20 residents died and over 250 were injured. The tornado outbreak included another F5 tornado that struck Udall, Kansas killing 80 people and injuring over 270. The outbreak spawned 19 tornadoes across Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas alone.

== Sports ==
In 2023, The Pecos League announced that a new baseball team will be put in Blackwell, The Blackwell Fly Catchers.

==Government==
The City of Blackwell is a Dillon&#x27;s rule Charter City, which is governed by a Council-Manager form of government. As such, executive duties are carried out by the City Manager on behalf of the City Council. 

The Blackwell City Council currently consists of Richard Braden, representing Ward 1; Karey Henderson, representing Ward 2; Scott Moen, representing Ward 3; and Todd Murphy, representing Ward 4; and Pat Hullet holding the current position of Mayor.

The current City Manager is Jerry Wieland. The Chief of Police is Jay Brewer and the Fire Chief is Cordell Hanebrink.

=== Blackwell City Council ===
The Blackwell City Council currently consists of five electors holding three-year terms (or until their successors are elected and qualified.) Four of the council members represent their individual ward in which they reside for the entire term of their office, and which represents roughly one quarter of the city&#x27;s population. The fifth member of the council, the mayor, is elected without regard to residency in any particular ward. The mayor serves as the chairperson of the city council. Each member of the city council is required to have residence in Blackwell for one calendar year prior to their election and must remain a resident through their term or vacate their position; and must be at least 25 at the time of the election. Each year, the City Council elects a vice-mayor among themselves who will fill the duties and obligations of the mayor in the mayor&#x27;s absence or disqualification.

Vacancies occur when a councilor becomes ineligible to hold their position, resigns, or passes away. If a council position becomes vacant, the remaining council members will appoint a qualified elector for the remainder of the position&#x27;s term. Ward councilor positions are considered vacant when the representing councilor moves outside of the electing ward&#x27;s boundaries, with an exception that a change in boundaries does not disqualify a councilor from completing their term for which they were elected.

==Education==
The Blackwell School District consists of Blackwell Elementary, Blackwell Middle School, and Blackwell High School. As recently as 2017 Huston, Northside, Parkside, and Washington Elementary Schools were used for Pre-K through 5th grade classes. The former school sites are all listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Blackwell&#x27;s school mascot is the Maroon Spirit, which was memorialized in the Maroon Park on Main Street with a mural painted by the Blackwell High School art class depicting the Maroon Spirit with the names of the seniors given the title of &quot;Maroon Spirit&quot; and &quot;Miss BHS&quot; dating back to the early 1900s. Historically, Oklahoma Baptist College served the city&#x27;s higher education needs between 1901 and 1913.

==Media==

Blackwell&#x27;s local paper is the Blackwell Journal-Tribune. A local radio station KOKB 1580 AM, used to broadcast local sports as well as Northern Oklahoma College&#x27;s KAYE and the Ponca City-based KLOR.

==Infrastructure==
Blackwell has a full-service city government, that includes, electricity, water, sewage, recreation, police and fire services. The police department has 17 full-time officers, a jail and operates 24 hours per day. The Blackwell Fire Department is a full-time fire department, staffed with 20 paid firefighters/EMT/Paramedics and also provides ambulance service to Blackwell and the surrounding communities.

===Transportation===
Blackwell is served by Interstate 35, US Route 177, and Oklahoma State Highway 11.

Blackwell is home to the Blackwell-Tonkawa Municipal Airport with neighboring Tonkawa, Oklahoma.

Historically, Blackwell had multiple rail lines, including the Blackwell and Southern Railway built south from Braman through town to Tonkawa, and the Hutchinson and Southern Railway built east from Medford through town to Ponca City, both lines being acquired by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway by 1900. The town also was linked by the Blackwell, Enid and Southwestern Railway, later acquired by what became the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway, which was built southwest from town to Enid and beyond. Rail abandonments have since occurred, but Blackwell continues to have freight rail service through the Blackwell Northern Gateway Railroad.

===Healthcare===

<text>Kaw City is a city in eastern Kay County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 325 as of the 2020 United States census. Kaw City was named for the Kanza Indians, called &quot;the Kaw&quot; by locals.

==History==
In 1902, the original Kaw City was founded, prior to Oklahoma statehood, as a farming community in the fertile oxbow bend of the Arkansas River. Kaw City was across the river from the Kaw Indian reservation and the Kaw Agency. By statehood in 1907, it had 486 inhabitants. Although the original town site is now inundated by the waters of Kaw Lake, the old town was quite a busy place.

It became a booming oil town in 1919, when &#x27;black gold&#x27; was discovered in nearby Kay County and the present Osage Nation reservation. The population jumped from 627 in 1920 to 1,001 in 1930. It even had a very popular four-story hotel filled with one of the world&#x27;s rarest art collections. Laura A. Clubb, owner of the collection and wife of a local rancher, later donated her collection to Philbrook Art Museum.

The majority of the town was overcome by a (weather-related) flood in 1923, and then devastated again by the Great Depression.

In the late 1960s, the Army Corps of Engineers constructed Kaw Dam on the Arkansas River just south of the original Kaw City site. It then went underwater permanently in 1976, when the gates of the Kaw Dam closed and turned that particular area of the Arkansas River into Kaw Lake. Dave Morgan, a banker and oilman in nearby Blackwell, Oklahoma loaned the town the money it needed to move two miles to the west, up on a hill by the town&#x27;s cemetery. The first house was built in the summer of 1969 and first mail delivery was on June 26, 1972. Many buildings in Kaw City, including the old Santa Fe Railroad Depot which is now the Kaw City Museum, were moved to the town&#x27;s present location, on high ground near the lake. The Santa Fe Railroad Depot is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The depot is one of only two listed structures that have been moved from their original locations elsewhere in Oklahoma, the other being Will Rogers Homestead near Claremore, which was also moved to make way for a lake. When the water in the lake is exceptionally low, some of the foundations of the old structures can still be seen just above the water.

The Kaw City Cemetery (all headstones and the majority of the caskets) were also moved and given a separate section within Ponca City&#x27;s IOOF cemetery, west of Conoco just south of Highway 60. The Kaw Indian cemetery located across the Arkansas river in Washunga was moved to Newkirk, Oklahoma.

<text>Kildare is a town in Kay County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 100 at the 2010 census, an 8.7 percent increase from the figure of 92 in 2000.

==History==
According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad built a section house, agent&#x27;s cottage, a tool house and a depot at the future site of Kildare in 1892, a year before the opening of the Cherokee Outlet to settlers.

The railroad said it sold eight thousand tickets to Kildare for September 16, 1893, the opening day of the Cherokee Strip land run. Kildare boomed almost overnight. A post office was established on October 24, 1893. The town was incorporated by the Territorial Legislature on March 2, 1905. However, the lack of water limited its future. The highest population ever recorded in the U. S. census was 216 in 1910. Three times fires destroyed the business district, and fewer businesses rebuilt each time.

It was named after County Kildare in Ireland.

<text>Newkirk is a city in and the county seat of Kay County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 2,172 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Newkirk is on land known as the Cherokee Outlet (popularly called the &quot;Cherokee Strip&quot;), which belonged to the Cherokee Indians until 1893. The Cherokee acquiesced to the demand of the president and Department of the Interior to sell the land, then part of Oklahoma Territory, to the U.S. government. Efforts to buy the land from the Cherokee began in 1889, but were not concluded until 1893 when Congress authorized the purchase and the land was opened to non-Indian settlement by means of the Cherokee Strip Land Run on September 16, 1893. An estimated 100,000 people raced to claim plots of land.

The town of Newkirk had been laid out before the run by the government as the county seat of “K” county. It was named Lamoreaux after Silas W. Lamoreaux, who was commissioner of the General Land Office. Two miles north of Lamoreaux was Kirk, a Santa Fe Railroad cattle-shipping station.

That first day of the land run, 5,000 people staked claims in and near Lamoreaux. Claimants were allowed two town lots: one for a home and one for a business. In designated rural areas, claimants could select 160 acres. The population quickly dropped to about 2,100 as disappointed land seekers left. A town government was organized and among the first items of business was to change the name of the town from Lamoreaux to Santa Fe, but the railroad rejected the name as several other places were named Santa Fe. Meanwhile, the railroad station at Kirk had been closed, so the name Newkirk was chosen on November 8, 1893.

In 1901, Newkirk suffered a major reversal when nearly a whole block of its thriving downtown burned. The wooden buildings that burned were mostly replaced with stone buildings from the distinctive yellow limestone quarried four miles east of Newkirk. &quot;Imposing stone buildings began to give dignity and permanence to the dusty streets, while wood-frame homes gradually replaced the &#x27;proving-up&#x27; homes of the Run. Young Elms, Cottonwoods, shrubs, and flowers began to change the once treeless prairies into shaded garden spots.&quot; Newkirk&#x27;s business district was placed on the National Register as a historic district in 1984.

After Oklahoma became a state in 1907, Newkirk, Blackwell, and Ponca City vied to become the county seat. An election on September 3, 1908, gave Blackwell 2,038 votes, Newkirk 2,063, and Ponca City 1,388. Governor Haskell declared Newkirk the winner. Blackwell sued, but lost, and Newkirk retained the title. The present Kay County courthouse was built in 1926, replacing the original 1894 wooden structure that had burned.

In 1992, Newkirk became the first small town to receive the Oklahoma Main Street Award. Newkirk was also the name of the town in the movie &quot;Twister&quot;&#x27;s drive-in movie scene took place, though it was filmed in Guthrie, Oklahoma.

The Kay County Courthouse in Newkirk was constructed in 1925 -1926, and at almost 100 years of age the original courthouse had many problems that were addressed by a new annex announced by the Kay County Board of Commissioners in 2020. Some of those problems included a leaking roof, electrical and plumbing problems, as well as a lack of space for the district court system. To expand the court system, all other county offices were relocated to the Annex, leaving the Courthouse only for the court system.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , all land.

Newkirk is on mostly flat terrain with no large watercourses nearby, and at the boundary between two ecoregions: the Central Great Plains and the Flint Hills. West of the town on the Great Plains, the countryside is rich agricultural land, especially for wheat, soybeans, and cattle. East of town, the Flint Hills&#x27; terrain is more rugged and rocky and is primarily used for cattle ranching. Natural vegetation is mostly prairie, but stream valleys often have forests of cottonwood, oak, elm, ash, pecan, sycamore, and other species. Scrub oak and red cedar dot hillsides. Wildlife is abundant, including whitetail deer, turkey, bobwhite quail, coyote, bobcat, and waterfowl. A cougar attack on a person seven miles (11 km) east of Newkirk was reported in 2002.

Newkirk lies south of the Kansas-Oklahoma border. A casino and other facilities owned by the Kaw Indian tribe are east. The Arkansas River is east of town. The bridge across the river crosses the upper end of Kaw Lake. Near the river are the Deer Creek/Bryson Paddock sites, where archeologists excavated the ruins of two prominent 18th-century Wichita Indian villages. Beyond the river, continuing east, is the lightly populated, tallgrass prairie region with many large ranches. Locals call this region “The Osage” after Osage County and the Osage Indians. The Washunga cemetery of the Kaw Indians is north of Newkirk. It was moved there to avoid having it covered by water when a dam created Kaw Lake. The Chilocco Indian Agricultural School, now closed, was north.

===Climate===
Newkirk&#x27;s climate can be described as extreme continental, with an average low temperature in January of 20 °F (-7 °C) and an average high temperature in July of 92 °F (33 °C).

<text>Tonkawa is a city in Kay County, Oklahoma, United States, along the Salt Fork Arkansas River. The population was 3,015 as of the 2020 United States census.

==History==
Named after the Tonkawa tribe, the city of Tonkawa was founded in March 1894 by Eli V. Blake and Wiley William Gregory. Blake and Gregory, originally from Kansas, claimed the land that would become Tonkawa in the Land Run of 1893. Prior to the land run, from 1879 to 1885, the area was known as &quot;Fort Oakland&quot;, home to the Nez Perce people. In 1885, the remnants of the Tonkawa tribe, who had fled Indian Territory after the 1862 Tonkawa Massacre, returned to settle in the Fort Oakland area. The Blackwell and Southern Railway (later bought by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway) built a line through Tonkawa, which stimulated growth of the town. In 1901, the Oklahoma Territory Legislature established the University Preparatory School (now Northern Oklahoma College) here. By statehood, the population was 1,238. The discovery of oil caused a boom in the 1920s, and the population was 3,311 in 1930.

===Camp Tonkawa===
During World War II, Tonkawa was home to Camp Tonkawa, a prisoner-of-war camp. Camp Tonkawa remained in operation from August 30, 1943, to September 1, 1945. Built between October and December 1942, the site contained more than 180 wooden structures for 3,000 German POWs as well as 500 U.S. Army guard troops, service personnel and civilian employees. The first prisoners, consisting of German troops from the Afrika Korps, arrived in August 1943. During their internment, prisoners labored at local farms and ranches. In November 1943, a prison riot caused the death of a German soldier, Johannes Kunze. Eight prisoners briefly escaped, only to be recaptured.

<text>Dover is a town in Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 464 at the 2010 census. a 26.4 percent gain over the figure of 367 in 2000.

==History==
The area around Dover was ideal for cattle grazing, By 1884, all the land had been leased to cattlemen. The Red Fork Traders&#x27; Ranch had been established near the Chisholm Trail. The land was opened for settlement by the Land Run of 1889, and the trading post was well-placed to benefit from the farmers that settled nearby.

The Rock Island built a track through the Traders&#x27; Ranch and constructed abridge across the Cimarron River in October 1889. A settlement called Red Wing grew up around the ranch. In 1890, a post office designated &quot;Dover&quot; was established, and the community took that name. By 1893, the community had an estimated 150 residents, growing to about 500 by 1910.

Dover was the site on April 3, 1895, where the outlaw gang known as the Wild Bunch held up a Rock Island train. The gang was unable to open the safe containing $50,000 in army payroll, so they robbed the passengers instead. A posse surprised and scattered the gang around noon. Thus Dover has the distinction of being the place of the last robbery by the Wild Bunch as a gang, although its individual members kept up the robberies and killings until their own demises.

On September 18, 1906, a bridge across the Cimarron River near Dover collapsed beneath a Rock Island train bound for Fort Worth, Texas from Chicago. The bridge was a temporary structure unable to withstand the pressure of debris and high water. Replacement with a permanent structure had been delayed by the railroad for financial reasons. Several sources report that over 100 persons were killed, although this figure is disputed. The true number may be as low as 4.

A tornado in May 1999 destroyed about one-third of the town, killing one.

<text>Hennessey is a town in Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 2,131 at the 2010 census, up from 2,058 in 2000.

==History==

Hennessey is named after Pat Hennessey, an Irish freighter who was killed at the present townsite in April 1874. He was said to have been burned on a wagon wheel, either by native Cheyenne tribesmen or white horse thieves.

The Pat Hennessey Memorial Park can be found at Iowa and Arapaho streets. The location of his body is another story. Pat Hennessey was originally buried next to the location of his death in a shallow grave. Rocks were placed over his body, and teamsters passing by would continue to place markers on his grave. At some point in history Hennessey&#x27;s body was moved. It is possible his relatives came from Ireland and reclaimed his body. In any case, it is not at the marker site at Memorial Park: excavations there produced no remains.

The town was laid out by the Hennessey Townsite Company after the land run of April 22, 1889. The Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway, which was owned by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, built a line from Kansas through the Cherokee Outlet, and the first train arrived in September 1889. The town was incorporated on June 10, 1890.

Hennessey is the home town of former NFL fullback Leon Crosswhite and actor Nicki Aycox.

==Geography==
Hennessey is located in northern Kingfisher County on the Chisholm Trail, the historic cattle trail on which is based today&#x27;s U.S. Route 81. US 81 leads south to Kingfisher, the county seat, and north to Enid. Oklahoma State Highway 51 passes through the north side of the town, leading east to Stillwater and west to Okeene.

<text>Kingfisher is a city in and the county seat of Kingfisher County, Oklahoma. The population was 4,903 at the time of the 2020 census. It is the former home and namesake of Kingfisher College. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, Kingfisher is now primarily a bedroom community for people employed in Enid and Oklahoma City.

==History==
===19th century===
Kingfisher came into existence on April 22, 1889, when land owned by the federal government was opened to settlement by &quot;land run&quot;. A huge area in what is now central Oklahoma was literally &quot;peopled&quot; by non-Native Americans overnight. The city is situated on a part of the Chisholm Trail, over which millions of Texas longhorns were driven to railheads in Kansas in the years immediately following the Civil War. Extension of the railroads and settlement of the open range ended this colorful era.

The town was named for an early resident who several landmarks were named for, a man named King Fisher.

The bill that opened Oklahoma Territory to non-Indian settlement limited the sizes of townsites to . Settlers in the Kingfisher area formed two communities: Kingfisher City, on the north side of the settlement, and Lisbon, on the south side. The two merged on June 14, 1890, and the resulting town was named Kingfisher. Oklahoma Territory was organized May 2, 1890, and consisted of the Unassigned Lands and the Panhandle. The Western District included present-day Kingfisher County, part of Canadian County and the Panhandle. Abraham Jefferson Seay, a Missouri native, was appointed as District Judge and moved to Kingfisher. In 1892, Seay was appointed as the second territorial governor by President Benjamin Harrison.

Railroads helped with Kingfisher’s growth: the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway (later part of the Rock Island) built through the area, the first passenger train arriving on October 23, 1889.

A newspaper was published in Kingfisher from 1889 to 1963 under the names &quot;Kingfisher Free Press&quot;, &quot;The New World&quot;, &quot;Kingfisher Weekly Free Press&quot;, and &quot;Kingfisher Weekly Star and Free Press&quot;.

===20th century===
The Coleman Company was founded in Kingfisher by W. C. Coleman in 1900.

In 1900, the Guthrie and Kingfisher Railway -- also later part of the Rock Island-- built east from Kingfisher, while the Guthrie and Western Railway-- an affiliate of the Santa Fe Railroad-- built west from Seward, Oklahoma, meeting at a point that became Cashion, Oklahoma, and giving Kingfisher access to the territorial capitol of Guthrie and the Santa Fe system. The Kingfisher to Seward line was abandoned in pieces in 1934 and 1937, but Kingfisher still has freight rail service on what is now the Union Pacific Railroad.

The Kingfisher County Development Foundation was created in 1958 for the purpose of assisting and promoting industrial, economic and civic growth within, and surrounding the Kingfisher area of Oklahoma.A present K.C.D.F. strategy includes the investment for development of the Kingfisher Industrial Park. The industrial park is located just south of Kingfisher, further closing the gap between Oklahoma City and Kingfisher. Kingfisher has quickly become a suburban community of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Statistical Area, already home to many commuters to Oklahoma City. Kingfisher is a Certified City and has received a Community Development Block Grant to inventory infrastructure features for Capital Improvement Planning (CIP).

===21st century===
On August 19, 2007, the city was 25% flooded when Kingfisher Creek and Uncle John Creek overflowed their banks, the result of heavy rain from Tropical Depression Erin. One woman died in the flood.

==Geography==
Kingfisher is located south-central Kingfisher County northwest of Oklahoma City. U.S. Route 81 (Main Street) passes through the center of town, leading north to Enid and south to El Reno. Oklahoma State Highway 3 (Broadway Avenue) crosses US 81 in the center of town, leading east to Guthrie and west to Watonga.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Kingfisher has a total area of , of which , or 1.21%, are water. The city is drained by Kingfisher Creek, a northeast-flowing tributary of the Cimarron River.

In February 1902, the town that had sprung up around the trading post and changed its name to Mountain Park. Fires destroyed most of the wood-frame buildings along Main Street in 1906 and 1908. The town rebuilt with all brick structures.

According to &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, the Oklahoma City and Western Railroad offered Mountain Park resident Sol Bracken six thousand dollars for a tract on which to build a station. Bracken refused the offer as insufficient and demanded more money. Instead, company officials rerouted their railroad through the town of Snyder, two miles south of Mountain Park. As a result, 41 of the 47 businesses in Mountain Park promptly moved to Snyder.

By statehood in 1907, Mountain Park had 381 residents. In 1910, it was named the county seat of the short-lived Swanson County. That county was abolished in the following year. The local economy was based on cotton and wheat production, as well as granite quarrying. The population rose to 459 by 1930. Census population peaked at 557 in 1980.

On March 7, 2008, KSWO-TV reported that the former town clerk was fired for allegedly secretly embezzling $100,000 over a period of two years, leaving the town unable to pay its bills and forcing it to raise utility rates for residents.

==History==
The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (Rock Island) extended a line from Chickasha to the northern part of the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Reservation in 1899. It terminated about two miles from an existing tent city called Oakdale, consisting of a store and post office on the former Cheyenne and Arapaho Reservation. The Oakdale post office was renamed Mountain View, honoring the nearby Wichita Mountains, on October 9, 1900.

In 1903, the entire town relocated to a site closer to the railroad. The move was completed in 1904. Nicknaming itself &quot;the City in the Woods,&quot; the town became a point for transshipping Texas cattle on the Rock Island. Cattle were unloaded from trains and allowed to graze on Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Reservation land before resuming their journey to markets. By 1910, the town had a population of 855.

<text>Red Oak is a town in Latimer County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 537 at the 2020 Census.

== History ==
The area around Red Oak has been inhabited since approximately 9,000 BCE, beginning with people of the Fourche Maline Culture who were descended from the first Native Americans to migrate from Asia via the Bering Land Bridge. Archaeological sites such as the McCutchan-McLaughlin site in southeastern Latimer County provide evidence of Fourche Maline settlements, particularly the burial mounds used by these people groups. The combination of poor health and prolonged drought led to the extinction of the Fourche Maline cultures by the early 15th century. European explorers, including Francisco Vasquez de Coronado and Jean Baptiste Bernard de la Harpe, began arriving in the mid-16th century and found only scattered remains of these once thriving cultures.

Red Oak became an area of settlement for members of the Choctaw tribe during relocation as part of the Trail of Tears beginning in the 1830s. In 1858, English immigrant Thomas Edwards married Choctaw native Nancy Hardaway and together they established Edwards Store on Hardaway&#x27;s land on the Butterfield Overland Mail Route. Adhering to Choctaw tradition in naming sites after people or prominent features, the community that arose around their store became known as &quot;Red Oak,&quot; after a large red oak tree in the area. Edwards Store became the first post office in Red Oak and was a successful merchantile for both the stage route and the growing community. At the time it was founded, Red Oak was located in the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

The arrival of the Choctaw Coal and Railway (later the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad, subsequently acquired by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway) nine miles southwest of Edwards Store led to the relocation of the town to its present site. With close proximity to the railroad, Red Oak became a thriving and prosperous community in the early 20th century. Some of the business structures from this era are still in existence, including the Red Oak Library (formerly the post office) and the buildings lining the Main Street business district such as Rustic Customs, Eagle Ridge Camp Store, and Fields Hardware.

The earliest schools were located in homes prior to 1900, with the first high school built in 1909. In 1921, Red Oak High School relocated from a brick building on the south side of town to a native sandstone building on the far north end of town. The two-story, pentagonal building is listed on the Oklahoma Historic Register and was followed in 1938 by a new elementary school (now Alice Savage Elementary) built by workers of the Works Progress Administration. The building was also constructed of native sandstone and consisted of nine classrooms and an auditorium/gymnasium. This building was replaced in 1950 with the current high school building (W.B. Rutledge High School). All three buildings are still in use and were renovated in the early 21st century through a series of bond issues.

<text>Bokoshe ( ) is a town in Le Flore County, Oklahoma, United States. It is part of the Fort Smith, Arkansas-Oklahoma metropolitan statistical area. &quot;Bokoshe&quot; is a Choctaw word meaning &quot;little creek&quot;. The population was 396 at the 2020 census, a 22.3% decrease over the figure of 510 recorded in 2010.

==History==

Bokoshe was a Choctaw settlement in 1886, when a post office was established, with William A. Sanner serving as the first Postmaster. At the time of its founding, Bokoshe was located in the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation. The principal business was a coal mine that employed 10 miners. By 1900, the population was 153. The Fort Smith and Western Railway built tracks in 1901 to this area to ship the coal elsewhere. The Midland Valley Railroad built its own line in 1903-1904. The town moved south from its initial location to the intersection of the two railroads. Two other coal mines soon opened nearby, and the population grew to 483 by 1910. By 1920, the census reported a population of 869.

Bokoshe&#x27;s mines fared better during the Great Depression than those elsewhere in the state. By 1930, the population had declined to 690, and continued dropping to 431 in 1960. The coal industry recovered and the town&#x27;s population rebounded to 588 in 1970, then fell again to 403 in 1990. The population was 450 in 2000 and 512 in 2010.

On February 1, 1958, the town was the location of a train collision on the Midland Valley Railroad. Westbound train 41 collided head-on with eastbound train 42 on the curve at Bokoshe.

<text>Cameron is a town in Le Flore County, Oklahoma, United States. It is part of the Fort Smith, Arkansas-Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 302 at the 2010 census, a decline of 3.2 percent from the figure of 312 recorded in 2000.

==History==
When the Fort Smith and Southern Railway laid tracks in the area of the present day town of Cameron in 1886–87, there was already a settlement of about 40 people. At the time of its founding, Cameron was located in Skullyville County, a part of the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation. The U. S. Post Office Department established a post office that it named Cameron, Indian Territory in 1888.
According to &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, the post office and town may have been named for either of two persons. One was William Cameron, a former Mine Inspector for Indian Territory. The other was James Cameron, an employee of the Fort Smith and Southern Railway.

In 1883, James Reynolds, a successful rancher and entrepreneur, established the Cameron Institute, which was sponsored by the Presbyterian Church but was open to enrolling students of any denomination. It educated children from primary to high school level. Reynolds became a resident of Cameron, where he built an imposing home, now known as the James E. Reynolds House, that had the appearance of a castle. The building is on the National Register of Historic Places listings in LeFlore County, Oklahoma.

<text>Cowlington is a town in LeFlore County, Oklahoma. It is part of the Fort Smith metropolitan area. The population was 155 at the time of the 2010 census, a gain of 16.5 percent over the figure of 133 recorded in 2000.

==History==
The fertile soil of the Arkansas River bottom land, in which the present town of Cowlington is located, attracted settlement as soon as the Choctaw tribe migrated to Indian Territory. Many of these inhabitants fled during the American Civil War, returning only when hostilities had ceased. White men also came after the war and began leasing land. Among these were Coke and Fowler Cowling. A settlement formed that was informally known as Short Mountain. A post office named Cowlington, to honor the Cowling family, opened in the community in 1884.

At the time of its founding, Cowlington was located in the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

Cowlington&#x27;s economy was largely based on agricultural services. Area production included wheat, potatoes, cotton, and livestock. The town prospered because of its access to the steamboat trade on the river. Two floods along the Arkansas River, in 1898 and 1904, devastated the local economy, but the town recovered each time. However, railroads built lines through LeFlore County in the late 1800s, and began to supplant the steamboats. Fowler Cowlington tried to convince some of the railroads to build a track through Cowlington, but failed in this effort. More residents began to move away. 

Construction of the Robert S. Kerr Lock and Dam between 1964 and 1970 coincided with a large increase in Cowlington&#x27;s population to a high of 751 residents at the 1970 U. S. Census. Tourism became a significant portion of the local economy, although the population declined again after construction was completed.

==Geography==
Cowlington is located south of Robert S. Kerr Lock and Dam (part of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System). The town is also south of Sallisaw.

<doc id="130308" wikidata="Q3287231" url="?curid=130308" title="Fort Coffee, Oklahoma">
<text>Fort Coffee is a town in Le Flore County, Oklahoma, United States. Originally constructed as a U. S. Army fort in 1834, it was named for U. S. General John Coffee, a veteran of the Seminole Wars. It is part of the Fort Smith, Arkansas-Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 424 at the 2010 census, a gain of 2.9 percent over the figure of 412 in 2000.

==History==
The town of Fort Coffee traces its beginnings to 1832, when the Choctaw Indian tribe was removed from the southeastern United States and transported to land in the eastern part of Indian Territory (now in the state of Oklahoma). Most of the travel was by water, and the site of Fort Coffee became a port on the Arkansas River.

In 1834, the Choctaw Nation petitioned the U.S. War Department to construct a fort that would stop the flow of alcohol and other illegal items from flowing into their territory along the Arkansas River. The garrison succeeded in its mission and also built roads connecting Fort Smith, Arkansas, Fort Gibson, and Fort Towson. The army abandoned Fort Coffee in 1838 when Fort Smith was reestablished. The site of Fort Coffee was located in Skullyville County, a part of the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

In 1843, the Choctaw nation allowed the Methodist Episcopal church to establish the Fort Coffee Choctaw Boys Academy in the buildings. This school continued until the outbreak of the Civil War, when Confederate forces commanded by General Stand Watie occupied the site. The Union Army recaptured the fort in 1863. Most of the buildings were burned during this time. Several small houses were built using the foundation stones.

The Choctaw were required to release their slaves by the Reconstruction Treaty of 1866. Many of the freed men remained in the Choctaw Nation lands. Many of these were legally adopted into the Choctaw Nation in 1885, thus qualifying for land allotments by the Dawes Commission.

The local economy has largely been based on agriculture. Major crops included cotton, livestock and soybeans. There was a cotton gin in Fort Coffee to handle locally grown crops. The Fort Smith and Western Railroad and the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railway (bought by the Kansas City Southern Railway in 1900) transported the products to outside markets.

The town of Fort Coffee did not incorporate until 1998.

<text>Heavener is a town in Le Flore County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 3,414 at the 2010 census, an increase of 6.7 percent from 3,201 at the 2000 census. Heavener is notable for the Heavener Runestone just outside the city limits.

==History==
Joseph H. Heavener and some other white settlers arrived, secured permits to farm from the Chocktaw Indians, and settled down to farm. In 1880, Zachary Taylor Ward and his Choctaw wife, Tabitha Hickman Ward, moved their store from Skullyville to the present site of Heavener. Ward died in 1883, and his widow, Tabitha, married Heavener. The couple owned the land on which the town was established. Before being named Heavener by a popular vote in 1895, the area was known by several different names, including Prairie of the Tall Grass, Choctaw City, Prairie View, Long Prairie, and Grand Prairie.

At the time of its founding, and through Oklahoma&#x27;s statehood in 1907, Heavener was located in Sugar Loaf County, one of the counties making up the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

Suitable agricultural land around Heavener attracted many farmers as settlers. Other improvements soon followed. A cotton gin and a grist mill were built in the town in 1885. In 1896 the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad built tracks through the town. A post office was established in a boxcar on May 12, 1896, while another boxcar became the train station. In 1900-1901 a predecessor of the Arkansas Western Railroad constructed tracks from Heavener east into Arkansas.

The Curtis Act allowed Heavener to incorporate in Indian Territory in 1898; Henry Moore was elected as the first mayor. The town population was 254 in 1900 when the Kansas City Southern Railway purchased the rail line. The company established a roundhouse in 1910, making Heavener a division point. By 1910, the population was 780, and continued increasing to 1,850 by 1920.

Mining and timber came to the local economy in the 1930s. The 1930 census showed the population to be 2,269. The Burnett Lumber Company opened a sawmill in 1935. Then the population began declining: to 2,103 in 1950. Recovery began when the Heavener Charcoal Company began producing charcoal from its kilns in Heavener, shipping it to a plant in Arkansas. The 1970 census showed 2,566 residents in the town. However, the Burnett sawmill burned down in 1981.

Poultry farming became an important activity in the late 20th century. OK Foods established a hatchery in 1986. In 1992, the company built a poultry processing plant, followed by a poultry feed mill in 1995.

==Heavener Runestone==
Heavener is best known for the Heavener Runestone, just outside the city limits in Heavener Runestone Park. The cryptic stone appears to have letters from the runic alphabet, some people speculate that it was etched by pre-Columbian Norsemen.
Owing to this purported connection, Carl Albert State College in the nearby city of Poteau changed its mascot in the early 1990s from the &quot;Trojan&quot; to the &quot;Viking.&quot;

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.40%) is water.

==Media==
The small weekly newspaper, The Heavener Ledger, dated back to 1904 but ceased publication in 2014. The radio tower for KPRV FM radio sits on top of Poteau Mountain less than a half mile from the Runestone. KPRV broadcasts out of nearby Poteau and has a sister station with the same call letters on the AM band.

==Economy==
The CPKC railroad operates a major yard, crew base, and fueling facility in Heavener. It and its predecessors have been the town&#x27;s largest employers for over 70 years. The second largest employer in Heavener is OK Foods. Since 1988 this poultry company has operated a processing plant, a feed mill, and a hatchery.
==Schools==
All the schools, the sole educational facilities, are located in the city&#x27;s center. Heavener High School&#x27;s mascot is The Wolves. School colors are purple and gold. Main activities at the school include band, choir, football, cheerleading, basketball, baseball, softball, powerlifting, track, golf, soccer, drama, academic team, and jazz band.

The population was 802 at the 2010 census, a gain of 15.1 percent over the figure of 697 recorded in 2000. The town was once noted for producing coal and coke, but today is chiefly supported by agriculture.

==History==
This community was originally a Choctaw Nation town named Klondike. After the Kansas City, Pittsburgh and Gulf Railroad laid tracks through it in 1895-6, the residents renamed it for Dr. Herbert M. Howe, a railroad director. A post office opened at Howe, Indian Territory in 1898. The Kansas City Southern Railroad bought the Kansas City, Pittsburgh and Gulf Railroad in 1900.

At the time of its founding, the community was located in the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

Howe contained 626 residents in 1900, but the number declined to 538 by the 1910 census. It had grown again to 711 in 1920. The population began a long-term decline from 692 in 1930, to 640 in 1940 and to 390 in 1960. The town had its own newspaper, the &quot;Howe Herald&quot;, four doctors, four drugstores, a bank, two hotels and two cotton gins.

In 1961, an F4 tornado hit Howe and the neighboring village Reichert. The source calls the village Reichter, but the actual name is apparently Reichert. Some accounts even refer to the village as Richards. Sixteen people died, thirteen of them in Howe; fifty-eight were injured, fifty-seven in Howe; and at least fifty homes were destroyed. Despite this, Howe&#x27;s population trend reversed again. There were 562 residents in 1980, 697 in 2000 and 802 in 2010.

<text>A storm is any disturbed state of the natural environment or the atmosphere of an astronomical body. It may be marked by significant disruptions to normal conditions such as strong wind, tornadoes, hail, thunder and lightning (a thunderstorm), heavy precipitation (snowstorm, rainstorm), heavy freezing rain (ice storm), strong winds (tropical cyclone, windstorm), wind transporting some substance through the atmosphere such as in a dust storm, among other forms of severe weather.

Storms have the potential to harm lives and property via storm surge, heavy rain or snow causing flooding or road impassibility, lightning, wildfires, and vertical and horizontal wind shear. Systems with significant rainfall and duration help alleviate drought in places they move through. Heavy snowfall can allow special recreational activities to take place which would not be possible otherwise, such as skiing and snowmobiling.

The English word comes from Proto-Germanic &quot;*sturmaz&quot; meaning &quot;noise, tumult&quot;.

Storms are created when a center of low pressure develops with the system of high pressure surrounding it. This combination of opposing forces can create winds and result in the formation of storm clouds such as cumulonimbus. Small localized areas of low pressure can form from hot air rising off hot ground, resulting in smaller disturbances such as dust devils and whirlwinds.

== Types ==

There are many varieties and names for storms:

* Blizzard There are varying definitions for blizzards, both over time and by location. In general, a blizzard is accompanied by gale-force winds, heavy snow (accumulating at a rate of at least 5 centimeters (2 in) per hour), and very cold conditions (below approximately −10 degrees Celsius or 14 F). Lately, the temperature criterion has fallen out of the definition across the United States.
* Bomb cyclone A rapid deepening of a mid-latitude cyclonic low-pressure area, typically occurring over the ocean, but can occur over land. The winds experienced during these storms can be as powerful as that of a typhoon or hurricane.
* Coastal storm Large wind waves and/or storm surge that strike the coastal zone. Their impacts include coastal erosion and coastal flooding.
* Derecho A derecho is a widespread, long-lived, straight-line wind storm that is associated with a land-based, fast-moving group of severe thunderstorms.
* Dust devil A small, localized updraft of rising air.
* Dust storm A situation in which winds pick up large quantities of sand or soil, greatly reducing visibility.
* Firestorm Firestorms are conflagrations which attain such intensity that they create and sustain their own wind systems. It is most commonly a natural phenomenon, created during some of the largest bush fires, forest fires, and wildfires. The Peshtigo Fire is one example of a firestorm. Firestorms can also be deliberate effects of targeted explosives, such as occurred as a result of the aerial bombings of Dresden. Nuclear detonations generate firestorms if high winds are not present.
* Gale An extratropical storm with sustained winds between 34 and 48 knots (39–55 mph or 63–90 km/h).
* Hailstorm A type of storm that precipitates round chunks of ice. Hailstorms usually occur during regular thunderstorms. While most of the hail that precipitates from the clouds is fairly small and virtually harmless, there are occasional occurrences of hail greater than 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter that can cause much damage and injuries.
* Ice storm Ice storms are one of the most dangerous forms of winter storms. When surface temperatures are below freezing, but a thick layer of above-freezing air remains aloft, rain can fall into the freezing layer and freeze upon impact into a glaze of ice. In general, of accumulation is all that is required, especially in combination with breezy conditions, to start downing power lines as well as tree limbs. Ice storms also make unheated road surfaces too slick to drive upon. Ice storms can vary in time range from hours to days and can cripple small towns and large metropolitan cities alike.
* Microburst A very powerful windstorm produced during a thunderstorm that only lasts a few minutes.
* Ocean Storm or sea storm Storm conditions out at sea are defined as having sustained winds of 48 knots (55 mph or 90 km/h) or greater. Usually just referred to as a storm, these systems can sink vessels of all types and sizes.
* Nor&#x27;westers A powerful storm coming from North-western direction, associated with heavy gusts, hail and thunderstorms. Usually occurs in Eastern India and Bangladesh in the late Spring and early Summer.
* Snowstorm A heavy fall of snow accumulating at a rate of more than 5 centimeters (2 in) per hour that lasts several hours. Snow storms, especially ones with a high liquid equivalent and breezy conditions, can down tree limbs, cut off power connections and paralyze travel over large regions.
* Squall Sudden onset of wind increase of at least 16 knots (30 km/h) or greater sustained for at least one minute.
* Thunderstorm A thunderstorm is a type of storm that generates both lightning and thunder. It is normally accompanied by heavy precipitation. Thunderstorms occur throughout the world, with the highest frequency in tropical rainforest regions where there are conditions of high humidity and temperature along with atmospheric instability. These storms occur when high levels of condensation form in a volume of unstable air that generates deep, rapid, upward motion in the atmosphere. The heat energy creates powerful rising air currents that swirl upwards to the tropopause. Cool descending air currents produce strong downdraughts below the storm. After the storm has spent its energy, the rising currents die away and downdraughts break up the cloud. Individual storm clouds can measure 2–10 km across.
* Tornado A tornado is a violent, destructive whirlwind storm occurring on land. Usually its appearance is that of a dark, funnel-shaped cloud. Often tornadoes are preceded by or associated with thunderstorms and a wall cloud. They are often called the most destructive of storms, and while they form all over the planet, the interior of the United States is the most prone area, especially throughout Tornado Alley.
* Tropical cyclone A tropical cyclone is a storm system with a closed circulation around a centre of low pressure, fueled by the heat released when moist air rises and condenses. The name underscores its origin in the tropics and their cyclonic nature. Tropical cyclones are distinguished from other cyclonic storms such as nor&#x27;easters and polar lows by the heat mechanism that fuels them, which makes them &quot;warm core&quot; storm systems. Tropical cyclones form in the oceans if the conditions in the area are favorable, and depending on their strength and location, there are various terms by which they are called, such as &quot;tropical depression&quot;, &quot;tropical storm&quot;, &quot;hurricane&quot; and &quot;typhoon&quot;.
* Wind storm A storm marked by high wind with little or no precipitation. Windstorm damage often opens the door for massive amounts of water and debris to cause further damage to a structure. European windstorms and derechos are two type of windstorms. High wind is also the cause of sandstorms in dry climates.

== Classification ==
A strict meteorological definition of a terrestrial storm is a wind measuring 10 or higher on the Beaufort scale, meaning a wind speed of 24.5 m/s (89 km/h, 55 mph) or more; however, popular usage is not so restrictive. Storms can last anywhere from 12 to 200 hours, depending on season and geography. In North America, the east and northeast storms are noted for the most frequent repeatability and duration, especially during the cold period. Big terrestrial storms alter the oceanographic conditions that in turn may affect food abundance and distribution: strong currents, strong tides, increased siltation, change in water temperatures, overturn in the water column, etc. 
== Extraterrestrial storms ==
Storms do not only occur on Earth; other planetary bodies with a sufficient atmosphere (giant planets in particular) also undergo stormy weather. The Great Red Spot on Jupiter provides a well-known example. Though technically an anticyclone, with greater than hurricane wind speeds, it is larger than the Earth and has persisted for at least 340 years, having first been observed by astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini. Neptune also had its own lesser-known Great Dark Spot.

In September 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope – using Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 – imaged storms on Saturn generated by upwelling of warmer air, similar to a terrestrial thunderhead. The east–west extent of the same-year storm equaled the diameter of Earth. The storm was observed earlier in September 1990 and acquired the name Dragon Storm.

The dust storms of Mars vary in size, but can often cover the entire planet. They tend to occur when Mars comes closest to the Sun, and have been shown to increase the global temperature.

One particularly large Martian storm was exhaustively studied up close due to coincidental timing. When the first spacecraft to successfully orbit another planet, Mariner 9, arrived and successfully orbited Mars on 14 November 1971, planetary scientists were surprised to find the atmosphere was thick with a planet-wide robe of dust, the largest storm ever observed on Mars. The surface of the planet was totally obscured. Mariner 9&#x27;s computer was reprogrammed from Earth to delay imaging of the surface for a couple of months until the dust settled, however, the surface-obscured images contributed much to the collection of Mars atmospheric and planetary surface science.

Two extrasolar planets are known to have storms: HD 209458 b and HD 80606 b. The former&#x27;s storm was discovered on 23 June 2010, and measured at , while the latter produces winds of across the surface. The spin of the planet then creates giant swirling shock-wave storms that carry the heat aloft.

== Effects on human society ==


Shipwrecks are common with the passage of strong tropical cyclones. Such shipwrecks can change the course of history, as well as influence art and literature. A hurricane led to a victory of the Spanish over the French for control of Fort Caroline, and ultimately the Atlantic coast of North America, in 1565.
Strong winds from any storm type can damage or destroy vehicles, buildings, bridges, and other outside objects, turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles. In the United States, major hurricanes comprise just 21% of all landfalling tropical cyclones, but account for 83% of all damage. Tropical cyclones often knock out power to tens or hundreds of thousands of people, preventing vital communication and hampering rescue efforts. Tropical cyclones often destroy key bridges, overpasses, and roads, complicating efforts to transport food, clean water, and medicine to the areas that need it. Furthermore, the damage caused by tropical cyclones to buildings and dwellings can result in economic damage to a region, and to a diaspora of the population of the region.

The storm surge, or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone, is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones, historically resulting in 90% of tropical cyclone deaths. The relatively quick surge in sea level can move miles/kilometers inland, flooding homes and cutting off escape routes. The storm surges and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures, but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries, which are typically important fish breeding locales.

Cloud-to-ground lightning frequently occurs within the phenomena of thunderstorms and have numerous hazards towards landscapes and populations. One of the more significant hazards lightning can pose is the wildfires they are capable of igniting. Under a regime of low precipitation (LP) thunderstorms, where little precipitation is present, rainfall cannot prevent fires from starting when vegetation is dry as lightning produces a concentrated amount of extreme heat. Wildfires can devastate vegetation and the biodiversity of an ecosystem. Wildfires that occur close to urban environments can inflict damages upon infrastructures, buildings, crops, and provide risks to explosions, should the flames be exposed to gas pipes. Direct damage caused by lightning strikes occurs on occasion. In areas with a high frequency for cloud-to-ground lightning, like Florida, lightning causes several fatalities per year, most commonly to people working outside.

Precipitation with low potential of hydrogen levels (pH), otherwise known as acid rain, is also a frequent risk produced by lightning. Distilled water, which contains no carbon dioxide, has a neutral pH of 7. Liquids with a pH less than 7 are acidic, and those with a pH greater than 7 are bases. &quot;Clean&quot; or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic pH of about 5.2, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid, a weak acid (pH 5.6 in distilled water), but unpolluted rain also contains other chemicals. Nitric oxide present during thunderstorm phenomena, caused by the splitting of nitrogen molecules, can result in the production of acid rain, if nitric oxide forms compounds with the water molecules in precipitation, thus creating acid rain. Acid rain can damage infrastructures containing calcite or other solid chemical compounds containing carbon. In ecosystems, acid rain can dissolve plant tissues of vegetations and increase acidification process in bodies of water and in soil, resulting in deaths of marine and terrestrial organisms.

Hail damage to roofs often goes unnoticed until further structural damage is seen, such as leaks or cracks. It is hardest to recognize hail damage on shingled roofs and flat roofs, but all roofs have their own hail damage detection problems. Metal roofs are fairly resistant to hail damage, but may accumulate cosmetic damage in the form of dents and damaged coatings. Hail is also a common nuisance to drivers of automobiles, severely denting the vehicle and cracking or even shattering windshields and windows. Rarely, massive hailstones have been known to cause concussions or fatal head trauma. Hailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history. One of the earliest recorded incidents occurred around the 9th century in Roopkund, Uttarakhand, India. The largest hailstone in terms of diameter and weight ever recorded in the United States fell on 23 July 2010, in Vivian, South Dakota in the United States; it measured in diameter and in circumference, weighing in at . This broke the previous record for diameter set by a hailstone diameter and circumference which fell in Aurora, Nebraska in the United States on 22 June 2003, as well as the record for weight, set by a hailstone of that fell in Coffeyville, Kansas in 1970.

Various hazards, ranging from hail to lightning can affect outside technology facilities, such as antennas, satellite dishes, and towers. As a result, companies with outside facilities have begun installing such facilities underground, to reduce the risk of damage from storms.

Substantial snowfall can disrupt public infrastructure and services, slowing human activity even in regions that are accustomed to such weather. Air and ground transport may be greatly inhibited or shut down entirely. Populations living in snow-prone areas have developed various ways to travel across the snow, such as skis, snowshoes, and sleds pulled by horses, dogs, or other animals and later, snowmobiles. Basic utilities such as electricity, telephone lines, and gas supply can also fail. In addition, snow can make roads much harder to travel and vehicles attempting to use them can easily become stuck.

The combined effects can lead to a &quot;snow day&quot; on which gatherings such as school, work, or church are officially canceled. In areas that normally have very little or no snow, a snow day may occur when there is only light accumulation or even the threat of snowfall, since those areas are unprepared to handle any amount of snow. In some areas, such as some states in the United States, schools are given a yearly quota of snow days (or &quot;calamity days&quot;). Once the quota is exceeded, the snow days must be made up. In other states, all snow days must be made up. For example, schools may extend the remaining school days later into the afternoon, shorten spring break, or delay the start of summer vacation.

Accumulated snow is removed to make travel easier and safer, and to decrease the long-term effect of a heavy snowfall. This process uses shovels and snowplows, and is often assisted by sprinkling salt or other chloride-based chemicals, which reduce the melting temperature of snow. In some areas with abundant snowfall, such as Yamagata Prefecture, Japan, people harvest snow and store it surrounded by insulation in ice houses. This allows the snow to be used through the summer for refrigeration and air conditioning, which requires far less electricity than traditional cooling methods.

=== Agriculture ===
Hail can cause serious damage, notably to automobiles, aircraft, skylights, glass-roofed structures, livestock, and most commonly, farmers&#x27; crops. Wheat, corn, soybeans, and tobacco are the most sensitive crops to hail damage. Hail is one of Canada&#x27;s most expensive hazards. Snowfall can be beneficial to agriculture by serving as a thermal insulator, conserving the heat of the Earth and protecting crops from subfreezing weather. Some agricultural areas depend on an accumulation of snow during winter that will melt gradually in spring, providing water for crop growth. If it melts into water and refreezes upon sensitive crops, such as oranges, the resulting ice will protect the fruit from exposure to lower temperatures. Although tropical cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property, they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they affect and bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions. Hurricanes in the eastern north Pacific often supply moisture to the Southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. Japan receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons. Hurricane Camille averted drought conditions and ended water deficits along much of its path, though it also killed 259 people and caused $9.14 billion (2005 USD) in damage.

=== Aviation ===
Hail is one of the most significant thunderstorm hazards to aircraft. When hail stones exceed in diameter, planes can be seriously damaged within seconds. The hailstones accumulating on the ground can also be hazardous to landing aircraft. Strong wind outflow from thunderstorms causes rapid changes in the three-dimensional wind velocity just above ground level. Initially, this outflow causes a headwind that increases airspeed, which normally causes a pilot to reduce engine power if they are unaware of the wind shear. As the aircraft passes into the region of the downdraft, the localized headwind diminishes, reducing the aircraft&#x27;s airspeed and increasing its sink rate. Then, when the aircraft passes through the other side of the downdraft, the headwind becomes a tailwind, reducing lift generated by the wings, and leaving the aircraft in a low-power, low-speed descent. This can lead to an accident if the aircraft is too low to effect a recovery before ground contact. As the result of the accidents in the 1970s and 1980s, in 1988 the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have on-board wind shear detection systems by 1993. Between 1964 and 1985, wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the U.S. that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries. Since 1995, the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years, due to the mandated on-board detection as well as the addition of Doppler weather radar units on the ground.

=== Recreation ===
Many winter sports, such as skiing, snowboarding, snowmobiling, and snowshoeing depend upon snow. Where snow is scarce but the temperature is low enough, snow cannons may be used to produce an adequate amount for such sports. Children and adults can play on a sled or ride in a sleigh. Although a person&#x27;s footsteps remain a visible within a snow-covered landscape, snow cover is considered a general danger to hiking since the snow obscures landmarks and makes the landscape itself appear uniform.

== Notable storms in art and culture ==
=== In mythology and literature ===
According to the Bible, a giant storm sent by God flooded the Earth. Noah and his family and the animals entered the Ark, and &quot;the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened, and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.&quot; The flood covered even the highest mountains to a depth of more than twenty feet, and all creatures died; only Noah and those with him on the Ark were left alive. In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is recorded to have calmed a storm on the Sea of Galilee.

The Gilgamesh flood myth is a deluge story in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;.

In Greek mythology Aeolus, keeper of storm-winds, squalls and tempests.

The &quot;Sea Venture&quot; was wrecked near Bermuda in 1609, which led to the colonization of Bermuda and provided the inspiration for Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot;(1611). Specifically, Sir Thomas Gates, future governor of Virginia, was on his way to England from Jamestown, Virginia. On Saint James Day, while he was between Cuba and the Bahamas, a hurricane raged for nearly two days. Though one of the small vessels in the fleet sank to the bottom of the Florida Straits, seven of the remaining vessels reached Virginia within several days after the storm. The flagship of the fleet, known as &quot;Sea Adventure&quot;, disappeared and was presumed lost. A small bit of fortune befell the ship and her crew when they made landfall on Bermuda. The vessel was damaged on a surrounding coral reef, but all aboard survived for nearly a year on the island. The British colonists claimed the island and quickly settled Bermuda. In May 1610, they set forth for Jamestown, this time arriving at their destination.

The children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, written by L. Frank Baum and illustrated by W. W. Denslow, chronicles the adventures of a young girl named Dorothy Gale in the Land of Oz, after being swept away from her Kansas farm home by a tornado. The story was originally published by the George M. Hill Company in Chicago on 17 May 1900, and has since been reprinted numerous times, most often under the name &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, and adapted for use in other media. Thanks in part to the 1939 MGM movie, it is one of the best-known stories in American popular culture and has been widely translated. Its initial success, and the success of the popular 1902 Broadway musical which Baum adapted from his original story, led to Baum&#x27;s writing thirteen more Oz books.

Hollywood director King Vidor (8 February 1894 – 1 November 1982) survived the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 as a boy. Based on that experience, he published a fictionalized account of that cyclone, titled &quot;Southern Storm&quot;, for the May 1935 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. Erik Larson excerpts a passage from that article in his 2005 book, &quot;Isaac&#x27;s Storm&quot;:
:&quot;I remember now that it seemed as if we were in a bowl looking up toward the level of the sea. As we stood there in the sandy street, my mother and I, I wanted to take my mother&#x27;s hand and hurry her away. I felt as if the sea was going to break over the edge of the bowl and come puring down upon us.&quot;

Numerous other accounts of the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 have been made in print and in film. Larson cites many of them in &quot;Isaac&#x27;s Storm&quot;, which centrally features that storm, as well as chronicles the creation of the Weather Bureau (which came to known as the National Weather Service) and that agency&#x27;s fateful rivalry with the weather service in Cuba, and a number of other major storms, such as those which ravaged Indianola, Texas in 1875 and 1886.

The Great Storm of 1987 is key in an important scene near the end of &quot;Possession: A Romance&quot;, the bestselling and Booker Prize-winning novel by A. S. Byatt. The Great Storm of 1987 occurred on the night of 15–16 October 1987, when an unusually strong weather system caused winds to hit much of southern England and northern France. It was the worst storm to hit England since the Great Storm of 1703 (284 years earlier) and was responsible for the deaths of at least 22 people in England and France combined (18 in England, at least four in France).

Hurricane Katrina (2005) has been featured in a number of works of fiction.

=== In fine art ===
The Romantic seascape painters J. M. W. Turner and Ivan Aivazovsky created some of the most lasting impressions of the sublime and stormy seas that are firmly imprinted on the popular mind. Turner&#x27;s representations of powerful natural forces reinvented the traditional seascape during the first half of the nineteenth century.

Upon his travels to Holland, he took note of the familiar large rolling waves of the English seashore transforming into the sharper, choppy waves of a Dutch storm. A characteristic example of Turner&#x27;s dramatic seascape is &quot;The Slave Ship&quot; of 1840. Aivazovsky left several thousand turbulent canvases in which he increasingly eliminated human figures and historical background to focus on such essential elements as light, sea, and sky. His grandiose &quot;Ninth Wave&quot; (1850) is an ode to human daring in the face of the elements.

=== In motion pictures ===
The 1926 silent film &quot;The Johnstown Flood&quot; features the Great Flood of 1889 in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The flood, caused by the catastrophic failure of the South Fork Dam after days of extremely heavy rainfall, prompted the first major disaster relief effort by the American Red Cross, directed by Clara Barton. The Johnstown Flood was depicted in numerous other media (both fictional and in non-fiction), as well.

Warner Bros.&#x27; 2000 dramatic disaster film &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;, directed by Wolfgang Petersen, is an adaptation of Sebastian Junger&#x27;s 1997 non-fiction book of the same title. The book and film feature the crew of the &quot;Andrea Gail&quot;, which got caught in the Perfect Storm of 1991. The 1991 Perfect Storm, also known as the Halloween Nor&#x27;easter of 1991, was a nor&#x27;easter that absorbed Hurricane Grace and ultimately evolved into a small hurricane late in its life cycle.

=== In music ===
Storms have also been portrayed in many works of music. Examples of storm music include Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;Four Seasons&quot; violin concerto RV 315 (&quot;Summer&quot;) (third movement: Presto), Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Pastoral Symphony&quot; (the fourth movement), a scene in Act II of Rossini&#x27;s opera &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, the third act of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s Rigoletto, and the fifth (Cloudburst) movement of Ferde Grofé&#x27;s Grand Canyon Suite.

<text>Panama is a town in Le Flore County, Oklahoma, United States. It is part of the Fort Smith, Arkansas-Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,413 at the 2010 census.

==History==
A post office was established at Panama, Indian Territory on January 14, 1898. At the time of its founding, Panama was located in Skullyville County, part of the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

This town began as a coal mining community named Red Town because all of the miners&#x27; shacks were painted red. The origin of the town name of &quot;Panama&quot; is uncertain. Some historians claim that the name was inspired by the building of the Panama Canal. But since the town was already called Panama by 1898, the inspiration would have to have been based on the unsuccessful French effort at building the canal which started 1881 and ended in 1889, and not the successful American effort which did not start until 1904 and was not completed until 1914. In 1896 the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad (trackage acquired by the Kansas City Southern Railway in 1900) built a north–south line through the region. The Midland Valley Railroad built an east–west line through the region in 1903–1904. The town of Panama moved to the crossing of the two railroads. The Panama post office first opened January 14, 1898, but the order was rescinded for some unknown reason on February 23, 1898. The post office reopened February 21, 1899.

Panama was still supported by coal mining in 1930. The Ozark Coal and Mining Company had established itself there in 1898, however the coal mines began to close in the 1930s. A creosote plant, established in 1937, provided some jobs for the former miners. The Panama Coal Company, which had engaged in strip mining, went bankrupt in 1977.
