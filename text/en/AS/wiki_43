<text>Durant () is a city in Bryan County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 18,589 in the 2020 census. It serves as the capital of the Choctaw Nation, and is the largest settlement on the reservation, ranking ahead of McAlester and Poteau. Durant is the principal city of the Durant Micropolitan Statistical Area, which had a population of 46,067 in 2020. Durant is also part of the Dallas–Fort Worth Combined Statistical Area, anchoring the northern edge.

The city was founded by Dixon Durant, a Choctaw who lived in the area, after the MK&amp;T railroad came through the Indian Territory in the early 1870s. It became the county seat of Bryan County in 1907 after Oklahoma statehood.

Durant is home to Southeastern Oklahoma State University and the headquarters of the Choctaw Nation. The city is officially known as the Magnolia Capital of Oklahoma. The city and its micropolitan are a major part of the Texoma region.

==History==

The Durant area was once claimed by both Spain and France before officially becoming part of the United States after the Louisiana Purchase and Adams–Onís Treaty. During the 1820s and 1830s the area was designated as part of the Choctaw Nation in the southern Indian Territory. During the Indian removals the Choctaws followed the Choctaw Trail of Tears from their ancestral homeland in Mississippi and Alabama into this area. The Choctaw Nation originally extended from the Mexican border in the west (now part of the Texas panhandle) to the Arkansas Territory in the east, from the Red River in the south to the South Canadian River in the north. In 1855, the Choctaw and Chickasaws formally divided their land into two separate nations, with Durant remaining in Choctaw territory on the east. Chickasaw land extended west to the boundary that would divide Indian Territory from Oklahoma Territory after passage of the Oklahoma Organic Act in 1890.

Pierre Durant and his four sons, all of French-Choctaw origin, made the journey up the Trail of Tears on the way to the southeastern part of the Choctaw Nation in 1832. The brothers, grown, with families of their own, established homesteads from the Arkansas line to Durant. One son, Fisher, married to a full-blood Choctaw, found a beautiful location for a home between Durant&#x27;s present Eighth and Ninth avenues. At the time of Durant&#x27;s founding it was located in Blue County, a part of the Pushmataha District of the Choctaw Nation.

Fisher Durant&#x27;s son Dixon Durant is recognized as the founder of Durant and is honored as its namesake. A minister, businessman and civic leader, Dixon Durant is credited with pastorates in local Presbyterian, Congregational and Methodist churches. He established the first store selling general merchandise in 1873, around the time of the 1872 creation of the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad (Katy Railroad) siding at Durant, which was the initial impetus for establishing the community.

The Missouri-Kansas and Texas Railway (also known as the MKT or &quot;Katy&quot;) had already laid a line through the area that would become Durant by November 1882. A wheelless boxcar was parked on the siding there and named &quot;Durant Station&quot;. Dixon Durant erected the first building, adjacent to the boxcar, where he opened a general store in 1873. The first post office, also named as Durant Station, Indian Territory, opened February 20, 1879, but closed on July 11, 1881. A.E. Fulsom was postmaster. The U.S. Postal Service re-established the post office at the site as Durant on March 8, 1882, dropping the word &quot;station&quot; from the name. Beginning in 1882, the area was simply called Durant.

W.H. Hilton was elected the first mayor of Durant.

A memorable event in Durant&#x27;s rail history occurred on April 5, 1905. A special southbound Katy train stopped in the city with President Theodore Roosevelt aboard.

In 1895, a fire destroyed the original business district, which had spread along the Katy tracks.

Calvin Institute was opened in 1894, representing the first institute of higher education in the immediate area, which was an outgrowth of Presbyterian mission work among the Choctaw Indian nation. Its success led it being reopened as a larger school, Durant Presbyterian College in 1901, later renamed as Oklahoma Presbyterian College. After statehood became effective on November 16, 1907, the state legislature created the Southeastern State Normal School at Durant, which opened March 6, 1909. This school was renamed Southeastern State Teachers College in 1921, and renamed again in 1974 as the present Southeastern Oklahoma State University.

Further growth of the town was inhibited by its proximity to the larger town of Caddo (also on the Katy line) and the fact that Dixon Durant did not want to sell more of the land he had inherited to non-Indians. In the 1902-1903 timeframe, the St. Louis, San Francisco and New Orleans Railroad, an affiliate of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway (also known as &quot;SL&amp;SF&quot; or &quot;Frisco&quot;) had intended to build an east–west line through Caddo, where it would intersect the Katy. A rapid land price increase near Caddo instead caused the Frisco to bypass it in favor of Durant.

In 1904, Durant was named in a grand jury instruction as a sundown town where a notice had been posted warning African Americans not to stay after dark.

The Oklahoma Constitutional Convention selected Durant as the county seat for Bryan County, Oklahoma, which would supersede Blue County at statehood. In 1908, a special election ratified this choice over three other candidates for the honor: Bokchito, Blue, and Sterrett (later renamed Calera).

Bryan County was created from Choctaw lands in 1907, the same time as statehood, and was named after William Jennings Bryan. Bryan was nominated three times for President of the United States and at the age of 36 lost to William McKinley. He lost to McKinley again in 1900, and to William H. Taft in 1908. Woodrow Wilson appointed the county&#x27;s namesake as United States Secretary of State in 1913.

Eleven people were killed in Durant by a tornado in April 1919.

The town&#x27;s population grew from 2,969 in 1900 to 5,330 in 1910, 12,823 in 1990, and to 13,549 in 2000.

The Durant Downtown Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Lynching of John Lee ==

John Lee was an African American man who was lynched on August 12, 1911, in Durant, Oklahoma. He was subjected to a brutal act of mob violence, denial of judicial due process, and the desecration of his body posthumously. The event is a reflection of the racial tensions and injustices prevalent in the United States during the early 20th century.

The book &quot;Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America&quot; by Twin Palms Publishers includes a photo from Durant on August 13, 1911, of a group of townspeople burning the body of an African American man named John Lee.

The author of &quot;Without Sanctuary&quot; summarizes that, &quot;According to the August 14 issue of the Durant Daily Democrat, Lee died at 11:15 p.m. at the hands of a posse of 500. An additional 1,500 citizens were estimated to have been involved in the manhunt. Reports indicate that Lee exchanged gunfire with his would-be captors until his ammunition was spent. The posse &quot;calmly emptied their guns into his body&quot;. Lee was accused of a range of crimes, the most serious of which was the critical wounding of a white woman, Mrs. Fanny Campbell. She identified the corpse as that of her assailant. Mrs. Campbell expired later the same day. The mob took John Lee&#x27;s body to a vacant lot near the railroad tracks, where they built a pyre of gathered lumber and set the remains on fire. It burned from nine in the morning until late in the afternoon. All that remained were ashes and a &quot;few charred parcels&quot;. Whites rioted throughout the town of Durant. The city&#x27;s remaining blacks were warned &quot;not to let the sun go down on them here&quot;. All left by sunset. Rumors spread that blacks were organizing to return and avenge Lee&#x27;s death. Durant&#x27;s white citizens armed for the coming &quot;race war&quot;. In several days, without additional violence, tensions calmed.

The support for the school came from the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, the federal government, and several denominational missionary boards. Because of financial difficulties, the school was closed as a learning institution in the late 1960s. Chief Clark David Gardner established the Choctaw Nation administrative offices at the old Oklahoma Presbyterian College Building in 1975.

Despite it all, Durant was featured in several blogs published by the production.

== Other distinctions ==
Durant has had the honor to be recognized on a national scale on various occasions, regarding famous visitations or other attention. An example of this is as follows:

* On April 5, 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt arrived in Durant on a train, and gave a speech, using the rear of the train as his platform. He later revisited the community in 1910, staying in the downtown Bryan Hotel, while on a hunting trip in the area.
* First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt visited the community, speaking on March 20, 1937, for Senior Day at Southeastern Teachers College, as it was known at the time. She spoke at the invitation of the president of the college, Kate Galt Zaneis. Mrs. Roosevelt noted in her diary, &quot;I spoke to a packed auditorium of young people, who proved to be a remarkably good audience.&quot; As Mrs. Roosevelt stepped up to speak, the orchestra played &quot;Let Me Call You Sweetheart.&quot; Mrs. Zaneis said the song was chosen because Mrs. Roosevelt was loved so much. Mrs. Roosevelt received around 2300 people that afternoon. She notes &quot;I rarely do this, but it is also rare for a woman to be a president of a college where there are both men and women students.&quot; She also wrote that upon boarding the train to leave town, some of the students waiting at the depot assisted her in loading fifty-four boxes of flowers as gifts to her onto the train.
* In 1953, actor José Ferrer and actress/singer Rosemary Clooney were married in Durant while Jose was performing in the musical &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; in Dallas.
*According to papers from the FBI released during the drop of Kennedy documents released in 2017, Jack Ruby went to Durant to look at purchasing a motel just north of town in 1960. He was accompanied by Roy Kimes and Joe Russell Wyatt to area, dropping off Wyatt in Colbert and subsequently picking him up on the way back to Farmersville.
*On June 2, 1965, less than two years after her former husband was believed to have shot President John F Kennedy (and was subsequently shot himself), Marina Oswald and fiancé Kenneth Porter, came to Durant to get married due to the blood testing laws of the time. They arrived early in the day to take the blood tests, but were told to return at 2pm for the results. They ate lunch and drove out to Lake Texoma to pass time before 2 pm. By the time 2pm came around, the media had caught up to them and they fled to Sherman, Texas to avoid the attention. They were eventually married that evening in Fate, Texas.
* On July 15, 2015, President Barack Obama visited the city to address the nation from Durant High School on his &quot;Promised Zone&quot; initiative. In 2014, the President designated five areas in the United States as Promised Zones, including the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. The other areas designated were Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Antonio, and Southeastern Kentucky. The initiative was &quot;designed to create jobs and increase economic security by partnering local communities with business.&quot; While speaking, he also introduced his ConnectHome initiative, which is designed to open up greater access to the internet for low income households.
* In August 2016, Durant found itself at the unlikely center of controversy after an online petition was created by a citizen of Edmond, Oklahoma, Ryan Nazari, suggesting that Durant should be forced to change its name to Westbrook in honor of Russell Westbrook, after Kevin Durant&#x27;s unpopular departure from the Oklahoma City Thunder. &quot;Ladies and gentleman, the great state of Oklahoma has been betrayed...It is because of this heinous action that I believe the State of Oklahoma has a responsibility to change the name of the City of Durant to Westbrook, the man who is loyal, whom we believe in, and who will lead our team to glory. Yes, it is understood that the city Durant was not named after the evil Kevin Durant, but it is just another hideous reminder of what happened,&quot; Nazari&#x27;s petition read. Neither the creator of the petition, nor Kevin Durant had ever visited the community. The news surrounding the petition led to an article by ESPN and later by The New York Times.
* In December 2016, Durant gained national attention again. &quot;People&quot; published a light-hearted article regarding the Durant Fire Department&#x27;s annual Christmas Card. The department had experienced the birth of six babies during the year and decided to feature them in their annual Christmas card. &quot;If you ask many of the fire fighters in Durant, OK what defines them; they will say brotherhood and family. That is why when this small paid department of 33 looked back on the year and saw that 6 of their brothers had newborn babies, it was time to show the public what was at the core of their department.&quot;

==History==

The incorporated town of Kemp, Oklahoma is located in the southern part of Bryan County, Oklahoma and was originally settled in the 1880s with the name of Warner Springs. The town was renamed Kemp, Indian Territory, in 1890 after prominent Chickasaw Legislator Jackson Kemp. The town is also in the southeast corner of Panola County of the Chickasaw Nation. It became part of Bryan County with the Statehood of Oklahoma in 1907.

The post office for the town of Kemp was established October 20, 1890. The town was surveyed and staked out August 8, 1901, and town lots were sold October 20, 1905. 
Board sidewalks lined Main Street of Kemp in the early years. The First Bank of Kemp, several grocery stores, a pharmacy, barber shops, livery stables, a hardware store, a blacksmith shop, a butcher shop, cafes, and even a hotel made the business district of the town. However, when the Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad (later the Kansas, Oklahoma and Gulf) located three miles west of the town in 1912, many of the businesses including the bank located there in Kemp City, later renamed Hendrix, and the town of Kemp began its decline. The last store in the town closed in 1980.

Many girls of Chickasaw Indian descent from the area attended Bloomfield Academy, an Indian girls’ school located three miles northwest of Kemp operated by the Chickasaw Nation from 1852 until 1911. During the early years of Kemp, the other children would attend school in the one-room log school house called Warner Springs School, located just south of town. A larger frame school building was built around 1907. A brick building was later built that burned around 1940 and was replaced by a rock school building. The first Kemp High School graduating class was in 1932 and the last class to graduate was in 1968, when the school lost its accreditation during the mass consolidation efforts of the state in the late 1960s. The mascot for the school was the Kemp Tigers. Most students in the area now attend school at Achille, Oklahoma. The rock school building is owned by the town and serves the area as the Kemp Community Center.
There are two active churches in the town: the Kemp Baptist Church and the Kemp Church of Christ.
Most working adults are employed in either Durant, Oklahoma or in Sherman-Denison, Texas. Most adults seeking higher education attend Southeastern Oklahoma State University in Durant, or Grayson County College, in Denison, Texas.

<text>Anadarko is a city in and the county seat of Caddo County, Oklahoma, United States. The city is 50 miles (80.5 km) southwest of Oklahoma City. The population was 5,745 at the 2020 census. 

==History==
Anadarko got its name when its post office was established in 1873. The designation came from the Nadaco Native Americans, a branch of the Caddo Nation, and the &quot;A&quot; was added due to a clerical error.

In 1871, the Wichita Agency was reestablished on the north bank of the Washita River after being destroyed in the American Civil War. The Wichita Agency administered the affairs of the Wichita, Caddo and other tribes. In 1878, the Kiowa-Comanche Agency at Fort Sill was consolidated with the Wichita Agency.

In 1901, the federal government confiscated the lands of the Kiowa, Comanche and Arapaho Reservations, and opened the surplus land to white settlement. On August 6, 1901, an auction was held for homesteads and town lots. Around 5,000 people were living in &quot;Rag Town&quot; on the east edge of Anadarko awaiting the auction. Although 20,000 people were present for auction day, Anadarko&#x27;s population dwindled to 2,190 in 1907.

Agriculture has been the principal driver of the local economy, since the Washita Valley has been good for crops and livestock. The second pillar of the local economy has been Native American affairs.

==Culture==
===Native American significance===
Anadarko, the self-titled &quot;Indian Capital of the Nation.&quot; It is the capital of the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes, the Delaware Nation and the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma. The city houses the National Hall of Fame for Famous American Indians.

Anadarko is named after the Nadaco, a Caddo band now affiliated with the Caddo Nation. In the Caddo language, &quot;Nadá-kuh&quot; means &quot;bumblebee place&quot;. The Caddo are a federally recognized Native American tribe for which Caddo County is named. Caddo County is part of the former reservation of the Caddo, Wichita, and Delaware Nation, prior to allotment in the post-Dawes Allotment Era.

Culturally, Anadarko is rare among Oklahoma cities as Native Americans form a near-majority. Locals are often familiar with a few basic Indian words, such as &quot;haw-nay&quot;, Kiowa for &quot;no.&quot; Wichita and Apache words are sometimes employed in casual conversation as well, such as &quot;hangy&quot;, &quot;ah-ho&quot;, &quot;ebote&quot;, and &quot;bocote&quot;. Native American motifs are commonly used for design, art, and other aspects of daily life.

Anadarko has a Bureau of Indian Affairs office. The town is situated between the Wichita, Caddo, and Delaware reservations to the north, and the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache reservations to the south. These reservations were dismantled by the allotment of tribal lands to individual members, and the opening of the &quot;excess&quot; lands to settlement, in a series of land openings. The area surrounded by Anadarko was opened to settlement by a 1901 land lottery affecting the Kiowa, Comanche, Wichita and Caddo lands.

The Anadarko area is home to Riverside Indian School, a Bureau of Indian Education boarding and day school for Native American students.

==Education==
Anadarko Public Schools consists of three elementary schools, Sunset Elementary, East Elementary, and Mission Elementary; a middle school; and a high school. There are approximately 1,950 students.

Riverside Indian School is near Anadarko.

<text>Apache is a town in Caddo County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,444 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Before opening the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache Reservation on August 1, 1901, for unrestricted settlement by non-Indians, Land Lottery Director William A. Richards had recommended setting aside the land now occupied by Apache as a townsite. He had expected the community would be named &quot;Richards&quot; in his honor. Instead, officials of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway (Rock Island) named the community Apache. A land run for lots in Apache was held on August 6, 1901, which was the last land run in Oklahoma. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture,&quot; five lumberyards and six saloons opened for business within hours after the run. A tent served as a market for groceries.

An election of the town&#x27;s first city officials was held in an outdoor meeting on the evening of August 6, 1901. E. E. Blake was elected as mayor and F. E. Richey as city clerk. Appointed officials included I. F. Crow, city attorney, and Sam Wass, city marshal. Apache was incorporated on July 22, 1902.

<text>Carnegie is a town in Caddo County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,430 as of the 2020 United States census.

== History and culture==
Carnegie was named after the famous Scottish American industrialist and philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie. The initial name of the town was Latham. The town was originally platted as North and South Latham, with North Latham being north of the Washita River, and South Latham being south of it. North Latham was intended to be the commercial hub, with the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway expected to go along the north side of the river. However, the tracks ended up running along the south bank of the Washita, so South Latham became the commercial hub and North Latham withered and/or was never developed.

Leaders of the town decided shortly after incorporation in 1903 to rename the town Carnegie in the hopes the industrialist would build a library there. Although the town acquired a library, Andrew Carnegie did not provide it. Of note, there is unofficially a &quot;Carnegie Hall&quot;, known more properly as the Carnegie Memorial Auditorium, where community events are held. While currently on hiatus, for several years there was an annual &quot;Stars of Carnegie Hall&quot; talent show showcasing individuals across the region and state in a local talent show, in which both local and regional talents were represented.

Carnegie High School has won three state titles in boys basketball (1988, 1992, 1996), as well as three titles in girls cross country (2002, 2003, 2004). Carnegie High also has three won state titles in boys cross country (1999, 2000, 2020).
The Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma headquarters are located in Carnegie.

==History==
On August 25, 1901, Louise (probably called Cyril) Lookingglass, the infant daughter of Bayard (Monapahrah) and Laura (Tit-tah-ter-way) Lookingglass, was allotted of land that would become the Cyril townsite. Louise Lookingglass died in 1903. Bayard Lookingglass sold one-half of the allotment to Mr. and Mrs. Pierson on July 26, 1907. The Piersons sold the land to the Cyril Townsite and Development Company on September 10, 1907.

Although there is some dispute, the Cyril Station appears to have been named circa 1902 after Bayard and Laura Lookingglasses&#x27; daughter when they granted the railroad permission to build a section house next to the railroad stop. Some believed that the town of Cyril was named after the Cyril Station of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad. However a diligent search of all sources including Frisco Railroad, found no supporting evidence.

The townsite was surveyed, plotted out and dedicated in September 1907. Construction began in early 1908 and by April there were 200 inhabitants, 3 hardware stores, 3 grocery stores, a general tin and pump house, restaurant, rooming house, pool hall, two barber shops, blacksmith shop, lumberyard, feed yard and feed mill.

The town was the site of an oil refinery from the early 1920s until it was closed in 1984. During that time, the refinery was operated by Anderson-Prichard Refining, APCO, and later Oklahoma Refining. It was the major economic driver for the town, employing 160 people at the time of closure. An unsuccessful attempt was made in the early 1990s to restart part of the refinery. As of 2010, the refinery had been demolished and the site was a Superfund environmental cleanup site.

<text>Eakly is a town in Caddo County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 338 at the 2010 census.

==History==
A post office was established in the community of Eakly in March 1902, while this area was still part of Oklahoma Territory. Apparently, a plat was not filed for the town until the 1920s, which meant that town lots could not be sold during the first two decades of Eakly&#x27;s formal existence. Two organizations were exempted from this limit: the Methodist church bought a building site in 1914, and the Bank of Eakly bought a site in 1920. All others who wished to build in the town had to lease the land.

Eakly&#x27;s first census was in 1940, showing 231 residents. The population dropped somewhat during World War II, and registered 191 in 1950, probably because people moved to military service and war production work in larger towns and cities. There was an upswing in 1960 and 1970, which peaked at 452 by 1980. The count dropped to 277 in 1990, and has never again approached the 1980 high.

The lack of a registered town plat and the lack of a railroad did not prevent Eakly from prospering as an agricultural center. Cotton farming was the main activity in early decades. After World War II, irrigation began to spread into this part of Oklahoma, enabling more diverse crops. Peanut farming became the leading agricultural activity in the 1960s. The community incorporated as a town in 1957. A house manufacturing plant was built in 1970, but soon went out of business.

In 1999, the Eakly school system decided to end its 78-year existence and merge into the system at Hydro, approximately north. The closing was attributed to a 1990 state educational reform law that promised financial incentives to small school districts that agreed to consolidate. The surviving district in this case will be known as the Hydro-Eakly District

<text>Fort Cobb is a town in Caddo County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 518 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Fort Cobb was established as a U.S. Army frontier post in Indian Territory on October 1, 1859, east of the present location of the town. The fort was named after Secretary of the Treasury Howell Cobb, a friend of the founding officer, Major William Emory. The post was later occupied by both Southern and Northern forces during the Civil War, the Union taking control of the fort as part of the 1862 Tonkawa massacre.

Later, Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer&#x27;s command was encamped at Fort Cobb from December 18, 1868, to January 6, 1869. Shortly after that, on March 12, 1869, the fort was abandoned in favor of a location to the south near the Wichita Mountains, and renamed Fort Sill.

The town of Fort Cobb was founded in 1899, and simply named Cobb, which was renamed Fort Cobb in 1902 to honor the defunct military post. At statehood in 1907, the town had 467 residents.

<text>El Reno is a city in and the county seat of Canadian County, Oklahoma, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 16,989, marking a change of 1.55% from 16,729, recorded in the 2010 census. The city was begun shortly after the 1889 land rush and named for the nearby Fort Reno. It is located in Central Oklahoma, about west of downtown Oklahoma City.

==History==

The land of Canadian County belonged to the historic Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes at the time of European encounter. In 1874, the United States established a fort to supervise the area and General Philip Sheridan took command. He named it Fort Reno in honor of his friend, Gen. Jesse L. Reno, who was killed in the American Civil War.

After the 1889 landrun, there were three entities the local postmaster had to keep separate - Fort Reno, Reno City, and the community township or Village of (El) Reno. The Village of El Reno originated shortly after the 1889 land run, with the post office coming into being in June of that year.

Although &quot;el reno&quot; means &quot;the reindeer&quot; in Spanish, the town was actually named, in part, after nearby Fort Reno. Reindeer are not native to Oklahoma.

The town&#x27;s name was taken from the nearby military post of Fort Reno, with the &quot;el&quot; (meaning &quot;the&quot; in Spanish) later added by the local postmaster to help differentiate the community from the also newly established Reno City.

Reno City was located on the north-side of the Canadian River five miles northeast of community of El Reno. The community of El Reno was located on the south-side of the Canadian river.

The original village townsite was platted by the Oklahoma Homestead and Town Company on 120 acres of the homestead of John Foreman. In 1890, Foreman&#x27;s 120 acres along with 80 acres of Thomas Jensen&#x27;s, were incorporated into the Village of El Reno.

After the railroad company announced their rail lines were going to run on the south side of the Canadian river, Reno City relocated to the township of El Reno. The original Reno City site north of the river was abandoned. What remained and continues to this day is Fort Reno and the city of El Reno.

El Reno is located on the 98th meridian west, about 25 miles west of Oklahoma City. The eastern side of the meridian was opened to non-Indian settlement in the Land Rush of 1889. The western side was opened in 1892, when the federal government also made some Cheyenne and Arapaho lands available for settlement by non-Native Americans. The town was subsequently selected as the land district office for the 1901 land lottery drawings.

In 1932, the United States Southwestern Reformatory was constructed about west of El Reno. The federal reformatory housed male adult federal prisoners and was later restricted to house young adult male prisoners, aged 18 to 26. In the mid-1970s it was renamed by the United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, as the Federal Correctional Institution, El Reno (FCI El Reno). Prisoner age limits were lifted and men of all ages have been incarcerated here ever since. As medium-security prison, it has become the fifth-largest federal prison in the U.S. The prison is still one of the largest employers in El Reno. In 2015 President Barack Obama visited the prison, the first time a sitting president has visited any federal prison.

During World War II, Fort Reno, about northwest of El Reno, was the site of a prisoner of war camp for Germans and Italians. The POW cemetery has been preserved and has stones bearing the names of German and Italian prisoners who died there.

Following World War II, the US Army determined it did not need the fort. In 1948 the fort was transferred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, for use as a research laboratory. The laboratory studies environmentally sustainable forage and livestock production, contributing to preservation of the Great Plains of North America.

At one time, railroads contributed strongly to the city economy. A terminal and repair facility for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (CRI&amp;P or &quot;Rock Island&quot;), which employed a large number of people, was based here. Some 750 of the company&#x27;s 970 employees in the state worked in El Reno. Due to changes taking place throughout the railroad industry, the CRI&amp;P went bankrupt in 1979. It abandoned the depot and railyards in 1980. The railyards are still vacant.

== Culture ==
A legend says the fried onion burger was invented at the Hamburger Inn in El Reno in the 1920s so the owner could save money by using less meat in his five-cent burgers.

Since 1988 El Reno holds an annual Fried Onion Burger Day Festival in downtown the first Saturday in May. 
In 2001, El Reno was the first city in Oklahoma to re-establish streetcar service in the downtown area: the Heritage Express Trolley. Such service had not been available since 1947, and it was the only operating trolley line in the state that year. Another line has since been started in Oklahoma City. The Heritage Express was installed with aid of a federal transportation grant and as part of a complex project also to improve the downtown&#x27;s streets and drainage system.

The former train depot and some other buildings were acquired by the Canadian County Historical Society for adaptive use as part of a museum complex. The 1954 film noir &quot;Human Desire&quot; includes locomotive and yard scenes filmed in the El Reno rail yards.

El Reno is a Main Street America community. The Oklahoma Main Street Program is part of a national network affiliated with the National Trust for Historic Preservation. El Reno started its Main Street program in 1988; it was one of four cities in 2006 selected nationally to win the annual Great American Main Street Award. El Reno&#x27;s program focusses on the Rock District of downtown.

Buildings in the town that are on the National Register of Historic Places include the Carnegie Library, El Reno High School, and the Mennoville Mennonite Church.

==Geography==

El Reno is located at the interchange of I-40 and U.S. Route 81. At one time, it sat on the boundary between Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory, and sits approximately west of the old Chisholm Trail. Jesse Chisholm is buried nearby.

It damaged billboards before striking a motel and a mobile home park at U.S. Highway 81, both of which suffered significant damage. One part of the motel had most of its second-floor walls destroyed, and several mobile homes were destroyed, killing two people and injuring many others. East of Highway 81, the tornado damaged an automobile service building and a house on Route 66. The tornado caused tree damage before dissipating on Alfadale Road north of Route 66.

<text>Yukon is a city in eastern Canadian County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 23,630 at the 2020 census. Founded in the 1890s, the town was named in reference to a gold rush in Yukon Territory, Canada, at the time. Historically, Yukon served as an urban center for area farmers and the site of a milling operation. Currently, it is primarily a residential community for people who work in the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area.

==History==
Yukon was founded by A.N. Spencer in 1891 and was named for the Yukon River which flows from British Columbia, across the Yukon, and into Alaska.

Spencer, a cattleman from Texas turned railroad builder, was working on a line from El Reno to Arkansas when he decided to build the town. Spencer filed the plat on the townsite on February 14, 1891. He had agreed to do so and lay the train tracks through the town in exchange for half of the lots, which were owned by Minnie Taylor and Luther S. Morrison. Taylor and Morrison had acquired the land in the 1889 land run. Spencer also bought two quarter sections south of Main Street from Joseph Carson and his sister, Josephine. Spencer and his brother, Lewis, named the town after the Yukon Territory of Canada, where a gold rush was booming at the time.

The first houses and businesses were located on the north side of Spencer Avenue (now Main Street) and present Fourth and Fifth streets. The &quot;Canadian County Courier&quot; reported on April 1, 1891, that the city had 25 homes, one bank, two real estate offices, two restaurants, a lumber yard, a hardware store, a grocery, a livery stable, two saloons, a blacksmith shop, a printing office, a barber shop, and a second barber shop &quot;about completed.&quot;

The Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway Company laid its track, causing the abandonment of Frisco, which had a population of 1,000 at the time. Beginning in about 1898, Yukon began to attract immigrants from Bohemia. Following World War I and the dissolution of Bohemia into Czechoslovakia and Moravia, the immigrants became known as &quot;Czechs.&quot; Yukon is known as the &quot;Czech Capital of Oklahoma&quot;.

The town voted to incorporate in 1901 and voted to add water works, sewer, and electricity from the mill in 1910. Businesses remained clustered on Main Street between Fourth and Fifth, until the 1920s, when they began to locate in other parts of the town. The interurban was built from Oklahoma City to El Reno in 1911. It closed in 1940. Paved roads didn&#x27;t arrive until the construction of State Highway 66 in 1926.

Yukon thrived as the urban center for area farmers and had an organized library by 1905 and a dedicated library building in 1927. A small milling operation, the Yukon Mill and Grain Company, opened in 1893 and grew to shipping flour and feeds throughout the south and exporting them overseas by 1915. The milling operation was owned by the Kroutil and Dobry families, but the Dobry family built their own mill and parted ways with the Kroutils in the 1930s. The mills were sold to larger corporations; Shawnee Mills purchased the Yukon Mill and Grain Company and Mid-Continent purchased the Dobry Mills. Paying homage to that history, the students of Yukon High School are known as &quot;Millers&quot;, and their mascot is &quot;The Miller Man&quot;.

In 1949, Yukon garnered national media attention because of the plight of Grady the Cow, who was stuck inside a silo for four days.

From a population of 830 in 1907, Yukon grew to 1,990 by 1950. By 1960, the population registered at 3,076. Oklahoma City annexed nearly all of the land around Yukon during the 1960s. This brought a boom in residential construction and commercial development. The town had grown to approximately 22,000 residents in 2005.

<doc id="130081" wikidata="Q639640" url="?curid=130081" title="Ardmore, Oklahoma">
<text>Ardmore is the county seat of Carter County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 24,725 at the time of the 2020 census, a 1.8% increase over the 2010 census figure of 24,283. The Ardmore micropolitan statistical area had an estimated population of 48,491 in 2013. Ardmore is from both Oklahoma City and Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, at the junction of Interstate 35 and U.S. Highway 70, and is generally considered the hub of the 13-county region of South Central Oklahoma, also known by state tourism pamphlets as &quot;Chickasaw Country&quot; and previously &quot;Lake and Trail Country&quot;. It is also a part of the Texoma region. Ardmore is situated about south of the Arbuckle Mountains and is located at the eastern margin of the Healdton Basin, one of the most oil-rich regions of the United States.

Ardmore was named after the affluent Philadelphia suburb and historic PRR Main Line stop of Ardmore, Pennsylvania, which was named after Ardmore in County Waterford, Ireland, by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1873. The name &quot;Ardmore&quot; is Irish for high grounds or hill. 

==History==

Ardmore, Indian Territory, began with a plowed ditch for a Main Street in the summer of 1887 in Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation. It owes much of its existence to the construction of the Santa Fe Railroad through the area during that time. It grew, as most frontier towns grew, over the years into a trading outpost for the region. A large fire in 1895 destroyed much of the fledgling town, which forced residents to rebuild nearly the entire town. In the early 1900s, Ardmore became well known for its abundance of cotton-growing fields and eventually became known as the world&#x27;s largest inland cotton port.

The city found itself positioned next to one of the largest oil fields ever produced in Oklahoma, the Healdton Oil Field. After its discovery in 1913, entrepreneurs and wildcatters flooded the area, and Carter County quickly became the largest oil-producing county in Oklahoma, and has remained so ever since. Ardmore has remained an energy center for the region ever since, with the region&#x27;s natural wealth giving birth to such energy giants as the Noble Energy companies, among others. On September 27, 1915, a railroad car containing casing gas exploded, killing 43 people, injuring many, and destroying much of downtown, including areas rebuilt after the 1895 fire. The disaster, which made national news, gave residents the resolve to establish the city&#x27;s first fire department to ensure that such events would not recur in the future. On April 22, 1966, Ardmore was the site of the worst plane crash in Oklahoma history, which killed 83 people. On May 7, 1995, an F3 tornado struck Ardmore, killing three people and injuring six others.

===Sports===

Ardmore was home to minor league baseball. The Ardmore Cardinals was the primary name of Ardmore teams that played as members of the Texas League (1904), Texas-Oklahoma League (1911–1914), Western Association (1917), Texas-Oklahoma League (1921–1922), Western Association (1923), Oklahoma State League (1924), Western Association (1924–1926), Sooner State League (1947–1957) and Texas League (1961). Ardmore captured league championships in 1923, 1925 and 1957. Ardmore was an affiliate of the Cleveland Indians (1947–1948), St. Louis Cardinals (1953–1957) and Baltimore Orioles (1961).

Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Carl Hubbell played for the Ardmore Bearcats in 1924, his first professional season.

==Transportation==
===Highways===
Interstate 35 passes through the western side of Ardmore, as it traverses the United States from Duluth, Minnesota, to Laredo, Texas.

Ardmore has four exits off I-35:
* Exit 29 (US-70 east)
* Exits 31A-B (State Highway 199 east/U.S. 70 west, respectively)
* Exit 32 (12th St NW)
* Exit 33 (State Highway 142).

Ardmore is also home to the junction of US-70 and US-77, SH-142 and SH-199. Ardmore is connected to Lake Murray via State Highway 77S.

===Airports===
Ardmore has two general aviation airports, Ardmore Downtown Executive Airport and Ardmore Municipal Airport. In the early 1950s, commercial air transportation was provided to the Municipal Airport by Central Airlines. Currently, the nearest scheduled air service is available at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, north and south of Ardmore, respectively. Ardmore is linked by rail with the DFW Airport via the &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot; to Trinity Railway Express connection.

===Rail===
Ardmore has one principal rail line, that being one of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe mainlines running from Fort Worth, Texas to Oklahoma City (also connecting with Kansas City and Chicago), being the route of the current Heartland Flyer passenger rail service. This line was formerly part of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe rail network before the merger with Burlington Northern. The line dates back to 1887, and the first train arrived on July 28 in that year. The company has multiple parallel tracks (5+) running through central Ardmore (MP 450.5), added concomitantly with the rise of the trading status of the city and region throughout the early 1900s. There is also a lightly used transverse rail spur from the BNSF line to the Michelin tire plant in west Ardmore, mainly intended for the transport of raw materials to the factory. BNSF has given Site Certification to the Ameripointe Logistics Park in Ardmore, meaning the railroad has identified the location as an optimal rail-served site meeting ten economic development criteria, intended to minimize development risks customers may face.

===Mass transit===
The historic Santa Fe depot in downtown Ardmore is also a stop on Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot; train route, with daily service to and from Oklahoma City and Fort Worth.

Ardmore also has a scheduled stop on the Greyhound/Jefferson Bus Lines system.

&quot;Southern Oklahoma Rural Transportation System&quot; (SORTS) began operations in 1985, and offers full services to the four counties of Bryan, Carter, Coal and Love. The program currently offers demand response services with contract transportation provided for work routes, medical routes and rural routes meeting the needs of the entire area.

Early on, Ardmore had streetcars. The Ardmore Traction Company was organized in the Fall of 1905. It had pretentions of building all the way to Springer, Oklahoma, about 7 miles, but had a much smaller system operational around town by January 1, 1906. In January 1908 it built an additional 3 miles to the company-owned Lorena Park. But the company was in receivership by early 1910, when the system consisted of 4.7 miles of tracks in operation, 2 new single truck cars, 2 double truck cars, a convertible car, a summer car, and the amusement park. At some point it changed names to the Ardmore Electric Railway, and reorganizing again in 1916, ending up as the Ardmore Railway Company. By August 1918, the system was down to 4 cars and 3.37 miles of track. World War I gave the system a brief boom, but by 1920 it was losing $100-$400/month. Abandonment was requested and granted in 1922. The tracks were removed in the 1930’s as a WPA project.

<text>Gene Autry is a town in Carter County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 154 at the time of the 2020 census, down just slightly from the 158 reported in the 2010 census. It is part of the Ardmore, Oklahoma Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The town was originally named &quot;Lou&quot; by C.C. Henderson for his wife; the post office was established July 11, 1883. At the time of its founding, the community was located in Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation. On November 22, 1883, it was renamed &quot;Dresden&quot;. The name was changed to &quot;Berwyn&quot; on September 1, 1887, after Berwyn, Pennsylvania, making the Oklahoma town one of several along the Santa Fe railroad line through the Territory (re)named for stations on the &quot;Main Line&quot; of the Pennsylvania Railroad.

Finally, on November 16, 1941, it was renamed &quot;Gene Autry&quot; to honor the singer and motion picture star. Though Autry was born in Tioga, Texas, his family moved to Oklahoma while he was an infant. He was raised in the southern Oklahoma towns of Achille and Ravia. Autry had also worked as a telegraph operator near Berwyn. In 1939 he bought the Flying A Ranch on the west edge of Berwyn, and the town decided to honor him by changing its name. Approximately 35,000 people attended the ceremonies broadcast live from the site on Autry&#x27;s &quot;Melody Ranch&quot; radio show. Expectations that Autry would make his permanent home on the ranch were heightened when Autry’s house in California burned down just eight days before the name change ceremony, but were dashed 21 days after the ceremony with the attack on Pearl Harbor. Autry joined the military in 1942. He sold the ranch after the war. The ranch is now all but gone.

<text>Healdton is a city in Carter County, Oklahoma, United States. Its population was 2,788 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Ardmore micropolitan statistical area.

== History ==
A post office was established at Healdton, Indian Territory, on February 26, 1883. It was named for Charles H. Heald, a prominent resident. At the time of its founding, Healdton was located in Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation.

==Geography==
Healdton is located in western Carter County. Oklahoma State Highway 76 passes through the city, leading south to U.S. Route 70, west of Wilson and north to Oklahoma State Highway 53. Ardmore, the Carter County seat, is to the east via OK-76 and US-70.

Healdton Municipal Lake, just northeast of Healdton, boasts 7 miles of shoreline and 370 surface acres.

=== Geology ===

The Healdton Field, encompassing Healdton and located in the western portion of Carter County, produces from the Pennsylvanian Healdton sands of the Hoxbar Group and the Ordovician massive carbonate Arbuckle Group. The field is located on the Healdton uplift, a northwest-southeast trending anticline, which formed with the Wichita Orogeny, and is 8 mi long and up to 3 mi wide. This was followed by deposition of the Healdton sandstones and shales on pre-Pennsylvanian eroded rocks and subsequent folding during the Arbuckle Orogeny. A prospector named Palmer drilled a shallow well, 425 feet, near an oil seep in the 1890s, but federal law prohibited oil development on &quot;Indian lands&quot; until the early 1900s. Therefore, the discovery of the field is credited to the drilling of No. 1 Wirt Franklin in 1913.

<text>Tatums is a historic Freedmen&#x27;s town in Carter County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 151 at the 2010 census, a decline of 12.2 percent from the figure of 172 in 2000. It is part of the Ardmore, Oklahoma Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, Tatums was founded in Indian Territory in 1895 by Lee and Mary Tatum, though &quot;Oklahoma Place Names&quot; states that the town was not incorporated until May 9, 1896, And a hotel was built in 1899, a blacksmith shop in 1900,a cotton gin and sawmill in 1910, and a motor garage in 1918.Oil wells were drilled in the area in the 1920s,bringing wealth to several of Tatums&#x27;s farmers and landowners.

At the time of its founding, Tatums was located in Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation.

The town was one of more than fifty all-black towns founded in Oklahoma, and is one of thirteen still in existence. Lee Tatum was the first postmaster, ran a grocery store, and was a U.S. Marshal. Travelers who came through Tatums could stay at the home of Henry Taylor, who owned the largest home in town. Over the next few decades, other businesses were added to the town, including a church, school, hotel, blacksmith shop, a cotton gin and sawmill, and a motor garage. In the 1920s, oil wells were drilled around Tatums, and several residents richly profited from them.

A brick school funded by the Rosenwald Fund was completed in 1926. In 1927, Norman Studios filmed a silent movie, &quot;Black Gold&quot;, in Tatums. Marshal L. B. Tatums played a role in the film. No copy of the film is known to exist, but the script and camera are held by the Autry National Center in California.

The Great Depression greatly damaged Tatums&#x27; economy, so many residents migrated to urban areas. Amid the Depression, the Works Progress Administration built a new brick school in 1936.

<text>Tahlequah ( ; , ) is a city in Cherokee County, Oklahoma located at the foothills of the Ozark Mountains. It is part of the Green Country region of Oklahoma and was established as a capital of the 19th-century Cherokee Nation in 1839, as part of the new settlement in Indian Territory after the Cherokee Native Americans were forced west from the American Southeast on the Trail of Tears.

The city&#x27;s population was 15,753 at the 2010 census, an increase of 8.96 percent over the figure of 14,458 reported in 2000. The 2019 estimated population is 16,819.

Tahlequah is the capital of the two federally recognized Cherokee tribes based in Oklahoma, the modern Cherokee Nation and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians. Tahlequah is also the county seat of Cherokee County. The main campus of Northeastern State University is located in the city.

==History==
=== Background ===
Tahlonteeskee was the first established governmental capital of any kind in what was to become Oklahoma. It was established in 1828—in land that was part of 1816&#x27;s Lovely Donations, becoming the first Cherokee Nation–West capital city. It continued as the capital until 1839 when new arrivals from the Trail of Tears flooded the area. At that time, Takatoka briefly became the Nation&#x27;s capital during the construction of the capitol building at Tahlequah. By mid-1840, the seat of government had been officially moved to Tahlequah.

By 1842, Tahlequah was a growing community and had four stores. The town site of was surveyed in 1843, and in the same year an intertribal council attracted ten thousand participants representing 21 different tribes. In 1844 the National Hotel was built, and the newspaper &quot;Cherokee Advocate&quot; issued its first edition using a printing press installed in the brand-new Supreme Court building. The first school opened in 1845, and the Tahlequah post office opened in 1847. The Cherokee Male Seminary opened in 1851, offering higher education to Cherokee boys who had already received their primary education.

===Etymology===


Many linguists believe the word &#x27;Tahlequah&#x27; (Tah-le-quah) and the word &#x27;Teh-li-co&#x27; are the same as &#x27;di li gwa&#x27;, the Cherokee word for grain or rice. (See Cherokee Nation Lexicon (dikaneisdi) at cherokee.org under culture/language). Scholars report the Cherokee word &#x27;di li gwa&#x27; describes a type of native grain with a red hue that grew in the flat open areas of east Tennessee. One area, Great Tellico (Tellico Plains, Tennessee), was named for the grass with the red seed tops. Others interpret a word &#x27;tel-i-quah&#x27; as &#x27;plains&#x27;; however, there is no word for &#x27;plains&#x27; in the Cherokee lexicon, and the word &#x27;tel-i-quah&#x27; is not found in the lexicon. The idea that &#x27;tahlequah&#x27; means &#x27;plains&#x27; lends weight to the belief that the name refers to the wide open grassy areas of Great Tellico.

Local legend states the name is derived from Cherokee words &#x27;ta-li&#x27; and &#x27;ye-li-quu&#x27; meaning &#x27;just two&#x27; or &#x27;two is enough&#x27;. Supposedly three tribal elders had planned to meet to determine the location of the Cherokee Nation&#x27;s permanent capital. Two elders arrived and waited for the third. As dusk approached, they decided that &#x27;two is enough&#x27;, or &#x27;ta-li-ye-li-quu&#x27; which later became anglicanized to Tahlequah. According to tribal elders and Cherokee County elders, this legend first began to circulate in the 1930s. Tahlequah was a settlement as early as 1832. After the Western Cherokee agreed in 1834 to let the newer migrants settle near them, they joined their government with the Eastern Cherokee at Tahlequah in 1839. Tahlequah was named long before it was chosen as the Cherokee capital.

===Cherokee Nation capital===
In 1839, Tahlequah was designated the capital of ancestors of both the Cherokee Nation and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians. Initially the government buildings were a complex of log or framed structures. Most of these buildings were destroyed during the Civil War, during which the Cherokee became divided into two bitterly opposing sides. The Cherokee Supreme Court Building, located in downtown Tahlequah and constructed in 1844, is the oldest public building in Oklahoma.

Several markers of Cherokee and Native American heritage are found in town: street signs and business signs are noted in both the Cherokee language and English. Such signs use the syllabary created by Sequoyah, a Cherokee scholar of the 1820s who created the writing system.

===Post Civil War rebuilding and development===
After the war, a brick capitol was built and first occupied in 1870. In 1907, at the time of Oklahoma statehood, the building was converted into the Cherokee County courthouse. It was returned to the Cherokee Nation in 1970.

In 1886, the first telephone company in Indian Territory was built. The Cherokee Female Seminary, which had originally been constructed in Park Hill, burned in 1887, and was rebuilt in Tahlequah. After statehood, it was taken over by the state to become Northeastern State Normal School and the Northeastern State Teachers College (now Northeastern State University). The first bank in the Cherokee Nation opened in 1891 on Muskogee Avenue.

A major fire destroyed much of downtown Tahlequah in 1895. The buildings destroyed were mostly wooden and were replaced with brick structures.

In 1902, the Ozark and Cherokee Central Railway built a line into Tahlequah.

===Colleges===

Northeastern State University is the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of Oklahoma as well as one of the oldest institutions of higher learning west of the Mississippi River. Tahlequah is home to the capital of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and about 25 percent of the students at NSU identify themselves as American Indian. The university has many courses focused on Native American linguistics, and offers Cherokee language Education as a major. Cherokee can be studied as a second language, and some classes are taught in Cherokee for first language speakers as well.

==Culture==
===Cherokee National Supreme Court Museum===
The building that once housed the Supreme Court of the Cherokee Nation has been converted into a museum, the Cherokee National Supreme Court Museum and is open to the public. It reportedly is the oldest public building in Oklahoma. It was constructed on the southeast corner of the town square by James S. Pierce in 1844. The first chief justice of the Cherokee Nation, John Martin held court here. The printing press for the early-day &quot;Cherokee Phoenix&quot; newspaper was also located in this building, and a reproduction of the press and the newsroom can be seen here.

===Cherokee National History Museum===
The Cherokee National Capitol building was built on the town square in 1869. It contained the nation&#x27;s executive and legislative offices until the tribal national government was dissolved in 1906, in preparation for Oklahoma&#x27;s statehood. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and is designated as a National Landmark.

The museum contains of space for permanent exhibits and of rotating gallery space. Exhibits include not only works by Cherokee artists, but also artifacts loaned by the collections of the Cherokee Nation Archives, Gilcrease Museum, Smithsonian Institution and the Oklahoma Historical Society.

<text>Fort Towson is a town in Choctaw County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 510 at the 2010 census, a 15.1 percent decline from the figure of 611 recorded in 2000. It was named for nearby Fort Towson, which had been established in May 1824 and named for General Nathan Towson, a hero of the War of 1812. The town of Fort Towson was established in 1902, after the Arkansas and Choctaw Railway reached eastern Choctaw County.

==History==
The fort was first established to protect the southern border of the Indian Territory against Spanish colonies to the south. After Indian Removal and the resettlement of the Choctaw in the area, the fort was revived to protect Doaksville, a mile to the west. It became the economic capital of the Choctaw Nation. Fort Towson Landing was located at the head of navigable waters of the Red River. The site was located in Towson County, one of the constituent counties comprising the Apukshunnubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

The Choctaw allied with the Confederacy in the Civil War. Chief Peter Pitchlynn surrendered on behalf of the Choctaw in June 1865.

Fort Towson was the site of the surrender of the last Confederate land forces in the American Civil War. On June 23, 1865, Brigadier General Stand Watie, a Cherokee chief, agreed to terms and took his Choctaw Battalion out of the war.

During the 1950s, Raymond Gary Lake and Raymond Gary State Park were created, and in 1979, Fort Towson&#x27;s town limits were extended to include the lake&#x27;s residents. Thus, the 1980 census recorded a population of 789.

==Geography==

<text>Hugo is a city in and the county seat of Choctaw County, Oklahoma, United States. It is located in southeastern Oklahoma, approximately north of the Texas state line. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 5,166.

The city was founded in 1901 and named for the French novelist Victor Hugo. In the postwar 20th century, the city served as winter quarters for some circus companies and performers. A cemetery has a section for circus personnel. Nearby is one of the oldest boarding schools west of the Mississippi: Goodland Academy, begun in 1848 as a Presbyterian mission, school and orphanage for Native American children.

The town is located in a cultural area of the state known as Little Dixie, as it was settled by Native American tribes, African Americans and European Americans from the southeastern United States. It is within the tourist area designated as Choctaw Country by the Oklahoma Department of Tourism.

==History==

This was part of the Indian Territory to which the United States government relocated Native American tribes from east of the Mississippi River in the 1830s under its Indian Removal policy. Among the nations relocated here were the Choctaw, for whom the county is named. They were one of what were called the &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot; of the southeastern United States, as some of their people had adopted many elements of European-American culture. When they relocated, they brought with them the numerous enslaved African-Americans whom they held as workers and property.

As the majority of the Choctaw allied with the Confederate South during the American Civil War, the United States government insisted on a new peace treaty with them after its end. A condition was the Choctaws&#x27; emancipation of their slaves and granting to the freedmen of rights of full citizenship in the Choctaw nation, as the US was granting citizenship to former slaves of the South.

In 1902 the St. Louis, San Francisco and New Orleans Railroad (later the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway or &quot;Frisco&quot;) built a line from Hope, Arkansas, to Ardmore, Oklahoma. It crossed the north–south line Frisco had built in 1887 to connect Monett, Missouri, to Paris, Texas. The territorial town that sprang up at the crossing would soon be named Hugo. The town&#x27;s name was recommended by the wife of local surveyor W.H. Darrough, a fan of French writer Victor Hugo. At the time of its founding, Hugo was located in Kiamitia County, a part of the Pushmataha District of the Choctaw Nation.

As the end of the Indian Territory drew near, tribal citizens and other inhabitants organized an effort for the territory to be admitted to the Union as a state. The State of Sequoyah, which they proposed, divided the territories of the five tribes into counties. Hugo was designated as the county seat of Hitchcock County. Although neither Congress nor the president were interested in admitting Sequoyah as a state, the county boundaries proposed for Sequoyah were in some cases adopted for counties in the future state of Oklahoma.

In southeastern Oklahoma, the future Choctaw County&#x27;s boundaries were generally those of Hitchcock County, Sequoyah. Similarly, boundaries proposed for Pushmataha County, Sequoyah served, in general, as the boundaries for Pushmataha County, Oklahoma. And McCurtain County, Oklahoma generally follows the boundaries proposed for McCurtain County, Sequoyah. Both counties are adjacent to and share boundaries with Choctaw County.

==Statehood and changes==
When counties were reorganized to prepare Oklahoma for admission as a state, Hugo was designated as the county seat of the redefined Choctaw County, as it was already a population center in the area.

After allotments of communal tribal land to individual households of tribal members under the Dawes Act, the Choctaw Nation lost control of much of its land, which was purchased by European Americans.

==Circus City==
Beginning in 1941, when the Al G. Kelly and Miller Brothers Circus relocated to Hugo from Kansas, there have been circuses based in this city. The Kelly and Miller Brothers were recruited by Vernon and Jewell Pratt, a local couple who owned a grocery store. In return the circus offered free Sunday performances for many years.

Hugo became a popular wintering place for circus and rodeo companies, because of its mild climate. Townspeople and circus people formed relationships and collaborated on civic projects. An estimated twenty circuses at times were based in Hugo, and in 2018 three still operate here: Carson and Barnes, Kelly Miller, and Culpepper &amp; Merriweather. All are tent circuses that travel the region by road.

David Rawls (born 1948) grew up in a circus family, who performed with Famous Cole Circus. In addition to performing on trampoline with his brother, he later learned all aspects of the business. In 1984 he became owner/manager of his own show, Kelly Miller Circus. He sold it in 2009. During this period, he also had been selected as City Manager of Hugo for a time, and was elected and served as Mayor of the city at another time.

A portion of Mt. Olivet Cemetery was set aside as Showmen&#x27;s Rest: buried here were circus owner D. R. Miller and rodeo cowboys Freckles Brown, Lane Frost, and Todd Whatley.

==Late 20th century to present==

In late 1993, a number of violent incidents occurred. Before Christmas, a shootout took place in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Within one week in December, two fires occurred; the first was at the Booker T. Washington gymnasium on December 26. On December 28 a fire erupted in the central business district of Hugo, consuming five buildings and burning for four hours. The Belmont Hotel, which the area historical society was renovating, was destroyed. Area authorities suspected that the fires were arson.

===Points of interest===
In 1937, under the Works Progress Administration program for public art, artist Joseph Fleck painted an oil-on-canvas mural, titled &quot;The Red Man of Oklahoma Sees the First Stage Coach&quot;, in the United States post office in Hugo. This building is now used as the Oklahoma School System Administration Building. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department.

==Geography==
Hugo is located at the center of Choctaw County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.36%, is water. Hugo Lake on the Kiamichi River lies northeast of town, and Roebuck Lake, an oxbow former channel of the Red River, lies south of town.

Hugo is the southern terminus of the Indian Nation Turnpike, a four-lane highway that runs northwest to Interstate 40 in Henryetta. It provides a vital transportation link from southeastern Oklahoma to the state&#x27;s largest cities, Oklahoma City and Tulsa.

==Economy==
Agriculture (especially cotton farming), timber, and ranching have been mainstays of the city&#x27;s economy since its beginning. With industrial scale agriculture, mechanization replaced numerous farm jobs.

Since the 1940s, circuses have used Hugo as their winter quarters and some regional circuses have been based here. Their owners and performers have often gotten involved in civic life.

The changing economy and culture of the later 20th century resulted in the 1970s opening of the Kiamichi Technology Center and the &quot;Agriplex,&quot; originally the Choctaw County Agricultural Center.

==Government==
Hugo implemented a council-manager form of city government in 1995. Council members are elected from single-member districts, and hire a professional manager to oversee operations of the city.

==Transportation==
Hugo serves as the southern terminus of the Indian Nation Turnpike. U.S. Highway 70 runs west to east through the city and connects Hugo to Durant to the west and Idabel to the east. U.S. Highway 271 runs south out of the city and leads to Paris, Texas.

Hugo is served by the city-operated Stan Stamper Municipal Airport, with one runway. The airport has ten aircraft based on the field. It supports medical air ambulance operations by EagleMed, as well as scheduled cargo operations for all of southeastern Oklahoma, via a flight from Tulsa operated by Martinaire on behalf of UPS.

In the 1990s during a period of flood, the river moved again and Heroine reappeared in a riverbank. In 1999 the Oklahoma Historical Society and the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A&amp;M University collaborated on a dig of the site. The excavation occurred between 2001 and 2008. Reconstructed segments of the boat and its machinery, along with artifacts from the wreck, are now in the Oklahoma History Center in Oklahoma City.

<text>Boise City ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Cimarron County, in the Panhandle of Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,166 at the 2020 census, a decline of 7.9 percent from 1,266 in 2010.

==History==

Boise City was founded in 1908 by developers J. E. Stanley, A. J. Kline, and W. T. Douglas (all doing business as the Southwestern Immigration and Development Company of Guthrie, Oklahoma) who published and distributed brochures promoting the town as an elegant, tree-lined city with paved streets, numerous businesses, railroad service, and an artesian well. They sold 3,000 lots to buyers who discovered, on their arrival, that none of the information in the brochure was true. In addition to using false publicity, the three men did not have title to the lots they sold.

Stanley and Kline were convicted of mail fraud and sent to Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary. Stanley and Kline served two-year terms in the penitentiary. Douglas died of tuberculosis before beginning his sentence. Despite the fraud by the original developers, the town nevertheless took shape and was incorporated on July 20, 1925.

The &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot; says that the origin of the town name is unclear, but offers three possibilities: (1) a Captain Boice who was a hero in the Civil War, (2) the town of Boise, Idaho or (3) the Boise Cattle Company, which ran cattle in the area. It was speculated in Ken Burns&#x27; documentary, &quot;The Dust Bowl&quot;, that the town name was chosen as part of the original land scam to evoke a false image of the town, as &quot;boisé&quot; is French for &quot;wooded&quot;.

Boise City&#x27;s prosperity in the 1930s, like that of Cimarron County generally, was severely affected by its location at the heart of the Dust Bowl region.

Boise City was the location of an unusual event during World War II when it was mistakenly bombed by a friendly U.S. bomber crew during training. The bombing occurred on July 5, 1943, at approximately 12:30 a.m. by a B-17 Flying Fortress Bomber. This occurred because pilots performing target practice became disoriented and mistook the four lights centered around the town&#x27;s main square as their target. No one was killed in the attack and there was minimal damage, as only practice bombs with four pounds of dynamite and ninety pounds of sand were used and the square was deserted, but the pilots were embarrassed. For the 50th anniversary of the incident, the crew of the bomber was invited back to Boise City, but all members declined, some for health reasons and others because they did not want to draw more attention to their mishap. The B-17&#x27;s former radio operator did, however, send an audio tape that was played at the celebration.

<text>Hall Park is a neighborhood in Norman, Oklahoma. It was originally a town in Cleveland County, Oklahoma, United States and part of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area. It began in the 1960s and is named after the founder Ike Hall. At the time of the 2000 census, the town population was 1,088 prior to becoming part of the City of Norman.

Hall Park is notable for being established as Oklahoma&#x27;s first &quot;all-electric&quot; town. Ronald Reagan, then a spokesman for General Electric, visited Hall Park upon its opening and was bestowed an honorary mayoralty. Hall Park was unique in establishing common-area backyards, resulting in a lot of public space per square mile.

Financial and infrastructure troubles plagued Hall Park throughout its history. The arsenic groundwater regulations established in January 2001 resulted in Hall Park&#x27;s only independent water sources being declared in violation of federal drinking water standards.

In 2003, Hall Park was annexed by Norman, and ceased to be a town, becoming instead a group of housing subdivisions. Ike Hall&#x27;s daughter purchased the Hall Park water tower, which now sits in her yard.

==Geography==
Hall Park was located at (35.240885, -97.407018).

==History==

In 1835, north of the present town, Major Richard B. Mason established Camp Holmes. Here, the Five Civilized Tribes, many of the Plains Indians and the Osage Nation met and signed the treaty of Camp Holmes, pledging peace and friendship among themselves and the United States. Later, Auguste P. Chouteau established a trading post here and renamed the place Camp Mason. Jesse Chisholm operated a store here.

The area of Lexington was in the Unassigned Lands, and the town was planned before the Land Rush of 1889. The town was named after Lexington, Kentucky. The post office was established in 1890.

The first incorporation of Lexington in 1890 was dissolved after political infighting and a dispute over high taxes on liquor sales. After a compromise was reached, the town reincorporated in 1892.

Before Oklahoma statehood in 1907, Lexington was known as a &quot;whiskey town&quot;. Much of the business came from across the Canadian River from the thriving railroad town of Purcell which was located in dry Indian Territory. The Weitzenhoffer and Turk Distillery, the largest distillery in Oklahoma Territory, opened near Lexington in 1900 and operated until statewide prohibition in 1907.

During World War II, the Navy operated a gunnery school east of Lexington. After the war, the State of Oklahoma acquired the property and built an annex to Central State Mental Hospital (later Griffin Memorial Hospital). In 1971, the Department of Corrections acquired the property and opened a minimum security prison called the Regional Treatment Center. In 1976, the state began construction on the Lexington Assessment and Reception Center (LARC) which processes all new prisoners entering the state correctional system. The Regional Treatment Center was re-designated as the Joseph Harp Correctional Center, a medium-security prison.

==US 77 James C. Nance Bridge between Lexington and Purcell==

The US 77 James C. Nance Memorial Bridge connecting Purcell and Lexington was originally built as a circa 1938 deck truss two-lane bridge, and in 2019, rebuilt as a concrete pier four-lane bridge crossing the Canadian River between Purcell and Lexington, Oklahoma. The bridge carries U.S. Route 77 (US-77) and Oklahoma State Highway 39 (SH-39) from McClain County to Cleveland County. The bridge is named for James C. Nance, longtime community newspaper chain publisher and Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives, President pro tempore of the Oklahoma Senate and member of U.S Uniform Law Commission.

The Nance bridge allows travel time from Purcell (west side of the Canadian river) to Lexingon (East side of the river) to be only 3 minutes by car, according to google maps. When the bridge was closed (Emergency Closure, below), the same trip was 43 minutes when re-routed North to the nearest bridge, or 1 hour and 4 minutes when re-routed Southeast to the nearest bridge.

The 1938 construction of this bridge enabled communities from West and Southwest (Byars, Cole, Dibble, Paoli, Pauls Valley, Purcell, Rosedale, and Wayne) side of the river to reach the communities on the East side of the river (Lexington, Slaughterville, and Wanette). Traffic using the bridge allows trade and commerce to freely flow in this retail trade area of southern McClain County, southern Cleveland County, Southern Pottawatomie County, and northern area of Garvin County, and eastern portion of Grady county. The 2019 rebuilt bridge features the same design elements with concrete post and original circa 1938 design wrought iron railings which provide a separate pedestrian walkway offering sweeping views of the South Canadian River valley.

According to the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, &quot;History was made Friday July 26, 2019 in Purcell and Lexington, just as it was more than 80 years ago when the two cities celebrated the grand opening of a new bridge connecting their communities. The new US 77 James C. Nance Memorial Bridge that links the twin cities, located less than one mile apart, fully opened to traffic with much fanfare on Friday, July 26, 2019, the culmination of a major two-year, expedited reconstruction project.&quot;

<doc id="130116" wikidata="Q917458" url="?curid=130116" title="Moore, Oklahoma">
<text>Moore is a city in Cleveland County, Oklahoma, United States, and is part of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. The population was 62,793 at the 2020 census, making Moore the seventh-largest city in the state of Oklahoma.

Located between Oklahoma City and Norman, the city has been the site of several devastating tornadoes, with those occurring in 1999 and 2013 receiving international attention. The 3 costliest tornadoes in Oklahoma history all occurred in Moore.

==History==
The Moore post office was established May 27, 1889, during the Land Run of 1889 and was named for Al Moore, an Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway employee. According to the town history he was a &quot;conductor or a brakeman, lived in a boxcar at the camp and had difficulty receiving his mail. He painted his name – &quot;Moore&quot; – on a board and nailed it on the boxcar. When a postmaster was appointed, he continued to call the settlement Moore. When the town incorporated in 1893 the name was legalized.&quot;

The city&#x27;s history notes that the community before the post office may have been called &quot;Verbeck&quot; by the railroad. However, other histories indicate that Verbeck was actually the original name of the nearby telegraph station &quot;Oklahoma&quot; which became the basis for the founding of Oklahoma City.

The community remained small until 1961, when it annexed , becoming a full-fledged city in 1962, which in turn increased its population from 1,221 in 1960 to 18,761 in 1970 and 55,081 in 2010. Moore&#x27;s 1961 annexation kept it an independent city at a time when Oklahoma City through annexations increased its size from to surrounding Moore on three sides (north, east, west). Norman forms its southern border.

In 1966 the Hillsdale Free Will Baptist College, after moving through various locations around Oklahoma, opened in the community.

The Moore post office turned into a branch of the Oklahoma City post office on January 7, 1972.

In the 1970s the city launched a &quot;Smile America&quot; campaign in which giant red, white and blue smileys were painted on the town water towers. A smiley also adorns the city&#x27;s official logo (as does a water tower). Some of the water towers now have a sign that says, &quot;Moore - Home of Toby Keith.&quot;

On September 24, 2014, at the local Vaughan Foods food processing plant, one employee was beheaded with a knife and another coworker had her throat slit and was injured, but survived. The alleged attacker, 30-year-old Alton Nolen, who was on suspension from the plant prior to the attack due to interactions with the employee who survived the attack, was shot and wounded by company owner Mark Vaughan. Nolen was convicted of murder and assault in October 2017. A jury recommended that he receive the death penalty, and, on December 15, 2017, a judge sentenced Nolen to death by lethal injection.

==Geography==
Moore is located just south of Oklahoma City and north of Norman, in central Oklahoma. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.52%, is water.

The city lies in the Sandstone Hills region of Oklahoma, known for hills, blackjack oak, and post oak.

==Climate==
Moore has a humid subtropical climate with frequent variations in weather during part of the year and consistently hot summers. Prolonged and heavy rainfall often leads to flash flooding. Consistent winds, usually from the south or south-southeast during the summer, help temper the hotter weather. Consistent northerly winds during the winter can intensify cold periods. Severe ice storms and snowstorms happen sporadically during the winter.

===Tornado history===

The Oklahoma City metropolitan area (of which Moore is a part) is located in Tornado Alley and is subject to frequent and severe tornadoes and hailstorms, making it one of the most tornado-prone major metropolitan areas in the world. Due to this, Moore is sometimes considered the Tornado Capital of either the United States or the world.

Moore itself has seen nine tornadoes between 1998 and 2015, three of them big enough to claim lives and cause catastrophic damage. The city of Moore was damaged by significant tornadoes on October 4, 1998; May 3, 1999; May 8, 2003; May 10, 2010; and May 20, 2013, with weaker tornadoes striking at other times, notably May 31, 2013 and March 25, 2015. Moore is located in Tornado Alley, a colloquial term for the area of the United States where tornadoes are most frequent. About 20 tornadoes occurred in the immediate vicinity of Moore from 1890 to 2013. The most significant tornadoes to hit Moore occurred in 1893, 1999, and 2013.

To warn residents of tornadoes, 44 siren warning devices have been densely installed throughout Moore.

====1999 tornado====

During the tornado outbreak on May 3, 1999, a tornado hit Moore and nearby areas. The tornado, which was rated an F5 on the Fujita scale, was the most costly tornado in history at the time (not adjusted for changes in inflation and population). The tornado had an approximate recorded wind speed of as sampled by mobile Doppler radar, the highest wind speed ever recorded on Earth. It left a swath of destruction over wide at times, and long. It killed a total of 36 people in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. This was the deadliest F5 tornado recorded since the Delhi, Louisiana tornado in 1971 until this mark was eclipsed by several tornadoes in 2011.

====2013 tornado====


On May 20, 2013, parts of Moore and neighboring Newcastle and southern Oklahoma City, were affected by a violent tornado. Classified as EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, it had estimated wind speeds of , a maximum width of , and a path length of . Entire subdivisions were destroyed; the tornado struck Briarwood and Plaza Towers elementary schools in Moore while school was in session. The Oklahoma Medical Examiner&#x27;s office reported that 24 people were killed, including 10 children. Over 140 patients, including at least 70 children, were treated at hospitals following the tornado. It was the deadliest U.S. tornado since the Joplin, Missouri tornado that killed 158 people in 2011.

Moore Public Schools has three high schools: Moore, Southmoore, and Westmoore; six junior high schools: Brink, Central, Highland East, Highland West, Moore West, and Southridge; and 25 elementary schools: Apple Creek, Briarwood, Broadmoore, Bryant, Central, Earlywine, Eastlake, Fairview, Fisher, Heritage Trails, Houchin, Kelley, Kingsgate, Northmoor, Oakridge, Plaza Towers, Red Oak, Santa Fe, Sky Ranch, Sooner, South Lake, Southgate-Rippetoe, Timber Creek, Wayland Anders Bonds and Winding Creek.

On May 20, 2013, while classes were in progress, several of Moore&#x27;s schools were damaged or destroyed by the 2013 Moore Tornado, most notably Plaza Towers Elementary, Briarwood Elementary and Highland East Junior High. However, these schools were rebuilt and reopened for the 2014–15 school year.

===Libraries===
Moore is served by the Moore Public Library, which is part of the Pioneer Library System.

==Media==
Three media outlets focus on the Moore community. 19th Street Magazine publishes a free issue every month focusing on high school sports, community events and local businesses. Moore Monthly publishes a free monthly print publication while its website provides daily stories and videos about Moore, Norman and south Oklahoma City. The other media outlet is the Moore American.

==Moore Veterans Memorial==
The City of Moore has funded the construction of a memorial to honor America&#x27;s veterans and their families. The city renamed JD Estates Park to Veterans Memorial Park, and a memorial was constructed at the park entrance.

The main feature of the memorial is a black granite obelisk that has the inscription, &quot;May this hallowed ground honor the sacrifice of America&#x27;s finest veterans, civilians, and their families- past, present, and future. We will never forget.&quot; Another major feature of the memorial are five black granite tablets with the seal of the five branches of the American armed forces. At the center of the memorial is a flag plaza with a pole for the American flag and two poles for the Oklahoma flag and the POW/MIA flag. The flag plaza is surrounded by a polished concrete walking area with a stained five-pointed star stretching the entire width and height of the walking area.

A committee was formed to plan the second phase of the Moore Veterans Memorial. A campaign to sell bricks to be placed in the memorial was completed in early 2009. Over 190 bricks were purchased by supporters from the community and surrounding areas. The bricks were placed in the Memorial Wall and Phase II was completed in May 2009.

The Soldiers&#x27; Memorial was dedicated on May 15, 2010. It consists of four carved wooden soldiers representing the four major wars since the end of World War I. They include World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and the Afghanistan/Iraq War.

After being destroyed by the May 2013 tornado, the park won the title of &quot;America&#x27;s Favorite Park&quot; in an online competition sponsored by Coca-Cola, beating out numerous other parks from around the country. First prize was a $100,000 grant, which was combined with other funds to cover the estimated $200,000 in rebuilding expenses. The first steps toward rebuilding began in November 2013, during a groundbreaking ceremony and the awarding of the grant to Mayor Glenn Lewis. The park&#x27;s playgrounds are now open to the public.

<text>Noble is a city in Cleveland County, Oklahoma, United States, and is part of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area. The population was 6,985 at the 2020 census, a 7.8% increase from 2010. Noble is Cleveland County&#x27;s third-largest city behind Norman and Moore.

==History==
On April 22, 1889, the day the first Oklahoma &quot;Land Run&quot; opened the Unassigned Lands in the middle of Indian Territory to settlers, J.W. Klinglesmith, Albert Rennie and several other businessmen forded the South Canadian River and laid claim to the town site that was to become Noble. The town was named in honor of Secretary of the Interior John Noble, who was instrumental in opening the Unassigned Lands to settlement. The group had great plans for Noble, hoping it would become the future county seat.

The Santa Fe Railroad completed a railroad depot in Noble in August 1889. For several years, Noble was a major shipping point for cattle and other goods from both sides of the Canadian River. Business prospered even more when Charles Edwin Garee built a new suspension toll bridge across the Canadian River in 1898.

The suspension bridge washed out in 1904 and other communities began developing nearby. The last passenger train stopped in Noble in 1944 and the depot was moved.

===Rose Rock Capital of the World===

Noble considers itself to be the &quot;Rose Rock Capital of the World&quot;, as the concentration of barium sulfate in the soil is believed to be higher there than anywhere else, causing the formation of rose rocks. Similar formations are found throughout Cleveland County and the Wichita and Ouachita Mountains. Noble sets aside the first Saturday each May to celebrate its annual Rose Rock Festival. Local geologist Joe Stine and his wife opened the Timberlake Rose Rock Museum in 1986 and closed it in 2019.

==Geography==
Noble is located along the southwest edge of Cleveland County. It is bordered to the north by Norman, to the east by Slaughterville, and to the west by the Canadian River, across which is McClain County. U.S. Route 77 passes through Noble, leading north to the center of Oklahoma City and south to Purcell.

==Government==

==Education==

The Noble Public Schools&#x27; district (Independent #40 as numbered by the state) covers a huge area, stretching west to east across south-central Cleveland County between Norman and Little Axe school districts to the north and Lexington&#x27;s to the south. Currently the district has three elementary schools, one middle school, and one high school.

The elementary school for children in kindergarten through first grade is the Katherine I. Daily Elementary School, named after the longtime principal. The current principal of &quot;K.I.D.,&quot; as it is commonly called, is Janice Busick. The next school in the Noble Public School system is the John Hubbard Elementary School, named for the longtime district superintendent from the 1950s-70s, and educates children in second and third grade. Nathan Gray is the principal.

Following their two years at Hubbard, children attend the Pioneer Intermediate School for fourth and fifth grades. Pioneer formerly educated sixth graders; however, they now attend the recently completed Noble Middle School. Nathan Gray is the principal and is serving his 4th year in this position.

Until recently, children went to Noble Junior High for seventh through eighth grade. However, the building that used to be the junior high is now Noble Public School&#x27;s administration building. Noble Middle School was built, and educates students in sixth through eighth grade. When the superintendent, Curtis Inge, died they renamed the school The Curtis Inge Middle School. The principal is Roger Clements and assistant principal is Kristal Standridge.

Noble High School, with the Bears as its mascot, is where children finish their secondary education in Noble. 
The schools&#x27; athletic programs compete in Oklahoma&#x27;s class 5A in most sports, including football, basketball, baseball, and golf. The wrestling team competes in class 4A. Frank Solomon is the head principal while Steve Barrett and Mike Barefoot serve as assistant principals.

Noble High is also home to many clubs, programs and extra-curricular activities, such as a class 5A marching band under the direction of Fred Queen, or BotBall led by Cole, which earned the Rookie Team Award at GCER 2019. Over the decades since the district and High School grew to their modern size in the 1970s, various programs in newspaper, yearbook, vocal music, Student Council, FFA and others have held statewide office and been leaders in their fields.

The Noble Public Schools Foundation Board for Academic Excellence has initiated a &quot;50 for 50&quot; campaign to raise $50,000 a year for endowment to benefit Noble students by funding teacher grants. As of June 2015 they have raised over $165,000.00.

The Noble Public Schools&#x27; district is far larger in area than the boundary limits of the City of Noble proper, owing to the closure and consolidation of all the original small dependent schools in the 1940s-60s. This means that students come from the north half of Slaughterville as well as Noble and unincorporated areas, and even a strip of rural south Norman. Formally dating to only 1970, the Town of Slaughterville never carved out its own school district, and its residents&#x27; children attend either Noble, Lexington, or are home-schooled.

It is the most populous city and the county seat of Cleveland County and the second-most populous city in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area after the state capital, Oklahoma City, 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Norman.

The city was settled during the Land Run of 1889, which opened the former Unassigned Lands of Indian Territory to American pioneer settlement. It was named in honor of Abner Norman, the area&#x27;s initial land surveyor, and was formally incorporated on , 1891. Norman has prominent higher education and related research industries, as it is home to the University of Oklahoma, the largest university in the state, with nearly 32,000 students. The university is well known for its sporting events by teams under the banner of the nickname &quot;Sooners&quot;, with over 85,000 people routinely attending football games. The university is home to several museums, including the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art, which contains the largest collection of French Impressionist art ever given to an American university, as well as the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History.

Norman&#x27;s National Weather Center (NWC) houses a unique collection of university, state, federal, and private-sector organizations that work together to improve the understanding of events related to the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Norman lies within Tornado Alley, a geographic region colloquially known for frequent and intense tornadic activity. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC), a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that delivers forecasts for severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, and other high-impact hazardous weather in the contiguous United States, is located at the NWC. Additionally, research is conducted at the co-located National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL), which operates various experimental weather radars and develops innovative tools, applications, and techniques aimed at improving forecasts and warnings of severe weather.

==History==


The Oklahoma region became part of the United States with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Before the American Civil War, the U.S. government began relocating the Five Civilized Tribes—the five Native American tribes that the United States officially recognized via treaty—to Oklahoma. Treaties of 1832 and 1833 assigned the area known today as Norman to the Creek Nation.

After the Civil War, the Creeks were accused of aiding the Confederacy; as a result they ceded the region back to the United States in 1866. In the early 1870s, the federal government undertook a survey of these unassigned lands. Abner Ernest Norman, a 23-year-old surveyor from Kentucky, was hired to oversee part of this project. Norman&#x27;s work crew set up camp near what is today the corner of Classen Boulevard and Lindsey Street; it was there that the men, perhaps jokingly, carved a sign on an elm tree that read &quot;Norman&#x27;s Camp,&quot; in honor of their young boss. In 1887, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway began service to the area, which was later opened to settlement as part of the Land Run of 1889; early settlers decided to keep the name &quot;Norman.&quot;

On , 1889, that first Land Run in what would become the state of Oklahoma saw the founding of Norman, with at least 150 residents spending the night in makeshift campsites, and by the next morning a downtown was already being constructed. Almost immediately two prominent Norman businessmen, former Purcell railroad freight agent Delbert Larsh and railroad station chief cashier Thomas Waggoner, began lobbying for the territorial government to locate its first university in Norman. The two were interested in growing the city and had reasoned that, rather than try to influence territorial lawmakers to locate the heavily contested territory capital in Norman, it made sense to attempt to secure the state&#x27;s first university instead (a move that would be far less controversial). On , 1890, Larsh and Waggoner were successful with the passage of Territorial Council Bill 114, establishing the University of Oklahoma in Norman about 18 years before Oklahoma statehood.

The City of Norman was formally incorporated on , 1891.

The new Norman was a sundown town. African Americans were not allowed to live within the city limits or stay overnight until the early 1960s, nor could they study at the University of Oklahoma. In 2020, the Norman City Council issued an apology.

Norman has grown throughout the decades. By 1902 the downtown district contained two banks, two hotels, a flour mill, and other businesses; by 1913 over 3,700 people lived in Norman when the Oklahoma Railway Company decided to extend its interurban streetcar running from Oklahoma City to Moore into Norman, spurring additional population growth. The rail lines eventually transitioned to freight during the 1940s as the United States Numbered Highway system developed. The population reached 11,429 in 1940.

With the completion of Interstate 35 in June 1959, Norman found its role as a bedroom community to Oklahoma City increasing rapidly; in 1960 Norman&#x27;s population was 33,412 but by the end of the decade had grown to 52,117. Throughout the 1960s Norman&#x27;s land mass increased by by annexing surrounding areas. The city&#x27;s growth trends have continued early in the 21st century, with the population reaching 95,694 in 2000, 110,925 in 2010, and 128,026 in 2020.

===Military in Norman===
In 1941, the University of Oklahoma and Norman city officials established Max Westheimer Field, a university airstrip, and then leased it to the U.S. Navy as a Naval Flight Training Center in 1942. It became the Naval Air Station Norman, and it was used for training combat pilots during World War II. A second training center, known as Naval Air Technical Training Center, and a naval hospital were later established to the south. In the years following World War II the airstrip was transferred back to the university&#x27;s control. Today the airstrip is called the University of Oklahoma Westheimer Airport. Following the war the remaining military presence and post-war veterans who came to Norman to get an education again grew the city&#x27;s population, which was 27,006 by 1950. The Navy again utilized the bases in a lesser capacity from 1952 to 1959 in support of the Korean War effort.

Although Norman currently has no light rail or commuter rail service, there is growing interest in incorporating such services into the city&#x27;s future transportation plans as part of the Oklahoma City metro area&#x27;s regional transit system.

====Roads and highways====
The predominant form of transportation in Norman is roads and highways with 80.0% of all residents driving alone to work, 9.0% carpooling, and just 1.3% taking public transportation. As of 2007, Interstate 35 alone was handling over 99,000 vehicles per day. Other major highways include State Highway 9, a portion of which serves 28,000 vehicles per day, and U.S. Highway 77, which serves more than 25,000 vehicles per day.

Norman is served by two major federal highways:
* Interstate 35
* U.S. Highway 77

Norman is served by two major Oklahoma state highways:
* State Highway 9
* State Highway 77H

===Utilities===
Electric utility companies servicing Norman include Oklahoma Gas &amp; Electric, which is headquartered in Oklahoma City, and Oklahoma Electric Cooperative (a utility cooperative). Natural gas is provided by Oklahoma Natural Gas. The city&#x27;s Utility Department offers water, wastewater, and recycling services to parts of the city as well as solid waste pickup citywide.

====Drinking water quality====
In 2010, drinking water in Normal was identified as levels of hexavalent chromium 3 and 6 near the higher end of the acceptable EPA limit. The Garber-Wellington Aquifer, which is known to have elevated levels of heavy metals, was identified as a possible source. Norman&#x27;s water supply has also been noted for excessive levels of arsenic. The city responded by building new wells and removing old ones.

===Healthcare===

Norman Regional Health System is a multi-campus system that provides medical services in Norman and throughout south central Oklahoma. Its Porter Avenue campus, located north of downtown Norman, is a 337-bed general hospital providing a wide range of services including acute care. In October 2009, the Norman Regional HealthPlex campus opened in west Norman. It provides a 152-bed facility specializing in cardiology, cardiovascular services, as well as women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s services.

<text>Coalgate is a city in and the county seat of Coal County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,967 at the 2010 census, a 1.9 percent decrease from the figure of 2,005 recorded in 2000. The town was founded in 1889 in the Choctaw Nation, Indian Territory as a coal mining camp named Liddle. The name changed to Coalgate on January 23, 1890.

==History==
Coalgate was founded in 1889 as a coal mining camp named Liddle in Atoka County, a territorial-era county in the Pushmataha District of the Choctaw Nation, Indian Territory. It was named for William &quot;Bill&quot; Liddle, a superintendent for the Atoka Coal and Mining Company, who had arrived in the fall of 1888 to locate a site for a new coal mine. The Southwestern Coal and Improvement Company, a subsidiary of the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway (MK&amp;T) developed the site. A tent city sprung up, followed by company-built houses. Work on the mine started January 2, 1889, and the first shipment of coal left Liddle on April 17, 1889. The town name changed to Coalgate on January 23, 1890. The new name was taken from the steel gate or &quot;coal gate&quot; that separated the trains from the coal mines north of town. Coalgate incorporated under the laws of Arkansas on November 25, 1898. It was platted and approved by the Secretary of the Interior on December 16, 1903.

Coal County was created at statehood in 1907. Initially, Lehigh, Oklahoma was designated as county seat. However, a special election held on June 2, 1908, moved the seat to Coalgate. A new charter was approved on June 16, 1914.

Coalgate had grown to a population of 2,921 by statehood in 1907 and in one year the population had increased to 3,500. The city had at least 65 merchants plus carpenters, doctors, veterinarians, and as many as seven attorneys and three newspapers. The streets in the downtown area were bricked in 1912. In 1911, the weekly newspaper &quot;Coalgate Record Register&quot; was first published in Coalgate. Robinson Publishing Company took over publication of the newspaper in 1988. It has a circulation of 2,300.

Coalgate was the site of the very first bank closing performed by the State of Oklahoma when the International Bank of Coalgate was closed on May 21, 1908, and Herman C. Schultz, acting as an Assistant State Bank Commissioner, liquidated the bank, paying off all depositors in full and returning the excess to the bank&#x27;s shareholders.

During the May–June 1917 tornado outbreak sequence, at 4 p.m. on June 1, 1917, Coalgate was struck by an F4 tornado. The Westward school building and over 200 homes were destroyed. At least 11 people were killed.

The city prospered until the 1920s, when the coal mines closed because of worker strikes. Since this time agriculture and manufacturing have become the leading industries. From 1921 to 1923, local cotton crops were destroyed by a boll weevil infestation, and all five banks in the county closed. Coalgate&#x27;s population peaked at 3,009 at the 1920 census and has never recovered.

Coalgate survived the Great Depression, although many of its businesses did not. After President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s election, various Federal programs, such as the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), National Youth Administration (NYA), and Works Progress Administration (WPA), helped buoy the city&#x27;s struggling economy. The onset of World War II brought a temporary respite to the coal industry. However, these mines closed by 1958.

<text>Lehigh is a city in Coal County, Oklahoma, United States. Its population was 356 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Lehigh began as the first mining camp in what is now Coal County, Oklahoma. At the time of its founding, Lehigh was located in Atoka County, Choctaw Nation. It was originally named Boone, but the name was changed to Lehigh. The new name was taken from Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, a coal-mining region.

A post office opened in Lehigh, Indian Territory, on April 4, 1882, and several railroads built lines to Lehigh, including the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, and the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway. In addition to mining, ranching was an important contributor to the local economy. Stockyards were built in 1884 and, even as they neared completion, 23 railroad cars of cattle and seven carloads of hogs awaited shipping.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Lehigh was a growing settlement that greatly profited from the coal mines surrounding it. During the 1910s and 1920s, the demand for coal lessened as railroads switched to oil-powered trains. The mines eventually closed, and in the early 1920s, boll weevils destroyed the cotton crops in the area. Many businesses closed, and people left the town. The Merchants National Bank Building in Lehigh is the only structure that remains from the once-prosperous downtown area.

==Geography==
Lehigh is located in southeastern Coal County. U.S. Route 75 passes through the city, leading north to Coalgate, the county seat, and southeast to Atoka.

==1984 bank robbery==
Geronimo was the scene of one of the deadliest bank robberies in recent Oklahoma history on December 14, 1984. Shortly after 1 p.m., Jay Wesley Neill entered the First Bank of Chattanooga in Geronimo, and forced the three tellers to the back room, where he had them lie face down on the floor and stabbed them to death. The three employees (Kay Bruno, 42; Jerri Bowles, 19; Joyce Mullenix, 25) were stabbed a total of 75 times. Mullenix was six months pregnant.

Three customers entered the bank while Neill was attempting to decapitate one of the tellers. The customers were taken to the back room and shot in the head. Ralph Zeller, 33, died from his wounds, becoming the fourth and final murder victim. Bellen Robels, 15, and her husband Reuben Robels, 20, would recover from their head wounds. Neill attempted to shoot the couple&#x27;s 14-month-old daughter, Marie, but the gun was out of bullets.

Neill and accomplice Robert Grady Johnson were arrested on December 17 at the Holiday Inn in downtown San Francisco. Marked bills were used to pay for hotel rooms, limousine rides and shopping excursions. $3,700 were left on Neill and in the hotel room. Upon their extradition back to Comanche County, OK, then-District Attorney Dick Tannery prosecuted both defendants for capital murder and sought death sentences.

In 1985, Neill and Johnson were both convicted by a Comanche County jury in Lawton of the crimes related to the robbery and murders and assessed the death penalty. Technicalities in the original trial later resulted in both defendants being retried separately with both again convicted. Those convictions affirmed Neill&#x27;s death sentence and Johnson&#x27;s death sentence was changed to four life prison sentences with the possibility of parole. Neill was executed by lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester in November 2002, while Johnson continues to be incarcerated at the same correctional facility.

<text>Lawton is a city in and the county seat of Comanche County, in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. Located in western Oklahoma, approximately southwest of Oklahoma City, it is the principal city of the Lawton, Oklahoma, metropolitan statistical area. According to the 2020 census, Lawton&#x27;s population was 90,381, making it the sixth-largest city in the state, and the largest in Western Oklahoma.

Developed on former reservation lands of the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache peoples, Lawton was incorporated in 1901. It was named after Major General Henry Ware Lawton, who served in the Civil War, where he earned the Medal of Honor, and was killed in action in the Philippine–American War. Lawton&#x27;s landscape is typical of the Great Plains, with flat topography and gently rolling hills, while the area north of the city is marked by the Wichita Mountains.

The city&#x27;s proximity to the Fort Sill Military Reservation, formerly the base of the Apache territory before statehood, gave Lawton economic and population stability throughout the 20th century.

Although Lawton&#x27;s economy is still largely dependent on Fort Sill, it has grown to encompass manufacturing, higher education, health care, and retail. The city has a council-manager government; the city council members are elected from single-member districts and the mayor is elected at-large. They hire a professional city manager to direct daily operations.

Interstate 44 and three major United States highways serve the city, Lawton-Fort Sill Regional Airport connects Lawton by air, while Greyhound Lines and the Lawton Area Transit System provide intercity and local bus service respectively.

==History==

The territory of present-day Oklahoma was long settled by ancient cultures of prehistoric American Indians, including the Clovis, 11500 BCE; Folsom, 10600 BCE; and Plainview, 10000 BCE cultures.

The valleys of the Arkansas River and Red River were the center of Caddoan Mississippian culture, which began to develop about 800 CE. The people developed more dense settlement and a complex architecture of earthwork platform mounds. Archeological evidence has shown that these people were the direct ancestors of the historic Caddoan-language peoples who inhabited the larger region, including the Caddo and the Wichita peoples.

In the 16th century, Spanish explorer Francisco Vásquez de Coronado visited in 1541, beginning European contact. Around the 1700s, two tribes from the north, the Comanche and Kiowa, migrated to the Oklahoma and Texas regions.

For most of the 18th century, the French exerted nominal control over the Oklahoma region as part of French Louisiana. The largest French settlements were along the Gulf Coast, in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Mobile, Alabama. The limited interaction between the Native American and European peoples was based on fur trading.

In 1803, the French sold this territory as Louisiana Purchase to the US, under President Thomas Jefferson. European Americans continued to migrate into the Southeast and across the Mississippi River into Indian territories, especially seeking territory to expand cotton cultivation, which was a lucrative commodity crop. They pressured the government to give them access to Indian lands. In 1830, under President Andrew Jackson, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which removed American Indian tribes from the Southeast and relocated them to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River.

The southern part of this territory was originally assigned to the Choctaw and Chickasaw. Following the Civil War, during which most of the Southeast tribes had allied with the Confederacy, in 1867, the United States required new treaties of peace. In 1867, under the Medicine Lodge Treaty, it allotted the southwest portion of former Choctaw and Chickasaw lands to the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache tribes. It had forced them to move out of East Texas and nearby areas of Arkansas.

Fort Sill was established in 1869 after the American Civil War and commanded by Major General Philip Sheridan. He was leading a campaign in Indian Territory to stop raids into Texas by American Indian tribes. In 1874, the Red River War broke out in the region when the Comanche, Kiowa, and Southern Cheyenne left their Indian Territory reservation. Attrition and skirmishes by the US Army finally forced the return of the tribes to Indian Territory in June 1875.

In 1891, the United States Congress appointed a commission to meet with the tribal leaders and come to an agreement allowing White settlement. Years of controversy and legal maneuvering ensued before President William McKinley issued a proclamation on 4 July 1901, that gave the federal government control over of &quot;surplus&quot; Indian lands that remained after allotments of communal tribal lands to individual households under the Dawes Act. Under other legislation, the United States through the Dawes Commission allotted communal lands as plots to individual households of tribal members, selling off what remained as &quot;surplus&quot;. These actions extinguished the tribal claims to communal lands, a condition needed for the admission of Oklahoma as a state in 1907.
After these changes, the legislature of the new state began to organize counties. Three 320-acre sites in Kiowa, Caddo and Comanche counties were selected for county seats. Lawton was designated as the Comanche County seat. The town was named for Major General Henry W. Lawton, a quartermaster at Fort Sill, who had taken part in the pursuit and capture of Apache chief Geronimo.

The city was opened to settlement through an auction of town lots beginning on 6 August 1901, which was completed 60 days later. By 25 September 1901, the Rock Island Railroad expanded to Lawton and was soon joined by the Frisco Line. The first city elections were held 24 October 1901.

The United States&#x27; entry into World War I accelerated development at Fort Sill and Lawton. The availability of of water from Lake Lawtonka, just north of Fort Sill, was a catalyst for the War Department to establish a major cantonment named Camp Doniphan. It was active until 1922.

Similarly, the US response in World War II stimulated activity and expansion at Fort Sill and Lawton. The city&#x27;s population increased from 18,055 to 34,757 from 1940 to 1950. By the 1960s, it had reached 61,697.

In the postwar period, Lawton underwent tremendous growth during the late 1940s and 1950s, leading city officials to seek additional water sources to supplement existing water from Lake Lawtonka. In the late 1950s, the city purchased large parcels of land along East Cache Creek in northern Comanche County for the construction of a dam and human-made lake, built in 1959 on the creek just north of U.S. 277 west of Elgin. Lake Ellsworth, named for a former Lawton mayor, soft-drink bottler C.R. Ellsworth, was dedicated in the early 1960s. It offered additional water resources, but also recreational opportunities and flood control along Cache Creek.

In 1966, the Lawton City Council annexed several square miles of land on the city&#x27;s east, northeast, west, and northwest borders, expanding east beyond the East Cache Creek area and west to 82nd Street. On 1 March 1964, the north section of the H. E. Bailey Turnpike was completed, connecting Lawton directly to Oklahoma City, the capital. The south section of the turnpike leading to the Texas border was completed on April 23, 1964.

Urban-renewal efforts in the 1970s transformed downtown Lawton. A number of buildings dating to the city&#x27;s founding were demolished to build an enclosed shopping mall, which was believed to provide a suburban attraction for shoppers.

On June 23, 1998, the city expanded when Lawton annexed neighboring Fort Sill. The Base Realignment and Closure of 2005 resulted in reassignment of people from other bases and consolidation of some military activities at Fort Sill, increasing the number of people assigned there and its scope of activities. Lawton expects a continuing benefit of population and economic growth over the course of the next 20 years.

The team moved in 2007 from Oklahoma City to Lawton, where they won two Continental Basketball Association championships and a Premier Basketball League championship. In 2011, the Cavalry ceased operations in their second year in the PBL.

==Parks and recreation==
Lawton operates 80 parks and recreation areas in varying sizes, including the largest - Elmer Thomas Park.

The Lawton branch of the YMCA offers a wide variety of recreational programs to members, and the Lawton Country Club maintains an 18-hole, par 71 golf course. Recreation can also be found in many amateur leagues, including adult softball, youth baseball, soccer, softball, and volleyball.

==Government==

Lawton uses the council–manager model of municipal government. The city&#x27;s primary authority resides in the city council, which approves ordinances, resolutions, and contracts. The city is divided into eight wards, or single-member districts. Each ward elects a single city council representative for a three-year term. The mayor, who is elected at-large every three years, presides and sets the agenda of the City Council, but is primarily ceremonial as a head of government. The administrative day-to-day operation of the city is headed by the City Manager, who is appointed by the City Council. As of January 2024, the mayor of Lawton was Stan Booker. As of January 2022, the city manager was Michael Cleghorn.

Lawton is the county seat of Comanche County, and houses county offices and courts. Three elected commissioners serving four-year terms manage the county government.

At the federal level, Lawton lies in Oklahoma&#x27;s 4th congressional district, represented by Tom Cole. In the state senate, Lawton is in District 31 (Chris Kidd) and 32 (Dusty Deevers). In the House, District 62 (Daniel Pae), 63 (Trey Caldwell), and 64 (Rande Worthen) cover the city.

Founded in 2004, the college provides lower-division programs and educational opportunities in higher education for the Comanche Nation and the public.

Lawton is also served by the Great Plains Technology Center, which is part of the Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education system. Great Plains provides occupational education, training, and development opportunities to area residents.

===Primary and secondary schools===
Lawton Public Schools serve most of the city of Lawton. The district operates two prekindergarten centers, 24 elementary schools, four middle schools, and three high schools – Eisenhower, Lawton, and MacArthur. In 2008, Lawton Public Schools had an enrollment of about 16,000 students with about 1,000 teachers. Two independent districts, Bishop and Flower Mound, serve portions of Lawton. Bishop operates a single pre-K–6 elementary campus and Flower Mound has a pre-K–5 campus. Secondary students living in these districts attend Lawton Public Schools.

A small portion of far-west Lawton is served by Cache Public Schools. Some portions of the city limits are in Geronimo Public Schools.

Other schools in Lawton include Trinity Christian Academy, Lawton Academy of Arts &amp; Science, and Lawton Christian School. Trinity Christian Academy offers classes from K–3 through the eighth grade. Lawton Academy of Arts and Sciences and Lawton Christian has the city&#x27;s only two private independent high schools. Lawton Christian, founded in 1976, offers education from prekindergarten through the 12th grade, and has a student body of 426 students.

Lawton is part of a bistate media market that also includes the nearby, larger city of Wichita Falls, Texas; the market, which encompasses six counties in southwestern Oklahoma and 10 counties in western North Texas, has 152,950 households with at least one television set, making it the 148th-largest in the nation as of the 2016–2017 season, according to Nielsen Media Research.

<text>Medicine Park is a town in Comanche County, Oklahoma, United States, situated in the Wichita Mountains near the entrance to the Wichita Mountain Wildlife Refuge. Medicine Park has a long history as a vintage cobblestone resort town. Medicine Park is located near the city of Lawton and Fort Sill. It is an exurb, part of the Lawton Metropolitan Statistical Area. Many of the original structures are constructed of naturally formed cobblestones—these red granite cobblestones are unique to the Wichita Mountains. The population was 382 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
Medicine Park was founded on July 4, 1908, by Elmer Thomas, a young lawyer who had just become a member of the Oklahoma State Senate and would end his career in 1951 as a U.S. senator.

In the spring of 1906, five years after the establishment of the Wichita Mountains National Forest, Elmer Thomas envisioned the need not only for a recreational area but for a permanent water source for the newly founded nearby city of Lawton.

When the resort first opened, it consisted merely of a large surplus Army tent with a wooden floor where hot meals were served. Two dams were constructed on Medicine Creek to form Bath Lake Swimming Hole, and a limited number of campsites were constructed.

Tourists came to Medicine Park from around Oklahoma and North Texas. Soon, there were two inns—the Outside Inn and the Apache Inn.
Bob Wills and The Texas Playboys became regulars at the Dance Hall from 1929 through the late 1930s. Soon numerous other famous bands of the day made their way through Medicine Park en route to big city venues in Oklahoma City, Dallas, and Fort Worth.

The nearby Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge and Lake Lawtonka attracted thousands of people each weekend and throughout the seasons. Medicine Park became the “playground” for the state&#x27;s rich, famous and notorious. Outlaws and horse thieves mixed with noted politicians and businessmen, soldiers and officers from Fort Sill, families, and socialites in the new cobblestone community. The pages of the town&#x27;s colorful history are filled with such figures as Will Rogers, Wiley Post, Frank Phillips, Al Capone, Bonnie and Clyde, Pretty Boy Floyd, Lil Hardin Armstrong, Colonel Jack Abernathy, Les Brown, Roy Rogers, and Dale Evans.
An Oklahoma television station reported on June 13, 2018, that Expedia had named Medicine Park as &quot;... the fifth prettiest town in the U.S.&quot; The Lake Lawtonka Trails, including around Medicine Park, were rated by one mountain bike enthusiast site as the No. 1 best mountain bike trail area in Oklahoma, out of sixty-two contenders.

<text>Devol is a town in Cotton County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 93 at the 2020 census, an decrease of 38 percent from 150 at the 2000 census. The town is named for J. Fiske Devol, who owned the land on which it stands.

==History==
The community of Devol began in 1907, when the Wichita Falls and Northwestern Railway laid tracks through the area. A post office was established there on November 30, 1907. The railroad became a subsidiary of the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad (MK&amp;T or Katy) in 1911. By that year, the town had about 400 residents.

Discovery of the nearby Burkburnett Oil Field in 1918 initiated a brief boom in Devol. At least two refineries were built in the area, along with several oil pipelines. The 1920 census showed the population was 1,936. The town had the first dynamo in the area used for power in one of the two dance halls. Devol is said to have had four churches, a lumber store, feed store, a hotel, two dance halls/bars, a brothel and hundreds of small structures to rent as a home during the growing Burk boom. However, the boom ended in 1922, and most of the people related to that business moved away. The town bank failed in 1927. In 1930, the population of Devol was only 328. The 1940 census showed 208 residents.

Devol continued to shrink after World War II. Only 152 residents remained in 1950. The high school closed in 1953, and in 1957, all grades were consolidated along with those of Randlett and Union Valley to form the Big Pasture School District in Randlett. In 1959 a tornado damaged most of Devol&#x27;s business district (all three on the main street) and the old high school building. The town&#x27;s population reached 117, the lowest recorded in its history until the 2020 census. The MK&amp;T abandoned its tracks in 1972, and in the 1980s the only remaining business was a tack shop that specialized in making race horse saddles. It closed in the 1990s.

The only business in Devol proper is the Helena Chemical Company, formerly M&amp;E Soil Service, who employs two people. The post office had been threatened with closure in 1997 and 2002, and now operates limited weekly hours. However, a handful of casinos employ hundreds of employees southwest of the town near the Texas border

<text>Walters is a town in Cotton County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 2,412 as of the 2020 United States census. The city, nestled between twin creeks, is the county seat of Cotton County. The city&#x27;s motto is &quot;Small town; Big heart&quot;.

== History ==

The land that is present-day Oklahoma was first settled by prehistoric American Indians including the Clovis 11500 BCE, Folsom 10600 BCE and Plainview 10000 BCE cultures. Western explorers came to the region in the 16th century, with Spanish explorer Francisco Vásquez de Coronado visiting in 1541. Most of the region during this time was settled by the Wichita and Caddo peoples. Around the 1700s, two tribes from the North, the Comanches and Kiowas, migrated to the Oklahoma and Texas region.

For most of the 18th century, the Oklahoma region was under French control as part of Louisiana. In 1803, the Louisiana Purchase by Thomas Jefferson brought the area under United States control. In 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which removed American Indian tribes and relocated them to Indian Territory. The southern part of the territory was originally assigned to the Choctaw and Chickasaw, until the 1867 Medicine Lodge Treaty allotted the southwest portion of the Choctaw and Chickasaw&#x27;s lands to the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache.

The City of Walters was organized on August 6, 1901, under the original name of McKnight, Indian Territory. Application for a post office was made, and it was determined that a town in Harmon County had already taken the name of McKnight. This required that the name be changed. The name of Walters was chosen, in honor of W. R. Walters, but the &quot;s&quot; was not included on the post office application, so the post office was named Walter.

The city finally grew large enough to meet the requirements for a government patent, and one was granted in June 1904. On August 12, 1912, an election was held to form a new County (Cotton) from a portion of Comanche County.

<text>Ketchum is a town in Craig and Mayes counties, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 442 at the 2010 census, a 27 percent gain from 286 at the 2000 census.

==History==

Ketchum was named for a prominent member of the Delaware tribe and Methodist minister named James Ketchum who helped found the town in 1899. Ketchum was originally located in northeastern Mayes County, on the bank of the Grand River (Neosho River). It was relocated to southeastern Craig County around 1912 when the Kansas, Oklahoma, and Gulf Railroad (KO&amp;G) was being constructed from southeastern Kansas to Texas. The original townsite sat in an area that was later filled in by the creation of Grand Lake o&#x27; the Cherokees.

The economy of Ketchum was based on agriculture until Pensacola Dam was built in 1937-1939, creating Grand Lake. Since then, the local economy has largely been dominated by tourism and other businesses related to the lake.

Construction is currently underway to upgrade the town&#x27;s airport which was formerly known as the Craig County South Grand Lake Airport. A group of private investors is funding the new airport which includes paving the former grass runway. When the new airport is completed it will be a full service regional airport and will be named the South Grand Lake Regional Airport.

Vinita was founded in 1870 by Elias Cornelius Boudinot. In 1889, gunman and lawman Tom Threepersons was born there. It was the first city in the state with electricity. The city was first named &quot;Downingville&quot;, and was a primarily Native American community. It was later renamed &quot;Vinita&quot; after Boudinot&#x27;s friend, sculptor Vinnie Ream. The city was incorporated in Indian Territory in 1898.

Vinita is along the path of the Texas Road cattle trail, and the later Jefferson Highway of the early National Trail System, both roughly along the route of U.S. Route 69 through Oklahoma today.

The First National Bank opened in 1892, and the local Masonic Lodge was founded in 1894. Newspapers founded before the turn of the 20th Century included &quot;Vinita Indian Chieftain&quot; (1882), &quot;Vinita Leader&quot; (1885) and the &quot;Daily Indian Chieftain&quot; (1899). The &quot;Vinita Daily Journal&quot; began publication in 1907 and has continued into the 21st Century.

Eastern State Hospital, a state mental health facility, was constructed in 1912 and admitted the first patients in January 1913. It was one of the county&#x27;s largest employers until its operations were reduced during the 1990s.

The Will Rogers Archway, a service station over the top of Interstate 44, has a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant that was once the world&#x27;s largest by area, occupying . It was renovated in 2014 and is now smaller. Built in 1957, it is also the world&#x27;s first bridge restaurant.

==Economy==
Early in its history, cattle ranching in the surrounding countryside contributed heavily to Vinita&#x27;s economy. When Craig County was created at statehood, Vinita was designated as the county seat. City and county governments became significant employers. In 1935, the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA) was created. GRDA put its headquarters in Vinita. It is still one of the largest employers in the city, along with two of its many customers: Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma Electric Company (KAMO) and Northeast Oklahoma Electric Co-op. Other important employers have included trucking companies, tower-building companies, Munsingwear, General Mills, Cinch, Dana Industries, and Hope Industries.

In 2023, a company called American Heartland said it was planning a $2 billion, 1000-acre development containing a 125-acre Disneyland-type theme park. The land was six miles east of Vinita, but the town voted to annex the area in October, 2023. Ground was broken in early November, 2023 on the first phase of the project, being a 350-acre 750-slot RV park with 300 cabins.

Educational institutions were begun during Vinita&#x27;s earliest days. Worcester Academy opened in 1883. The Worcester Academy in Vinita should not be confused with the Worcester Academy that was founded in 1843 in Worcester, Massachusetts. The Massachusetts school is still in operation. It was followed by Willie Halsell College in 1888. Halsell College was originally established as Galloway College, named for Methodist Bishop Charles B. Galloway. The school was renamed in 1891 for Willie Halsell, the deceased daughter of a wealthy rancher, W. E. Halsell, who had rescued the school financially. However, the school again failed and closed permanently in 1908. The Roman Catholic Church operated Sacred Heart Academy, a boarding school, from 1897 until 1968.

<doc id="130142" wikidata="Q1942878" url="?curid=130142" title="Welch, Oklahoma">
<text>Welch is a town in northern Craig County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 619 at the 2010 census, an increase of 3.7 percent over the figure of 597 recorded in 2000. It is south of the Kansas state line, at the intersection of state highways 2 and 10 with U.S. Highway 59.

==History==
Welch was established in 1888 in the Cherokee Nation on land that D. B. Nigh leased from Frank Craig. The Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway (Katy) had built a line through the area in 1871, and in 1891 it built a switch on Nigh&#x27;s property, providing a shipping point for local hay and grain. The town that began to grow around the switch was named for a Katy railroad official, A. L. Welch. A post office was established in 1892. The town plat was approved in 1902, and the town incorporated in 1909.

===1999 kidnapping and murders===
On the night of December 29–30, 1999, firefighters responded to a fire reported at the home of Danny and Kathy Freeman in Welch. After extinguishing the blaze, they found the body of Kathy Freeman in one of the bedrooms, where she had been shot in the head, and also found that the fire had been deliberately set. Initially, they found no other bodies, but noticed that both Danny and their teen-age daughter, Ashley, were missing. The family car was in the driveway, with the keys in the ignition. The local police immediately assumed that the father had killed the mother and kidnapped Ashley.

When Lorene and Jay Bible woke on the morning of December 30, they discovered that their daughter, Lauria, had not come home after spending the previous day with Ashley Freeman, her best friend. They found Dan&#x27;s body in the rubble. He too, had been shot to death. Later that day, they learned that the two girls and Kathy Freeman had been seen earlier that day in the local pizza parlor, celebrating Ashley&#x27;s birthday. None of them had been seen since.

Sometime during the following decade, news media reported that two convicts, Tommy Lynn Sells and Jeremy Jones, had confessed to murdering the four victims. Their story did not check out, and they recanted their claims. ed murderer, Ronnie Busick, had bragged about killing the two girls. He and two alleged accomplices, Phil Welch and David Pennington claimed that the victims owed them money, and that they kept the girls alive for awhile hoping to get the money back. They further claimed that they tortured the girls before killing them and dumping the bodies in an Oklahoma mine shaft.

<text>Bristow is a city in Creek County, Oklahoma, United States. The population as of the 2020 Census was 4,248, up slightly from the population of 4,222 reported at the 2010 census.

==History==
Bristow began in 1898, when the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway (&quot;SL&amp;SF&quot;) built a track between Sapulpa and Oklahoma City. The town was named for Joseph L. Bristow, an Assistant U.S. Postmaster General who later served as a U.S. senator from Kansas. A post office was established April 25, 1898. By the 1900 census, the population was 626.

Bristow was designated as the county seat for Creek County at statehood when its population was 1,134. However, the county held a special election on August 20, 1908, to decide whether the seat would remain in Bristow or move to Sapulpa, which claimed to be more centrally located. Bristow had a larger population and claimed to have better railroad connections. Sapulpa won the election, but Bristow claimed voting irregularities. The election was voided and a new vote was held November 20, 1912. Again, Sapulpa won the election and the title of county seat.

The local economy depended heavily on cotton. Bristow had seven cotton gins and two cottonseed oil mills in the early 20th century. Other farms in the surrounding area produced corn, peanuts, potatoes and fruit. Oil and gas were discovered in the area around 1915. The discovery led to the construction of three refineries and four pipeline companies by 1930. The Oklahoma-Southwestern Railway built a short line from a connection with the SL&amp;SF at Bristow through the oilfields to Slick in 1920, but declining oilfield production and other factors lead to abandonment of that trackage in 1930. The peak census population was 6,619 in 1930.

==Geography==
Bristow is located in northern Oklahoma, just south of the geographic center of Creek County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.66%, is water.

==Economy==
From its inception, Bristow&#x27;s economy centered on agriculture, and specifically on growing and processing cotton. By the early 1900s, Bristow had seven cotton gins and two cotton-seed oil mills. Additionally, other farmers in the area produced corn, peanuts, Irish potatoes, and fruits.

Oil and natural gas were discovered nearby in 1914 - 1915, producing an economic boom lasting until 1923. The boom also caused a population spike. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, nearly 31,000 people lived within a few miles radius of Bristow in 1920.

Although the boom cooled by 1925, by 1930 the city was the site of three oil refineries, four pipeline facilities and offices for several petroleum-related companies. KFRU, one of Oklahoma&#x27;s first radio stations, started broadcasting from Bristow in January 1925.

<text>Kellyville is a town in Creek County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,019 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Kellyville was named for James E. Kelly , who established a local trading post in 1892 and opened a post office on November 27, 1893. The St. Louis and Oklahoma City Railroad-- later merged into the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway (&quot;Frisco&quot;)-- built a line through Kellyville in 1898.

Oklahoma&#x27;s worst train disaster took place just west of Kellyville on September 28, 1917, when two Frisco trains collided. Twenty-three people were killed and eighty injured. It remains one of the country&#x27;s bloodiest train wrecks due to the large number of cattle deaths. 

Oil and gas were discovered nearby in 1915. This created a population boom and attracted construction of a refinery in Kellyville. By 1930, the population was 548. Although oil and gas production waned, population continued to grow. Now, a significant number of employed residents commute to jobs in Sapulpa and Tulsa. However, Webco Industries has become a major local employer, having opened a corrosion-resistant alloy plant in Kellyville in 2008 which produces specialty nickel alloy and stainless tubing. The plant was significantly expanded in 2018.

In the early 1970s, there were plans to build a ski resort in Kellyville — Oklahoma&#x27;s first — using artificial snow, but the idea was short-lived due to the region&#x27;s climate.

<text>Kiefer is a town in Creek County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 2,187 at the 2020 census, a 30% increase over the 1,685 population recorded at the 2010 census, which itself was a 64 percent increase over the 1,026 figure recorded in 2000.

==History==
Kiefer was originally known as &quot;Praper&quot; when a post office was first established in 1901. The St. Louis, Oklahoma and Southern Railway (later the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway) constructed a line south from Sapulpa through Praper between 1900 and 1901. The route is today operated by BNSF. Praper became an oil boom town by 1906, when it grew into a major shipping point for crude from the Glenn Pool field. The post office was renamed &quot;Kiefer&quot; on December 12, 1906. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, the name honored at least one of three different people named Kiefer who lived in the area.

Kiefer voted to incorporate on November 20, 1908. The 1910 census reported a population of 1,197 inhabitants. This increased to 1,663 in 1920.

In the early days, Kiefer was on the route of the Sapulpa &amp; Interurban Railway (“S&amp;I”) streetcar/interurban line connecting to Tulsa through Sapulpa; S&amp;I subsequently went through a series of mergers and name changes, with only the Tulsa-to-Sapulpa portion continuing as the Tulsa-Sapulpa Union Railway.

The Kiefer Searchlight was a weekly newspaper published in Kiefer that included local, state, and national news along with advertising. 123 issues from 1908 to 1911 are available online.

In the 21st century, Kiefer is mostly a commuter town, with 94.6 percent of workers living in town commuting to jobs elsewhere, primarily in Tulsa. However, it is also headquarters for Bridge Crane Specialists, a company involved in the design, manufacturing, installation, and servicing of overhead and work station crane systems.

Kiefer is the site of an extensive residence known to locals as the Kiefer Castle, having been built to resemble a fairy-tale castle.

<text>Mounds is a town in Creek County, Oklahoma, United States. It is located just south of Tulsa; the town&#x27;s population was 932 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The post office for this community was established in 1895 and originally named &quot;Posey&quot;, for the Creek poet Alexander Posey, who lived in Eufaula, Oklahoma. In 1898, the town was moved southwest and renamed &quot;Mounds&quot; for twin hills that were nearby. By 1901, the St. Louis, Oklahoma and Southern Railway (later the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway) built a track through Mounds, and the town became an important cattle shipping point. Mounds incorporated as a city in the same year. The discovery of oil in the Glenn Pool field in 1905 turned Mounds into a shipping point for crude oil instead of cattle.

In the early days, Mounds was on the route of the Sapulpa &amp; Interurban Railway (“S&amp;I”) streetcar/interurban line connecting to Tulsa through Sapulpa, Kiefer and Glenpool; S&amp;I subsequently went through a series of mergers and name changes, with only the Tulsa-to-Sapulpa portion continuing as the Tulsa-Sapulpa Union Railway.

Mounds had a population of 675 at statehood in 1907, rising to 701 in 1910. The oil boom played out in the 1920s, and the population declined from 1,078 in 1920 to 701 in 1930. Railroad activity became primarily shipping grain and cattle. As time went by, the population reached a low of 560 in 1950, since which it has increased. In the 21st century, Mounds is mostly a commuter town, with 92 percent of employed residents commuting to work primarily in Sapulpa and Tulsa.

==Geography==
Mounds is located in eastern Creek County. U.S. Route 75A passes through the center of town, leading north to Kiefer and south to Beggs. Sapulpa, the Creek County seat, is north via U.S. 75A. U.S. Route 75 is east of Mounds via West 201st Street; downtown Tulsa is north of Mounds via U.S. 75.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Mounds has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.20%, is water.

The average household size was 2.57 and the average family size was 3.10.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 29.3% under the age of 18, 9.1% from 18 to 24, 25.0% from 25 to 44, 22.4% from 45 to 64, and 14.2% who were 65 years of age or older.

Mounds is the site of the ACT Observatory, a small astronomical observatory maintained by the Astronomy Club of Tulsa.

==&quot;Liberty Mounds&quot;==
There is no town of Liberty Mounds, despite the signs on US Route 75 pointing to Mounds on the west of the highway, and “Liberty Mounds” east of it. The town of Liberty, Oklahoma was originally incorporated in 1978 by the Spradling family precisely to avoid annexation of the area by other communities, including Mounds. The name was taken from the nearby Liberty School District, which a former school superintendent called “Liberty Mounds” to distinguish it from another Liberty school district near Morris in Okmulgee County. So the sign references the school, although both the town and the school district are actually named Liberty.

==Notable people==
* Thomas Gilcrease (1890-1962), Oklahoma oilman, philanthropist, founder of Gilcrease Museum in Tulsa lived in Mounds during boyhood
* George E. R. Kinnear II (1928–2015), four star admiral in the United States Navy
* Reuben Wilson (born 1935), jazz organist

<doc id="130150" wikidata="Q3240318" url="?curid=130150" title="Sapulpa, Oklahoma">
<text>Sapulpa is a city in Creek and Tulsa counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The population was 21,929 at the time of the 2020 census, compared with 20,544 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Creek County.

==History==
===Early history===
The town was named after the area&#x27;s first permanent settler, a full-blood Lower Creek Indian named James Sapulpa, from the Kasihta or Cusseta band, from Osocheetown in Alabama. About 1850, he established a trading post near the meeting of Polecat and Rock creeks (about one mile (1.6 km) southeast of downtown Sapulpa).

When the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad (which became the Frisco) built a spur to this area in 1886, it was known as Sapulpa Station. The Sapulpa post office was chartered July 1, 1889 and the town was incorporated March 31, 1898.

===Controversy over Creek County seat location===
After Oklahoma became a state, each county held an election to determine the location of the county seat. Sapulpa competed with Bristow to be the county seat of Creek County. After five years of contested elections and court suits, the issue was settled by the Oklahoma Supreme Court on August 1, 1913. Sapulpa was ruled the winner. The county courthouse was completed in 1914, replacing an earlier structure built in 1902.

===Economic development===
When Sapulpa was founded, the main crop of the area was walnuts. In 1898, the Sapulpa Pressed Brick was established, followed in a few years by the Sapulpa Brick Company. This began the clay products industry. Sapulpa is the former home of Frankoma Pottery, which is now located south of Glenpool.

The founding of Premium Glass Company in 1912 marked Sapulpa&#x27;s entry to glass manufacturing. Premium Glass was acquired by Liberty Glass Company in 1918. The plant, after many changes to the facilities and in ownership, makes beer bottles under the Ardagh Group.

Other glass factories in the city included the Bartlett-Collins Glass Company, originally opened in 1914, which was closed by subsequent owner Anchor Hocking in 2008. The Schram Glass Company, which opened a jar and jar cap plant in 1914, was closed by the Ball Brothers in 1931. The Sunflower Glass Plant, which produced window glass, began operations in 1913 and, after being leased to Victory Window Glass Co. in 1924, ceased operations in 1932.

According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History&quot;, Sapulpa was known as &quot;The Crystal City of the Southwest&quot;.

===Rail transportation===

In 1886 the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, which already had a line stretching from Missouri to Tulsa and Red Fork, extended its tracks into Sapulpa. In 1898, the St. Louis and Oklahoma City Railroad built 103.2 miles of track from Sapulpa to Oklahoma City. Both of these lines subsequently came under the control of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway (&quot;Frisco&quot;). The Frisco built a railyard in Sapulpa and by 1900 designated Sapulpa as an overhaul base for its rolling stock. Also in 1900, construction of the line from Sapulpa to Denison, Texas was started and rushed to completion by March 1901. With changes in ownership over the years, the portion of the old Frisco line between Sapulpa and Del City, Oklahoma, near Oklahoma City, known as the Sooner Sub, ended up being owned by the State of Oklahoma.

In 1998, the Sooner Sub was leased to Stillwater Central Railroad, and in 2014 was sold to them. The sale contract required initiating a six-month trial of daily passenger service before August 2019—known as the Eastern Flyer—with a financial penalty of $2.8 million for failure to meet the deadline.

On August 5, 2019, with no passenger service in place, the Stillwater Central defaulted on the contract and paid the penalty.

Sapulpa in its early days was on the route of the Sapulpa &amp; Interurban Railway (&quot;S&amp;I&quot;) streetcar/interurban line connecting to Tulsa in one direction, and Kiefer, Glenpool, and Mounds in the other. S&amp;I subsequently underwent a series of mergers and name changes, with only the Tulsa-to-Sapulpa portion continuing as the Tulsa-Sapulpa Union Railway.

===Route 66===
Sapulpa is on old U.S. Route 66, now SH-66 and Historic Route 66 (a/k/a the West Ozark Trail) through town. Route 66 sites include the Heart of Route 66 Auto Museum, which opened in August 2016 in an armory built in 1948, and the Tee Pee Drive-In which opened the next year. It features the world&#x27;s tallest replica antique visible gas pump, at 66 feet, or 74 feet including the circular sign on top. Still standing is the Rock Creek Bridge, a/k/a the historic Bridge #18 at Rock Creek, a 1921 metal bridge that became a link in the original Route 66 in 1926.

==Geography==
Sapulpa is located in the northeast corner of Creek County. A small portion of the city that extends north into Tulsa County was annexed into Sapulpa in 2004. Downtown Tulsa is to the northeast via Interstate 44. The Creek Turnpike (State Highway 364) branches east from I-44 in northeastern Sapulpa and provides a southern and eastern bypass of Tulsa.

In January 2018, the Sapulpa City Council voted to approve the annexation of approximately 300 acres of land in West Tulsa. The land is bordered to the north by 51st Street, to the south by Southwest Blvd, and to the west by 65th West Avenue. Originally, this annexation included the future site of the interchange of the Gilcrease Expressway and I-44. However, the city has now planned to de-annex this area back to the city of Tulsa.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Sapulpa has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.21%, is water.

<text>Shamrock () is an unincorporated town in Creek County, Oklahoma, United States, located on Oklahoma State Highway 16 south of Drumright and west-northwest of Bristow. The population was 65 at the time of the 2020 census. It was named for Shamrock, Illinois (just southeast of Bloomington), the hometown of local store owner, James M. Thomas.

==History==
In 1908, James M. Thomas, a native of Shamrock, Illinois, moved to this area and opened a store. He named the post office that he established on July 9, 1910, in honor of his home town. Between 1915 and 1916, the Sapulpa and Oil Field Railroad (later the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway) built a line northward from Depew to Shamrock. The railroad bypassed the town by three-fourths of a mile, so the citizens moved their businesses closer to the railroad. In 1916, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway constructed a line that connected Shamrock and Drumright. These lines developed Shamrock as a major shipping point for oil field equipment and crude oil. The town adopted an Irish theme, with streets named Tipperary, Dublin, Killarney, Blarney, and Cork.

Shamrock became quite the oil and gas boomtown when the nearby Cushing Oil Field began to develop. Numerous oilfield camps began to spring up in the vicinity, and Shamrock developed a reputation as a bawdy town with saloons, gambling halls, and brothels. Colorful stories abound. Two noted oilmen, Tom Slick and Harry Sinclair, had a few drinks one night and were racing horse teams up and down Shamrock&#x27;s main street. The Big Six gambling hall had a one-legged fiddle player who was known to take off his wooden leg and use it as a club to keep order in the place. However, the oil boom and its workers started moving to new areas in the mid-1920s, and Shamrock began to shrink. Still, the town was exciting enough in 1932 to have its bank robbed by Pretty Boy Floyd.

Shamrock at one point had two weekly newspapers. One was The Shamrock Brogue. The editorial in the first issue dated January 1, 1916, summarized the paper&#x27;s view and intent: “Shamrock is on the map to stay and the Brogue is here to boost for the town. The Brogue will never knock. The mission of a newspaper is to boost for its own home town first, last and all the time, and that is the program that the Brogue will follow.” The other paper was the Shamrock Blarney, first printed on March 9, 1916. Both papers were succeeded by the Creek County Democrat, which published to at least January 23, 1930.

The board of trustees voted to dissolve the town in June 2010.

<text>Cleora is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Delaware County, Oklahoma, United States, along State Highway 85. The population was 1,463 at the 2010 census, up from the figure of 1,113 recorded in 2000. The Cleora Post Office existed from November 28, 1900, until October 15, 1954. Cleora was established in District 2 of the old Indian Territory. It was named for Cleora Ann Lunday, sister of the postmaster, Ed Lunday.

==History==
Few dates are available to detail how the community developed. Settlement began &quot;circa&quot; 1890, before Oklahoma became a state, and was part of the Cherokee Nation of Indian Territory. The main occupation was farming. The rich soil produced wheat, corn and oats. However, the unnamed community was far from any larger settlements. The local residents had to travel to either Afton or Vinita to either shop or get their mail. Local resident, Ed Lunday, soon built a general store, and was then persuaded by the other residents to apply for a post office. He needed to name the post office before submitting his application, and decided to name it for one of his six sisters. The Cleora post office was established in Lunday&#x27;s store on November 28, 1900. A school, two churches (Methodist and Christian) and some houses had been built before 1904, when a tornado destroyed the Christian church.

The Kansas, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway (KO&amp;G) built its main line through Cleora in 1910, apparently bringing prosperity in its wake. Sunday&#x27;s general store moved into a larger building and Bob Aldrich opened a hardware store. Other businesses were a two-story hotel, lumber company, grain elevator and livery stable.

In 1928, residents decided to consolidate the three small school districts of Old Cleota, New Cleota and Walnut Hill.

When planning began for the Pensacola Dam and the Grand Lake o&#x27; the Cherokees, it was learned that much of the older sites would be inundated by the project. Although some residents moved to higher ground, many others simply moved away.

==Geography==
Cleora is located in northwestern Delaware County on the northwest side of the Grand Lake o&#x27; the Cherokees. It is southwest of Bernice, south of Afton, and southeast of Vinita.

<doc id="130164" wikidata="Q570979" url="?curid=130164" title="Colcord, Oklahoma">
<text>Colcord is a town in southern Delaware County, Oklahoma, United States. The community lies in the northeastern part of the state in a region known as Green Country. The population was 815 at the 2010 census, a decline of 0.5 percent from the figure of 819 recorded in 2000.

== History ==
Colcord&#x27;s history starts decades before the establishment of the town itself, with the community of Row, Indian Territory, in the 1890s. As settlers moved to the area, the town of Row grew and businesses formed, including a bank, a school, a hotel, and others. A Post Office was established on May 20, 1905.

In the 1920s, a road (later known as Oklahoma State Highway 116) was built that passed south of the then-healthy town of Row. A rural mail carrier, Charles Burbage, who owned land to the south where the new road was established, platted into blocks, lots and streets. The area grew into a community known as &quot;Little Tulsa&quot; to locals, until residents changed the name in September 1928 to &quot;Colcord,&quot; after Charles Francis Colcord. Mr. Colcord was a successful and prominent cattle rancher, oil businessman, and early Oklahoma Territory lawman from Oklahoma City, who owned a large ranch west of the two towns. The ranch employed many local residents, and was very important to the economy and spirit of the area.
Due to better transportation and a disastrous fire that wiped out many buildings in Row, most businesses moved to Colcord, and the new town was approved to build a high school. A feud between the two towns ensued, and in the first eleven years of Colcord&#x27;s existence, the school was involved in eleven lawsuits.

The community hosts &quot;Old Settlers Day&quot; celebration and parade on the second Saturday of June each year to honor its heritage and the many people that settled in the area and established the town.
== New Life Ranch Flint Valley ==

New Life Ranch Flint Valley (NLR) is a nearby Christian camp that functions as a summer camp for kids in grades 3-12 and a retreat center throughout the rest of the year. Children and teenagers from all over the United States attend the camp, participating in one-week resident sessions from June through August. In 2016, approximately 30,000 people attended camps and retreats hosted at NLR. Summer camp activities are primarily outdoor, including archery, biking, canoeing, rappelling, horseback riding, riflery, ropes courses, swimming, and tennis. As of August 2018, the owners of NLR also run New Life Ranch Frontier Cove, a similar camp in Adair, Oklahoma.
== Natural Falls State Park ==
Nearby is Natural Falls State Park, off Hwy 412 W at West Siloam Springs, one of the most beautiful scenic wonders in the state of Oklahoma. The natural setting and scenic beauty of the waterfall is known to millions of movie lovers. The popular 1974 film Where the Red Fern Grows was filmed in part at Natural Falls (then called Dripping Springs). The movie tells the story of a young boy growing up in rural Oklahoma during the hard times of the Great Depression and is considered an American classic.

<text>Grove is a city in Delaware County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 6,623 at the 2010 census, an increase of 27.6 percent over the figure of 5,131 recorded in 2000. Grove is surrounded by Grand Lake o’ the Cherokees, a professional bass fishing tournament lake and recreational hotspot during the travel season of Memorial Day to Labor Day.

==History==
Prior to Oklahoma statehood, Grove was part of the Delaware District of the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory. It was named for a grove of trees where it was sited. A post office, named &quot;Brennen&quot;, was located in the limits of present-day Grove in 1888, but the city was not incorporated until the 1890s.

Grove was aided in 1900 by connection to the Arkansas and Oklahoma Railroad (later acquired by the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway). Grove was the only incorporated town in Delaware County by the time of Oklahoma statehood in 1907, and became the county seat. However, Grove&#x27;s location near the northern border of the county, and not near the county center, made it inconvenient for some county residents to visit, and after a county-wide vote in 1908, Jay was redesignated as the county seat. Grove eventually lost its railroad connection in 1940.

In recent years, the city underwent a $3.7 million park project to attract fishing events to Grand Lake, most recently attracting the 2013 and 2016 Bassmaster Classic. Grove is also home to the Grand Lake Casino, which was opened in 1988.

<text>Jay is a city and county seat of Delaware County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 2,448 at the 2010 census, compared to 2,482 at the 2000 census, a decrease of 1.4 percent. Almost 40% of its residents are Native American, thus Jay is home to numerous Cherokee tribal offices and a health clinic for the Delaware District of the Cherokee Nation. Jay has a council-manager system of government. Becki Farley is the mayor with Kyle Stump serving as Vice Mayor.

The city is celebrated as the Huckleberry Capital of the World and has been host to the annual Huckleberry Festival each July 4 weekend since 1967.

==History==
Jay was named for Jay Washbourne, a nephew of Stand Watie and grandson of an early-day Cherokee missionary. The town is the county seat of Delaware County, having won that distinction from Grove, Oklahoma in a special county seat election on December 8, 1908. The 1910–11 Legislature made Grove a County Court Town, and provided for two court terms each year. On June 27, 1911, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma ruled in favor of Jay, and on January 5, 1912, the County Commissioners ordered the records to be moved to Jay. On May 10, 1913, the courthouse in Jay was burned, destroying most of the county records. The post office was established May 19, 1909. Jay incorporated in 1939.

==Geography==

Jay is located in the oak and hickory forests of the Ozark Plateau. 

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The Cherokee name for Jay is Dlaygvi (Bluejay Place).

Jay is at the intersection of U.S. Route 59 and Oklahoma State Highway 20, southeast of Grand Lake of the Cherokees and northeast of Lake Eucha.

Jay is atypical in Oklahoma history because the townsite and layout were located and platted specifically for its purpose as a county seat. It is not located on a river, major road or railway line as were most Oklahoma towns of the late 1800s and early 1900s. 

Around 1908, the Delaware County Improvement Association hired a survey team to pinpoint the exact location of the center of the county. They pinpointed allotment land belonging to Thomas Oochaleta, a full-blood Cherokee. Since acquiring title to a full-blood&#x27;s allotment would require a lengthy federal legal procedure, the committee shifted their attention to the allotment adjoining Oochaleta&#x27;s on the east, a parcel belonging to committee member Claude L. &quot;Jay&quot; Washbourne. As a mixed-blood Cherokee, Washbourne was exempt from the federal policy restricting the sale or transfer of his land. He gave ten acres on which to construct a town. The town was designed, reserving a central block for a courthouse. The committee quickly constructed a frame building and then applied to the U.S. Postal Service for a post office, submitting the required three town names for consideration. The names submitted were &quot;Center,&quot; &quot;Jay,&quot; and &quot;Washbourne.&quot; Postal authorities chose Jay for its brevity.
