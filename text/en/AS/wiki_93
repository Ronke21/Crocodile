<doc id="136115" wikidata="Q2296863" url="?curid=136115" title="Tetraneutron">
<text>The tetraneutron is considered an unbound isotope with a lifetime around 10−22 seconds. The stability of this cluster of four neutrons is not supported by current models of nuclear forces. Recent empirical evidence is &quot;consistent with a quasi-bound tetraneutron state existing for a very short time&quot;.

== Marqués&#x27; experiment ==
Francisco-Miguel Marqués and co-workers at the GANIL accelerator in Caen used a particle accelerator to fire atomic nuclei at carbon targets and observed the &quot;spray&quot; of particles from the resulting collisions. In this case the experiment involved firing beryllium-14, boron-15 and lithium-11 nuclei at a small carbon target, the most successful being beryllium-14. This isotope of beryllium has a nuclear halo that consists of four clustered neutrons; this allows it to be easily separated intact in the high-speed collision with the carbon target. Current nuclear models suggest that four separate neutrons should result when beryllium-10 is produced, but the single signal detected in the production of beryllium-10 suggested a multineutron cluster in the breakup products; most likely a beryllium-10 nucleus and four neutrons fused together into a tetraneutron.

A later analysis of the method used in the Marqués&#x27; experiment suggested that the detection mechanism was unlikely but the suggestion was refuted, and attempts to reproduce these observations with different methods have not successfully detected any neutron clusters.

== Consequences of hypothetical bound tetraneutrons==
If, however, the existence of bound tetraneutrons were ever independently confirmed, considerable adjustments would have to be made to current nuclear models. Bertulani and Zelevinsky proposed that, if it existed, the tetraneutron could be formed by a bound state of two dineutron systems. However, attempts to model interactions that might give rise to multineutron clusters have failed, and it &quot;does not seem possible to change modern nuclear Hamiltonians to bind a tetraneutron without destroying many other successful predictions of those Hamiltonians. This means that, should a recent experimental claim of a bound tetraneutron be confirmed, our understanding of nuclear forces will have to be significantly changed.&quot; 
Further work in 2019 suggests potentially observable consequences in neutron star crusts, if the tetraneutron exists.

== Evidence for very short lived resonances ==

In 2016, researchers at RIKEN in Wakō, Japan observed evidence that the tetraneutron exists briefly as a resonance. They fired a beam of neutron-rich helium-8 nuclei (two protons and six neutrons) at a liquid target composed of helium-4 (two protons and two neutrons). Occasionally, the reaction produced beryllium-8 nuclei with four protons and four neutrons, leaving four neutrons unaccounted for. If a four-neutron nucleus did occur, it lasted for about 10−21 seconds before decaying into other particles.

Evidence for unbound clusters of 4 neutrons resonances in the disintegration of beryllium-14 nuclei, in 8He-8Be interactions, and collisions of 4He nuclei give an estimated lifetime around 10−22 seconds.
These discoveries should deepen our understanding of the nuclear forces.

<text>Newbie is a slang term for a , , or somebody inexperienced in a given profession or activity. In particular, it may refer to a new user of computers, and often concerns Internet activity, such as online gaming or Linux use.

The origin of this term is uncertain. Earliest uses probably date to late twentieth century United States Armed Forces jargon, though possible precursor terms date much earlier. The related term noob (often stylized as &quot;n00b&quot;) is frequently used in online gaming.

==History==
The etymology of the term is uncertain. It may derive from &quot;newie&quot;, which is attested in U.S. and Australian sources of the 1850s, meaning a neophyte in a place or situation; alternatively, it may derive from the British public school slang &quot;new boy&quot; or &quot;new blood&quot;, which is attributed to the same era and was applied to a schoolboy in his first term.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the term &quot;newbie&quot; had a limited usage among U.S. troops in the Vietnam War as a slang term for a new man in a unit.

Another use of the term newbee was the moniker given to new U.S. Navy recruit students attending Basic Electricity and Electronics school by more senior students, a requisite course prior to enrollment in the A-school course at Naval Air Technical Training Center, Millington, Tennessee.

The earliest appearance of the term on the Internet may have been on the Usenet newsgroup &quot;talk.bizarre&quot;. By 1988, it had already entered online usage.

Coming from an oral tradition, the term has various spellings. Among alternative forms are &quot;newby&quot;, &quot;nubie&quot;, and &quot;newbee&quot; (e.g. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; of August 1985: &quot;It had to do with newbees. I could be wrong on the spelling, but newbies are the rookies among the Blue Angels.&quot;).

In 2000, Electronic Arts released The Sims. The game featured a tutorial house with a family called The Newbies.

==Connotations of variants==
Different spellings can have quite different connotations; so in some contexts a &quot;newb&quot; refers to a beginner who is willing to learn, while a &quot;noob&quot; refers disparagingly to an inexperienced or under-talented hacker or gamer who lacks the determination to learn.

The origin of &quot;nub&quot; means &quot;non-usable body&quot; in the context of military submarines. It referred to crew that were too new to contribute, while wasting precious oxygen.

==Similar terms in other languages==
* In Korean, the equivalent term is chobo or hasu, the opposite of &quot;gosu&quot;, meaning &quot;highly skilled&quot;.
* In Chinese, cainiao (). It either originated from Hong Kong or from the Taiwanese army. It became an Internet slang term used in the Chinese-speaking community.

<text>Emu oil is an oil derived from body fat harvested from certain subspecies of the emu, &quot;Dromaius novaehollandiae&quot;, a flightless bird indigenous to Australia.

Unadulterated emu oil can vary widely in colour and viscosity anywhere from an off-white creamy texture to a thin yellow liquid, depending on the diet of the emu and the refining method(s) used. Industrially refined emu oil is composed of a minimum of 70% unsaturated fatty acids. The largest component is oleic acid, a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid. Emu oil also contains roughly 20% linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and 1–2% linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid). Fully refined emu oil has a bland flavour.

Emu oil has previously been wrongly promoted as a dietary supplement with the claim it can treat a variety of human ailments, including cancer and arthritis.

==Research==
Since 2015 two small human studies have been done, one for use as a skin moisturizer and the other for use as an insect repellent.

Commercial emu oil supplements are not standardised and vary widely in their potency. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration highlighted emu oils in a 2009 article on &quot;How to Spot Health Fraud&quot;, pointing out that many &quot;pure emu oil&quot; products are unapproved drugs.

==History==
From the &quot;Handbook of Texas Online&quot;:

&quot;Settlers, attracted to the site because it was the nearest point to Hillsboro where timber could be found, began moving into the area in the 1840s. The original settlement, near the site of present Aquilla, was called Mudtown. The community of Aquilla and nearby Aquilla Creek were probably named for early settler Aquilla Jones. The town received a post office in 1859. Twenty years later the tracks of the Texas Central Railroad crossed southwestern Hill County, passing within a few miles of the timber settlement. Shortly thereafter, businesses and residents moved a few miles south to the rail line. The community&#x27;s population was 175 in 1886 and 100 in 1892. A series of illnesses resulted from drinking creek water, so a well was dug in 1897 to provide fresh water. One of the state&#x27;s first chartered banks opened at Aquilla in 1905, when the town also had a health spa. In 1910 the population surpassed 200. By 1914 it had a population of over 500 and thirteen retail stores, three hotels, four churches, a school, a newspaper, a bank, and a thriving lumber company. By the late 1950s there were 250 residents and ten businesses in Aquilla. In 2000 there were thirteen businesses and 136 residents.&quot;

<text>Hillsboro is a city in and the county seat of Hill County, Texas, United States. It is located between Dallas, Fort Worth and Waco, directly on Interstate 35 in North Central Texas. Hillsboro draws trade from throughout the county, and from Interstate 35 travelers between Dallas, Fort Worth, and Waco. 

Hillsboro is the gateway to Lake Whitney, Lake Whitney State Park, and nearby Lake Aquilla - all within a 15 minute drive from Hillsboro, Texas.

==History==

In 1853, the Texas Legislature carved Hill County out of Navarro County. Named for physician and Republic of Texas Secretary of War Dr. George Washington Hill, the new county had only recently attracted Anglo settlement, following the establishment in 1848 of Fort Graham. County commissioners selected Hillsboro, originally spelled Hillsborough, as county seat. They established the town on land donated by Thomas Steiner, John Caruthers and Jonathan Newby, and the community soon had a school and post office, as well as a wood-frame courthouse. Cotton became the mainstay of Hillsboro’s late 19th-century economy. The city experienced rapid growth after the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railroad and other lines came to the town in the early 1880s. In addition to bringing new settlers and giving access to shipping and transportation, railroads provided many new jobs. The city continued to grow and incorporated in 1881. The cotton industry produced a building boom between 1890 and 1910, as evidenced by the numerous Queen Anne homes still intact today, as well as the noted 1890 Hill County Courthouse. In 1923, the community established the Hillsboro Junior College, which over the years has become Hill College.

<text>Whitney is a city in Hill County, Texas, United States. Its population was 1,992 at the 2020 census.
The city is east of Lake Whitney.
== History ==
Whitney was established in 1876 when the Houston and Texas Central Railroad (H&amp;TC) built a line through Hill County to Cleburne. The town&#x27;s namesake comes from Charles A. Whitney, principle stock holder of H&amp;TC, and son-in-law of Charles Morgan.

=== Battle of the Benches ===
In 1922, D. (&quot;Doctor Dee&quot;) Scarborough, the druggist of Whitney installed a bench outside of his store. Within a short period of time, the bench became home to the local old men seeking refuge from the sun and women; comfortably installed on its well-worn planks, they whittled, spat tobacco juice on the sidewalks, studied the weather and damned the modern world with lordliness and venom.

In the following years after World War II, Whitney began to modernize. The town&#x27;s housewives absorbed the spirit of change and called on the young Mayor Fred Basham to remove the bench, complaining about the spitting and language of the old men. The mayor complied and had the chief of police move the bench into an alley nearby. Upon the discovery their sanctuary was ignominiously lugged into a nearby alley, the old men of the town angrily threw a petition to asking for the bench to be placed back.

When the town ignored the old men, they dragged nail kegs to the spot where the bench had originally reposed. The chief of police threatened to confiscate the nail kegs. That was more than the old men could take. They demanded, and finally received a special municipal election to decide whether the bench should be restored.

On July 30, 1949, the women and mayor were defeated by a vote of 124 to 67 in favor of returning the bench.

<text>Anton ( ) is a city in Hockley County, Texas, United States. The population was 907 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Anton was founded in 1924 near the center of the north pasture of the former Spade Ranch when ranch owner William Leonard Ellwood contracted with the Anton Townsite Company to plat a town at the site of Danforth Switch, a spur of the Pecos and Northern Texas Railway. The town was named in honor of J.F. Anton, a Santa Fe railroad executive.

Anton&#x27;s first mayor was Paul Grover Whitfield, who was born in July 1908, so in 1924 was only 16 or 17 years old. He told everyone he was 18, so was able to accept the position. He is, therefore, on record as being the youngest mayor ever in Texas at the time, and since he was under 18, the record stands to this day and likely will for all time. Whether an election was held or if he simply volunteered for the position is unclear. In those days, identification was not required because most agreements were done with a handshake.

==Geography==
Anton sits just to the east of the geographic center of the level High Plains of the Llano Estacado. The flat terrain is broken to the west by a dry watercourse called Yellow House Draw, which passes about to the southwest of Anton.

==UFO allegations==
Levelland is famous as the site of a well-publicized series of UFO sightings in November 1957. Several motorists driving on various highways around Levelland in the evening and early morning hours of November 2–3 claimed to see a large, egg-shaped object which emitted a blue glow and caused their automobiles to shut off. In most cases, the object was sitting either on the highway or close to it. When the object took off, witnesses claimed their vehicles would restart and work normally. Among witnesses were Weir Clem, Levelland&#x27;s sheriff, and Ray Jones, the town&#x27;s fire chief. The United States Air Force concluded a severe electrical storm (most probably ball lightning), was the major cause for the sightings and reported auto failures. However, several prominent UFO researchers, among them Dr. James E. McDonald, a physicist at the University of Arizona, and Dr. J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer at Northwestern University, disputed this explanation. Both men argued that no electrical storm was in the area when the sightings occurred.

<text>Smyer is a town in Hockley County, Texas, United States. It is located near the Old Spade Ranch House where the current ranch headquarters is. The population was 441 at the 2020 census. in 2023, the population declined to 433.

== History ==
Smyer was settled in 1917, when William L. Ellwood began selling portions of the Spade Ranch to farmers. The town was founded in 1924 and deemed platted in 1925 after construction was completed, which soon opened up the rail service to begin in Smyer when the Santa Fe ran railroad beside the townsite. The town had many things to offer as a small town such as a school, a gin, two stores, a railway depot, and a lumberyard. The school district was created in 1924 and organized in 1927 as the old school board and new board consolidated to form the present-day school board. In 1929, the town was hit by a heavy tornado and it destroyed many things in Smyer, but the farmers managed to get back up and rebuilt from the ground up and made it better. In 1951, a new elementary school was built and in 1957, newer additions of the buildings were made to improve the student&#x27;s time in school. In 1963, Smyer decided that with new plans for a school building, they would create and established a government body in the town and soon enough incorporated the same year. In 1980, the population was 455, and in 2000, the population was 480, the largest peak population ever in Smyer. In 2020, Smyer remodeled, rebuilt, and sold different areas and certain criteria around the town&#x27;s functions. The town is predicted to grow in the coming years as western Lubbock continues to grow and impact other areas such as Ropesville.

== Smyer Santa Fe Depot ==
In 1925, a brick depot was constructed be the Santa Fe to serve as a midway between the towns of Levelland and Lubbock. Clinton E. Smyer, a railroad superintendent, wanted a town of his own since other people from the railway company were able to get approval for their own railroad towns. The town was given a depot to serve its area and ship the farmers’ crops and other supplies to Lubbock to be hauled onto mainlines in the other parts of Texas. The depot was an updated version from the 1895 variant to the newer style common for the time. The depot served Smyer as the South Plains &amp; Santa Fe Railroad and made large vast trips to father areas across the South Plains. When the SP&amp;SF eventually consolidated and ceased in the later years, the depot in Smyer was of no use until it was converted into a residence and was updated into its current status. The depot is alongside the road to the new gas station in Smyer, and has a red brick look to it with some modifications such as modern woodwork and other things. The depot is currently still in use as a residential property.

<text>Granbury is a city in and the county seat of Hood County, Texas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 10,958, and it is the principal city of the Granbury micropolitan statistical area. Granbury is named after Confederate General Hiram B. Granbury.

== History ==
Granbury started as a square and log cabin courthouse. Many buildings on the square are now registered historic landmarks, including the Granbury Opera House, which still hosts &quot;Broadway&quot; productions. The city&#x27;s name originated from Confederate General Hiram B. Granberry. To explain why the city name is spelled differently, some scholars believe the name Granberry was misread on a document. Recent findings conclude that Granberry chose to spell his name Granbury.

The Fort Worth and Rio Grande Railway, building towards Brownwood from Fort Worth, reached Granbury in 1887. In the 20th century, the line was owned successively by the Frisco Railway, the Santa Fe Railway, and the South Orient Railroad before being acquired by the Fort Worth and Western Railroad in 1999.

A recent expansion of the city was made possible by building a Brazos River dam in 1969, which formed Lake Granbury, a long, narrow lake that flows through the city.

On May 15, 2013, a tornado with a preliminary rating of EF4 struck Granbury, leaving six confirmed deaths and at least 100 homes damaged. Approximately 48 injured people were treated at Lake Granbury Medical Center. The tornado was a part of the Tornado outbreak of May 15–17, 2013 in Texas and Oklahoma.

In July 2024, &quot;Time&quot; magazine published an investigation into numerous noise and health complaints by Granbury residents, many of whom attributed their ailments to a Bitcoin mining facility located in Granbury owned by Marathon Digital Holdings.

<text>Sulphur Springs is a city in and the county seat of Hopkins County, Texas, United States. As of the 2020 census, its population was 15,941. Sulphur Springs is located in Northeast Texas.

==History==

Sulphur Springs [&quot;sic&quot;] was named so because when the area was first settled, springs of sulfurous water were abundant.

Eli Bib, one of the first European-American settlers, ran a store from his cabin, selling staples, whiskey, persimmon beer, and slabs of ginger cake. In 1849, Dr. and Mrs. Davis moved into the area. Dr. Davis envisioned the spot as a future city. In 1850, the residents organized the area’s first church, the Methodist Episcopal. Construction of the church was completed in 1853. In 1852, the Presbyterian Church was organized. At that time, the population of the village was 441. To serve the growing population, commodities began to be brought in from nearby Jefferson. New stores were established.

The village became a city in 1854 when the first post office was established. The city’s name was originally “Bright Star”. Mail to and from the city was delivered by the Pony Express. On May 18, 1871, the legislature moved the county seat of Hopkins County from Tarrant to Sulphur Springs, and the name “Bright Star” was removed from the postal directory.
Local government organized slowly. The first known mayor was William A. Wortham. In 1854, Wortham had bought the ‘’Texas Star’’ press and moved to Sulphur Springs. His brother-in-law, Bill Davis, and he established the city’s first newspaper.


The county seat had numerous newspapers. Echo Publishing Company was founded in 1897. It was the first steam-powered press in Sulphur Springs. After the first plant was lost to a fire, a new plant was constructed that used gasoline as fuel. In 1884, the ‘’Sulphur Springs Enterprise’’ was founded. In the same year, James Harvey &quot;Cyclone&quot; Davis, a Populist (People&#x27;s Party) US congressman, founded the ‘’Alliance Vindicator’’; it was published until 1901. John S. Bagwell bought the ‘’Hopkins County Echo’’ in 1916. In 1924, the ‘’Texas Star’’ was merged into the ‘’Daily News Telegram.’’ The ‘’Daily News Telegram’’ later was renamed the ‘’Daily Gazette’’ and still later the ‘’Weekly Gazette’’. Eventually, all these newspapers were merged into the ‘’Sulphur Springs News-Telegram’’ and the ‘’Hopkins County Echo’’, both of which still operate.

In 1857, the city set aside of land for Bright Star University. The Sulphur Springs District Conference High School began in 1877, established on Bright Star University land on College Street. In December 1882, the school became known as Central College. It was owned by the Methodist Episcopal Church. It was later renamed Eastman College and Conservatory of Music and Art under a new charter and after the leading professor. Before 1900, the college burned and Professor Eastman left the area.

The First National Bank of Sulphur Springs received its national charter in 1855. It is now known as City National Bank.

In 1857, the area’s first steam-powered factory was established by the Bell brothers. In the same year, the Morro Castle was built on North Street. Its builders remain unknown.

C. Denton was elected to lead the new city government, which was incorporated during the Reconstruction Era. During the Civil War, the town had lost its charter and had to be incorporated again by the state legislature.

In 1868, federal troops moved into Sulphur Springs and occupied the city for two years during Reconstruction, in an effort to protect freedmen after emancipation. Upon their departure and the end of the military occupation, A. J. Bridges was elected as mayor.

The construction of a railroad line from Mineola, Texas, in 1872 stimulated growth in the city. Settlers were drawn by tales of the healing powers of the city’s sulfur baths. Due to population growth, the springs of sulfur were gradually covered. None is active today. A rail line was run from Jefferson to Sulphur Springs in 1879. The St. Louis, Arkansas &amp; Texas Railroad (Cotton Belt) was built through Sulphur Springs in 1887 on its way to Commerce and Sherman. The next year, the line was completed to Fort Worth, connecting the city to a major market. In 1891, the bankrupt railroad was sold to Jay Gould interests and renamed the St. Louis Southwestern Railway.

An ice plant was built in 1887. The city’s courthouse, which is still used today, was constructed in 1895. In 1904, wells were dug to supply the city with water. In the same year, a long-distance telephone line was run to nearby Greenville. In 1889, the City National Bank was organized.

After World War II, the city adopted a new council-manager type of government. It stimulated new programs. Industrialization brought new plants and factories to the city. The population has grown as a result, to an estimate of more than 16,000 in 2016.

The dairy industry was a major component of the local economy from the late 1940s through 1995. The Southwest Dairy Museum in the city features artifacts on the history of the dairy industry. The industry began to shrink largely because of declining milk prices, higher labor costs, and large corporations operating industrial-scale dairies.

Large industries in the area today include Pinnacle, Ocean Spray, Grocery Supply, Jeld-Wen, Clayton Home Mfg., Flowserve, and others. For several months in 2012, Hopkins County enjoyed a very low unemployment rate of around 4.5% and over 500 jobs were added.

<text>Crockett is a city and the county seat of Houston County, Texas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 6,332. Houston County is the oldest county and Crockett the fifth-oldest city in Texas.

== History ==

The town was named after Davy Crockett, who had camped nearby on his way to the Alamo; the site was very near the Old San Antonio Road. Andrew Edwards Gossett, a Texas Revolution soldier from Maury, Tennessee, along with his father and brother, donated the land for the town in 1836, and named it after Crockett, whom they had previously known. The town was incorporated in 1837, and a post office was granted the following year. Crockett was connected to Nacogdoches by stage service. In 1839 raids by the Alabama-Coushatta and Cherokee Indians forced the town&#x27;s residents to take shelter in the fortified log courthouse. Crockett was a training center for Confederate conscripts during the Civil War.

The railroad came through in 1872, enabling Crockett to exploit the county&#x27;s timber resources. By 1885 the town was thriving with a population of 1,200, and the following year a school was opened for black girls. It evolved into Mary Allen Junior College, which operated into the 1970s. In 1904 lignite mining started, peaking about 1910. The stands of timber were seriously depleted by the 1920s. The population was over 3,000 in the mid-1920s, and by 1936 it was nearly 4,500. The population of Crockett increased while most of East Texas declined after World War II. It had reached 5,000 by the 1960 census.

During this time, one of the first loop roads in the nation (Loop 304) was built around the city. This traffic reliever was procured through the works of heavyweight politicians who called Crockett home. Blues singer Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins was once arrested in Crockett. In recent years, the economy of Crockett has expanded with the construction of new retail space on Loop 304. Several historic buildings in downtown have been renovated to accommodate new office and service space. Renewed interest in reserves of natural gas in the surrounding area has led to construction of energy infrastructure and receipt of royalty revenues for land.

In 2023, the local Walmart commissioned a mural for their store. When a photo of the completed mural was published in the newspaper, African-Americans were outraged that it included cotton plants. Walmart later removed the mural. 

==Government and infrastructure==

<text>Latexo ( ) is a city in Houston County, Texas, United States. Its population was 232 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Just after 1900, the Louisiana Texas Orchard Company purchased surrounding the settlement and platted a town named &quot;Latexo&quot;, an acronym of the company&#x27;s name. Five schools have been built over the years in the community and the city of Latexo.
The first Bethel school building was on a dirt road that ran parallel with the railroad tracks, about south of the railroad crossing at the north end of the city. This building was later occupied as the home of Cleveland Willis. The second Bethel school built in the community was located on a street that went east from what was at that time the main road that ran south along the railroad tracks. This site in the 1960s and later years was known as the home site of the Stokes Reed family. This building was later sold (around 1930) to the Baptist Church and was used as such for many years.

The third site of the school was located about two houses east of the second site and was the location of what was referred to as the old Ed Burton home, but was the Bill McKinney home in 1961, and later the Clifford Price home. The third school was moved in 1930 to the present location. Two new buildings have been built on the same school property, replacing the previous building.

Famous people include Earlene Brown, athlete

<text>Big Spring is a city in and the county seat of Howard County, Texas, United States, at the crossroads of U.S. Highway 87 and Interstate 20. The population was 26,144 at the 2020 census. Big Spring was established as the county seat of Howard County in 1882; it is the largest community in the county.

The city took its name from the single, large spring that issued into a small gorge between the base of Scenic Mountain and a neighboring hill in the southwestern part of the city limits. Although the name is sometimes still mistakenly pluralized, it is officially singular. &quot;To the native or established residents who may wince at the plural in Big Spring, it should be explained that until about 1916, when for some unexplained reason the name dropped the final &#x27;s&#x27;, the official name of the town was indeed Big Springs.&quot;

== History ==



The area had long been a popular watering hole for Native American residents and nomads, including members of the more recently established Jumano, Apache, and Comanche tribes. The first European to view the site was probably a member of a Spanish expedition exploring the Great Plains from New Mexico. During the 1840s and 1850s, Big Spring was often where Comanches assembled and organized themselves before departing on large-scale raids into northern Mexico during the Comanche-Mexico Wars.

Captain Randolph B. Marcy&#x27;s expedition in 1849 was the first United States expedition to explore and map the area. Marcy marked the spring as a campsite on the Overland Trail to California. The site began to collect inhabitants, and by the late 1870s, a settlement had sprung up to support buffalo hunters who frequented the area. The original settlement consisted largely of hide huts and saloons. Ranching quickly became a major industry in the area; early ranchers included F.G. Oxsheer, C.C. Slaughter, and B.F. Wolcott.

One notable early rancher was Briton Joseph Heneage Finch, the Seventh Earl of Aylesford. Finch purchased of ranchland in the area in 1883, and is credited with building Big Spring&#x27;s first permanent structure, a butcher shop.

The completion of the Texas and Pacific Railroad led to the founding in the early 1880s of Abilene, Colorado City, and Big Spring, three railroading and ranching cities where saloons and gambling dens flourished.

More important in the city&#x27;s history was the discovery of oil in the region during the 1920s. The early discoveries in the area marked the beginning of the oil industry in the Permian Basin area of West Texas, and the oil industry has continued to be a dominant part of the area&#x27;s economy. The oil industry in Big Spring reached its peak during the oil boom of the 1950s.

Another major part of Big Spring&#x27;s economy and life during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s was Webb Air Force Base. It initially opened during World War II as the Big Spring Bombardier School. Following the war, it was converted to a US Air Force training base and was named for James Webb, a Big Spring native who died in action during World War II. Webb Air Force Base was active until 1977, when the base facilities were deeded to the city.

Big Spring was featured in the 1969 film &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, which starred Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight, and received the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1969. The opening scenes featuring Voight, then a relatively unknown actor, playing the character Joe Buck, were filmed in Big Spring and the neighboring city of Stanton.

In 1980, Hollywood returned to Big Spring with the filming of &quot;Hangar 18&quot;, a low-budget science-fiction movie about a space shuttle&#x27;s collision with an alien spacecraft and the ensuing government cover-up. Several local residents were used as on-screen extras.

In 1999, a New York energy company erected the first tower for one of North America&#x27;s largest wind turbines for that time at Big Spring.

The FAI World Hang Gliding Championship was hosted by Big Spring in August 2007.

=== Origin of the name &quot;Big Spring&quot; ===
The area&#x27;s &quot;big spring&quot;, long dry but recently modified to draw water from Comanche Trail Lake, was of major importance to all life in the surrounding area. In the early 1840s, it was the center of a territorial dispute between Comanche and Pawnee tribes, and has been a major watering hole for wildlife and prehistoric people in this semiarid area. Early military scouting reports and pioneer accounts describe the water as cold, clear, and dependable; the spring pool was about deep, with the overflow going only a short distance down the draw before it sank beneath the surface. The spring has mistakenly been described in other writings as being located in Sulphur Draw. It is actually located to the south, near the top of a small, rugged, unnamed draw running eastwards from the spring, and is itself a tributary to Beal&#x27;s Creek, the name given to Sulphur Draw as it flows into, through, and past the city of Big Spring.

Long used by regional inhabitants, both permanent and nomadic, with a large number of locally collected artifacts testifying to its heavy occupation, the spring sat astride the several branches of the later-developed Comanche War Trail as they converged on this important water hole from beyond Texas, coming south across the Northern Plains and the Llano Estacado. From the Big Spring, the war trail continued south via three branches, one to the southeast through the western part of the Concho country; one going almost due south, heading for Castle Gap and Horsehead Crossing on the Pecos River; and one heading west to Willow Springs in the sand country southwest of present Midland, before turning south down the Pecos, all headed ultimately for Mexico. As whites began to settle the western territories, the spring continued to serve as a major watering place on the southern route of the Gold Rush Trail of the early 1850s and continued in use well beyond that time, as the cross-continental trail turned into a major road for later pioneers coming into the area.

The spring was sourced from a relatively small aquifer situated on the northern end of the Edwards Plateau and the southern end of the High Plains, being, structurally, a collecting sink of lower Cretaceous (Fredericksburg) limestones and sands. The spring aquifer held a large quantity of water due to the great number of fractures, solution channels, and interstices in the rocks and underlying sands, although the areal extent of the Big Spring sink is estimated to be only in diameter, with the main area only wide and almost circular, with some ellipticity trending towards the west. The Cretaceous beds subsided about below their normal position, centered on the southeast quarter of Section 12, Block 33 T1S; T&amp;P RR Co survey, and the entire stratum appears to be preserved within the sink, the surface topography roughly following the subsurface subsidence. This writing identifies the sink as one of a number of similar subsurface geologic features in the surrounding area, differing from the Big Spring sink only in the fact that the surface topography above the others, while showing some decline, does not dip low enough to intersect the top of the water tables; hence, no springs could form from the other aquifers. In a passing comment, enigmatic in its content and disappointing in its brevity, the report states no other comparable deep sinks formed elsewhere on the Edwards Plateau.

The same publication suggests the spring&#x27;s discharge volume was in excess of per day at the time of the railroad&#x27;s arrival in the area in the late 1880s. The water was heavily mined by wells built by both the railroad and the early town of Big Spring, greatly in excess of its modest recharge rate, until the water table first dropped below the level of the spring outlet, and finally, was completely depleted by the mid-1920s. The city now artificially fills the spring from its current source of water as a means of allowing residents and visitors to maintain some idea of how it appeared in times past.

== Geography ==
Big Spring is located slightly south of the center of Howard County in the valley of Beals Creek, an eastward-flowing tributary of the Colorado River. Interstate 20 runs through the northern side of the city, with access from exits 174 through 182. I-20 leads east to Abilene and west to Midland. U.S. Route 87 (Gregg Street) until recently ran through the center of Big Spring, leading north to Lubbock and southeast to San Angelo. A bypass to the west of the city now carries US 87, while the old route is now Business US 87.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

Forsan&#x27;s development as a community dates back to the 1920s, when oil was discovered in the area. Oil companies began leasing local land and production from the first oil well began on November 9, 1925. On May 28, 1928, a town site on the ranch of Clayton Stewart was placed on the market. An office was set up and lots were sold at twenty-five dollars each. By December 1928, the growing community was known as Forsan. The name was derived from the fact that four paying oil sands were believed to be present in the area. Drillers would later discover that there were actually at least five sands present. A school and several businesses opened soon after. On March 5, 1929, Forsan&#x27;s post office began operating. A true oil boomtown, Forsan&#x27;s population had already reached 350 by 1931. The Great Depression&#x27;s impact on Forsan was less significant than in other rural Texas towns. The population grew to 400 by 1936.

The Elbow Common School District, based in the community of Elbow, consolidated with Forsan schools in 1960.

In 2014, there were 336 people, according to the United States Census Bureau, with 50 being the average age. In 2016, Jessica Onsurez wrote that residents in the town, which had a decline in the number of businesses, are divided over whether the town is &quot;dying&quot;, in her words, or whether it will rebound. Residents rejected proposals to establish a prison and a manufacturing plant.

<text>Fort Hancock is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Hudspeth County, Texas, United States. Its population was 1,052 at the 2020 census.

Fort Hancock is situated on the Mexico–United States border, across from El Porvenir, Chihuahua. The Fort Hancock–El Porvenir International Bridge connects the two communities, and the Fort Hancock Port of Entry is located on the Texas side.

Texas State Highway 20 and the Union Pacific Railroad run through the town.

==History==
=== Camp Rice and Fort Hancock ===
Fort Hancock began as a military establishment named Camp Rice in 1882, along the San Antonio-El Paso Road. Camp Rice had formerly been located at Fort Quitman, and had been established by troops of the 10th U.S. Cavalry &quot;buffalo soldiers&quot;. Camp Rice did not grow after moving to this community, and rarely hosted more than 60 men. It was renamed Fort Hancock in 1886 after the death of General Winfield Scott Hancock, a hero of the Battle of Gettysburg. The fort was damaged in a flood that year, but rebuilt. It was damaged again by fires in 1889, then abandoned in 1895. The remains of the old fort are located in a cotton field about west of present-day Fort Hancock.

=== Town of Fort Hancock ===
A post office was established in 1886, with Albert Warren as postmaster. In 1887, a new railroad depot was built at Fort Hancock, and by 1890, a town had grown up around it and had a population of 200, a general store, a hotel, and a meat market.

By 1914, the population of the town had dropped to 50, though by 1940, it had increased to 500.

Federal troops were sent to Fort Hancock in 1918 to contain Mexican &quot;bandits and outlaws&quot; operating along the border. The bandits were suspected of being directed by German agents.

In 1995, a 13-year-old Ricardo Soto &quot;trying to get toys for Christmas&quot; fired three rifle shots at a semitrailer traveling along nearby Interstate 10, hoping to blow out a tire so the truck would spill its load. He instead hit the driver of a pickup truck, Alberto Tarango, fatally wounding him. The man succumbed to his injuries two days later.

Officials in Fort Hancock raised the speed limit to in 2006 along their portion of Interstate 10, making it the highest speed limit in the country.

In 2006, CNN did a feature story about Fort Hancock, highlighting the close relationship between families living on the US and Mexican sides of the border. In the introduction, it described how &quot;illegal immigrants risk their lives to cross the border, but not in Fort Hancock, Texas. A casual stroll across the foot bridge gets you in there.&quot; In an interview with Hudspeth County Deputy Sheriff Mike Doyal, he described the border as &quot;just an open footway traffic for people coming across&quot;, and showed one of the four unguarded foot bridges that connect Fort Hancock to Mexico. Doyal spoke fondly of his Mexican neighbors, saying &quot;those are not the people that we have a problem with, because I&#x27;m going to make it real clear that some of those people on the other side are some of the nicest people you would ever want to meet in your life.&quot; CNN described Fort Hancock as &quot;a timeless place&quot;, adding, &quot;for people who live here, the border barely exists. We found these Mexican cattle ranchers moving their herd along the river. A few times the cows [sic] would move into the U.S., the buckaroos rode across the dried-out river and collected their animals.&quot;

The quiescent community described by CNN in 2006 had changed significantly by 2010 when residents became increasingly concerned that violence associated with the Mexican drug trade would spill across the border. In one instance, Deputy Sheriff Doyal announced to townspeople: &quot;We just got word that the cartel has threatened to kill children in schools across the border unless parents paid 5000 pesos.&quot; The county&#x27;s sheriff, Arvin West, cautioned farmers to arm themselves.

The newly erected Mexico–United States barrier is not a continuous wall, but rather a segmented one, at places no more than a fence. This has led many unauthorized migrants to traverse the barrier on the Mexican side in search of a break; breaks are often in remote desert areas like Fort Hancock. This &quot;funnel effect&quot; has contributed to the deaths of thousands of unauthorized migrants, who are frequently found dead in the hot Texas sun. Journalist Joseph J. Kolb interviewed local rancher Lupe Dempsey, who described how &quot;on her doorstep was a 25-year-old man named Juan who, thirsty and disoriented, told how he&#x27;d become lost after illegally crossing the border and had wandered the desert in 110-degree heat.&quot; Kolb added, &quot;His story was not unique to Dempsey and others in this West Texas town, where the 18-foot-high U.S. border fence ends abruptly, giving way to a few strands of barbed wire.&quot;

The singer was not arrested, but a member of his entourage was. Previously, rapper Snoop Dogg, musician Willie Nelson, and actor Armie Hammer had all been arrested separately for drug possession in Sierra Blanca. The United States Border Patrol checkpoint at Sierra Blanca sends the county thousands of drug cases a year and inspects 15,000 to 20,000 vehicles every day. The county is unable to prosecute the vast majority of these cases, as the federal government no longer funds such activities.

== Accidents ==
On July 13, 1944, three Army Air Forces crews from Biggs Army Airfield, 86 miles west of Sierra Blanca, took off on a practice mission. They proceeded to drop 10 practice bombs on Sierra Blanca. Five of the bombs disabled the main line shared by the Southern Pacific and Texas &amp; Pacific Railroads. Another dropped on a gas station driveway, but missed the fuel tanks. No injuries or deaths were reported.

<text>Celeste (&quot;Light Blue&quot;, in Spanish) is a city in Hunt County, in the U.S. state of Texas. The population was 809 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Like many towns in Hunt County, Celeste was a product of railroad development. The townsite was platted in 1886 by the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway north of Kingston, on open prairie already crossed by the Missouri, Kansas and Texas line. This location was chosen in order to ensure that Kingston, whose elected officials had refused to offer incentives to attract the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe to build through their community, would be bypassed by the line as it put down tracks from Paris through Farmersville to Dallas.
Celeste was named for the wife of a Santa Fe official. The two rail lines stimulated rapid growth. A post office opened in Celeste in 1886, and a number of merchants moved their businesses from Kingston to Celeste. By 1888 three churches were holding services in the settlement. The population by the mid-1890s stood at 600, and the community maintained three gristmills and cotton gins, a bank, a weekly newspaper, and a graded public school. Celeste was incorporated in 1900, and its population increased from 671 that year to 850 on the eve of World War I.

By 1914 the community had two banks, three cotton gins, a water works, an ice factory, and a weekly newspaper, as well as some thirty-five other businesses. It reported a population of 1,022 by 1926. Its high school and two elementary schools registered 500 students. Some fifty business establishments, including two banks and a newspaper, were in operation. After the 1920s, however, the population of Celeste fell from 803 in 1933 to 518 in the mid-1960s; businesses correspondingly declined, from thirty to sixteen. After the 1960s the town revived; in 1976 its population was 745. In 1982 the community, where World War II hero Audie Murphy once lived, had a bank, four churches, ten stores, and a school that enrolled 300 students. The population was 733 in 1990 and 817 in 2010.

==Geography==
Celeste is in northwestern Hunt County along U.S. Route 69, which leads northwest to Denison and southeast to Greenville the Hunt county seat. According to the United States Census Bureau, Celeste has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

<text>Commerce is a city in Hunt County, Texas, United States, situated on the eastern edge of North Texas and the western edge of East Texas, in the heart of the Texas Blackland Prairies. The town is south of the Texas/Oklahoma border. Commerce is the second-largest city in Hunt County, with a population of 9,090 at the 2020 census. The city is home to East Texas A&amp;M University, a four-year university of more than 12,000 students that has been in the town since 1894. Commerce is one of the smallest college towns in Texas.

==History==

The town of Commerce was formed when two merchants named William Jernigan and Josiah Jackson established a trading post and mercantile store where the present-day downtown area is. The rural area just to the northeast was an open prairie originally known as Cow Hill. The town was established in 1872 and named &quot;Commerce&quot; due to the thriving economic activity among the cotton fields and ideal farm and ranch lands between the Middle and South Sulphur rivers on the rich, black gumbo prairie in northeast Hunt County. The town incorporated in 1885. Two years later, a railroad was built through Commerce to transport merchandise from Fort Worth, and nine years later, William L. Mayo, a college educator, moved East Texas Normal College from the northeast Texas town of Cooper to Commerce after the original school in Cooper was destroyed in a fire. Mayo continued as president of the college, now known as East Texas A&amp;M University, until his death in 1917 and is buried on the campus grounds.

Commerce was named the &quot;Bois d&#x27;Arc Capital of Texas&quot; (pronounced &quot;bow-dark&quot;) by the Texas Legislature because of its location in the geographic center of the indigenous range of the bois d&#x27;arc tree. The second largest bois d&#x27;arc tree in Texas, &quot;Big Max&quot;, recognized by the National Forests Famous and Historic Trees, is located within the city limits. Held every September, the annual Bois d&#x27;Arc Bash pays homage to the native trees which played a vital part in the frontier days, providing foundations, fences and weapons of the Native Americans. The Bash celebrates with arts &amp; crafts vendors, food, parade, kids&#x27; game area, pageant, wine, musical entertainment, 5K run, and car &amp; truck show.

<text>Greenville ( ) is a city in Hunt County, Texas, United States, located in Northeast Texas approximately northeast of Dallas, Texas and northwest of Canton, Texas. It is the county seat and most populous city of Hunt County. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 28,164.

Greenville was named for Thomas J. Green, a significant contributor to the founding of the Texas Republic.

==History==

Greenville was founded in 1846. The city was named after Thomas J. Green, a significant contributor to the establishment of the Texas Republic. He later became a member of the Congress of the Texas Republic.

As the Civil War loomed, Greenville was divided over the issue of secession, as were several area towns and counties. Greenville attorney and State Senator Martin D. Hart was a prominent Unionist. He formed a company of men who fought for the Union in Arkansas, even as other Greenville residents fought for the Confederacy. The divided nature of Greenville and Hunt County is noted by a historical marker in &quot;The SPOT&quot; Park at 2800 Lee Street in downtown Greenville. In the post-Civil War era, Greenville&#x27;s economy became partly dependent on cotton, as the local economy entered a period of transition.

With a population of 12,384 in the 1920 census, the city was the 20th-most populous city in Texas at the time.

In World War II, the Mexican Escuadrón 201 was stationed in Greenville while training at nearby Majors Field.

Greenville was notorious for a large sign, installed on July 7, 1921, over Lee Street, the main street in the downtown district, between the train station and the bus station in the 1920s to 1960s. The sign read: &quot;Welcome to Greenville, The Blackest Land, The Whitest People.&quot; In pre-civil rights America, the phrase &quot;That&#x27;s mighty White of you&quot; meant that you were honest, not like suspect Blacks. The sign thus acquired racial overtones, and the original sign was taken down and placed into storage on April 13, 1965, possibly at the urging of Texas Governor John Connally, who had made a visit to the town weeks before. In 1968, Greenville&#x27;s Sybil Maddux had the sign reinstalled, with the wording modified to read &quot;The Greatest People&quot;; the original sign is in the collection of the Audie Murphy American Cotton Museum.

In 1957, Greenville annexed the small town of Peniel, which had been founded in 1899 as a Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene community centered around Texas Holiness University. The annexation was approved by the citizens of Peniel, which at the time had a population around 157.

On May 12, 2011, a white buffalo was born near Greenville during a thunderstorm on the ranch of Arby Littlesoldier, who identified himself as a great-great-grandson of Sitting Bull. A public naming ceremony and dedication was held on June 29, 2011, during which the male calf was officially given the name &quot;Lightning Medicine Cloud&quot;. However, on August 21, 2012, Lightning Medicine Cloud died. The sheriff&#x27;s department declared it had died from a bacterial infection, but the owners disagree, claiming that the buffalo was allegedly skinned by an unknown party.

<doc id="136175" wikidata="Q981491" url="?curid=136175" title="Quinlan, Texas">
<text>Quinlan is a rural city in the southern part of Hunt County, Texas, United States, within the Dallas–Fort Worth metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 1,414. It is west of Lake Tawakoni.

==History==
The city of Quinlan began about 1892 as a stop on the Texas Midland Railroad, which was owned by famed bond investor Hetty Green, called by the contemporary press &quot;The Witch of Wall Street&quot;. The railroad was operated by her son, Edward H.R. Green. Texas Midland became a subsidiary of the Houston &amp; Texas Central Railroad, and the city which built up around a depot constructed here between the towns of Roberts and Greenville was named Quinlan in honor of George A. Quinlan, the general manager of the Houston &amp; Texas Central railroad.

The post office opened in Quinlan in 1894, and by 1896, the city was incorporated. Harry Ford served as first mayor. Quinlan soon became the center of a large agricultural area, providing a railroad shipping point for growers of cotton and other crops. By the early 20th century, the town boasted three cotton gins, numerous businesses and fraternal organizations, banks, schools, churches, and homes.

Oil exploration and production overtook cotton farming as the area&#x27;s economic base in the 1930s and 1940s, and the construction of Lake Tawakoni in the 1950s brought another economic boost to the community.

Some of the earliest settlers were John M. Cook and R. K. Epperson, who moved their businesses from Roberts. The settlement received a post office in 1894, and by 1900, its population had reached 362. This growth, no doubt induced by the presence of the railroad, continued through the first quarter of the 20th century. In 1904, 463 persons lived in Quinlan. The number rose to 537 by 1910 and 600 by 1914, when Quinlan had 20 businesses, including a bank and a weekly newspaper. In 1925, this &quot;retail trade center for southern Hunt, northern Kaufman and Van Zandt Counties&quot; had an elementary school, a high school, and 35 businesses, and managed a cotton harvest of some 5,000 bales. In 1933, Quinlan had 512 residents and 30 businesses; in 1952, the population of 599 supported 25 businesses; in 1964, the community had 621 persons and 22 businesses. After the mid-1960s, Quinlan grew considerably, largely due to its proximity to Lake Tawakoni. Quinlan had a population of 900 in 1976 and 1,002 in 1988, when it had 51 businesses. In 1990, its population was 1,360.

<text>Borger ( ) is the largest city in Hutchinson County, Texas, United States. The population was 12,551 at the 2020 census. Borger is named for businessman Asa Philip &quot;Ace&quot; Borger, who also established the Hutchinson County seat of Stinnett and several other small towns in Texas and Oklahoma.

== History ==

Ace Borger and his business partner John R. Miller purchased a townsite near the Canadian River in March 1926 after the discovery of oil in the vicinity. Within a few months, the boomtown had swollen to a population of 45,000, most lured by sensational advertising and &quot;black gold&quot;. In October 1926, the city charter was adopted, and Miller was elected mayor. By this time, the Panhandle &amp; Santa Fe Railway had completed the spur line to Borger, a post office had opened, and a school district was established. The boomtown of Borger soon had steam-generated electricity, telephone service, a hotel, and a jail. Regionalist artist Thomas Hart Benton depicted this period of Borger in his large painting &quot;Boomtown&quot;.

In the months that followed, oilmen, roughnecks, prospectors, panhandlers, and fortune seekers were joined by cardsharks, prostitutes, bootleggers, and drug dealers. The city became known as &quot;Booger Town&quot;, as it attracted criminals and fugitives from the law. The town government soon fell under control of an organized crime syndicate led by Mayor Miller&#x27;s shady associate, &quot;Two-Gun Dick&quot; Herwig. Dixon Street (now Tenth Street) was the &quot;red-light&quot; district, housing brothels, dance halls, speakeasies, and gambling dens. Murder and robbery became an everyday occurrence, and illegal moonshining and home brewing flourished under the fatherly watch of Herwig and his henchmen, including W. J. (Shine) Popejoy, the king of the Texas bootleggers. Borger became so notorious that in the spring of 1927, Texas Governor Dan Moody sent a force of Texas Rangers to rein in the town. The Texas Rangers were led by Captains Frank Hamer and Thomas R. Hickman. (Hamer would go on to later fame and even infamy as the man who killed Bonnie and Clyde.)

The Rangers did have a stabilizing effect, but Borger still struggled with lawlessness and violence into the 1930s, climaxing with the murder of District Attorney John A. Holmes by an assassin on September 18, 1929. This event caused Governor Moody to impose martial law for a month and send in state troops to help rid the town of its criminal element. Eventually, Borger settled down, but not before town founder Ace Borger was shot and killed at the post office by Arthur Huey on August 31, 1934. Huey was county treasurer and was irked at Ace Borger for not bailing him out of jail on an embezzlement charge. Huey shot Borger five times with a Colt .45 pistol, even pulling Borger&#x27;s own pistol out of his clothing and shooting him again, along with others there in the post office.

By the late 1930s, Borger was pushed from one era to another by the Great Depression. Phillips Petroleum and others profited from the oil fields in the area, but during this time, the price of oil and gas dropped, ending the &quot;boom&quot; and the rapid growth of Borger. Carbon black plants added black soot to the Dust Bowl storms, covering the town in layers of dark grime. &quot;Okie&quot; migrants forced off their foreclosed farms back in Oklahoma found work in Borger plants and refineries. The Works Project Administration provided the town with new red-brick streets as the ramshackle shacks throughout town were replaced by more permanent buildings. During World War II, synthetic rubber and other petroleum products became important in the Borger area. By the 1960s, the Borger area was one of the largest producers of oil, carbon black, and petrochemicals and supplies in the state. The creation of nearby Lake Meredith also added to the town&#x27;s economy as an important recreational area.

Today, Borger remains an important shipping point for agricultural produce, as well as for the petroleum products produced there. It is the home of the world&#x27;s largest inland petrochemical complexes. Chevron-Phillips Chemical Company produces specialty chemicals. Solvay produces RYTON PPS plastics. Phillips 66 Petroleum Company processes crude oil and natural gas liquids. Agrium manufactures nitrogen fertilizer in its Borger plant. Borger also has Sid Richardson Carbon Company, which produces rubber-grade carbon black used to strengthen rubber tires, and Orion Engineered Carbons, Inc., which produces a variety of carbon blacks at its Borger facility. The original townsite is said to have been founded around 1898 by John F. Weatherly, a rancher who built a dugout and gave the future town the grandiose name of Granada. Weatherly&#x27;s wife wanted it named after her former home—a town in West Virginia called Isom.

In 1900, Weatherly opened a store in his ranchhouse, which also became the first post office. Mrs. Weatherly opened a café and the community had a school opened by 1907. In October 1919, the mail was diverted through Plemons and the Isom post office closed.

The Weatherlys lost interest in the town they founded and moved to the nearby town of Panhandle in 1922, but they retained ownership of all that was Isom. When oil was discovered in early 1926, Weatherly returned and moved the town to the oilfield spur of the railroad near Borger.

Isom was platted with all lots south of First Street being Isom, Texas, and all streets north in Borger. From June to December 1926, the towns were rivals.

Although the town had a railroad depot, several oil-well supply warehouses, and no shortage of would-be citizens, a petition signed by 1,200 residents in early December declared Borger the winner. Isom&#x27;s school merged with Borger&#x27;s schools, driving the last stake into Isom.

The town has the dubious distinction of being the oldest of the townsites annexed by Borger.

During the winter of 1982–1983, Borger received a total of 58.7 inches of snow. This is the most snow that any Texas town has ever received during a winter season.

==Politics==

Borger and Hutchinson County are among the strongest Republican voting districts in Texas and the nation, having cast GOP ballots at the presidential level in all elections for more than a half century. Even Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona, who received fewer votes nationally and in Texas versus native Texan Lyndon B. Johnson, won Hutchinson County, 5,358 to 4,625. In 1984, Ronald W. Reagan carried 9,078 votes in Hutchinson County to only 2,052 for the Democrat Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota. In 1996, Robert J. Dole of Kansas polled 6,350 votes in Hutchinson County to 2,553 for incumbent President Bill Clinton. H. Ross Perot, the Dallas industrialist, received 864 votes. The only Democrat since Lyndon Johnson to exceed 3,600 votes in Hutchinson County was Jimmy Carter in 1976, but Gerald R. Ford handily defeated him in the county.

In the 2008 presidential primaries, Hutchinson County cast 3,170 votes in the Republican race and 1,538 in the Democratic contest. In the United States Senate primary, 2,875 votes were cast in the Republican primary, largely for incumbent Senator John Cornyn, and 1,211 votes were cast in the Democratic portion of the ballot.

In the 2008 presidential election, Hutchinson County cast 7,361 votes for John McCain and 1,322 for Barack Obama.

<text>Bryson is a city in Jack County, Texas, United States. As of the 2020 census, its population was 430.

==Geography==
Bryson is located in western Jack County and is situated southwest of Jacksboro, the county seat, along U.S. Highway 380. US 380 continues southwest to Graham, the county seat of Young County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Bryson has a total area of , of which are land and , or 7.64%, are water. The water area encompasses Lake Bryson, a reservoir northwest of the city. Bryson is in the Rock Creek watershed, flowing south to the Brazos River.

==History==

The community was first settled in the late 19th century. Originally known as &quot;Mount Hecla&quot;, a post office opened under that name in 1878. Henry Bryson built the area&#x27;s first residence, a log cabin, that same year. The community was later renamed after him. This change was officially recognized in 1884, when the local post office took the name &quot;Bryson&quot;. Mr. Bryson went on to serve as County Commissioner. Early pioneer family names of Bryson were Blount, Chambers, Clayton, Cook, Crumpton, Cullers, Enlow, Epperson, Henderson, Keyser, Kuykendall, McCloud, Moore, Raley, Shanafelt and Vanhooser.

The Chicago, Rock Island and Texas Railway, a subsidiary of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, reached Bryson in the fall of 1902. Although oil had been discovered in Jack County as early as 1898, it wasn&#x27;t until the mid-1920s that Bryson became an oil processing center for local producers. The resulting population boom led to the community being known as Jack County&#x27;s &quot;second city&quot; (after Jacksboro).

On June 6, 1929, the town incorporated a mayor-council form of government. Men who served there include B.B. Bryson, Sam Cullers, L.O. Moore, J.R. Clayton, Willis Williams, and Williard Schlitter. The town had a population of 641 in the 1930 census. A 1938 oil boom in Bryson helped the population explode, with many people forced to live in tents. In 1940, the census dropped back to 806. As oil production declined, so did the population. The low point occurred in 1970, when only 455 people lived within the city limits. During the latter half of the 20th century, Bryson slowly grew to over 500 residents. In 1988, seven businesses were serving the community. Reportedly, 22 businesses were in Bryson as of 2004.

In 1875, the first school was started at a log cabin and was named &quot;Cottonwood&quot;. As its population grew, its log cabin school was replaced with a frame building, which was later replaced by a two-story building. In 1885, the school was renamed &quot;Bryson Academy&quot; with two new instructors named J.T. Lippard, and C.B Hickman. In 1905, the two-story frame was turned into a brick structure for elementary and high school. In 1938, the school built a gym. Later, a new high school was built and the old brick building was turned into an AG shop. In 1957, a new elementary school building was built. In 2012, the old school was razed and a new school was raised.

==History==
Jacksboro was first settled in the 1850s, with newcomers attracted by land offers from the Texas Emigration and Land Office. Originally called &quot;Mesquiteville&quot;, the community grew up along the banks of Lost Creek and spread out over the pastureland between Lost Creek and the waters of the West Fork of Keechi Creek. It was renamed &quot;Jacksboro&quot; in 1858, when it became the county seat, in honor of brothers William and Patrick Jack, veterans of the Texas Revolution. Regular postal service began in 1859. Jacksboro was located on one route of the Butterfield Overland Mail.

The county was one of the few in Texas to vote against secession before the Civil War. It continued to suffer from Native American raids until Fort Richardson was built and garrisoned in 1870 south of Jacksboro. The town gained national attention in 1871 when two Kiowa chiefs, Satanta and Big Tree, were tried for murder there.

The arrival of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Texas Railroad in 1898 increased the town&#x27;s commercial importance to the surrounding region, enhancing it as a center of trade. The completion of highways and other roads later on also connected the town to other markets.

Fort Richardson State Historical Park is in the southern part of the city. Jacksboro claims to have the first state 4-H club, formed in the 1910s.

<doc id="136184" wikidata="Q973102" url="?curid=136184" title="Edna, Texas">
<text>Edna is a city and the county seat of Jackson County, Texas, United States. The population was 5,499 at the 2010 census and 5,987 at the 2020 census.

Edna is the gateway to Lake Texana, which covers the site of Texana, Texas. Edna has a hospital, convalescent home, library, museum, city park with swimming pool, three banks, two savings and loan associations, a country club with a nine-hole golf course, and Oak Creek Village, a retirement community. It is the center of a prosperous agricultural area with petroleum and natural gas production and has an active chamber of commerce, oilfield service industries, and two grain elevators.

==History==

Edna, the county seat of Jackson County, was established in 1882 when the New York, Texas and Mexican Railway line was built from Rosenberg to Victoria and bypassed Texana, then the county seat. Construction of the railroad began in September 1881. Edna was laid out on land owned by Mrs. Lucy Flournoy, who conveyed right-of-way and a half interest in the townsite to the railroad, which was promoted and built by Italian Count Joseph Telfener. The town was named for a daughter of the count. The NYT&amp;M, nicknamed the &quot;Macaroni&quot;, was constructed by Italian laborers, most of whom were brought from Lombardy by Telfener. After completion of the road, the majority of the crew remained in the area and established homes. The first train arrived on July 4, 1882; the first merchant was Gideon Egg, who moved his general merchandise store from Texana in 1882, and the first child born in the new community was Edna Louise Traylor.

In an election of January 22, 1883, residents voted to make Edna the county seat in place of Texana. The contract for a new courthouse was awarded on February 11, 1884. A post office opened in 1886. The first church congregations in Edna were the Methodist and Presbyterian, whose memberships moved from Texana almost intact. The latter brought their 1859 sanctuary with them overland. The building was also used by other denominations for worship services and is now the oldest public building remaining in the county. The Texana Presbyterian Church has been restored and serves in Edna as an area cultural center. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark.

The first newspaper in Edna was the &quot;Jackson County Progress&quot;. The newspaper plant, along with a large part of the business district, was destroyed in 1906 in the town&#x27;s second disastrous fire. Succeeding the &quot;Progress&quot; was the &quot;Edna Herald&quot;, first published on November 22, 1906.

The 1954 Supreme Court case &quot;Hernandez v. Texas&quot; concerned the racial context of the jury selection for a trial that took place in Edna. The landmark decision of the case determined that Mexican Americans and all other racial groups in the United States had equal protection under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

==History==
The City of Ganado was a ranching community when it was first settled. Most settlers lived near Mustang Creek and traveled to Texana, Victoria and Indianola for supplies. 
Jackson County&#x27;s &quot;second city,&quot; Ganado was originally known as Mustang Settlement, after nearby Mustang Creek. Cattle ranching was the primary economic engine and herds were driven to Louisiana for sale and later to Kansas City. That came to an abrupt end with the coming of the railroad in 1882. As the story goes, a railroad official looked out the window of a train car and saw a large herd of cattle. He decided the area should be called Ganado, which means &quot;cattle&quot; in Spanish. Thus Ganado was named in 1882.

Scandinavian immigrants bought land and began farming in 1891. A second wave of immigration brought Germans and Bohemians in the 1880s and 1890s. Jim McFarland moved his general store from its earlier location on McFarland Creek to a site in town. After McFarland died, Thomas Babcock-who was also the town&#x27;s first postmaster, bought the remaining stock and continued a store in the building. Babcock&#x27;s establishment, later known as the Old Texas House, provided supplies to local ranchers. Soon afterwards, Babcock also established the first residence and first cotton gin in Ganado. In 1891 T. N. Mauritz opened the first bank in Ganado. By 1909 the town had sixty businesses. When the railroad was built through, Ganado grew almost overnight into a bustling city. New homes, hotels, and businesses sprang up quickly. The city incorporated in 1909.

By 1914 the town was thriving with a rice mill and storage facilities, 750 citizens, a school district and a weekly newspaper. By 1937, Main Street was paved, concrete sidewalks were added and water lines were installed. By 1950 the population had increased to 1,253.

The Little School of the 400 was created in 1957 to meet the educational needs of Spanish-speaking children in Texas who were being discriminated against for their lack of knowledge of the English language. The goal of the program was to teach 400 basic English words to help Spanish-speaking children to manage instruction given in English in the regular public educational system. Under the leadership of Felix Tijerina, LULAC Council 60, of Houston, Texas, chose Ganado to be its first community to pilot the program. The program went on to become very successful and the state of Texas adopted it as their own. It later became a precursor to the national Head Start Program.

In 1963, a municipal bond was overwhelmingly approved for $60,000. This bond would be separated into two parts: $44,000 for a new city hall and $16,000 for new fire truck and equipment. The Council at that time were Mayor W.W. Brandes, Councilmen Dr. C.L. Bishop and J.B. Housson. The open house for new building was on May 3, 1964. In 1988 forty-three businesses served 1,770 citizens. In 1990 the population was 1,701, increasing to 1,915 in the 2000 Census. As of the 2010 Census, the population is 2,003. Many descendants of the early pioneer families still live in the city today .

<text>Jasper is a city in and the county seat of Jasper County, Texas, United States. Its population was 6,884 at the 2020 U.S. Census, down from 7,590 at the 2010 U.S. Census. Jasper is situated in the Deep East Texas subregion, about west of the Texas-Louisiana state line. Jasper (the &quot;Butterfly Capital of Texas&quot;) holds an annual Butterfly Festival the first Saturday in October to celebrate the migration of the monarch butterflies.

==History==

===19th century===
The area, which was then part of Mexican Texas, was settled around 1824 by John Bevil. Thirty families occupied the settlement as early as 1830, when it was known as &quot;Snow River&quot;, after John R. Bevil, a hero of the American Revolution.

In 1835, the town was renamed after William Jasper, a soldier from the American Revolution, who was killed attempting to plant the American flag at the storming of Savannah in 1779. Jasper was one of the 23 original counties when the Republic of Texas was created in 1836. Jasper became the county seat in 1844 and became part of the United States with the annexation of Texas in 1845.
During the Civil War, the town housed a Confederate quartermaster depot and served as a major center for Confederate communication, transportation, and supply. Jasper was a Confederate Army headquarters for a nine-county area. Following the war, Union troops led by General George Custer occupied Jasper, camping in the town square.

Educational institutions included the Jasper Male and Female High School, which operated until 1878, when it became the Southeast Texas Male and Female College, and Jasper Collegiate Institute, which operated from 1851 until 1874. The population declined to 360 in 1870, reflecting the hardships of the Civil War, but by 1885 had risen to 1,000.

In 1896, Jasper had a population of 1,200. With the arrival of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway early in the 20th century, Jasper grew into a center for the manufacture of timber products. Lumber from two sawmills, with a daily capacity of 125,000 board feet (295 m3), goods from basket and stave factories, logs, ties, poles, and pulpwood were shipped in 200 cars per month.

===20th century===
In 1901, the town of Jasper was robbed. The post office safe and the county treasurer&#x27;s safe were blown open and robbed. The thieves set a fire, and as the town had no fire department, the entire town was completely destroyed. Damages were estimated at $100,000. What was stolen from the safes was unknown. The thieves escaped.

Jasper served as headquarters for the Lower Neches Valley Authority&#x27;s construction program, including Dam &quot;B&quot; at Town Bluff and engineering and surveying for a dam at Magee Bend on the Angelina River. Local farmers raised broiler chickens and beef, and in the 1950s turned to dairying. Jasper also became the headquarters of the Morgan and Lindsey chain of variety stores (otherwise known as dime-stores), which at one time operated 85 outlets in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.

In June 1998, the murder of James Byrd Jr. catapulted Jasper into national news and led to the creation of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Three men—John William King, Lawrence Russell Brewer, and Shawn Berry—were tried and convicted of capital murder. King and Brewer received the death penalty, while Berry, who was the only suspect who cooperated during the investigation and implicated King and Brewer, was sentenced to life in prison. Brewer was executed on September 21, 2011. King was executed on April 24, 2019.

===21st century===
In 2000, Jasper had 8,247 residents and around 250 businesses. Jasper was one of the primary locations for the recovery of the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; wreckage in February 2003.

Jasper was greatly affected by Hurricane Rita on September 25, 2005, as it moved inland. The city suffered considerable damage and was left without power or potable water for about three and a half weeks.

The Jasper Arboretum Project began in 2000, and the Outdoor Learning Center was added in 2012 to create of public gardens, walking trails, a master gardener greenhouse, and a nature classroom.

In 2012, Jasper returned to national attention during a bitterly fought political feud over the hiring and firing of Jasper&#x27;s first black police chief, Rodney Pearson. To fire Pearson, two black city council members were recalled in the narrowly divided city. Free of Voting Rights Act preclearance requirements, Jasper is moving to annex largely white suburbs. The feud highlighted Jasper&#x27;s persistent struggle with racism throughout its history.

On July 8, 2024, the western part of Jasper was struck by a low-end EF2 tornado that was spawned by the outer bands of Hurricane Beryl. Many trees, power poles, and structures were damaged, and one person was injured.

<doc id="136196" wikidata="Q128282" url="?curid=136196" title="Beaumont, Texas">
<text>Beaumont is a city in the U.S. state of Texas. It is the county seat of Jefferson County, within the Beaumont–Port Arthur metropolitan area, located in Southeast Texas on the Neches River about east of Houston (city center to city center). With a population of 115,282 at the 2020 census, Beaumont is the largest municipality by population near the Louisiana border. Its metropolitan area was the 10th largest in Texas in 2020, and 130th in the United States.

The city of Beaumont was founded in 1838. The pioneer settlement had an economy based on the development of lumber, farming, and port industries. In 1892, Joseph Eloi Broussard opened the first commercially successful rice mill in Texas, stimulating development of rice farming in the area; he also started an irrigation company (since 1933, established as the Lower Neches Valley Authority) to support rice culture. Rice became an important commodity crop in Texas and is now cultivated in 23 counties.

A big change occurred in 1901 with the Spindletop gusher, which demonstrated that a huge oil field lay underneath and adjacent to the city. With Spindletop, several energy companies developed in Beaumont, and some remain. The area rapidly developed as one of the country&#x27;s major petrochemical refining areas. Along with Port Arthur and Orange, Beaumont forms the Golden Triangle, a major industrial area on the Texas Gulf Coast.

Beaumont is home to Lamar University, a national Carnegie doctoral research university with over 14,000 students, including undergraduates and postgraduates. Over the years, several corporations have been based in this city, including Gulf States Utilities, which had its headquarters in Beaumont until its takeover by Entergy Corporation in 1994. GSU&#x27;s Edison Plaza headquarters remains the tallest building in Beaumont.

The ExxonMobil Beaumont Refinery and Petrochemical Complex is the largest private employer in the city and occupies more than 2,000 acres of the city and port.

== History ==
In 1824 Noah and Nancy Tevis settled on the west bank of the Neches River and developed a farm. Soon after that, a small community grew up around the farm, which was named &quot;Tevis Bluff&quot; or &quot;Neches River Settlement&quot;. In 1835 the land of Tevis, together with the nearby community of &quot;Santa Anna&quot; (in total, ), was purchased by Henry Millard (–1844), Joseph Pulsifer (1805–1861), and Thomas Byers Huling (1804–1865). They began planning a town to be laid out on this land. Their partnership, J.P. Pulsifer and Company, controlled the first upon which the town was founded. This town was named Beaumont, after Mary Dewburleigh Barlace Warren Beaumont, the wife of Henry Millard. They added more property for a total of 200 acres.

Beaumont became a town on December 16, 1838. Beaumont&#x27;s first mayor was Alexander Calder. From the town&#x27;s founding in 1835, business activities included real estate, transportation, and retail sales. Later, other businesses were formed, especially in railroad construction and operation, new building construction, lumber sales, and communications. The Port of Beaumont became a successful regional shipping center. Beaumont was a small center for cattle raisers and farmers in its early years. With an active riverport by the 1880s, it became an important lumber and rice-milling town. The city exported rice as a commodity crop. Beaumont&#x27;s lumber boom, which reached its peak in the late 19th century, was stimulated by the rebuilding and expansion of the railroads in the state and region after the Civil War.

The Beaumont Rice Mill, founded in 1892 by Joseph Eloi Broussard, was the first commercially successful rice mill in Texas. In addition, Broussard cofounded the Beaumont Irrigation Company in 1898 to operate an irrigation system to support rice culture. The company along with four others established around the same time helped stimulate the expansion of rice cultivation from 1500 acres in 1892 to 400,000 acres in 23 counties by his death in 1956. The other companies were The Port Arthur Rice and Irrigation Company, The McFaddin-Wiess-Kyle Canal Company, the Treadaway or Neches Canal Company, and the Taylors-Hillebrand complex. The holdings of those companies formed the basis for the Lower Neches Valley Authority established by the state legislature in 1933.

The rise of Beaumont&#x27;s mill economy drew many new residents to the city, many of them immigrants. By the early 20th century, the city was served by the Southern Pacific; Kansas City Southern, Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe; and Missouri Pacific railroad systems.
Oil was discovered at nearby Spindletop on January 10, 1901. Spindletop became the first major oil field and one of the largest in American history. With the discovery of oil at Spindletop, Beaumont&#x27;s population more than tripled in two months from 9,000 in January 1901 to 30,000 in March 1901.

William Casper Tyrrell, nicknamed &quot;Captain W.C.&quot;, was a leading businessman and oil tycoon in the city in the early 20th century, developing businesses during the Texas Oil Boom. An entrepreneur from Pennsylvania and Iowa, he arrived after the gusher at Spindletop, and invested in development of a commercial port in the city, and an irrigation system to support the local rice industry, as well as residential and retail development of suburban property. He was also a philanthropist. He purchased and donated First Baptist Church, whose congregation had moved to a new facility, to use as the city&#x27;s first public library, now known as the Tyrrell Historical Library.

When the city became a major center for defense shipbuilding during World War II, tens of thousands of rural Texans migrated there for the new high-paying jobs. The Roosevelt administration ordered the defense industry to be integrated, and many Southern white males were working closely with black males for the first time. Housing was scarce in the crowded city, and racial tensions increased. In June 1943 after workers at the Pennsylvania shipyards in Beaumont learned that a white woman had accused a black man of raping her, nearly 2,000 went to the jail where a suspect was being held, attracting more men along the way and reaching a total of 4,000. Ultimately the white mob rioted for three days, destroying major black neighborhoods and killing five persons. No one was prosecuted for the deaths. The riot in Beaumont was one of several in 1943 which centered in the defense industry, including Los Angeles, Detroit, and Mobile, Alabama as well as other cities across the country. The wartime social disruption was similar to war time riots which had occurred in other parts of the country during and following World War I.

During the war years, airmen cadets from the Royal Air Force, flying from their training base at Terrell, Texas, routinely flew to Beaumont on training flights. The community served as a stand-in for the British for Paris, France, which was the same distance from London, England as Beaumont is from Terrell.

In the postwar years, Beaumont&#x27;s port continued in importance. As was typical with other cities, post-war highway construction led to the development of new suburbs and dispersal of the population in search of new housing. Recently, there has been some renewal in Downtown Beaumont and in other areas of the city.

In 1996, the Jefferson County courts, located in Beaumont, became the first court in the nation to implement electronic filing and service of court documents. This eliminated the need for law firms to print and mail reams of documents.

In 2005 and 2008, Beaumont and surrounding areas suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Ike, respectively. Mandatory evacuations were issued in advance of both storms.

In August 2017, Beaumont and surrounding areas experienced severe flooding as a result of Hurricane Harvey. Due to the flooding, Baptist Hospital of Southeast Texas evacuated all of its highest level of acuity patients with the help of National Guard helicopters. In addition, many Beaumont residents had to be rescued by both boats and helicopters as a result of the floodwaters. , many residents in the area are still attempting to recover from the hurricane as the city received emergency assistance.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 3.53%, are water.

Beaumont lies on Texas&#x27; coastal plain, about inland from the Gulf of Mexico, east of Houston, and just south of the dense pine forests of East Texas. The city is bordered on the east by the Neches River and to the north by Pine Island Bayou. Before being settled, the area was crisscrossed by numerous small streams. Most of these streams have since been filled in or converted for drainage purposes. The island directly across from Riverfront Park is called Trinity Island. There are also three other islands in the Neches River around the downtown area/port: Harbor, Smith and Clark. Beaumont is relatively flat compared to other Texas cites at being 16 ft. above sea level. South of Beaumont, Port Arthur is only 7 ft. above sea level.

===Annexations===
Several towns and communities have been absorbed into the city of Beaumont. These include: Amelia, established in 1885 and incorporated into Beaumont in 1956; Elizabeth, the depot of Amelia that was established around 1903 or after and annexed into Beaumont in 1957; Elwood, established sometimes in the late 1800s, changed to Voth in 1902, and annexed into Beaumont in 1957; Guffey, post office was established in 1901 and closed in 1925 but is part of Beaumont now; Santa Anna, became part of Beaumont when it was founded; Tevis Bluff, became part of Beaumont when it was founded in 1835.

=== Architecture ===

Beaumont has 8 buildings over tall, the tallest being the Edison Plaza, which is tall. The old Edson Hotel, built in 1928 is nearly the same height at . One of the most prominent downtown buildings is the 15-story San Jacinto Building. Built in 1921, it sports one of the largest four faced clock towers in the nation, each dial being in diameter. In 1922 the 11-story Hotel Beaumont was built across the street from the San Jacinto. The Hotel Beaumont bears a resemblance to the old Winecoff Hotel in Atlanta.

The second oil boom of 1925 brought more people and wealth to Beaumont, the same year the 12-story American National Bank Building (now Orleans Building), was erected, and in 1926 Forrest Goodhue built the 12-story Goodhue Building which included a penthouse. In 1928, the Edson Hotel was built. No other buildings were built until Century Tower in 1962 and in 1982 Edison Plaza was built. In 1994 the 12-story LaSalle Hotel, built in 1927, was demolished.

The Jefferson Theatre was built in 1927 by the Jefferson Amusement Company for $1 million and was Beaumont&#x27;s showpiece for many years. In 1928 the City Hall and Auditorium was built. It is now the Julie Rogers Theater.

Beaumont&#x27;s Jefferson County Courthouse is one of the tallest county courthouses in the state and is an excellent example of Art Deco architecture. Across the street from the Jack Brooks Federal Building is the Kyle Building, built in 1933. The storefront was recently restored and is considered to be one of the best examples of Zig-Zag architecture in Texas. The Oaks Historic District has many restored historic homes.

=== Pollution ===
The Beaumont–Port Arthur region has historically been cited as one of the most polluted urban areas in the United States due to various energy industries and chemical plants in the area. Even so, , the Beaumont-Port Arthur region was not under any Environmental Protection Agency non-attainment restrictions; however, counties in the Greater Houston area, the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, and El Paso were. , the Beaumont-Port Arthur area was not under any Texas Commission on Environmental Quality attainment compliance deadlines. Regardless, according to an article published in 2007 focusing on Port Arthur, a neighboring city to the southeast of Beaumont, pollution was believed to have caused some area residents to become sick. This has generated debates throughout the local media.

=== Climate ===
The city of Beaumont experiences a humid subtropical climate and is within the Piney Woods region of eastern Texas. The area around Beaumont receives the most rainfall in the state, and some of the most rain in the country: more than annually. The city has two distinct seasons, a wet season from April to October and a dry season from November to March. Hurricanes also pose a threat to the city and greater metropolitan area.

Hurricane Rita in 2005 and Hurricane Ike in 2008 both caused significant damage. Both Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and Tropical Storm Imelda in 2019 caused historic flooding throughout the city. Hurricane Laura in 2020 posed a significant threat to the town, as it was forecasted to make landfall at the border of Texas and Louisiana, almost following the same track as Hurricane Rita in 2005. The storm turned more northerly close to landfall, and spared Beaumont the worst impacts and damage. Minor damage was reported with winds gusting around hurricane-force for a short period of time as Laura moved over Lake Charles, Louisiana. Also, Hurricane Delta in 2020 passed near the region as it made landfall in Southwest Louisiana. Impacts were about the same with Delta as they were with Laura.

On August 18, 2009, a tornado hit the west side of Beaumont, causing damage to cars and several local businesses. Injuries were minimal.

While wintry precipitation is unusual, it does occur. The most recent significant wintry event to occur was December 8, 2017 when the Southeast Texas Regional Airport recorded of snowfall. December 11, 2008 and December 4, 2009, were also days that Beaumont saw measurable snowfall. Snow also fell across the Beaumont area on Christmas Eve 2004. In January 1997, a severe and historic ice storm struck the region, leaving thousands without power and major tree damage in its wake. In unofficial records, Beaumont received as much as of snow during the blizzard of February 1895 that impacted the Gulf Coast.

== Demographics ==

The city of Beaumont and its metropolitan statistical area have experienced slight population decline and stagnation since 2015&#x27;s census estimates, while modest increases in population have assisted in the area&#x27;s demographic sustainment. Similar to its population fluctuations from 1980 to 1990, Beaumont&#x27;s population has shifted from roughly 115,000 to 118,000 residents from the 2020 and 2010 United States census.

=== Religion ===

Religiously, Sperling&#x27;s BestPlaces estimated roughly 78.6% of the population were religious. Christianity, since colonial times, has remained the dominant religion by identification in Beaumont and its surrounding area. Among the Christian community, Baptists were the largest Protestant Christian tradition and spread among numerous denominations; the most notable denominational affiliations among Baptists were the Southern Baptist Convention and National Baptist Convention (USA and America). Roman Catholicism, however, remained the largest single denomination in the city as a result of Spanish colonialism and missionary work, and its increasing Hispanic or Latino population (reflecting nationwide trends); Roman Catholics have been primarily served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Beaumont which is a jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Province of Galveston–Houston.

Beyond Christianity, the second largest religion in the city and metropolitan area has been Islam, with religious Jews comprising the third largest religiously-affiliated demographic in Beaumont; Jewish Beaumonters settled the area in the 19th century, primarily affiliated with Orthodox Judaism. As the area has a substantial Islamic community, interfaith efforts among the dominant religions have occurred, and the Islamic Society of the Triplex completed a 9,000 square foot mosque in 2017.

Citizens of Bevil Oaks presented a petition for detachment to Beaumont ISD on April 20, 2017. The same petition requesting annexation was presented to Hardin-Jefferson ISD on May 1, 2017. Beaumont ISD denied the citizens&#x27; request, where H-J ISD gave their approval. A subsequent appeal was filed by the citizens with the Texas Education Agency on June 23, 2017. An Administrative Law Judge in Austin ruled in December 2017 that the citizens&#x27; request for detachment was legal.

<text>China is a city in Jefferson County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,260 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Beaumont–Port Arthur Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
China was first known as &quot;China Grove&quot;, for a water stop for the Texas and New Orleans Railroad that sat amidst a grove of chinaberry trees. In the 1860s a small community grew around the water stop, and another a few miles away named Nashland. A post office with the name &quot;China&quot; was established there in 1893. When fire destroyed the China Grove depot in 1906, the railroad rebuilt in the larger Nashland area, but retained the established name &quot;China&quot; as the name of the depot. The Nashland post office changed its name to China shortly afterward. It was only in 1971 that the (now-merged) community voted to incorporate as the city of China, Texas.

During World War II, a small branch camp was built for German prisoners of war who were detailed to China from the larger Camp Huntsville in Walker County (now a part of Sam Houston State University). These prisoners helped to maintain rice paddies while local farmers were serving in the military.

The chinaberry trees that gave the community its name are rare in the area today. In fact, two trees that were transplanted to the front lawn of the city&#x27;s civic complex in the mid 1990s are some of the only remaining examples. However, several local China and Meeker natives have taken to cultivating and nurturing new and transplanted chinaberry trees.

In 1999, Walt Disney Home Video celebrated the video release of Mulan in China. They built a miniature version of the Great Wall of China on what used to be Henderson Middle School (now China Elementary School) football field.

For years, China Elementary hosted an annual Chinaberry Festival, to celebrate the city&#x27;s people and history. The festival featured a parade, local country musicians, and many booths fielded by local vendors and church groups. However the elementary school has not hosted the festival since the destruction of Hurricane Rita in 2005. Instead the City of China has attempted somewhat unsuccessfully to reinstate the festival.

In 2004, former Mayor Hermann Edwards pleaded guilty to tampering with governmental records and was sentenced to a year of probation.

==School system==

China is part of the Hardin-Jefferson Independent School District, a school system which spans a large area including China and neighboring cities Nome and Sour Lake, as well as the communities of Meeker, Pinewood, Countrywood, and Greyburg.

Until the 2009–2010 school year began, China was home to two of the district&#x27;s schools, China Elementary (located in the city center across from China&#x27;s city park) and Henderson Middle School (located on the outskirts of town across Highway 90). However, with the opening of the district&#x27;s new high school in neighboring Sour Lake, the old high school campus was repurposed into the new Henderson Middle School, and the old middle school campus was renovated and made the new China Elementary. Portions of the old elementary school were utilized as the city hall for a few years until spring of 2020. the building is still owned by the school district but is not used

China Elementary caters to families from China and Nome. Students attend China Elementary from kindergarten until the fifth grade (and some attend the school&#x27;s pre-kindergarten services).From there, all students move down Highway 326 to Henderson Middle School between Nome and Sour Lake for sixth through eighth grades, and then to the Hardin-Jefferson High School for ninth through twelfth grades.

Both old China Elementary and the old Henderson Middle School used to be part of China School District prior to the consolidation of the local school districts. Before desegregation of schools nationwide in the 1950s, China Elementary (then China School) served white students, whereas Henderson served the African American population.

<text>Groves is a city in Jefferson County, Texas, United States. The population was 17,335 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Beaumont–Port Arthur Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
In 1886, Sam Courville moved his family from a Sabine Lake settlement in Port Arthur to a new home on of land. In that general area around 1911, John Warne Gates purchased additional tracts of land. The land was conveyed to the Griffing brothers of Port Arthur in 1916, and three years later Griffing Brothers Nursery employee Wiley Choate supervised the planting of several thousand pecan trees on a tract. In 1921, the Port Arthur Land Development Company took control of the site and divided the land into a residential subdivision known as &quot;Pecan Grove&quot;. The name was later changed to &quot;Groves&quot;, after development representative and pioneer Port Arthurian Asa Groves.

A post office was established in 1927, a school opened in 1929, and a public library opened in 1930. The community rapidly developed as a stop on the Kansas City Southern Railway. The Atlantic Refinery began operating in 1936. In 1940, a public water system was installed in the community. Several civic organizations, including the Lions Club, Chamber of Commerce, and Volunteer Fire Department, were formed during the 1940s. By the early 1950s, Groves had an estimated population of 1,300. In 1952, Groves voted to incorporate as a city. Rapid population growth followed, surpassing 17,000 in the 1960 census and reaching 18,067 by 1970. During the rest of the 20th century, the population slowly declined. In 2000, Groves was the fourth-largest city in Jefferson County, after Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Nederland.

<text>Nederland ( ) is a city in Jefferson County, Texas, United States. The population was 18,856 at the 2020 census.

The city was settled in 1897 along what became Boston Avenue and was incorporated in 1940. It was settled by Dutch immigrants on land sold by the Kansas City Southern Railway. It is part of the Beaumont–Port Arthur metropolitan area. Nederland is also a part of an area known as &quot;the Golden Triangle&quot;, which comprises Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Orange. The city is adjacent to the Jack Brooks Regional Airport.

== History ==

Nederland was founded in 1897 by Dutch settlers as a repayment for financial services of Dutch bankers who financed the Kansas City Southern railroad line that runs through the center of the city. (&quot;Nederland&quot;, which literally translates to &quot;Lowland&quot;, is the Dutch name for the Netherlands.) The more prominent families were named Rienstra, Doornbos, and Van Oostrom, and their descendants still live in the area today. Tradition says they were attracted to the flat coastal terrain that reminded them of their homeland (although the heat most certainly did not).

Nederland&#x27;s early economy was driven by rice and dairy farming. However, the depression of 1907 and overproduction caused the rice industry in the town to collapse. Many Dutch settlers moved away from the area during this time, but a small percentage remained. After the Spindletop gusher discovery of 1901 and the establishment of the Sun Oil (Now Entergy Transfer) terminal near Nederland, the town became a residential community for the workers of the nearby oil terminals.

Nederland became incorporated as a city in 1940. The surrounding larger cities of Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Orange came to be known as the Golden Triangle. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Port of Port Arthur and the Port of Beaumont were as important as New Orleans, Houston, or Galveston, and Nederland thrived as a result.

The refineries also attracted a large population of blue-collar laborers into the area. The area drew particularly heavily from southern Louisiana, and a strong Cajun flair is evident throughout the community. With the decline of oil prices in the 1980s, the local economy suffered and Nederland experienced slight population losses, but has stabilized in the late 1990s and 2000s.

Nederland is the ending location of the Keystone Pipeline.

==Geography==

On September 13, 2007, Nederland was hit by Hurricane Humberto, a category 1 hurricane. The eye of the hurricane passed over the city.

On September 13, 2008, Nederland was hit by hurricane-force winds of Hurricane Ike, a category 2 hurricane that came ashore at Galveston and pushed an storm surge ahead of it. The Golden Triangle area of Nederland, Port Arthur, Port Neches and Beaumont were spared from the surge by the sea wall that surrounds Port Arthur. Bridge City, Orange and the outlying areas were severely flooded.

<doc id="136203" wikidata="Q431631" url="?curid=136203" title="Port Neches, Texas">
<text>Port Neches is a city in Jefferson County, Texas, United States. The population was 13,692 at the 2020 census, an increase over the figure of 13,040 tabulated in 2010. It is part of the Beaumont–Port Arthur metropolitan area.

== History ==
The area known as Port Neches was once inhabited by tribes of the coastal-dwelling Karankawa and Atakapa Native Americans. Smith&#x27;s Bluff (the future site of Sun Oil and Union Oil of California riverside property) and Grigsby&#x27;s Bluff (now Port Neches) were the only two high land bluffs on the Neches River south of Beaumont, whose name is believed to have been derived from the Caddo word &quot;Nachawi&quot;, meaning &quot;wood of the bow&quot;, after Spanish settlers called it &quot;Río Neches&quot;. Before 1780, Grigsby&#x27;s Bluff, specifically that part of Port Neches immediately east of Port Neches Park, had been a Native American town for at least 1,500 years, at first of the Karankawa tribe, whose skeletons were often found in the burial mounds there; and after 1650 of the Nacazils, a sub-tribe of the Attakapas, who were a short and stocky people before their extinction about 1780. As of 1841, there were six large burial mounds at Grigsby&#x27;s Bluff, size about wide, tall, and long, consisting entirely of clam and sea shells, skeletons, pottery shards, and other Native American artifacts. Between 1841 and 1901, all six of the mounds disappeared, a result of human actions. Grigsby&#x27;s Bluff became a post office in 1859 (there was also a store and sawmill there), but the office was discontinued in 1893.

Port Neches was the site of Fort Grigsby, a set of Civil War-era defenses intended to stop a Union advance up the Neches River. The fort was constructed in October 1862 and abandoned sometime after July 1863. Its guns, munitions, and stores were moved to the then-unfinished Fort Griffin, the site of the Second Battle of Sabine Pass, often credited as the most one-sided Confederate victory of the American Civil War.

A pioneer of Port Neches was Will Block Sr., born on August 2, 1870. In 2003, his son, W. T. Block Jr., was appointed a Knight of the Royal Order of Orange-Nassau for his work in reconstructing the history of Dutch settlers in the area.

The city of Port Neches was incorporated in April 1927.

The greater Neches River Basin is an attraction for fishing, hunting, birding, and boating.

TPC Group&#x27;s Port Arthur Refinery, a chemical processing facility, was opened in 1944 by Neches Butane Products Co. On November 27, 2019, two explosions occurred at the plant injuring at least eight people, three of them plant workers who were treated in hospital. Several buildings, including homes, were damaged in Port Neches and the surrounding area. The blasts started a chemical fire that prompted a mandatory evacuation of approximately 60,000 residents from several nearby cities. The fire was finally put out on December 3 after burning for six days. The next day air monitors posted elevated levels of butadiene, prompting a second evacuation. The explosions occurred just days after the U.S. EPA eased chemical plant safety regulations.

Most of the city is served by the Port Neches–Groves Independent School District. Parts of the city fall within the Nederland Independent School District.

The Effie &amp; Wilton Hebert Public Library is the community library. It was named after Wilton Hebert, who sponsored the construction of the current library. It originated with a bookmobile service established in 1930 managed by the Tyrell Public Library of Beaumont, as the Jefferson County Commissioner&#x27;s Court had requested a library for people outside of Beaumont and Port Arthur the previous year. The Jefferson County Library System established a one-room library facility between 1932 and 1934, sponsored by the Lion&#x27;s Club. In 1966 the George Boyd Memorial Library, named after Port Neches city employee George Travis Boyd, opened; the Port Neches city council approved of its construction in 1964. It had a cost of $75,000 with $10,000 from the municipal government. It was across from the Port Neches city hall. The current library building had its groundbreaking on Thursday, October 15, 1981, and opened on November 12, 1982.

== Controversy ==
The Port Neches-Groves Independent School District has a long history involving its continued use of their mascot, the Indians, despite years of controversy and calls of racism. Their drill team performs wearing decorative war bonnets. Their chants include the words &quot;Scalp &#x27;em, Indians&quot;, their yearbook is the &quot;War Whoop&quot;, their newspaper is called &quot;The Pow Wow news&quot; and their stadium is called &quot;The Reservation.&quot;

In 2020, the Cherokee Nation requested that the school stop using their mascot, rescinding an outdated approval given to the school from 1980. Despite a nearly 150,000 signature petition requesting the name change, along with the request of the Cherokee Nation, the town voted to keep the mascot.

In 2022, the Indianettes were filmed performing at Walt Disney World. According to Disney, when the school sent their audition video for approval, the Indianettes were not included and the school was instructed that their members could not wear their war bonnets during the performance. Their inclusion was not approved by Disney and was a decision made by the school. During the performance at the park, the team shouted chants of &quot;Scalp &#x27;em&quot; and enacted simulated war dances. The school has not issued a statement though many residents have defended their actions and stand by their refusal to change.

After the performance, Cherokee Nation&#x27;s Principal Chief, Chuck Hoskin Jr, released a statement once again requesting that the school remove the mascot stating: &quot;Port Neches-Groves Independent School District continues to use offensive and stereotypical depictions of our tribe, and this is yet again exampled by their cheer team recently in Orlando. For the past couple of years, we have written to the Port Neches superintendent and school board asking them to cease using this offensive imagery, chanting, symbolism and other practices in their school traditions as this does nothing but dishonor us and all Native American tribes who are making great strides in this country. School leaders need educating on cultural appropriateness, should apologize for continuing to ignore our requests to stop and need to make swift changes to correct these offensive displays across their school district.&quot;

==Origin==
Hebbronville is located on land which once formed part of Las Noriecitas, one of the earliest ranches founded in the area.

The town&#x27;s namesake, James Richard Hebbron, acquired land, &quot;circa&quot; 1880, from the descendants of the original grantee, Ignacio Benavides. With two others, he bought , in what was then Duval County, just above Peña. One of his sons, Arthur Hebbron, came down from California and took charge of running his ranch.

Hebbronville itself was created in 1883, when the Texas-Mexican Railway Company built a railroad through the area. Francisco P. Peña, operator of Peña Station on this route, refused to sell any land to the Texas-Mexican for a townsite. The company then approached J. R. Hebbron, who arranged for the sale of land for the new townsite, near Peñitas. The old train station at Peñitas was then loaded onto a flatcar, moved 1½ miles west and named Hebbronville.

For a time, Hebbronville ranked as the largest cattle-shipping center in the country, and it continues to be a hub of ranching activity.

A photograph of James R. Hebbron hangs in the Jim Hogg County Courthouse at 102 East Tilley Street in Hebbronville. He was born in 1828, in London, England, but spent most of his adult life in California, mainly around Salinas, dying there in 1926.

<text>Alice is a city in, and the county seat of, Jim Wells County, Texas, United States, in the South Texas region of the state. The population was 19,104 at the 2010 census. Alice was established in 1888. First it was called &quot;Bandana&quot;, then &quot;Kleberg&quot;, and finally &quot;Alice&quot; after Alice Gertrudis King Kleberg, the daughter of Richard King, who established the King Ranch.

==History==

Alice originated from the defunct community of Collins, to the east. c. 1880, the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway attempted to build a line through Collins, which then had approximately 2,000 inhabitants. The townspeople were not amenable to selling their land to the railroad company; consequently, the railroad site was moved 3 miles west, and in 1883, a depot called &quot;Bandana&quot; was established at its junction with the Corpus Christi, San Diego and Rio Grande Railway. Bandana soon became a thriving cattle-shipping point, and an application for a post office was made under the name &quot;Kleberg&quot; in honor of Robert Justus Kleberg, a veteran of the Battle of San Jacinto. The petition was denied because a town named Kleberg already appeared on the post office list, so residents then chose the name &quot;Alice&quot;, in honor of Alice Gertrudis King Kleberg, Robert Justus Kleberg Jr.’s wife and the daughter of Richard and Henrietta King. The Alice post office opened for business in 1888. Within a few years, the remaining residents of Collins moved to Alice, which was by then a thriving community.

Alice was known for its large cattle industry until the discovery of petroleum beneath and around the town in the 1940s, which caused a slight population boom.

In the 1948 United States Senate election in Texas, an incident (Box 13 scandal) involving Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s bid for the U.S. Senate took place at Alice&#x27;s Precinct 13, where 202 ballots were cast in alphabetical order and all just at the close of polling in favor of Johnson. Johnson won the election against Coke Stevenson by 87 votes.

==Culture==
Alice has long been recognized as the &quot;Birthplace of Tejano Music&quot;, dating back to the mid-1940s, when Armando Marroquin Sr., of Alice and partner Paco Betancourt of San Benito launched what was to be the first home-based recording company to record Tejano artists exclusively. Ideal Records, which was based in Alice, under the direction of Marroquin became the perfect vehicle for Tejano groups and artists to get their music to the public. Marroquin, who also owned and operated a jukebox company, ensured that Ideal recordings would be distributed throughout South Texas. The songs recorded, which were contributed by Tejano and Mexican composers, became very popular through jukeboxes placed in restaurants, cantinas, or other establishments that would have them, and the then-scarce Spanish-language radio programs. In addition to Ideal, Alice was the home of Freddie Records and Hacienda Records, which were dominant players in Tejano music in the 1970s and 1980s.

Alice is the birthplace of two Nobel Prize winners. Robert F. Curl Jr. was honored with a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1996, and James P. Allison won a Nobel for his work in medicine in 2018.

==Outdoor activities==
Alice and its surrounding areas have an abundance of wildlife, so hunting, fishing, and bird watching are favorite activities, and wild game hunting leases are available through Texas Parks and Wildlife. Golfers have two courses from which to choose in the Hub City, with the Alice Municipal Golf Course being the larger with 18 holes, long fairways, and water hazards. The other is the nine-hole Alice Country Club golf course, east of town.

==N.A.L.F. Orange Grove==
The BRAC decision to close Naval Air Station Chase Field near Beeville led to an increase in Pilot Training Rate (PTR) and the physical number of aircraft stationed at NAS Kingsville in Kleberg County. Currently , 70 T-45 trainer aircraft have arrived. In recognition of the increased congestion at Kingsville, the Navy made a significant investment in improving the facilities and capabilities of the Auxiliary Landing Field (ALF) at Orange Grove, about southwest of town. The terminal airspace at Kingsville was expanded to include Orange Grove, and the ALF serves as an overflow relief from the primary airfield.

Hunting and fishing at NALF Orange Grove and Escondido Ranch is authorized in accordance with station directives and state and federal laws. Naval Air Station (NAS) Located in Kingsville, NAS Kingsville decided to play seasonal host to the burrowing owl. The South Texas Naval air station, in a partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey&#x27;s Texas Gulf Coast Field Research Station, the Coastal Bend Bays &amp; Estuaries Program, Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi and the Coastal Bend Ambassadors, will offer an open field with artificial burrows for the burrowing owls, which are anticipated to stay there over the winter, beginning in October. The Naval Auxiliary Landing Field (NALF) in Orange Grove also will have artificial burrows. NAS Kingsville has 18 artificial burrows, as does NALF Orange Grove. The burrows are organized in three groups of six sets, with each group being approximately apart.

<text>Premont is a city in Jim Wells County, Texas, United States. The population was 2,455 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==

Premont is located at (27.358064, –98.125766). It is situated at along U.S. Highway 281 (Future Interstate 69C) in south central Jim Wells County, south of Alice and north of Falfurrias, two towns that Morgan Smith of the &quot;Texas Tribune&quot; refers to as &quot;relative hubs&quot;.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Premont has a total area of , all land.

==History==
The site was part of the Los Olmos y Loma Blanca land grant issues to Ignacio de la Peña on December 9, 1831. Peña and his heirs occupied the land for the next thirty years. On November 1, 1907, banker and real estate developer R.P. Halderman purchased a plot of land from the heirs of Henry Seeligson for $540,939.50. He then subdivided the land into tracts to entice residents from the northern U.S. to invest in South Texas, citing the region&#x27;s warm climate and ideal planting conditions.

In 1908 or 1909, a town site was surveyed by C.F.H. Von Bulcher. Halderman named the new community &quot;Premont&quot;, after Seeligson Ranch foreman Charles Premont. A section of the community, located east of the railroad, was set aside for Mexican and Mexican-American families. A plaza called Hidalgo Park was designed and built to serve those families. R.P. Halderman sold hundreds of lots to Charles Premont, who in turn served as the real estate agent for the Mexican families, as he was fluent in Spanish. He also donated the funds to build Santa Theresa Catholic Church, a Roman Catholic institution that now ministers to three missions. Several businesses, including a post office and a general store owned by Andrés Canales, opened in the community during its early years. Premont became part of the newly organized Jim Wells County on March 11, 1911. In an election held on May 6, 1911, Charles Premont was elected as the county&#x27;s first commissioner. By 1912, Premont had ten businesses and an estimated population of 800. That figure had risen to approximately 1,000 by 1914, the same year that the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway built a stop at Premont. The Premont Independent School District was created in 1921. At the time of its creation, Premont ISD was the largest school district in Jim Wells County. Premont&#x27;s population had declined to roughly 600 by 1925.

The discovery of oil in the area during the early 1930s caused the community to grow substantially. On May 12, 1933, Premont&#x27;s first producing oil well was drilled. The community incorporated in 1939 and had a population of 1,080 in 1940. With its revitalized and oil-based economy, Premont continued to grow and prosper during the early post-war years. The town was home to 2,619 residents in 1950 and had a total of 55 businesses in 1952. In 1955, American Legion Post No. 297 was dedicated in Premont. The population peaked at 3,282 in the 1970 census and has slowly declined since.

<doc id="136222" wikidata="Q534957" url="?curid=136222" title="Cleburne, Texas">
<text>Cleburne ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Johnson County, Texas, United States. As of the 2020 census, its population was 31,352. The city is named in honor of Patrick Cleburne, a Confederate general. Lake Pat Cleburne, the reservoir that provides water to the city and surrounding area, is also named after him.

== History ==

Cleburne is Johnson County&#x27;s third county seat (the first being Wardville, now under Lake Pat Cleburne). It was formerly known as Camp Henderson, a temporary Civil War outpost from which Johnson County soldiers would depart for war (most of them served under General Cleburne). The city was formally incorporated in 1871.

Cleburne was near the earliest road in the county. The location featured water from West Buffalo Creek, making it a stop for cattlemen from the Chisholm Trail.

In August 1886, the Texas Farmers&#x27; Alliance met at Lee&#x27;s Academy and adopted a 17-point political resolution, commonly known as the Cleburne Demands, which was the first major document of the agrarian revolt occurring at the end of the late 19th century.

In 1900, Cleburne was the site of the founding convention of the Texas State Federation of Labor.

Cleburne was primarily an agricultural center and county seat until the Santa Fe Railroad opened a major facility there in 1898. During this time, the population boomed, as it became a sizable city for the area with over 12,000 residents by 1920. The Chicago, Texas and Mexican Central Railway connected Cleburne to Dallas in 1882. Two other railroads had terminals in Cleburne. The Dallas, Cleburne, and Southwestern Railway completed a route to Egan in 1902, and the Trinity and Brazos Valley, nicknamed the Boll Weevil, operated from Cleburne from 1904 to 1924.

Cleburne was the site of a prisoner-of-war camp for German soldiers during World War 2. The POWs worked as laborers on local farms.

In 1985, the city was the petitioner in the U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.&quot; after being sued over a special-use permit.

Cleburne is on the fringe of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Growth in the area has been primarily attributed to suburbanization.

On May 15, 2013, Cleburne was hit by a powerful tornado that cut a mile-wide path through part of the city and damaged about 600 homes and two schools. The National Weather Service rated it EF-3, which has winds between . No deaths or severe injuries were reported.

State Highways 171 and 174 run through the center of Cleburne on Main Street.

<text>Joshua is a city in Johnson County, Texas, United States. The population was at the 2020 census.

==History==
Joshua is in the Cross Timbers region of Texas, on land patented by W. W. Byers in 1867. The section was sold in 1874 to John Powell. Caddo Grove, east of Joshua, was the first community in the area. It had its own post office and was a thriving town until the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway was completed from Cleburne to Fort Worth in 1881. The railroad missed Caddo Grove, and a station was built on the tracks at the site of future Joshua. The station was originally called &quot;Caddo Peak&quot;, but the name was rejected by the post office because of another community with that name. The name &quot;Joshua&quot; was chosen, purportedly by Dr. D. B. McMillan, after the biblical Joshua. W. L. West was the first postmaster when the community received a post office in 1882. In 1883, Caddo Grove&#x27;s post office was withdrawn.

The plat for Joshua was first surveyed in 1880, and the community was organized in 1881 when the railroad arrived. The first store, opened in 1882 by W. L. West, also housed the post office. By 1890, Joshua had a population of 300, two steam-powered corn mills and cotton gins, a hotel, a general store, and a newspaper, the &quot;Johnson County Record&quot;. The railroad shipped farm produce, Joshua&#x27;s largest export. The first one-room school opened in 1890, and in 1899, it moved into a new building. In 1917, this school became Joshua High School. In 1900 and 1912, Joshua suffered major fires. In spite of this, new businesses continued to open. The Citizen&#x27;s Banking Company, opened in 1904, was run by J. W. Spencer. Two years later, a public water system began. Truck gardens, orchards, and corn and cotton farms surrounded Joshua.

In 1912, the Fort Worth South Traction Line began to provide interurban rail service from Cleburne to Fort Worth, with a stop in Joshua. Service stopped in 1932 because of the growing importance of automobile travel. The first car in Joshua was purchased in 1913. By 1914, the community had a population of 824, two cotton gins, an ice plant, a bank, a newspaper named the &quot;Joshua Star&quot;, and four churches. Local farms grew cotton and potatoes.

Rhodes at his Star Hotel in Anson in 1885 and annually thereafter until 1890, when the hotel burned down. The event happened sporadically until it faded away during Prohibition. Teacher and folklorist Leonora Barrett revived the event in 1940. The dance was (and still is) held in Pioneer Hall, a Works Progress Administration project from the Great Depression. Music is usually provided by Michael Martin Murphey and his band.

Anson also may or may not have been the inspiration for the movie &quot;Footloose&quot; and, as of 1987, still had an enforced &quot;no dancing&quot; law on the books that is/was only lifted for the annual Christmas dance. An effort was made in 1987 to change the ordinance to allow supervised dancing, which was successful. The conflict was the basis for the book, &quot;No Dancin&#x27; In Anson: An American Story of Race and Social Change&quot;, by University of Texas professor Ricardo Ainslie.

==Education==
The city is served by the Anson Independent School District and is home to the Anson High School Tigers.

When he investigated the aftermath, the Lamberts had somehow miraculously survived their home&#x27;s destruction after taking a direct hit from the tornado, but were seriously injured.

<text>Karnes City is a city in and county seat of Karnes County, Texas, United States. The population was 3,111 at the 2020 census, up from 3,042 at the 2010 census. The town was named after Henry Karnes of the Texas Revolution. Karnes is southeast of Floresville and southeast of San Antonio on U.S. Highway 181.

== History ==
In 1894, as a result of a special election, the county seat was moved from Helena to Karnes City. Ten years earlier, Colonel William G. Butler (1831–1912) had blamed Helena and its corrupt mayor for the death of his son, Emmett, who was killed on December 26, 1884, by a stray bullet from a bar fight. Butler, a wealthy rancher, retaliated by arranging for the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway, which started construction in 1885, to bypass Helena.

The railway started operation in 1886. By 1890, with no rail line, Helena was at a disadvantage for serving the county&#x27;s needs. In 1890, a group of businessmen purchased land on the rail line, southwest of Helena, with the specific intent of building a new town to serve as the county seat. The new town, named for Colonel Henry Wax Karnes (1812–1840), veteran of the Texas Revolution and a leader of the Texas Rangers, was a viable settlement by 1894, when the county voted to move its seat from Helena. Karnes City continued to grow, while Helena faded into a ghost town.

The story was fictionalized in the 1969 episode &quot;The Oldest Law&quot; of the television series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;. In the episode, Jim Davis played the role of Colonel Butler, while Stacy Harris played Helena&#x27;s mayor.
