<text>Baldwin is a town in Chemung County, New York, United States. The population was 818 at the 2020 census. The town name is derived from Thomas and Waterman Baldwin, two of the earliest settlers of the area. The town is east of Elmira. It is part of the Elmira Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
===Early settlement===
While it is most likely that hunters and trappers passed through the area in earlier years, Baldwin was first settled around 1813, credit given to Charles and Warren Granger as being the first white settlers to the area. The brothers put down roots on what was first called &quot;Hammond Corners&quot; and would later become North Chemung. The trek to their new home would have been difficult, due in part to thick virgin forest and ravines as well as swampland thick with underbrush.

Soon after the Granger brothers, Henry Tice came to Hammond Corners with his family from Ulster County in downstate New York in 1815. Also in 1815 came Jason Hammond with his five sons, Elisha, James, Robert, David and Cornelius. In the years that followed many more families came from New England, including Peter McCumber for whom the area known as &quot;McCumber Corners&quot; is named. Other families were the Whitakers, Collisions, Browns, Elstons, Drakes and many more. Many of these families still reside in the township or have close ties.

The first church society was organized in 1818 with worship services being held in various citizens&#x27; homes. It wasn&#x27;t until 1852 that a church was built to serve all different faiths of the community. This church is the one that is still in use in North Chemung known as the United Methodist Church. In 1910 a church was built in Hicks and it too continues to be used.

The first school in Baldwin was started in 1819 with the children taught by John Tuthill Jr in a cabin owned by John Brooks. The first schoolhouse was built in 1821 at the corner of the North Chemung Cemetery. In 1869 a new schoolhouse was built across the road and is still standing. It has been a store, a private home and now belongs to the United Methodist Church primarily used to house the local food pantry.

===Early firsts===
*First child born - Simeon Hammond in 1815
*First death - Thomas Weaver (killed by a falling log) in 1820
*First wedding - Nicholas Patterson to Anna Tice in 1818
*First local physician - Doctor J.W. Moore in 1836
*First mail service - In 1843, Anthony Collision, Postmaster

===History as a town===
The town of Baldwin was founded by an act of the state legislature on April 7, 1856, from part of the town of Chemung. The first town meeting was held May 6, 1856, at the house of Daniel R. Harris, innkeeper. William H. Little was elected Town Supervisor, Johnson Little as Town Clerk, Daniel R. Harris as Commissioner of the Highways, and William R. Drake, William and Jeremiah McCumber as Justices of the Peace.

In 1856 Baldwin was a small village; the 1860 census shows a population of 274. There were several shops and businesses that were closely linked to the agricultural makeup of the town. There were also sawmills and lumber not used locally was floated down Baldwin Creek, which runs through the town, and on to Elmira to be sold.

Social life was very localized, but for holidays and special occasions there would have been community-wide square dances filled with fun and music. In the early years of the town medicine shows and peddlers&#x27; arrivals would have been other exciting events for the people living there.

In 1875 there were 1,006 people living in Baldwin. However, with the rise of the Industrial Age there was less demand for handcrafted goods produced locally. With the completion of several railroad lines in Elmira more people began leaving Baldwin to make a living working in the factories in Elmira and beyond. By 1911 the town&#x27;s population was down to 476.

On May 22, 1923, one hundred citizens of the town petitioned the supervisors of the county to have the town of Baldwin dissolved. The reason they gave was that the tax rates were excessive for citizens because of the lack of businesses in the township. It was proposed that the town be parcelled off and incorporated into the neighboring towns of Erin and Chemung. However, the petition was denied by the county, as once a boundary is laid down on the official maps it would take too much legal formality to change, and a unanimous demand would be required to do so.

In 1956 the town celebrated its 100th anniversary with a parade, dance and other fun. The town celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2006 much in the same fashion, with many local and state dignitaries in attendance.

The census in 2010 listed the total population of Baldwin at 832. Farming continues to be a way of life for some in the town to this day, but to a much lesser extent. The past 20 years have seen many family farms, specifically dairies, close down operations as the cost of farming outweighs the income. Until recently there was an increased interest in natural gas drilling within the town and region until a state moratorium was made permanent by Governor Andrew Cuomo. Short of a few small home-based businesses, the majority of Baldwin&#x27;s residents are employed in Elmira and the surrounding communities.

Life in the 21st century places demands on the citizens that take them outside the town&#x27;s borders for both work and play. Still there is much history in this sleepy community, and the traces of yesterday are still to be found. In fact many of the older roads used in days gone by are now little more than cleared paths through the woods between existing roads for hikers to roam. There is evidence along the banks of Baldwin Creek remaining from the days of lumber mills that once occupied its shores, and many of the home buildings still stand, some still occupied by the descendants of those who built them.

==Geography==
The town of Baldwin lies in the southeastern section of Chemung County. It is the second to smallest town in the county and is bounded on the north by the towns of Erin and Van Etten, to the east by Barton in Tioga County, to the south and east by Chemung, and to the west by Elmira. The main areas of population are the hamlets of North Chemung and Hicks. Hicks is located in the extreme northeastern area of the town, and North Chemung is more to the center.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which , or 0.08%, is water. Most of the town&#x27;s land drains to the Chemung River, a tributary of the Susquehanna River. Baldwin Creek drains the center and northwestern parts of the town, Wynkoop Creek drains the northeastern part around Hicks, and smaller creeks drain the southern part of the town to the Chemung River. The far eastern end of the town drains to Cayuta Creek, a direct tributary of the Susquehanna.

Laying on flat land between high hills, North Chemung is exceedingly sensitive to climatic changes and at one time was known as &quot;The Icebox of Chemung County&quot; for its winter temperatures being much colder than elsewhere in Chemung County.

<text>Chemung is a town in Chemung County, New York, United States. The population was 2,368 at the 2020 census. The town name is derived from the Chemung River, which means &quot;big horn&quot; in the Seneca language.

The town is in the southeast corner of the county and is southeast of Elmira. It is part of the Elmira Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
The region was destroyed by the Sullivan Expedition on August 13, 1779, which fought at the Battle of Newtown, just west of the current town of Chemung.

The first clear record of settlement dates to about 1786.

The town of Chemung was established in 1788 as the original town in the region. Chemung lost territory when Tioga County was formed in 1791. The town of Newtown (now the town of Elmira) was taken from Chemung in 1792. Chemung was incorporated in 1788 into Montgomery County, at the time of that town&#x27;s formation. (Chemung County was not created until 1836.) Subsequently, the town of Chemung lost more territory to form all or parts of Erin (1822), Baldwin (1856), and Ashland (1867).

The Chemung District School No. 10, Dr. Hovey Everett House, and Riverside Cemetery are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

== Fire protection ==
===Fire department history===
The Elmira Heights Volunteer Fire Department was founded in 1896. When it began it was composed of two companies, the Chemical and Hose Company and the Independent Hook and Ladder Company. These later combined into one department. The first fire chief was William Monroe, and the first fire bell was purchased from Grace Church in Elmira. The original fire station was across the street from its present location on the northeast corner of Scottwood and Fourteenth Street. It was merely a shed in which to store equipment. Throughout the Heights three hose carts were placed. In case of a fire, this was the procedure used: Someone ran to ring the fire bell while everyone else near the fire ran to the hose cart to fasten the hose to the nearest hydrant. When the fire bell rang, firemen from every part of the village raced to the fire station. The hook and ladder truck was hand-drawn. The hose carts and chemical engine were horse-drawn.

Anyone with a team of horses made a bee-line for the station. The first team that appeared to pull the apparatus received three dollars for his services and the second team received two dollars for the use of his team. The race to see what man would get his team to the fire station first was almost as exciting as the fire itself. At the fire, the hose was connected to the hose already connect to the hydrant and the real fire fighting began.

The fire department had its social side as well. The two companies were as separate as it was possible to be. You either belonged to one or the other, but never both. You might walk to the door of the building with your friend of the other company, but once inside the door friendship ceased until you came back out. Benefit dances, card parties, and social gatherings were held and things went fine until it was time to divide the money. This rivalry and animosity continued until one night a new fire chief, tired of the bickering, ordered the door to be opened between the parlors of the two companies.

===Fire department today===
Today the Elmira Heights Fire Department is located next door to the Elmira Heights Village Hall. Although the roster remains all-volunteer, the Village funds a 24/365 &quot;Paid First Responder&quot; program. There is a qualified duty responder within the station at all times, ready to respond to alarms. The department continues to offer Fire, Rescue and EMS services to the village of Elmira Heights and the towns of Elmira and Horseheads.

=== Elmira Heights Fire Company #1 ===
The membership of the Elmira Heights Fire Department is made up of the Elmira Heights Fire Company. This is a private, not for profit social entity that supports the department from within the all-volunteer roster. They are housed within the department and operate as volunteer employees of the department during alarms. The department is responsible for day-to-day operations, apparatus maintenance, training &amp; education, alarm response, etc. Whereas the company manages all fund raising efforts and social engagements. The Elmira Heights Fire Company solely funds the department EMS program.

=== Can and bottle drive ===
In 2011, the Elmira Heights Fire Company began a program encouraging the local public to donate their empty deposit cans and bottles. With the assistance of a local recycling company and a few dedicated members, the company has been able to collaborate with the village board to rehab their heavy rescue apparatus. They have since also donated two more apparatus to the village. One being a quick response EMS apparatus and also a wild land &quot;brush&quot; suppression vehicle. Due to an overwhelming response from the public, this program continues to fund EMS and other operations that may otherwise not continue without an additional tax levy on the residents.

===Former fire apparatus manufacturer===
Elmira Heights was once the location of the Ward LaFrance Truck Corporation&#x27;s manufacturing facility.

== Police services ==
The Elmira Heights Police Department is a small full-service agency consisting of a force of eleven men which offers 24/7 police protection to the village of Elmira Heights. The department investigates all offenses that take place within the boundaries of the village. The Police Department shares their operations facility with the Elmira Heights Fire Department.

<text>The Quarrymen (also written as &quot;the Quarry Men&quot;) are a British skiffle and rock and roll group, formed by John Lennon in Liverpool in 1956, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Originally consisting of Lennon and several school friends, the Quarrymen took their name from a line in the school song of their school, the Quarry Bank High School. Lennon&#x27;s mother, Julia, taught her son to play the banjo, showed Lennon and Eric Griffiths how to tune their guitars in a similar way to the banjo, and taught them simple chords and songs.

Lennon founded a skiffle group with his close friend Pete Shotton and after a week of gaining new members, they named themselves The Quarrymen. The Quarrymen played at parties, school dances, cinemas and amateur skiffle contests before Paul McCartney joined in early July, 1957. George Harrison joined in early 1958 at McCartney&#x27;s recommendation, though Lennon initially resisted because he felt Harrison (14 when he was introduced to Lennon) was too young. McCartney and Harrison attended the Liverpool Institute.

The group made an amateur recording in 1958, performing Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; and &quot;In Spite of All the Danger&quot;, a song written by McCartney and Harrison. The group moved towards rock and roll, causing several of the original members to leave. This left Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison, who performed under several other names, including Johnny and the Moondogs, Japage 3, and Long John and the Silver Beatles before returning to the Quarrymen name in 1959. In 1960, the group changed their name to &quot;The Beatles&quot; (chosen for its double meaning and as a wink to Buddy Holly&#x27;s band, &quot;The Crickets&quot;). 

In 1997, the four surviving original (non-Beatles) members of the Quarrymen reunited to perform at the 40th anniversary celebrations of the garden fête performance at which Lennon had first met McCartney. Since 1998, they have performed in countries outside the UK and released four albums. Three original members still perform as the Quarrymen.

==History==

===Formation and early performances===
In the mid-1950s, there was a revival in the United Kingdom of the musical form &quot;skiffle&quot; that had originated in the United States and had been popular in the US in the 1920s, &#x27;30s and &#x27;40s. In addition to its popularity among British teenagers as music to listen to, it also spawned a craze of teenage boys starting their own groups to perform the music. One of the primary attractions was that it did not require great musical skills or expensive instruments to be played. Early British skiffle was played by traditional jazz musicians, with the most successful British proponent of the genre in the 1950s being Lonnie Donegan. The Quarrymen&#x27;s initial repertoire included several songs that Donegan had recorded. When Lennon wanted to try making music himself, he and fellow Quarry Bank school friend, Griffiths, took guitar lessons in Hunt&#x27;s Cross, Liverpool, although Lennon gave up the lessons soon after, as they were based on theory and not actual playing.

As Griffiths already knew how to play the banjo, Lennon&#x27;s mother showed them how to tune the top four strings of their guitars to the same notes as a banjo, and taught them the chords of D, C, and D7, as well as the Fats Domino song, &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot;. They practised at Lennon&#x27;s aunt&#x27;s house (called Mendips) at 251 Menlove Avenue where Lennon lived, or at Griffiths&#x27; house in Halewood Drive. They learned how to play Lonnie Donegan&#x27;s &quot;Rock Island Line&quot;, &quot;Jump Down Turn Around (Pick a Bale of Cotton)&quot;, &quot;Alabamy Bound&quot; and &quot;Cumberland Gap&quot;, and later learned how to play two of Elvis Presley&#x27;s first hits, &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; and &quot;Mean Woman Blues&quot;.

Lennon and Griffiths decided to form a skiffle group in November 1956. This initial line-up consisted of Lennon and Griffiths on guitars, Pete Shotton on washboard, and school friend Bill Smith on tea-chest bass. Both Lennon and Shotton have been credited with coining the name Quarrymen after a line in their school&#x27;s song: &#x27;Quarrymen, old before our birth. Straining each muscle and sinew.&#x27; The choice of name was tongue-in-cheek as Lennon regarded the reference in the school song to &quot;straining each muscle and sinew&quot; as risible. Smith&#x27;s tenure in the band was extremely short, and he was replaced in quick succession by Nigel Walley, Ivan Vaughan, and Len Garry throughout late 1956 and early 1957. Also during this period, drummer Colin Hanton and banjo player Rod Davis joined the group. This group of Lennon, Griffiths, Shotton, Garry, Hanton, and Davis formed the first stable line-up of the group.

The group first rehearsed in Shotton&#x27;s house on Vale Road, but because of the noise, his mother told them to use the corrugated air-raid shelter in the back garden. Rehearsals were moved from the cold air-raid shelter to Hanton&#x27;s or Griffiths&#x27; house — as Griffiths&#x27; father had died in WWII, and his mother worked all day. The band also often visited Lennon&#x27;s mother at 1 Blomfield Road, listening to her collection of rock and roll records by Elvis, Shirley and Lee&#x27;s &quot;Let the Good Times Roll&quot;, and Gene Vincent&#x27;s &quot;Be-Bop-A-Lula&quot; which they added to their repertoire. After his tenure on tea-chest bass, Walley became the group&#x27;s manager. He sent flyers to local theatres and ballrooms, and put up posters designed by Lennon: &quot;Country-and-western, rock n&#x27; roll, skiffle band — The Quarrymen — Open for Engagements — Please Call Nigel Walley, Tel. Gateacre 1715&quot;.
Walley managed to secure the group several paid engagements throughout the spring of 1957, including one at The Cavern Club. A jazz club at the time, the Cavern tolerated skiffle as it was considered an offshoot of jazz. Lennon, however, began leading the band in several rock and roll numbers, prompting the club&#x27;s manager to send up a note ordering the group to &quot;cut out the bloody rock&quot;.

In July 1957, Canadian impresario Carroll Levis held a talent contest in Liverpool, the winners of which would appear on the television series &quot;Star Search.&quot; The Quarrymen played Lonnie Donegan&#x27;s &quot;Worried Man Blues&quot;, and were loudly applauded, but a group from Wales (called the Sunnyside Skiffle Group) &quot;jumped all over the stage&quot; and outshone the static Quarrymen, and were asked by Levis to fill in the last few minutes of the contest with a second song. Lennon argued heatedly with Levis backstage, saying the Sunnyside Skiffle Group had brought a bus full of supporters with them, and were given &quot;the upper hand&quot; advantage by Levis. After the competition, Levis used a clap-o-meter (a machine to measure the decibels of the audience&#x27;s reaction to the groups) as they were asked to walk back out onto the stage. The Quarrymen and the Sunnyside Skiffle Group tied by both reaching ninety on the meter, but after a second test, the Quarrymen lost by a small margin.

===Paul McCartney joins the group===
On 6 July 1957, The Quarrymen played at the St. Peter&#x27;s Church &quot;Rose Queen&quot; garden fête in Woolton. They first played on the back of a moving flatbed lorry, in a procession of floats that carried the Rose Queen and retiring Rose Queen, Morris dancers, Boy Scouts, Brownies, Girl Guides and Cubs, led by the Band of the Cheshire Yeomanry. At 4:15, they played on a permanent stage in the field behind the church, before a display by the City of Liverpool Police Dogs. They were playing &quot;Come Go with Me&quot; when Paul McCartney arrived, and in the Scout hut after the set, Ivan Vaughan introduced McCartney to Lennon, who chatted for a few minutes before the band set up in the church hall for their performance at that evening&#x27;s &quot;Grand Dance&quot;. McCartney demonstrated how he tuned his guitar and then sang Eddie Cochran&#x27;s &quot;Twenty Flight Rock&quot;, Gene Vincent&#x27;s &quot;Be-Bop-a-Lula&quot;, and a medley of Little Richard songs.

Vaughan and McCartney left before the evening show which started at 8 o&#x27;clock. During the performance, there was an unexpected thunderstorm, which made the lights go out. Bob Molyneux, a young schoolmate from Quarry Bank, recorded part of the performance on his Grundig TK8 portable reel-to-reel tape recorder. The tape included versions of Lonnie Donegan&#x27;s &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Style&quot; and Elvis&#x27; &quot;Baby Let&#x27;s Play House&quot;. In 1963, Molyneux offered the tape to Lennon via Ringo Starr, but Lennon never responded, so Molyneux put the tape in a vault.

As they were walking home after the evening performance, Lennon and Shotton discussed the afternoon encounter with McCartney, and Lennon said that perhaps they should invite McCartney to join the band. Two weeks later, Shotton encountered McCartney cycling through Woolton, and conveyed Lennon&#x27;s casual invitation for him to join the Quarrymen, and Vaughan also invited McCartney to join. McCartney said he would join after Scout camp in Hathersage, Derbyshire, and a holiday with his family at the Butlin&#x27;s holiday camp in Filey, North Yorkshire. Shotton and Davis both left the Quarrymen in August, feeling that the group was moving away from skiffle and towards rock, leaving their instruments superfluous. When McCartney returned from holiday, he began rehearsing with the Quarrymen, playing songs such as &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; (The Everly Brothers) and &quot;All Shook Up&quot;, which Lennon and the group had been trying to learn, without success.

McCartney made his debut with the band on 18 October 1957 at a Conservative Club social held at the New Clubmoor Hall in the Norris Green section of Liverpool. Lennon and McCartney wore cream-coloured sports jackets, which were paid for by the whole group—Walley collected half a crown per week from each member until they were paid for — and the others wore white shirts with tassels and black bootlace ties. To the irritation of the other group members, McCartney endlessly practised the lead guitar intro to &quot;Raunchy&quot;.
The Quarrymen continued to play sparse gigs throughout the autumn of 1957, mostly for local promoter Charlie McBain. During this period, the group almost entirely excised skiffle from their repertoire, focusing on covers of songs by rock and roll singers such as Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Little Richard, and Larry Williams, and the Quarrymen&#x27;s sound increasingly relied on harmony singing between Lennon and McCartney. An extremely important influence for them at the time was Buddy Holly and his group the Crickets. Around this time, Lennon and McCartney both started writing songs influenced by Holly – Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Hello Little Girl&quot; and McCartney&#x27;s &quot;I Lost My Little Girl&quot; – and both were impressed with each other&#x27;s efforts. The two young men began writing together.

===George Harrison&#x27;s entry and recording===

After McCartney&#x27;s poor performance on lead guitar at the Conservative Club, the group needed another guitarist to accommodate their new rock-focused repertoire; McCartney recommended his school friend George Harrison. Harrison first saw the group perform on 6 February 1958 at Wilson Hall, where McCartney introduced him to Lennon. Harrison subsequently auditioned for The Quarrymen in March at Rory Storm&#x27;s Morgue Skiffle Club, playing &quot;Guitar Boogie Shuffle&quot;. Lennon thought Harrison (having just turned 15) was too young to join the band, so McCartney engineered another meeting on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, where Harrison played &quot;Raunchy&quot; for Lennon. After McCartney&#x27;s constant advocacy, Lennon allowed Harrison to join the Quarrymen as lead guitarist. Harrison&#x27;s entry into the Quarrymen shifted the group even more away from skiffle, in addition to ending Lennon&#x27;s use of banjo chords. Around this time, John Duff Lowe, another school friend of McCartney, joined the group on piano.

With Harrison&#x27;s entry, the Quarrymen now had four guitarists. Lennon and McCartney suggested to Griffiths that he instead buy a bass guitar, but Griffiths refused because of the expense. The two subsequently convinced Nigel Walley, still acting as the group&#x27;s manager, to fire Griffiths. Walley regretted the incident, and as a result gradually severed his ties with the Quarrymen. Around this same time, Len Garry contracted tubercular meningitis, and spent seven months in the hospital, never playing with the group again. This left Colin Hanton as the last of the group of Lennon&#x27;s Quarry Bank classmates that originally comprised the group. In March, McCartney bought an Elpico amplifier with two inputs, and he and Harrison added pickups to their guitars, giving the Quarrymen an electric sound for the first time.
Percy Phillips operated a studio called Phillips&#x27; Sound Recording Services at 38 Kensington, Liverpool, between the kitchen and a front room that served as an electrical goods shop. Actors from the Liverpool Playhouse often stayed in the room above the studio, and were asked by Phillips to record monologues and poems. Phillips had just turned 60 years old when Harrison heard about the studio from guitarist Johnny Byrne of the Raving Texans, who had recorded a version of &quot;Butterfly&quot; there on 22 June 1957. The Quarrymen booked a recording session on 12 July 1958. They recorded straight to disc, as tape would have been an extra expense. The sound was recorded live by a single microphone in the centre of the room, and Lennon suggested that Hanton put a scarf over the snare drum to lower the volume. They first recorded &quot;In Spite of All the Danger&quot; a McCartney original (credited as McCartney/Harrison) followed by Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot;. Both feature Lennon on lead vocals. When the recording was finished, Phillips handed the group a fragile 78rpm record, which was passed around the band for one week each, or lent out to friends. It was later lost until Lowe rediscovered it in 1981, and sold it to McCartney for an undisclosed amount. The recordings would later be issued on the Beatles&#x27; album &quot;Anthology 1&quot;.

===&quot;The rhythm&#x27;s in the guitars&quot;===

Soon after the recording session, Hanton had a fight with the rest of the group and quit. Lowe too lost contact with the group after leaving Liverpool Institute, leaving the Quarrymen as just a trio of guitarists: Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. Lennon&#x27;s mother was killed in a road accident on 15 July 1958, dealing him a devastating emotional blow. The group remained mostly inactive throughout the summer, as Lennon took up a job in a restaurant at the Liverpool Airport. McCartney and Harrison, meanwhile, went on holiday hitchhiking in Wales, playing with a local skiffle group called The Vikings. Although Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison remained extremely close, the trio only performed a handful of times in the last months of 1958. When asked why they had neither a drummer or a bass player, they would respond &quot;The rhythm&#x27;s in the guitars.&quot;

In the fall of 1958, the group had another chance to audition for Carroll Levis, nearly a year and a half after the Quarrymen&#x27;s first &quot;Star Search&quot;. For the audition, the group changed their name to Johnny and the Moondogs. Lennon was without a guitar, his having broken recently. Johnny and the Moondogs passed the first heat of the competition in Liverpool, and were invited to appear in the finals in Manchester. The group performed Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;Think It Over&quot; to positive reception, but were unable to stay until the end of the competition to receive the results. As they were leaving, Lennon saw a cutaway electric guitar by the stage door, picked it up and walked off with it, later saying that the trip &quot;wasn&#x27;t a total loss.&quot;

Following their &quot;Star Search&quot; audition, Johnny and the Moondogs changed their name to Japage 3 (pronounced &quot;Jaypage&quot;) (combining letters from each of the member&#x27;s names: John, Paul, and George). Lennon had a friend from art school, named Derek Hodkin, who owned a tape recorder, and Lennon convinced him to record the group (along with McCartney&#x27;s brother Mike on drums). The group then asked Hodkin to act as their manager, and he agreed. Despite Hodkin&#x27;s management, bookings for the group dried up. Harrison began a stint as rhythm guitarist in the Les Stewart Quartet, who had a weekly club engagement. By May, Japage 3 was defunct, although the three continued to see each other socially, and Lennon and McCartney continued to write songs together.

===The Casbah Club and name change to the Beatles===

In the summer of 1959, Mona Best decided to open a club in her cellar, and offered the Les Stewart Quartet a residency if they would help convert the cellar. Harrison and fellow Quartet guitarist Ken Brown, however, missed a show, causing Les Stewart to fire the two and drop the residency. This caused distress to Best, but Harrison offered a solution: he recruited Lennon and McCartney to play, and they returned to calling themselves the Quarrymen. After helping Best finish converting the cellar, the new four guitarist line-up of the Quarrymen (Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Brown) opened the Casbah Coffee Club on 29 August 1959. The opening night performance was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as the cellar had no air conditioning and people were dancing, the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe. The Quarrymen were afforded the use of Brown&#x27;s three input amplifier (which, along with McCartney&#x27;s Elpico, meant that all four guitarists were electric), and sang through one microphone connected to the club&#x27;s small PA system.

The group continued their Casbah residency for the next 4 months into the new year 1960, occasionally securing other gigs. In January, Brown grew ill and was unable to play the show. Best, however, insisted that the Quarrymen still pay Brown, but Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison refused; the incident resulted in the loss of their residency at the Casbah and Brown&#x27;s departure from the group. Shortly after, however, Lennon convinced fellow art school student Stuart Sutcliffe to purchase a bass guitar and join the group. The group had no bookings, but began rehearsing vigorously to allow the musical novice Sutcliffe practice on his new instrument.

In early 1960, the Quarrymen returned to Phillips&#x27; Sound Recording Services to record Lennon&#x27;s new original song &quot;One After 909&quot;, although this recording does not survive. Around the same time, the three made a rehearsal tape at McCartney&#x27;s home. Harrison was absent (as he had an apprenticeship), and the tape features several jams and original songs, including the McCartney instrumental &quot;Cayenne&quot;. With few gigs during this period the group often wrote letters to secure bookings, several of which survive. The four disliked the Quarrymen name, and went through several others during this period, including Los Paranoias. By March 1960, Lennon and Sutcliffe came up with a new name: The Beatles. The Beatles (after several line-up changes, including adding Mona&#x27;s son Pete Best on drums) continued to perform around Liverpool and in Hamburg, Germany, before being signed to Parlophone Records in 1962.

===Reformations: 1994–present===

Since the break-up of the Beatles in 1970 and the murder of John Lennon in 1980, members of the Quarrymen have reunited several times. From 1994 to 1995, Rod Davis and John Lowe recorded an album with studio musicians. This album, &quot;Open for Engagements&quot;, was released in 1995 under the Quarrymen name.

The surviving members of the 1957 line-up of the Quarrymen reunited in 1997 for the 40th anniversary of their performance at the 1957 Woolton village fete, which was the location of the first meeting of Lennon and McCartney. All five surviving members from that day, Pete Shotton, Rod Davis, Len Garry, Eric Griffiths and Colin Hanton, performed. Following this, the group continued to perform, undertaking tours of the UK, the US, Germany, Japan, Russia, Cuba and other countries. The group&#x27;s repertoire focuses on the skiffle and early rock and roll they played in their original incarnation with the added roots rock historical perspective of illustrating how American roots music inspired the nascent Beatles.

In 2000, producer and the Beatles&#x27; historian Martin Lewis produced the group performing the Del-Vikings song &quot;Come Go with Me&quot; (the first song McCartney recalled hearing Lennon sing on the first day they met) for use on the soundtrack of the Michael Lindsay-Hogg film &quot;Two of Us&quot;, a film about the last day that Lennon and McCartney saw each other in April 1976.

Eric Griffiths died in 2005, and Pete Shotton retired, owing to ill health. Shotton died in 2017. As of 2016, Davis, Garry, and Hanton continued to perform around the world. Lowe occasionally performed with them. In September and October 2010, the band undertook a US tour celebrating the 70th birthday of their founder, Lennon. They appeared in a charity concert for Amnesty International honouring Lennon in New York City on Lennon&#x27;s birthday, Saturday 9 October 2010. From 2016 former Beatles bassist Chas Newby performed with the band. He died in May 2023. John Lowe died in February 2024.

Since their 1997 reformation, the Quarrymen have recorded three albums, consisting mostly of covers of 1950s rock and skiffle.

<text>Wellsburg is a village in Chemung County, New York, United States. The population was 580 at the 2010 census. The village is named after the pioneer family of Abner Wells (1737–1797) who came from Southold on Long Island.

Wellsburg is located in the southeast part of the town of Ashland. It is southeast of the city of Elmira and is part of the Elmira Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
The area was settled around 1788. The village was incorporated in 1872.

Christ Episcopal Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

In the 1930s, there were also a Methodist and a Baptist church. Catholics attended services in a church about across the Pennsylvania border (Centerville or Bentley Creek). The village contained two bars, two grocery stores (Aber and Stanton), Dalton&#x27;s meat market, two gas stations, a &quot;creamery&quot;, an Erie Railroad depot, Dalton&#x27;s coal yard, a deteriorated Hotel Alcazar, a post office, and Schuyler&#x27;s Feed, Grain &amp; Lumber Yard. A four-story school served grades 1–12, with a small playground and a ballfield. Some students were bussed in from surrounding areas. One day in 1939, an &quot;autogyro&quot; landed on that ballfield and remained a short time. Wellsburg had a mayor and a constable; the latter being rather &quot;adept&quot; at catching those who overturned outhouses during Halloween.

Occasionally the Chemung River would overflow, usually flooding the short road between Wellsburg and Lowman, but it once flooded Wellsburg to the extent that rowboats could enter the Methodist church. Local farmers hired kids to do farm chores, usually at $0.50 per-day. Youngsters driving tractors into town (for gas) were a familiar sight. During the WWII years, students aged 14 and up were allowed days off from school to help local farmers harvest their crops. There was also an &quot;airplane spotter&#x27;s shack&quot; on the side of a hill, during the war; teens often served as &quot;spotters&quot;.

<text>Otselic is a town in Chenango County, New York, United States, situated on the northern border of Chenango County, northwest of the city of Norwich. The population of the town was 1,054 at the 2010 census. The town is named after a river flowing through it, the Otselic, which is an Oneida word for &quot;place of wild plums&quot;. The Otselic valley is the predominant geographic feature in the town, connecting it to the surrounding region north and south.

== History ==
The first settler arrived around 1800. Many of the original settlers came from Connecticut and Massachusetts. The town of Otselic was founded in 1817 from part of the town of German. The year 1833 was notable for a tornado that passed over the town and measured over a mile in width.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.18%, is water.

Over or about are state-owned forest lands dedicated to the production of forest products and open to the public for forest-related recreation such as hunting, camping, fishing, hiking and cross country skiing.

The highest altitude is just over above sea level along the southern town line, rising from the lowest elevation of approximately at the bottom of the Otselic Valley.

The northern town line is the border of Madison County.

The Otselic River (sometimes &quot;Otselic Creek&quot;) runs through the town and later flows into the Tioughnioga River as part of the Susquehanna River watershed of Chesapeake Bay.

New York State Route 26 intersects New York State Route 80 at Otselic hamlet.

== Wildlife ==
Formerly most of the land was in agriculture, chiefly dairy. Since the end of the nineteenth century, farm abandonment has increased, and today forest cover and early succession forest regrowth dominate the landscape mixed with remaining dairy farms. The forest cover is mixed hardwoods (maple, cherry, ash, beech, basswood, birch and hemlock) occurring naturally and large plantations of spruce and pine on state-owned lands. White pine was common prior to European settlement, but due to the high demand for its clear, light, easily worked lumber, pine stands were removed during the nineteenth century and today are almost totally absent. Logging has always been an important part of the local economy, utilizing high-value hardwoods for sawlogs as well as firewood and softwood poles and pulp.

Hunting, trapping and wildlife-related recreation such as birdwatching and wildlife viewing are important activities. Common wildlife include white-tailed deer, beaver, mink, muskrat, red squirrel, flying squirrel, gray squirrel, chipmunk, coyote, fox, skunk, raccoon, porcupine, opossum, woodchuck, bear, otter, fisher, and bobcat. Bird life is varied and rich. Turkey and grouse are plentiful and are popular game birds. During the summer breeding season, the Otselic area has over 100 breeding bird species, one of the highest numbers of breeding bird species in New York state. Bald eagles breed in the area and osprey are seen regularly along the Otselic River. Ravens are recolonizing the hills, reclaiming their historic range. Red and white winged crossbills from Canada and Alaska have bred in the large conifer plantations on New York State forest land.

Au Sable is two, separate, French Words that translate to &quot;Of Sand.&quot; &quot;Au Sable&quot; should never be clustered under any circumstances. 
Au Sable Forks is made up parts of two Townships, within two counties divided by the two branches of the Au Sable River at The Forks, where they merge into one confluence. It therefore corresponds to two County Seats. 

There are three different denominational Churches found along Main Street, comprising Holy Name Catholic Church, United Methodist Church, and St. James Episcopal Church. The Au Sable Forks Health Care Facility is on Pleasant Street, and the Au Sable Valley Dental Service is North of Main Street. 

The former estate home of James Rogers of the J &amp; J Rogers Company is located in the hamlet. James Rogers the 1st and John Weed were half brothers. They had the same father. James was born in October 1804 in Warren County, NY and John Weed was born in May 1813 in Caldwell, New York, known today as Lake George, New York. However, John did not legally have his father&#x27;s surname of Rogers until 1844 when he became John Weed Rogers. 
The Rogers were prominent citizens originally from the Saratoga region, and business owners who settled in The Forks before 1830. Being earlier settlers, they established and operated the J &amp; J Rogers Co., then purchased the Palmer Hill Iron Mines; they owned and operated the J&amp;J Rogers Iron Co. consisting of their Rolling Mill Forge, the 4-fire East Forge on Forge Street, and the 6-fire Forge in the hamlet of Lower Jay. They operated the Iron Ore Mines on Palmer Hill, Kilns in Swastikia, their huge Charcoal Kiln at Taylor Pond, Company Stores in Au Sable Forks and in the Black Brook Hamlet. Their Industrial Era businesses consisted of the J &amp; J Rogers Co. Pulp Mill, the Hydro Electric Dam at that 1897 Pulp Mill that was in the County of Essex, in Au Sable Forks. The Robeson Acid Plant and the 1901 Paper Mill were across the Au Sable River in the County of Clinton, but still in Au Sable Forks, NY. They employed numerous people dating backing to the establishing Au Sable Forks, as their businesses thrived. They constructed Company Houses for their employees and their families. In Oct. 1970, the economy of the bustling village nearly disappeared after the closure of the huge Paper Mill. It was the end of that Industrial Era.
Many men from there were and remain today employed by NYS Dept. of Law Enforcement as Correctional Officers and some as NYS Troopers.

Au Sable Forks made national headlines in 1987 with the disappearance and subsequent murder of 17-year-old Kari Lynn Nixon, whose story was featured on Unsolved Mysteries.

<doc id="126305" wikidata="Q3123210" url="?curid=126305" title="Rouses Point, New York">
<text>Rouses Point is a village in Clinton County, New York, United States, along the 45th parallel. The population was 2,209 at the 2010 census. The village is named after Jacques Rouse, a French Canadian soldier who fought alongside the Americans during their war for independence. The village is on the western shore of Lake Champlain at the source of the Richelieu River. Also located in the northeastern corner of the town of Champlain, it is north of the city of Plattsburgh and is on the Canada–United States border.

== History ==

Rouses Point was first settled around 1783 by Canadian and Nova Scotian refugees who were granted tracts of land in reward for their services during the American Revolution. 

Steamboats were a booming business on this part of the lake; the second commercial steamboat in the world was launched on Lake Champlain, with Rouses Point as its first port-of-call. Steamboat traffic continued on the lake for the next 100 years until displaced by the railroad.

Edward Thurber built the first frame house in 1818. President James Monroe stayed there. 
After an unnamed first fort (sometimes called “Fort Blunder”) was mistakenly built 1.2 km north of Island Point in Canada, Fort Montgomery was built here between 1844 and 1871 to guard Lake Champlain against possible invasion from British Canada. The fort was never completed and was briefly garrisoned by the U.S. Army during the American Civil War. In 1816 the First stone house built from &quot;Fort Blunder&quot; was a house of worship for Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians. It is still standing as a family home. 

By 1860, Rouses Point had a variety of shops and tradespeople such as loggers, bakers, tailors, carpenters, blacksmiths, prostitutes, and hatters. Its location on the Canada–U.S. border made it an important stop on the Underground Railroad, through which many African American slaves escaped to freedom.

Rouses Point became an incorporated village in 1877, and grew to a population of over 2,000 by 1892. The Delaware and Hudson Railway opened a station, connecting the village to New York City and Montreal.

During Prohibition (1923–33), the village&#x27;s proximity to the Canada–U.S. border made it popular with those who wanted to smuggle illegal alcohol across the border. Rum-running became common, and three speakeasies, one called &quot;The Bucket of Blood&quot;, operated nightly. Organized crime visited the area, bringing with it the usual vices.

During World War II, the community was the scene of substantial shipments of war materials to points north by water and rail.

Today, the lake at Rouses Point has three marinas filled with pleasure craft. 

Wyeth, a pharmaceutical company, formerly employed over 1,000 people.

<doc id="126308" wikidata="Q3708239" url="?curid=126308" title="Ancram, New York">
<text>Ancram is a town in Columbia County, New York, United States. The population was 1,440 at the 2020 census, down from 1,573 at the 2010 census. The town was named after Ancram (now Ancrum), Scotland.

Ancram is in the southeastern corner of the county.

==History==
Prior to European colonization, the area had been occupied for thousands of years by varying indigenous cultures. Historic Native American nations included the Mahican and Wappinger.

Recorded as part of the land grant to the Livingston family, this area on the Roeliff Jansen Kill was originally called &quot;Livingston Forge&quot; after the iron foundry developed on the river. Throughout the eighteenth century, the Livingston forge created metal products for the community. The town was sometimes known as &quot;Scotchtown&quot; due to the immigrants of Scottish ancestry who flocked there in the late 18th century. As the Revolution drew near, the factory produced shot, cannonballs, and perhaps most importantly, the huge chain that was installed across the Hudson River at West Point as a defense against British ships going upriver. The &quot;Fort Montgomery Chain&quot; was worked up in 1776 at the Ancram foundry and placed across the Hudson River near West Point between Fort Montgomery and Fort Clinton. On October 6, 1777, British forces attacked the two forts, choosing to outflank the forts on land rather than test the strength of the chain directly. It is believed that the chain was confiscated by the British forces when they retreated from the fort several weeks later. Its whereabouts is unknown but one prominent British historian surmises it was shipped to Gibraltar to defend shipping in that British colony.

After the Revolution, the town was established from part of the town of Livingston in 1803, and was then called &quot;Gallatin&quot;. In 1814, the name was changed to &quot;Ancram&quot;, after the town in Scotland where the Livingstons had their origins. Part of Ancram was taken to form a new town of Gallatin in 1830.

Mining of iron and lead was important in the early economy; the town of Ancramdale was originally known as &quot;Ancram Lead Mines&quot;.

The hamlet of Boston Corner was formerly part of Massachusetts. Because it was more accessible from Ancram, it was annexed by the New York town on April 13, 1857, by an agreement between the states.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.61%, is water. Most of the town is drained by the Roeliff Jansen Kill and its tributary, Punch Brook. The Roeliff Jansen Kill flows west to the Hudson River. The southeastern corner of the town drains to Webatuck Creek, which flows south to the Ten Mile River and thence to the Housatonic River in Connecticut.

The eastern town line is the border of Massachusetts and of Dutchess County. The southern town line also borders Dutchess County.

<text>Austerlitz is a town in Columbia County, New York, United States. The population was 1,625 at the 2020 census. The town was named after the Battle of Austerlitz.

The town is in the eastern part of Columbia County.

== History ==
Ellis, Capt. Franklin, &quot;History of Columbia County, New York&quot;, (1878), page 381:

The town was organized from parts of the towns of Hillsdale, Chatham, and Canaan, March 28, 1818. A little more than one-fifteenth of the present town was taken from Chatham, a little over one-eighth from Canaan, and a little less than five-sixths from Hillsdale. From the fact that among the first settlers there were no less than twelve families of Spencers, the north part of Hillsdale had been known from the first as &quot;Spencer&#x27;s-town.&quot; This name finally attached itself simply to the village, and when the division of the town was being talked up it was proposed to call the new town &quot;New Ulm.&quot; When the bill erecting it passed the Legislature, however, Martin Van Buren, then a State Senator, and who, being an ardent admirer of the great Napoleon, was somewhat incensed at one of his political opponents (Elisha Williams, if we mistake not), who had succeeded in having a town in Seneca County christened &quot;Waterloo,&quot; leaped to his feet and moved to amend by calling the new town &quot;Austerlitz.&quot; Having carried his point, he retired to his seat, saying &quot;There&#x27;s an Austerlitz for your Waterloo.&quot;

=== Past residents of note ===

Edna St. Vincent Millay, Pulitzer-prize winning poet, lived at Steepletop, a more than property that had previously been a farm. Her sister, Norma, inherited the property at Millay&#x27;s death in 1950. Norma and her husband, Charles Ellis, in 1973 founded a non-profit artist residency program, the Millay Arts (formerly the Millay Colony for the Arts), and deeded a small portion of the land to the organization. In 1978, Norma created the non-profit Edna St. Vincent Millay Society that now oversees the house and remainder of the property. Tours are available.

Steepletop was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

<text>Canaan is a town in Columbia County, New York, United States. The population was 1,570 at the 2020 census, down from 1,710 at the 2010 census. The town is in the northeastern part of the county.

== History ==
The first settlers arrived around 1759. The town was founded in 1772 as &quot;Kings District&quot;. The name was changed to &quot;Canaan&quot; in 1788. One of the oldest sections of Canaan is Frisbie Street, settled in 1770 by Gideon Frisbie, an immigrant from Canaan, Connecticut. Frisbie Street fronts what was once the Albany-Boston stagecoach route.

At approximately 1 p.m. (EDT) on August 28, 1973, an F4 tornado touched down in Canaan and moved in a south-southeast direction across the Massachusetts state line into the town of West Stockbridge, Massachusetts. It caused significant damage to the Berkshire Farm for Boys in Canaan then “obliterated” nearly every house in its path in West Stockbridge. Finally, it leveled the Berkshire Truck Stop on Massachusetts Route 102 near the Massachusetts Turnpike, overturning and throwing trucks and cars and ripping gas pumps out of their stands. When it was over, four people had been killed (including three at the truck stop), 36 were injured, and approximately $25 million ($148 million, 2021 USD) in damage had been done.

The Lace House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

<text>Claverack is a town in Columbia County, New York, United States. The population was 6,058 at the 2020 census. The town name in English was derived from the Dutch word &quot;Klaverakker&quot;, meaning &quot;Clover Fields&quot; or &quot;Clover Reach&quot;. In 1705, a Dutch tenant farmer made the first discovery of a mastodon tooth here.

The town is centrally located in Columbia County, east of the city of Hudson.

==History==
Claverack was originally approximately in area and was known as the Lower Manor of Rensselaer, part of a vast estate on both sides of the Hudson River granted in the 17th century to an early prominent Dutch family. 

During the American Revolution, the Town was formed in 1778 from the older District of Claverack. In 1782, some of the land was reassigned to the newly organized town of Hillsdale. Claverack was reduced again in 1785 to form the city of Hudson.

<text>Clermont is a town in Columbia County, New York, United States. The population was 2,058 at the 2020 census. The name of the town is French for &quot;Clear Mountain&quot;, in reference to the mountain views in the town.

The town is in the southwestern corner of Columbia County, south of the city of Hudson.

==History==
&quot;Clermont&quot; was originally one of the oldest of the great estates of the mid-Hudson valley. The Clermont Manor was established in 1728, in what is now the town of Clermont. The manor was originally part of the Livingston Manor; Clermont was a section in the southwest corner that was bequeathed to Robert Livingston, a younger son. His descendants would come to own more than in the Catskill Mountains and more than in Dutchess County.

Clermont marked the northernmost penetration by British troops up the Hudson River during the American Revolution; Livingston&#x27;s home was burned because of his prominent role in the Revolution. It was rebuilt between 1779 and 1782. The house is now a New York State Historic Site and a National Historic Landmark.

In 1788, Clermont Manor was organized as the town of Clermont.

Clermont was the port of registry of Robert Fulton&#x27;s first steamboat, co-owned by Livingston, which was called the &quot;North River&quot;. Today it is known as the &quot;Clermont&quot;. The ruins of its dock on the Hudson River can still be found at the historic site.

The estate, and later the town, was home to seven generations of the Livingston family until 1962.

The Bouwerie, Thomas Brodhead House, Clarkson Chapel, Clermont Academy, Clermont Civic Historic District, Coons House, Hickory Hill, Old Parsonagee, Sixteen Mile District, and St. Luke&#x27;s Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 6.23%, is water.

The southern town line is the border of Dutchess County, and part of the western town boundary, marked by the Hudson River, is the border of Ulster County. The northeastern border of the town follows the Roeliff Jansen Kill, a tributary of the Hudson River. The border formed by the kill is, for much of its length, quite close to the town&#x27;s southern border; then is its border with the town of Germantown to the west, resulting in long, narrow extensions of the town to the southeast and north.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,726 people, 593 households, and 437 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 725 housing units at an average density of .

==Callendar House, Clermont==
&quot;Callendar House&quot; was built on a bluff overlooking the river in 1794 by Henry Gilbert Livingston (1758–1817), whose country seat was next door. He was the great-grandson of Robert Livingston the Elder through his grandfather Gilbert. In 1795 he sold it to his cousin Philip Henry Livingston (1769–1831), great-grandson of Gilbert&#x27;s older brother Philip Livingston (1686–1749), the second Lord of Livingston Manor. Philip and his wife called it &quot;Sunning Hill&quot; and occupied it until 1828, when it was purchased by Robert L. Tillotson. In 1835, Tillotson sold the property to architect Richard T. Auchmuty.

William E. Toler acquired the premises in 1854; and then Jacob R. LeRoy, son of Herman Leroy, who founded Le Roy, Bayard &amp; Co. Jacob&#x27;s sister, Caroline LeRoy married Daniel Webster. Jacob LeRoy gave &quot;Sunning Hill&quot; to his daughter Charlotte, the wife of Rev. Henry De Koven. De Koven had served at St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Tivoli; he founded and was first rector of Christ Church in Red Hook.

In 1860 it became the property of Johnston Livingston, and then that of his son-in-law, Geraldwyn Redmond. Livingston was on the boards of both Wells Fargo and American Express. &quot;Callendar House&quot; is the name of a former Livingston mansion in Fallkirk, Scotland. It was one of the names Robert Livingston had considered for the Lower Manor, but family members objected that it was a prerogative of the head of the family, and so he chose Clermont instead.

It later came into the possession of Jean de Castella, who raised thoroughbred race horses there. Castella renamed it &quot;Tivoli&quot;.

The property included thirty-five acres. The house has a Federal-style core. A hall bisects the downstairs from front to back. In 1828 one-story wings were added, and around 1830, a veranda. In 1910, a living room was added to the first floor by McKim Mead &amp; White, as well as a south wing. The murals were painted in 1921 by Olin Dows.

<doc id="126314" wikidata="Q3709010" url="?curid=126314" title="Copake, New York">
<text>Copake is a town in Columbia County, New York, United States. The population was 3,346 at the 2020 US census, down from 3,615 at the 2010 census. The town derives its name from a lake, which was known to the natives as &quot;Cook-pake&quot;, or &quot;Ack-kook-peek&quot;, meaning &quot;Snake Pond&quot;.

Copake is on the eastern border of the county. Taconic State Park is along the eastern edge of the town.

==History==
Copake was part of the 1686 Taconic Grant to Robert Livingston, for approximately of good land and of woodland. After it was purchased from the Indians, it turned out to be , and he established the English-style Livingston Manor. The manor extended well into what is now Massachusetts. The first lease given by Livingston in Copake was for about in 1687, to Matthews Abraham Van Deusen. Because New England claimed ownership west to the Hudson River, a border dispute broke out. The Massachusetts Bay Colony laid out three townships west of the Taconic Mountains in 1755. Most of the present town of Copake was in one of the townships. New settlers were given free, and some of Livingston&#x27;s tenants refused to pay rent. The border was settled in 1757 by the Lords Commissioners of Trade in London. Farmers west of the border continued to protest, however. In 1844, a rally organized by the Taconic Mutual Association took place in the center of the hamlet. After the rally, the arrest of several of the leaders sparked wider protests. Eventually the Anti-Rent Party was formed in New York state, and New York instituted land reform. The Anti-Rent Party called for a Homestead Act to develop the western land. It became part of the Republican Party platform and was important in the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860.

The town of Copake was formed in 1824 by splitting it from the town of Granger that was renamed Taghkanic. An early industry was iron mining and smelting. In Taconic State Park adjacent to Copake Falls is the &quot;Ore Pit&quot;, a former iron mine, now a deep swimming pond.

Copake is home to a handful of summer camps for adults and children and filled with other activities to do in the summer, such as swimming, hiking, biking, and water skiing. In the winter, residents and tourists can visit nearby ski mountains, such as Catamount Ski Area.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.04%, is water. The largest water body is Copake Lake, touching the western border of the town, but several other lakes and ponds occupy the central and southwestern parts of the town. The Roeliff Jansen Kill flows through the center of the town, and Taghkanic Creek crosses the northwestern corner; both waterways lead west to the Hudson River.

The town is easily accessible from New York City via the Taconic State Parkway or NYS Route 22 and is a popular destination for second-home owners escaping busy Manhattan. Metro-North Railroad is also located approximately 20 minutes south of the town, with service to and from Grand Central Terminal.

The eastern town line is the border of Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

Copake is located sixteen miles from the small Massachusetts town, Great Barrington.

The battle initially took place nearby onshore in Columbia County but as the Mohicans gained the upper hand, the Mohawk tribe retreated to Vastrick Island. That evening, the Mohicans arrived on the island and launched an attack on what they believed were the Mohawks, sleeping in blankets next to camp fires. After their initial salvo, the Mohicans discovered that the &quot;Indians&quot; were simply blankets wrapped around brush and that they were outflanked by the Mohawks. The result of the battle was the utter decimation of the Mohican warriors and the Indian nation abandoned its Hudson Valley Homeland, retreating to the Taghkanic range in Connecticut. Local legend has it that the island has been haunted by the specters of the slaughtered Mohicans ever since.

<doc id="126318" wikidata="Q3708235" url="?curid=126318" title="Hillsdale, New York">
<text>Hillsdale is a town in eastern Columbia County, New York, near the New York - Massachusetts border and Great Barrington, Massachusetts. New York state routes 22 and 23 intersect near the town center, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The town has several restaurants and a general store, among other businesses. Hillsdale is known for its hilly landscape and is near Bash Bish Falls, Taconic State Park, and the Catamount Ski Area. The Harlem Valley Rail Trail, a 26-mile bike path in two sections, is located not far from the intersection of routes 22 and 23.

== History ==
Much of what would become the town of Hillsdale was part of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck. Due to overlapping boundary lines, portions of the eastern part were claimed by the Province of Massachusetts. Kakeout was established by settlers from New England who raised sheep. Around 1745, Martin Krum is reported to have purchased 800 acres in the western portion of the town from the Van Rensselaer family. Robert Noble and his associates procured the Indian title to land about five miles square in the eastern part and called it Nobletown. The Van Resselaers and the Livingstons leased land on their vast estates to tenant farmers, but those who had emigrated from Massachusetts did not recognized the landlords&#x27; titles. The dispute was not settled until 1773.

<text>Niverville is a semi-rural hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in northern Columbia County, New York, United States. The hamlet of Niverville is located in the town of Kinderhook, south of Kinderhook Lake. The Niverville CDP includes the hamlet as well as all of the land surrounding Kinderhook Lake, extending east into the town of Chatham. The population of the CDP was 1,508 at the 2020 census.

==History ==
Niverville was first settled by the Dutch; the first house was built circa 1707 by Louren Lourenson Van Alen, who obtained the Kinderhoeck Patent—a land grant—in 1629 from Jan Hendrickse DeBruyn, including the area now known as Niverville. Located within the hamlet, Kinderhook Lake—originally called &quot;Wogasawoochuk&quot; or &quot;Big Fish Lake&quot; by the Mohican early Native American inhabitants—provided fertile, peat-rich soil that supported numerous orchards and farms.

The Niver cousins—John Niver and John M. Niver—emigrated to the area from Germany in the early nineteenth century. They built the first gristmill for rye flour; their prosperity built the Niver mansion just across the bridge along County Route 28 in 1848. The hamlet was ultimately named &quot;Niverville&quot; after the prosperous Nivers, although it was long known as Kinderhook Station, after its Boston and Albany Railroad, and Kinderhook and Hudson Railroad turntable, built in 1841. The railroad restaurant known as the Van Hoesen House (not to be confused with the Jan Van Hoesen House some 20 miles south in Claverack) has since become the Niverville Pub, serving the area with live music entertainment on a regular schedule.
In 1846, the Niverville Post Office was established with less than twenty business and residential addresses. Niverville&#x27;s first park—Kinderhook Lake Park, aka The Old Park—was established in 1870 as a picnic and meeting place.

By 1899 the railroad trolleys were electrified and Niverville&#x27;s Electric Park was founded along Kinderhook Lake. Lit by colored lights, the amusement park featured two Ferris wheels (one run by steam, the other by electricity), a carousel, a roller coaster, and other rides, as well as live vaudeville performances held in a dancing pavilion, an aquarium stocked with native fish, and a bathing beach alongside the lake&#x27;s popular boating and fishing activities.

The Niverville Fire Department, established in 1916, is a central community hub serving Kinderhook Lake, residents of adjacent Chatham town along the eastern edge of the lake, and Niverville residents. The current firehouse sits on of land purchased by the Fire Department in 1965. The department maintains an impressive collection of fire trucks—including a vintage 1935 Ford chassis with a Ward LaFrance fire engine body—which are put to use in local parades and festivities, including Niverville&#x27;s Fourth of July fund raiser. The department also hosts an annual Halloween Parade and Party. The Ladies&#x27; Auxiliary of the Niverville Fire Department is an important and active community group who offer refreshments and assist members of the Fire Department in any way possible before/during and after emergency situations. In addition, the Ladies host dinners, banquets, and other fundraisers for the purchase of Fire Department equipment. The centennial anniversary of the founding of the Niverville Fire Department was in 2016.

Niverville is served by the nearby Valatie Free Library, a member of the Mid-Hudson Library System.

The first post office was established in 1832. By the early 19th century there were nine cotton mills in Valatje operating on power derived from the famous waterfalls; the village was incorporated in 1856. With a bustling Main Street, Valatie was considered the center of commerce in northern Columbia County throughout the 19th century.

<text>Cortland is a city and the county seat of Cortland County, New York, United States. Known as the Crown City, Cortland is in New York&#x27;s Southern Tier region. As of 2024, the estimated population of Cortland, New York, is 17,196, reflecting a decline of approximately 1.82% since the 2020 census, which recorded 17,515 residents.

The city of Cortland, near the county&#x27;s western border, is surrounded by the town of Cortlandville.

== History ==
The city is within the former Central New York Military Tract. It is named after Pierre Van Cortlandt, the first lieutenant governor of New York.

Cortland, settled in 1791, was made a village in 1853 (rechartered in 1864), and incorporated in 1900 as New York&#x27;s 41st city. When the county was formed in 1808, Cortland vied with other villages to become the county seat. Known as the &quot;Crown City&quot; because of its location on a plain formed by the convergence of seven valleys, Cortland is above sea level. Forty stars representing the 40 cities incorporated before Cortland circle the State of New York and Crown on the city&#x27;s official seal. The seven points of the crown represent the seven valleys surrounding Cortland. The 41st star in the center of the crown illustrates Cortland as the incorporated city closest to New York&#x27;s geographic center.

Cortland&#x27;s leading industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was the Wickwire Brothers wire-drawing mill, noted for its production of wire hardware cloth for use as window screens. The extent of the Wickwires&#x27; wealth is demonstrated in the two magnificent mansions they commissioned. The Victorian Chateauesque-style home of Chester Wickwire is now operated as the 1890 House Museum &amp; Center for Victorian Arts. Charles Wickwire&#x27;s 1912 home is now owned and operated by the SUNY Cortland Alumni Association. It is open to the public and used by the Alumni Association to host college-related events and house visiting dignitaries.

Cortland was also the location of Brockway Motor Company, a pioneering truck maker. Begun in 1875 as Brockway Carriage Works, it was taken over by Mack Trucks in 1956 and survived until 1977. The city continues to host an annual show of Brockway trucks.

<text>McGraw is a village in Cortland County, New York, United States. The population was 972 as of the 2020 census. The village is named after Samuel McGraw and is in the eastern part of the town of Cortlandville, east of the city of Cortland.

== History ==
The community was first settled in 1805 by Samuel McGraw, who came with his wife and family from Vermont. He built a log cabin (no longer standing) and was followed by Jonathan Taylor and a handful of other New Englanders. McGrawville, as the settlement later came to be known, grew up on either side of the road near McGraw&#x27;s initial homestead, taking advantage of water power on the adjacent Trout Brook to drive an early grist mill (1812) and a sawmill. An ashery was established at an early date to profit from the clearing of new farmlands in the surrounding area, and in 1818, the hamlet acquired its first store. In 1823, a cemetery was established within the boundary of the Main Street Historic District, and, by 1830, ten houses had been built within the small settlement.&quot;

Originally it was called McGrawville, and that name appears on an 1855 map, but it was officially incorporated as McGraw in 1869. (There is a hamlet McGrawville further west in Allegany County, New York.) In the 19th century the community styled itself as &quot;Corset City&quot; for several decades of corset manufacturing. P.H. McGraw &amp; Son produced corsets in the 1880s until mismanagement of an unrelated produce business led them to sell their interests to the Warner Bros. of New York, later known as the Warnaco Group. The factory was reopened and incorporated as the McGraw Corset Company in 1890 and employed over 400 men and women in the area. In 1901, William J. Buchanan, a former employee of both the P.H. McGraw &amp; Son and McGraw Corset Company, founded the Empire Corset Company. The Empire Corset Company was known for the “Never Rust” corset, the “Sorosis” and the “Reduzyou” styles, and sold internationally. They employed 215 women and 35 men. In 1910 the company manufactured one hundred thousand dozen corsets. The McGraw Corset Company was the largest industry in the area, employing over 400 men and women in the factory and, additionally, providing women in the area piece work to do in their homes. Simultaneously, the village was home to the Vesta Corset Company and the Miller Corset Company.

The village was home to New-York Central College, McGrawville, an institution of higher learning founded by Free Baptists in 1849. The college was notable because it was the first college in the United States founded to accept all students, including both women and African Americans. About half of its students were African American. The college also employed three black professors, the first time in the United States where black professors taught white students. A smallpox epidemic, along with social and political opposition and financial problems, brought about the college&#x27;s closure in 1859 or 1860.

In 1852, the village had &quot;some five or six stores, one tavern, and three churches&quot;.

The Main Street Historic District and Presbyterian Church of McGraw are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>A maraca (), sometimes called shaker or chac-chac, is a rattle which appears in many genres of Caribbean and Latin music. It is shaken by a handle and usually played as part of a pair.

Maracas (from Guaraní ), also known as tamaracas, were rattles of divination, an oracle of the Brazilian Tupinamba people, found also with other Indigenous ethnic groups, such as the Guarani, Orinoco and in Florida. Rattles made from &quot;Lagenaria&quot; gourds are being shaken by the natural grip, while the round &quot;Crescentia&quot; calabash fruits are fitted to a handle.

<text>Fleischmanns is a village within the town of Middletown in Delaware County, New York, United States. The population was 351 at the 2010 census. It is named after Charles Louis Fleischmann, a Hungarian Jewish manufacturer.

==History==
Early settlers of this area came from Germany, England, the Netherlands and Ireland. To reach this mountainous place, they traveled by horse and wagon (and later by stagecoach) over rough, dusty roads in summer and rutted, snowy paths in winter. Eventually, the road was resurfaced with planks from Kingston to Pine Hill with the cost of maintenance covered by tollgates along the way. Still, it was a difficult journey until the Ulster and Delaware Railroad reached the village from Rondout and Kingston on May 23, 1870.

Fleischmanns was initially named Griffin Corners in honor of Matthew Griffin, a prominent lawyer (he was admitted to the bar in 1851) and businessman (he owned a store and later a hotel). He also helped to secure the village&#x27;s first post office in 1848. Griffin died on January 11, 1903.

Originally part of the towns of Woodstock and Rochester in Ulster County, the area known today as Fleischmanns became part of Middletown in Delaware County on March 3, 1789. At that time, vast tracts of land were owned by a few individuals and farmed by tenants. All of Fleischmanns land was owned by General Henry Armstrong. The Anti-Rent War, an uprising of Catskill tenant farmers in 1844-1845, led to reforms which put an end to the unfair lease system, and the area began to grow under private ownership.

According to available local sources, it was in 1883 that Charles Louis Fleischmann (born near Budapest, Hungary, educated in Vienna and Prague, founder of the Fleischmann Company famous for its yeast and whiskey) bought property west of the village near the Ulster and Delaware railroad station from John M. Blish. Mr. Blish, an astute local businessman, sold the property at a cheap price to the Fleischmann family, recognizing that a summer colony would bring prosperity. Soon, summer families built beautiful summer homes, abounding with porches, turrets, and terraces and costing $30,000-$40,000 (an enormous sum in those days). They also constructed a deer park, a riding stable, a heated pool filled with spring water and a trout pond: all luxuries unheard-of by the people in this valley. The Fleischmann family even outfitted the Fleischmann-Griffin Corners band with uniforms so that the band could greet the family&#x27;s private railroad cars at the station.

From 1890-1912, the present community actually went by two separate names. From the east end of the village to Division Street (now Bridge Street) was Griffin Corners and from Division Street to the Ulster and Delaware Railroad was Fleischmann (no &quot;s&quot;). When the village incorporated in 1913, it became Fleischmanns.

Fleischmanns Park, which dominated the north side of Wagner Avenue, was a gift to the village in May 1914 from Julius Fleischmann, son of Charles. Among the many interests of the Fleischmann family was major league baseball. The park, formerly known as the Mountain Athletic Club, was where their players came to get in shape before the start of the regular season. One player in particular stood out--Honus Wagner. Wagner was known to his fans as the Flying Dutchman and was admitted to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936. Stipulations were added, which still remain: that it always be used as a park and athletic grounds; that it always be kept in good condition; that it never be sold or sublet and always be of free access to the public. However, in 1934, the village obtained from the heirs a release from the word &quot;free&quot; so that for certain events a fee could be charged.

It was during this period that the village began to grow. Many rich and famous people built summer homes here, among them: Herbert Lehman (Governor of New York, 1932), the Leibman family (owners of Leibman Brewery), and Anton Seidl (conductor of the Metropolitan opera). Nearby on Highmount were the palatial summer homes of coloratura soprano Amelita Galli-Curci and Shakespearean actress Julia Marlowe. Fleischmanns was also home to actress and producer Gertrude Berg.

Lake Switzerland, just north of the village, was built for boating and swimming in the summer and for harvesting ice during the winter. Construction was started in 1906 using teams of horses and oxen for power. The official opening was one year later, when the gate was closed and the lake allowed to fill. However, the dam leaked, and the following year repairs were made. A few years later, townspeople, fearing dam failure would inundate the community, insisted that the dam be lowered by four feet to decrease the pressure against it.

On Main Street, the Skene Memorial Library was founded by celebrated surgeon Alexander Skene and his wife, who were summer residents of Highmount for many years. It was through the influence of Mrs. Skene that a $5,000 donation was obtained from Andrew Carnegie, making construction of the free public library possible. The cornerstone was laid in November 1901. The two war memorials located in front of the library honor those who fought in World War I &amp; II (dedicated Memorial Day, 1954) and those who fought in Korea and Vietnam (dedicated Memorial Day, 1987).

Prior to 1909, the only school was a one-room schoolhouse located on the Old Halcott Road. Increased enrollment made it necessary to add on more rooms and eventually necessitated the erection of Griffin-Fleischmanns High School on upper Wagner Avenue. The name of that school was changed to Fleischmanns High in 1928. After consolidation with Margaretville in the fall of 1968, grades 1-4 remained in the Fleischmanns building. Declining enrollment in the district forced the closing of this building in June 1984. Put on the auction block in 1985, it was purchased by a local businessman (and former student) who converted the old wooden part of the structure into apartments. An art deco brick addition dates from 1935, and currently houses a day center of the Delaware County Association for Retarded Children. The school&#x27;s gymnasium remains intact and is still used for concerts and public functions.

Fleischmanns began to prosper as a summer boarding colony in the late 19th century. The mountains, the fresh air, the spring water, and the time factor involved in reaching the mountains from the city led to a building boom. As more boarders came, more homes and hotels were built or enlarged and they all competed intensely for tourists. It is said that, during the 1940s, the permanent population was 500; but by the Fourth of July there would be 10,000 in town. Of the fifty-some great lodging places within the village and surrounding area, only a few remain: The Regis, Mathes Hotel (Kosher Plaza), Alpine, Lorraine, Fleischmanns Hotel (Roberts&#x27; Auction), Meinstein Lodge (Highland Fling Inn), and the Palace Hotel. However, Fleischmanns is currently experiencing a resurgence as seekers of mountain air and recreation are restoring old homes as well as building new ones.

The Amelita Galli-Curci Estate, Congregation Bnai Israel Synagogue, Maxbilt Theatre, and Skene Memorial Library are listed on National Register of Historic Places.

&quot;Julian Po&quot;, a 1997 movie starring Christian Slater and Robin Tunney, was filmed in Fleischmanns.

&quot;The Dead Don&#x27;t Die&quot;, a 2019 movie starring Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Chloe Sevigny, Tilda Swinton, Selena Gomez and Steve Buscemi, was filmed in Fleischmanns, which was recast as the fictional town of Centerville.

<doc id="126356" wikidata="Q3453086" url="?curid=126356" title="Hobart, New York">
<text>Hobart is a village in Delaware County, New York, United States. The population was 441 at the 2010 census. The village is in the town of Stamford and is on New York Route 10 in the northeastern part of the county.

Since 2005, Hobart has had multiple book stores and has become known as the &quot;Book Village of the Catskills.&quot;

==History==
===18th century===
Prior to 1763, Hobart and its surrounding region were used as hunting grounds by indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands, specifically the Lenape.

In the aftermath of the American Revolution, European-descended settlers moved to the present-day village around 1784, building farms, mills, and inns. Many of these settlers came from Connecticut and New England to seek cheaper farmland. This early group was largely Episcopalian, and constructed the village&#x27;s first church in 1801, placing it so that it was at the center of the village.

The village was initially known most commonly as Waterville. 

===19th century===
In 1828, the United States Postal Service requested that the village rename to avoid confusion with the more populated village of Waterville, New York. The name Hobart was selected to honor John Henry Hobart, then the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. 

Hobart grew in population through the 1800s. By the turn of the century, it was home to a variety of local industry, largely centered around agriculture. A railroad line first connected to the village in 1884 and helped support local agricultural businesses. Some of the most prominent were Sheffield Farms, which operated a local plant from 1888 to 1968, and the E.T. Van Buren lumber and hardware business, which operated from 1906 until 1965. The presence of the railroad helped create and maintain an active tourist trade in Hobart and the surrounding Catskills in the 1920s.

===20th century===
Along with its surrounding region, Hobart saw a decline in business and population during the second half of the 20th century. In 1965, the E.T. Van Buren business burned down and never recovered, and slowly a large number of small businesses closed down as revenues declined and owners retired. 

Dean M. Graham established a pharmaceutical company in the village in 1966, and over the next few decades it grew into a successful business, providing employment for local residents and summer jobs for area students interested in the sciences. After &quot;Doc&quot; Graham sold the company in 1996, the company&#x27;s factory was significantly expanded and is currently owned by Mallinckrodt.

===21st century===
In 2001, William Adams and his wife Diana were traveling near Hobart on vacation and decided to rent a building in the village for a future book business, opening Hobart&#x27;s first book store the following June. A few years later, Don Dales, a local resident who owned several buildings in the village, helped spur local support for emulating the model of Hay-on-Wye and making Hobart into a book village. Since 2005 the village has been home to around six bookstores and has experienced a resurgence of tourism from book shoppers.

In 2014, Bollinger Motors was founded in Hobart and produced its initial B1 prototype in a garage on the western side of the village. In 2018, the company relocated to Detroit, Michigan.

<text>Margaretville is a village in Delaware County, New York, United States. The population was 596 at the 2010 census. The village is in the town of Middletown, on the border of the Catskill Park.

==Geography==
Margaretville is located near the geographic center of the town of Middletown at (42.147496, -74.651090). It is near the eastern end of Delaware County, in the valley of the East Branch Delaware River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.63%, is water.

New York State Route 30 runs through the center of the village, leading northeast to Grand Gorge and west to Downsville. NY 28 passes through the southern part of the village, leading east to Kingston and northwest to Delhi.

==History==
In 1708, Queen Anne of England gave the Hardenburgh Patent to Johannes Hardenbergh and his associates. Chancellor Robert R. Livingston divided of the land among his family. In 1763 Harmanus DuMond was deeded &quot;opposite Margaretville&quot; by Chancellor Livingston. A 1765 map by Will Cockburn shows a road from Marbletown to Pakatakan (near present-day Margaretville and Arkville). In the 1770s, the original settlers paid &quot;one hundred forty-nine pounds and 19 shillings&quot; to American Indians for the land.

In 1778, the East Branch of the Delaware River valley&#x27;s settlers were driven off by the American Indians. In June 1778, a combined force of Tories and Indians led by Joseph Brant raided the valley, including the Margaretville area. On August 26, 1778, a general evacuation was ordered, assisted by guard from Great Shandaken. Before the settlers were driven from their homes, they were given a timely and friendly warning by an Indian named Tunis and returned to the Hudson Valley. The settlers returned after the American Revolutionary War.

In 1779, a deed to a Lot No. 39 was given to Livingston&#x27;s sister, who married Morgan Lewis. A daughter named Margaret was born to them. In 1784 settlers returned to area, including Ignos DuMond, nephew of Harmanus DuMond. He sold his claim of land for $100 to John Tompkins, who then built the first sawmill.

In 1820, the Old Stone Schoolhouse at Dunraven was built. By 1831, Charles Poldino had begun the practice of medicine. Dr. Poldino was also made first postmaster in June 1848, when Margaretville was designated as a post office station. It was actually a small addition made onto the G.G. Decker store.

In 1894, William H. Eells started the &quot;Margaretville Messenger&quot; newspaper. In 1904, Clarke A. Sanford bought the &quot;Margaretville Messenger&quot; and changed the name to the &quot;Catskill Mountain News&quot;. Sanford&#x27;s editorial column was titled &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; and ran until the 1960s.

In 1905, the Delaware and Eastern Railroad (later changed to the Delaware and Northern Railroad) was built. The railroad era lasted only into the 1940s. In 1907, Sanford brought the first automobile (a Pope-Toledo) to Margaretville. In 1922, Sanford built the Galli-Curci Theatre (named for the singer Amelita Galli-Curci) on Main Street. In 1925, Dr. Gordon Bostwick Maurer moved to the community, and his village home quickly became a &quot;veritable hospital&quot;. On October 21, 1930, the Margaretville Hospital was incorporated and was built using a two-story white farmhouse near the current high school. On 1931 January 13, the Margaretville Hospital was opened. It was run by Dr. Maurer until his untimely death in 1938. The hospital was expanded in 1944, and again in 1947. In 1969, the Margaretville Memorial Hospital (dedicated to Dr. Maurer) replaced the older facility.

Margaretville was the hometown of Dr. Orvan Hess, inventor of the fetal heart monitor and one of the first doctors to successfully treat a patient with penicillin. Hess&#x27; becoming a doctor was inspired by Dr. Maurer.

In 1939, the Margaretville Central School replaced a number of smaller local schools. In 1954, the Pepacton Reservoir dam on the East Branch was finished near Downsville, submerging the neighboring villages of Arena, Union Grove, Shavertown, and Pepacton over the next year. This caused a drop in local trade, but the project did give the village its own sewer system.

On January 19, 1996, the entire downtown was damaged in a flood. The village lost ten homes, a gas station, and a diner/ice cream shop. On June 28, 2006, a smaller flood washed out the annual firemen&#x27;s fund-raising carnival. On August 28, 2011, Hurricane Irene caused record flooding and damage. Many buildings sustained structural damage, and over 100 residents had to take shelter in the village fire station. The water peaked at over a foot above the previous record from the 1996 flood. On August 29, 2011, the village&#x27;s CVS Pharmacy collapsed as the floodwaters receded.

On April 24, 2007, Travis Trim of North Lawrence, New York, shot a state trooper, who was saved by his bulletproof vest. The following day Trim died during a shootout in Arkville.

The District 10 School, First Presbyterian Church of Margaretville, Galli-Curci Theatre, and Van Benschoten House and Guest House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Beacon is a city located on the Hudson River in Dutchess County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 13,769. Beacon is part of the Kiryas Joel-Poughkeepsie-Newburgh metropolitan area as well as the larger New York metropolitan area.

Beacon was so named to commemorate the historic beacon fires that blazed forth from the summit of the Fishkill Mountains to alert the Continental Army of British troop movements. Originally an industrial city along the Hudson, Beacon experienced a revival beginning in 2003 with the arrival of Dia Beacon, one of the largest modern art museums in the United States. Recent growth has generated debates on development and zoning issues.

The area known as Beacon was settled by Europeans as the villages of Matteawan and Fishkill Landing in 1709. They were among the first colonial communities in the county. Beacon is located in the southwestern corner of Dutchess County in the Mid-Hudson Region, approximately south of Albany, and approximately north of New York City.

==History==
In 1683 Francis Rombout and Gulian Verplanck, merchant-fur traders from New York City, purchased the land that would come to include the City of Beacon from the Wappinger tribe. The sale was sanctioned by James II of England in 1685 in the Rombout Patent. Rombout died in 1691, leaving his share to his daughter, Catheryna Brett. The Rombout Patent was partitioned in 1706, and Brett received and maintained approximately along the Vis Kill.

Brett sold some of her land to other settlers, often retaining the right to build a flour mill on the property. During the first third of the nineteenth century, Dutchess County ranked first among New York State counties in wheat production. Mills on Brett&#x27;s property attracted farmers from both sides of the river. In 1748 Brett and a group of other settlers agreed to build the Frankfort Store House near the water at the &quot;Lower Landing&quot; north of Dennings Point. This store marked the beginning of river freighting in the area, and Fishkill Landing developed into a river port. As early as 1780 two dozen vessels operated out of Fishkill Landing. John Peter DeWint, owner of 2,000 acres at Fishkill Landing, helped further raise its status as a port by building the Long Dock in 1815. The village of Fishkill Landing was incorporated in 1864.

Matteawan was situated on the Fishkill Creek about a mile and a half east of Fishkill Landing, and a like distance above the mouth of the creek, whose hydraulic properties contributed to its development as a manufacturing center. It lay at the foot of the Fishkill Mountains, and was a station on both the Newburgh, Dutchess &amp; Connecticut, and the New York &amp; New England Railroads, and was connected with the Fishkill Landing by stage, and rail.

The city served a variety of roles during the Revolutionary War. It manufactured war supplies, and served as a fort and signaling point. The city&#x27;s name came from signal fires lit atop nearby Mount Beacon.

During the 1800s, the city became a factory town and was known as &quot;The Hat Making Capital of the US&quot; with nearly 50 hat factories operating at one time. The Matteawan Manufacturing Company was the first in the area devoted to hat production, employing 500 workers. Many others followed, including Dutchess Hat Works, which produced 450 dozen hats daily by 1900 and owned its own showroom in Manhattan.

Beacon incorporated as a city in 1913, combining the villages of Fishkill Landing and Matteawan as well as a small portion of the hamlet of Glenham from the town of Fishkill.
During the 1960s, urban renewal led to the destruction of some significant historic buildings. In 1975, the Dutchess Ski area, which had been a large tourist attraction, was closed. Also in the 1970s, a decline in the economy shuttered most of Beacon&#x27;s factories. This resulted in a severe and ongoing economic downturn that lasted from about 1970 to the late 1990s, during which almost 80 percent of the city&#x27;s commercial business spaces and factories were vacant. Starting in the late 1990s, and with the opening of Dia Beacon, one of the world&#x27;s largest contemporary art museums, in 2003, Beacon began an artistic and commercial rebirth. New development continues to enlarge the city.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The total area is 2.25% water, which includes the Beacon Reservoir.

Located on the eastern shore of the Hudson River, Beacon is noted for its proximity to numerous historic sites and large cities. It is located minutes away from Bannerman&#x27;s Castle and West Point. Beacon also sits with the famous Mount Beacon as its backdrop and the Hudson River as its front door. The city also is located across the river from its larger sister city, Newburgh. Beacon is just 20 minutes south of the Hudson Valley Region capital city, Poughkeepsie. Danbury, Connecticut, lies approximately 30 miles to the east, while New York City is 55 miles to the south.

===Historic neighborhoods===

Byrnsville, or Tioronda, was a hamlet near the mouth of the Fishkill creek, about a mile south of Fishkill Landing, and contained the Tioronda Hat Works. In 1880 it had a population of two hundred and seventeen. The Hat Works occupied the site of an old cotton-mill at this place which failed before 1850. A grist and saw-mill were subsequently built on the site but torn down by Lewis Tompkins in 1878 when the Hat Works were erected. A little below these works is the former site of the Madam Brett grist-mill, for which this has been mistaken.

Groveville derives its name from the extensive oak grove which formerly occupied the site. There was a grist mill at Groveville from a very early day, owned about 1820 by Samuel Upton, a Quaker. who acquired it from Abraham Dubois. Upton also erected on the opposite side of the race a stone building which he used as a fulling mill. Sometime after 1840, the property, was sold it to the Glenham Co., who converted it to a woolen mill, and did carding, spinning and weaving.

The first several blocks of Main Street east of its junction with South Avenue constitutes the Lower Main Street Historic District and features many small businesses located in vintage Italianate-style buildings.

<text>Beekman is a town in Dutchess County, New York, United States. It is part of the Kiryas Joel-Poughkeepsie-Newburgh metropolitan area as well as the larger New York metropolitan area. The population was 14,172 at the 2020 census. The town was named after Henry Beekman, a 17th-century land owner.

==History==

The &quot;Beekman&quot; name became attached to the area in 1697, from Henry Beekman, a Kingston native, who had a large land stake in Dutchess County. In 1697, while serving as a judge, &quot;Beekman obtained a grant from the British crown for what was to be named the Beekman Patent,&quot; which included the present towns of Beekman, Pawling, Dover, Union Vale and &quot;part of LaGrange.&quot; Henry was the son of Deputy Mayor of New York City Wilhemus Beekman, and also served as a delegate in the New York General Assembly beginning in 1691.

Wappinger Indians were reportedly the town&#x27;s original residents before the first European settlers arrived around 1710. The Beekman Patent, granted to Beekman in 1697, was the second largest land holding in Dutchess County. In 1737, Beekman became an official precinct, and local government was established. 1788 was the initial period of establishing towns and counties in the newly independent state of New York, but parts were removed subsequently to form other towns. Beekman contributed part of its territory to the newer towns of LaGrange (1821) and Union Vale (1827). Iron ore extraction and smelting were important in the early economy. The Beekman Patent was a manor until after the Revolution. Residents could only lease the land and pay rent in wheat, fat fowls and work on roads. The series &quot;Settlers of the Beekman Patent&quot; chronicles the lives of all residents there in the 18th century.

A Lutheran church, located off Beach Road, was &quot;probably the first house of worship&quot; in the town. The church is &quot;on the records from 1749&quot; and &quot;served the German settlers who came from the Palatine immigration.&quot; A Quaker meeting house was built in 1771 in Gardner Hollow, and was named the &quot;Apoquague Preparative Meeting.&quot; St. Denis Church, a Catholic church located just beyond the East Fishkill line, also attracted worshipers from Beekman.

===Late 19th century===
Beekman began its &quot;boom&quot; in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as the communities of Sylvan Lake, Beekmanville, and Clove Valley were in the active mining business. Many townsfolk that settled in town during this time were Irish men, escaping the Great Famine, and sent their families to Beekman as well. However, the mining industry died out in the late 19th century, with very few remains today. The most notable one, the &quot;Beekman Furnace&quot;, is still intact on Furnace Road, just off Clove Valley Road.
===Beekman in the 20th century===
After the demise of the mining business in the late 19th century, Beekman saw another boom in the 20th century, with housing developments such as Dalton Farm, the first gas stations, and construction of the first supermarket in town and other stores signalling the beginning of suburban development.

Today Beekman has a total population of 14,000. Comparatively few farms remain, and commerce and industry increasingly shape the non-residential areas of the town.

Most of the town is drained by Fishkill Creek, which flows west to the Hudson River at Beacon. The southern corner of the town is drained by Stump Pond Creek, part of the Croton River watershed that flows to the Hudson at Croton-on-Hudson.

In 1977, Beekman was one of the first volunteer fire departments in the area to acquire the Hurst Tool.

He eventually bought the adjacent property, which was the entire shoreline of Sylvan Lake, and rebuilt St. Denis church for the town. Some iron ore mining also took place along the shores of Sylvan Lake in the early 1930s, and some of these retainer wall pilings are still standing and can be clearly seen from a boat. When the mine was filled with water, construction equipment and mining tools were left on the bottom, and are present today.

<text>Clinton is a town in Dutchess County, New York, United States. The population was 4,037 in the 2020 census, down from 4,312 in the 2010 census.

==History==

The current boundaries of the town of Clinton were set in 1821. The general area was part of a British land grant in 1697 known as the Great Nine Partners Patent. In 1734, a soil survey was done in the Great Nine Partners patent running in 1 1/2 mile wide strips from the Hudson River east through the patent. The particular strip running at the bottom of the patent including the future hamlet of Clinton Corners was classified as good land.

In 1737, the patents were reorganized into precincts, with the current town of Clinton being part of the Charlotte precinct from 1762 until 1788, when the Dutchess County Legislature reorganized the precincts into towns; Clinton was formed from parts of Charlotte and Rhinebeck precincts, and named in commemoration of the service of Governor George Clinton. In 1821, the current boundaries were set when the towns of Pleasant Valley and Hyde Park were created out of the larger Clinton town.

The early European settlers in Clinton filtered in from two primary directions. In the early 1700s, Rhinebeck was the largest settlement in Dutchess County, taking advantage of the Hudson River for transportation of people and produce. Across Dutchess County to the east the settlements of Amenia and Wassaic in the Harlem River valley were also attracting European settlers. In 1718, a road was established branching off from the central Wassaic-Poughkeepsie road to connect to the northern Amenia-Rhinbeck road at the Crum Elbow Creek crossing.

In 1748, the road commissioners from Rhinebeck and Crum Elbow precincts met at the bridge over Crum Elbow Creek to discuss the &quot;old wissasiek road&quot; which had been in existence for 30 years. One of those commissioners was Mordecai Lester. His home and his son&#x27;s home were mentioned in the commission&#x27;s report as landmarks along the road north and south of the hamlet of Clinton Corners.

In addition to the early Dutch and English settlers, by the mid 1700s German Palatines were moving into the western regions of Clinton. By the 1770s Quakers were moving up into Clinton from the southeast.

Clinton participated in the Civil War, with men enlisting in the 128th and 150th regiments. After the war ended, dairy farmers brought their milk by wagon to the creamery in the hamlet of Clinton Corners by the tracks of the Poughkeepsie and Eastern Railway. This rail line continued to the Grove Amusement Park at the southeast end of Upton Lake and the ice house at the northeast end of the lake. After the railway declined with the advent of the automobile, the park closed. During the second half of the 20th century, the town of Clinton transformed from an agricultural into a residential center.

When the town of Dover was formed from the town of Pawling, James Ketcham became the first town clerk.

George Casey was the first postmaster. Mail was delivered on horseback.

<text>Hyde Park is a town in Dutchess County, New York, United States, bordering the Hudson River north of Poughkeepsie. Within the town are the hamlets of Hyde Park, East Park, Staatsburg, and Haviland. Hyde Park is known as the hometown of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd president of the United States.

Hyde Park is home to the main campus of the Culinary Institute of America, a four-year college for culinary and baking and pastry arts, and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum, the first presidential library in the United States.

Hyde Park&#x27;s population was 21,021 at the 2020 United States Census. U.S. Route 9 passes through the town near the Hudson River.
==History==
Settlement of the region by Europeans officially began around 1742 but may have begun as early as 1710.

The name of the area was changed to &quot;Hyde Park&quot; around 1810. Previously, it was part of the Fauconnier Patent and was named &quot;Stoutenburgh&quot;, after the town&#x27;s first settler, Jacobus Stoughtenburg. Part of the town was from the Great Nine Partners Patent of 1697.

Doctor John Bard had called his estate &quot;Hyde Park&quot; in honor of Edward Hyde, who was Lord Cornbury and governor of New York from 1702 to 1708. In 1697, Hyde granted nine close friends of his a large swatch of land &quot;south of Albany&quot; in the Great Nine Partners Patent, which would eventually make up much of Hyde Park. In 1804 a tavern-keeper named Miller, seeking new guests, renamed the tavern &quot;the Hyde Park Inn&quot;, much to the annoyance of Doctor Bard. He then applied for a post office to be located at his inn, common among tavern keepers. The request was granted as the &quot;Hyde Park Post Office&quot;. The settlement gradually came to be known not as Stoutenburgh but as Hyde Park, which it officially became in 1812.

Hyde Park was a part of Clinton, New York, until 1821 when it was incorporated as a separate town. The Hyde Park Railroad Station, located at the mouth of Crum Elbow Creek along the Hudson River, was used by the town&#x27;s residents, including the Roosevelts.

The town includes Frederick William Vanderbilt&#x27;s spring and autumn mansion, now maintained as the Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site.

===The Roosevelt family===
Hyde Park is the hometown of Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882–1945), who served as president of the United States from 1933 until his death in 1945. His estate, Springwood, is the site of the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site maintained by the National Park Service. Also on the site are his presidential library and museum. Roosevelt used this residence throughout his life. FDR&#x27;s historical house is now a museum that can be visited.

His house is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, as are the homes of Eleanor Roosevelt, Isaac Roosevelt, and Frederick William Vanderbilt, along with Haviland Middle School (formerly Franklin D. Roosevelt High School).

Val-Kill was the home of Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of Franklin D. Roosevelt. It is located about east of the home of FDR.

Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt are both buried in the rose garden at &quot;Springwood&quot;.

President Roosevelt&#x27;s father, James Roosevelt, Sr., served a term as supervisor of the town of Hyde Park.

<text>LaGrange ( ) is a town in Dutchess County, New York, United States. The population was 15,975 at the 2020 census. The town was named after the estate of the Marquis de Lafayette.

==History==

The town was originally established in 1821 as &quot;Freedom&quot; from parts of the towns of Beekman and Fishkill. Confusion with Freedom, a town in Cattaraugus County that had been settled ten years earlier and established one year earlier, caused the name to be changed to &quot;LaGrange&quot; in 1828.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.17%, is water. The town of LaGrange is located within the Hudson Valley region of New York. The towns bordering LaGrange are Union Vale to the east, Beekman to the southeast, East Fishkill and Wappinger to the south, Poughkeepsie to the west, and Pleasant Valley to the north, with a small part of Washington also bordering LaGrange.

===Roads===
Three state highways bisect the town and connect it with other towns in Dutchess County and the surrounding area. The Taconic State Parkway is a north–south parkway through LaGrange. James Baird State Park, which provides a golf course, playground, sports fields, and hiking and cycling trails, is located in LaGrange along the Taconic Parkway. The parkway also serves as an important commuter road for LaGrange, connecting the town to points south, including White Plains and New York City, to the south.

New York State Route 55 is an east–west road that goes through the center of the town; Arlington High School, the Freedom Plains United Presbyterian Church, and multiple shops and stores are located on a two-mile section of Route 55 in Freedom Plains, a hamlet of LaGrange. In the summer and fall of 2014, three traffic circles were added to this stretch of Route 55 in Freedom Plains in an effort to ease congestion and also to beautify this part of LaGrange. To the west, Route 55 connects LaGrange to the city of Poughkeepsie, the closest urbanized area to LaGrange, ; to the east, Route 55 connects LaGrange to the town of Pawling and the Route 22 corridor. It is located halfway between Poughkeepsie and Pawling, about from both.

New York State Route 82 is a highway that goes southwest–northeast through the town, from Hopewell Junction to Moores Mills. Route 82 connects LaGrange with Millbrook to the north and Hopewell Junction to the south.

There are also several county roads that go in various parts of the town.

==Parks and recreation==

Freedom Park is the largest and most extensive park belonging to the town of LaGrange. At the park, there is a small, spring-fed lake in which patrons are permitted to swim under the supervision of Red Cross-trained lifeguards. There is a set of eight 25-yard lap lanes that enables the town to support a swim team. There is a concession that sells snacks at the lake. Freedom Park also boasts a bandstand and a large, permanent, open-air pavilion; there is a small playground as well. Each summer, a day camp is offered by the town at Freedom Park.

Other parks in LaGrange include Stringham Park, an extensive complex of soccer fields located on Stringham Road in the west of the town, and James Baird State Park, which provides a golf course, playground, and cycling and hiking trails.

<doc id="126379" wikidata="Q3250367" url="?curid=126379" title="Milan, New York">
<text>Milan ( ) is a town in Dutchess County, New York, United States. The town is in the northern part of the county and is very rural. As of the 2020 census it had a population of 2,245, slightly down from 2,370 in 2010. Milan is located approximately north of New York City, south of Albany, and west of Boston. It is bordered by Rhinebeck and Red Hook to the west, Pine Plains to the east, Stanford to the southeast, Clinton to the south, and Gallatin to the north by Columbia County. The only major route in the town is the historic Taconic State Parkway, though NY 199 serves as the main local thoroughfare.

==History==

The area that comprises Milan today was the western part of the Little Nine Partners Patent of 1706. Milan was largely a farming and mill town and remains very rural.

The first settler in the area was Johannes Rowe. The son of a Palatine immigrant, Rowe bought from Robert Livingston, 3rd Lord of the Manor of Livingston, and built a stone house in 1766 on what is now Rowe Road near the Milan Town Hall. The remains of the house were photographed in 1940 for the Historic American Buildings Survey.

===Establishment of town and post office===
The New York State Legislature voted on March 6, 1818, to create the town of Milan from the western part of the town of North East, to be effective &quot;from and after the last day in March&quot; 1818. The session laws stated that the first town meeting would be held the first Tuesday of April and at the home of Stephen Thorn, who was elected town supervisor along with John F. Bartlett, town clerk.

Two 19th century histories of the town of Milan and Dutchess County (1877 and 1882) state there is no knowledge or evidence as to why the name &quot;Milan&quot; was chosen, but the name Milan had appeared in other areas of the state, and it was not unusual to take European city names at the time. What is now the city of Syracuse was known as &quot;Milan&quot; for a brief period between 1809 and 1812. A settlement south of Syracuse was originally called &quot;Milan&quot; in 1790 before incorporation in 1802 as the town of Locke. An unincorporated village there continued to be referred to as &quot;Milan&quot; but the Milan designation for that post office was changed to &quot;Locke&quot; on July 29, 1817. This cleared the way for the operation of the Milan post office on August 14, 1818, at what is now Case&#x27;s Corners.
=== A town &quot;in-between&quot; ===
The main thoroughfares for the community ran from the Hudson River to Salisbury, Connecticut, and travelers referred to the road as the &quot;turnpike.&quot; It later became recognized as the Salisbury Turnpike, and sections of the road still exist today and bear that name.

In addition to farming and local mills in Milan, lead and iron were mined in areas around what is now Millerton, New York, and Salisbury, Connecticut, which was then brought to Livingston&#x27;s furnaces at Ancram in Columbia County. Milan was &quot;in-between&quot; those towns and the river and as a result had a great deal of important commercial traffic going east–west through the town.

=== Remains least populous town ===
The early population peaked in 1840 at 1,745 residents and went into decline until 1930 with only 622 residents. It was the opening of the Erie Canal (1825) and then the development of the railroad and the move to river cities and the western migration that caused the decline. Also, Milan&#x27;s soil was hilly and rocky and tough to farm. Then following the 1930s and the Great Depression the population grew again, due in part to the construction of the Taconic Parkway, which ended in Milan at the time, and then the post-World War II boom.

The 1840 population level was reached again in 1980, some 140 years later. From the 1980s to the turn of the new century, Milan was one of the fastest-growing towns in Dutchess County. However, it remains the least-populous town in the county.

== Development ==
In 2002 the Durst Organization, largely known for its high-rise developments in Manhattan, bought that straddles the town of Milan and Pine Plains, with plans to create a second home and recreational community. The original proposal included almost 1,000 homes along with golf courses. Durst&#x27;s January 2010 revised plans would allow for 624 homes (572 in Pine Plains and 52 in Milan).

By 2002 Red Wing Sand and Gravel of East Fishkill had bought two large parcels in the northern part of Milan ( on Turkey Hill Road and on Academy Hill Road) with a view to operating two large-scale mines. But on March 30, 2010, the New York Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Town of Milan and its town-wide ban on mining. The town was defended successfully by the office of the New York Attorney General, preventing the mining company from proceeding to develop mines at those locations.

==History==
The site of present-day Millbrook was originally part of a much larger land grant given in 1697. In the years before the American Revolution, two nearby settlements - Mechanic and Hart&#x27;s Village - were established within the confines of the modern Millbrook.

In 1869, the Dutchess and Columbia Railroad commenced operating with a stop called Millbrook, named after an adjacent farm. This new rail stop lay between Mechanic and Hart&#x27;s Village and the economic opportunities it afforded soon led to a developing village centered on the Millbrook stop. However, it was not until 1895 that Millbrook was incorporated as a village.

Millbrook is the site of the Hitchcock Estate, which Timothy Leary made a nexus of the psychedelic movement in the 1960s and where he conducted research and wrote &quot;The Psychedelic Experience&quot;.
