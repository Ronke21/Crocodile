<text>Marianna is a borough in Washington County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 399 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Marianna was built as a mining town for the Pittsburgh Buffalo Company in 1907 and was incorporated in 1910. At the time of its construction, the Marianna Mine was among the most modern and well equipped in the world. The town&#x27;s brick homes were designed to offer indoor bathrooms, fenced yards and other amenities making living conditions very attractive for the time.

At 10:55 a.m. on the morning of Saturday, November 28, 1908, an explosion occurred in the mine which killed 154 men and left only one survivor. Although the mine was quickly refurbished by the Pittsburgh Buffalo Company, the colliery&#x27;s fortunes flagged. By 1914, the mine was sold to the Union Coal and Coke Company and later to Bethlehem Steel which continued to extract coal until 1988, when the main conveyor caught fire. The fire was extinguished, but the mine closed anyway.

<text>Monongahela, referred to locally as Mon City, is a third class city in Washington County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 4,149 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, about south of Pittsburgh proper.

The city of Monongahela sits at a location where several locally important Pennsylvania state routes meet: a concurrency between Pennsylvania routes 88, 136, and 837 makes up most of the length of the city&#x27;s Main Street, and the city&#x27;s Park Avenue carries Pennsylvania route 481 to its northern terminus at Main Street.

The Monongahela tribe was also indigenous to the area prior to the settlement of the city.

The original tract of land was actually owned by three different men, who named their land areas Eden, Paradise, and Gloucester. Joseph Parkison, who operated a ferry on the west bank of the Monongahela River, is recognized as the founder of the city. Parkison built the town&#x27;s first post office, and in 1782 the town was officially recognized as Parkison&#x27;s Ferry. Adam Wickerham took claim to on the Parkison Ferry tract on July 1, 1788. On this tract he laid out Georgetown in 1807. Georgetown was made part of Williamsport by Wickerham on February 23, 1816. In 1833, the first borough officers were elected for Williamsport. On April 1, 1837, Williamsport was given the name Monongahela City and in 1893 shortened to Monongahela.

The city contains a number of streets which are named in honor of prominent Civil War figures including: Lincoln, Grant, Sherman, Stanton, Meade, Hancock, Thomas, Howard, Geary, and Sheridan.

==Culture==
Monongahela is home to several parks, playgrounds and a museum. Chess Park, located near the center of the city, hosts community events throughout the year. The Mounds Park, built on the site of an ancient Indian Burial Ground, is a local playground and sports complex. On the banks of the Monongahela River is the Aquatorium, a waterfront venue that hosts the annual Fourth of July celebration and an annual summer concert series. The Monongahela Area Historical Society Museum located on Main Street serves as a community archive and has local historical artifacts on display.

Whiskey Point, a bluff overlooking the Monongahela River located within the city, was an important meeting place during the Whiskey Rebellion. The Pennsylvania State Historical Marker located here reads: &quot;The bluff at Main St. and Park Ave. was the site on Aug. 14, 1794, of a meeting of 226 whiskey rebels. Albert Gallatin&#x27;s eloquence turned the tide, resulting in peaceful ending of the Whiskey Rebellion and the possibility of civil strife.&quot; Today, “Monongahela Rye” (also called Pennsylvania Rye) is a style of rye whiskey characterized by its mash bill containing 95% or more rye, thereby making for a spicier whiskey, barrel-aging notwithstanding. While regionally recognized, this term has no legal binding.

Many buildings in Monongahela, such as the Longwell House and the Bethel A.M.E Church, were used by freed slaves as stops on the Underground Railroad.

There are twenty churches representing fifteen denominations located in Monongahela, including The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), which has its worldwide headquarters in Monongahela.

===Park Avenue===
Park Avenue in Monongahela was home to numerous notable residents. NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana grew up on the road. Other notable residents have included Carl E. Vuono, four-star general and Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army; Jim Jimirro, founder of the Disney Channel; Fred Cox, all-time leading scorer for the Minnesota Vikings and inventor of the Nerf ball; Dr. Ronald V. Pellegrini, a world-renowned cardiothoracic surgeon based in Pittsburgh; National Book Award winner, Dierdre Bair; and former Pittsburgh Pirate pitcher, Ron Necciai, who is the only professional baseball player to strike out 27 batters in one game.

A 90-minute documentary about Park Avenue&#x27;s notable residents, titled &quot;One Extraordinary Street&quot; was produced by Laura M. Magone and released in 2008. Magone, a graduate of Duquesne University and a Monongahela native, spent several years interviewing persons who lived on Park Avenue in an attempt to determine if there was a common thread that may have contributed to their many successes. The film also includes cameo appearances by Stan Musial and retired four-star general Colin Powell.

<text>Peters Township is a township in Washington County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 22,915 at the 2020 census. It is a suburb of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
Peters Township was incorporated in 1781 as one of Washington County&#x27;s thirteen original townships. It had fallen within the area claimed by Virginia as its Yohogania County before the resolution of that state&#x27;s boundary dispute with Pennsylvania. Over the years, portions of Peters Township were sectioned off to form other municipalities; eventually, leaving the present configuration of .

Peters Township was named after William &quot;Indian&quot; Peters. There is uncertainty regarding Peters&#x27; race, with some sources holding that he was an Indian and others that he was a white man who traded with local Indians. Regardless, the Indian name has long-been associated with Peters Township.

Some of the first settlers were James and Joshua Wright, James Matthews, John Sweringer, Rev. David Phillips, Andrew Dunlevy, Daniel Townsend, William Fife and Robert Bell. Peters was initially a farming community and then later on coal became a major industry that resulted in the development of Hackett, presently a small settlement 1.2 miles (2 km) east of Venetia.

Peters Township remained a sparsely populated rural community until the 1950s. In 1950 the population was 3,004. By 2000, this number had increased to 17,556. In 1976, the township&#x27;s home rule charter became effective. This altered the form of government from the prevalent Second Class Township Supervisor format to the present Council-Manager form.

The township&#x27;s current arrowhead logo was adopted with the new home rule charter. An arrowhead found in Peters Township was adopted as the pattern.

Peterswood Park, located in the township, is home to the Peters Township Recreation Center, as well as several football, baseball, softball, and soccer fields. In addition, there is an amphitheater as well as several pavilions.

== Commercialization ==

South Strabane Township has undergone a rapid burst of commercial and residential development starting in 1998. In this year, two new shopping centers, Strabane Square and Trinity Point, were constructed. The shopping centers sit astride Interstates 70 and 79, as well as US Route 19 and State Route 136. The township&#x27;s location at the juncture of these major arteries, in addition to US Route 40, has played no small part in its rapid commercial development. A third major commercial center, The Foundry, opened in spring 2007. The Foundry has since closed due to land subsidence and all major stores have moved out.

A housing boom occurred simultaneously with the commercial development. Washington Woods and Washington Lake, two higher class developments, were recently finished. Villas on the Green, a development of primarily carriage/cluster homes, was also finished along Country Club Road. New housing starts include Cameron Estates, a development of nearly 150 single family units paralleled with another 150 ready made modular duplexes located along Cameron Road. Strabane Manor, a 232 unit townhouse complex, was recently started along Fischer Road. It sits opposite of the Stonecreek development, a developing apartment complex with over 200 units. In addition to these developments, The Preserve at Timber&#x27;s Edge, a smaller development of houses clustered in the wooded areas along Lakeview Drive, was recently approved for development. In the works include a possible &#x27;empty-nester&#x27; aimed development near the Route 19 corridor.

Most importantly, the township board of supervisors, in conjunction with the Washington County Redevelopment Authority and the Trinity Area School Board approved the Tax-Incremented Financing (TIF) Plan for Bass Pro Shops and Tanger Outlet Malls. These developments will be larger than all of the township&#x27;s current developments and will be located alongside of Interstate 79. The developments will be located close to The Meadows Racetrack and Casino in neighboring North Strabane. Development plans include a large Outdoor World store, in addition to other Bass Pro Shops developments. Bass Pro also intends to install sizable outdoor recreational and test facilities for ATVs, boats, and hunting gear. Next to the Bass Pro Shops will be Tanger Outlet Malls, a company nationally known for its development of outlet malls. The outlet center, which is slated to hold over 150 stores, will be similar in composition to the Grove City Outlets, located north of Pittsburgh, but will be slightly larger than that development.

Also, a large development, located between US Route 40 and Interstate 70 in an area known as the &#x27;Zediker Corridor&#x27;, is in the planning stages through Consol Energy, Inc. Consol Energy, a company well known throughout southwestern Pennsylvania, is a large mining company that hopes to develop over with commercial offices. The areas around this development will be heavily developed with residential satellite developments. This development is over two times the size of the nearby SouthPointe, a development of commercial offices with some housing.

<text>Washington is a city in, and the county seat of, Washington County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 13,176 at the time of the 2020 census. Part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area in the southwestern part of the state, the city is home to Washington &amp; Jefferson College and Pony League baseball.

==History==
Delaware Indian chief Tangooqua, commonly known as &quot;Catfish&quot;, had a camp on a branch of Chartiers Creek, in what is now part of the city of Washington. The French labeled the area &quot;Wissameking&quot;, meaning &quot;catfish place&quot;, as early as 1757.

===18th century===
The area of Washington was settled by many immigrants from Scotland and the north of Ireland along with settlers from eastern and central parts of the Colony of Virginia, first settled around 1768.

The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed an act on March 28, 1781, establishing the County of Washington and naming &quot;Catfish Camp&quot; as the place for holding the first election. It was the first county in the U.S. to be named in honor of George Washington, commander of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War and the nation&#x27;s first president.

David Hoge laid out a plan of lots immediately after the legislature&#x27;s action. His original plot carried the name &quot;Bassett, alias Dandridge Town,&quot; but before the plot was recorded, lines were drawn through &quot;Bassett, alias Dandridge Town&quot; with ink, and the word &quot;Washington&quot; was written above. There have long been rumors among locals that the town was named &quot;Washington&quot; because George Washington spent the night in the region once. This is not true however; Washington had never been to the area.

The original plot dedicated a tract of ground to the people for recreational purposes. A lot was given for a courthouse where the current building now stands, and Lots 43 and 102, according to the plan, were presented by Hoge to &quot;His Excellency, General Washington, and Mrs. Washington.&quot;

Washington, Pennsylvania, was the center for the &#x27;Whiskey Rebellion&#x27; of 1791, which was one of the first open rebellions against the new U.S. government and Constitution. The rebellion was centered on a tax being imposed on whiskey distillation in the region. The house of David Bradford, one of the leaders of the rebellion, is now a museum devoted to the Whiskey Rebellion, the David Bradford House, located on South Main Street of the city.

===19th century===
The town was incorporated as a borough on February 13, 1810, and became a class three-sized city in 1924.

In August 1875, construction began of the Waynesburg and Washington Railroad, conceived by John Day in 1874 and chartered in 1875. Passenger services ended in 1929, conversion to standard gauge followed in 1944, when it was renamed the Waynesburg Secondary. Freight services ended in 1976, although part of the line still survives for access to a coal mine.

The discovery of oil and natural gas at the Washington oil field caused a boom period from the 1880s to the early 1900s.

James B. Wilson chartered the Washington Electric Street Railways in 1889 with construction beginning in November 1890. The first line was built from the Waynesburg and Washington Narrow Gauge station to Wilson Orchard, just north of the present day site of the UPMC Washington hospital.

===20th century===
In 1903, the Washington and Canonsburg Railway Company linked Washington to Canonsburg, Pennsylvania with a trolley line. The company was bought by the &quot;Philadelphia Company&quot; in 1906, later becoming part of the Pittsburgh Railway Company, linking through to Pittsburgh as part of their interurban service in 1909. The line closed on August 29, 1953. A short section of the line and a number of trolley cars are preserved at the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum north of the city.

<text>West Alexander is a census-designated place in Donegal Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania, and formerly a borough in Washington County. Located less than a mile east of the border with West Virginia, the population was 604 at the 2010 census, just short of double the population of 320 recorded in the 2000 Census. The borough was dissolved into surrounding Donegal Township, effective January 1, 2009.

==Geography==
West Alexander is located at (40.104190, -80.507841), right on the border of West Virginia.

==Dissolution==
Though the borough had a successful commerce center based on antique and gift shops in its National Register of Historic Places-listed historic district, a fire in 1990 destroyed several of those businesses and closed others. The town never completely recovered. The fire, combined with a $3.2 million debt for a sewage treatment plant, forced residents to consider a merger with Donegal Township, which was completed in 2009.

<doc id="134089" wikidata="Q1186380" url="?curid=134089" title="West Brownsville, Pennsylvania">
<text>West Brownsville is a former important transportation nexus and a present-day borough in Washington County, Pennsylvania, United States and part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The population was 972 at the 2020 census. Culturally, by postal route, and socially, the community is connected to cross-river sister-city Brownsville. The two towns were long joined by the Amerindian trail known as Nemacolin&#x27;s Path that became a wagon road after the American Revolution. In present times, however, West Brownsville is a separate municipality. Brownsville was the first point where the descent from the Appalachians could safely reach the river down the generally steep banks of the Monongahela River. Between Brownsville and West Brownsville was a shallow stretch, usable as a river ford astride a major Emigrant Trail to the various attractive regions in the Northwest Territory, the first National Road, the Cumberland Pike (Now U.S. Route 40).

==Geography==
West Brownsville is located at (40.029731, -79.886412).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and (8.51%) is water.

==History==
West Brownsville was sited on the inside of the sweeping curve along the Monongahela River and has relatively level ground opposite the cut bank effect giving Brownsville relatively steep slopes and West Brownsville, cupped by the inside of the curve, more flood-prone sandy mud flats lands. Historically, at a bit upstream of the location of the Brownsville-West Brownsville Bridge was the Amerindian crossing ford and wagon road of early westward migrants. A few hundred yards west from the shoreline, PA Route 88 enters from along the riverside bluff and the south as &quot;Lowhill Road&quot; and hugs the foot of the steep Pennsylvania hillsides flanking tongue-shaped flat terrain of the streets and housing through most of the length of W. Brownsville before twisting left uphill. It exits the W. Brownsville flat climbing Northwest as &quot;Blainsburg Road&quot;, climbing beside and below the bluff of Blainsburg, a larger &#x27;satellite&#x27; bedroom community really an extension of the community, situated above West Brownsville proper, to its North-Northwest.
The steep bluff behind the West Brownsville tongue provided two climbable ascents which became early U.S. roads; the more southerly heading nearly due west climbing steadily upwards over a stretch, an old wagon road, and later the National Road following the westward extension of Nemacolin&#x27;s Path up to and through the outlier neighborhood known as Malden from a river-shallows area known as a ford to Amerindians, a landscape feature which attracted settlers heading west on the Emigrant Trail once known as Nemacolin&#x27;s Path, then the Cumberland Road and then renamed as the &#x27;National Road&#x27;. The other ascent would allow PA Route 88 to climb out of the valley where the road cut across several loops of the Monongahela to California.

==Transportation and railroad ==


Sundered by the county boundaries running down the center of the river, West Brownsville economically was integrated with cross-river Brownsville by a ferry dating back into the early 1800s when Brownsville became a riverboat building and outfitting center. With construction of boats on nearby large tributaries, the shallow banks of West Brownsville were a favorite location to tie up and outfit a new built water craft to outfit it and load cargoes. The modern-day Main Street is notable for featuring on-street running by freight trains down the center of the street. Considered one railroad crossing, it is one of the longest crossings in the United States. Along with right bank Brownsville on the opposite shore, West Brownsville and Brownsville hosted extensive rail yards jammed into the tight confines along both banks of the Monongahela River. One special feature at either end of the two railyards was they each shared a bridge joining two river crossing wyes that tied together to contain a rare true-life reversing loop, normally a feature only found in model railroading layouts. The yards serviced the extensive rail hopper car deliveries feeding the coking ovens up river along the southside of Brownsville, and were integral parts of the famous Pittsburgh Steel Industries. The Monongahela Railroad represented the Lake Erie, the PRR, and the B&amp;O, and Norfolk and Western both utilized the trackage in the towns, which today is operated by the N&amp;W&#x27;s successor, Norfolk Southern with the Monongahela vanishing into the Conrail debacle.

<text>Damascus is a second-class township in Wayne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The township&#x27;s population was 3,659 at the time of the 2010 United States Census.

==History==
Damascus Township is the fifth and largest of the original townships created with the establishment of Wayne County in 1798. It remains the largest despite the fact that the entire townships of Lebanon and Oregon and portions of Dyberry and Berlin Townships were excised from its territory. Damascus was the setting for many significant historic events in Wayne County history beginning with the first settlement at Cushetunk along the Delaware River. Joseph Skinner and his family of eight children were among the earliest of the Connecticut settlers who arrived about 1755 although unsubstantiated stories place Moses Thomas there as early as 1750. At the time ownership of this area of northeastern Pennsylvania was in dispute because King Charles II had granted a charter to Connecticut in 1662 and in 1681 he granted a charter to William Penn and the boundaries of each charter overlapped. In addition, these early inhabitants were also beset by attacks by Indians who also laid claim to the territory.

The Damascus Historic District, Milanville Historic District, Hill&#x27;s Sawmill, and Milanville-Skinners Falls Bridge are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

<text>Honesdale is a borough in, and the county seat of, Wayne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The borough&#x27;s population was 4,458 at the time of the 2020 census.

Honesdale is located northeast of Scranton in a rural area that provides many recreational opportunities, such as boating, fishing, hiking, hunting, skiing, biking, skateboarding, and rafting. Located in a coal mining region, during the nineteenth century it was the starting point of the Delaware and Hudson Canal, which provided for transport of coal to Kingston, New York, and then down the Hudson River to New York City. In the 19th century, the expansion of railroads eventually superseded regular use of the canal.

==History==

The discovery of anthracite coal in northeastern Pennsylvania in the early 1800s and the need to transport this valuable fuel to New York City gave birth to the Delaware and Hudson Canal, the American Railroad, and the Borough of Honesdale. Honesdale was named for Philip Hone, former mayor of New York and president of Honesdale&#x27;s Delaware &amp; Hudson (D&amp;H) Canal Company. Honesdale, originally called &quot;Dyberry Forks,&quot; was laid out as a village in 1826 when the D &amp; H Canal was created. It was incorporated as a borough on January 28, 1831.

The Honesdale Residential Historic District and the D&amp;H Canal are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Birthplace of American railroading===

Honesdale is home to the first commercial steam locomotive run on rails in the United States, the &quot;Stourbridge Lion.&quot; On August 8, 1829, the Stourbridge Lion started in Honesdale, ran three miles to Seelyville, and returned; Honesdale, therefore, is known as the birthplace of the American Railroad.

The &quot;Stourbridge Lion,&quot; owned by the Delaware &amp; Hudson (D&amp;H) Canal Company was regrettably considered too heavy for further use. D&amp;H transported anthracite coal from mines near Carbondale to New York City via Honesdale and Kingston, New York. Coal was moved by a unique gravity-railroad from the mines to Honesdale where it was transferred to barges and transported via a 108-mile canal to Kingston, New York, then shipped by river barges down the Hudson River to New York City.

What remained of the &quot;Stourbridge Lion&quot; passed into many hands over the coming years and was eventually acquired by the Smithsonian Institution in 1890. The main boiler is currently on loan at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Museum in Baltimore, Maryland.

The Wayne County Historical Society Museum contains a full-scale replica of the &quot;Stourbridge Lion;&quot; the Society also displays many historical photographs, artifacts and other exhibits. The D&amp;H Railroad Company built the replica using original blueprints for the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago. The replica was relocated to Honesdale in 1941.

Passenger excursions run seasonally from Honesdale to Hawley along the historic Stourbridge Line. The railroad runs twenty-five miles along the Lackawaxen River. Excursions depart from the platform at the Wayne County Visitors Center.

<text>Preston is a second-class township in Wayne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The township&#x27;s population was 1,014 at the time of the 2010 United States Census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Preston Township has a total area of 51.546 sq mi (133.51 km2), of which 49.419 sq mi (128.00 km2) is land and 2.127 sq mi (5.510 km2), or 4.126%, is water.

The township and surrounding area has been called &quot;the highlands of Wayne [County]&quot; because it is especially mountainous. About half of the highest peak in the county, Mount Ararat (historically called Ararat Mountain, Ararat Peak, Ararat Summit, or simply &quot;Ararat&quot;), is located in the village of Orson (the other half of it is in Belmont Corners in Mount Pleasant Township), as is the entirety of Sugarloaf Mountain (formerly called Sugar Loaf Peak or Sugar-loaf Mountain), another especially prominent summit.

It is also known for its abundance of lakes, most of which are fed by natural springs on their lake bottoms. As a result of this latter fact, combined with its generally high elevation, two significant Pennsylvania rivers, the Lackawanna and the Lackawaxen, begin in Preston Township. Specifically, Bone Pond (or Summit Lake) and Lake Lorain (or Five Mile Pond) in the village of Poyntelle and Independent Lake (formerly known as Independence Pond or Independent Pond, and sometimes known today as Lake Independence or Lake Independent) in Poyntelle and Orson are three of the four sources of the East Branch of the Lackawanna (the fourth being Dunn Pond, or Dunns Lake, in the village of East Ararat in Ararat Township in Susquehanna County), while the West Branch of the Lackawaxen rises from a confluence of several small, unnamed streams in Orson and Poyntelle.

==Communities==
The following villages are located in Preston Township:

*Lake Como
*Lakewood (once called Winwood)
*Orson (once called Hine&#x27;s Corners)
*Poyntelle
*Preston (also called Preston Corner)
*Preston Center
*Preston Park
*Shehawken
*Tallmanville
*Wrighter Corner

<text>Starrucca ( ) is a borough that is located in Wayne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The borough&#x27;s population was 169 at the time of the 2020 United States Census.

==History==
Starrucca was named after the founder&#x27;s horse, which he rode as he surveyed the land. Other says Starrucca means either where waters meet in a Native American language, or that it is from a more ancient term meaning &quot;where dreams go to die.&quot; (Star (rucca, dying, as in a dying star).

The historic Stone Arch Bridge over Starrucca Creek was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 1, 1979, and was delisted on May 8, 1986, after being demolished.

In 2003, Dennis and Donna Corrigan were honored by the Wayne County Historical Society with its Historic Preservation Award for their restoration of the Major Elisha Strong House in Starrucca. Born in 1818, Strong was a resident of New York and a former major in a militia unit who was awarded a 410-acre portion of the Pennsylvania estate of John Sherwood in 1852, including a plank house with board-and-batten siding and hemlock plank floors and doors. Built circa 1800, the house was later expanded with a Greek Revival-style addition. Strong subsequently formed a partnership with Guernsey Osborne and began operating the Starrucca Tannery; he then moved his family to Starrucca in 1862 and added cattle breeding and lumber production to his business portfolio. By 1872, he owned most of the town&#x27;s land and buildings. Following his death in 1895, his widow, Estelle Strong, was awarded ownership of what would later become known as the Major Elisha Strong House; she then retained that ownership until 1921.

The Barnes House, which is located on Depot Hill on Little Ireland Road in Starrucca, is a large clapboard residence that was built by Homer Spencer in 1888. Shortly thereafter, Spencer built a three-story grist mill; his historic property was then purchased eleven years later by Miles Kenyon and Arthur Laribee who took over the mill&#x27;s operations before selling the mill and house to Stephen Decatur Barnes and his wife, Hattie (Armstrong) Barnes in 1910. Barnes subsequently added an extension to the mill&#x27;s south side, upgraded the nearby dam from a wooden to concrete structure, and then continued to operate the water-powered grist mill until 1940, when a new power source was installed. The mill, which finally ceased operations in 1986, was purchased by William and Valerie Tilton in 1994.

<doc id="134125" wikidata="Q4731358" url="?curid=134125" title="Allegheny Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania">
<text>Allegheny Township is a township in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 8,316 at the 2020 census, an increase from 8,002 at the 2000 census. It is the northernmost municipality of Westmoreland County. The municipality borders the townships of Buffalo, Harrison, Upper Burrell, and Washington; and the boroughs of Oklahoma, Vandergrift, Leechburg, West Leechburg, Lower Burrell, Freeport and Hyde Park. It is served by the Kiski Area School District.

==History==
Although there are many who believe Allegheny Township was formed in 1796, it appears, according to available records, that the Township was actually formed from Washington Township in 1820. At its formation, Allegheny Township included what is now Lower Burrell, Hyde Park, Vandergrift, West Leechburg, Arnold and New Kensington. There had been an earlier Allegheny Township formed by the Westmoreland County Court of Quarter Sessions in December 1795, north of the Kiskiminetas River in what is now known as Armstrong County. The area was a hunting ground for Seneca, and later, Delaware Indians.

The Allegheny Township Community Building, which is the municipality&#x27;s government center, was constructed in 1976 and completed the following year at the intersection of the PA Route 356 by-pass and Junior High School Road, after state and federal funds became available from legislators to finance the project. The project happened in conjunction with the completion of the 356 bypass that same year. The building consisted of a large double door auditorium with a separation curtain to divide the room in half if needed, a zoning office, supervisor&#x27;s office, tax office, municipal authority office, conference room, storage room, a kitchen and a police station. Prior to the building&#x27;s completion, the township conducted business from a rented basement office at Kiski Park Plaza shopping center on Route 56 at the intersection of the 356 by-pass.

A new police station was built on the Community Building grounds in 2006.

Louise Majocha became the township&#x27;s first woman supervisor in 1983. She was appointed to fill the unexpired term of Milton L. Rimmel, 46, who died July 2 of that year due to a heart attack. Majocha was appointed by the two surviving board members, Fred Hoculock and Ron Sheetz prior to the end of July. However, she chose not to run for election in November, and left office in January 1984, being succeeded by Dennis Francart.

In 1983, the Township increased its full-time police force from two to three officers, in addition to putting a third patrol car on the road.

Ralphaela J. Stoner became the township&#x27;s first woman elected as supervisor in the late 80s.

<text>Arnold is a city in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the Greater Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The population was 5,157 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Present-day Westmoreland County was part of the hunting reserves of the Iroquois Indians. White colonists began to penetrate the area in the 1750s, and circa 1781 Robert McCrea purchased the land on which Arnold is situated. William Jack acquired the property and later passed it on to Wilson Jack. The area around Arnold was first settled in 1852 by Major Andrew Arnold, who grew up in Kittanning.

With the creation of Westmoreland County in 1773, the area that became Arnold was originally part of Burrell, and later Lower Burrell, townships. Arnold was then part of the newly created city of New Kensington from 1891 until it was separately incorporated as a borough in January 1896, and as a third-class city in 1939. Arnold is governed under Pennsylvania&#x27;s third-class city code, with a mayor, treasurer, controller, and four council members elected at-large. Past mayors of Arnold have been M. Frank Horne (1939-1960), Alfred Colaianni (1960-1963), Willie DeMao (1963-2004), John Campbell (2004–2012), and Larry Milito (2012-2016).

Karen Peconi-Biriccochi, a Democrat, took office in 2016. In 2018, during protests over the shooting of an unarmed African American teen by a white police officer in East Pittsburgh, Peconi authored a social media post that urged law enforcement to &quot;bring the hoses&quot; against the protesters. Calls for her resignation resulted in city council formally requesting the state legislature to remove her from office. On May 21, 2019 Peconi-Biriccochi was defeated by Councilman Joseph Bia II in the Democratic primary, effectively ending her bid for re-election in the heavily Democratic city. Bia was subsequently elected to a full term as mayor in November 2019 and took office in 2020. Bia was defeated in the 2023 primary by former police chief Shannon Santucci, who took office in 2024.

==History==


The first settlers arrived in Bolivar about the year 1829 and settled between Tubmill Creek and the Conemaugh River. Most of the men were employed by the Pennsylvania Canal. The canal was located on the south side of the Conemaugh River. Some of the locks still may be seen west of town.

Several small brickyards were started in the area, producing a red brick. Some of the houses on Second Street were constructed of these brick. They are still well-preserved today after exposure to the elements for over a century.

The Pennsylvania Railroad replaced the canal in 1846. Brickyards No. 1, and No. 2, and No. 3 were constructed between the Conemaugh River and the railroad. Bolivar was beginning to grow and prosper and was known as a &quot;Brick Town&quot;. In 1863 Bolivar withdrew from Fairfield Township and became a borough, under the grounds that it was designed like many other boroughs of the time, in a checkerboard pattern. Bolivar borough was incorporated November 25, 1863.

The north side of the Conemaugh was a very desirable location for new construction of brickyards due to the completion of the Western Pennsylvania Railroad from Blairsville to Bolivar, and the close proximity to coal and clay. No. 4 Brickyard at the time of its first operation was the largest brickyard in the North American continent, having a capacity of 100,000 paving blocks each day. The Robinson Brothers also constructed a brickyard, and it is the only one in existence at the present time, being known as Garfield Refractories Co. The Enamel Works started in 1899 with a large government contract. The Bolivar School was constructed of brick made from the Enamel Works.

J. B. Hammond got control of the five brickyards in Bolivar and several in Clearfield County just before the start of the 20th century, and a rapid expansion took place. This might be called &quot;The Golden Era of Bolivar.&quot; A large hotel was started near the station and a large department store was planned for Washington and Second Streets. Pipes were laid under the streets for central heating, but the dream was never realized. A panic took place in 1902, the bank failed (the depositors were paid in full later) and the brickyards were forced into receivership.

From 1914 through the 1920s, Bolivar enjoyed its second boom period. Soissons and General Refractories took over the brickyards and the Lacolle Mine and Ridgeview Coal Mines were opened, and shipped large quantities of coal. Mining, lumbering and manufacturing employed many persons. The Lincoln Brickyard enjoyed a brief period of prosperity under the leadership of Lorenzo Mumford. He was a leader, designer of bricks, and salesman, and kept the yard going for many months. He sold a million bricks to the Chase National Bank in New York for construction of one of its banks.

Bolivar was hit hard by the Great Depression of the 1930s. The following losses during the depression and the years ensuing have not been replaced in many instances. Bolivar has lost six brickyards, two large coal companies, restaurants, flour and feed mill, railroad station, express station, two banks, lumber yard, opera house, movie house, dentist office, The Bolivar News, Cornet Band, swimming pool, bakery, jewelry store, furniture store.

The Antiochian Village was established in 1978. The Ligonier Meeting of American bishops took place there in 1994.

<text>Calumet-Norvelt was a census-designated place (CDP) in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The community was divided into the two separate communities of Calumet and Norvelt for the 2010 census. Although the US Census treats Calumet and Norvelt as a single community, they are in reality two very different communities, each reflecting a different chapter in how the Great Depression affected rural Pennsylvanians. Calumet was a typical &quot;patch town&quot;, built by a single company to house its miners as cheaply as possible. The closing of the Calumet mine during the Great Depression caused enormous hardship in an era when unemployment compensation and welfare payments were non-existent. On the other hand, Norvelt was created during the depression by the US federal government as a model community, intended to increase the standard of living of laid-off coal miners.

==Geography==
Calumet-Norvelt is an unincorporated community within Mount Pleasant Township. Calumet-Norvelt is located at (40.213730, -79.493121). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

==History of Calumet==

Calumet was founded by the Calumet Coke Company in 1888 as a housing site for its workers. The community, as originally laid out, consisted of twenty double-houses, twelve single-family houses, and a few commercial and industrial buildings. The workers were employed in a coal mine and also tended ovens that produced coke (fuel). In 1894, Calumet was the site of a bitter coal miners’ strike against the H. C. Frick Coke Company, which at that time was part-owner of Calumet Coke Company.

The coke works closed in the 1920s, and the mine closed in the early 1930s during the Great Depression, causing enormous hardship for the community&#x27;s workers.

==History of Norvelt==

Norvelt, originally named Westmoreland Homesteads, was created April 13, 1934, as one of a series of “subsistence homesteads” under the National Industrial Recovery Act. These communities were intended to allow rural inhabitants to have an improved quality of living, while largely growing their own food. It was hoped that these new communities would raise the standard of living for unemployed coal miners from nearby Calumet and similar &quot;patch towns&quot; in the area. Accordingly, each lot was a minimum of , and other land was set aside as a cooperative farm. The community&#x27;s layout and home designs were created by Paul Bartholomew, an architect who had also designed many notable buildings in Greensburg.

In 1937, the community&#x27;s name was changed to Norvelt (EleaNOR RooseVELT), following a visit by Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

<text>Delmont is a borough in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. The population was 2,592 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Delmont was initially known as New Salem. The 300 acres of land was warranted to William Wilson in 1784, and upon his arrival in 1785, he named the area New Salem. In 1812, a post office was established in New Salem, &quot;Salem X Roads&quot; (Salem Crossroads), Pennsylvania. Hugh Bigham was the first postmaster. Wilson continued to farm on the land until he died in 1796.

After Wilson died in 1796, his estate was divided between his sons, Thomas and George. It was not until 1812 that the patent was validated. Eventually, the family conveyed their deeds to Thomas, who became the property&#x27;s sole owner. Thomas divided the property into 48 lots to form a crossroads village. Thomas Wilson designed the town around a watering trough built in 1810 by Hugh Bigham. The watering trough was initially known as the running pump. The watering trough was connected with wooden pipes to a big Spring that&#x27;s never known to run dry. In 1814, 48 lots were auctioned off two days before Christmas to form a crossroads town. As the area developed, the town was referred to locally as Salem Crossroads.

On April 8, 1833, the town was incorporated as &quot;New Salem Borough.&quot; The mailing address was Salem Crossroads until 1871 when town postmaster Zachariah Zimmerman changed it to Delmont. The town and the post office carried two different names until May 16, 1967, when residents voted to change the borough&#x27;s name to Delmont after a promotional campaign by then-Mayor Franklin Mangery. Major navigational roads were built through the area in the late 18th century, and local Route 66 was built in 1800. The East-West Northern Turnpike was completed in 1819, linking Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. Delmont was a busy stagecoach stop boasting at one time five stage coach lines through the village. Travelers would stop, tired and hungry, and patronize the several inns and taverns in town. In 1853, the Pennsylvania Railroad was completed through Westmoreland County to Pittsburgh. This was a faster, more economical way to travel. In 1855, the last stagecoach passed through the crossroads village, ending the stagecoach era for the crossroads town.

Several areas and businesses in and around the borough still carry the Salem reference. Others refer to &quot;Cloverleaf,&quot; which referred to the interchange at Routes 22 and 66, formerly a &quot;cloverleaf&quot; style exchange. It was changed to a single-point diamond interchange in 2000.

In the late 1970s, the Salem Crossroads Historical Restoration Society worked to maintain the local history and restore the area. As a result of its efforts, the National Register of Historic Places listed the Salem Crossroads Historic District in 1978. In 1980, the society purchased Shields Farm. The farm hosts an annual Apple&#x27; N Arts festival during the first week of October; the festival held a 40th-anniversary event in 2022. 

The society disbanded at some point after its initial accomplishments. Downtown Delmont lost some businesses with the opening of chain retailers along the U.S. Route 22 corridor. Residents have discussed ways to reinvest in downtown Delmont and focus again on the town&#x27;s historic resources.

&quot;Salem Township and Delmont&quot;, a book about the area&#x27;s history by writer Tracy Searight, was published in 2012.

==Geography==

Delmont is located at (40.412971, -79.571433). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land. Delmont has been assigned the ZIP Code 15626.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 2,497 people, 1,070 households, and 714 families residing in the borough. The population density was . There were 1,139 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the borough was 97.96% White, 0.52% African American, 0.04% Native American, 0.44% Asian, 0.04% from other races, and 1.00% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.24% of the population.

There were 1,070 households, of which 31.0% had children under 18 living with them, 55.4% were married couples living together, 9.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.2% were non-families. 29.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 12.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.33, and the average family size was 2.91.

The borough&#x27;s population was spread out, with 24.4% under 18, 6.2% from 18 to 24, 31.0% from 25 to 44, 24.7% from 45 to 64, and 13.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.2 males. For every 100 females aged 18 and over, there were 88.2 males.

The median income for a household in the borough was $39,700, and the median income for a family was $52,056. Males had a median income of $39,097 versus $25,804 for females. The per capita income for the borough was $21,090. About 4.6% of families and 6.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.1% of those under age 18 and 14.9% of those aged 65 or over.

==Education==
Most primary and secondary education is provided by two school districts - Greensburg Salem, in Greensburg, and Franklin Regional, in Murrysville. Students to the south and east of the borough are generally assigned to Greensburg Salem, while the bulk of the students in the borough, and those who reside in the north and west portions, attend Franklin Regional.

The Franklin Regional district consists of three elementary schools (Sloan, Newlonsburg, Heritage), Franklin Regional Middle School, and Franklin Regional High School. The Greensburg-Salem District consists of three elementary schools (Metzgar, Nicely, Hutchinson), Greensburg-Salem Middle School, and Greensburg-Salem High School.

==Roads==
Aside from the historical genesis of the town as a toll intersection and stagecoach stop, one of Delmont&#x27;s notable characteristics is that it is the meeting point of two major highways, U.S. Route 22 and State Route 66.

These roads were not directly intersected for many years but were linked by a cloverleaf interchange. Delmont became known for this interchange; many local merchants incorporated &quot;Cloverleaf&quot; into their business names. In 2000, the &quot;cloverleaf&quot; system was dismantled, and a single-point urban interchange was built in its place. This change was made to accommodate the widening of Route 22, one of Pennsylvania&#x27;s most heavily traveled roads. The interchange on Route 22 marks the boundary between suburban Pittsburgh and the more rural foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.

Other notable roads within Delmont&#x27;s borders include Old William Penn Highway, which begins at the termination of Pittsburgh Street, just west of Route 66, and Manor Road, which begins on the west side of Route 66 as well, just across from Greensburg Street, and runs from 66 through the southeastern portion of the 22/66 corridor until it reaches Route 22 outside of city limits, as 22 goes toward Export and Murrysville.

==Historical sites==
* The watering trough provided 19th-century stagecoach horses water from a spring. The watering trough was disconnected from the big spring in the 1970s; it was refurbished by The Delmont Lions club and still stands today.
* Several buildings near the intersection of East Pittsburgh and Greensburg streets are historically relevant. The building at 1 West Pittsburgh Street is a notable historic building that formerly served as The First National Bank of Delmont and Mook&#x27;s Hardware, among other stores. The Central Hotel is a historic building that served as lodging for early stagecoach passengers. This now serves as an office for several businesses. Other historic buildings near this block include the former Delmont firehouse and the current Agway building, which dates back to the late 1800s when it was a flour mill. 
* Salem Evangelical Lutheran Church was constructed in 1868. Today, the church is nationally recognized as a historical place and still holds worship every Sunday morning.
* Jacob Earnest&#x27;s home, built in 1825. Earnest was a descendant of Indiana Eve. He owned a gunsmith shop and was a woodcarver and rifle maker in the area. He also served on the city council. 
* Eastview Union Cemetery. Those interred include Jimmy Ripple and Jacob Earnest. 
* Riddle Cemetery, a private cemetery on Mark Drive near the former Apple Hill Playhouse. A small cemetery with the marked graves of a few settlers and some unmarked graves. It is believed that some Native American remains may also be buried there. The grounds are cared for by private residents; for several years, local Boy Scout troops tended this area.
* Robert Shields tannery, located on East Pittsburgh Street. Now a private home, this was once the Shields&#x27; tannery during the early days of New Salem.
* Shields Farm, frequently used for gatherings and recreation. The farm is the location of the Apple&#x27; N Arts Festival, &quot;Christmas in Salem Crossroads&quot;, and Delmont Area Athletic Association (D.A.A.A.) recreational baseball and softball games. 
* Apple Hill Playhouse hosted plays and theatrical performances, including theater productions and educational classes for children. The theater commemorated its 50th season in 2006. Apple Hill closed its doors in 2020; its future fate is unknown. 
* The former Delmont Public School Building - a prominent building downtown. It held classes from 1898 until the early 1980s when Franklin Regional consolidated its elementary school buildings. Until recently, it was the home of the Delmont Public Library; it houses several offices, including some borough offices, and also hosts some classroom and meeting spaces. 
* Delmont Public Library - after several decades in the former school building, a new library was built adjacent to nearby and opened in 2021.

<text>:&quot;There are also four Derry Townships in Pennsylvania.&quot;
Derry is a borough in Westmoreland County in Pennsylvania, east of Pittsburgh. The Borough of Derry, consisting of the town area, should not be confused with Derry Township, which is a separate municipality surrounding the borough. The population was 2,637 at the 2020 census.

==History==

===19th century===
Originally known as Derry Station, the borough was created in 1852 to serve the Pennsylvania Railroad. It was named after the village on PA Route 982 originally known as Derry and now known as New Derry (even though it is older than the community being discussed here). The original &quot;Derry&quot; in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, was named after the City of Derry in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland, because the area’s first non-Native American inhabitants were Scotch-Irish.

Derry was ideally suited for major railroad facilities because of its ready access to water from McGee Run (essential in the era of steam locomotives) and because it sits atop a slight summit along the railroad right-of-way. In Derry&#x27;s heyday in the late 1800s, it had four hotels, mainly to serve railroad workers, as well as a roundhouse for locomotive maintenance and a massive railroad yard. Derry was incorporated as a borough on October 22, 1881.

===20th century===
Derry served as the terminal for Pittsburgh commuter trains until 1964, when the Pennsylvania Railroad ceased operating its commuter service. Railroad Days Festival, held annually, serves to remind residents of Derry&#x27;s railroading heritage.

Little remains of Derry&#x27;s railroading boom, although some might notice an unused railroad right-of-way that extends from Derry westward to PA Route 981, running slightly north but parallel to the currently-used railroad tracks. This was an ill-fated project known as the Derry-Donohoe-Jeannette bypass, in which the Pennsylvania Railroad attempted to build a new main line that would avoid the curves and slopes of the existing main line, bypassing Latrobe and Greensburg. Construction of the bypass began in the 1920s, including a large trestle near Bradenville, but the new route was never completed.

Derry and Latrobe were linked by the Westmoreland County Railway Company, which was an interurban operating from 1904 to 1932.

A helicopter crash into a crowd assembled for a festival at St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church in Derry killed eight people and injured 18 others on Labor Day, 1978. The railroad crossing in downtown Derry has also been the site of other fatal accidents.

==Crest==
The center of the crest is adorned with St. George’s Cross. St. George was a martyr, one of the most famous in Christendom, and is noted for refusing many bribes and offerings to renounce his faith. He also gave all of his possessions and holdings to the poor. The heart, in the upper left corner of the cross, is sectioned with a bar rising up that signifies love for God.

The lower part of the shield is draped with noble ermine as a backdrop for the two charges that respectfully represent community values and Derry’s rich railroad heritage. The railroad theme is carried on at the top of the design with a crest emblazoned with the borough’s name and establishment date. The decorative foliage around the design is tinted blue for loyalty and gold for generosity. The tincture also represents the local school’s colors and the borough’s commitment to youth and education. The lower banner motto resonates the strong foundation of community reserved for the families that call the borough home and an acknowledgment of the greatness of the country in which Derry is located. The crest portraits a very noble ideal of community, heritage, charity and endless love for God in the face of danger. The crest was designed by Borough Councilman Richard L. Allison (Rick) and enthusiastically approved by the Derry Borough Council as the official crest of Derry, PA. In communication with the Mayor of Derry, located in County Londonderry, in present-day Northern Ireland and in the province of Ulster, it was adjusted to incorporate the importance of railroading in the borough’s growth and how it came to be the largest employer in the borough until the 1950s.

==Geography==
Derry is located at (40.333037, -79.301011). According to the U.S. Censusu Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and (2.41%) is water.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Derry has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

The first school to open in East Huntingdon was a schoolhouse built on Gaut&#x27;s Dairy Farm in Alverton. It was opened in 1802. East Huntingdon continued to open multiple schoolhouses throughout much of the 1800s. The first East Huntingdon school board election occurred on October 6, 1834. With the advent of the school board, the first school district in the area was formed with school taxes being introduced. The township was divided into districts, most prominently the East Huntingdon Township and Scottdale School Districts. In the fall of 1964, the two districts combined to form Southmoreland High School

The West Overton Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

The township was the site of the Morewood Massacre of 1891, which occurred during a labor union protest.

Several farms encompassed the area of downtown East Huntingdon, known as Bessemer, until the late 1960s when businesses began to purchase the rural areas. Several businesses formed to create the Countryside Plaza. One of the original stores, JK&#x27;s County Market had previously opened as a butcher shop in 1929 but expanded into a discount grocery chain with the advent of the shopping plaza. It closed in August 2019 and was replaced by a Busy Beaver hardware store. Countryside Plaza encompasses 16.9 acres of land and is home to 20 retail stores. In 2000, East Huntingdon expanded with the creation of Summit Ridge Plaza, located directly across from Countryside Plaza on Pennsylvania Route 819.

On June 19, 1947, the Ruthorn Drive-In Theater opened in East Huntingdon on Pennsylvania Route 119 near the Scottdale exit. The theater was originally a single screen, drive-in movie theater. It was renamed the Evergreen Drive-In Theater in 1949. The theater added two more screens in 2002, which remain as of June 2024.

<text>Greensburg is a city in and the county seat of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 14,976 at the 2020 census. Located southeast of Pittsburgh, Greensburg is a part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The city lies within the Laurel Highlands and the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau. The city is named after Nathanael Greene, a major general of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War. 

== History==

After the end of the Revolutionary War, an inn was built along a wagon trail that stretched from Philadelphia west over the Appalachian Mountains to Fort Pitt, now the city of Pittsburgh. A tiny settlement known as Newtown grew around the inn, which is today the center of Greensburg&#x27;s Business District at the intersection of Pittsburgh and Main Streets. At Pittsburgh, the wagon trail became Penn Avenue.

Hannastown was the original Westmoreland County seat. According to historian John Boucher, after Hannastown was attacked and burned by &quot;Indians and Tories&quot; in 1782, efforts began to relocate the county seat. On December 10, 1785, county officials contracted with Christopher Truby and William Jack to purchase two acres of Newtown land to erect public buildings. Ludwick Otterman later subscribed to the agreement. Boucher, therefore, designates December 10, 1785, as the date Newtown became the Westmoreland County seat.

The first courthouse and jail were a single building built of logs and heavy planks. The jail portion had a heavy stone wall that extended some distance above the ground, &quot;perhaps to keep prisoners from cutting their way out&quot;. Court was first held in this structure on January 7, 1787. The Westmoreland County Courthouse, in its various incarnations, has stood on this site ever since. The area surrounding the courthouse became Greensburg (&quot;Greenesburgh&quot;, as some documents referred to it at the time). It was named for American Revolutionary War General Nathanael Greene. Greensburg was formally incorporated as a borough on February 9, 1799, making it the first borough in the county.

In the early 19th century, Greensburg had very little population growth (see population data table in this article). After 1850, Greensburg became a growing county seat with inns and small businesses. A railroad stop and the discovery of large areas of soft coal nearby made it the center of a vigorous mining industry in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Several coal mines (Greensburg/Keystone Nos. 1 and 2, Hawksworth, and Radebaugh) were opened in and around Greensburg during this period with nearly all of the coal being shipped by rail. 

Seton Hill College, formerly St. Joseph&#x27;s Academy, became a four-year women&#x27;s institution in 1918. Greensburg became a City of the Third Class on January 2, 1928. After World War II, more residential areas were developed in various sections of town. Greensburg&#x27;s cultural status grew as the Westmoreland County Museum of Art opened in 1959 and the University of Pittsburgh founded the branch campus, the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg, in 1963, now located in Hempfield Township.

The opening of Greengate Mall and Westmoreland Mall in 1965 and 1977, respectively, marked a new era for retail shopping in the area but negatively impacted retail businesses in Downtown Greensburg&#x27;s shopping district. Changes in local shopping habits had already taken their toll by the late 1970s when Troutman&#x27;s Department Store closed. By the mid-1990s, city officials shifted their revitalization plans on the cultural aspects of Downtown Greensburg, such as the restorations of the Palace Theater and the historic Train Station, as well as a performing arts center for Seton Hill University. Also, in July 2009, Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, the largest medical school in the country, opened a satellite campus at Seton Hill University. Now, over 200 students study at LECOM at Seton Hill every year. As part of this ongoing transition, an expansion of the Westmoreland Museum of American Art was completed in 2015.
The city is home to the Diocese of Greensburg.

== Neighborhoods ==
The city of Greensburg is currently composed of eight wards, most of which were formerly boroughs and are divided into several neighborhoods. Bunker Hill, now Fifth Ward, was merged into Greensburg in 1894. The name originated because of fights at the rowdy Bushfield Tavern in the early 1840s to mid-19th century that were compared to the Battle of Bunker Hill.

In 1905, Greensburg absorbed three adjacent boroughs, including Ludwick, now Sixth Ward, which was named for Ludwick Otterman, an early settler for whom the street is also named, as well as East Greensburg, now Seventh Ward, and Southeast Greensburg, unofficially known as Paradise (Eighth Ward). South Maple Avenue was originally named Kinderhook (Third Ward). Second Ward, located north of Downtown Greensburg, is the largest ward and includes the neighborhoods of Saybrook Village, Evergreen Hill, New Salem Acres, Country Club Meadows, Northmont, Devonshire Heights, Rose Fountain Farms, and Academy Hill. Hilltop, a neighborhood in Eighth Ward, was originally settled by Italian immigrants and borders South Greensburg and Underwood on either side. First Ward features Chestnut Hill and Shuey Plan and is also home to Seton Hill University. Other Greensburg neighborhoods include Eastern Estates, Underwood, Shogan, and Hillcrest.

Eighth Ward was originally home to many Italian immigrants from Cercemaggiore, Italy. Today, the original Our Lady of Grace Church, built by the masons from Italy, still stands although used as a residence. The Hilltop Social Club, founded by a few families who lived in the areas of Bierer, Margaret, White, and Catherine Streets, is also located here. Every year it has become a tradition for the firehall in the Eighth Ward to throw a carnival which includes bingo, amusement rides, and the locally-known Shuey Burgers, a relatively simple combination of a freshly grilled hamburger and fried, caramelized Vidalia onions.

Two neighborhoods have been designated as U.S. historic districts, the Greensburg Downtown Historic District and the Academy Hill Historic District. Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places are the Greensburg Railroad Station and Westmoreland County Courthouse.

== Economy ==

Originally a railroad stop on the Pennsylvania Railroad, Greensburg quickly became the center of the coal mining industry in the region by the late 19th century when large areas of soft coal were discovered nearby. This contributed to the growth and development of the growing county seat. Many businesses and inns flourished within Downtown Greensburg for many years and once boasted four major department stores – JCPenney, Royers, Sears and its largest department store, Troutman&#x27;s.

In August 1965, Greengate Mall opened west of the city in Hempfield Township. Greengate was part of the first wave of indoor shopping malls in the country. The mall&#x27;s opening marked a new era for retail shopping in the area. However, it negatively impacted stand-alone businesses in Greensburg&#x27;s downtown corridor. By the late 1970s, several local stores, including Troutman&#x27;s, the city&#x27;s major department store, closed. The downtown area eventually rebounded as the city became a center for service industries, professional offices, and banking. Today, small downtown shops and a growing number of restaurants are reviving downtown as a mercantile center.

Westmoreland Mall and the attached Live! Casino Pittsburgh is the largest shopping and entertainment complex in the Greensburg area and Westmoreland County. Greengate Mall suffered losses in the 1990s when anchor store JCPenney relocated to Westmoreland Mall. As the mall continued on its irreversible decline, the nationally based Montgomery Ward and the regional chain Horne&#x27;s also closed. The building was eventually razed in 2003, and a new shopping center called Greengate Centre, anchored by a Walmart, was subsequently built. Numerous shopping plazas and dining establishments also line the Route 30 corridor east and west of the city. With over of retail space and growing, Greensburg is considered the commercial center of the Laurel Highlands region of Pennsylvania as well as one of the largest retail markets in Western Pennsylvania.

Light to moderate industry and service industries thrive in the Greater Greensburg area. Several industrial parks are primarily located outside the city limits. Housing growth continues on the city&#x27;s northern end, with the Saybrook Village and Evergreen Hill plans. 

=== Major employers ===
Three major corporations are headquartered in the Greensburg area: Excela Health, Hillandale Farms and the &quot;Tribune-Review&quot;. Nearly 300 employees of the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry work in the State Office Building on North Main Street.

== Arts and culture ==

Greensburg is a major cultural center in Western Pennsylvania. It is the home of the Westmoreland Museum of American Art, which specializes in American Art circa 1750–1950. In the heart of the city&#x27;s emerging cultural district, the Palace Theatre is the site for various performances throughout the year. Additionally, it is the home of the Westmoreland Symphony Orchestra and the Summer Sounds Concert Series at the Robertshaw Amphitheater in St. Clair Park.

The Westmoreland Cultural Trust has played a major role in the revitalization of Downtown Greensburg in recent years. Its accomplishments include the renovation of the Palace Theatre and the Train Station. They are also responsible for renovating several commercial buildings in the downtown area. Stage Right! also contributes to the region&#x27;s culture, offering classes in musical theatre for young people and staging professional productions at the Palace Theater and Greensburg Garden and Civic Center. Greensburg Civic Theatre, one of the few long-established volunteer-based community theatre organizations in Westmoreland County, has been presenting both adult and children&#x27;s theater productions for over 60 years. Founded in 1951, they are the resident theatre company at the Greensburg Garden and Civic Center. The Performance Arts Center of Seton Hill University opened its doors to the public in September 2009. This multimillion-dollar complex, located in the city&#x27;s Cultural District, is expected to serve as an additional catalyst for the future growth of the downtown core.

A hands-on science center, to feature a wide range of interactive exhibits, was proposed for the former Mellon Bank building downtown. However, it has since been put on hold indefinitely. The Discovery &amp; Interactive Science Center (DISC) would have been a regional attraction for Westmoreland, Fayette, Indiana, Somerset, and Bedford counties. It would have also been the only interactive science center between the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh and the Harsco Science Center in Harrisburg.

The World Conference Center for The Church of Jesus Christ is located west of Greensburg on PA Route 136. It is the third-largest branch of the Latter Day Saint movement. The national headquarters of the Kappa Delta Rho fraternity is in Greensburg. The Saint Emma Monastery (founded 1931) is a Catholic retreat house and monastery for the Sisters of Saint Benedict located in Greensburg.

== Government and politics ==
Greensburg is an incorporated city governed by Democratic mayor Robert L. Bell and a four-member City Council. The mayor and the City Council members serve four-year terms. The seat of government is the Greensburg City Hall.

The small size of Greensburg has not deterred it from being a player on the political scene. Greensburg has hosted its share of prominent politicians over the years, including a July 1994 visit from then-President Bill Clinton, former Democratic candidate John Kerry and his running mate John Edwards in July 2004 and Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in March 2008 and Joe Biden in September 2020. According to local historians, it was also the site of the 1854 National Republican Party convention – the first convention of the Grand Old Republican Party, despite Pittsburgh&#x27;s claims.

=== Military ===
Greensburg is home to the 14th Quartermaster Detachment, a United States Army Reserve unit. During the Gulf War, the unit took the heaviest casualties of any Coalition unit during the war when an Iraqi missile hit a US Army barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, on February 25, 1991. The 69-member unit suffered a casualty rate of 81%, including 13 killed. Greensburg&#x27;s community was heavily affected by these losses. A memorial to the 14th&#x27;s personnel was constructed at the city&#x27;s US Army Reserve Center. There is also a National Guard Armory just outside the main City.

In recent years, Seton Hill has begun to expand into the downtown area by constructing several academic buildings and a performing arts center. The Greensburg campus of the University of Pittsburgh was founded in 1963 in Downtown Greensburg. It would later grow into a large campus in nearby Hempfield Township. It was voted &quot;Best University in the Region&quot; for eight straight years (1999–2007) by the &quot;Tribune-Review&quot;.

== Professional sports ==

===American football===

From 1890 until 1900, Greensburg was the home of the Greensburg Athletic Association, one of the earliest professional football teams. The team began as an amateur football club in 1890 and was composed primarily of locals before several paid players were added for 1895. In 1894 it was discovered that the team had secretly paid formerly Indiana Normal (now Indiana University of Pennsylvania) player, Lawson Fiscus, to play football and retained his services on salary. The team was the chief rival of another early professional football team, the Latrobe Athletic Association.

On December 3, 1898, two players from the Greensburg Athletic Association joined with the Latrobe Athletic Association to form the very first professional football all-star team for a game against the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, to be played at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Exposition Park. Duquesne went on to win the game 16–0.

Aside from Fiscus, the Greensburg Athletic Association included several of the era&#x27;s top players, such as: Charlie Atherton, George Barclay, Ross Fiscus, Jack Gass, Arthur McFarland, Charles Rinehart, Isaac Seneca and Adam Martin Wyant. Several of these players revolutionized the game during their playing careers. Charlie Atherton is credited with inventing the place kick, and George Barclay invented the first-ever football helmet. Meanwhile, Isaac Seneca became the first Native-American to earn All-American honors and Adam Wyant made history by becoming the first professional football player to be elected to the United States Congress.

===Baseball===
In 1907, Greensburg fielded the Greensburg Red Sox, a Minor League Baseball team in the Class D Western Pennsylvania League that played for one season in 1907. Then from 1934 until 1939, Greensburg was also the home of the Greensburg Red Wings, a Class D Minor League Baseball team was affiliated with the St. Louis Cardinals, Brooklyn Dodgers and Washington Senators. The team&#x27;s name changed several times over the years. In 1934, the team was founded as the Greensburg Trojans. A year later, they took on the Red Wings moniker. By 1937, the team was renamed the Greensburg Green Sox and finally the Greensburg Senators in 1939.

<text>Herminie is a census-designated place (CDP) in Sewickley Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 856 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Herminie (pronounced &quot;hurr-many&quot;) is named for Herminie Berwind, whose husband, Charles Berwind, was President of the Ocean Coal Company. The first mine at Herminie, known as the &quot;Ocean No. 1 Mine,&quot; was opened in 1893 by Berwind-White Coal Company, of which Ocean Coal Company was a subsidiary. Fifty double houses were built for miners, plus five single-family houses for managers on Church Street. By 1900, the mine employed 271 people.

Herminie was the scene of two major strikes. During the Westmoreland County Coal Strike of 1910–1911, miners were evicted from company-owned houses, which were used to house strikebreakers, predominantly southern Blacks. The strike was unsuccessful from the strikers&#x27; perspective. Another strike, this in 1922, resulted in recognition of the United Mine Workers union.

Ocean No. 1 Mine closed in 1938 due to water problems, although other mines in the nearby area continued operating.

<doc id="134151" wikidata="Q1187079" url="?curid=134151" title="Jeannette, Pennsylvania">
<text>Jeannette is a city in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 8,780 at the 2020 census. Jeannette was founded in 1888 and named after Jeannette Hartupee McKee, the wife of one of the city&#x27;s founders, H. Sellers McKee. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
Perhaps the oldest historical reference to the area that became Jeannette is the role the area played in the Pontiac War in 1763. The Bushy Run Battlefield marks the spot where Colonel Henry Boquet led the British and American troops to defeat the Indians in a battle on the 5th and 6 August that year. This victory is credited with helping to prevent the capture of Fort Pitt, and it served the purpose of reopening communication and supply lines. Today, this historical landmark is the site of a museum, nature trails, picnic areas, and an annual reenactment of the Battle of Bushy Run.

First incorporated as a borough on June 7, 1889, Jeannette earned the nickname as &quot;the glass city&quot; in recognition of the numerous glass plants founded in the area, with those factories contributing to the city&#x27;s original stature as the first large manufacturing town in Westmoreland County. In fact, the impact of the glass industry was so significant that the city&#x27;s name actually comes from Jeannette E. Hartupee McKee, the wife of H. Sellers McKee, a local industrialist who cofounded the Chambers and McKee Glass Works and was a member of the elite South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club of Johnstown Flood fame. Mckee and his partner J.A. Chambers also have the distinction of naming Jeannette&#x27;s main street, Clay Avenue after their financial backer, Richard W. Clay. On January 1, 1938, Jeannette became a third class city with Attorney John M. OConnell as the first mayor.

At times, there were as many as 7 significant factories operating in the city of Jeannette including some of the most well known in the history of the glass industry. Names like Jeannette Glass; Fort Pitt Glass; the Pittsburgh Lamp, Brass and Glass Company; American-Saint Gobain, Westmoreland Glass; and others all supplied the country with everything from plate glass windows, to bottles, to milk glass, and much more for many decades. Some estimates over the years indicate that Jeannette once produced somewhere between 70 and 85% of the world&#x27;s glass. Unfortunately, Jeannette&#x27;s glass industry was one of the early United States industry victims of cheap, foreign competition that made it less expensive to produce glass overseas and today only two glass factories remain in the city.

Jeannette&#x27;s manufacturing history doesn&#x27;t end with the glass industry. Today&#x27;s Elliott Company represents an evolution dating back to 1914 when William Swan Elliott moved his company to Jeannette. The Elliott Company, owned by the Carrier Corporation from 1957 until 1979 and by United Technologies Corporation until a 1987 buyout that returned the company to a privately owned status, only to become an Ebara Corporation subsidiary in 2000, has always had a solid reputation in the dynamo, turbine, and large rotating equipment industry. In 1952, the company produced the first diesel-engine turbocharger used in a racecar and subsequently built more than 40,000 more of them for other diesel applications. Throughout the 1970s, local residents routinely witnessed a revolving door of trains hauling parts into the plant on North 4th Street and hauling the huge turbine engines back down the tracks. Today, the Elliott Company is the city&#x27;s largest employer. Jeannette is also the manufacturing home of Jensen Steam Engine Mfg. Co., Inc., which produces small working models of steam engines and turbines. The Jensen shop is only a few blocks from the Elliott plant.

Monsour Medical Center was a 100-bed hospital when it opened in Jeannette, Pennsylvania, in 1958. The Hospital was state-of-the-art in its day, but later fell into financial trouble and was closed in the early 2000&#x27;s.

In 2018, the Elliott Company was approved to purchase the former Jeannette Glass site and expand their operations to downtown Jeannette. The facility could become operational by 2020.

The Pennsylvania Rubber Works, which moved to Jeannette from Erie, Pennsylvania, around 1903, was yet another key part of the city&#x27;s significant industrial base. Not only did this factory become a significant supplier of play balls (basketballs, footballs, tennis balls, etc.) and carpet underlay as part of General Tire in its later years; but the original Pennsylvania Rubber Works provided products for Jeeps and gas masks during World War II.

<text>Laurel Mountain is a borough that is located in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 185 at the time of the 2000 census. 

Situated at the foot of Laurel Mountain (elev. 2,800 ft.), the borough lies near numerous limestone caves and is surrounded by venues for skiing, hiking, and other outdoor activities.

==History==
On July 28, 1769, Richard and Thomas Penn obtained the land where the community of Laurel Mountain would ultimately be located. Purchased from members of the Iroquois Confederacy as part of a larger acquisition encompassing a major portion of what is, today, southwestern Pennsylvania, the price was ten thousand dollars.

During the early nineteenth century, Alexander Johnson obtained a patent from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which transferred ownership to him in 1815 of a 724-acre portion of this same area, including the section that would later become Laurel Mountain. Roughly three decades later, on May 27, 1843, Joseph Naugle purchased 283 acres of the 724-acre segment, and built a home there, paving the way for the creation of a new community.

By the early 1900s, that community had become a place of retreat for business and civic leaders seeking summer vacation homes outside of the city of Pittsburgh. On September 1, 1944, Laurel Mountain Park, Inc. was chartered and empowered to oversee operation of the growing community&#x27;s recreational facilities.

On December 21, 1979, the Westmoreland Court of Common Pleas approved the incorporation of Laurel Mountain as a borough. The first borough council was subsequently established in January 1982.

<doc id="134154" wikidata="Q785105" url="?curid=134154" title="Ligonier, Pennsylvania">
<text>Ligonier is a borough in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,513 at the 2020 census. Ligonier was settled in the 1760s. The borough is well known for nearby Idlewild Park, one of the oldest amusement parks in the country; and nearby Seven Springs Mountain Resort. Another tourist attraction is Fort Ligonier Days, a parade and craft market that takes place every fall over the course of three days, and the Ligonier Country Market in the summer months. Ligonier is part of the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Ligonier is the site of a reconstruction of Fort Ligonier, an example of a frontier fort of the French and Indian War. Ligonier is also known for its downtown square, the Diamond, which has a bandstand in the middle.

==History==
In 1758, when British forces launched a major campaign to remove French forces from the forks of the Ohio, now Pittsburgh, this spot on Loyalhanna Creek was the site of their westernmost camp before reaching the Ohio. The British maintained a large army, a virtual moving city of 6,000 people, that temporarily made Ligonier the second-most populated spot in Pennsylvania, second only to Philadelphia. Fort Ligonier was named after John Ligonier, a British noble of French origin who held the rank of Field Marshal in the British Army. Eventually, the name of the settlement that grew up around the fort was shortened to Ligonier.
In 1817, the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh Turnpike was completed, a gravel road that was the precursor to today&#x27;s US Route 30. Fort Ligonier was a logical place for travelers to break their journey, and with such commercial opportunities in mind, a local resident named John Ramsay (sometimes spelled Ramsey) laid out the street plan, including the space now known as the Diamond. He initially called the town Ramseytown, later changed to Wellington (after the Duke of Wellington), and finally the name was changed to Ligonier. Several decades of prosperity followed. On April 10, 1834, Ligonier was incorporated as a borough.

However, in 1852 the Pennsylvania Railroad was completed, which bypassed Ligonier and passed through the towns of Bolivar and Latrobe instead. Traffic shifted from horse-drawn vehicles to the railroad, causing the community&#x27;s population to drop to 350 according to the 1860 census.

Ligonier benefited when the Ligonier Valley Railroad was completed in 1877, linking the community to Latrobe where connections to the Pennsylvania Railroad were possible. The Ligonier Valley Railroad enabled lumber, coal, and quarried stone to be transported out of the Ligonier Valley, which spurred development of the town. Additionally, the railroad made it easier for Pittsburgh residents to visit Ligonier, causing the town to develop as a summer resort. Some major physical changes to Ligonier occurred during this period. In 1894, the Diamond, which had been used as a corral for horses and wagons, was transformed into a park with a bandstand. A large hotel, the Hotel Breniser, was built in 1900 where the town hall currently sits. In 1909–1910, the Ligonier Valley Railroad built an ornate station and headquarters building, which still stands at 339 West Main Street.

In 1952, the Ligonier Valley Railroad ceased operation, due to a combination of overlogging, decline of the coal industry, and the loss of passenger traffic to motor vehicles.

The Pittsburgh, Westmoreland and Somerset Railroad also served Ligonier from 1899 to 1916, although it did not enjoy the success of the Ligonier Valley Railroad.

Ligonier has three listings on the National Register of Historic Places: the Fort Ligonier site at 216 South Market Street; the Ligonier Historic District, which encompasses the Diamond and the oldest parts of the borough; and the demolished Ligonier Armory.

Ligonier and its surrounding countryside are strongly associated with the Mellon banking family, who still owns considerable tracts of land in the area. The Huntland Downs estate, near Ligonier, comprises some of land and is the centerpiece of the Mellon land holdings in the region.

==Media==
Ligonier is served by two media markets: Pittsburgh and Johnstown-Altoona.

<text>Lower Burrell is a city in northern Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Allegheny River. Located approximately 18 miles northeast of downtown Pittsburgh, it is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The population was 11,758 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
The region in which Lower Burrell is located was originally part of the hunting reserves of the Iroquois. Permanent European settlement began in the 1760s, and Westmoreland County was created in 1773. In 1852, due to an increase in population in the area, Burrell Township was carved out of Allegheny Township on court order of Judge Jeremiah Murry Burrell. In 1879 Burrell Township was divided into two separate townships, Lower Burrell and Upper Burrell. The present-day cities of New Kensington and Arnold were once part of Lower Burrell Township. In the years that followed, Lower Burrell transformed from a quiet, rural farm community to a residential and commercial area while Upper Burrell stayed primarily rural. Upper Burrell Township is still somewhat rural, though it has experienced some suburban growth and sprawl in recent years.

In 1959, in the midst of the growth of their community, township residents voted to make Lower Burrell a third class city. Lower Burrell continued to grow substantially until the 1980s. Like many communities in Western Pennsylvania, Lower Burrell suffered economic and population stagnation with the collapse of local heavy industry. Since the early 1990s, Lower Burrell experienced slight growth, though one of its only large shopping centers remains mostly vacant. Preliminary data from the 2010 census shows that Lower Burrell has lost about 5 percent of its population since 2000.

The Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 4 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

==Geography==
Lower Burrell is located at (40.583966, -79.721948).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (2.28%) is water.

Informally, the city is divided into different neighborhoods and areas including Bon Air, Braeburn, Braeburn Heights, Central City, Edgecliff, Gladeview, Indian Fields I &amp; II and Kinloch. Lower Burrell&#x27;s central Business District overlaps Bon Air-Central City-Gladeview neighborhoods.

Lower Burrell is located in the Appalachian Plateau, the western portion of the Appalachian Mountain range. The landscape varies greatly, with large swaths of flat land (typically in Bon Air, Central City and Gladeview) to areas with gentle slopes, and even steep cliffs and hillsides in certain areas. The city is bounded on the north and southwestern corner by the Allegheny River. Jacks Island, a river island approximately in length, is located near the Braeburn neighborhood.

<doc id="134161" wikidata="Q1186680" url="?curid=134161" title="Monessen, Pennsylvania">
<text>Monessen is a city in southwestern Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States, located along the Monongahela River. The population was 6,876 at the 2020 census. 

Steel-making was a prominent industry in Monessen, and it became a third-class city in 1921. With restructuring of the steel industry in the later 20th century and loss of jobs, it is considered a Rust Belt borough in the &quot;Mon Valley&quot; of southwestern Pennsylvania. Monessen is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, the Rivers of Steel National Heritage Area, as well as the Laurel Highlands. It sits across the Monongahela from the city of North Charleroi.

==History==
===19th century===

Named for the Monongahela River and the industrial German city of Essen, Monessen was created by land speculators fairly late in the history of the Mon Valley, after neighboring towns had already been settled. The East Side Land Company bought land from various farmers, laid out the streets, and then sold the lots to prospective residents and employers. James M. Schoonmaker, who made his fortune in coke, owned a controlling interest in the land company. Other investors in the land company who were also memorialized in street names include Philander C. Knox, James H. Reed, H. Sellers McKee, George O. Morgan, and George B. Motheral. In May 1897, National Tin Plate Company, founded by William Donner, began building its mill, thus becoming Monessen&#x27;s first employer. Sales of lots began on July 27, 1897, for the general public and other employers. Monessen became a borough on September 3, 1898.

===20th century===
Monessen experienced rapid growth in the first two decades of the 20th century; the population increasing from 2,197 in 1900 to 11,775 in 1910 and then to 18,179 in 1920.

While there were many companies operating in Monessen, the largest employer was Pittsburgh Steel Company, later renamed Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel. Pay often was determined by ethnic background. For example, a Welsh immigrant would be paid more than an Italian immigrant. A normal workweek was 84 hours with seven-day work weeks of 12 hours a day. Employers did not adopt the eight-hour workday until the 1920s.

Monessen&#x27;s status changed from borough to city on September 16, 1921.

Beginning in the middle to late 1960s, the region&#x27;s manufacturers, especially the steel industry, found it harder to compete, which led to employee layoffs. In 1972, the closure of Page Steel and Wire Company was a major setback to the city. A far greater blow to Monessen occurred when its largest employer, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel, closed nearly all its Monessen operations in 1986. The company&#x27;s rail mill did not close until March 1987. The mill&#x27;s closure marked the end of an era in Monessen&#x27;s history.

The city has made efforts for several years to clean up abandoned properties in hopes of revitalizing the city. In January 2010 the first female mayor, Mary Jo Smith, was sworn in at the Monessen Municipal Building. Older residents know the steel mills will not be returning to the area. Younger residents barely remember the mills or are even unaware of the city&#x27;s industrial past. &quot;I remember when they tore the blast furnaces down&quot; in the mid-1990s, said one resident. &quot;It was a big deal. My dad took me. I was 5.&quot;

===21st century===
The Charleroi-Monessen Bridge was built in 1906 and demolished in 2011. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 and has yet to be removed from the register. Monessen is rich in its Military Veterans who fought in WW1, WW11 Korea, Vietnam and the Gulf wars. There are many Military War Memorials and Veterans Plaques in the City. Some of the well known ones are the WW1 Lady Victory Memorial in the Eastgate section of town, the Honor Roll at the City Park that includes all the names of those from Monessen who served in the Military, The WW11 Sherman Tank Memorial in the City Park as well as the Capt John Onderko Memorial Walking Track, The Lt Col Edward D’Alfonso Memorial Amphitheater, SP4 Robert Lhota Memorial Picnic Shelter, George Milika Memorial Picnic Shelter and the Anthony Madison Memorial Picnic Shelter. Monessen boasts a War Veterans Memorial Trust to maintain all these memorials in perpetuity. Monessen was home to the following Veterans Organizations; the Monessen Veterans Council, Disabled American Veterans post 131, Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 1190 and American legion Post 28.

==Geography==
Monessen is located at (40.154271, -79.882779). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (4.90%) is water.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Monessen has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.
===Surrounding and adjacent neighborhoods===

<text>Mount Pleasant is a borough in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. It stands 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Pittsburgh. As of the 2020 census, the borough&#x27;s population was 4,245.

The Borough of Mount Pleasant, consisting of the town area, should not be confused with Mount Pleasant Township, which is an entirely separate municipality. Mount Pleasant Township is predominantly rural and adjoins the borough to the north.

In the past, Mount Pleasant was a center of an extensive coke-making industry. Other products included flour, lumber, iron, glass, foundry products, etc.

==History==


Mount Pleasant borough is located at what was originally the junction of two Native American paths. With the coming of Europeans, those two paths - now known as Pennsylvania Routes 31 (east/west) and 819 (north/south)- became key access roads to the western wilderness and more populated areas in the east. The crossroads attracted settlers who established businesses to serve travelers passing through.

The year of Mount Pleasant&#x27;s first non-Native American Indian resident is not known. The road pioneered by the Braddock expedition passed through the western end of the future town in 1755, opening the area to settlement. One source states that at the time of the American Revolutionary War, there was a settlement of &quot;not more than a half dozen houses.&quot; In 1793 Michael Smith was licensed to operate an inn, which would have served traffic on Glades Road (sometimes spelled Glade Road), now Route 31. In 1797, Nathaniel Marshall sold land to Andrew McCready, who laid out the design of the town.

Jacob&#x27;s Creek Bridge, the first iron-chain suspension bridge built in the United States, was erected south of the town in 1801. It was demolished in 1833.

Unfortunately, no pre-1800 structures remain within the borough limits. The borough&#x27;s three oldest existing buildings all date from approximately 1812: The &quot;Shupe House&quot; at 201 Main Street, &quot;Hitchman House&quot; at 355 Main Street, and the &quot;Rupert Building&quot; at 642-644 Main Street.

Mount Pleasant became a borough on February 7, 1828.

Glass manufacturing was a foundation of the local economy, with Bryce Brothers commencing operations in 1850, and L. E. Smith Glass in 1907. The invention of the Bessemer process of steelmaking in 1859, which required coke (fuel), had a dramatic impact on the region. The town prospered as coal deposits were developed, from which coke was made. However, the lives of coal miners in the outlying &quot;patch towns&quot; (company-owned mining towns) were arduous, and labor-management disputes became frequent. The strike in Morewood, west of Mount Pleasant borough, was the most violent of the area&#x27;s strikes, in which nine miners were killed by sheriff&#x27;s deputies on April 3, 1891.

Mount Pleasant was disadvantaged when the main lines of the railroads bypassed the community in the 1850s. The community&#x27;s isolation lessened in 1871 with the opening of the &quot;Mount Pleasant and Broadford Railroad&quot;, later part of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. In addition, a branch line of the Pennsylvania Railroad connected the borough to Scottdale, and West Penn Railways (an interurban trolley) served Mount Pleasant from 1906 to 1952.

The Borough of Mount Pleasant has three listings on the National Register of Historic Places: the Samuel Warden House (1886) at 200 South Church Street, the demolished Mount Pleasant Armory, and the Mount Pleasant Historic District, which encompasses the oldest parts of the borough.

<text>Murrysville is a home rule municipality in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 21,006 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==

The Haymaker Gas Well in Murrysville was the nation&#x27;s first commercial natural gas well. For some time, it remained the largest commercial gas well in the world. The well was drilled in 1878, and until a gas pipe line was attached to the well in 1883, approximately 35 million cubic feet of gas a day was released into the atmosphere, resulting in a total of about 60 billion cubic feet of natural gas released into the atmosphere from this single site Murrysville was described in the first half of the 20th century as being &quot;the center of a district dotted with gas wells, the first of which was bored in 1878; wild speculation in leases precipitated the open conflict known as the &#x27;Haymaker Riots,&#x27; named for the speculator killed in one of them.&quot;

Since 1933, Murrysville has had a &quot;tree sign&quot; spelling out the word &quot;Murrysville&quot;. The trees were landscaped to grow and form the letters by local Boy Scouts. The sign is situated on a large hill as one enters the Municipality from the Murrysville–Monroeville border, near U.S. Route 22. In 1947, the sign was featured in &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It Or Not&quot; as the world&#x27;s largest arboreal sign. (It is no longer the world&#x27;s largest). The &quot;Y&quot; in the Murrysville sign points to the Haymaker Gas Well.

In 1977, Murrysville was designated the &quot;Gateway to Westmoreland County&quot; by Mayor Walt Dollman in conjunction with the Chamber of Commerce. In 2012, community leaders upgraded sign and landscaping elaborately at the main entrance at the Allegheny / Westmoreland border featuring this designation. As is shown at the introduction of this page, the Gateway designation is featured on the official Seal of the Municipality.

Murrysville became a home rule municipality in August 1976, when its electorate voted for a Charter designating it a Municipality.

==Government==
Murrysville is governed by a mayor (currently Regis J. Synan) who is elected every two years and has executive/administrative powers, and a seven-member council, whose members are elected every four years and have precise legislative powers.

In the mid-1970s, as suburban growth began to occur, the community rapidly transitioned through three forms of government (township, borough, and home rule) and four legal name changes (Franklin Township, Franklin Borough, Murrysville Borough, and Municipality of Murrysville). Since 1976, it has operated under its Home Rule Charter as the Municipality of Murrysville.

On Dec. 6, 2023, Murrysville Council approved gas fracking beneath its two largest parks, Duff and Murrysville Community Park, over the objections of at least 174 residents who petitioned Council. No plan was presented for using the incoming money from the leases. Council member Jason Lemak pointed to fracking operations around the Beaver Run Reservoir “We’re talking about parks, but there has been fracking going on for a long time below the water supply for us and 120,000 people,” he said.

On Dec. 18, 2023, the Municipal Authority of Westmoreland County issued a mandatory water conservation order for Murrysville and others, including energy companies using water from the Beaver Run Reservoir for fracking, due to an ongoing drought. In the Department of Environmental Protection’s 2021 Climate Change Impacts Assessment, it is noted that precipitation patterns are expected to change over the next century. Those changes are likely to include more extreme and intense rainfall — something scientists already have reported noticing — and increased drier weather in between and drought, along with higher temperatures. “In general, we expect worse drought over most of the U.S. as a result of human-caused warming, and Western Pennsylvania is no exception,” said Michael Mann, a professor and director of the Penn Center for Science, Sustainability and the Media at the University of Pennsylvania and author of “Our Fragile Moment.” 

==Education==
Murrysville is part of the Franklin Regional School District. The district operates four schools: Franklin Regional Primary School, Franklin Regional Intermediate School, Franklin Regional Middle School, and Franklin Regional High School, with Dr. Gennaro Piraino as the district&#x27;s superintendent. The district&#x27;s high school boasts a graduation rate of 99.3% compared to the national average for public high schools of 82% and is ranked #213 in Newsweek&#x27;s 2016 &quot;America&#x27;s Top High Schools&quot;. Private schools include Mother of Sorrows Catholic School. The Free Gospel Bible Institute (FGBI), a Holiness Pentecostal bible college, is located in Murrysville.

<text>New Kensington (known locally as New Ken) is a city in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 12,170 at the 2020 census. It is situated along the Allegheny River northeast of Pittsburgh and is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
Like much of Westmoreland County and surrounding areas, the region was a hunting ground for American Indians of the Six Nations. White settlement began in the mid-1700s. Continental army troops built Fort Crawford, near the mouth of Pucketa Creek, in 1777. The fort was abandoned in 1793.

Originally part of Burrell (and later Lower Burrell) Township, the city of New Kensington was founded in 1891. In 1890, the Burrell Improvement Company considered the advantages of the level land south of its home in Lower Burrell, and deemed it a prime location for a city and named the area &quot;Kensington&quot;; this was later changed to &quot;New Kensington&quot; for postal reasons, to avoid confusion with the Philadelphia neighborhood of the same name.

In an attempt to make New Kensington comparable to Pittsburgh, the streets were named with numbers. Avenues ran parallel to the river, while streets were perpendicular. The main commercial streets were 4th and 5th avenues.

Once the land was surveyed, a public sale was held on June 10, 1891. Thousands of people flooded the area and investors began bringing industry with them. The first large company was the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, which later became Alcoa. It acquired a property that allowed the company to utilize the riverfront. The Alcoa facility remained operational until 1971.

Eventually, other companies such as Adams Drilling, Goldsmith and Lowerburg, New Kensington Milling, New Kensington Brewing, Logan Lumber, Keystone Dairy, and many more were built late in the 19th century and continuing into the early 20th century. Early achievements included a railroad station, the 9th Street bridge, a passenger boat that navigated the Allegheny River, a street car line that ran to Natrona via the West Penn Railways, the &quot;Kensington Dispatch&quot; newspaper, a fire department, hotel, opera house, and a local chapter of the YMCA. New Kensington annexed the independent borough of Parnassus in 1939.

In 1941, New Kensington became the site of a modern workers&#x27; housing project—named the Aluminum City Terrace—designed by Marcel Breuer and Walter Gropius, which set new standards for federal housing design. Breuer and Gropius ascribed to the famous Bauhaus School of Design in Germany. Intended for Alcoa defense workers, it was subsequently used to rehouse displaced residents from other parts of the city. In 1948, tenants from the Terrace decided to purchase the housing project from the U.S. government to form a co-op, managed by a board of directors, elected by representatives from the 250 units. Relatively low-cost monthly fees continue to cover the costs of running the Terrace.

Today, New Kensington contains the neighborhoods of Parnassus, Mount Vernon, Valley Heights, Valley Camp, Pine Manor, and 40 Acres.

The New Kensington Downtown Historic District, New Kensington Production Works Historic District, and Mount St. Peter Roman Catholic Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Climate==
New Kensington has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;) climate, with cold, snowy winters, and warm to hot summers.

Recreational facilities operated by the city include Memorial and Masa Harbison parks. People&#x27;s Library of New Kensington offers public library services. Public transportation is provided by the Port Authority of Allegheny County and Westmoreland County Transit Authority. The Westmoreland County Housing Authority administers the Kensington Manor, East Ken Manor, and Valley Manor public housing projects within the city limits.

There are over thirty churches representing several denominations throughout the city.

Two radio stations, WMNY and WBZZ, are both licensed to New Kensington, and serve the Pittsburgh radio media market.

Since the 1970s, the city&#x27;s downtown has been plagued by high vacancy rates. Starting in 2008, the New Kensington Redevelopment Authority moved to condemn and demolish abandoned commercial and residential properties. The city has also instituted a Weed and Seed urban renewal program, and provided tax abatement to businesses located or opened in designated Keystone Opportunity Zones.

==Education==
The city is served by the New Kensington–Arnold School District, with facilities at Valley High School, Valley Middle School, H. D. Berkey Intermediate School; and Greenwald Memorial, Fort Crawford, and Martin elementary schools. Budget shortfalls forced the closure of Greenwald Memorial and Fort Crawford in 2015. Valley Middle School was renamed Roy A Hunt Elementary. Greenwald Memorial, sold by the school district to the Roman Catholic diocese of Greensburg, became the new location of St. Josephs School.

Parochial schools include Mary Queen of Apostles and Harvest Baptist Academy (K–12). Former Catholic parochial schools, now consolidated, include: Mount St. Peter, St. Mary, and St. Joseph.

A branch campus of Pennsylvania State University was established in New Kensington in 1958. Since 1966, it has been located in suburban Upper Burrell Township, but retains the name &quot;Penn State New Kensington&quot;. In 2008, a satellite campus of Westmoreland County Community College opened in downtown New Kensington.

==In popular culture==
New Kensington is featured in P.O.D.&#x27;s &quot;Youth of the Nation&quot; music video. The PA Route 56 Arnold directional sign is visible as the car in the video travels eastbound over the 9th Street Bridge, also known as the C.L. Schmitt Bridge.

The city was also one of the filming locations for the movie &quot;Dogma&quot;, starring Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.

==Economy==
Volkswagen of America operated the Westmoreland Assembly Plant, in neighboring East Huntingdon Township from 1978 to 1988. &quot;Westmoreland,&quot; as VWoA called the facility, manufactured the Volkswagen Rabbit, Rabbit truck, Golf, and Jetta. With the downturn of VWoA&#x27;s sales in the US, the plant was closed on July 14, 1988, and VWoA sold the plant to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It remained dormant until 1990, when Sony announced it would begin manufacturing televisions at the site. The facility employed more than 6,000 by mid-1981 and still over 3,000 people by the late 1990s; however, that number dwindled to just 250 by 2007. On December 9, 2008, the Governor of Pennsylvania announced that Sony planned to close the facility. As of 2010, the plant remains idle, the largest block of commercial space available in Western Pennsylvania.

UPS has a major sorting operation, processing about 500,000 packages daily off-peak and 1,000,000 during peak season (November and December) and employing approximately 1,700 workers. The building is spread over 49.6 acres and contains about 327,000 square feet—or about seven football fields.

SuperValu has its Pittsburgh grocery distribution center in New Stanton, close to I-70, exit 57. Over 500 persons are employed here, serving Shop &#x27;n Save, Save-A-Lot, and County Market stores.

<text>North Huntingdon Township is a township in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 31,847 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Named after England&#x27;s Earl of Huntingdon, Huntingdon Township was founded on April 6, 1772, in Pennsylvania.

Huntingdon&#x27;s boundaries started at the mouth of Brush Run where it emptied into Brush Creek. The area is approximately 26 square miles (67 km2)with the Township maintaining about 125 miles (200 km)of roads. If these roads were placed end-to-end, they would stretch from North Huntingdon to Cleveland, Ohio. The boundaries, following along Byerly&#x27;s Path to Braddock Road, continued to the lines that mark Mount Pleasant, Tyrone and Pitt Townships. Huntingdon Township was later divided into the townships North Huntingdon, East Huntingdon, South Huntingdon and Sewickley. Around this same time, Westmoreland County, where North Huntingdon is located, became the townships of Fairfield, Donegal, Mount Pleasant, Hempfield, Pitt, Tyrone, Springhill, Menallen, Rostraver and Armstrong.

Many Native American tribes inhabited this area before the European settlers. The Alligewe Indians are believed to be the first people to live in this area. After this tribe, there were also the Shawnee, Seneca, Cornplanter and Delaware, also known as Lenni Lenape, tribes. The first white man did not come along until 1662.

Arnold Viele, a Dutch trader from Albany, New York was the first white man to enter this territory. Viele had wanted to establish Indian trading posts that were closer to other communities. In doing this, he persuaded the Shawnee tribe to move near the Potomac and Susquehanna Rivers. After Viele, James Le Tort, Andrew Montour, Conrad Weiser and George Croghan were some of the other settlers to move to North Huntingdon.

Many different European groups settled in this area. Two of them were the German and Scottish-Irish immigrants. In the late 1670s, North Huntingdon Township was settled from both the eastern and western ends. This section is divided but what is now known as Irwin. The Germans settled in the east and to the west was the Scottish-Irish settlement. In the German settlement, the Lutheran church ran the schools, and they exclusively taught the German language. The Scottish-Irish settlement was Presbyterian. This group settled mostly in the areas of Circleville, Cavitt&#x27;s Mills and Robbin&#x27;s Station.

The settlers wanted to provide their children with some education in their new homes. Farmers donated land so they could have schools for their children that weren&#x27;t far from home. The schools were made with logs and a clapboard roof. Established in 1782, Birch Spring School was the first school in the township. It was also called Master Jack&#x27;s school after its first teacher. Teachers did not have to meet many requirements to get the job. They had to pass an exam and have a basic knowledge of reading, writing and math. They also had to know how to mend quill pens and wield birch rods. Another school named Fairview was built in 1816. This school was used in the eastern end of the township, while Master Jack&#x27;s school was used in the western end. Today, Norwin Middle School is located in the area.

Schools were not the only thing that these settlers built. They also made their homes. The homes were about 10 feet (3m) high with only one room and one window. They had to use mud for insulation against the cold winters. Chairs were made of logs and beds were stuffed with hay or straw. There was a hole in the roof, instead of a chimney, to let cooking smoke out of the house.

About a century after the German and Scottish-Irish settlers, the Township&#x27;s population was recorded as 3,000 in 1860. According to a census taken in 1980, North Huntingdon Township was the second largest municipality in Westmoreland County with 31,517 residents. Another census in 2000 recorded that the population was down to 29,123 people.

The Fullerton Inn and Andrew and Jennie McFarlane House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Scottdale is a borough in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States, southeast of Pittsburgh.

Early in the 20th century, Scottdale was the center of the Frick coke interests. It had steel and iron pipe mills, brass and silver works, a casket factory, a large milk-pasteurizing plant, and machine shops; all of the aforementioned are presently defunct. Scottdale is notable for its economic decline from a formerly prosperous coke-town into an archetypal Rust Belt town. Duraloy Technologies, &quot;a supplier of specialty high alloy, centrifugal and static cast components and assemblies&quot; is the last remnant of Scottdale&#x27;s steel related prosperity.

In 1900, 4,261 people lived in Scottdale; in 1910, the population increased to 5,456; and in 1940, 6,493 people lived in Scottdale. The population was 4,384 at the 2010 census. Scottdale is located in the Southmoreland School District.

==History==
===1770s-1900: Early history===

It is difficult to identify when the first non-Indian settler arrived in what is now the Borough of Scottdale, although the area witnessed an influx of Scotch-Irish immigrants in the late 1770s. In the mid-19th century, part of the present-day townsite was the location of a distillery, flour mill and post office known as Fountain Mills.

The Pennsylvania Railroad and Baltimore and Ohio Railroad each built branch lines through the community in the early 1870s. With the coming of the railroads, the community’s economy shifted from agriculture to manufacturing and mining. Two brothers who were local farmers, Peter and Jacob Loucks, realized the impact the railroads could have on the area and laid out a small townsite consisting of 24 lots, which went on sale in 1872.

The borough was originally named Fountain Mills, a reference to several mills that were operated in the borough. Scottdale was incorporated as a borough on February 5, 1874 and at that time named in honor of Thomas A. Scott, who had been president of the Pennsylvania Railroad and served as Assistant Secretary of War during the Civil War. Because Scottdale sits atop major coal deposits, the community flourished due to the surrounding coal mines, as well as ovens for converting coal into coke (fuel). The H. C. Frick Coke Company, controlled by Henry Clay Frick, was headquartered here. Scottdale’s factories in the early 20th century also produced iron pipe, tin, knives, steam engines, and caskets.

Scottdale has two sites on the National Register of Historic Places: Scottdale Armory (1929) at 501 North Broadway Street, and the Scottdale Historic District, which encompasses the oldest parts of the borough.

The oldest extant building in the borough is the &quot;Jacob Loucks House&quot; at 115 Walnut Avenue, built in 1853. Otherwise, the borough’s oldest residences are concentrated on Loucks Avenue, where many houses date from the 1880s. As well, three downtown retail buildings can be dated to approximately 1880: 101 Pittsburgh Street, 143 Pittsburgh Street, and 4-10 South Broadway Street.

The West Overton Museum in Scottdale is the only pre-Civil War village still intact today in Pennsylvania. It was named to the National Register of Historic Districts in 1985 as an outstanding example of a 19th-century rural industrial village complete with farm, two floors of the Overholt Mill/Distillery, industrial tools, Blacksmith Shop, a wash house and a smokehouse. It is a stop on the American Whiskey Trail

===1900-1968: Economic prosperity===

Scottdale was home to 30,000 coke ovens in the early 1900s. These coke ovens were operated by hundreds of mining companies, this was due to Scottdale&#x27;s location on the Pennsylvania Railroad which allowed these companies to ship coal and coke to major cities across the United States. Many of these mines were affected greatly by the Great Depression in 1929, leading to several of their closures.

The Coal and Coke Bike Trail in Scottdale was opened on the former route used by the Pennsylvania Railroad to ship coal and coke from Scottdale to Mount Pleasant. It encompasses five and a half miles of abandoned railroad and is maintained by volunteers from the Coal and Coke Chapter of the Regional Trail Corporation.

After the events of the Great Depression, new industrial work began to arise. One in particular, Duraloy Technologies, was opened sometime in the 1920s. Duraloy became the first company in the United States to create heat resistant alloys used for creating metal products. The company remains opened in its original building as of July 2024.

In 1900, The Geyer Performing Arts Center opened on Pittsburgh Street. It was originally an opera house and hosted vaudeville performances. In 1912, the building was sold and renamed The Scottdale Theater and was converted into a movie theater. The building changed hands once again in 1926 and renamed The Strand. The Strand was one of the first theaters to be equipped with a system that allowed for films with sound to be introduced. The Strand closed in 1969. With its reopening in April 1987, the theater shifted to stage theater performances, which it still holds as of June 2024. The Geyer has also been home to stand up comedy acts as well as concert performances.

===1969-present: Proposed mall construction and fallout===

In 1969, Scottdale attempted an urban renewal project by building a mall. The mall was set to be located on Pittsburgh and North Broadway Streets in downtown Scottdale with a two pump gas station next-door. The development was to be equipped with several chain stores such as Giant Eagle and a Thorofare store. To prepare the site, new sidewalks, wiring and sewer lines were completed by June 1970.

By December 1970, the area was still not developed, with much of the businesses on the left side of Pittsburgh street being torn down to make room for the shopping plaza. Lanes of travel to access the area were left unpaved and only one lone bid had been accepted on space in the plaza, that being for the gas station that was to open next-door. Funding for the project began to run out with Scottdale&#x27;s borough council refusing to give funding until buyers for lots began to show interest. The budget for a parking lot would be approved of in December 1971.

The mall continued to develop into September 1972 with one more bid being placed on space within the proposed plaza. Progress was finally made on the plaza in October 1974 when the borough signed a contract with a Uniontown based company to begin building on the site. By 1975, the mall project ceased, bringing the six year ordeal to an end.

On Saturday, May 1, 1976, the area of the former would-be mall was dedicated as a park. In the park, a gazebo was erected as well as three flagpoles. A walkway was also introduced to access the park from Pittsburgh Street. In the decades since the failed mall project, Scottdale has opened a Rite-Aid Pharmacy, a YMCA Pool, public library and Veteran Memorial in place of the former development.

Scottdale has also used the space annually for their Fall Festival. Since 1973, the Scottdale Fall Festival has hosted multiple outdoor vendors, music performances and an annual parade which is participated in by local businesses as well as high school groups such as the Southmoreland football team and marching band. The Fall Festival is also where Southmoreland High School&#x27;s homecoming king and queen are crowned.
In the years following the failed mall construction, Scottdale has seen an economic decline. Approximately 2,000 of its residents are employed as of 2022 with a majority being in health care or retail work. 14.3% of Scottdale residents are below the poverty line with a median household income of just over $53,000. The borough also has an unemployment rate of 7.4%, which is 1.4% higher than the national average.

In 2022, the former Greystone Manor, once used as a department store, was purchased. Built in 1905, the building sat abandoned for decades where it deteriorated. With the purchase, $2 million in renovations have been made to restore the building.

==Education==
In 1805, the first schoolhouse in the area was built adjacent from Gaut’s Dairy Farm in rural Scottdale, near Alverton. The first school board for the district was established on September 19, 1834. The district began to expand and several more buildings were added before being split into two districts; Scottdale School District and East Huntingdon School District.

The Scottdale school district opened as multiple schools throughout the borough including North, Central and South grade schools. The original high school building was constructed in the late 1800s on the site of present day Chestnut Street Park. The building was demolished in 1901 and replaced by a new school building directly across the street the same year. With the advent of the new school building, Scottdale&#x27;s student body became known as the &quot;Scotties&quot; and began using the Scottish Terrier mascot with white and blue colors to represent the district. A football field was constructed behind the school building leading to the school instituting sports teams for the first time.

By the 1952 school year, Scottdale High School began to be outgrown by the student body as well as merging with nearby Upper Tyrone School District, leading to a new building being developed. The new site, located North Chestnut Street, for the renamed Scottdale Joint High School was purchased on June 22, 1953. The building was first used for a Scotties basketball game in January 1958 with the school officially opening for instruction on September 3, 1958.

In the fall of 1964, Scottdale and nearby East Huntingdon School District merged to form Southmoreland School District with students from Scottdale Joint High School now attending classes at Southmoreland High School in Alverton. The former Scottdale Joint High School building was renovated into Southmoreland Elementary and Middle School in 2010.

About 5.7% of families and 14.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 34.8% of those under age 18 and 18.3% of those age 65 or over.

==History==
Slickville is best known for its unusual name, tied to its history. Like many other Appalachian mining communities, Slickville was named for a mining official: Donald Slick. Slickville was planned by the Cambria Steel Company, the successor of the Cambria Iron Company, built by the Midvale Steel and Ordnance Company in 1917 and acquired by Bethlehem Steel in 1923. It included many of the amenities not found in older company mining towns, such as single-family housing and indoor plumbing in all single houses. It also benefited from a relatively large &#x27;downtown&#x27; area shared between it and the adjacent towns of Jamison (or Elrico) and nearby Patton.

Slickville&#x27;s heyday lasted until 1942 when the mine was closed; however, it retains most of its original company housing, along with the company store, mine car repair shop, mine office (with jail in the basement), grade school (closed in 1985), four churches (including St. Slyvester&#x27;s Catholic, Presbyterian Church, Holy Ghost Ukrainian Orthodox, Baptist (closed circa 2000), &#x27;boney&#x27; pile and official&#x27;s houses including the superintendent&#x27;s house. While most original company housing remains in good condition, several smaller &#x27;cottage&#x27; houses have been removed. Several downtown area business buildings are now either private residences or have been removed. This includes the removal of the former Ukrainian association building, which later became the civic center around 1995, the Nickolas Kitch confectionery store around 2005, and Nick Zerebnick&#x27;s barbershop around 2010.

The Pennsylvania railroad last ran through town in the late 1950s; however, the railbed from Slickville to Saltsburg was made into a hiking trail in the fall of 2007 and extended to near Delmont in roughly 2011 (with plans to extend this trail to Trafford and an eventually link with the Great Alleghany Passage trail system in Braddock). The ballfield was redone with help from the Slickville Lions around this time.

Since the closing of the five Slickville mines by 1942, the nearby Patton and Jamison mines in the 1950s, and the near total abandonment of mining of high sulfur coal in the area since the 1980s, Slickville has benefited economically from its proximity to other cities in the area. These include service manufacturing jobs in locales, such as Greensburg, Jeannette, Latrobe, and eastern Pittsburgh area suburbs. As of 2007, Slickville was still beyond the outer edge of East Pittsburgh suburban housing developments, although suburban areas such as Murrysville are only roughly five miles away.

<doc id="134181" wikidata="Q1180625" url="?curid=134181" title="Smithton, Pennsylvania">
<text>Smithton is a borough in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 399 at the 2010 census. As of 2018, the population was listed at 378. Smithton has its own post office, with zip code 15479, and is serviced by Yough School District.

==History==
In approximately 1801, a mill, known as Smith&#x27;s Mill, was built at the location which became Smithton Borough. The town was incorporated as a borough in 1901. Smithton&#x27;s early industry was in coal mining, coke ovens, and the transportation of goods produced in the valley of Jacobs Creek.

By 1906, four schools were located at Smithton, with 4 teachers serving 144 students. William B. Jones (grandfather of actress Shirley Jones) founded The Jones Brewing Company at Smithton in 1907. The company brewed Stoney&#x27;s Beer in Smithton until 2002, when the brewing operation was moved to Latrobe, Pennsylvania.

==Geography==

Smithton lies within the Laurel Highlands of the Allegheny Mountains (&quot;the Alleghenies,&quot; colloquially). The Highlands are recognized today for their popularity among tourists, who travel from across Pennsylvania and beyond to visit the mountains, waterfalls, and recreational sites. The Great Allegheny Passage (the GAP), a 150-mile bike trail that connects Cumberland, Maryland and Pittsburgh via the Alleghenies, was built in the late 1900s and runs through the town of Smithton. The GAP is considered a &quot;Rails to Trails&quot; bike path, as it follows the area&#x27;s historically prominent railroad passages. Smithton continues to be heralded as a Western Pennsylvania &quot;trail town&quot; because of its geographic proximity to commercial transit (Amtrak), industrial (CSX), and now, recreational, use of these railroad passages. A bridge along Pennsylvania Route 981, referred to as the Smithton Low-Level Bridge, offers passage from the railway and bike path, on the western side of the Youghiogheny River over to Smithton, on the east side of the river.

<text>South Greensburg is a borough in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,117 at the 2010 census.

==History==

===Early history===

In 1780, Michael Rugh acquired title to , which he operated as a farm. The land was passed on to his son, Jacob Rugh, and later to Jacob&#x27;s son, Peter Rugh. The Rugh family house is still extant at 1213 Broad Street. The current building dates from the Civil War, but was built on the foundation of a much older structure. The area was known as Rughtown, although it was not yet a town in any meaningful sense.

In the 1870s, a local industrialist, George Franklin Huff, bought of the Rugh farm. In 1881, this was sold to Greensburg Coal and Coke Company (later Keystone Coal and Coke Company), which established a mine and brickyard along Broad Street. Fifty workers&#x27; houses were built in 1888. During this time, the community was known as Huff, Hufftown, or, Pennsylvania Huff&#x27;s Station.

A trolley line was constructed in 1890 along Broad Street, running north into Greensburg. This line was later acquired by West Penn Railways, which operated trolley service until 1952.

In 1891, the community was incorporated as the Borough of South Greensburg.

===Coal strike of 1910-1911===

The borough was the scene of violence during the Westmoreland County Coal Strike of 1910–1911. In July 1910, a group of striking coal miners were authorized to conduct a protest by the borough&#x27;s Chief of Police, William B. Keltz. A confrontation ensued between the marchers and security personnel working for Jamison Coal and Coke Company. In the resulting melee, one miner, Peter Gale, was shot by J.A. Willis, who was a member of the company&#x27;s security forces. Chief Keltz attempted to arrest the shooter and instead was arrested himself by constables under Jamison&#x27;s control.

===Walworth Valves===

For nearly a century, South Greensburg&#x27;s largest employer was Walworth Valves. This factory began in 1888, as the Kelly &amp; Jones Company (John T. Kelly and George M. Jones), and Huff was a member of their board of directors. Walworth Company purchased the facility in 1925. The factory filled a large plot of land bordered by (using current street names) Route 30 Bypass, South Main Street, Huff Avenue, and the railroad. Including adjacent properties used by the company, this industrial complex covered and had 1500 employees at its height. The factory closed in 1980 and was later demolished. The site is now occupied by the Wellington Square office building and various commercial businesses.

<text>Southwest Greensburg is a borough in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,155 as of the 2010 census.

==History==

In 1769, John Peter Miller was granted provisional ownership of land within the current-day boundaries of Southwest Greensburg, and he received full ownership rights in 1789. Miller was told that the first settler traditionally has the right to name a community, and when Miller was asked what name he preferred for the area, he responded with &quot;What you please?&quot; As a result, the community - at that point a mere collection of farms - bore the unusual name &quot;What You Please?&quot; for many decades, in what was undoubtedly an expression of settlers&#x27; sense of humor.

In 1887, Richard Coulter and George Franklin Huff, both of whom had attained wealth in the local coal industry, saw the possibilities of developing the area as a residential community. Coulter and Huff purchased land from a farmer, John Mace, in 1887, and a community consisting of 413 lots was laid out. The first recorded use of the name &quot;Southwest Greensburg&quot; occurred in 1888, when Coulter and Huff&#x27;s plan was submitted to the county courthouse.

Southwest Greensburg was incorporated as a borough on November 15, 1890. The first borough election was held on February 17, 1891, in which John Putnam was elected as the borough&#x27;s first burgess (mayor), together with other borough officials.

A key element of the community&#x27;s development was the Greensburg &amp; Hempfield Street Railway, which built a trolley line on Greene Street in 1890. Shortly afterward, the company built an amusement park called &quot;Electric Park&quot; to increase trolley traffic. The boundaries of &quot;Electric Park&quot; were (approximately) Greene Street, Main Street, Welty Street, and Weaver Street. Nothing of &quot;Electric Park&quot; remains, which was eventually redeveloped as residential lots. The trolley line was later acquired by West Penn Railways and operated until January 3, 1937.

<doc id="134187" wikidata="Q7893828" url="?curid=134187" title="Unity Township, Pennsylvania">
<text>Unity Township is a township in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 21,724 at the 2020 census, a decline of approximately 4% compared to the 2010 census.

The township is home to Saint Vincent Archabbey, College and Seminary, as well as Arnold Palmer Regional Airport. The Norfolk Southern Railway (once part of the Pennsylvania Railroad mainline) runs through the northern section of the township.

==History==
Unity Township was incorporated on September 23, 1789. Initial records show settlement going back to 1760. Residents of Mount Pleasant Township petitioned the court to establish a new township around the area next to the Loyalhanna creek, based on the inconveniently large size of the existing township, which made it necessary to travel long distances to conduct township affairs. One of the oldest communities in the township was Youngstown, an important stop in the wagon and stagecoach era, ca. 1818–1852, which became a separate borough in 1831.

The township is home to Unity Cemetery, which was established in 1774. Some 15,000 people are believed to buried in the cemetery, including Colonel John Proctor, 31 other Revolutionary War veterans, U.S. Congressman William Findley and television host Fred Rogers.

In 1847 the Sisters of Mercy, an Irish Catholic order, established St. Xavier&#x27;s Academy for Girls in Unity. In time, it expanded to include a convent. The buildings were destroyed by a fire in 1972, but the sisters&#x27; cemetery on the former school grounds in Unity remains.

For a time the coal industry &quot;dwarfed all others&quot; in the township, according to historian John Boucher, writing in 1906. Mines which once operated in Unity Township included those named Carney, Humphries, Dorothy, Marguerite, Mutual, Puritan (in Baggaley), Whitney, Jamison No. 20 (in Pleasant Unity), Hostetter, Beatty and St. Vincent&#x27;s Shaft. Many of them were constructed in the period 1880 to 1900. All have long since closed. Extensive land remediation has taken place and few traces of the mines remain, but their names survive in township neighborhoods and streets.

Carr&#x27;s Tunnel, an abandoned railroad tunnel, is located in Unity Township. Locally known as Witches&#x27; Tunnel, it is on a now-dismantled spur of the Pennsylvania Railroad which serviced coal mines in the area, including the Carney mine.

The Kingston House and St. Vincent Archabbey Gristmill are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 67.3 square miles (174.2 km), of which 67.1 square miles (173.8 km) is land and 0.2 square mile (0.4 km) (0.24%) is water.

The township contains the following communities: Baggaley, Beatty, Carney, Denison, Donohoe, Dorothy, Dry Ridge, George&#x27;s Station, Greenwald, Hostetter, Humphreys, Lawson Heights, Lloydsville, Lycippus, Manito, Marguerite, Mutual, Old Crabtree, Pleasant Unity, and Whitney. To the west lies Hempfield Township; to the east, Latrobe Borough and Derry Township.

<text>Upper Burrell Township is a township in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States, within the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The population was 2,159 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Northern Westmoreland County was once part of the hunting grounds of the Iroquois Five Nations, first settled by Europeans in the 1760s. In 1852, Allegheny Township, which covered nearly all of the northeastern corner of Westmoreland County, was divided into smaller districts to accommodate a growing population. One of these became Burrell Township, which in 1879 was divided into Lower and Upper Burrell townships. In the 1890s, Lower Burrell was further divided into the cities of New Kensington and Arnold. Farming, coal mining, and milling were the mainstays of the local economy in the 19th and early 20th century. There are several historic buildings from that era still standing in Upper Burrell Township; the Byerly House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

<text>Vandergrift is a borough in Westmoreland County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, approximately northeast of Pittsburgh. Early in the 20th century, it had the largest sheet steel mill in the world.

On June 28, 1915, the Borough of Vandergrift Heights was consolidated with Vandergrift. In 1900, 2,076 people lived here; in 1910, 3,876. The 1915 consolidation almost doubled Vandergrift&#x27;s population when Vandergrift Heights added approximately 3,438 new residents (1910 population). By 1940, 10,725 people lived in Vandergrift. The population was 5,455 at the 2000 census, and 5,205 in 2010.

==Etymology==

Dutch (Van der Grift): topographic name from Middle Dutch grifte ‘man-made channel&#x27;, a surname subsequently adopted by the Van der Grift family who served as the town’s mayors for five consequent generations.

==History==

In the 1890s the Apollo Iron and Steel Company was in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, ending a bitterly contested labor dispute at its Apollo, Pennsylvania, steelworks by hiring replacement workers from the surrounding countryside. To avoid future unrest, the company sought tighter control over its workers, not only at the factory, but also in their homes. Drawing upon a philosophy of reform movements in Europe and the United States, the company&#x27;s leader, George McMurtry, adopted what was later known as welfare capitalism, with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers, and providing a benign physical environment and good housing, to make for happier and more productive workers. Wanting a loyal workforce, McMurtry developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital&#x27;s treatment of labor.

In 1895, Apollo Iron and Steel built a new, integrated, non-unionized steelworks and hired the nation&#x27;s preeminent landscape architectural firm, Olmsted, Olmsted and Eliot, to design the model industrial town, to be named Vandergrift (for Capt. J.J. Vandergrift, a director of the steel company). The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a novel combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry&#x27;s skilled workers and led to McMurtry&#x27;s greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift&#x27;s worker-residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation.

<text>West Newton, located southeast of Pittsburgh, is a borough in Westmoreland County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Formerly, the manufacture of radiators and boilers were the chief industries. The population was 2,633 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
The town traces its roots to 1788, when a group of American pioneers to the Northwest Territory led by Gen. Rufus Putnam traveled overland from Massachusetts and stopped at this location to build boats. They then set out down the Youghiogheny River to the Monogahela and Ohio Rivers, ending their journey and founding the town of Marietta, Ohio. Former names of the town are Simeral&#x27;s Ferry (also, Sumrill&#x27;s Ferry), Oswegly (Sewickley) Old Town, and Robbstown. Eighteen miners lost their lives in West Newton in 1901 at the Port Royal Mine.

The Dick Building and Plumer House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Like many pioneer towns in Western Pennsylvania, West Newton earned its early historical relevance by playing a key role in the westward expansion of the United States. The Simerals were the first family to operate in this area and operated a small ferry on the Youghiogheny River halfway between Connellsville and McKeesport. A New Jersey native and whiskey rebel named Isaac Robb, laid out the town of West Newton; however, it was originally called &quot;Robbstown&quot;. The town grew slowly as the community served as a trading outpost where the Old Glades Indian trail met the Youghiogheny River.

West Newton&#x27;s fortunes changed during the mid 19th century. River commerce increased with the construction of slack water dams in the 1830s. The introduction of the Pittsburgh, Connellsvile, and Markles Paper Mill provided early economic developments.

Despite facing devastating fires, floods and tragic train wrecks in the 20th century, the people of West Newton persevered, continuing to develop both the infrastructure and economy of their community. West Newton eventually transitioned into a bedroom community with a vast majority of residents working outside of the borough&#x27;s limits. The community saw new economic life blood, serving as a trail town along the Great Allegheny Passage for visitors around the world.

<text>Youngstown is a borough in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. Youngstown was incorporated on April 2, 1831. The population was 326 at the 2010 census. The borough has its own post office, with zip code 15696, established on April 1, 1813.

==History==

The town was named after Alexander Young, whose first lot was recorded November 25, 1815, in the Recorder&#x27;s office of Westmoreland County. There was a dispute to the name of the town over if it should be called Martinsburg or Youngstown. The name Youngstown was settled upon after it was found that a town of Martinsburg already existed in the Commonwealth. James Keenan&#x27;s recorded plan of land on April 3, 1816, recorded the town as Youngstown Borough. As the community grew, and more people settled in the area, the citizens formed a political government. The residents petitioned the legislature in Harrisburg to form Youngstown Borough out of their lands. Governor George Wolf approved act No. 168 of 1830, on April 2, 1831. This act erected Youngstown, in the County of Westmoreland, into a Borough. Act No. 168 laid out the borough lines, and provided for elections of the burgess and other town officials, and stated the duties of the officials. As the town progressed, the residents felt themselves restricted by the Act of 1830 and petitioned Westmoreland County Court of Quarter Sessions to become subject to the Act of April 3, 1851. The Act of 1851 provided for more modern borough government than that permitted by the previous special act of legislature. The residents of the borough and their officers did not act quickly, since the petition to become subject to the Act of 1851 was not approved by Borough Council until July 25, 1905.

The opening of the Pennsylvania Government Land Office in the area in 1769, and the contract of the Pennsylvania Proprietaries with the Indians opened up the Loyalhannah Valley for settlement for pioneers, many of whom were of German and Scotch-Irish descent. Christopher Saxman in 1764, and Frederick Pershing in 1769 were the first recorded settlers in the area of present-day Youngstown. As a community and village grew, it was often called Martinsburg, after Martin West, another nearby land owner. Located along the Forbes road, a military road built under the command of Brigadier General John Forbes in 1758, the town became an important rest stop along the east–west route that eventually stretched from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. In 1794, Federal troops passed through and quartered at the town&#x27;s Barrett Hotel on the way to quell the Whiskey Insurrection.

Until 1796, Youngstown, often referred to as Martinsburg, had been randomly settled, with various people making claims to the land. The first recorded transaction of land came on March 31, 1796, when Robert Dickey received a warrant from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for a tract of land known as &quot;Hermitage&quot;. John Moore, a surveyor, pursuant to the warrant, issued a survey showing of land. Robert Dickey conveyed Hermitage to Joseph Baldridge by deed dated February 18, 1797. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, through the offices of Governor Thomas Mifflin, issued a patent to Joseph Buldridge for the tract of land known as Hermitage on April 1, 1797.

Joseph Baldridge, another settler that built a mill in the area, was conveyed a deed for a tract of land known as &quot;Hermitage&quot; in 1797. Lots on the land began to be sold in 1800. Alexander Young recorded the lots sold in 1815, and after a dispute between the names Martinsburg and Youngstown, the town received its name on April 3, 1816. General Arthur St. Clair, who had retired near Youngstown, died near his home there, “Hermitage”, in 1818. The Greensburg-Stoystown Turnpike was constructed along the old Forbes road in 1819, leading to more traffic and prosperity for the borough, which was now the largest town and served as a market place, with taverns, blacksmiths, wagon makers, harness shops and a variety of other merchants, and a post office for the region. The community continued to grow and on April 2, 1831, the citizens formally formed the borough as a political government. J. G. Karns was the first Burgess of Youngstown.

The Pennsylvania Railroad introduced train service through neighboring Latrobe in 1852, leading to a decline as merchants moved closer to the railway and the Greensburg-Stoystown Turnpike was less frequently used. As the automobile became popular, the turnpike became the Lincoln Highway which brought traffic through Youngstown. U.S. Route 30, constructed in the 1930s, bypassed Youngstown, leading it to become a quiet residential community. The Kingston House, a center for trade and commerce and hotel dating from 1800, was listed in the National Register of Historical Places on June 30, 1983.

1769 Pennsylvania Government Land Office opened

1794 Whiskey insurrection - Troops were quartered at the Barrett Hotel

1799-1800 Youngstown Borough laid out

1819 Greensburgh-Stoystown Turnpike completed

1861 Youngstown was an enlistment center for the Civil War

November 9, 1909 Council voted to enter into contract with West Penn Electric Company for placing and maintaining four arc lights on the main street of town.

October, 1916 Council ordered the borough weigh scales removed from Main Street.

March 6, 1918 Council adopted the contract of the State Highway Department for street paving.

August, 1818 - Arthur St. Clair, General in the Continental Army, member of the Continental Congress and the 9th President of the United States in Congress Assembled in 1798, the first Governor of the Northwest Territory, the first Commander of the U.S. Army, 1791–92) died in poverty on the Old State Road between Ligonier and Youngstown, when he was riding a wagon into town and probably had a stroke. He lived on top of the Laurel Ridge in a home and land given to him by his son Daniel. (There is a state marker at the site of his house, the house being torn down many years ago.) Arthur had run an inn where travelers stopped for food and supplies for their horses. His wife Phoebe was an invalid by this time and she died a week later. Both are buried under a Masonic monument in St. Clair park one block from the courthouse in Greensburg. His daughter, Louisa St. Clair Robb, and her six children were living with Arthur and Phoebe as were Elizabeth St. Clair Lawrence (a widow) and her children.

Arthur and his family left Hermitage around 1810, when the property was foreclosed by his creditors and all of his personal and real property was sold to satisfy debts. These debts had been incurred mostly when Arthur St. Clair signed his bond for Indian Treaties as well as other expenses in the Northwest Territory for which Congress authorized the funds, but never appropriated the money, leaving St. Clair without reimbursement. Also, debts due him from funds loaned to the government for the costs of the Revolution were never reimbursed, the government claimed that the statute of limitations had expired!

The old Hermitage house was torn down back in the 1950s and a Mrs. Mellon got word of it and had the parlor severed from the house and trucked to the new location of what would be the Ligonier Museum. The museum was built around the parlor. Mrs. Mellon authorized funds to purchase many of the things that were auctioned in the 1810 foreclosure sale and had them placed in the parlor and also in the collection of the museum. It is said that Arthur told his children to continue to petition the government for their inheritance, and in 1857 Congress appropriated $30,000 (which was a fraction of what was due) to the Arthur St. Clair Memorial, to be divided to the six branches of the family, with each branch receiving $5,000.
