<text>Jackson is a city in and the county seat of Madison County, Tennessee, United States. Located east of Memphis, it is a regional center of trade for West Tennessee. Its total population was 68,205 as of the 2020 United States census. 
Jackson is the primary city of the Jackson, Tennessee metropolitan area, Jackson is Madison County&#x27;s largest city, and the second-largest city in West Tennessee after Memphis. It is home to the Tennessee Supreme Court&#x27;s courthouse for West Tennessee, as Jackson was the major city in the west when the court was established in 1834.

In the antebellum era, Jackson was the market city for an agricultural area based on cultivation of cotton, the major commodity crop. Beginning in 1851, the city became a hub of railroad systems ultimately connecting to major markets in the north and south, as well as east and west. This was key to its development, attracting trade and many workers on the railroads in the late 19th century with the construction of railroads after the American Civil War. Through the 1960s, the city was served by 15 passenger trains daily, but industry restructuring reduced such service and caused the loss of jobs. The economy has adjusted to new businesses, with major manufacturing in the area.

==History==
===Early settlement===

This area was occupied by the historic Chickasaw people at the time of European encounter. They were pushed out by European-American settlers under various treaties with the United States, in actions authorized by the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and ratified by the US Senate.

European-American settlement of Jackson began along the Forked Deer River before 1820, primarily by migrants from eastern areas of the Upper South, such as Virginia and Kentucky. Originally named Alexandria, the city was renamed in 1822 to honor General Andrew Jackson, a hero of the War of 1812. He was later elected as President of the United States.

The City of Jackson was founded by an act of the Tennessee General Assembly, passed in 1821, entitled an &quot;act to establish a seat of justice for Henry, Carroll, Henderson and Madison Counties.&quot; The act required of land to be deeded to the commissioners. The commissioners chosen by the Legislature were Sterling Brewer and James Fentress. The places considered for the seat of justice were Alexandria, Golden&#x27;s Station, and Jackson. The larger portion of the settlers at that time were living on Cotton Grove Road, and as Jackson was closer to them than either of the other settlements, this settlement was determined to be the more suitable site for the seat of justice.

At the time of the second Tennessee State Constitution in 1834, when the Tennessee Supreme Court was established, Memphis had not yet been developed. The county seat of Jackson was the most significant city in West Tennessee and this was designated as a site for the State Supreme Court in this part of the state.

The city of Jackson did not establish public elections until 1837, with a Board of Aldermen elected at-large. From 1854 to 1915, Jackson had a Board of Aldermen of eight members elected from four districts, each with two members elected at-large. Free people of color and freedmen were not allowed to vote in the state until after passage of federal constitutional amendments following the Civil War that granted them citizenship and suffrage.

This area was initially developed for agricultural purposes, especially cotton plantations for producing the chief commodity crop of the Mississippi Valley and Deep South. Cotton plantations were dependent on the labor of Slavery in the United States/enslaved African Americans, and thousands were brought into the area as it was developed. As county seat, Jackson was a trading town and retail center for surrounding agricultural areas.

But developing as a railroad hub of several lines was most important to Jackson&#x27;s industrial and population growth, from 1852 on for the next hundred years.

===Civil War through 19th century===

In 1862 Tennessee came under the control of Union forces and was occupied until General Ulysses S. Grant decided to concentrate his efforts to the South. Between December 11, 1862, and January 1, 1863, an engagement at Jackson occurred during Confederate Brigadier General Nathan Bedford Forrest&#x27;s expedition into West Tennessee. Forrest wanted to disrupt the rail supply line to Grant&#x27;s army, which was campaigning along the route of the Mississippi Central Railroad. If Forrest destroyed the Mobile &amp; Ohio Railroad running south from Columbus, Kentucky through Jackson, Grant would have to curtail or halt his operations altogether.

Forrest&#x27;s 2,100-man cavalry brigade crossed the Tennessee River on December 17. Grant ordered a soldier concentration at Jackson under Brigadier General Jeremiah C. Sullivan and sent a cavalry force under Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll. Forrest&#x27;s command defeated the Union cavalry in Lexington, Tennessee on December 18. As Forrest continued his advance the following day, Sullivan ordered Colonel Adolph Englemann to take a small force northeast of Jackson.

At Old Salem Cemetery, acting on the defensive, Englemann&#x27;s two infantry regiments repulsed a Confederate mounted attack, then withdrew a mile closer to the city. The fight amounted to no more than a feint and show of force intended to hold Jackson&#x27;s Union defenders in position, while two mounted Confederate columns destroyed railroad track to both the north and south of the town, then returned. Forrest withdrew from the Jackson area to attack Trenton and Humboldt after this mission was accomplished.

As a result of the destruction of the railroad, Grant abandoned his plans to invade Mississippi from Tennessee in favor of an attack on Vicksburg, Mississippi, for control of the river. Federal troops left Jackson and moved to Memphis, which became a major center for Union troops for the duration of the war. Forrest returned to Jackson in early 1864 and used the city as his headquarters as his forces attacked Federal positions in northern West Tennessee and Fort Pillow, a Union position on the Mississippi north of Memphis. Forrest returned to Jackson again later that year in preparation for an attack on Federal river traffic on the Tennessee River east of Paris and the supply base at Johnsonville.

With the emancipation of slaves and passage of US constitutional amendments granting suffrage to African-American males, Jackson&#x27;s freedmen and formerly free people of color began to participate in the political system. But secret vigilante groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan, developed chapters in Tennessee and throughout the South that intimidated and attacked freedmen in order to exercise white supremacy. As Reconstruction continued, they worked to suppress the black Republican vote.

In the late 19th century, the white-dominated state legislature passed several laws that made voter registration and voting more difficult, including payment of a poll tax, and resulted in reducing voting by many blacks and poor whites. After Reconstruction, white violence increased against blacks. In 1886, Eliza Woods, an African-American woman, was lynched in Jackson after being accused of poisoning and killing her employer, Jessie Woolen. Woolen&#x27;s husband later confessed to the crime. Two other African Americans were known to have been lynched by whites in Madison County in this period that extended into the early 20th century.

===20th century===
In 1915, Jackson was one of several cities in the state to adopt a commission form of government, changing its electoral scheme to at-large voting citywide for three designated positions: a mayor and two commissioners. This resulted in a government dominated by the majority, with no representatives elected from minority populations. (Other cities to make this change included Clarksville, Chattanooga, Knoxville and Nashville.) Although the state in 1913 enacted a law enabling cities to adopt the commission form of government independently, Jackson was chartered by the state for this change. The commissioners each were allocated specific responsibilities, for instance, for the school system and city departments.

In the late 19th century, the state of Tennessee had already adopted residency requirements, voting process, and poll taxes that sharply reduced the ability of African Americans to register and vote. The City Charter was amended to include run-off elections within two weeks in cases of one candidate not receiving a majority of votes. This created an extra burden on campaigns by less wealthy candidates. In Jackson, the total effect of these changes to the city electoral system was to reduce the ability of African Americans in the 20th century to elect candidates of their choice and to participate in the political system.

In 1977, the former company town of Bemis just south of Jackson, was annexed by the city of Jackson.

In 1977, three city residents filed suit against the city in US District Court, in &quot;Buchanan v. City of Jackson&quot; (1988), (683 F.Supp. 1515), challenging the structure and electoral system of the city government because the at-large voting had diluted the voting power of the city&#x27;s significant minority of African-American residents. (According to the 1980 Census, the city population was 49,074, of whom 16,847, or 34.3%, were black.) Since 1915, no black person had ever been elected to, or served on, the Board of Commissioners. The court found this commission electoral system to be discriminatory in effect. Over the decades, the African-American minority was effectively closed out of city government. The case was appealed and affirmed; the defendants ultimately proposed a new system, approved in 1988 by the court. By a new city charter, in 1989 the city created a Board of Commission based on nine single-member districts for broader representation. The mayor is elected at-large.

Similar legal challenges to the electoral and city systems in Clarksville and Chattanooga led to changes in their city charters to establish more numerous members of a city council or board of commission, to be elected from single-member districts. As a result, more African-American and women candidates have been elected as representatives from those jurisdictions.

The dissolution of the former government in Jackson resulted in the need for an elected city school board, since one of the commissioners had previously managed education. The city commissioners chose to consolidate their school system with that of the Madison County school system in 1990, creating the Jackson-Madison County School Board. This was also done to achieve desegregation goals. The nine-member board is elected from six districts across the county; three districts elect two members each and the other three each elect one member. All members are elected for four-year terms, with elections held on a staggered basis every two years. The demographics of the county in 2012 for major ethnic groups were 60.3% white and 37% African American. In 2008 the school system was still under a court order supervising its desegregation progress.

In the post-World War II era, the railroad industry underwent restructuring and mergers. (See section below). By the end of the 1960s, it sharply reduced passenger service to Jackson; there were related losses of associated industrial jobs supporting the railroads, causing economic problems in the region.

===1999 to present===
Between 1999 and 2008, several violent tornadoes struck large portions of the city. The McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport was severely damaged in January 1999, a storm that resulted in eleven fatalities. The 1999 tornado also damaged the Riverside Cemetery, where 40 known Confederate soldiers, 140 unknowns, and many families of the founders of Jackson are buried. The cemetery&#x27;s acres of old trees and many of the statues, monuments, and graves were damaged during the tornado.

Parts of the Union University campus were damaged in November 2002. The downtown area was devastated in May 2003 by an F4 tornado, and there were eight deaths. Many dormitories at the Union campus were demolished in a storm in February 2008.

On May 1, 2010, a severe thunderstorm hit Jackson, dropping 13 inches of rain in a short period of time. Flash floods destroyed many homes and streets.

===Railroad history===
Jackson developed rapidly just prior to the Civil War as a railroad junction and maintenance shop for several early railroads, including the Mississippi Central, the Tennessee Central and the Mobile and Ohio lines. Located over seventy miles east of Memphis, Jackson lies along the shortest rail route between Cairo, IL; Jackson, Mississippi (Mississippi&#x27;s capital); and New Orleans, Louisiana. As the railroad was extended from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, Jackson, Tennessee was perfectly situated as a station along the north–south line; and, to serve as a junction between the north–south line, and lines east and west between Memphis and Nashville, the major cities of West and Middle Tennessee.

The first was the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, which began in October 1849 in Mobile, Alabama. The line first entered Jackson in 1851. These tracks were completely destroyed during the Civil War. The line merged with the Gulf, Mobile and Northern Railroad in 1940 to become the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad. The second railroad to enter Jackson was the Mississippi Central &amp; Tennessee. In 1873, the line was contracted and later controlled by the Illinois Central Railroad.

On December 29, 1886, the Tennessee Midland Railway received a charter to build a railroad from Memphis to the Virginia state line. The line from Memphis to Jackson was completed on June 1, 1888. In 1893, the Tennessee Midland went into receivership and was sold at foreclosure to the L&amp;N Railroad. &quot;Circa&quot; 1968, the remainder of the Tennessee Midland was abandoned east of Cordova with the exception of some track in Jackson. That track is now used to deliver goods to Jackson&#x27;s east and west industrial parks.

The Tennessee Midland Railway Company line from Memphis to Jackson was the forerunner of the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway. This line was often referred to as the &quot;NC&quot; by locals. Like all other railroads to enter Jackson, it was built with funds subscribed by citizens and investors of Jackson. The first passenger train entered Jackson from Memphis on June 1, 1888. The highly profitable railroad was merged into the Louisville and Nashville Railroad following WWII. Eventually the L&amp;N was merged into, and is now part of, CSX Transportation.

A charter was granted by the State of Tennessee on August 16, 1910, and construction began on July l, 1911. The first sector extended from Jackson to the station of Tigrett, and by April 20, 1912, of the line were ready for operations. On June 16 the remaining sector was set into service, connecting Dyersburg with Jackson. When the line began operations in 1912, its president was Isaac B. Tigrett, a prominent young banker of Jackson. The railroad became an important local thoroughfare, used to transport much of the produce of the region to market in Jackson and Dyersburg. The Birmingham and Northwestern Railway Company had four locomotives, five passenger cars, and 92 freight cars. When Isaac B. Tigrett became President of the GM&amp;N in 1920, he ceased to direct the affairs of the Birmingham and Northwestern Railroad Company. After he became president of the GM&amp;O, the railroad was purchased and merged to become the Dyersburg branch.

===Passenger trains in the 20th century===
Jackson had been a west Tennessee hub for passenger train service. Passengers had direct service to Memphis, Nashville, Meridian, Montgomery, Mobile, Birmingham, Jacksonville, Daytona, Miami, Centralia, Champaign-Urbana, Springfield, Chicago, St. Louis, and New Orleans. From the 1930s to the 1960s, multiple regularly scheduled passenger trains of the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio and the Illinois Central made stops at Union Station.

Gulf, Mobile and Ohio trains included:
*&quot;Gulf Coast Rebel&quot; (St. Louis, Missouri – Mobile, Alabama)
*&quot;The Rebel&quot; (Chicago – New Orleans, Louisiana)

Illinois Central trains included:
*&quot;The City of Miami&quot; (Chicago, Illinois – Miami, Florida)
*&quot;The Floridan&quot; (Chicago – Miami)
*&quot;The Seminole&quot; (Chicago – Jacksonville, Florida)
*&quot;Sunchaser&quot; (Chicago and St. Louis – Miami)

=== Minor League Baseball ===
The Jackson Generals, a Double-A Minor League Baseball team of the Southern League played at The Ballpark at Jackson from 1998 to 2020. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minor leagues after the 2020 season, the Generals were not invited to serve as any team&#x27;s affiliate, effectively ending their run in affiliated baseball. After a legal battle with the city, the Generals ceased operations in 2021 after an arbiter ruled in favor of the city.

Originally known as the West Tenn Diamond Jaxx, the team changed its name to the Generals in 2011. The new name was in reference to the Jackson Generals who played in the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League from 1935 to 1942 and 1950 to 1954. The original Generals were preceded by teams called the Jackson Jays (1926), Jackson Giants (1925), Jackson Blue Jays (1924), Jackson Climbers (1911), and Jackson Railroaders (1903).

With the Generals gone in 2021, the Winnipeg Goldeyes of the independent American Association temporarily moved their operations to Jackson due to COVID-19 restrictions shutting down the US-Canada border, preventing them from playing in their normal home, Shaw Park in Winnipeg. The Goldeyes played 33 games in Jackson before being given permission by the Canadian government to return across the border on August 3.

In 2022, the city of Jackson welcomed back professional baseball in the form of the Jackson Rockabillys of the Prospect League. The Rockabillys play in the city-owned The Ballpark at Jackson, which was previously occupied by the city&#x27;s minor league franchise.

Author William Least Heat-Moon mentions New Hope, Tennessee in &quot;Blue Highways: A Journey into America&quot;&quot;,&quot; published in 1982 by Little, Brown and Company, chronicling the author&#x27;s 12000-mile trip in remote places around the United States. Festival Opera presented Carlisle Floyd’s “Susannah,” July 12 and 14, 2019, at the Lesher Center for the Arts in Walnut Creek, CA. Dubbed as “an American tale of innocence, lust, and social consequence,” the opera centers on the main character, 18-year-old Susannah Polk, a typical teenager entering womanhood in the quiet mountain town of New Hope, Tennessee, when she finds herself bereft of hope as she becomes the target of ruthless and malicious gossip.
== Points of interest ==
Nickajack Dam is located on the eastern edge of New Hope near Hwy 156 on the Tennessee River. It is a hydroelectric facility with four generating units with a summer net dependable capacity of 107 megawatts.

New Hope is home to the Maple View Public Use Area, located adjacent to Nickajack Cave Wildlife Refuge and home to federally endangered bats. In one evening in June 2019, representatives from Tennessee Valley Authority and Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency counted 97,026 bats leaving to feed and returning to the cave. Chattanooga Guided Adventures operates a dusk kayak tour from Maple View to the cave daily between March and October.

New Hope is also home to the Shrine of Our Lady Virgin of the Poor, built by Benedictine monks in 1982 for spiritual contemplation and open to anyone of any faith. The Shrine is located on a 600 acre farm in New Hope and opens from sunrise to sunset every day.

New Hope is home to several large manufacturing and distribution facilities, including Colonial Chemical, Inc. and Lodge Manufacturing Co. Colonial Chemical, Inc. hosts a quarterly TDOT litter pick-up along a two-mile stretch of Highway 156. A $500,000 Appalachian Regional Commission grant will assist with the construction of a rail spur to provide rail service into Nickajack Port Industrial Park in New Hope and enable Colonial Chemical Inc. to move forward with its planned expansion. Groundbreaking for this project was held at Colonial Chemical on April 15, 2022.

In March 2023, it was announced that Red Moon Development, an Arizona-based RV park developer, has shown interest in building a 250 to 400 space facility alongside the Tennessee River, north of Highway 156. A petition critical to rezoning this property for commercial use was circulated among New Hope residents to be presented at a future Town Hall meeting. On July 4, 2023, it was announced that the property for the RV park was &quot;back on the market,&quot; indicating that the developer&#x27;s plans to purchase the land have ceased.

<doc id="135282" wikidata="Q3289503" url="?curid=135282" title="Orme, Tennessee">
<text>Orme is a town in Marion County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 87 as of the 2020 census, down from 126 as of the 2010 census. It is part of the Chattanooga, TN–GA Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Orme is rooted in a coal mining community known as Needmore, which was established in the early 1890s. Mining operations in the valley were slow to develop, however, due to the area&#x27;s remoteness and lack of adequate means of transportation for the coal. In the late 1890s, Chattanooga businessman Frederick Gates purchased the Needmore mining operations, and began negotiating with the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway to build a branch line into the valley. After some hesitation, this railroad agreed to build the line in 1902.

After negotiating the construction of the branch line, Gates sold the Needmore operation to Richard Orme Campbell (1860–1912), who renamed the operation the &quot;Campbell Coal and Coke Company&quot;. He renamed the town of Needmore after his son, who was also named Richard Orme Campbell (the name &quot;Orme&quot; was the maiden name of the elder Campbell&#x27;s mother, Virginia Orme). Along with mining facilities, Campbell built a commissary, an office building, workers&#x27; cottages, schools, and a hotel. Within a few years, the town had grown to several thousand residents.

Campbell sold the Orme operation in 1905, and the new owners renamed the company, &quot;Battle Creek Coal and Coke Company.&quot; By 1912, the operation consisted of four drift mines, some reaching high up the walls of the Cumberland Plateau. Mule-drawn rail cars carried the mined coal to the mine entrances, where it was transferred to a locomotive. The locomotive then carried the coal to an upper tipple, which in turn transferred it to a lower tipple. At its height, the mining operation was shipping 1,000 tons of coal per day out of the valley. The operation was known for its &quot;good coal, inaccessibility, irregular stratification, and consequently difficult mining.&quot;

Following a miners&#x27; strike in 1939, major mining operations in Orme were shut down. The railroad company removed the rails, and the metal was used for ongoing World War II efforts. Afterward, Orme declined. The hotel closed in 1945, the school closed in 1961, and the post office closed in 1970. The wooden railroad depot is one of the few buildings remaining from the town&#x27;s mining heyday.

===2007 drought===

In 2007, Orme was one of the hardest-hit communities in the drought-ridden southeastern United States, due to its dependence on two vulnerable water sources: a waterfall-fed creek and a natural spring that delivered up to 60,000 gallons/day (227,000 liters/day). These sources dried up to only 5,000 gallons/day (19,000 liters/day), not enough to pressurize the supply lines to the town&#x27;s residents. A temporary solution was arranged whereby a truck would haul water to the town providing enough water to keep the system running for three hours each evening. The mayor of Orme, Tony Reames, arranged a permanent solution in the form of a connection to the municipal system of the nearby town of Bridgeport, Alabama. In his words: &quot;It&#x27;s not a short-term solution. It is THE solution.&quot; The connection would be via a pipe between the two towns, paid for by an emergency grant of $377,590 from the USDA. The project was hoped to be completed by the end of November 2007.

==Geography==
Orme (rhymes with &quot;storm&quot;) is located at (35.011361, -85.805175). The town occupies most of the Tennessee portion (i.e., the northern end) of Doran&#x27;s Cove, a narrow valley surrounded on the north, east, and west by the Cumberland Plateau. Most of Orme&#x27;s public buildings and residences are concentrated in a small stretch of bottomland along Dry Creek, the valley&#x27;s primary drainage. The walls of the plateau rise nearly a thousand feet in all directions, the exception being a relatively narrow gap that opens to the south. South Pittsburg, Tennessee, lies across the plateau to the east, and Bridgeport, Alabama, lies to the southeast. Russell Cave National Monument lies just across the state line to the south.

A single paved road, Orme Road, connects Orme to Jackson County, Alabama. To reach Orme via paved road from Tennessee generally requires driving along U.S. Route 72 from South Pittsburg southward into Alabama, and following county roads 75 and 98 northward through Doran&#x27;s Cove (the latter highway becomes Orme Road at the state line). A gravel road, Orme Mountain Road, connects Orme with Tennessee State Route 156 atop the plateau to the north.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

<text>South Pittsburg is a city in Marion County, Tennessee, United States. It is part of the Chattanooga, TN–GA Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 3,106 at the 2020 census. South Pittsburg is home to the National Cornbread Festival.

==History==

What is now South Pittsburg remained a primarily agrarian area until the construction of a branch line of the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad (later the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway) into the Sequatchie Valley in the late 1860s. Small-scale mining operations began during this period. When a post office was opened in 1869, the community was called Battle Creek Mines.

In the mid-1870s, several British investors formed the Southern States Coal, Iron and Land Company, in hopes of establishing a major industrial operation in the Sequatchie Valley. The company dispatched James Bowron to investigate the area for potential town and manufacturing sites. Bowron chose the Whitwell and Victoria areas in northwestern Marion County for the company&#x27;s coal mining and coke production operations, and the Battle Creek Mines area as the company&#x27;s iron production center and commercial hub. The latter site was chosen primarily for its immediate access to both the railroad and the Tennessee River. On May 23, 1876, the name of the Battle Creek Mines post office was changed to &quot;South Pittsburg&quot; in hopes that the city would one day grow to become a great iron manufacturing center like Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The death of Bowron in 1877, along with several other key company officials within a short period of time, halted the Southern States operation. In 1882, the company was purchased by the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company (TCI), which resumed the development of the mining and iron production facilities. In 1886, the townsite of South Pittsburg was purchased by Nashville banker William Duncan, who helped organize the South Pittsburg City Company in December of that year. The town was platted by F.P. Clute, and incorporated in 1887 with John G. Kelly as its first mayor. This revival of the city&#x27;s development roughly coincided with the completion of two large blast furnaces and a foundry, allowing large-scale iron production to begin. South Pittsburg experienced rapid growth in the 1890s, but struggled after TCI relocated to Alabama.

In 1906, the Dixie-Portland Cement Company (later Penn-Dixie) established a cement production center in what was then known as the Deptford area, south of South Pittsburg. The company hired New York insurance executive Richard Hardy to oversee the development of a company town, which became known as &quot;Richard City&quot; after Hardy. After becoming president of the company in 1914, Hardy initiated a major expansion project in Richard City. Many of the town&#x27;s houses, churches, businesses, and even utility poles were constructed using the company&#x27;s cement. The plant operated until 1980, when Penn-Dixie went out of business. The site was later purchased by Vulcan Materials. Richard City was annexed by South Pittsburg in 1985.

==Geography==
South Pittsburg is located at (35.008342, -85.710645). The city is situated in the southwestern Sequatchie Valley between the Cumberland Plateau on the west and the Tennessee River (Guntersville Lake) on the east. Two steep ridges— Whitacre Point on the north and Lodge Point on the south— extend outward from the Plateau to &quot;wall in&quot; the main portion of the city on the north, west, and south. The Richard City area lies opposite Lodge Point to the south, and the Battle Creek area lies opposite Whitacre Point to the north. At an elevation of approximately , South Pittsburg is the lowest incorporated city in the East Tennessee Grand Division.

The city&#x27;s municipal boundaries stretch southward to the Tennessee-Alabama state line. Kimball borders South Pittsburg to the north, and New Hope lies across the river to the east. Chattanooga is located approximately to the east.

U.S. Route 72 passes north-to-south through South Pittsburg, connecting the city with Jasper to the north and Bridgeport, Alabama, to the south. Tennessee State Route 156, which crosses the river via the Shelby Reinhart Bridge, connects the city with New Hope and Haletown to the east, and the Sewanee and Monteagle areas atop the Plateau to the west. Interstate 24 passes through Kimball, just north of South Pittsburg.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==History==
The town that became Whitwell was originally known as Cheekville, but renamed &quot;Whitwell&quot; for Thomas Whitwell, a British metallurgist, inventor and co-founder of the Southern States Coal, Iron and Land Company, who was killed in an accident in his own ironworks in Thornaby in 1878. Whitwell was incorporated as a city in 1956, having grown as a mining town due to the abundance of coal in the mountains near the town. In 1981, there was a major mining accident when 13 coal miners were killed in an explosion. A full list of the names of those killed in the mine explosion is on a monument at Whitwell High School. Whitwell also has an annual Labor Day celebration that has been celebrated for over 50 consecutive years.

== Paper Clips Project ==
Whitwell has become renowned for the Paper Clips Project, a Holocaust memorial and educational project, that was carried out by children of the local middle school starting in 1998. A subsequent documentary was made about the children&#x27;s achievement. This project started because students at the local middle school wanted to visually grasp how much six million was. The students started collecting paper clips, one for every Jew who was murdered in the Holocaust during World War II. This project soon attracted media attention and international support. Many Jewish notables sent paper clips representing lost members of their families. The children collected well over the number of paper clips they wanted (11 million, representing all noncombatant prisoners—Jew and Gentile—killed by the Nazis). The total collected number of paper clips now stands between ten and fifty million. This number is approximately equal to the total number of war deaths between 1939 and 1945. The rail car that appears in the movie is original rolling stock, actually used to transport Jews to the concentration camps. This rail car is located at the Whitwell Middle School. The Middle School routinely hosts Holocaust survivors as well as other guest speakers on the subject of the Holocaust.

==History==
===Formation of Lewisburg and Early History (1807–1836)===
On October 4, 1836, the Marshall County court appointed a committee— which built a county courthouse and jail, which are both known today as the Marshall County Courthouse and the Marshall County Jail. The county court of Marshall County would then sell lots in Lewisburg, some to build houses or for other purposes. Members of the committee were James Osborne, William Williams, Joel Yowell, Aaron Boyd, and James C. Record. When it was formed in 1836, the city of Lewisburg had a land area of approximately 15 square miles Years prior to 1807, no towns or established settlements existed in the area of Marshall County. The territory appeared as an &quot;unbroken wilderness&quot; 

There was white violence against freedmen during and after Reconstruction, extending into the early 20th century. Some lynchings of African Americans took place at the Marshall County Courthouse in Lewisburg during the period of highest violence around the turn of the 20th century. Two unidentified black men were lynched without trial in Lewisburg on August 5, 1903. Another account said that John Milligan (Millikin) and John L. Hunter had been killed in Needmore by a mob that week. They are likely the same men.

Until 1925, Lewisburg served the area principally as a trading and shipping center for its livestock and farm produce. As the county seat, it was a center of the justice system and active as a retail center for the area farmers.

The world headquarters of the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders&#x27; and Exhibitors&#x27; Association has been based in Lewisburg since 1939. The Tennessee Walking Horse, a gaited breed, is considered to have been developed in Middle Tennessee, and the area is still a center of breeding and exhibitions for this horse.

Marshall County is significant partly because of three men who have served as Governor of Tennessee were living here when they were elected to office: Henry Horton, Jim Nance McCord, and Buford Ellington.

==Education==
It is served by Marshall County Schools, including Marshall County High School.

<doc id="135289" wikidata="Q5675279" url="?curid=135289" title="Columbia, Tennessee">
<text>Columbia is a city in and the county seat of Maury County, Tennessee. The population was 41,690 as of the 2020 United States census. Columbia is included in the Nashville metropolitan area.

The self-proclaimed &quot;mule capital of the world,&quot; Columbia celebrates the city-designated Mule Day each April. Columbia and Maury County are acknowledged as the &quot;Antebellum Homes Capital of Tennessee&quot;; the county has more antebellum houses than any other county in the state. The city is home to one of the last two surviving residences of James Knox Polk, the 11th President of the United States; the other is the White House.

== History ==

A year after the organization of Maury County in 1807, Columbia was laid out in 1808 and lots were sold. The original town, on the south bank of the Duck River, consisted of four blocks. The town was incorporated in 1817.

Columbia was the site of Jackson College from 1837 until it was burned, along with most of Jackson, by Union troops during the American Civil War.

Columbia had five documented lynchings in the 20th century. In 1924 a black man was shot and killed in the courthouse after his sentence was commuted, by the brother of his victim. In 1927 and 1933, young black men were lynched in Maury County for alleged assaults against white women; the first, Henry Choate, was being held as a suspect when he was lynched, and was hanged from the courthouse. In 1933 Cordie Cheek, a black 17-year-old, was accused of raping a white girl. After a grand jury declined to indict him, he was abducted from Nashville by white men including law officials, and taken back to Columbia. There he was castrated and lynched by a white mob.

During World War II phosphate mining and the chemical industry expanded in Columbia to support the war effort. By the 1940 census, the total city population was 10,579; more than 3,000 were African American. After the war, chemical plants were a site of labor unrest between white and Black workers, both in terms of competition for work and efforts to unionize. Veterans sought to re-enter the economy, and Black veterans resisted being pushed back into second-class status after having fought in the war. In the postwar period, Black veterans often became leaders in the growing campaign for civil rights during the 1950s and 1960s throughout the state.

Today, the county is a heritage tourism destination, because of its numerous historic sites. Attractions include the President James K. Polk Home, the Columbia Athenaeum, Mule Day, and nearby plantation homes.
For instance, Clifton Place is a historic plantation mansion located southwest of the city on Mt. Pleasant Pike (Columbia highway). Master builder Nathan Vaught started construction in 1838, and the mansion and other buildings were completed in 1839, for Gideon Johnson Pillow (1806-1877) on land inherited from Gideon Pillow.

Columbia is the location of Tennessee&#x27;s first two-year college, Columbia State Community College, established in 1966. President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife Lady Bird Johnson dedicated the new campus on March 15, 1967. On this visit, the President also visited the James K. Polk Home for a short time.

On June 26, 1977, 42 people, including 34 inmates, died in a fire at the Maury County Jail. Rescue efforts were complicated by the fact that each cell required a separate key, and the dispatcher reportedly had difficulty locating the keys. The fire was reportedly intentionally started by a juvenile inmate.

===Columbia race riot of 1946===

On February 25, 1946, a civil disturbance, dubbed &quot;the Columbia Race Riot,&quot; broke out in the county seat. It was covered by the national press as the first &quot;major racial confrontation&quot; following World War II.

In a fight instigated by William &quot;Billy&quot; Fleming, a white repair apprentice, James Stephenson, a black Navy veteran, fought back and wounded him. Stephenson had been on the boxing team and refused to accept being hit. Stephenson had accompanied his mother to the repair store, which had mistakenly sold a radio which she had left for repair to John Calhoun Fleming, Billy&#x27;s father. A white mob gathered during the altercation. The senior Fleming convinced the sheriff to charge both Stephensons with attempted murder.

Rumors were rife that the Stephensons would be lynched. As whites gathered in the square talking about the incident, blacks armed themselves and planned to defend their business district, which they referred to as &quot;the Bottom&quot;. It started about one block south of the square. Later that evening whites drove around the area, shooting randomly into it; they referred to the neighborhood as &quot;Mink Slide.&quot; Armed black men turned out some street lights and shot out others, patrolling the area for defense. Four policemen who entered the area were wounded and retreated, increasing white rage.

Worried that the small police force could not control the mob, the mayor called in the State Guard and the sheriff called in the state Highway Patrol that night. The Guard resisted Patrol requests to arm the white mob. In an uncoordinated effort, the Highway Patrol entered the district early the next morning before a planned time; they provoked more violence and destroyed numerous businesses. Eventually through the next day, they and the State Guard rounded up more than 100 blacks as suspects in the police shootings. No whites were charged at that point. Two black men were killed and a third wounded, in what the police said was an escape attempt while the Highway Patrol was trying to take them from the jail to the sheriff&#x27;s office. The State Guard was withdrawn on March 3.

Twenty-five black men were eventually charged with attempted murder of the four policemen. Another six were charged with lesser crimes, as were four white men. The main attorney defending Stephenson and other men in the case was Thurgood Marshall of the NAACP. He worked with Z. Alexander Looby, who was based in Nashville but associated with the national legal team, and Maurice Weaver, a white civil rights lawyer from Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Marshall asked for a change of venue, hoping to get the trial moved to Nashville or another major city. The judge agreed to move the trial only to nearby Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. Local residents there were unhappy to be involved in the controversial case. Marshall and his team achieved acquittal from an all-white jury for all but two men. The prosecution dropped their charges against these men, as they believed the convictions would be overturned on appeal. The Stephensons were never tried, nor were four Whites charged with murder, nor were several blacks. Of two black men tried for murder, only Loyd Kennedy was convicted in his trial of 1947.

The NAACP continued a publicity campaign about these events, which were also covered by national media. The case gained much attention on the issue of civil rights for African Americans in the United States. The NAACP and other organizations put pressure on President Harry S. Truman to take action to improve the situation. He appointed a President&#x27;s Committee on Civil Rights, which issued its report in October 1947. In 1948 Truman directed integration of the Armed Services by Executive Order 9981, as a result of the report and his consultation with black leaders. Marshall was later appointed as the first black United States Supreme Court justice.

<text>Athens is the county seat of McMinn County, Tennessee, United States and the principal city of the Athens Micropolitan Statistical Area has a population of 53,569. The city is located almost equidistantly between the major cities of Knoxville and Chattanooga. The population was 14,084 at the 2020 census. The population of the zipcode area is at 23,726 

==History==

===Early history and Civil War===
The Cherokee were living in McMinn County at the time of the arrival of the first Euro-American explorers. The Athens area was situated nearly halfway between the Overhill Cherokee villages of Great Tellico to the north in Monroe County and Great Hiwassee along the Hiwassee River to the south. In 1819, the Cherokee signed the Calhoun Treaty, selling the land north of the Hiwassee (including all of modern McMinn County) to the United States. McMinn County was organized on November 13, 1819, at the home of John Walker in what is now Calhoun. The Native American village, Pumpkintown (a corruption of Potemkin town), was located on a farm about two miles east of present-day Athens. It is sometimes incorrectly identified as a forerunner of Athens. Athens was laid out and chosen as the county seat in 1822. The name &quot;Athens&quot; may have been chosen due to perceived topographical similarities to Athens, Greece.

By 1834, the population of Athens had grown to over 500. Prominent early settlers included William Henry Cooke, who operated an iron forge near modern Etowah, and Samuel Clegg (or Cleage), a construction entrepreneur. Jesse Mayfield, whose descendants founded Mayfield Dairy Farms, arrived in the early 1820s. The Hiwassee Railroad received a charter in the mid-1830s to build a railroad connecting Knoxville, Tennessee, and Dalton, Georgia. The railroad began construction in 1837, although financial and legal problems delayed its completion until 1851. In 1836, General John Wool arrived in Athens to help coordinate the Cherokee Removal. Although initially voluntary, the operation became a forced removal in 1838 when many Cherokee refused to leave. The removal culminated in the forced march west that became known as the Trail of Tears. Wool set up his headquarters at the Bridges Hotel, which was located across the street from the McMinn County Courthouse.

McMinn County was divided during the American Civil War. The well-established railroad brought numerous pro-secessionist and anti-secessionist speakers to the county, including Andrew Johnson, Horace Maynard, John Bell, and William &quot;Parson&quot; Brownlow. In 1861, McMinn County voted against secession by a narrow 1,144-904 margin. The county sent 12 units to the Union army and 8 units to the Confederate army. General William Tecumseh Sherman was briefly headquartered at the Bridges Hotel in McMinn County while preparing his &quot;March to the Sea.&quot;

===Post-Civil War===
After the Civil War, the railroad lured business opportunists to McMinn County. In 1887, several investors established the Athens Mining and Manufacturing Company with plans to convert the town into a model industrial community and initiate large-scale mining operations in the area. Textile mills, flour mills, and timber mills dominated the county&#x27;s industry by the late 19th century, complemented by furniture and appliance factories in the 1920s.

In 1946, several McMinn County World War II veterans ran for local office in hopes of removing a county government deemed corrupt. On August 1, local authorities locked themselves in the county jail along with the ballot boxes. Suspecting foul play, the veterans armed themselves in revolt and assembled on a hill across the street from the jail. After an exchange of gunfire, the county authorities surrendered. The ballots were counted, and the veterans&#x27; ticket was elected, ending the Battle of Athens.

==Geography==
Athens is located at (35.448171, -84.602069). The city is situated amidst a series of narrow, elongate ridges and low hills that are characteristic of the Appalachian Ridge-and-Valley Province. The Unicoi Mountains rise roughly east of Athens, and the Tennessee River flows nearly to the west. Starr Mountain, one of the more noticeable ridges in McMinn County, is located roughly southeast of Athens.

Oostanaula Creek (sometimes spelled &quot;Eastanalle&quot; or a similar variation) rises in the hills north of Athens and traverses the city approximately upstream from its mouth along Hiwassee River. Other major streams in the area include Mouse Creek, which parallels Oostanaula to the west, and Chestuee Creek, which parallels Oostanaula to the east.

Athens is centered around the junction of U.S. Route 11, which connects the city to Sweetwater to the north and Cleveland to the south, and State Route 30, which connects Athens to Etowah and U.S. Route 411 to the southeast and Decatur to the west. Interstate 75 passes west of Athens.

<text>Calhoun is a town in McMinn County, Tennessee, United States. It is part of the Athens Micropolitan Statistical Area . The population was estimated at 536 in 2020.

==History==
The area where Calhoun is located was settled by John Walker (c. 1770-1834), a part-Cherokee grandson of Nancy Ward and a prominent figure in the formation of McMinn County. Walker helped contract the Cherokee Turnpike Company in 1808 to maintain a road between Knoxville and Georgia. What is now Cahoun began around 1808, when Walker established a ferry across the Hiwassee River between the present locations of Calhoun and Charleston. In 1819, Walker helped negotiate the Calhoun Treaty, where the Cherokee ceded the remaining lands between the Hiwassee River and the Little Tennessee River to the U.S. government. That same year McMinn County was organized at Walker&#x27;s home in Calhoun. In 1820, Walker laid out the town of Calhoun, which he named for John C. Calhoun, the Calhoun Treaty&#x27;s chief U.S. negotiator. Walker&#x27;s son, John &quot;Jack&quot; Walker Jr., would eventually be assassinated by two anti-removal Cherokees, who felt he had betrayed the Cherokee Nation.

Joseph McMinn, governor of Tennessee from 1815 to 1821, spent the last few years of his life in Calhoun, and is buried in the Shiloh Presbyterian Cemetery, which is located in Calhoun.

In 1954, the pulp and paper giant Bowater (now Resolute Forest Products) established a plant in Calhoun that soon grew to become one of the largest newsprint mills in North America. The mill, which dominates the western half of Calhoun, produces 750,000 metric tons of newsprint and specialty paper per year.

There is one government building in the city which functions as the town&#x27;s library, courthouse, police station, and fire station. Directly across the road from this building is a baseball field where Little League games are held.

Calhoun had its own high school that shut down in 1980. They had some very successful baseball teams. They also had basketball teams. Their cross river rivals were the Charleston panthers who also later closed their high school in 2001. 

On December 11, 1990, a heavy fog led to a crash involving 99 vehicles along Interstate 75 near Calhoun, killing 12 and injuring 42. As a result, electronic speed limit signs equipped with fog sensors have been installed along the Calhoun section of the interstate.

==Geography==
Calhoun is situated along the north bank of the Hiwassee River, which flows from the Appalachian Mountains to the east and empties into the Chickamauga Lake impoundment of the Tennessee River a few miles to the west. The river forms the boundary between McMinn County and Bradley County. The town of Charleston is located across the river to the south, on the Bradley County side.

Calhoun is situated around the junction of U.S. Route 11, which connects the town to Athens to the north and Charleston and Cleveland to the south, and State Route 163 (Bowater Road), which connects Calhoun to U.S. Route 411 in Delano to the east and Interstate 75 (Exit 36) to the west.

<text>Englewood is a town in McMinn County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 1,550 in 2020.

==History==

In 1857, businessman John Dixon established the Eureka Cotton Mills near what is now Englewood where they used regionally-grown cotton to produce yarn. The small mill community that developed around the mill became known as Eureka Mills. By 1875, Elisha Brient, a partner of Dixon, and several of Brient&#x27;s relatives had acquired Eureka Cotton Mills, and in 1894 the Brients renamed the town of Eureka Mills &quot;Englewood&quot;. The name was suggested by Nancy Chestnutt, a sister-in-law of James Brient, who thought the area resembled the English forests of the Robin Hood tales she had read about as a child.

In the late 19th century, the Brients began building shops and gristmills approximately northeast of their milltown at a railroad stop called Tellico Junction, where the Atlanta, Knoxville &amp; Northern Railroad (which roughly followed modern U.S. 411) intersected the Tellico Railroad (which connected Athens and Tellico Plains). The Brients also expanded their Englewood operation, establishing a flour and feed mill in partnership with J.W. Chestnutt. In 1907, the entire Englewood operation was moved to Tellico Junction to take advantage of the railroad. The following year, Tellico Junction was renamed Englewood and the original milltown subsequently became known as &quot;Old Englewood&quot;.

In 1917, Chestnutt formed the Englewood Manufacturing Company, which built a hosiery mill at Englewood. Englewood grew to include housing for 300 workers, and had its own company stores, sawmill, and school. The tenement section associated with the Eureka Cotton Mill became known as &quot;Yellow Top&quot;, the section associated with the hosiery mill became known as &quot;Socktown&quot;, and the section associated with the flour mill was called &quot;Onion Hill&quot;. Women worked at the mills in large numbers, mainly as weavers, while most supervisory positions were held by men.

During the Great Depression, the Englewood mills were forced to close, and many of the town&#x27;s residents joined various federal work programs. During World War II, the Eureka Cotton Mill was refurbished by the United National Clothing Center, which made clothing for donations to wartorn countries. Several mills and factories established operations at Englewood over subsequent decades, but most had shut down by the late 1990s. The last of the Englewood mills, Allied Hosiery, closed its doors in 2008. The Englewood Textile Museum, near the corner of Niota Street and Main Street, interprets the town&#x27;s manufacturing history.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. The town is situated in the Chestuee Creek Valley, a broad valley carved by a tributary of the Hiwassee River, which passes a few miles to the southwest. The Unicoi Mountains, part of the greater Blue Ridge Range, dominate the horizon to the south. U.S. Route 411 connects Englewood to Madisonville to the northeast and Etowah to the south. Tennessee State Highway 39 (South Niota Road and West Athens Street) connects Englewood to Athens, opposite the hills to the west and as Tellico Street, connects Englewood to Tellico Plains to the east.

<text>Etowah is a city in McMinn County in the U.S. state of Tennessee. The population was 3,613 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Etowah was founded in 1906, primarily as a location for a depot on the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad (L&amp;N) line as part of a more direct route between Atlanta and Cincinnati. The etymology of the town name is unclear, but local folklore states that a train crew brought a sign reading &quot;Etowah&quot; from the Etowah River, and the name stuck. The word Etowah comes from the Muskogee/Creek word &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;town.&quot;

In 1902, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad announced its plan to build a more direct line from Atlanta to Cincinnati in order to avoid the rugged mountains of North Georgia and East Tennessee bypassing the Great Hiwassee Loop. A point midway between these cities was needed to service cars and change crews, and at the end of 1904, land had been purchased in McMinn County to serve as this site and the city of Etowah was planned. The L &amp; N purchased for the main terminus (depot), maintenance and repair facilities (shops), railroad yards and proposed township to support the railroad workforce. This land was purchased at $10 to $20 per acre and the L&amp;N set about building a major rail center and the town of Etowah.

Out of what was referred to then as a wet swampland, a boomtown sprung up in 1906 with the L &amp; N Depot serving as the hub of the new town&#x27;s business and social activities. Since then, the City of Etowah has ridden the waves of economic downturns and successes, such as the closing of the L &amp; N shops in the 1930s and the recruitment of new industries, to evolve into the city that it is today. Etowah has seen positive growth in industry and retail over the past decade.

In 1974, Etowah residents Doug, Carol and Michael Tullock started the Bargain Barn grocery store, which has since grown into a chain that includes 39 stores in 5 states.

On April 3, 1974, an F3 tornado struck southern Etowah, destroying 23 homes and killing 3 people. The tornado was one of many in the 1974 Super Outbreak.

==Geography==
Etowah is located at (35.329579, −84.528196).

The group ran as the People’s Choice Party and was led by 78-year old Mayor Effie Lones, the oldest elected female official in the country at the time of her election. Every member of the Golden Girls was a grandmother. 4 of the candidates were elected via write-in votes, and they handed out sample ballots prior to Election Day to familiarize voters with the write-in process.

<text>Finger is a town in McNairy and Chester counties, Tennessee, USA. The population was 350 at the 2000 census.

== History ==
The area in and around Finger was settled in the early to mid-1820s. Originally named McIntyre&#x27;s Crossing, after Robert Thompson McIntyre, who was an early political leader and businessman, it was not named Finger until 1895. Between its settlement and 1895, the area progressed and both education and business were important to the area&#x27;s inhabitants. During the American Civil War, the area provided many soldiers to the Union cause and the area largely Unionist and Republican in its politics.

In 1895, with the need of a post office to serve its growing population, a new name was needed to satisfy federal postal authorities. Originally, the town was to be named &quot;Cash.&quot; However, that idea was dropped and, according to the late historian Horry Hodges, the Rev. J.J. Franklin, a resident of nearby McNairy Station, attended the meeting convened to give the town a name. According to Hodges, tempers flared and Franklin derisively and jokingly suggested the name &quot;Finger&quot; after witnessing several locals engaged in Finger pointing. Other sources suggest the city was named for an early resident, Andrew Jackson Finger (1815–1888). However, this is unlikely as this man was not prominent and resided in the area only a short period. Hodges&#x27; account is given more credibility because he was an active political and educational figure in 1895, the year of the events, as well as a resident of Finger. His is the only contemporary account.

From 1895 until the onset of the Great Depression in 1929–1930, the town continued to grow. At one point, it supported no less than 8 stores, 2 physicians, a funeral parlor, a hotel, 2 banks, a post office, an elementary and high school, cotton gin and numerous other smaller businesses. Its location on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad was one of the reasons for its successful development.

The town is the home of the annual Finger Barbecue, an event held largely since 1895. As of 2021, having been held for more than 110 years out of the last 126 years, it is one of the oldest and most enduring events of its kind in the state of Tennessee.

The Finger Diner was the original model for the Hard Rock Cafe chain.

The history of the town and surrounding area have been documented in a 511-page history entitled &quot;Let&#x27;s Call It Finger: A History of North McNairy County &amp; Finger, Tennessee &amp; Its Surrounding Communities,&quot; written by a native and descendant of the McIntyre family, early settlers of the area.

<text>Tellico Plains is a town in Monroe County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 859 at the 2000 census and 880 at the 2010 census. Tellico Plains is home to several communities that include Coker Creek, Belltown, Rafter, Mount Vernon, Rural Vale, and more.

==History==
The area along the Tellico River was inhabited for thousands of years by indigenous peoples. The historic Muscogee settled here, before moving further south. In the late 18th century, the Cherokee settled in this area, displaced from the east and north by European colonial encroachment.

A United States fur trade factory was situated here between 1795 and 1807.

Tellico Plains occupies the former site of the Cherokee town of Great Tellico, which was one of the more important towns of the Overhill Cherokee during the late 18th century and before Indian Removal of the 1830s. Two important Native American trails met at Great Tellico, the Trading Path and the Warrior Path, which connected farflung communities.
European Americans moved into the area and developed the land for agriculture, chiefly subsistence farming. During the 1840s, Elisha Johnson, a former mayor of Rochester, New York, purchased a plantation here and built the Tellico River Mansion on his property. With his brother Ebenezer, the former mayor of Buffalo, New York, he purchased the Tellico Iron and Manufacturing Company.

During the Civil War, the Confederacy commandeered the iron works for production of munitions. General William Sherman&#x27;s Union Army soldiers destroyed the Tellico Iron Works. Sherman pardoned Elisha Johnson for his part in supplying the Confederates because of Johnson&#x27;s northern birth and sympathies. Johnson returned to the North, settling in Ithaca, New York, where he died in 1866.

The nearby Coker Creek was the site of a minor gold rush during the late 1800s. The small crossroads town of Coker Creek has a gold-panning tourist attraction. Visitors can rent pans and receive professional instructions from the proprietor of the souvenir shop. Visitors can also explore the old gold mines in the surrounding hills, although the mines are in a state of disrepair. Commercial gold mining continues on at least one private plot located slightly to the southwest of the tourist attraction.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Tellico Plains became the base of operations for the Babcock Lumber Company, which ran logging operations throughout the Tellico River basin. When it finished clearcutting, it sold its land to the US Forest Service. It has worked for decades to restore the woods.

Tellico Plains was incorporated in 1911. Its first mayor was Columbus Jenkins, father of a noted attorney, Ray Jenkins.

Tellico Plains is home to the Charles Hall Museum. The town is also the eastern terminus of the Trans America Trail, a popular OHV route to Oregon and the Pacific Ocean.

<text>Clarksville is the county seat of Montgomery County, Tennessee, United States. The city had a population of 166,722 as of the 2020 census, making it the fifth-most populous city in Tennessee. It is the principal city of the Clarksville metropolitan area, which consists of Montgomery and Stewart counties in Tennessee and Christian and Trigg counties in Kentucky.

The city was founded in 1785 and incorporated in 1807, and named for General George Rogers Clark, frontier fighter and Revolutionary War hero, and brother of William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

Clarksville is the home of Austin Peay State University; &quot;The Leaf-Chronicle&quot;, the oldest newspaper in Tennessee; and neighbor to the Fort Campbell, United States Army post. The site of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), Fort Campbell is located about from downtown Clarksville and straddles the Tennessee-Kentucky state line.

==History==
===Colonization===

The area around Clarksville was first surveyed by Thomas Hutchins in 1768. He identified Red Paint Hill, a rock bluff at the confluence of the Cumberland and Red Rivers, as a navigational landmark.

In the years between 1771 and 1775, John Montgomery, the namesake of the county, along with Kasper Mansker, visited the area while on a hunting expedition. In 1771, James Robertson led a group of 12 or 13 families involved with the Regulator movement from near where present-day Raleigh, North Carolina now stands. In 1772, Robertson and the pioneers who had settled in northeast Tennessee (along the Watauga River, the Doe River, the Holston River, and the Nolichucky River) met at Sycamore Shoals to establish an independent regional government known as the Watauga Association.

In 1772, surveyors placed the land officially within the domain of the Cherokee tribe, who required negotiation of a lease with the settlers. As the lease was being celebrated, a Cherokee warrior was murdered by a white man. Through diplomacy, Robertson made peace with the Cherokee, who had threatened to expel the settlers by force.

In March 1775, land speculator and North Carolina judge Richard Henderson met with more than 1,200 Cherokees at Sycamore Shoals, including Cherokee leaders such as Attakullakulla, Oconostota, and Dragging Canoe. In the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals (also known as the Treaty of Watauga), Henderson purchased all the land lying between the Cumberland River, the Cumberland Mountains, and the Kentucky River, and situated south of the Ohio River in what is known as the Transylvania Purchase from the Cherokee Indians. The land thus delineated, , encompassed an area half as large as the present state of Kentucky. Henderson&#x27;s purchase was in violation of North Carolina and Virginia law, as well as the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which prohibited private purchase of American Indian land. Henderson may have mistakenly believed that a newer British legal opinion had made such land purchases legal.

All of present-day Tennessee was once recognized as Washington County, North Carolina. Created in 1777 from the western areas of Burke and Wilkes Counties, Washington County had as a precursor a Washington District of 1775–76, which was the first political entity named for the Commander-in-Chief of American forces in the Revolution.

===Founding===
In 1779, Hadley W. and Hannah W. brought a group of settlers from upper East Tennessee via Daniel Boone&#x27;s Wilderness Road. Hadley and Hannah later built an iron plantation in Cumberland Furnace. A year later, John Donelson led a group of flat boats up the Cumberland River bound for the French trading settlement, French Lick (or Big Lick), that later became Nashville. When the boats reached Red Paint Hill, Moses Renfroe, Joseph Renfroe, and Solomon Turpin, along with their families, branched off onto the Red River. They traveled to the mouth of Parson&#x27;s Creek, near Port Royal, and went ashore to settle down. Clarksville was designated as a town to be settled in part by soldiers from the disbanded Continental Army that served under General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War.

At the end of the war, the federal government lacked sufficient funds to repay the soldiers, so the Legislature of North Carolina, in 1790, designated the lands to the west of the state line as federal lands that could be used in the land grant program. Since the area of Clarksville had been surveyed and sectioned into plots, it was identified as a territory deemed ready for settlement. The land was available to be settled by the families of eligible soldiers as repayment of service to their country. On January 16, 1784, John Armstrong filed notice with the Legislature of North Carolina to create the town of Clarksville, named after General George Rogers Clark.

Even before it was officially designated a town, lots had been sold. In October 1785, Col. Robert Weakley laid off the town of Clarksville for Martin Armstrong and Col. Montgomery, and Weakley had the choice of lots for his services. He selected Lot #20 at the northeast corner of Spring and Main Streets. The town consisted of 20 &#x27;squares&#x27; of 140 lots and 44 out lots. The original Court House was on Lot #93, on the north side of Franklin Street between Front and Second Street. The Public Spring was on Lot #74, on the northeast corner of Spring and Commerce Streets. Weakley built the first cabin there in January 1786, and about February or March, Col. Montgomery came there and had a cabin built, which was the second house in Clarksville.

After an official survey by James Sanders, Clarksville was founded by the North Carolina Legislature on December 29, 1785. It was the second town to be founded in the area. Armstrong&#x27;s layout for the town consisted of 12 four-acre (16,000 m2) squares built on the hill overlooking the Cumberland as to protect against floods. The primary streets (from north to south) that went east–west were named Jefferson, Washington (now College Street), Franklin, Main, and Commerce Streets. North–south streets (from the river eastward) were named Water (now Riverside Drive), Spring, First, Second, and Third Streets.

The tobacco trade in the area was growing larger every year and in 1789, Montgomery and Martin Armstrong persuaded lawmakers to designate Clarksville as an inspection point for tobacco.

When Tennessee was founded as a state on June 1, 1796, the area around Clarksville and to the east was named Tennessee County. (This county was established in 1788, by North Carolina.) Later, Tennessee County was broken up into modern day Montgomery and Robertson counties, named to honor the men who first opened up the region for settlement.

===19th century===

Clarksville grew at a rapid pace. By 1806, the town realized the need for an educational institution, and it established the Rural Academy that year. It was later replaced by the Mount Pleasant Academy. By 1819, the newly established town had 22 stores, including a bakery and silversmith. In 1820, steamboats begin to navigate the Cumberland, bringing hardware, coffee, sugar, fabric, and glass. The city exported flour, tobacco, cotton, and corn to ports such as New Orleans and Pittsburgh along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.

In 1829, the first bridge connecting Clarksville to New Providence was built over the Red River. Nine years later, the Clarksville-Hopkinsville Turnpike was built. Railroad service came to the town on October 1, 1859, in the form of the Memphis, Clarksville and Louisville Railroad. The line later connected to other railroads at Paris, Tennessee and at Guthrie, Kentucky.

By the start of the Civil War, the combined population of the city and the county was 20,000. Planters in the area depended on enslaved African Americans as workers in the labor-intensive tobacco industry, one of the major commodity crops.

In 1861, both Clarksville and Montgomery counties voted unanimously for the state to secede and join the Confederate States of America. The birthplace of Confederate President Jefferson Davis was about 20 miles across the border in Fairview, Christian County, Kentucky. Both sides considered Clarksville to be of strategic importance.

Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston set up a defense line around Clarksville expecting a land attack. The city was home to three Confederate States Army camps:
* Camp Boone located on U.S. Highway 79 Guthrie Road/(Wilma Rudolph Boulevard),
* Camp Burnet
* Fort Defiance, Tennessee, a Civil War outpost that overlooks the Cumberland River and Red River, and was occupied by both Confederate and Union soldiers. In 2012 the City of Clarksville, Tennessee completed construction of an interpretive/ museum center here to chronicle the local chapter in the Civil War.

The Union sent troops and gunboats down the Cumberland River, and in 1862 captured Fort Donelson, and Fort Henry. On February 17, 1862, the &quot;USS Cairo&quot;, along with another Union ironclad, came to Clarksville and its troops captured the city. There were no Confederate soldiers to contend with because they had left prior to the arrival of the ships. White flags flew over Ft. Defiance and over Ft. Clark. Those town citizens who could get away, left as well. Before leaving, Confederate soldiers tried to burn the railroad bridge that crossed the Cumberland River, so that the Union could not use it. But the fire did not take hold and was put out before it could destroy the bridge. This railroad bridge made Clarksville very important to the Union. The &quot;USS Cairo&quot; tied up in Clarksville for a couple of days before moving to participate in the capture of Nashville.

Between 1862 and 1865, the city shifted hands, but the Union retained control. It also controlled the city&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Leaf Chronicle&quot;, for three years. Many slaves who had been freed or escaped gathered in Clarksville and joined the Union Army lines. The army set up contraband camps in mid-Tennessee cities, to provide shelter for the freedmen families. Other freed slaves lived along the side of the river in shanties. The Army enlisted freedmen in all-black regiments, in some cases putting them to work in building defenses. The 16th United States Colored Infantry regiment was mustered in at Clarksville in 1863.

===Reconstruction===

After the war, the city began Reconstruction, and in 1872, the existing railroad was purchased by the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad. The city was flourishing until the Great Fire of 1878, which destroyed 15 acres (60,000 m2) of downtown Clarksville&#x27;s business district, including the courthouse and many other historic buildings. It was believed to have started in a Franklin Street store. After the fire, the city rebuilt. The first automobile rolled into town, drawing much excitement.

===20th century===

In 1913, the Lillian Theater was opened on Franklin Street and owned by Joseph Goldberg. In 1914, it was severely damaged in a fire, but reopened later in 1915. It was later renamed the Roxy after renovations in 1941.

As World War I raged in Europe, many locals volunteered to go, reaffirming Tennessee as the Volunteer State, a nickname earned during the War of 1812, the Mexican–American War and other earlier conflicts. Also during this time, women&#x27;s suffrage was becoming a major issue. Clarksville women saw a need for banking independent of their husbands and fathers who were fighting. In response, the First Women&#x27;s Bank of Tennessee was established in 1919 by Mrs. Frank J. Runyon.

The 1920s brought additional growth to the city. A bus line between Clarksville and Hopkinsville was established in 1922. In 1927 the Austin Peay Normal School was founded, later to develop as Austin Peay State University. In 1928 two more theaters were added, the Majestic (with 600 seats) and the Capitol (with 900 seats). John Outlaw, a local aviator, established Outlaw Field in 1929.

With the entry of the United States into World War II, defense investments were made in the area. In 1942 construction started on Camp Campbell (now known as Fort Campbell), the new army base northwest of the city. It was capable of holding 23,000 troops, and as staffing built up, the base gave a huge boost to the population and economy of Clarksville.

In 1954, the Clarksville Memorial Hospital was founded along Madison Street. Downtown, the Lillian was renamed the Roxy Theater, and today it still hosts plays and performances weekly. The Roxy has been used as a backdrop for numerous photo shoots, films, documentaries, music videos and television commercials; most notably for Sheryl Crow&#x27;s Grammy Award-winning song &quot;All I Wanna Do.&quot;

Since 1980, the population of Clarksville has more than doubled. This increase was due in part to annexation, as the city acquired communities such as New Providence and Saint Bethlehem. The construction of Interstate 24 north of Saint Bethlehem added to its development potential and in the early 21st century, much of the growth along U.S. Highway 79 is commercial retail. Clarksville is currently one of the fastest-growing large cities in Tennessee. At its present rate of growth, the city was expected to displace Chattanooga by 2020 as the fourth-largest city in Tennessee.

===Natural disasters===

*In January 1999, the downtown area of Clarksville was devastated by an F3 tornado.
*Clarksville was damaged in the May 2010 Tennessee floods.
*In February 2018, the east side of Clarksville was struck by an EF-2 tornado.
*In December 2023, North Clarksville was struck by an EF-3 tornado that resulted in four fatalities and left multiple homes and businesses damaged or destroyed and over 20,000 people without power.
*In early May 2024, the city of Clarksville was affected by a severe weather and tornado outbreak, which resulted in some instances of flash-flooding and golf-ball sized hail. An EF-1 tornado touched down just east of Clarksville and did minor damage to nearby Springfield, TN.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.71%) is covered by water.

Clarksville is located on the northwest edge of the Highland Rim, which surrounds the Nashville Basin, and is northwest of Nashville.

Fort Campbell North is a census-designated place (CDP) in Christian County, Kentucky. It contains most of the housing for the Fort Campbell Army base. The population was 14,338 at the 2000 census. Fort Campbell North is part of the Clarksville, TN–KY Metropolitan Statistical Area.

===Climate===
The climate is humid subtropical (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) with hot summers and cold winters but interspersed with milder times due to its location between the warmer climates of the Gulf of Mexico and the colder ones of the Midwest. Freezing temperatures are not uncommon but usually the averages are above zero in January (around 2 °C) and in July can often pass through 25 °C. Snow in winter is common, but large accumulated amounts are more sporadic; usually the soil is covered by a thin layer during some time of winter. Precipitation is abundant year-round without any major difference, but May tends to have the highest cumulative amount of 142 mm in the form of rain. The wet season runs from February through July, while the dry season runs from August through January with a September nadir of 85 mm and secondary December peak of 125 mm.

==Sports==
Clarksville was home to several Minor League Baseball teams that played in the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League during the first half of the 20th century. They were called the Clarksville Villagers (1903), Grays (1904), Volunteers (1910 and 1916), Billies (1911), Rebels (1912), Boosters (1913–1914), Owls (1916), and Colts (1947–1949). It also hosted a team of the independent Big South League and Heartland League from 1996 to 1997 called the Clarksville Coyotes.

==Government==

In 1907, Clarksville was among several cities in Tennessee that gained legislative approval to adopt a board of commission form of government, with commissioners elected by at-large voting. Its population was 9,000. Other cities adopting a board of commission were Chattanooga and Knoxville in 1911, Nashville in 1913, and Jackson, Tennessee in 1915. The result of this change favored the election of candidates favored by the majority in each city. It closed out minorities from being able to elect candidates of their choice to represent them in local government.

Clarksville changed its government system, and in the 21st century, has a 12-member city council elected from single-member districts, which has increased the range of representation. In 2015, four of the members were African American, and eight were white. The mayor is elected at large. Mayor Joe Pitts was first elected in 2018, when he defeated former Mayor Kim McMillan who was the first woman mayor of any Tennessee city with more than 100,000 population.

Cobb Field was a small private airfield. It was west of the Dover Crossings area, just across the street from Liberty Elementary. It had one grass/sod runway that measured . This airfield was not open to the public and is no longer suitable for landing aircraft due to runway encroachment by nearby trees and brush, as well as fencing across the former runway. Cobb Field is no longer displayed on VFR sectional charts available from the FAA.

<text>Oakdale is a town located along the Emory River in Morgan County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 203 at the 2020 census, a decrease from the 2010 census figure of 212.

==History==
Oakdale was originally known as &quot;Honeycutt&quot; after an early settler, Allen Honeycutt. In the 1880s, the Cincinnati Southern Railway, which connected Chattanooga and Cincinnati, was built through the area, intersecting the vast system of the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railroad (later the Southern Railway) at Emory Gap near Harriman. Allen Honeycutt donated land to the railroad for construction of a switching point. In 1892, the name of the town was changed to &quot;Oakdale&quot; after a nearby mining operation.

The stretch of the Cincinnati Southern from Oakdale to Somerset, Kentucky involves steep grades that were too difficult for normal late-19th and early-20th century steam-powered locomotives, so a railyard was set up at Oakdale where trains were modified to allow them to make the trek north. By the early 1900s, Oakdale had developed into an important railroad town, with a bank, five general stores, a drugstore, a hardware store, three schools, two churches, six secret societies, and a newspaper. The railroad also erected a large hotel, the Babahatchie Inn (&quot;Babahatchie&quot; was the original name of the Emory River), in 1880, and rebuilt it after it burned in 1892. In 1905, this hotel was converted into one of the nation&#x27;s largest YMCA facilities, with 1,500 beds and its own library and clinic. Oakdale initially incorporated in 1887, though the state repealed its charter in 1895. It incorporated again in 1911.

The advent of diesel locomotives, which could handle the steep grades without modifications, eliminated the need for the Oakdale railyard, and the town declined in the mid-20th century. A park and tennis courts were built in the 1970s, and a new SR 299 bridge over the Emory was completed in 1999. The community is served by Oakdale School, operated by Morgan County Schools for students from pre-kindergarten through grade 12.

==Geography==

Oakdale is situated along the Emory River (between river miles 17 and 19) in a relatively hilly area atop the Cumberland Plateau, and is concentrated primarily in two areas on each side of the river. The western side is located along a slope that descends from State Route 299 to a flood plain along the river, and includes the town hall, fire department, and several houses. The eastern side is located in a hollow just north of SR 299, and includes a post office, park, and several more houses.

State routes 299 and 328 intersect at the town&#x27;s southern boundary. SR 328, which lies east of the river, connects the town with Harriman to the south and US 27 to the north. SR 299, which crosses the river, connects the town to I-40 and the Westel area in Cumberland County to the southwest.

<text>Wartburg is a city in and the county seat of Morgan County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 918 at the 2010 census.

==History==
In 1805, the Cherokee ceded what is now Morgan County to the United States by signing the Third Treaty of Tellico. The first settlers arrived in the area shortly thereafter.
Wartburg was founded in the mid-1840s by Georg Friedrich Gerding (later anglicized as &quot;George Frederick&quot;), a land speculator who bought up large tracts of land in what is now Morgan County and organized the East Tennessee Colonization Company with plans to establish a series of German colonies in the Cumberland region. 

: &quot;Born in Germany in 1800, he became a successful businessman after moving to New York. He was decorated by Belgium King Leopold I for establishing the first ship line between Antwerp and New York. He was U.S. Consul to Baden-Baden 1845-47. Acquiring 300,000 acres of land, he established the East Tennessee Land Colonization Co. for Swiss, German, and French immigrants. In 1844, he founded Wartburg, and gave land for the town square, a church, and a cemetery. He died in 1884.&quot;

German and Swiss immigrants, seeking to escape poor economic conditions in their home counties, arrived at the site by traveling from New Orleans up the Mississippi and Cumberland rivers to Nashville, and then by ox cart to the Cumberland Plateau. The first of these settlers arrived in the area in 1845, and new groups of immigrants would continue trickling in until 1855.

The new settlement, which had already been platted by East Tennessee Colonization Company agent Friedrich Guenther, was named after Wartburg Castle in Germany. 
: &quot;“The city was named after the German Wartburg, where Martin Luther translated the New Testament and parts of the Old Testament into German.”&quot; 
The first six streets were initially named for European cities, but the names were changed within a few years to Rose, Church, Maidenland (now Maiden), Kingston, Mill, and Cumberland. As most immigrants lived on farms outside the town, Wartburg grew slowly. By 1850, the town consisted of Gerding&#x27;s house and store, a church and school building, a doctor&#x27;s office, and a few small houses. Early residents included a number of professionals trained in Europe, including architect Carl Rothe, musician Gustav Knabe, painter George Dury, and physicians Rudolf Knaffl and F. A. Sienknecht. Gerding and the retired German officer Friedrich Karl Georg Freiherr von Forstner (1800–1861), who arrived with his family in 1847 and bought 1,500 acres, were the largest landowners.

While Morgan County was generally pro-Union during the Civil War, Wartburg was bitterly divided over the secession issue. Gerding, the city&#x27;s founder, supported the Confederacy. John Wilken, a prominent Lutheran pastor in the city, supported the Union. F.A. Sienknecht supported the Union, though two of his sons fought for the Confederacy. On January 2, 1862, a Confederate cavalry unit under Colonel J.W. White clashed with the Union Home Guard near Wartburg. In late March 1862, Confederate General Kirby Smith reported that all Confederate citizens had been expelled from the Wartburg area. In June 1863, Union General William P. Sanders marched through Wartburg and captured 104 Confederate soldiers in the vicinity.

In 1870, Morgan County elected to move its county seat from the now-defunct town of Montgomery, which had a population of just 50 residents and had been economically overshadowed by Wartburg. A new courthouse, consisting of a simple frame structure, was completed in 1871. The current Richardsonian Romanesque-style courthouse was built in 1904.

By the early 20th century, Wartburg had grown modestly, reporting a population of about 500 in 1920. At this time, the city included a bank, school, newspaper, four general stores, a clothing store, a hardware store, and a billiard hall. In 1968, Wartburg voted to incorporate, and elected Roy McNeal as its mayor.

==Geography==
Wartburg is situated amidst the Crab Orchard Mountains, a sub-range of the Cumberland Mountains, near the eastern edge of the Cumberland Plateau. Bird Mountain dominates the area east of Wartburg, rising from its base at the edge of the city and stretching for some to its summit at Frozen Head State Park. The Emory River, its source near the summit of Bird, flows westwardly along the mountain&#x27;s northern base, passing just north of Wartburg, and turning south before dropping off the plateau and emptying into the Watts Bar Lake impoundment of the Tennessee River. The Obed River flows eastwardly from Cumberland County through a scenic gorge before emptying into the Emory just west of Wartburg.

Wartburg is situated around the junction of U.S. Route 27, which connects the city to Kentucky to the north and Harriman and Interstate 40 to the south, and State Route 62, which connects Wartburg to Oak Ridge to the east and the rural areas of Morgan County and Fentress County to the west.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

==Twin City==
South Fulton is considered a twin city with Fulton, Kentucky. Together, they used to host the International Banana Festival in celebration of the fact that the twin cities railroad maintained an icing station for a large percentage of bananas en route to northern destinations arriving from New Orleans. A two-ton banana pudding was marched through a parade and served at the end of the parade route.

Recently this Banana Festival was brought back in 2011. In 2012, they had the 50th anniversary of the Banana Festival. This festival occurs towards the end of September and includes the pudding, seller booths, and concessions.

==History==
South Fulton was first known as Jacksonville due to the fact that land in the area once belonged to Andrew Jackson. It is recorded that Andrew Jackson sold in northeast Weakley County in 1823. Jacksonville existed from about 1859 until 1895 when South Fulton was first chartered.
==Education==
It is in the Obion County School District.

==&quot;Pay for Spray&quot; controversy==
Starting in the early 1990s, South Fulton adopted a policy of allowing people outside the city limits to be protected by the fire department, in return for a $75 annual fee. But unlike neighboring towns, which would even protect someone who had not paid (while charging them a larger fee covering expenses), South Fulton would simply refuse to help anyone not on a list as having paid up.
In 2010, a member of the Cranick family of Obion County was burning trash near the family home, when it got out of control and caught the house on fire. They called 911, but the fire department refused to respond, because the Cranicks weren&#x27;t on the list as having paid the tax. Understanding the premise of the free rider problem, Gene Cranick offered to pay the full cost of the department responding, but was refused. The South Fulton Fire Department did show up, but refrained from helping, only protecting the property of a neighbor who had paid the tax. The Cranicks lost three dogs and the family cat, along with the house and most of their possessions.
In 2011 this happened again, with Vicky Bell, the homeowner, reporting that the fire department actually pulled up and watched, but did not help.
This policy has been decried by media nationally, including Keith Olbermann, and Harold Schaitberger, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, who said &quot;Professional, career firefighters shouldn’t be forced to check a list before running out the door to see which homeowners have paid up...They get in their trucks and go.&quot;
Conversely, this policy was defended by some, including Glenn Beck and the National Review
Two years after this controversy started, the city of South Fulton changed their policy. Going forward, any homeowner who didn&#x27;t pay the $75 tax must pay $3,500 per call.

<doc id="135316" wikidata="Q114799" url="?curid=135316" title="Sexagesimal">
<text>Sexagesimal, also known as base 60, is a numeral system with sixty as its base. It originated with the ancient Sumerians in the 3rd millennium BC, was passed down to the ancient Babylonians, and is still used—in a modified form—for measuring time, angles, and geographic coordinates.

The number 60, a superior highly composite number, has twelve divisors, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60, of which 2, 3, and 5 are prime numbers. With so many factors, many fractions involving sexagesimal numbers are simplified. For example, one hour can be divided evenly into sections of 30 minutes, 20 minutes, 15 minutes, 12 minutes, 10 minutes, 6 minutes, 5 minutes, 4 minutes, 3 minutes, 2 minutes, and 1 minute. 60 is the smallest number that is divisible by every number from 1 to 6; that is, it is the lowest common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

&quot;In this article, all sexagesimal digits are represented as decimal numbers, except where otherwise noted. For example, the largest sexagesimal digit is &quot;59&quot;.&quot;

==Origin==

According to Otto Neugebauer, the origins of sexagesimal are not as simple, consistent, or singular in time as they are often portrayed. Throughout their many centuries of use, which continues today for specialized topics such as time, angles, and astronomical coordinate systems, sexagesimal notations have always contained a strong undercurrent of decimal notation, such as in how sexagesimal digits are written. Their use has also always included (and continues to include) inconsistencies in where and how various bases are to represent numbers even within a single text.
The most powerful driver for rigorous, fully self-consistent use of sexagesimal has always been its mathematical advantages for writing and calculating fractions. In ancient texts this shows up in the fact that sexagesimal is used most uniformly and consistently in mathematical tables of data. Another practical factor that helped expand the use of sexagesimal in the past, even if less consistently than in mathematical tables, was its decided advantages to merchants and buyers for making everyday financial transactions easier when they involved bargaining for and dividing up larger quantities of goods. In the late 3rd millennium BC, Sumerian/Akkadian units of weight included the &quot;kakkaru&quot; (talent, approximately 30 kg) divided into 60 &quot;manû&quot; (mina), which was further subdivided into 60 &quot;šiqlu&quot; (shekel); the descendants of these units persisted for millennia, though the Greeks later coerced this relationship into the more base-10–compatible ratio of a &quot;shekel&quot; being one 50th of a &quot;mina&quot;.

Apart from mathematical tables, the inconsistencies in how numbers were represented within most texts extended all the way down to the most basic cuneiform symbols used to represent numeric quantities. For example, the cuneiform symbol for 1 was an ellipse made by applying the rounded end of the stylus at an angle to the clay, while the sexagesimal symbol for 60 was a larger oval or &quot;big 1&quot;. But within the same texts in which these symbols were used, the number 10 was represented as a circle made by applying the round end of the style perpendicular to the clay, and a larger circle or &quot;big 10&quot; was used to represent 100. Such multi-base numeric quantity symbols could be mixed with each other and with abbreviations, even within a single number. The details and even the magnitudes implied (since zero was not used consistently) were idiomatic to the particular time periods, cultures, and quantities or concepts being represented. In modern times there is the recent innovation of adding decimal fractions to sexagesimal astronomical coordinates.

==Usage==

===Babylonian mathematics===

The sexagesimal system as used in ancient Mesopotamia was not a pure base-60 system, in the sense that it did not use 60 distinct symbols for its digits. Instead, the cuneiform digits used ten as a sub-base in the fashion of a sign-value notation: a sexagesimal digit was composed of a group of narrow, wedge-shaped marks representing units up to nine (, , , , ..., ) and a group of wide, wedge-shaped marks representing up to five tens (, , , , ). The value of the digit was the sum of the values of its component parts:

Numbers larger than 59 were indicated by multiple symbol blocks of this form in place value notation. Because there was no symbol for zero it is not always immediately obvious how a number should be interpreted, and its true value must sometimes have been determined by its context. For example, the symbols for 1 and 60 are identical. Later Babylonian texts used a placeholder () to represent zero, but only in the medial positions, and not on the right-hand side of the number, as in numbers like .

===Other historical usages===

In the Chinese calendar, a system is commonly used in which days or years are named by positions in a sequence of ten stems and in another sequence of 12 branches. The same stem and branch repeat every 60 steps through this cycle.

Book VIII of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; involves an allegory of marriage centered on the number 604 = and its divisors. This number has the particularly simple sexagesimal representation 1,0,0,0,0. Later scholars have invoked both Babylonian mathematics and music theory in an attempt to explain this passage.

Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, a treatise on mathematical astronomy written in the second century AD, uses base 60 to express the fractional parts of numbers. In particular, his table of chords, which was essentially the only extensive trigonometric table for more than a millennium, has fractional parts of a degree in base 60, and was practically equivalent to a modern-day table of values of the sine function.

Medieval astronomers also used sexagesimal numbers to note time. Al-Biruni first subdivided the hour sexagesimally into minutes, seconds, thirds and fourths in 1000 while discussing Jewish months. Around 1235 John of Sacrobosco continued this tradition, although Nothaft thought Sacrobosco was the first to do so. The Parisian version of the Alfonsine tables (ca. 1320) used the day as the basic unit of time, recording multiples and fractions of a day in base-60 notation.

The sexagesimal number system continued to be frequently used by European astronomers for performing calculations as late as 1671. For instance, Jost Bürgi in &quot;Fundamentum Astronomiae&quot; (presented to Emperor Rudolf II in 1592), his colleague Ursus in &quot;Fundamentum Astronomicum&quot;, and possibly also Henry Briggs, used multiplication tables based on the sexagesimal system in the late 16th century, to calculate sines.

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Tamil astronomers were found to make astronomical calculations, reckoning with shells using a mixture of decimal and sexagesimal notations developed by Hellenistic astronomers.

Base-60 number systems have also been used in some other cultures that are unrelated to the Sumerians, for example by the Ekari people of Western New Guinea.

===Modern usage===
Modern uses for the sexagesimal system include measuring angles, geographic coordinates, electronic navigation, and time.

One hour of time is divided into 60 minutes, and one minute is divided into 60 seconds. Thus, a measurement of time such as 3:23:17 can be interpreted as a whole sexagesimal number (no sexagesimal point), meaning . However, each of the three sexagesimal digits in this number (3, 23, and 17) is written using the decimal system.

Similarly, the practical unit of angular measure is the degree, of which there are 360 (six sixties) in a circle. There are 60 minutes of arc in a degree, and 60 arcseconds in a minute.

==== YAML ====
In version 1.1 of the YAML data storage format, sexagesimals are supported for plain scalars, and formally specified both for integers and floating point numbers. This has led to confusion, as e.g. some MAC addresses would be recognised as sexagesimals and loaded as integers, where others were not and loaded as strings. In YAML 1.2 support for sexagesimals was dropped.

==Notations==

In Hellenistic Greek astronomical texts, such as the writings of Ptolemy, sexagesimal numbers were written using Greek alphabetic numerals, with each sexagesimal digit being treated as a distinct number. Hellenistic astronomers adopted a new symbol for zero, , which morphed over the centuries into other forms, including the Greek letter omicron, ο, normally meaning 70, but permissible in a sexagesimal system where the maximum value in any position is 59. The Greeks limited their use of sexagesimal numbers to the fractional part of a number.

In medieval Latin texts, sexagesimal numbers were written using Arabic numerals; the different levels of fractions were denoted &quot;minuta&quot; (i.e., fraction), &quot;minuta secunda&quot;, &quot;minuta tertia&quot;, etc. By the 17th century it became common to denote the integer part of sexagesimal numbers by a superscripted zero, and the various fractional parts by one or more accent marks. John Wallis, in his &quot;Mathesis universalis&quot;, generalized this notation to include higher multiples of 60; giving as an example the number ; where the numbers to the left are multiplied by higher powers of 60, the numbers to the right are divided by powers of 60, and the number marked with the superscripted zero is multiplied by 1. This notation leads to the modern signs for degrees, minutes, and seconds. The same minute and second nomenclature is also used for units of time, and the modern notation for time with hours, minutes, and seconds written in decimal and separated from each other by colons may be interpreted as a form of sexagesimal notation.

In some usage systems, each position past the sexagesimal point was numbered, using Latin or French roots: &quot;prime&quot; or &quot;primus&quot;, &quot;seconde&quot; or &quot;secundus&quot;, &quot;tierce&quot;, &quot;quatre&quot;, &quot;quinte&quot;, etc. To this day we call the second-order part of an hour or of a degree a &quot;second&quot;. Until at least the 18th century, of a second was called a &quot;tierce&quot; or &quot;third&quot;.

In the 1930s, Otto Neugebauer introduced a modern notational system for Babylonian and Hellenistic numbers that substitutes modern decimal notation from 0 to 59 in each position, while using a semicolon (;) to separate the integer and fractional portions of the number and using a comma (,) to separate the positions within each portion. For example, the mean synodic month used by both Babylonian and Hellenistic astronomers and still used in the Hebrew calendar is 29;31,50,8,20 days. This notation is used in this article.

== Fractions and irrational numbers ==
=== Fractions ===
In the sexagesimal system, any fraction in which the denominator is a regular number (having only 2, 3, and 5 in its prime factorization) may be expressed exactly. Shown here are all fractions of this type in which the denominator is less than or equal to 60:
: = 0;30
: = 0;20
: = 0;15
: = 0;12
: = 0;10
: = 0;7,30
: = 0;6,40
: = 0;6
: = 0;5
: = 0;4
: = 0;3,45
: = 0;3,20
: = 0;3
: = 0;2,30
: = 0;2,24
: = 0;2,13,20
: = 0;2
: = 0;1,52,30
: = 0;1,40
: = 0;1,30
: = 0;1,20
: = 0;1,15
: = 0;1,12
: = 0;1,6,40
: = 0;1
However numbers that are not regular form more complicated repeating fractions. For example:

: = 0; (the bar indicates the sequence of sexagesimal digits 8,34,17 repeats infinitely many times)
: = 0;
: = 0;
: = 0;4,
: = 0;
: = 0;
: = 0;
: = 0;

The fact that the two numbers that are adjacent to sixty, 59 and 61, are both prime numbers implies that fractions that repeat with a period of one or two sexagesimal digits can only have regular number multiples of 59 or 61 as their denominators, and that other non-regular numbers have fractions that repeat with a longer period.

=== Irrational numbers ===

The representations of irrational numbers in any positional number system (including decimal and sexagesimal) neither terminate nor repeat.

The square root of 2, the length of the diagonal of a unit square, was approximated by the Babylonians of the Old Babylonian Period () as
:formula_1
Because  ≈ ... is an irrational number, it cannot be expressed exactly in sexagesimal (or indeed any integer-base system), but its sexagesimal expansion does begin 1;24,51,10,7,46,6,4,44... ()

The value of  as used by the Greek mathematician and scientist Ptolemy was 3;8,30 = = ≈ ... Jamshīd al-Kāshī, a 15th-century Persian mathematician, calculated 2 as a sexagesimal expression to its correct value when rounded to nine subdigits (thus to ); his value for 2 was 6;16,59,28,1,34,51,46,14,50. Like above, 2 is an irrational number and cannot be expressed exactly in sexagesimal. Its sexagesimal expansion begins 6;16,59,28,1,34,51,46,14,49,55,12,35... ()

<text>Troy is a town in Obion County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 1,423 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Union City, TN–KY Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Troy was founded in 1825 as the original county seat of Obion County. Frontiersman Davy Crockett was in attendance when the town was planted. The Paducah &amp; Memphis Railroad extended its line from Union City to Trimble in May 1874. The line did not go through the town, but bypassed it to the south. In 1888, the Troy and Tiptonville Railroad started operations. This was a short line that connected the town with the (former Paducah &amp; Memphis Railroad) Illinois Central Railroad at Moffat on the ICC line. Troy remained the county seat until 1890, when it was moved to Union City following a contentious legal dispute.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Troy has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States Census, there were 1,423 people, 684 households, and 464 families residing in the town.

===2000 census===
As of the census of 2000, there were 1,273 people, 533 households, and 367 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 576 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 98.35% White, 1.26% African American, 0.16% from other races, and 0.24% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.26% of the population.

There were 533 households, out of which 30.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 55.5% were married couples living together, 10.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.1% were non-families. 28.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.39 and the average family size was 2.89.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 23.4% under the age of 18, 9.0% from 18 to 24, 28.8% from 25 to 44, 23.5% from 45 to 64, and 15.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 88.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.7 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $30,664, and the median income for a family was $38,500. Males had a median income of $28,594 versus $20,208 for females. The per capita income for the town was $15,255. About 12.5% of families and 14.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 14.1% of those under age 18 and 25.4% of those age 65 or over.

<text>Lobelville is a city in Perry County, Tennessee, United States that was established as a trading post on the Buffalo River in 1854. The population was 897 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
Lobelville was established in 1854 by French trader Henri de Lobel. Originally known as Lobelsville, Lobel established a trading post on the Buffalo River in the early 19th century expecting that it would become a trading route. The proximity of the Tennessee River made this an unprofitable venture, and it never took off as a major trading point.

==Geography==
Lobelville is located at (35.751119, -87.793085).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and 0.25% is water.

Lobelville now is the site of a major transfer point on the Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company pipeline network, which is also the oldest continuously operating business in the town, beginning operations in 1943. It is bisected by State Route 13, a connector to Interstate 40 (via exit 143 approximately north in Humphreys County, Tennessee) and U.S. Route 412 approximately south in Linden. State Route 438 also passes through the southern part of Lobelville.

Mousetail Landing State Park is situated south-west of Lobelville in Perry County along the Tennessee River. The Buffalo River Country Club is a local 9-hole semi-private golf course. Hunting, fishing, and camping (both at prepared sites and back-country) are widely available in the area.

== Plain community ==
There is a Plain, Old Order community at Cane Creek, Lobelville, called &quot;Believers in Christ&quot; that is different from other Old Order Mennonite and Amish communities in being rather intentional than traditional. It is in some way similar to communities like the &quot;Christian Communities&quot; of Elmo Stoll, the Caneyville Christian Community and the Noah Hoover Mennonites.

<text>Benton is a town in Polk County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 1,532 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat.

Benton is included in the Cleveland, Tennessee Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Benton was founded in 1840 as a county seat for Polk County, which had been established the previous year. The town, originally a trading post known as McKamy&#x27;s stock stand, was named in honor of politician and US Senator from Missouri, Thomas Hart Benton.

Nancy Ward, a Cherokee known as &quot;Nanyehi,&quot; was a Beloved Woman, a leader among her people. For many years, she participated in negotiations with the British and Americans. After the American Revolution, she had an inn here and was finally buried here. The Nancy Ward Chapter of the DAR, named in her honor, has marked the graves of her and her son Fivekiller.
On May 27, 1983, the Benton fireworks disaster occurred on a farm southeast of the city. An explosion at a secret fireworks operation killed eleven, injured one, and caused damage within a radius of several miles, revealing the illegal business.

<text>Copperhill is a city in Polk County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 443 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Cleveland Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Copperhill is located in a geological region known as the Copper Basin, which was the site of a major copper mining operation between the 1840s and 1987.

Starting around the time of the Civil War, the production method for removing the Sulphur from the copper ore mined in the area required building bonfires, throwing in the ore, and burning off the Sulphur. This necessitated cutting most of the trees in the valley for the bonfires. The acid rain caused by the burning of the Sulphur inhibited additional vegetation from growing, and the topsoil consequently washed off the hilly terrain due to lack of vegetation to hold it. Though acid plants were later built to convert the Sulphur into a useful product, the result of the earlier activities was that for years, up until the 1980s, the area was denuded of any greenery, and the red clay soil remaining gave it a Martian appearance. The area has now been greatly reforested, due to a multimillion-dollar effort by the successor companies to the original copper company. The copper and acid plants have been permanently closed and most of the plant infrastructure already removed and sold overseas. Much of the scrap metals from the site have been removed and sold to China. Glenn Springs Holdings has cleaned and purified all the surrounding creeks and waterways, and water quality is now back to near pristine condition according to published EPA and Tennessee Department of Environmental Conservation studies.

The town these days is a tourist attraction, with near daily rail excursions from Blue Ridge, Georgia, on the Blue Ridge Scenic Railway, and near daily rail excursions from The Gee Creek Wilderness on the Hiwassee River train route. Whitewater rafting on the Ocoee River also attracts many people and other outdoor activities such as Mountain Biking and Hiking are also popular in the area. The area was the host for the whitewater portion of the 1996 Summer Olympics.

==Geography==
Copperhill is located at (34.992108, -84.374254), situated in extreme southeast Tennessee, bordering North Georgia.

Its twin city is McCaysville, Georgia, with the two situated as a single town aligned along a northwestward-flowing river, known as the Toccoa River in Georgia, and the Ocoee River in Tennessee, rather than the east/west state line, which cuts diagonally across streets (where it is marked with a blue line) and through buildings. There is a main downtown area, which the town shares with McCaysville, and it retains a historic feel of when it was thriving. The main street through town is Ocoee Street (Tennessee State Route 68) which becomes Toccoa Street (Georgia State Route 60) to the east-southeast in McCaysville. A truss bridge over the river at the state line links them to Blue Ridge Drive (Georgia 5) to the south-southwest.

In the early morning hours of February 16, 1990, a major flood struck the towns, although it is now hard to see any damage from this flooding. The upstream Blue Ridge Dam was raised several feet by the Tennessee Valley Authority, thus greatly minimizing any potential future possible occurrence of flooding. There have been no further incidents with the river flooding.

As a result of the state line, homes and businesses on the Copperhill side of town have area code 423, while those on the McCaysville side have area code 706.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (2.08%) is water.

<doc id="135326" wikidata="Q2642857" url="?curid=135326" title="Ducktown, Tennessee">
<text>Ducktown () is a city in Polk County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 461 at the 2020 census and 475 at the 2010 census. It is included in the Cleveland Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Ducktown is located in a geological region known as the Copper Basin, and was the center of a major copper-mining district from 1847 until 1987. The district also produced iron, sulfur and zinc as byproducts. Ducktown was the birthplace of Rockabilly Hall of Famer, Stan Beaver.

Literary historian Ben Harris McClary suggests that a Ducktown-area farmer named William &quot;Sut&quot; Miller (d. 1858) was the inspiration for the George Washington Harris character, Sut Lovingood. Ducktown and several Ducktown-area features, such as Big Frog Mountain and the Ocoee River (&quot;Oconee&quot;), are mentioned in the Sut Lovingood tales.

===The pre-mining period===

The Cherokee inhabited the Copper Basin as early as the late 18th century, well before the arrival of the first Euro-American settlers. Their territory extended into northern Georgia. The Cherokee village of &quot;Gawonvyi&quot; (also known as Kawana)— which means “duck place” in English— is believed to have been located at the confluence of the Ocoee River and Tumbling Creek. The village&#x27;s name was recorded on Cherokee annuity distribution rolls as &quot;Ducktown&quot; in 1799. According to tradition, Ducktown was named after a Cherokee leader named Chief Duck.

In 1836, the Cherokee relinquished control of the Copper Basin to the U.S. government as part of lands they ceded in Tennessee and Georgia in the Treaty of New Echota. Although the U.S. removed many of the basin&#x27;s Cherokee inhabitants in the march to Indian Territory, some avoided the roundup by hiding out in the surrounding mountains. They would later help build the Old Copper Road (now part of US U.S. Route 64). In the 1840s and 1850s, Ducktown was called &quot;Hiwassee&quot; or &quot;Hiawassee,&quot; after the Cherokee name for a major river in the area. This name was subsequently adopted for the city&#x27;s first major mining operation.

===Early mining years===
The copper was discovered in 1843 by a prospector, presumably panning for gold, who found nuggets of native copper. The first shipment of copper ore was taken out on muleback in 1847. More than 30 mining companies were incorporated between 1852 and 1855 to mine copper at Ducktown. Development was accelerated by a road built in 1853 connecting the area with Cleveland, Tennessee. The first smelter was built in the Ducktown district in 1854.

Mining ceased when Union troops destroyed the copper refinery and mill at Cleveland, Tennessee in 1863. Mining resumed in 1866, and continued until 1878, when the mines had exhausted the shallow high-grade copper ores.

===Later years===
By 1906, the Tennessee Copper Company had begun constructing an acid reclamation plant near Copperhill, Tennessee to recover most of the sulfur in the form of sulfuric acid rather than releasing it to the atmosphere. Froth flotation was added in the 1920s.

==Geography==
Ducktown is situated at the center of the Copper Basin (sometimes called the Ducktown Basin), a broad valley located in the southern Appalachian Mountains near the intersection of Tennessee, Georgia, and North Carolina. The Ducktown area is part of the Ocoee River watershed (which hosted the Canoe slalom events for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta), which passes through the Copper Basin a few miles southwest of Ducktown before entering its gorge. Ducktown is centered just north of the junction of Tennessee State Route 68, which connects the city to Madisonville to the north and Copperhill to the south, and U.S. Route 64, which connects the city to Cleveland (via the Ocoee River Gorge) to the west and Murphy, North Carolina to the east.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The Ducktown Basin Museum, located on the site of the Burra Burra Mine in Ducktown, chronicles the geology and history of the mining activities in the basin.

<doc id="135327" wikidata="Q56514238" url="?curid=135327" title="Mass killing">
<text>Mass killing is a concept which has been proposed by genocide scholars who wish to define incidents of non-combat killing which are perpetrated by a government or a state. A mass killing is commonly defined as the killing of group members without the intention to eliminate the whole group, or otherwise the killing of large numbers of people without a clear group membership.

&quot;Mass killing&quot; is used by a number of genocide scholars because &quot;genocide&quot; (its strict definition) does not cover mass killing events in which no specific ethnic or religious groups are targeted, or events in which perpetrators do not intend to eliminate whole groups or significant parts of them. Genocide scholars use different models in order to explain and predict the onset of mass killing events. There has been little consensus and no generally-accepted terminology, prompting scholars, such as Anton Weiss-Wendt, to describe comparative attempts a failure. Genocide scholarship rarely appears in mainstream disciplinary journals.

== Terminology ==
Several different terms are used to describe the intentional killing of large numbers of noncombatants, but there is no consensus or generally-accepted terminology. &quot;Mass killing&quot; has emerged as a &quot;more straightforward&quot; term than &quot;genocide&quot; or &quot;politicide&quot;. Mass killing was proposed by genocide scholars in attempts to collect a uniform global database of genocidal events and identify statistical models for prediction of onset of mass killings. Atsushi Tago and Frank Wayman reference mass killing as defined by Valentino and state that even with a lower threshold (10,000 killed per year, 1,000 killed per year, or even 1), &quot;autocratic regimes, especially communist, are prone to mass killing generically, but not so strongly inclined (i.e. not statistically significantly inclined) toward geno-politicide.&quot; Other terms used by several authors to describe mass killings of non-combattents include:
* Classicide – &quot;intended mass killing of entire social classes&quot;, which sociologist Michael Mann considers more apt than &quot;genocide&quot; for describing killings with the intent of suppression of the bourgeoisie in communist states.
* Gendercide – the systematic killing of members of a specific gender. 
* Democide – political scientist Rudolph Rummel defined democide as &quot;the intentional killing of an unarmed or disarmed person by government agents acting in their authoritative capacity and pursuant to government policy or high command&quot;; according to Rummel, this definition covers a wide range of deaths, including forced labor and concentration camp victims, killings by unofficial private groups, extrajudicial summary killings and mass deaths in deliberate famines as well as killings by &quot;de facto&quot; governments, e.g. civil war killings. Rummel&#x27;s democide concept is similar to geno-politicide, but there are two important differences. First, an important prerequisite for geno-politicide is government&#x27;s intent to destroy a specific group. In contrast, democide deals with wider range of cases, including the cases when governments are engaged in random killing either directly or due to the acts of criminal omission and neglect. Second, whereas some lower threshold exists for a killing event to be considered geno-politicide, there is no low threshold for democide which covers any murder of any number of persons by any government.
* Genocide – under the Genocide Convention, the crime of genocide generally applies to mass murder of ethnic rather than political or social groups. Protection of political groups was eliminated from the United Nations resolution after a second vote because many states anticipated that clause to apply unneeded limitations to their right to suppress internal disturbances. &quot;Genocide&quot; is also a popular term for political killings which are studied academically as democide and politicide.
* Mass killing – referencing earlier definitions, Joan Esteban, Massimo Morelli, and Dominic Rohner define mass killings as &quot;the killings of substantial numbers of human beings, when not in the course of military action against the military forces of an avowed enemy, under the conditions of the essential defenselessness and helplessness of the victims.&quot; Valentino defines the term as &quot;the intentional killing of a massive number of noncombatants&quot;, where a &quot;massive number&quot; is at least 50,000 intentional deaths over the course of five years or less; this is the most accepted quantitative minimum threshold for the term.
* Politicide – some genocide scholars propose the concept of politicide to describe the killing of groups that would not otherwise be covered by the Genocide Convention. Barbara Harff studies genocide and politicide, sometimes shortened as geno-politicide, to include the mass killing of political, economic, ethnic, and cultural groups.

In the United States, the Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012, passed in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, clarified the statutory authority for federal law enforcement agencies to provide investigatory assistance to the States, and mandated across federal agencies, including the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, a definition of &quot;mass killing&quot; as three or more killings during an incident, while making no reference to the choice of weapon.

== Topology ==
Benjamin Valentino outlines two major categories of mass killings: dispossessive mass killing and coercive mass killing. The first category defines three types: communist, ethnic, and territorial, containing the following scenarios of ethnic cleansing, killings that accompany agrarian reforms in some Communist states, and killings during colonial expansion, among others. The second category includes the types: counterguerrilla, terrorist, and imperialist, containing the following scenarios of killing during counterinsurgent warfare, and killings as part of the imperialist conquests by the Axis powers during the World War II, among others.

== Analysis ==
Benjamin Valentino does not consider ideology or regime-type as an important factor that explains mass killings, and outlines Communist mass killing as a subtype of dispossessive mass killing, which is considered as a complication of original theory his book is based on. About why it occurs, Valentino states that ideology, paranoia, and racism can shape leaders&#x27; beliefs for why genocide and mass killing may be justified. Unlike Rudolph Rummel and first-generation studies, Valentino does not see authoritarianism or totalitarianism as explaining mass killing; it is not ideology or regime-type but the leader&#x27;s motive that matters and can explain it, which is in line with second-generation scholarship.

Manus Midlarsky also focuses on leaders&#x27; decision making but his case selection and general conclusions are different from Valentino&#x27;s. Midlarsky has a narrower definition of the dependent variable and only analyzes three case studies (the Armenian genocide, the Holocaust, and the Rwanda genocide). Midlarsky tries to explain why individuals may comply with the culprits, why politicide rather than genocide happened in Cambodia (Cambodian genocide), and why ethnic minorities, such as Greeks in the Ottoman Empire and Jews in the Second Polish Republic, were not targeted for genocide. Like Michael Mann and Valentino to a lesser extent, Midlarsky mainly addresses genocides that did not take place. Both Midlarsky and Valentino mainly focus on proximate conditions, while Mann considers genocide within the broad context of ideologies and nation-states development.

== Global databases of mass killings ==
At least two global databases of mass killings are available. The first compilation by Rudolph Rummel covers a time period from the beginning of the 20th century until 1987 covering democide, while the second compilation by Barbara Harff combines politicide and genocide since 1955. The Harff database is the most frequently used by genocide scholars, while the Rummel database is a good framework for studying mass killings during the 1900–1987 period.

These data are intended mostly for statistical analysis of mass killings in attempt to identify the best predictors for their onset. According to Harff, these data are not necessarily the most accurate for a given country, since some sources are general genocide scholars and not experts on local history. A comparative analysis of the Yugoslav data in two databases revealed a significant difference between the figures of killed per years and low correlation between Rummel&#x27;s and Harff&#x27;s data sets. Tomislav Dulić criticized Rummel&#x27;s generally higher numbers as arising from flaws in Rummel&#x27;s statistical methodology, and Rummel&#x27;s response was not convincing.

Another comparative analysis of the two complete databases by Atsushi Tago and Frank W. Wayman revealed that the significant difference between the figures is explained by Harff&#x27;s dataset of politicide-geoncide being essentially a subset of Rummel&#x27;s dataset, where he includes other types of killings in addition to politicide-genocide.

<text>Algood is a city in Putnam County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 3,963 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Cookeville Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

While Algood was not established until the late 19th century, in the early 19th century a small community developed just south of modern Algood at White Plains, an antebellum plantation and important stopover along the Walton Road (which connected Nashville and Knoxville). In the 1880s, the Nashville &amp; Knoxville Railroad erected a depot at what is now Algood. The land on which the depot was built was purchased from a circuit rider and early settler named Joel Algood, and thus the train stop was named after him. For a period of time the area would be called Algood&#x27;s Old Fields. In 1899, the Algood Methodist Church (now Algood United Methodist Church) was built on land donated by the children of this early settler. Algood was initially incorporated in 1901, but repealed its own charter two years later. The town reincorporated in 1911.

==Geography==
The town is situated at the base of Algood Mountain (el. ), one of a series of low, wide ridges in the area that present as &quot;stair steps&quot; from the Highland Rim to the Cumberland Plateau. Algood is centered along the former State Route 42 (Main Street), a state highway designation which no longer exists, just east of the road&#x27;s two junctions with State Route 111.

<text>Cookeville is the county seat and largest city of Putnam County, Tennessee, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, its population was reported to be 34,842. It is recognized as one of the country&#x27;s micropolitan areas, smaller cities that function as significant regional economic hubs. Of Tennessee&#x27;s 20 micropolitan areas, Cookeville is the largest. The Cookeville micropolitan area&#x27;s 2020 census population was 141,333. The U.S. Census Bureau ranked the Cookeville micropolitan area as the 4th largest-gaining micropolitan area in the country between 2022 and 2023, with a one-year gain of 2,748 and a 2023 population of 148,226. The city is a college town, home to Tennessee Technological University.

==History==
===Early years and establishment===
Before European settlement, the Cookeville area was dominated by the Cherokee tribe since the Paleo-Indian era. The Cherokee used the region as hunting grounds. Cherokee claims to the land in the Cumberland Plateau ended after the Treaty of Tellico was signed in October 1805. The area surrounding Cookeville and Putnam County was first reported to be settled by Virginia and North Carolina longhunters in the late 1700s to early 1800s, most of whom were of English and Scotch-Irish descent. Settlers arrived by Avery&#x27;s Trace, which was known as the Walton Road in the area of present-day Cookeville. Putnam County was established in 1842, formed from parts of White, Overton, Jackson, Smith, and DeKalb Counties after the population increased sufficiently, straining those counties&#x27; abilities to support services to the isolated residents. Entering the 19th century, the area was dominated economically by the rise of agriculture, logging, and timber production. Putnam County reestablished itself in 1854, with the establishment of a county seat required by new Tennessee state law. In the same year, land purchased by Charles Crook became the area where the new county seat was established since it has access to natural springs able to support a town. The city was named Cookeville for Richard Fielding Cooke, a pioneer who settled in the area in 1810. Cooke was twice elected to the state senate, and was influential in establishing Putnam County in 1854.

===Antebellum and Civil War era===
The largely rugged landscape of the Cookeville area made it unsuitable for large-scale farming operations compared to most of the larger Middle Tennessee region. Still, several farming institutions operated in the region, some using African slave laborers. After Tennessee seceded from the United States in 1861, residents of the Cookeville area were divided about the American Civil War. Most opposed secession. Cookeville residents enrolled to assist in both the armies of the Confederacy and the Union. Several aggressions occurred during the war, including the burning of the Putnam County Courthouse in Cookeville&#x27;s city square, the slaying of 20 and capture of 40 Confederate soldiers by Union Army Colonel Henry McConnell, and the Battle of Dug Hill.

Economic and cultural growth in Cookeville stagnated as a result of the political divide over secession, causing animosity among neighbors and families. The tides turned by the late 1800s, after the city&#x27;s first hotel, the Isbell, was completed in 1886, and the Nashville and Knoxville Railroad in 1890.

===20th century===
The investment made by railroad companies placed Cookeville on a path of considerable economic and industrial development with the Nashville and Knoxville railroad, which became the Tennessee Central Railroad. With this growth, Cookeville officially incorporated into a chartered city in 1903. Two years later, the city established the Cookeville Light and Water Department, when electricity was first distributed in the city. In 1909, the Tennessee Central Railroad constructed the Cookeville Depot in the city&#x27;s West Side District, providing passenger rail service until 1955.

In 1909, local religious leaders with the aid of the Tennessee state government established the University of Dixie, a private university deeded to the community. The state government seized the institution in 1915 following decline in enrollment and financial support. The government reestablished it as Tennessee Polytechnic Institute, a public institute of technology focused on education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The university made Cookeville a regional education hub and college town, increasing its population and post-secondary education enrollment. In 1965, it was renamed Tennessee Technological University.

With the advancement rail access, Cookeville began to industrialize with the rise of textile manufacturing, coal mining, and the rapid expansion of the timber production industry. The railroad&#x27;s dominance declined by the beginning of the Great Depression. By 1930, the completion of U.S. Route 70N, the northern branch of U.S. Route 70, Cookeville&#x27;s first modern highway, prompted further expansion of Cookeville&#x27;s industrial and commercial markets. The United States Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; large-scale Center Hill Dam project provided jobs for Cookeville residents, and after its completion, provided advanced electricity production for industrial development, flood control of the nearby Caney Fork River, and recreational sites with the design of Edgar Evins and Burgess Falls state parks.

Other infrastructure additions to the city beneficial to the city&#x27;s growth included a water treatment plant in 1946, the Cookeville General Hospital in 1950, and a wastewater treatment plant in 1952.
During the Jim Crow era of the 1950s, John&#x27;s Place was one business where white and black locals could socialize together. John&#x27;s Place originally opened as Ed&#x27;s Place in 1949, and was later known as McClellan&#x27;s Cafe and finally John&#x27;s Place as of 1957. At 11 Gibson Avenue, off West Spring Street, it was a grocery store and restaurant. John&#x27;s Place is known for its southern cuisine—fried chicken, catfish, meatloaf, and corn bread—as well as beer. Many local white people encountered their first African American at the restaurant. John&#x27;s Place was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

By 1966, the Interstate 40 corridor was completed south of the city center, prompting annexation of several of the freeway&#x27;s interchanges for commercial development. After its end of passenger rail use in 1955, the Cookeville Depot fell into disrepair. A group of local residents and preservationists worked to save the depot from demolition, and the Cookeville city government eventually purchased it. The group responsible for its preservation restored the depot and reopened it as a museum in 1985, the year it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

By the 1970 census, Cookeville&#x27;s population had increased by more than 80% from 1960, as it rose from a predominately rural town into a larger hub city with increased enrollment at Tennessee Technological University and Interstate 40 positioning the city for increased employment opportunities.

The city&#x27;s establishment as the economic hub of the Upper Cumberland region strengthened with the construction and completion of Tennessee State Route 111, also known as Appalachian Development Highway System Corridor J. Corridor J, which went through the engineering phase in 1978 and was completed in the late 1980s, provides expressway-grade access to Cookeville from communities in Overton and White counties.

Throughout the 1990s, the Cookeville Public Works and Engineering Department constructed several collector streets that aided commercial development along the northern side of the I-40 corridor in the city.

===Modern day===

Cookeville embarked on one of its recorded largest expansions of its city limits when it annexed over 10 square miles of previously unincorporated Putnam County between 2000 and 2009. In 2007, city officials approved the purchase of over 400 acres for a regional industrial park known as the Highlands Business Park. In 2008, Cookeville General Hospital, then recently renamed the Cookeville Regional Medical Center, completed a major renovation and expansion project as a result of the city&#x27;s and region&#x27;s population growth.

===2020 tornado===
In the early morning of March 3, 2020, an EF4 tornado touched down west of Cookeville, damaging several of the city&#x27;s western outskirt neighborhoods. It killed 19 people, injured 87, and caused more than $100 million in damages. Tennessee Tech closed for two days, encouraging student volunteers to assist first responders in rescue and clean-up. The tornado&#x27;s estimated maximum wind speed of 175 mph along its nearly nine-mile path was recorded as the strongest storm of the outbreak.

Since Cookeville&#x27;s founding, rail transport was a major part of the economy, and the Tennessee Central Railway connecting Nashville and Knoxville had a major rail depot in the central business district. This railway was used primarily to transport East Tennessee&#x27;s coal and minerals to the midstate region. The coal industry declined during the 1960s, and the Tennessee Central Railway was discontinued in 1968. Construction of a bicycle trail adjacent to the railway&#x27;s path began in 2013, with the reconstruction of the rail depot in Monterey. Plans are to connect this depot and the rail depot in Cookeville&#x27;s central business district (now a museum) with a bicycle trail.

<text>Monterey is a town in Putnam County, Tennessee, United States. Its population was 2,850 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Cookeville, Tennessee micropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Monterey is rooted in a settlement that developed around a landmark known as the &quot;Standing Stone&quot; in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The stone was as a guidepost for travelers along Avery&#x27;s Trace, and is believed to have earlier served as a boundary marker between the territories of the Cherokee and Shawnee. By 1805, three families had settled permanently in area, and the Standing Stone Inn was established to cater to westward-bound migrants.

In the spring of 1864, during the Civil War, 200 Union soldiers led by Colonel William B. Stokes entered the Monterey area with orders to root out Confederate guerrilla activity. On the morning of March 12 of that year, Stokes&#x27; men entered the home of William Alexander Officer near Monterey and killed six of his guests, having accused them of being Confederate guerrillas. A Tennessee Historical Commission marker on Commercial Avenue in Monterey remembers the event.

With the progress of the Tennessee Central Railway coming up the mountain from Cookeville, the Cumberland Mountain Coal Company, a group of 10 investors, bought property that contained coal from T.J. Whittaker. The company was interested in building a new company town to provide housing and commercial ventures for the workers. They hired Maj. Robert John Moscrip to lay out the new town. A contest was held to name it; Moscrip won. The new town was to be named “Monterey”, which meant &quot;King of the Mountains&quot;, and coal was king. Moscrip continued engineering the railroad tracks out the Crawford Branch into Overton County. That line opened by 1894. He was also hired to open coal lands for the Alexander Crawford family up to 1904. A female contractor was hired, which was unheard of at the time, to build a portion of that line.

On the evening of April 3, 2020, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the watershed of the Calfkiller River due to the failure of the dam confining the town&#x27;s municipal lake.

==Geography==
Monterey is located at (36.145291, -85.265757). The town is situated at the western edge of the Cumberland Plateau in eastern Putnam County, just north of the point where the counties of Putnam, White, and Cumberland meet, and just southwest of the point where Putnam, Overton, and Fentress meet. It is located about east of Nashville and the same distance west of Knoxville, and is connected with these two cities by Interstate 40 (exits 300 and 301) and U.S. Route 70. State Route 84 connects Monterey with Livingston to the northwest and Sparta to the southwest. State Route 62 connects Monterey with Clarkrange along U.S. Route 127 to the east, and State Route 164 connects the town with Crawford and the rural areas of the western plateau to the north.

The sources of the Calfkiller River and the Falling Water River are both located just west of Monterey, on opposite sides of I-40.

<text>Dayton is a city in and the county seat of Rhea County, Tennessee, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 7,065. The Dayton Urban Cluster includes developed areas adjacent to the city and extends south to Graysville.

Dayton was the site of the Scopes Trial in 1925 dealing with the rejection of evolution by religious groups.

==History==

The community was originally settled &quot;circa&quot; 1820 as Smith&#x27;s Crossroads. In 1877, the town was renamed Dayton, after Dayton, Ohio. The town was incorporated in 1903. Early industry included manufacture of pig iron.

===Scopes trial===
In 1925, the famous Scopes Trial was held in Dayton and, for a period of time, filled the town with hucksters of every description and journalists from around the world. The participants included William Jennings Bryan in the role of prosecutor and Clarence Darrow as the principal defense counsel. The trial was over the issue of whether evolution should be taught in public schools. John T. Scopes, the defendant in the trial, was a local science teacher who was recruited by George Rappleyea to begin to teach evolution in his science class, and at the provocation of the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union), despite it being against Tennessee law at that time. Rappleyea believed that this conflict would create an enormous amount of publicity for the town, and he was proven correct. The town bustled with activity as people began to flock from near and far to hear the verdict on this controversial issue.

Although this trial is often represented as being pivotal in the movement to allow evolution to be taught in American schools, it actually marked the beginning of a major decline in the teaching of evolution which did not start to recover until the early 1960s. Likewise, the Butler Act, which Scopes was supposed to have violated—though it was never invoked again—remained on the books until 1967, when it was repealed by the Tennessee Legislature.

H. L. Mencken famously covered the trial for the Baltimore &quot;Sun&quot; and recruited Clarence Darrow to lead the defense team.

Immediately after the trial, Bryan continued to edit and deliver speeches, traveling hundreds of miles that week. On July 26, 1925, he drove from Chattanooga to Dayton to attend a church service, ate a meal, and died (the result of diabetes and fatigue) in his sleep that afternoon—just five days after the Scopes trial ended.

<doc id="135334" wikidata="Q2648949" url="?curid=135334" title="Spring City, Tennessee">
<text>Spring City is a town in Rhea County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 1,949 at the 2020 census and 1,981 at the 2010 census. The town is located along Watts Bar Lake, and Watts Bar Dam and the Watts Bar Nuclear Generating Station are nearby.

==History==
Spring City began as a stop along the Cincinnati Southern Railroad in the 1870s. The town was originally named Sulphur Springs, because of the mass amount of sulphur in the water. Sometime later it became &quot;Rheaville,&quot; and later became incorporated with nearby Rhea Springs, and took on the name Rhea Springs. Due to an explosion, much of the town flooded or burnt, and the town relocated to its current location and was renamed Spring City, in honor of the original settlement, Sulphur Springs. The original location now lies at the bottom of a nearby section of Watts Bar Lake. Spring City thrived as a railroad shipping hub during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Its first railroad depot, a simple wooden building constructed in 1879, burned in 1892, and was replaced by a larger one. This second depot was in turn replaced by the current depot, which was completed by the Southern Railway in 1909.

The city received an economic boost in 1942 with the Tennessee Valley Authority&#x27;s completion of Watts Bar Dam and its associated reservoir southeast of the town. That same year saw the completion of the Watts Bar Fossil Plant, TVA&#x27;s first coal-fired plant. In 1973, TVA began building Watts Bar Nuclear Plant. Its first reactor, Watts Bar Unit 1, became active in 1996. The construction of the second reactor, Watts Bar Unit 2, was originally suspended in 1985, but resumed in 2007. It entered commercial operation in October 2016.

On August 22, 1955, 11 schoolchildren were killed, and many others injured, when their school bus was struck by a 103-car freight train at a track crossing in Spring City.

On July 28, 2016, a train hauling coal derailed by the train depot and museum due to a faulty wheel on one of the privately owned coal cars. There were no casualties. A lengthy cleanup followed, where both track crossings in town had to be closed while repairs were made and debris cleared.

==Geography==
Spring City is located at (35.689422, -84.863885).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (1.21%) is water.

<text>Kingston is a city in and the county seat of Roane County, Tennessee, United States. This city is thirty-six miles southwest of Knoxville. It had a population of 5,934 at the 2010 United States census, and is included in the Harriman, Tennessee Micropolitan Statistical Area. Kingston is adjacent to Watts Bar Lake.

==History==
Kingston has its roots in Fort Southwest Point, which was built just south of present-day Kingston in 1792. At the time, Southwest Point was on the fringe of the legal settlement area for Euro-Americans. A Cherokee village, headed by Chief Tollunteeskee, was situated just across the river, at what is now Rockwood. In 1805, Colonel Return J. Meigs, who operated out of Southwest Point, was appointed Cherokee Agent, effectively moving the agency from the Tellico Blockhouse to Southwest Point. The city of Kingston was established on October 23, 1799, as part of an effort to partition Knox County (the initial effort to form a separate county failed, but succeeded two years later). Kingston was named after Major Robert King, an officer at Fort Southwest Point in the 1790s.

On September 21, 1807, Kingston was Tennessee&#x27;s state capital for one day. The Tennessee General Assembly convened in Kingston that day due to an agreement with the Cherokee, who had been told that if the Cherokee Nation ceded the land that is now Roane County, Kingston would become the capital of Tennessee. After adjourning that day, the Assembly resumed meeting in Knoxville.

At the outset of the Civil War in 1861, Kingston was selected as the site of the third session of the East Tennessee Convention, which attempted to form a new, Union-aligned state in East Tennessee. Due to the Confederate occupation of the region, however, this third session, which was scheduled for August 1861, never took place. In October 1861, William B. Carter and several co-conspirators planned the East Tennessee bridge burnings from a command post in Kingston. On November 24, 1863, Confederate Cavalry under Joseph Wheeler numbering about 500–1,000 men tried to take Kingston from the Union in the Battle of Kingston, but they were unsuccessful.

In 1955, the Tennessee Valley Authority completed work on the Kingston Fossil Plant, which at the time was the world&#x27;s largest coal-burning power plant. The plant, which consumes roughly of coal daily, can produce up to 1,456 megawatts of electricity. The plant&#x27;s 1,000-foot (305 m) smokestacks are a familiar sight to those driving on the Roane County stretch of Interstate 40. On December 22, 2008, a impoundment containing fly ash slurry from the power plant broke, spilling more than of waste into the surrounding area.

==Geography==

The town is situated at the confluence of the Clinch, Emory, and Tennessee rivers. These confluences are now part of Watts Bar Lake, a reservoir created by the impoundment of the Tennessee by Watts Bar Dam several miles to the southwest.

Kingston is located near the junction of U.S. Route 70, which connects Kingston with Knoxville to the east and Nashville to the west, and State Route 58, which connects Kingston with Oak Ridge to the northeast and Chattanooga to the south. Interstate 40 passes through Kingston, running roughly parallel to U.S. 70.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 9.56%, is water.

<doc id="135336" wikidata="Q147304" url="?curid=135336" title="North China Plain">
<text>The North China Plain () is a large-scale downfaulted rift basin formed in the late Paleogene and Neogene and then modified by the deposits of the Yellow River. It is the largest alluvial plain of China. The plain is bordered to the north by the Yanshan Mountains, to the west by the Taihang Mountains, to the south by the Dabie Mountains, and to the east by the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea. The Yellow River flows through the plain, before its waters empty into the Bohai Sea.

The part of the North China Plain around the banks of the middle and lower Yellow River is commonly referred to as the Central Plain (). This portion of the North China Plain formed the cradle of Chinese civilization, and is the region from which the Han Chinese people emerged.

Beijing, the capital of China, is located on the northeast edge of the plain, with Tianjin, an important industrial city and commercial port, near its northeast coast. Jinan (the capital of Shandong province) and Zhengzhou (the capital of Henan province) lie on the plain as well, along the banks of the Yellow River. Additionally, the capitals of several Imperial Chinese dynasties were located on the plain, including Luoyang (which at various points was the capital of the Han, Jin, Sui, and Tang dynasties) and Kaifeng (the capital of the Northern Song dynasty).

The multipurpose Xiaolangdi Dam marks the location of the Yellow River&#x27;s last valley before its waters flow onto the North China Plain, a great delta created from silt deposited at the Yellow River&#x27;s mouth over millennia. The North China Plain encompasses much of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces, as well as the northern portions of Jiangsu and Anhui. Further south, the North China Plain merges with the similarly flat Yangtze Delta.

The North China Plain is fertile, and it is one of the most densely populated regions in the world. The plain is one of China&#x27;s most important agricultural regions, producing wheat, maize, sorghum, millet, peanuts, sesame seed, cotton, and various vegetables. It is the main area of sorghum, millet, maize, and cotton production in China. In the eastern part of the plain, Shandong&#x27;s Shengli Oil Field serves as an important petroleum base. Due to its yellow soil, the North China Plain&#x27;s nickname is &quot;Land of the yellow earth&quot;. The plain covers an area of about , most of which is less than above sea level.

==Historical significance==

The geography of the North China Plain has had profound cultural and political implications. Unlike areas to the south of the Yangtze, the plain generally runs uninterrupted by mountains and has far fewer rivers. As a result, communication by horse is rapid within the plain, and the spoken language of the plain is relatively uniform, in contrast to the plethora of languages and dialects in southern China. In addition the possibility of rapid communication has meant that the political center of China has tended to be located here.

Because the fertile soil of the North China Plain gradually merges with the steppes and deserts of Dzungaria, Inner Mongolia, and Northeast China, the plain has been prone to invasion from nomadic or semi-nomadic tribes originating from those regions, prompting the construction of the Great Wall of China. 
Although the soil of the North China Plain is fertile, the weather is unpredictable, being at the intersection of humid winds from the Pacific and dry winds from the interior of the Asian continent. This makes the plain prone to both floods and drought. Moreover, the flatness of the plain promotes massive flooding when river works are damaged. Many historians have proposed that these factors have encouraged the development of a centralized Chinese state to manage granaries, maintain hydraulic works, and administer fortifications against the steppe peoples. (The &quot;hydraulic society&quot; school holds that early states developed in the valleys of the Nile, Euphrates, Indus and Yellow Rivers due to the need to supervise large numbers of laborers to build irrigation canals and control floods.)

Philosophically, the North China Plain was also the birthplace of Confucius, the traditional patriarch of East Asian philosophy. Confucius lived and taught in the State of Lu from 551 to 479 BCE. His teachings, recorded in The Analects, eventually became the school of thought known as Confucianism. Tied to the Classical Chinese writing system, Confucianism swept throughout China and onto Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, heavily influencing their respective political, legal, and educational bureaucracies.

=== Modern history ===
The initial project of the Great Leap Forward was accelerating the construction of waterworks on the North China Plain during the 1957–1958 winter.

== Climate change ==
As climate change increases the Earth&#x27;s average temperature, and has a disproportionate effect on extreme temperatures, it will also increase heat stress felt in areas that are already hot and/or with high humidity. The North China Plain is expected to be highly affected, as the region&#x27;s extensive irrigation networks result in unusually moist air. In scenarios without aggressive action to stop climate change, the worst heatwaves are projected to become severe enough to cause mass mortality in agricultural labourers working outdoors. Under the most extreme climate change scenario, the warming reached by 2100 would be sufficient to cause such heatwaves across the North China Plain approximately once per decade.

<text>Rockwood is a city in Roane County, Tennessee, United States. Its population was 5,562 at the time of the 2010 census. It is included in the Harriman, Tennessee Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Rockwood is located at (35.869147, -84.675176). The city is situated at the base of the eastern escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau, known locally as Walden Ridge. The boundary between the Eastern Time Zone and Central Time Zone runs along Rockwood&#x27;s western boundary. The Watts Bar Lake impoundment of the Tennessee River provides much of Rockwood&#x27;s southern boundary.

Rockwood is situated around a series of roads which intersect U.S. Route 70 between its junction with State Route 29 in the northeast and State Route 27 to the southwest. In recent years, the town has expanded toward Interstate 40 to the northeast. Rockwood is a familiar site to travelers who frequent I-40 between Knoxville and Nashville, as dramatic views of Rockwood and the Tennessee Valley beyond line the interstate just before it peaks at the edge of the Cumberland Plateau.

==History==

===Early history===
A Cherokee village situated in what is now Rockwood was the headquarters of Chief Tallentuskie, a Cherokee leader in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

===Roane Iron Company===
Union general John T. Wilder, who in the 1850s had managed a foundry in Indiana, noted the iron ore and coal deposits of the Cumberland Plateau region while operating in the area during the Civil War. After the war, Wilder and Ohio-born Knoxville Iron Company founder Hiram Chamberlain (1835–1916) purchased at what is now Rockwood, selecting the location due to the ore and coal resources at the base of Walden Ridge, the proximity to the Tennessee River, and an assumption that the encroaching railroads would descend the Plateau at nearby Emory Gap. Wilder and Chamberlain enlisted several other investors from Indiana and Ohio, and the Roane Iron Company was chartered on June 18, 1867. By late 1868, the company had constructed a blast furnace with a capacity of 15 tons per day between the ridge and the end of what is now Rockwood Street.

The company mined coal and iron ore along the ridge, which it transported by narrow-gauge rail to the furnace site. The coal was delivered to coking ovens, where it was converted into coke, and the coke was then used to generate the temperatures needed to convert the iron ore into pig iron. The pig iron was then shipped by river to rolling mills in Knoxville and Chattanooga, and was used primarily in railroad construction. In the early 1880s, Roane Iron purchased a rolling mill in Chattanooga and experimented with steel production, but the Walden Ridge ore proved to be too low-quality for such a process, and the company abandoned its steel venture in 1889.

Roane Iron&#x27;s Rockwood furnace employed a mix of local labor (both caucasian and African-American) and immigrants (especially Welsh immigrants), and did not practice wage discrimination. The company paid workers either cash, which was issued on paydays, or scrip, which could be issued anytime at the worker&#x27;s request. Other than a miners&#x27; strike in 1904, Roane Iron experienced relatively few labor disputes, even though labor organizations were active in Rockwood. A series of mining accidents— namely a 1926 mine explosion— damaged the company&#x27;s image and led to out-of-control workers&#x27; compensation payments, however, and in 1929 Roane Iron shut down operations.

===Development of Rockwood===

Worried that the region&#x27;s Confederate-sympathizers might shun an operation led by a well-known Union general, Wilder decided to name Roane Iron&#x27;s company town after one of its lesser-known Indiana investors, William O. Rockwood. In spite of the name, William Rockwood played only a minor role in Roane Iron&#x27;s affairs, and the early development of the town was largely the work of Wilder and Chamberlain. Unlike the &quot;boom&quot; towns in nearby Cardiff and Harriman, Rockwood&#x27;s growth was gradual. Rockwood&#x27;s population grew from 696 in 1870 to 1,011 in 1880. By 1890, the city&#x27;s population had swelled to 2,305.

For the first 50 years of its existence, Rockwood was polarized by the temperance issue. Wilder, a prohibitionist, banned alcoholic beverages on company property, and tried in vain to prevent drunkenness in the town throughout the 1870s. Saloons became commonplace in Rockwood in the 1880s, however, and Roane Iron began to struggle with absenteeism, as many employees worked for just a few days per week in order to make enough money for a &quot;weekend of drinking and fighting.&quot; In 1887, after the state&#x27;s &quot;four-mile&quot; law effectively banned saloons in unincorporated areas, a section of the town incorporated as &quot;East Rockwood&quot; to dodge the law. Rockwood, which incorporated in 1890, passed an ordinance banning the sale of alcohol in 1903, but the ordinance didn&#x27;t apply to railroads, and the so-called &quot;jug train&quot; from Chattanooga continued supplying Rockwood with liquor until the statewide prohibition law took effect in 1909.

Noting the success of land auctions in nearby Cardiff and Harriman, Roane Iron held its own land auction for Rockwood in May 1890, selling several hundred lots and raising $600,000. To promote the city, the company laid out new streets, built new hotels, and allowed general stores to set up shop in the city and compete with the company store. These de-paternalization measures helped Rockwood survive the Panic of 1893, which doomed neighboring Cardiff.

===20th century===

In the early 20th century, Rockwood&#x27;s economy further diversified. Former Roane Iron employee James Tarwater founded Rockwood Mills, which manufactured hosiery, in 1905. Another former Roane Iron employee, Sewell Howard, established Rockwood Stove Works in 1916.

On October 4, 1926, twenty-eight people were killed in a mine explosion in the area.

After Roane Iron&#x27;s collapse in 1929, Rockwood struggled with unemployment. At the outbreak of World War II, however, the Tennessee Products Corporation reopened the iron works to produce ferromanganese for the wartime effort. Like other Roane County communities, Rockwood&#x27;s economy was boosted by the government&#x27;s construction of nearby Oak Ridge during World War II.

<text>Adams is a city in Robertson County, Tennessee, United States. It is near the Kentucky state line. The population was 624 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The first settlers in what is now Adams arrived in the late 18th century. The Red River Baptist Church, one of the first churches founded west of the Cumberland Plateau, was built on the banks of the Red River in 1791. The congregation relocated to its current location on Church Street in 1898.

Adams developed in the late 1850s as a station on the Edgefield and Kentucky Railroad (later part of the L&amp;N system). Most of the city&#x27;s early buildings were destroyed during the Civil War. The city originally incorporated as Red River in 1869, but was renamed Adams Station in honor of James Reuben Adams, who owned much of the land on which the city was built. The name was simplified to &quot;Adams&quot; in 1898. By the late 1880s, Adams was home to several stores, a flour mill, two churches, and a school. The city repealed its charter in 1899, but reincorporated in 1908, and incorporated as a city in 1963.

During the 1920s, Adams began to receive a steady flow of automobile traffic due to its location along U.S. Route 41, which was one of the main roads linking the Chicago area with Florida. The city began to decline in the mid 20th century with the discontinuance of passenger rail traffic and the construction of Interstate 24 and Interstate 65 (which drew much of the automobile traffic away from US 41).

Adams is the site of an infamous haunting, the Bell Witch. The first manifestations of the Bell Witch haunting supposedly occurred in 1817 through 1820 on a farm owned by John Bell. A memorial to the Bell family can be found at Bellwood Cemetery. The city&#x27;s municipal offices are now located in the former Bell School, which was built in 1920 and named for a descendant of John Bell. A log cabin built by John Bell around 1810 has been relocated to a plot across from the Bell School.

==Geography==
The city is situated in northwestern Robertson County at the intersection of U.S. Route 41, which connects Adams with Springfield to the southeast and Guthrie, Kentucky, to the northwest, and State Route 76, which connects Adams with Clarksville to the southwest. The city&#x27;s boundaries stretch northward and westward to the Red River, a tributary of the Cumberland River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Cedar Hill is a city in Robertson County, Tennessee, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 301.

==History==

Jo Byrns, who became Speaker of the House of Representatives, was born in Cedar Hill on July 28, 1869. The local elementary school and high school are named for him.

In the 1940s and 1950s Cedar Hill had a population of about 700, with around 10 stores. The economy was based on services to surrounding farmers; the main crop in the area was tobacco.

By the 1960s, crops were more diversified and more farmers had cars, enabling them to travel to the county seat of Springfield, about nine miles away. Also at about this time, the construction of the Interstate Highway System, namely Interstate 24 and Interstate 65, removed much of Cedar Hill&#x27;s through traffic. These factors led to a steady decline in population and development, but the area has begun to move forward in a positive direction through community building and revitalization efforts.

In 2006, Jo Byrns Elementary School opened in Cedar Hill, serving grade Pre-K to 5.

In 2011, Cedar Hill was recognized by “Only In Your State” as the 9th teeny tiny town in Tennessee that truly make the south a beautiful place to live – good people call these places home, and they&#x27;re the kind of people you want to meet. https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/tennessee/visit-tn-small-towns/amp/

==Geography==
Cedar Hill is located along U.S. Route 41 in northwestern Robertson County. Springfield lies to the southeast, and Adams lies to the northwest.

The Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency owns the Cedar Hill Swamp WMA site which features early- to late-successional hardwood forest dominated by pin oak and sweetgum that dominate the 200 acres found at Cedar Hill Swamp WMA. A few acres of overgrown fields are found near the entrance.

The only remaining swampland is on private property adjacent to the WMA on the opposite side of the CSX railroad tracks.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<doc id="135341" wikidata="Q2394167" url="?curid=135341" title="Coopertown, Tennessee">
<text>Coopertown is a town in southern Robertson County. Located in Middle Tennessee, Coopertown is part of the Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin, TN Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2020 census, the population was 4,480.

== Speed trap reputation ==
In January 2006, Coopertown was called &quot;one of the more blatant examples of speed traps&quot; in the country by a spokesperson for the National Motorists Association (NMA). The town&#x27;s mayor, Danny Crosby, defended the increased enforcement of lowered speed limits, citing the need to combat speeders using Highway 49 as a shortcut between I-24 and I-65.

A complaint and writ of ouster filed by the State of Tennessee on June 27, 2006, noted that comment from the NMA. That complaint seeks to remove Crosby from office, due to acts of willful misconduct related to the speed traps, as well as other abuses of power.

The trial court dismissed the petition, reinstated Crosby as mayor of the City of Coopertown, and awarded Crosby his discretionary costs. An appeal was heard September 7, 2007.

In January 2008, the Tennessee Court of Appeals ruled that even though &quot;the trial court accurately characterized conduct attributable to Crosby as &#x27;bigotry, sexism, or utter foolishness&#x27;&quot;, the plaintiff failed to prove by &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot; that Crosby &quot;knowingly or willfully&quot; committed the type of misconduct essential to establish the requisite statutory grounds to remove a public official from office.

==History==
The tribal identities of the 16th and 17th century Native American occupants of present-day Tennessee are disputed.
In later years, the part of Middle Tennessee that was to become the Coopertown community was claimed as territorial hunting grounds by both the Cherokee and the Chickasaw. That area was at the southern edge of what became known as the Transylvania Purchase, land purchased in 1775 from the Cherokee by Richard Henderson, a North Carolina land speculator seeking to establish a 14th colony.

David Naive settled there in 1825, and the area became known as Naive&#x27;s Crossroads. During subsequent years, the county&#x27;s involvement in the production of barrels and whiskey led to the establishment of one or more cooper shops in the community, making barrels for the nearby Red River mills. The presence of coopers led to the community&#x27;s present name.

Coopertown was officially incorporated in 1996, a decision taken by the citizens of the community in response to a proposal to locate a landfill in the community. In August 2005, Coopertown Middle School opened, serving grades 6 to 8, and in 2007, grades 4 and 5 would move to the middle school.

In July 2016, ground breaking occurred with Lowe&#x27;s to build a 1.2 million sq. ft. fulfillment distribution center to employ 400 people and ramping up to 600 people. The facility opened in July 2018. It is located on York Rd. which is off I-24 at exit 24.

<text>Cross Plains is a city in Robertson County, Tennessee. The city&#x27;s population was 1,789 at the 2020 census. Cross Plains was the first area of Robertson County that was settled by European settlers, with the arrival of Thomas Kilgore in 1778.

==History==
In 1778, American Revolutionary War veteran Thomas Kilgore arrived at the Middle Fork of Red River, three-fourths of a mile west of Cross Plains, making him the first European settler to arrive in Robertson County. Kilgore traveled to this area to claim 640 acres of land, which was guaranteed to settlers who traveled west by the Legislature of North Carolina. Kilgore returned to eastern North Carolina in the fall of 1778, and after the title of his land was confirmed, he traveled back to his settlement with a few other families, and built a stockade which would be known as Kilgore Station. The first building was a double log house erected by William Randolph in 1819. It was also used as a tavern.

In 1873, J.M. Walton established Neophogen College, a private university which operated until 1877. Thomas Drugs opened in 1915; it is one of the oldest establishments in Cross Plains.

In 2004, construction began on &quot;Kilgore Park&quot; located beside East Robertson High School. Construction was completed in 2008. In 2020, the Cross Plains city government announced that they had purchased 148 acres of land on Highway 25 west of Kilgore Park for $1.08 million. City officials stated that the land was purchased for future uses such as an expansion of Kilgore Park, or new schools.

===Transportation===
;Highways

* Interstate 65
* / U.S. Route 31W / Tennessee State Route 41
* Tennessee State Route 25

Decommissioned highways
* Tennessee State Route 79

The major east-west route, State Route 25 (SR 25), is a thoroughfare between Springfield and Gallatin. Interstate 65 (I-65) is a major north-south route between Louisville, Kentucky and Nashville. It intersects SR 25 on exit 112. US 31W, the predecessor to I-65, runs east of the latter route parallel to it. It provides an alternate route for local drivers to White House and Portland.

;History

In the late 19th century, two major stagecoach routes ran through Cross Plains. The Louisville and Nashville Turnpike ran on the eastern end of town on the border of Robertson and Sumner County and the Hopkinsville and Gallatin Road ran through downtown and east toward Gallatin. The first state route to run through the modern Cross Plains area was State Route 79 in the 1920s, it ran on the old Louisville and Nashville Turnpike. State Route 79 was replaced by U.S. Route 31W in November 1926. The second and last state route to be routed through Cross Plains was State Route 25 which was extended west of Gallatin to Cross Plains by 1939. It replaced the Hopkinsville and Gallatin Road. Around 1953, the original curvy routing of US 31W was replaced by a straighter and more direct route. This rerouting abandoned a stone bridge that has been used since at least 1841. Segments of the old road still see use today as simply &quot;Old Highway 31W&quot;. Construction on I-65 near Cross Plains began around 1970. By December 1972, the section south of Cross Plains was complete. Beginning in 2021, the section of Interstate 65 became subject to widening to alleviate traffic strains.

==History==
US 431 and US 41 have had different routes through Springfield. US 41 formerly had a more eastern route, now called Old Greenbrier Road. A portion of the old route was abandoned in the 1990s due to landscaping made during the construction of a railroad. The practical usage of the road was replaced by the 17th Avenue Connector. The old pavement is still visible from Bill Jones Industrial Drive. Beyond that, it ran more westernly through downtown Springfield, now called Batts Boulevard and Main Street. A portion of the old route north of downtown was removed due to the construction of a quarry. US 41 was rerouted onto Memorial Boulevard, a 4 lane highway, around 1961 after its completion.

US 431 followed a more eastern route prior to at least 2010 south of Springfield. This route had a different bridge crossing Carr Creek that has since been demolished. North of the bridge, it followed what is now called Main Street. It intersected US 41 at the junction of what is now Main Street, A C Street, and 11th Avenue. It ran with US 41 after this intersection, until its own rerouting on Memorial Boulevard in 1961. US 431 was rerouted onto Tom Austin Highway around 1983.

<text>Murfreesboro is a city in, and county seat of, Rutherford County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 165,430 according to the 2023 census, up from 108,755 residents certified in 2010. Murfreesboro is located in the Nashville metropolitan area of Middle Tennessee, southeast of downtown Nashville.

It served as the state capital from 1818 to 1826. Today, it is the largest suburb of Nashville and the sixth-most populous city in Tennessee. The city is both the center of population and the geographic center of Tennessee.

Since the 1990s, Murfreesboro has been Tennessee&#x27;s fastest-growing major city and one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. Murfreesboro is home to Middle Tennessee State University, one of the largest undergraduate universities in the state of Tennessee, with 20,540 total students as of fall 2024. 

==History==

On October 27, 1811, the Tennessee General Assembly designated the location for a new county seat for Rutherford County, giving it the name Cannonsburgh in honor of Newton Cannon, representative to the Assembly for the local area. At the suggestion of William Lytle, it was renamed Murfreesborough on November 29, 1811, after Revolutionary War hero Colonel Hardy Murfree, great-grandfather of author Mary Noailles Murfree. The name was shortened to Murfreesboro in January 1812 when the town was formally chartered.

As Tennessee settlement expanded to the west, the location of the state capital in Knoxville became inconvenient for much of the population. In 1818, Murfreesboro was designated as the capital of Tennessee and its population boomed. Eight years later, however, it was superseded by Nashville.

===Civil War===
On December 31, 1862, the Battle of Stones River, also called the Battle of Murfreesboro, was fought near the city between the Union Army of the Cumberland and the Confederate Army of Tennessee. This was a major engagement of the American Civil War, and between December 31 and January 2, 1863, the rival armies suffered a combined total of 23,515 casualties. It was the bloodiest battle of the war by percentage of casualties.

Following the Confederate retreat after the drawn Battle of Perryville in central Kentucky, the Confederate army moved through East Tennessee and turned northwest to defend Murfreesboro. General Braxton Bragg&#x27;s veteran cavalry successfully harassed Union General William Rosecrans″ troop movements, capturing and destroying many of his supply trains. However, they could not completely prevent supplies and reinforcements from reaching Rosecrans. Despite the large number of casualties, the battle was inconclusive. It is usually considered a Union victory, since afterward General Bragg retreated south to Tullahoma. Even so, the Union army did not move against Bragg until six months later, in June 1863. The battle was significant since the Union gained a base from which it could push its eventual drive further south, which enabled its later advances against Chattanooga and Atlanta. The Union eventually divided the territory into the Eastern and Western theaters, followed by Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea through the South. The Stones River National Battlefield is now a national historical site.

General Rosecrans&#x27; move to the south depended on a secure source of provisions, and Murfreesboro was chosen for his supply depot. Soon after the battle, Brigadier General James St. Clair Morton, Chief Engineer of the Army of the Cumberland, was ordered to build Fortress Rosecrans, some northwest of the town. The fortifications covered about and were the largest built during the war. Fortress Rosecrans consisted of eight lunettes, four redoubts, and connecting fortifications. The fortress was built around the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad and the West Fork of the Stones River; two roads provided additional access and transportation.

The fort&#x27;s interior was a huge logistical resource center, including sawmills, warehouses, quartermaster maintenance depots, ammunition magazines, and living quarters for the 2,000 men who handled the operations and defended the post. After the fortress was completed in June 1863, Rosecrans ventured to the south. The fortress was never attacked, in part because the Union troops held the town of Murfreesboro hostage by training their artillery on the courthouse. Major portions of the earthworks still exist and have been incorporated into the battlefield historic site.

===Post-Civil War===
Murfreesboro was first developed as a mainly agricultural community, but by 1853 the area was home to several colleges and academies. Despite the wartime trauma, the town&#x27;s growth had begun to recover by the early 1900s, in contrast to other areas of the devastated South.

In 1911, the state legislature created Middle Tennessee State Normal School, a two-year institute to train teachers. It soon merged with the Tennessee College for Women. In 1925 the Normal School was expanded to a full, four-year curriculum and college. With additional expansion of programs and addition of graduate departments, in 1965 it became Middle Tennessee State University. MTSU now has the largest undergraduate enrollment in the state, including many international students.

World War II was an impetus for industrial development, and Murfreesboro diversified into industry, manufacturing, and education. Growth has been steady since that time, creating a stable economy.

Since the last decade of the 20th century, Murfreesboro has enjoyed substantial residential and commercial growth, with its population increasing 123.9% between 1990 and 2010, from 44,922 to 108,755. The city has been a destination for many refugee immigrants who have left areas affected by warfare; since 1990 numerous people from Somalia and Kurds from Iraq have settled there. The city has also attracted numerous international students to the university.

====Mosque controversy====

Beginning in 2010, the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro faced protests related to its plan to build a new mosque. The county planning council had approved the project, but opposition grew in the aftermath, affected by this being a year of elections. Signs on the building site were vandalized, with the first saying &quot;not welcome&quot; sprayed across it and the second being cut in two. Construction equipment was also torched by arsonists.

In August 2011, a Rutherford County judge upheld his previous decision allowing the mosque to be built, noting the US constitutional right to religious freedom and the ICM&#x27;s observance of needed process. The center has a permanent membership of around 250 families and a few hundred students from the university. The case ultimately attracted national media attention as an issue of religious freedom.

====2023 ordinance on homosexuality====
In June 2023 the city passed an ordinance banning &#x27;public homosexuality&#x27; as &#x27;indecent&#x27;. In October 2023, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed suit against the city, in response to the ban and, in December 2023, the ordinance was repealed.

<text>Smyrna is a town in Rutherford County, Tennessee. Smyrna&#x27;s population was 53,070 at the 2020 census, making it the largest town in Tennessee by population in that census. In 2007, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; listed Smyrna as one of the best places in the United States to retire. Smyrna is part of the Nashville metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
The town of Smyrna has its European American roots in the early 19th century and began as an agrarian community. It was important during the Civil War because its railroad station lies between Nashville and Chattanooga. One of the major events of the war for the town involved the Confederate States soldier Sam Davis, who, after being charged with spying, gave up his life instead of giving any information to the Union Army. He was captured November 20, 1863, and was hanged by Union forces on November 27 of that year. The Sam Davis Plantation, located on of well-maintained farmland, is the town&#x27;s most important historical site.

Smyrna was originally incorporated in 1869 but its charter was rescinded by the state several years later. In 1915, the town re-incorporated and adopted a commission-mayor form of government.

In 1941 during World War II, Sewart Air Force Base was established here and served as a B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 advanced training facility. During the 1950s and 1960s, the military personnel and dependents totaled more than 10,000 persons stationed at the base. The base was scheduled for closing in 1971. Most of the property was divided among the State of Tennessee, Rutherford County, and the Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority. On its portion, the state opened and operates a Tennessee Army National Guard base and the Tennessee Rehabilitation Center. Much of the additional land was developed as the Smyrna/Rutherford County Airport Authority in 1990.

During the 1970s, many new industries moved to the area. The city began a period of growth stimulated by production of such companies as Better Built Aluminum, Cumberland Swan (currently known as Vi-Jon, Inc.), and Square D building plants. In the early 1980s, Nissan Motors constructed a manufacturing plant in the city, and in 1983, the first vehicle was produced. The Nissan plant now employs around 8,400 workers, has a production capacity of 640,000 vehicles annually, and covers an area of . In 2012, Smyrna began manufacturing Nissan&#x27;s electric car, the Nissan Leaf, and its batteries.

On March 14, 2000, the mayor and board of commissioners adopted a new charter. The city now operates under the city manager form of government, whereby the commissioners hire a city manager for daily operations.

On June 2, 2016 Blue Angels #6 crashed in Smyrna when practicing for the Great Tennessee Air show, killing pilot Capt. Jeff Kuss, USMC. The people of Smyrna raised funds to have a memorial built in his honor. The Capt. Jeff Kuss USMC Memorial sits across from the Smyrna Airport, where Capt. Kuss departed on his tragic final flight, and the centerpiece is a retired F/A-18 Hornet loaned to Smyrna from the United States Navy, painted in the colors of the Blue Angels performance squadron with Capt. Kuss&#x27; name under the cockpit hatch and the number 6 on the tails to represent which plane he flew on his final flight.

<text>Huntsville is a town in Scott County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 1,270 at the 2020 census and 1,248 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Scott County.

==History==

Huntsville was named after a long hunter known only by the surname &quot;Hunt.&quot; This long hunter camped under a rock shelter in the mid-18th century and later moved his family to the area. When Scott County was formed in 1849, Huntsville was chosen as the county seat due to the site&#x27;s central location within the new county as well as an excellent spring that flowed across the property.

During the U.S. Civil War, Scott County was staunchly pro-Union. In Tennessee&#x27;s June 1861 referendum on secession, the county voted 541–19 against secession, the highest percentage of any county in Tennessee. In spite of fierce opposition from Scott and other East Tennessee counties, the ordinance passed and Tennessee seceded from the Union. Later that year, Scott County voted unanimously to secede from Tennessee and formed the Independent State of Scott.

In 1906, a new courthouse square was built in Huntsville using a beige-colored native sandstone for the buildings&#x27; outer walls. Although the courthouse burned in 1946, two of these sandstone buildings remain— the First National Bank building and the Old Scott County Jail. Both have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Baker family, which arrived in the Huntsville area shortly after the Civil War, has been active in state and national politics for several decades. James F. Baker (1864–1934) was a successful attorney and newspaper publisher. Baker&#x27;s son, Howard H. Baker, Sr. (1902–1964), was the Republican candidate for governor of Tennessee in 1938 and later served in the U.S. House of Representatives. Howard H. Baker, Jr. (1925-2014), son of Howard Sr., was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1966 and gained national attention as Vice Chairman of the Senate Watergate Committee in 1973. Baker later served as Senate Majority Leader (1981–1985) and White House Chief of Staff (1987–1988).

==Geography==

Huntsville is surrounded by low mountains and hills that comprise the southern section of the Cumberland Mountains.

Huntsville&#x27;s town center is situated along State Route 63 (SR 63, Howard Baker Highway), although the town&#x27;s municipal boundaries stretch westward to SR 63&#x27;s junction with U.S. Route 27 (US 27, Scott Highway).

<text>Dunlap is a city in and the county seat of Sequatchie County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 5,357 at the 2020 census and 4,815 at the 2010 census.

Dunlap is part of the Chattanooga metropolitan area.

==History==

Dunlap was founded in 1858 as a county seat for Sequatchie County, which had been created the previous year. The city was named for state legislator William Claiborne Dunlap, who played a prominent role in the county&#x27;s creation. The city&#x27;s initial , which were deeded to the county commissioners by Willam Rankin, were chosen due to their central location within the new county. Dunlap was incorporated as a city in 1941.

Around 1900, the Douglas Coal and Coke Company purchased of land in the Dunlap vicinity with plans to mine coal and convert the coal into industrial coke. Coke, which is created by heating coal and removing its volatile matter, is used primarily as a deoxidizing agent in the production of pig iron. To convert coal mined on nearby Fredonia Mountain into coke, Douglas built the first of 268 ovens. The company used an incline railway to move the coal from the mountain to the ovens. Although Douglas went bankrupt in 1904, the Chattanooga Iron and Coal Company purchased the ovens, and continued producing coke until 1927. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Sequatchie Valley Historical Association acquired the ruins of the coke ovens and established Dunlap Coke Ovens Park.

==Geography==
Dunlap is located at (35.377236, -85.388455). The city is located near the center of Sequatchie Valley, a narrow, valley that slices through the Cumberland Plateau in southeastern Tennessee and northeastern Alabama.

The Sequatchie River forms the city&#x27;s southeastern boundary.

U.S. Route 127 (called &quot;Rankin Avenue&quot; in Dunlap), which traverses much of the Tennessee section of Sequatchie Valley, connects Dunlap to Pikeville and Crossville to the north and Chattanooga opposite Signal Mountain to the southeast. S.R. 28, which intersects with U.S. 127 in Dunlap, connects the city to Jasper to the southwest. S.R. 111, which intersects US 127 a few miles north of Dunlap, connects the city to Chattanooga to the southeast and Spencer atop the plateau to the west.

<doc id="135357" wikidata="Q1008520" url="?curid=135357" title="Gatlinburg, Tennessee">
<text>Gatlinburg is a city in Sevier County, Tennessee, United States. It is located southeast of Knoxville and had a population of 3,577 at the 2020 census. It is a popular mountain resort town, as it rests on the border of Great Smoky Mountains National Park along U.S. Route 441.

==History==

===Early history===

For centuries, Cherokee hunters, as well as other Native American hunters before them, used a footpath known as the Indian Gap Trail to access the abundant game in the forests and coves of the Smokies. This trail connected the Great Indian Warpath with Rutherford Indian Trace, following the West Fork of the Little Pigeon River from modern-day Sevierville through modern-day Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg, and the Sugarlands, crossing the crest of the Smokies along the slopes of Mount Collins, and descending into North Carolina along the banks of the Oconaluftee River. US-441 largely follows this same route today, although it crests at Newfound Gap rather than Indian Gap.

Although various 18th-century European and early American hunters and fur trappers probably traversed or camped in the flats where Gatlinburg is now situated, it was Edgefield, South Carolina, native William Ogle (1751–1803) who first decided to permanently settle in the area. With the help of the Cherokee, Ogle cut, hewed, and notched logs in the flats, planning to erect a cabin the following year. He returned home to Edgefield to retrieve his family and grow one final crop for supplies. However, shortly after his arrival in Edgefield, a malaria epidemic swept the low country, and Ogle succumbed to the disease in 1803.

His widow, Martha Huskey Ogle (1756–1827), moved the family to Virginia, where she had relatives. Sometime around 1806, Martha Huskey Ogle made the journey over Indian Gap Trail to what is now Gatlinburg with her brother, Peter Huskey, her daughter, Rebecca, and her daughter&#x27;s husband, James McCarter. William Ogle&#x27;s notched logs awaited them, and they erected a cabin near the confluence of Baskins Creek and the West Fork of the Little Pigeon shortly after their arrival. The cabin still stands today near the heart of Gatlinburg. James and Rebecca McCarter settled in the Cartertown district of Gatlinburg.

In the decade following the arrival of the Ogles, McCarters, and Huskeys in what came to be known as White Oak Flats, a steady stream of settlers moved into the area. Most were veterans of the American Revolution or War of 1812 who had converted the tracts they had received for service in war into deeds. Among these early settlers were Timothy Reagan (c. 1750–1830), John Ownby Jr. (1791–1857), and Henry Bohanon (1760–1842). Their descendants still live in the area today.

===Radford Gatlin and the Civil War===

In 1856, a post office was established in the general store of Radford Gatlin (c. 1798–1880), giving the town the name Gatlinburg. Even though the town bore his name, Gatlin, who didn&#x27;t arrive in the flats until around 1854, constantly bickered with his neighbors. By 1857, a full-blown feud had erupted between the Gatlins and the Ogles, probably over Gatlin&#x27;s attempts to divert the town&#x27;s main road. The eve of the U.S. Civil War found Gatlin, who became a Confederate sympathizer, at odds with the residents of the flats, who were mostly pro-Union, and he was forced out in 1859.

Despite its anti-slavery sentiments, Gatlinburg, like most Smoky communities, tried to remain neutral during the war. This changed when a company of Confederate Colonel William Holland Thomas&#x27; Legion occupied the town to protect the saltpeter mines at Alum Cave, near the Tennessee-North Carolina border. Federal forces marched south from Knoxville and Sevierville to drive out Thomas&#x27; men, who had built a small fort on Burg Hill. Lucinda Oakley Ogle, whose grandfather witnessed the ensuing skirmish, later recounted her grandfather&#x27;s recollections:
... he told me about when he was a sixteen-year-old boy during the Civil War and would hide under a big cliff on Turkey Nest Ridge and watch the Blue Coats ride their horses around the graveyard hill, shooting their cannon toward Burg Hill where the Grey Coats had a fort and would ride their horses around the Burg Hill ...

As the Union forces converged on the town, the outnumbered Confederates were forced to retreat across the Smokies to North Carolina. Confederate forces did not return, although sporadic small raids continued until the end of the war.

===Early 20th century===
In the 1880s, the invention of the bandsaw and the logging railroad led to a boom in the lumber industry. As forests throughout the Southeastern United States were harvested, lumber companies pushed deeper into the mountain areas of the Appalachian highlands. In 1901, Colonel W.B. Townsend established the Little River Lumber Company in Tuckaleechee Cove to the west, and lumber interests began buying up logging rights to vast tracts of forest in the Smokies.

Andrew Jackson Huff (1878–1949), originally of Greene County, was a pivotal figure in Gatlinburg at this time. Huff erected a sawmill in Gatlinburg in 1900, and local residents began supplementing their income by providing lodging to loggers and other lumber company officials. Tourists also began to trickle into the area, drawn to the Smokies by the writings of authors such as Mary Noailles Murfree and Horace Kephart, who wrote extensively about the region&#x27;s natural wonders.

In 1912, the Pi Beta Phi women&#x27;s fraternity established a settlement school (now Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts) in Gatlinburg after a survey of the region found the town to be most in need of educational facilities in the area. Although skeptical locals were initially worried that the fraternity might be religious propagandists or opportunists, the school&#x27;s enrollment grew from 33 to 134 in its first year of operation. Along with providing basic education to children in the area, the school&#x27;s staff created a small market for local crafts.

Isolation in the region attracted folklorists such as Cecil Sharp of London to the area in the years following World War I. Sharp&#x27;s collection of Appalachian ballads was published in 1932.

Extensive logging in the early 1900s led to increased calls by conservationists for federal action, and in 1911, Congress passed the Weeks Act to allow for the purchase of land for national forests. Authors such as Horace Kephart and Knoxville-area businesses began advocating for the creation of a national park in the Smokies that would be similar to Yellowstone or Yosemite in the Western United States. With the purchase of in the Little River Lumber Company tract in 1926, the movement quickly became a reality.

Andrew Huff spearheaded the movement in the Gatlinburg area, and he opened the first hotel in Gatlinburg – the Mountain View Hotel – in 1916. His son, Jack, established LeConte Lodge atop Mount Le Conte in 1926. In spite of resistance from lumberers at Elkmont and difficulties with the Tennessee legislature, Great Smoky Mountains National Park opened in 1934.

The park radically changed Gatlinburg. When the Pi Beta Phis arrived in 1912, Gatlinburg was a small hamlet with six houses, a blacksmith shop, a general store, a Baptist church, and a greater community of 600 individuals, most of whom lived in log cabins. In 1934, the first year the park was open, an estimated 40,000 visitors passed through the city. Within a year, this number had increased over twelvefold to 500,000. From 1940 to 1950, the cost per acre of land in Gatlinburg increased from $50 () to $8,000 ().

While the park&#x27;s arrival benefited Gatlinburg and made many of the town&#x27;s residents wealthy, the tourism explosion led to problems with air quality and urban sprawl. Even in modern times, the town&#x27;s infrastructure is often pushed to the limit on peak vacation days and must consistently adapt to accommodate the growing number of tourists.

===Fire of 1992===
On the night of July 14, 1992, Gatlinburg gained national attention when an entire city block burned to the ground due to faulty wiring in a light fixture. The Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! museum was consumed by the fire, along with an arcade, haunted house, and souvenir shop. The blaze was stopped before it could consume the adjacent 32-story Gatlinburg Space Needle. Known to locals as &quot;Rebel Corner,&quot; the block was completely rebuilt and reopened to visitors in 1995. Few artifacts from the Ripley&#x27;s Museum were salvaged, and those that survived are marked with that designation in the new museum. The fire prompted new downtown building codes and a new downtown fire station. Ripley&#x27;s has caught fire twice since it reopened, once in 2000 and again in 2003. Both of those fires, coincidentally, were caused by faulty light fixtures. The 2000 fire caused no damage, and the 2003 fire was contained to the building&#x27;s exterior, with the museum suffering minimal damage, primarily cosmetic.

===Fire of 2016===


Starting in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park at Chimney Tops in November 2016, a moderately contained wildfire was compounded by very strong winds – with gusts recorded up to – and extremely dry conditions due to drought, causing it to spread down into Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Pittman Center, and other nearby areas. It forced mass evacuations, and Governor Bill Haslam ordered the National Guard to the area. The center of Gatlinburg&#x27;s tourist district escaped heavy damage, but the surrounding wooded region was called &quot;the apocalypse&quot; by a fire department lieutenant. Approximately 14,000 people were evacuated that evening, more than 2,400 structures were damaged or destroyed, and damages totaled more than $500 million. Fourteen people died in the fires, including local citizens and visiting tourists.

Following the fires, the town of Gatlinburg was shut down and considered a crime scene. The city reopened to residents only after a few days but maintained a strict curfew for more than a week, only reopening to the public after the curfew was lifted. In June 2017, the Sevier County district attorney dropped charges against two juveniles accused of starting the fire due to an inability to prove their actions led to the devastation that occurred in Gatlinburg five days later.

In May 2018, two Gatlinburg residents filed a $14.8 million lawsuit against the federal government for personal losses suffered in the fire.

==History==

===Early history===

The name &quot;Pigeon Forge&quot; comes from an iron forge built by Isaac Love (1783–1854) some time around 1820. The name of this forge referred to its location along the Little Pigeon River, in the vicinity of what is now the Old Mill. The name of the river comes from the flocks of passenger pigeons that frequented its banks at the time of the first Euro-American settlers&#x27; arrival.
For centuries, the Cherokee used the valley where Pigeon Forge is now located as a hunting ground. A Cherokee footpath known as &quot;Indian Gap Trail&quot; crossed the Great Smokies from North Carolina and passed through the Pigeon Forge valley en route to its junction with Great Indian Warpath in modern Sevierville. (US-441 closely parallels this ancient trail, although it crests the mountains at Newfound Gap rather than Indian Gap). From Sevierville, Great Indian Warpath headed west toward the Overhill Cherokee towns along the Little Tennessee River.

===18th century===
Indian Gap Trail brought the first Europeans to the Pigeon Forge area in the early 18th century. Along with hunters and trappers from North Carolina, traders from Virginia passed through the valley before 1750. Some time after 1783, Colonel Samuel Wear became one of the first permanent white settlers in the Pigeon Forge area. A veteran of the American Revolution, Wear erected a stockade near the confluence of Walden Creek and Little Pigeon River (now Pigeon Forge City Park) in 1792. This &quot;fort&quot; provided a safe stopover for early pioneers in the Sevier County area. Wear later served as a member of the committee that drafted Tennessee&#x27;s state constitution.

In 1785, Cherokee signed the Treaty of Dumplin Creek, ceding much of what is now Sevier County to the United States. Among the first to take advantage of this was Robert Shields (1740–1802), who received a survey for a tract of land in the Pigeon Forge area from the Watauga Land Office in 1786. Shields, who was also a veteran of the Revolution, established a small fort along Middle Creek near what is now Dollywood. Shields&#x27; son later wrote that the fort was long and wide, with walls constructed with &quot;heavy logs.&quot; The fort contained living quarters for six families, with a common kitchen at one end and a common living room at the other. As his family grew, Shields constructed separate houses for his children, one of which was purchased by Horatio Butler in 1797 and remained with his descendants until it was torn down in 1994.

Although the Shields Fort was too far from the main Cherokee trails to ever experience a serious assault, the Wear Fort straddled Indian Gap Trail, making it a target for small bands of Cherokee warriors. After the Cherokee attacked his fort in 1793, a frustrated Wear led a band of 60 frontiersmen across the northwestern Smokies into the Overhill Cherokee region, where they attacked and destroyed the town of Tallassee (near modern-day Calderwood Dam), killing at least 15 Cherokees and capturing several others. In 1794, the Cherokee fired on Wear and his two sons just outside Calvin&#x27;s Blockhouse (near Maryville), but they both escaped unharmed.

Although treaties negotiated at Tellico Blockhouse in 1794 and 1798 brought calm to the region, sporadic fighting between Cherokees and the settlers continued. One notable incident occurred in 1802, when Tavenor Runyan (1787–1802), the son of Isaac Barefoot Runyan (1749–1845) and Margaret Rambo (who had settled near the heart of modern Pigeon Forge), was killed by a Cherokee warrior. The recently elected Governor Archibald Roane was forced to personally intervene to prevent retaliatory strikes.

===19th century===
Like many Appalachian communities, religion played a major role in the early history of Pigeon Forge. In the early 19th century, circuit riders preached in the valley, creating a large Methodist following that remains to the present day. On October 20, 1808, Bishop Francis Asbury delivered a sermon at what is now Shiloh Memorial Cemetery in the northern half of Pigeon Forge, where a crude log church was erected. The first &quot;tourists&quot; to visit Pigeon Forge came for the extended revivals that were held in the Middle Creek area on the grounds of what is now Middle Creek Methodist Church as early as 1822. These revivals could last for weeks at a time.

In 1810, Revolutionary War veteran Mordecai Lewis obtained a land grant along the Little Pigeon River near the heart of what is now Pigeon Forge. In 1817, Lewis&#x27; son-in-law, Isaac Love (1783−1854), established the iron forge for which the city was eventually named. The complex included a bloomery furnace and water-powered trip hammer to smelt and mold ore into iron bars. Love erected the Pigeon Forge Mill in 1830, and on May 29, 1841, Love&#x27;s son, William, established a post office – which he named &quot;Pigeon Forge&quot; – for the mill and the small community that had developed in its vicinity. Local businessman John Sevier Trotter (1807−1884) purchased the mill and furnace in 1849 and subsequently made numerous modifications, including the addition of a sawmill. Although the iron furnace was sold and relocated in the 1880s, the Pigeon Forge Mill – usually called &quot;Old Mill&quot; – still stands and has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In the 1870s, a health resort was established in Pigeon Forge at Henderson Springs, adjacent to the Fort Wear site on the town&#x27;s north side. It was common during this period for the residents of large urban areas to visit mountain springs, the waters of which were believed to have health-restoring qualities.

===20th century===
In the early 20th century, Pigeon Forge was an isolated mountain hamlet with no major roads. The nearest railroad station was in Sevierville. Bridges were also rare, with the only major water crossings being a string of fords along the Little Pigeon.

When Great Smoky Mountains National Park opened in 1934, the Tennessee Valley Authority reported no tourism-oriented businesses in Pigeon Forge. By the 1950s, improvements to US-441 led to the establishment of a few campgrounds and lodges, but they did not generate major revenue. During this period, however, two factors in nearby Gatlinburg led to the eventual commercial boom Pigeon Forge experienced in the latter half of the 20th century. First, surrounded by high mountain ridges, Gatlinburg had limited land resources. Second, its land resources were largely controlled by a few local families who thwarted attempts by outside businesses to take advantage of the town&#x27;s prime location. Thus, outside entrepreneurs were forced to look elsewhere. Pigeon Forge, located just north of Gatlinburg along US-441, became a target.

In 1961, shortly after Pigeon Forge officially incorporated, North Carolina brothers Grover and Harry Robbins opened Rebel Railroad in the town&#x27;s Middle Creek area. The railroad simulated a ride on a Confederate steam train that was under attack by Union soldiers during the Civil War, playing upon the centennial anniversary of the war. After the Union assault was beaten back, the railroad came to a stop at a mock frontier mountain town, complete with blacksmith shop, general store, and saloon. By 1964, interest in the Civil War Centennial was beginning to die down, so the Robbins brothers decided to rename the railroad Goldrush Junction. The attraction was reworked with a &quot;Wild West&quot; theme replacing the Civil War theme, in a similar fashion to the Robbins&#x27; other tourist train ride in North Carolina, Tweetsie Railroad. Goldrush Junction was much more successful than Rebel Railroad, prompting the Robbinses to buy a log flume amusement ride and erect it on the property in 1967. According to a park tourist brochure from the time, the ride was &quot;brought to Goldrush Junction from the New York World&#x27;s Fair, where it was one of the most successful attractions.&quot;

In 1969, after Pigeon Forge issued a zoning plan assigning the entire strip along US-441 for tourism use, Art Modell (owner of the Cleveland Browns) purchased Goldrush Junction. In 1976, Modell sold it to the Herschend Brothers of Branson, Missouri. The Herschends renamed the park Silver Dollar City after their successful theme park in Branson. The Ozark mountain theme of the Branson location was easily reapplied as an Appalachian theme in Pigeon Forge, and the park&#x27;s attendance began to climb.

In 1982, hoping to capitalize on the publicity generated by the Knoxville World&#x27;s Fair, Pigeon Forge initiated an aggressive economic plan that centered around theme parks, outlet malls, and live music venues. The first outlet mall, Factory Merchants, opened that same year. By 1987, there were four outlet malls in Pigeon Forge, and by the early 1990s, outlet malls provided 44% of the town&#x27;s gross revenue.

The increasing number of tourist attractions brought competition for Silver Dollar City and its chief competitor in Pigeon Forge, Magic World, which had constructed a theme park on the slopes of Pine Mountain in the city&#x27;s south section. In 1985, the Herschends approached entertainer Dolly Parton (who was born in nearby Sevierville) with a proposal for a partnership in the promotion and operation of Silver Dollar City. After lengthy negotiations, Parton became a majority partner in the enterprise, and Silver Dollar City was renamed Dollywood to launch a major marketing campaign. Magic World folded in 1994.

===21st century===

Although the commercial boom in Pigeon Forge vastly increased the town&#x27;s revenue, it had several undesirable effects. As land value increased, many farmers could no longer afford the accompanying high property taxes and were forced to sell their land. The high cost of living in Pigeon Forge is difficult to offset with the low wage jobs that often accompany the tourist industry.

Dollywood continued expansion into the 21st century, adding a separate water park in 2001.

In 2016, the area was affected by the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires.

=== Registered historic sites ===
* Pigeon Forge Mill: Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, this working gristmill, also known as Old Mill, is on the West Fork of the Little Pigeon River (along its east bank), and is accessible via Old Mill Drive (which intersects the Parkway at Light #7).

<text>Pittman Center is a town in Sevier County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 454 at the 2020 census and 502 at the 2010 census. The town borders Gatlinburg and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. U.S. 321 passes through the town.

Emert&#x27;s Cove is situated in Pittman Center, a broad valley along the Middle Fork of the Little Pigeon River. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park borders Pittman Center to the south, and the town&#x27;s history and economy are largely intertwined with that of the Smokies.

It is also the birthplace of American country music singer Dolly Parton.

==History==
Like much of Sevier County, Emert&#x27;s Cove was a Cherokee hunting ground before the colonization of the area. After the Battle of Boyds Creek and several violent incidents between the Cherokee and the settlers to the west in what is now Cocke County, the Cherokee were induced to sign the Treaty of Dumplin Creek in 1785, ceding what is now Sevier County to the State of Franklin. Among the first Euro-American settlers to move into the newly gained territory was Frederick Emert (1754–1829), who arrived with his family sometime between 1785 and 1793.

Emert was born in Pennsylvania to German immigrants. He fought in the American Revolution for the Continental Army, and probably saw action at the Battle of Brandywine Creek. In 2000, the residents of Pittman Center erected the Emert&#x27;s Cove Covered Bridge in his honor.

Other settlers arrived in Emert&#x27;s Cove with Emert in 1785. Among them was Johan Martin Shultz (1740–1787), a Revolutionary War surgeon that had served alongside Emert and John Sevier in the &quot;Overmountain Men&quot; in the Battle of King&#x27;s Mountain. Shultz&#x27;s son, Martin S.E. Shultz, would go on to marry Emert&#x27;s daughter, Barbara Ann.

Another important settler was Daniel Wesley Reagan (1803–1892), whose parents and grandparents were among the first settlers in what is now Gatlinburg. Many residents of Pittman Center are descended from these early settlers.

===The Pittman Community Center===
In 1910, a survey of Tennessee found Sevier County to be most in need of educational facilities. In spite of the establishment of a settlement school in Gatlinburg by the Pi Beta Phi fraternity in 1912, education in the region was still appallingly lacking. To help remedy this situation, Dr. John Burnett, a Methodist minister who visited the Smokies in 1919, envisioned the establishment a large-scale school in the area that would operate with virtually no tuition rates. Later that year, the Methodist Episcopal Church endorsed Burnett&#x27;s plan at its annual meeting, and with the help of Reverend Eli Pittman of Elmira, New York, Burnett secured $15,000 for the project. In 1920, Burnett purchased Garfield Scott&#x27;s farm just above the confluence of Webb Creek and the Middle Fork of the Little Pigeon River. This plot of land would become the core of the new school&#x27;s campus.

In late 1920, Burnett&#x27;s new settlement school, which he named &quot;Pittman Community Center&quot; in honor of Reverend Pittman, opened with an enrollment of 100. The school eventually expanded to include , 15 buildings, and 240 students operating on an annual budget of $9,000. The buildings included a general store, post office, and a small hospital. The Pittman School supported itself by canning tomatoes and growing apples, with students doing all the maintenance work.

In 1955, the Sevier County Board of Education purchased the Pittman School, and the school was combined with the Pi Beta Phi High School in Gatlinburg to form Gatlinburg-Pittman High School in 1963. The only building remaining from the Pittman school is the Home Economics building, which the Methodist Episcopal Church gave to the town after its incorporation for use as its city hall. In 1996, the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Municipal incorporation===
In 1974 the community incorporated as the town of Pittman Center, which includes both the former Pittman Community Center campus and Emert&#x27;s Cove.

The Town of Pittman Center provides police services with a police department consisting of a Chief of Police and three full time patrol officers.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

Pittman Center spans most of Emert&#x27;s Cove, which is located just north of the Greenbrier section of the Smokies. The cove cuts into Webb Mountain, a low ridge that runs roughly parallel to the national park boundary. The main section of Pittman Center, which includes its city hall and maintenance buildings, an elementary school, and Burnett Memorial Chapel, is situated just above the confluence of Webb Creek and the Middle Fork of the Little Pigeon at the northern tip of the cove.

Tennessee Route 416, which connects U.S. Route 321 at the park border with U.S. Route 411 in Sevierville, is Pittman Center&#x27;s main road. Pittman Center&#x27;s road signs are distinguished by gold lettering on an olive green background.

<text>Sevierville ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Sevier County, Tennessee, United States, located in eastern Tennessee. The population was 17,889 at the 2020 United States Census.

==History==
Native Americans of the Woodland period were among the first human inhabitants of what is now Sevierville. They arrived circa 200 A.D.

Between 1200 and 1500 A.D., during the Dallas phase of the Mississippian period, a group of Native Americans established McMahan Mound Site, a relatively large village centered on a platform mound and surrounded by a palisade just above the confluence of the West Fork and the Little Pigeon River. This mound was approximately high and across. An excavation in 1881 unearthed burial sites, arrowheads, a marble pipe, glass beads, pottery, and engraved objects. At the time of this first excavation, the mound was located on a farm owned by the McMahan family, and was thus given the name &quot;McMahan Indian Mound.&quot;

By the early 18th century, the Cherokee controlled much of the Tennessee side of the Smokies and had established a series of settlements along the Little Tennessee River. A section of the Great Indian Warpath forked at the mouth of Boyd&#x27;s Creek, just north of Sevierville. The main branch crossed the French Broad and continued along Dumplin Creek to the Nolichucky basin in northeastern Tennessee. The other branch, known as the Tuckaleechee and Southeastern Trail, turned south along the West Fork of the Little Pigeon River. This second branch forked again at modern-day Pigeon Forge, with the main trail turning east en route to Little River and the other branch, known as Indian Gap Trail, crossing the crest of the Smokies to the south and descending into the Oconaluftee area of North Carolina. The various Cherokee trails crossing Sevier County brought the first Euro-American traders and settlers to the area.

===Early Euro-American settlement===
European long hunters and traders arrived in the Sevierville area in the mid-18th century. Isaac Thomas (c. 1735–1818), the most notable of these early traders, was well respected by the Cherokee and may have lived at the Overhill town of Chota at one time. Europeans like Thomas were mainly in the area in search of animal furs, which they exchanged for manufactured goods.

As settlers began to trickle into East Tennessee, relations with the Cherokee began to turn hostile. During the Revolutionary War, the Cherokee, who had aligned themselves with the British, launched sporadic attacks against the sparse settlements in the Tennessee Valley. In December 1780, Col. John Sevier, fresh off a victory against the British at King&#x27;s Mountain, launched a punitive expedition against the Cherokee. Sevier defeated the Cherokee at the Battle of Boyd&#x27;s Creek and proceeded to destroy several Cherokee settlements along the Little Tennessee.

A temporary truce secured by James White in 1783 led to an influx of Euro-American settlers in the French Broad valley. Hugh Henry (1756–1838) erected a small fort near the mouth of Dumplin Creek in 1782 known as Henry&#x27;s Station. He was joined the following year by Samuel Newell (1754–1841), who established Newell&#x27;s Station along Boyd&#x27;s Creek, and Joshua Gist, who settled near the creek&#x27;s mouth. Other early forts in the area included Willson&#x27;s Station at the confluence of the East and Middle Fork of the Little Pigeon and Wear&#x27;s Fort at the junction of the Southeastern and Tuckaleechee Trail and Indian Gap Trail. The Cherokee signed away all rights to what is now Sevier County in the 1785 Treaty of Dumplin Creek, which was negotiated at Henry&#x27;s Station.

In 1783, Isaac Thomas established a farm, trading post, and tavern at the confluence of the West Fork and the Little Pigeon River. He was joined shortly thereafter by Spencer Clack (1740–1832) and James McMahan, and a community known as &quot;Forks of the Little Pigeon&quot; developed around them. In 1789, Reverend Richard Wood (1756–1831) established Forks-of-the-River Baptist Church, which reported a congregation of 22 in 1790. By 1795, the congregation had 94 members.

===Antebellum Sevierville===

Sevier County was created in 1794 and named after John Sevier. At a meeting at Thomas&#x27; house the following year, the Forks-of-the-Little-Pigeon area was chosen as the county seat and renamed &quot;Sevierville.&quot; James McMahan donated a tract of land for erecting a town square. This tract was parceled out into lots of that purchasers were required to build brick, framed, or stone structures on.

The first Sevier County Courthouse was built in 1796. According to local legend, court was held in a flea-infested abandoned stable before its construction. The lore suggests that irritated lawyers paid an unknown person a bottle of whiskey to burn down the stable, forcing the new county to build an actual courthouse.

As the county grew, several large farms were established in the fertile Boyd&#x27;s Creek area. In 1792, Andrew Evans purchased a tract of land near the mouth of Boyd&#x27;s Creek and built a ferry near the site of the old ford. In 1798, he sold the farm to John Brabson, and it became known as Brabson&#x27;s Ferry Plantation. In the early 1790s, Thomas Buckingham established a large farm between Boyd&#x27;s Creek and Sevierville. He went on to become the county&#x27;s first sheriff. In the early 19th century, Timothy Chandler and his son, John Chandler (1786–1875), established the Wheatlands plantation in Boyd&#x27;s Creek.

As towns situated along the French Broad are connected via waterway to New Orleans, flatboat trade flourished along the river in the early 19th century. In 1793, James Hubbert, who lived along Dumplin Creek, established Hubbert&#x27;s Flat Landing to trade with flatboats moving up and down the river.

In the early 19th century, Knoxville and Asheville were connected via Route 17, a crude road that followed the banks of the French Broad. This new road gave Tennessee&#x27;s cattle drovers greater access to markets along the east coast. In 1820, a stagecoach road connected Sevierville with Maryville to the west. Sevierville&#x27;s status as a county seat along these early roads helped it grow. By 1833, the town had a population of 150, including two doctors, two carpenters, a tanner, two tailors, a shoemaker, three stores, a hatter, two taverns, and two mills. Distilleries were popular means of supplemental income. By 1850, John Chandler&#x27;s distillery was producing 6,000 gallons of whiskey per year.

A notable late arrival in Sevierville was Dr. Robert H. Hodsden (1806–1864), who was an attending physician for the Trail of Tears. In 1846, Hodsden began construction on a plantation near Fair Garden, just outside Sevierville to the east. Known as Rose Glen, this plantation was worth $28,000 in 1860, making it one of the most valuable in the county.

In 1856, a fire swept through Sevierville, burning a recently constructed courthouse, 41 houses, and several shops in the downtown area. The county lost nearly all of the vital records of its early settlers.

===The Civil War===

Slavery was not common in Sevier County, although it did occur, especially at the large plantations along the French Broad River. Even before the American Civil War, Sevierville – a hotbed of abolitionist activity – was home to a relatively large community of free African-Americans. In 1861, only 3.8% of the residents of Sevier County voted in favor of secession from the Union.

In late 1861, a pro-secession speech delivered by Henry Foote sparked an angry response in Sevierville and was followed by a series of explosive anti-secession speeches. The following year, pro-Union Knoxville newspaper editor Parson Brownlow gave a rousing anti-secession speech in Sevierville en route to a hideout in Wears Valley. Brownlow&#x27;s audience remained gathered throughout the night after a rumor spread that Confederate forces were approaching. Union supporters in Sevier County were harassed and threatened throughout the war, even after Union forces under Ambrose Burnside occupied Knoxville in September 1863.

Sevierville, situated at a major crossroads south of Knoxville, suffered consistent harassment, looting, and confiscation of property by both Union and Confederate forces moving through the town in 1863 and 1864. Vance Newman, a Union recruiting officer living in Sevierville at the time, later recalled:

A guard of rebel soldiers in 1864 threatened to burn my house, and the rebel soldiers so often threatened to take my life that I cannot particularize. They were always after me because of my Union sentiments.

After Confederate General James Longstreet failed to retake Knoxville in the Battle of Fort Sanders, Union and Confederate forces quickly initiated a series of maneuvers to gain control of the strategic fords along the French Broad, culminating in an engagement near Hodsden&#x27;s farm at Fair Garden in January 1864. Although the Union forces were victorious, they were later forced to retreat due to lack of supplies. A state of general anarchy ensued that continued until the end of the war. On October 30, 1864, Sevierville resident Terressa McCown wrote in her diary:

The robbers have come at last, they robbed my husband of his pocketbook, money and papers and pocket knife. Times get worse everyday. We know not what will come next. I feel this morning like nothing but destruction awaits us.

At the war&#x27;s end, most of the county&#x27;s few remaining Confederate sympathizers, most notably members of the Brabson family, were forced to flee.

===Postwar-present===
Sevierville recovered quickly from the war, with a number of new houses and businesses being built in the 1870s. Two members of the town&#x27;s African-American community — house builder Lewis Buckner (1856–1924) and brickmason Isaac Dockery (1832–1910) — played a prominent role in Sevierville&#x27;s post-war construction boom. Buckner designed a number of houses in the Sevierville area over a 40-year period, 15 of which are still standing. Dockery&#x27;s contributions include the New Salem Baptist Church in 1886 and the Sevier County Courthouse in 1896, both of which are still standing.

By the 1880s, Sevierville was growing rapidly, as was the population of Sevier County. In 1887, the town had four general stores, two groceries, a jeweler, a sawmill, and two hotels. It was also home to the Sevierville Lumber Company, which was established to harvest trees in the area. Tourists also started to trickle into Sevier County, drawn by the reported health-restoring qualities of mountain springs. Resorts sprang up throughout the county, with Seaton Springs and Henderson Springs located just south of Sevierville.

In 1892, a vigilante group known as the &quot;Whitecaps&quot; was formed to rid Sevier County of vice. The group wore white hoods to conceal their identities and used Ku Klux Klan-like tactics, although they were not considered a racist entity. The Whitecaps initially threatened women accused of prostitution, and the group began launching nightly attacks in the mid-1890s. In 1893, Sevierville physician J.A. Henderson took over an anti-Whitecap group, which he renamed the &quot;Blue Bills.&quot; The two vigilante groups clashed at Henderson Springs in 1894, with deaths occurring on both sides. In 1896, the Whitecaps&#x27; murder of a young Sevierville couple led to widespread outrage, and in 1898, the Tennessee State Legislature banned &quot;extra-legal conspiracies&quot; and vigilante groups. Due to this measure and the efforts of Sevier County Deputy Sheriff Thomas Davis, the Whitecaps largely vanished by the end of the century.

After a fire destroyed much of the downtown area in 1900, businesses shifted from the old town square at Main Street to the new Sevierville Commercial District, viz. Court Avenue and Bruce Street, which centered on the new courthouse. The town incorporated in 1901.

In 1910, Indiana entrepreneur William J. Oliver finished work on the Knoxville, Sevierville and Eastern Railroad, which was Sevier County&#x27;s first standard gauge rail line. Known as the Smoky Mountain Railroad, this line offered passenger service between Knoxville and Sevierville until 1962.

With the opening of Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 1934, tens of thousands of tourists began passing through Sevierville, which was situated about halfway between the park and Knoxville. U.S. 441, initially known as Smoky Mountain Highway, was completed to Sevierville in 1934 and later extended to North Carolina.

Entertainer Dolly Parton was born in Sevierville in 1946. Her Parton ancestors had migrated to Greenbrier sometime around 1850 and later moved to Locust Ridge (near Pittman Center), where Parton was born, after the establishment of the national park. In more recent years, the town erected a statue of Parton on the lawn of the courthouse and named Dolly Parton Parkway after her.

Much of Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s 1973 novel &quot;Child of God&quot; takes place in Sevierville and the surrounding area.

== Geography ==

Sevierville is located along the Little Pigeon River which is formed by the confluence of its East Fork and Middle Fork, both of which flow down from their sources high in the Great Smoky Mountains. Five miles (8 km) downstream to the west, the Little Pigeon absorbs its West Fork before turning north and flowing for another five miles (8 km) to its mouth along the French Broad River. Sevierville is centered on the stretch of land between these two junctions of the East and Middle Fork and the West Fork, known traditionally as Forks-of-the-Pigeon or Forks-of-the-River.

Situated in an area where the Foothills of the Great Smokies give way to the Tennessee Valley, Sevierville has long acted as a nexus between Knoxville to the north and the Appalachian towns in the mountains to the south. Great Smoky Mountains National Park is located approximately ten miles south of Sevierville.

Due to its hilly terrain and the relatively poor roads of 19th-century Sevier County, a number of smaller communities developed independently along the outskirts of Sevierville. These include Harrisburg and Fair Garden to the east and Catlettsburg and Boyd&#x27;s Creek to the north. In addition, the United States Postal Service associates the name &quot;Sevierville&quot; with ZIP codes for much of Sevier County, including some of the town of Pittman Center and other geographically extensive areas located outside Sevierville&#x27;s city limits.

Several major state and federal highways intersect in Sevierville. U.S. Route 441, commonly called &quot;The Parkway,&quot; connects Sevierville with Knoxville to the north and the national park and Cherokee, North Carolina, to the south. The Sevierville section of U.S. 441 has been named &quot;Forks-of-the-River Parkway.&quot; State Route 66, also called Winfield Dunn Parkway, connects Sevierville with Interstate 40 to the north. U.S. Route 411 traverses Sevierville from east to west, connecting Sevierville with Blount and Cocke counties. State Route 416 connects Sevierville with Pittman Center and U.S. Route 321 at the park boundary to the southeast.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.45%) is water.

<doc id="135361" wikidata="Q2508961" url="?curid=135361" title="Arlington, Tennessee">
<text>Arlington is a town in the U.S. state of Tennessee. It is one of the seven municipalities in Shelby County. The town was officially incorporated as Haysville in 1878 and again as Arlington in 1900. The population was 2,569 at the 2000 census, 11,517 at the 2010 census, and 14,549 at the 2020 Census. From 2010 until 2020 the town&#x27;s population grew by 26.33%.

== Government ==
According to the town&#x27;s official website, Arlington follows a general law Mayor-Aldermanic charter and is governed by the Board of Mayor and Aldermen (BMA), the members of which are elected to 4-year terms. The current mayor is Mike Wissman, who was originally elected in September 2011 and is serving his 4th term. The current Vice Mayor is Harry McKee. Arlington has six alderman: Larry Harmon, Dwight Barker, Jeff McKee, Oscar Brooks, Harry McKee, and Jeremy Biggs.

Within the Arlington government, there are 9 recognized boards and committees: Board of Zoning Appeals, Design Review Committee, Finance Committee, Health &amp; Safety Committee, Industrial Development Board, Library Board, Parks and Recreation Committee, Planning Commission, and the Board of Education (Arlington Community Schools).

== History ==

=== Early Settlement and Founding ===
The area now known as Arlington, Tennessee, was originally inhabited by the Chickasaw Nation. Following the Treaty of Tuscaloosa, this territory, along with other parts of West Tennessee, was ceded to the United States. On November 24, 1819, Shelby County was established, named in honor of Isaac Shelby, a commissioner involved in the treaty negotiations, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War, and the first governor of Kentucky. By the 1830s, the nascent community comprised fewer than 20 settlers.

=== Establishment of Withe Depot and Economic Growth ===
By 1856, the population had increased to approximately 200 residents. Agriculture, particularly cotton farming, was the dominant economic activity, necessitating reliable transportation for shipping goods. In response, Withe Depot was constructed on land donated by General Samuel J. Hays, a nephew of President Andrew Jackson, strategically served by the Memphis, Clarksville and Louisville Railroad. The depot became a critical shipping point, primarily for cotton, to support the agricultural economy of the region. In recognition of General Hays’s substantial land donation, the community was subsequently named Haysville.

The railroad infrastructure significantly shaped Haysville&#x27;s development and connectivity. A local train, colloquially referred to as &quot;The Accommodation,&quot; became a vital link for residents commuting to Memphis for work and school. Anecdotes from the period suggest that the train’s crew, including the engineer, flagman, and conductor, were familiar with the daily passengers, occasionally slowing the train to accommodate late arrivals running from their homes to board.

=== Impact of the Civil War and Subsequent Recovery ===
The onset of the American Civil War brought considerable disruption to Haysville. Many local men enlisted to fight in the conflict, and a significant number did not return, affecting the town&#x27;s population and growth trajectory. In 1872, following the war, land owned by the estate of General Hays was subdivided and sold at public auction. Streets in the new layout were named to honor notable figures such as Bishop Charles Quintard, President Andrew Jackson, Colonel Robert I. Chester, and General Nathan Bedford Forrest. The first residential structure was constructed by Captain Henry Munger Pitman, who served as the depot agent.

=== Incorporation and Public Health Measures ===
Haysville was formally incorporated on February 10, 1878, with W.B. Nolley elected as its first mayor. During this period, an outbreak of yellow fever prompted local authorities to enforce a quarantine, restricting entry to the town in an effort to prevent the spread of the epidemic. The town’s early leaders, including subsequent mayors H.Y. Marley, Dr. J.P. Bone, W.I. Hooks, and C.C. Poole, were instrumental in guiding the community through this public health crisis.

=== Renaming to Arlington and Late 19th-Century Expansion ===
In 1883, the need for a local post office led town officials to discover that a &quot;Haysville&quot; post office already existed within the state. Captain Henry Pitman suggested renaming the town &quot;Arlington,&quot; inspired by Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. The inaugural school in the town, Memphis District High School, was established in January 1884 by the Memphis Conference of Methodist Church. It was situated on the site that is presently known as Hughes-College Hill Park. By this time, the population had reached 500 residents, and the town’s economy had diversified to include a steam sawmill, gristmill, steam cotton gin, livery stable, general stores, and four churches. By the close of the 19th century, Arlington had expanded its infrastructure to include a dedicated post office, a physician’s practice, a druggist, a lumber store, a meat market, and an undertaker&#x27;s establishment.

Arlington was re-incorporated in December 1900 with a population of around 600. Early mayors included notable figures such as Will Taylor, Charles McAuley, C.W. Bond, Sam Tucker Wilson, and Jimmy Henry, who played key roles in the town&#x27;s governance and development.

=== Preservation of Historical Landmarks ===
Arlington has made a concerted effort to preserve its historical heritage. Prominent landmarks include the Rachel H.K. Burrows Museum, the S.Y. Wilson &amp; Company building, the Blacksmith Shop, and the Historic Post Office. Additionally, a replica of the original 19th-century railroad depot was constructed in 2003, now serving as the Arlington Senior Citizens Center. Several historic residential structures remain intact, showcasing the architectural styles of the period.

<text>Bartlett is a city in Shelby County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 57,786 at the 2020 U.S. Census.

==History==
Bartlett, originally called &quot;Union Depot&quot;, first served as the last major Tennessean depot along the westward stagecoach route from Nashville. It later shifted to serve as a rail station after the stagecoach route was replaced by the Memphis &amp; Ohio Railroad. An agricultural community gradually emerged around the depot and subsequent station that saw little growth until after the American Civil War.

The community saw quick growth during Reconstruction, and by 1886 was home to a school, two gristmills, three churches, several general stores, and about 300 inhabitants. It had been officially incorporated on November 1, 1866, with a population of less than 100 under the inaugural mayorship of Bryan Wither. The city derived its name from Major Gabriel M. Bartlett, a planter and pioneer settler of the area, whose homeplace was located on the old Raleigh-Somerville Road (Stage Road) at the present location of Bartlett Station Plaza.
