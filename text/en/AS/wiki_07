<text>A gift economy or gift culture is a system of exchange where valuables are not sold, but rather given without an explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards. Social norms and customs govern giving a gift in a gift culture; although there is some expectation of reciprocity, gifts are not given in an explicit exchange of goods or services for money, or some other good or service. This contrasts with a barter economy or a market economy, where goods and services are primarily explicitly exchanged for value received.

The nature of gift economies is the subject of a foundational debate in anthropology. Anthropological research into gift economies began with Bronisław Malinowski&#x27;s description of the Kula ring in the Trobriand Islands during World War I. The Kula trade appeared to be gift-like since Trobrianders would travel great distances over dangerous seas to give what were considered valuable objects without any guarantee of a return. Malinowski&#x27;s debate with the French anthropologist Marcel Mauss quickly established the complexity of &quot;gift exchange&quot; and introduced a series of technical terms such as reciprocity, inalienable possessions, and presentation to distinguish between the different forms of exchange.

According to anthropologists Maurice Bloch and Jonathan Parry, it is the unsettled relationship between market and non-market exchange that attracts the most attention. Some authors argue that gift economies build community, while markets harm community relationships.

Gift exchange is distinguished from other forms of exchange by a number of principles, such as the form of property rights governing the articles exchanged; whether gifting forms a distinct &quot;sphere of exchange&quot; that can be characterized as an &quot;economic system&quot;; and the character of the social relationship that the gift exchange establishes. Gift ideology in highly commercialized societies differs from the &quot;prestations&quot; typical of non-market societies. Gift economies also differ from related phenomena, such as common property regimes and the exchange of non-commodified labour.

== Principles of gift exchange ==
According to anthropologist Jonathan Parry, discussion on the nature of gifts, and of a separate sphere of gift exchange that would constitute an economic system, has been plagued by the ethnocentric use of a modern, western, market society-based conception of the gift applied as if it were a universal across culture and time. However, he argues that anthropologists, through analysis of a variety of cultural and historical forms of exchange, have established that no universal practice exists. Similarly, the idea of a &quot;pure gift&quot; is &quot;most likely to arise in highly differentiated societies with an advanced division of labour and a significant commercial sector&quot; and need to be distinguished from non-market &quot;prestations&quot;. According to Weiner, to speak of a gift economy in a non-market society is to ignore the distinctive features of their exchange relationships, as the early classic debate between Bronislaw Malinowski and Marcel Mauss demonstrated. Gift exchange is frequently &quot;embedded&quot; in political, kin, or religious institutions, and therefore does not constitute an &quot;economic&quot; system per se.

===Property and alienability===
Gift-giving is a form of transfer of property rights over particular objects. The nature of those property rights varies from society to society, from culture to culture. They are not universal. The nature of gift-giving is thus altered by the type of property regime in place.

Property is not a thing, but a relationship amongst people about things. It is a social relationship that governs the conduct of people with respect to the use and disposition of things. Anthropologists analyze these relationships in terms of a variety of actors&#x27; (individual or corporate) bundle of rights over objects. An example is the current debates around intellectual property rights. Take a purchased book over which the author retains a copyright. Although the book is a commodity, bought and sold, it has not been completely alienated from its creator, who maintains a hold over it; the owner of the book is limited in what he can do with the book by the rights of the creator. Weiner has argued that the ability to give while retaining a right to the gift/commodity is a critical feature of the gifting cultures described by Malinowski and Mauss, and explains, for example, why some gifts such as Kula valuables return to their original owners after an incredible journey around the Trobriand islands. The gifts given in Kula exchange still remain, in some respects, the property of the giver.

In the example used above, copyright is one of those bundled rights that regulate the use and disposition of a book. Gift-giving in many societies is complicated because private property owned by an individual may be quite limited in scope (see below). Productive resources, such as land, may be held by members of a corporate group (such as a lineage), but only some members of that group may have use rights. When many people hold rights over the same objects, gifting has very different implications than the gifting of private property; only some of the rights in that object may be transferred, leaving that object still tied to its corporate owners. As such, these types of objects are inalienable possessions, simultaneously kept while given.

===Gift versus prestation===

Malinowski&#x27;s study of the Kula ring became the subject of debate with the French anthropologist, Marcel Mauss, author of &quot;The Gift&quot; (&quot;Essai sur le don&quot;, 1925). Parry argued that Malinowski emphasized the exchange of goods between &quot;individuals&quot;, and their selfish motives for gifting: they expected a return of equal or greater value. Malinowski argued that reciprocity is an implicit part of gifting, that there is no gift free of expectation.

In contrast, Mauss emphasized that the gifts were not between individuals, but between representatives of larger collectives. These gifts were a &quot;total prestation,&quot; a service provided out of obligation, like community service. They were not alienable commodities to be bought and sold, but, like crown jewels, embodied the reputation, history and identity of a &quot;corporate kin group&quot;, such as a line of kings. Given the stakes, Mauss asked &quot;why anyone would give them away?&quot; His answer was an enigmatic concept, &quot;the spirit of the gift.&quot; Parry believes that much of the confusion (and resulting debate) was due to a bad translation. Mauss appeared to be arguing that a return gift is given to maintain the relationship between givers; a failure to return a gift ends the relationship and the promise of any future gifts.

Both Malinowski and Mauss agreed that in non-market societies, where there was no clear institutionalized economic exchange system, gift/prestation exchange served economic, kinship, religious and political functions that could not be clearly distinguished from each other, and which mutually influenced the nature of the practice.

===Inalienable possessions===

The concept of total prestations was further developed by Annette Weiner, who revisited Malinowski&#x27;s fieldsite in the Trobriand Islands. Her critique was twofold. First, Trobriand Island society is matrilineal, and women hold much economic and political power, but their exchanges were ignored by Malinowski. Secondly, she developed Mauss&#x27; argument about reciprocity and the &quot;spirit of the gift&quot; in terms of &quot;inalienable possessions: the paradox of keeping while giving&quot;. Weiner contrasted moveable goods, which can be exchanged, with immoveable goods that serve to draw the gifts back (in the Trobriand case, male Kula gifts with women&#x27;s landed property). The goods given on the islands are so linked to particular groups that even when given away, they are not truly alienated. Such goods depend on the existence of particular kinds of kinship groups in society.

French anthropologist Maurice Godelier continued this analysis in &quot;The Enigma of the Gift&quot; (1999). Albert Schrauwers argued that the kinds of societies used as examples by Weiner and Godelier (including the Kula ring in the Trobriands, the Potlatch of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, and the Toraja of South Sulawesi, Indonesia) are all characterized by ranked aristocratic kin groups that fit Claude Lévi-Strauss&#x27; model of &quot;House Societies&quot; (where &quot;house&quot; refers to both noble lineage and their landed estate). Total prestations are given to preserve landed estates identified with particular kin groups and maintain their place in a ranked society.

===Reciprocity and the spirit of the gift===
Chris Gregory argued that reciprocity is a dyadic exchange relationship that we characterize, imprecisely, as gift-giving. Gregory argued that one gives gifts to friends and potential enemies in order to establish a relationship, by placing them in debt. He also claimed that in order for such a relationship to persist, there must be a time lag between the gift and counter-gift; one or the other partner must always be in debt. Marshall Sahlins gave birthday gifts as an example. They are separated in time so that one partner feels the obligation to make a return gift. To forget the return gift may be enough to end the relationship. Gregory stated that without a relationship of debt, there is no reciprocity, and that this is what distinguishes a gift economy from a &quot;true&quot; gift, given with no expectation of return (something Sahlins &quot;generalised reciprocity;&quot; see below).

Marshall Sahlins, an American cultural anthropologist, identified three main types of reciprocity in his book &quot;Stone Age Economics&quot; (1972). Gift or &quot;generalized reciprocity&quot; is the exchange of goods and services without keeping track of their exact value, but often with the expectation that their value will balance out over time. &quot;Balanced or Symmetrical reciprocity&quot; occurs when someone gives to someone else, expecting a fair and tangible return at a specified amount, time, and place. Market or &quot;negative reciprocity&quot; is the exchange of goods and services where each party intends to profit from the exchange, often at the expense of the other. Gift economies, or generalized reciprocity, occurred within closely knit kin groups, and the more distant the exchange partner, the more balanced or negative the exchange became.

===Charity, debt, and the &quot;poison of the gift&quot;===
Jonathan Parry argued that ideologies of the &quot;pure gift&quot; are most likely to arise only in highly differentiated societies with an advanced division of labour and a significant commercial sector&quot; and need to be distinguished from the non-market &quot;prestations&quot; discussed above. Parry also underscored, using the example of charitable giving of alms in India (Dāna), that the &quot;pure gift&quot; of alms given with no expectation of return could be &quot;poisonous&quot;. That is, the gift of alms embodying the sins of the giver, when given to ritually pure priests, saddled these priests with impurities of which they could not cleanse themselves. &quot;Pure gifts&quot;, given without a return, can place recipients in debt, and hence in dependent status: the poison of the gift. David Graeber points out that no reciprocity is expected between unequals: if you make a gift of a dollar to a beggar, he will not give it back the next time you meet. More than likely, he will ask for more, to the detriment of his status. Many who are forced by circumstances to accept charity feel stigmatized. In the Moka exchange system of Papua New Guinea, where gift givers become political &quot;big men&quot;, those who are in their debt and unable to repay with &quot;interest&quot; are referred to as &quot;rubbish men&quot;.

The French writer Georges Bataille, in &quot;La part Maudite&quot;, uses Mauss&#x27;s argument in order to construct a theory of economy: the structure of gift is the presupposition for all possible economy. Bataille is particularly interested in the potlatch as described by Mauss, and claims that its agonistic character obliges the receiver to confirm their own subjection. Thus gifting embodies the Hegelian dipole of master and slave within the act.

===Spheres of exchange and &quot;economic systems&quot;===

The relationship of new market exchange systems to indigenous non-market exchange remained a perplexing question for anthropologists. Paul Bohannan argued that the Tiv of Nigeria had three spheres of exchange, and that only certain kinds of goods could be exchanged in each sphere; each sphere had its own form of special-purpose money. However, the market and universal money allowed goods to be traded between spheres and thus damaged established social relationships. Jonathan Parry and Maurice Bloch argued in &quot;Money and the Morality of Exchange&quot; (1989), that the &quot;transactional order&quot; through which long-term social reproduction of the family occurs has to be preserved as separate from short-term market relations. It is the long-term social reproduction of the family that is sacralized by religious rituals such baptisms, weddings and funerals, and characterized by gifting.

In such situations where gift-giving and market exchange were intersecting for the first time, some anthropologists contrasted them as polar opposites. This opposition was classically expressed by Chris Gregory in his book &quot;Gifts and Commodities&quot; (1982). Gregory argued that:

Gregory contrasts gift and commodity exchange according to five criteria:

But other anthropologists refused to see these different &quot;exchange spheres&quot; as such polar opposites. Marilyn Strathern, writing on a similar area in Papua New Guinea, dismissed the utility of the contrasting setup in &quot;The Gender of the Gift&quot; (1988).

Rather than emphasize how particular kinds of objects are either gifts or commodities to be traded in restricted spheres of exchange, Arjun Appadurai and others began to look at how objects flowed between these spheres of exchange (i.e. how objects can be converted into gifts and then back into commodities). They refocussed attention away from the character of the human relationships formed through exchange, and placed it on &quot;the social life of things&quot; instead. They examined the strategies by which an object could be &quot;singularized&quot; (made unique, special, one-of-a-kind) and so withdrawn from the market. A marriage ceremony that transforms a purchased ring into an irreplaceable family heirloom is one example; the heirloom, in turn, makes a perfect gift. Singularization is the reverse of the seemingly irresistible process of commodification. They thus show how all economies are a constant flow of material objects that enter and leave specific exchange spheres. A similar approach is taken by Nicholas Thomas, who examines the same range of cultures and the anthropologists who write on them, and redirects attention to the &quot;entangled objects&quot; and their roles as both gifts and commodities.

===Proscriptions===
Many societies have strong prohibitions against turning gifts into trade or capital goods. Anthropologist Wendy James writes that among the Uduk people of northeast Africa there is a strong custom that any gift that crosses subclan boundaries must be consumed rather than invested. For example, an animal given as a gift must be eaten, not bred. However, as in the example of the Trobriand armbands and necklaces, this &quot;perishing&quot; may not consist of consumption as such, but of the gift moving on. In other societies, it is a matter of giving some other gift, either directly in return or to another party. To keep the gift and not give another in exchange is reprehensible. &quot;In folk tales,&quot; Lewis Hyde remarks, &quot;the person who tries to hold onto a gift usually dies.&quot;

Daniel Everett, a linguist who studied the small Pirahã tribe of hunter-gatherers in Brazil, reported that, while they are aware of food preservation using drying, salting, and so forth, they reserve their use for items bartered outside the tribe. Within the group, when someone has a successful hunt they immediately share the abundance by inviting others to enjoy a feast. Asked about this practice, one hunter laughed and replied, &quot;I store meat in the belly of my brother.&quot;

Carol Stack&#x27;s &quot;All Our Kin&quot; describes both the positive and negative sides of a network of obligation and gratitude effectively constituting a gift economy. Her narrative of The Flats, a poor Chicago neighborhood, tells in passing the story of two sisters who each came into a small inheritance. One sister hoarded the inheritance and prospered materially for some time, but was alienated from the community. Her marriage broke up, and she integrated herself back into the community largely by giving gifts. The other sister fulfilled the community&#x27;s expectations, but within six weeks had nothing material to show for the inheritance but a coat and a pair of shoes.

== Case studies: prestations ==

Marcel Mauss was careful to distinguish &quot;gift economies&quot; (reciprocity) in market societies from the &quot;total prestations&quot; given in non-market societies. A prestation is a service provided out of obligation, like &quot;community service&quot;. These &quot;prestations&quot; bring together domains across political, religious, legal, moral and economic definitions, such that the exchange can be seen to be embedded in non-economic social institutions. These prestations are often competitive, as in the potlatch, Kula exchange, and Moka exchange.

=== Moka exchange in Papua New Guinea: competitive exchange ===
The &quot;Moka&quot; is a highly ritualized system of exchange in the Mount Hagen area of Papua New Guinea, that has become emblematic of the anthropological concepts of a &quot;gift economy&quot; and of a &quot;big man&quot; political system. Moka are reciprocal gifts that raise the social status of the giver if the gift is larger than one that the giver received. &quot;Moka&quot; refers specifically to the increment in the size of the gift. The gifts are of a limited range of goods, primarily pigs and scarce pearl shells from the coast. To return the same value as one has received in a moka is simply to repay a debt, strict reciprocity. Moka is the extra. To some, this represents interest on an investment. However, one is not bound to provide moka, only to repay the debt. One adds moka to the gift to increase one&#x27;s prestige, and to place the receiver in debt. It is this constant renewal of the debt relationship which keeps the relationship alive; a debt fully paid off ends further interaction. Giving more than one receives establishes a reputation as a Big man, whereas the simple repayment of debt, or failure to fully repay, pushes one&#x27;s reputation towards the other end of the scale, &quot;rubbish man&quot;. Gift exchange thus has a political effect; granting prestige or status to one, and a sense of debt in the other. A political system can be built out of these kinds of status relationships. Sahlins characterizes the difference between status and rank by highlighting that Big man is not a role; it is a status that is shared by many. The Big man is &quot;not a prince &quot;of&quot; men&quot;, but a &quot;prince among men&quot;. The &quot;big man&quot; system is based on the ability to persuade, rather than command.

=== Toraja funerals: the politics of meat distribution ===
The Toraja are an ethnic group indigenous to a mountainous region of South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Torajans are renowned for their elaborate funeral rites, burial sites carved into rocky cliffs, and massive peaked-roof traditional houses known as &quot;tongkonan&quot; which are owned by noble families. Membership in a tongkonan is inherited by all descendants of its founders. Thus any individual may be a member of numerous tongkonan, as long as they contribute to its ritual events. Membership in a tongkonan carries benefits, such as the right to rent some of its rice fields.

Toraja funeral rites are important social events, usually attended by hundreds of people and lasting several days. The funerals are like &quot;big men&quot; competitions where all the descendants of a tongkonan compete through gifts of sacrificial cattle. Participants have invested cattle with others over the years, and draw on those extended networks to make the largest gift. The winner of the competition becomes the new owner of the tongkonan and its rice lands. They display all the cattle horns from their winning sacrifice on a pole in front of the tongkonan.

The Toraja funeral differs from the &quot;big man&quot; system in that the winner of the &quot;gift&quot; exchange gains control of the Tongkonan&#x27;s property. It creates a clear social hierarchy between the noble owners of the tongkonan and its land, and the commoners who are forced to rent their fields from him. Since the owners of the tongkonan gain rent, they are better able to compete in the funeral gift exchanges, and their social rank is more stable than the &quot;big man&quot; system.

== Charity and alms giving ==

Anthropologist David Graeber argued that the great world religious traditions of charity and gift giving emerged almost simultaneously during the Axial Age (800 to 200 BCE), when coinage was invented and market economies were established on a continental basis. Graeber argues that these charity traditions emerged as a reaction against the nexus formed by coinage, slavery, military violence and the market (a &quot;military-coinage&quot; complex). The new world religions, including Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Christianity, and Islam all sought to preserve &quot;human economies&quot; where money served to cement social relationships rather than purchase things (including people).

Charity and alms-giving are religiously sanctioned voluntary gifts given without expectation of return. However, case studies show that such gifting is not necessarily altruistic.

=== Merit making in Buddhist Thailand ===

Theravada Buddhism in Thailand emphasizes the importance of giving alms (merit making) without any intention of return (a pure gift), which is best accomplished according to doctrine, through gifts to monks and temples. The emphasis is on the selfless gifting which &quot;earns merit&quot; (and a future better life) for the giver rather than on the relief of the poor or the recipient on whom the gift is bestowed. However, Bowie&#x27;s research shows that this ideal form of gifting is limited to the rich who have the resources to endow temples and sponsor the ordination of monks. Monks come from these same families, so this gifting doctrine has a class element. Poorer farmers place much less emphasis on merit making through gifts to monks and temples. They equally validate gifting to beggars. Poverty and famine is widespread among these poorer groups, and by validating gift-giving to beggars, they are in fact demanding that the rich see to their needs in hard times. Bowie sees this as an example of a moral economy (see below) in which the poor use gossip and reputation to resist elite exploitation and pressure them to ease their &quot;this world&quot; suffering.

=== Charity: Dana in India ===
Dāna is a form of religious charity given in Hindu India. The gift is said to embody the sins of the giver (the &quot;poison of the gift&quot;), whom it frees of evil by transmitting it to the recipient. The merit of the gift depends on finding a worthy recipient such as a Brahmin priest. Priests are supposed to be able to digest the sin through ritual action and transmit the gift with increment to someone of greater worth. It is imperative that this be a true gift, with no reciprocity, or the evil will return. The gift is not intended to create any relationship between donor and recipient, and there should never be a return gift. Dana thus transgresses the so-called universal &quot;norm of reciprocity&quot;.

=== The Children of Peace in Canada ===

The Children of Peace (1812–1889) were a utopian Quaker sect. Today, they are primarily remembered for the Sharon Temple, a national historic site and an architectural symbol of their vision of a society based on the values of peace, equality and social justice. They built this ornate temple to raise money for the poor, and built the province of Ontario&#x27;s first shelter for the homeless. They took a lead role in organizing the province&#x27;s first co-operative, the Farmers&#x27; Storehouse, and opened the province&#x27;s first credit union. The group soon found that the charity they tried to distribute from their Temple fund endangered the poor. Accepting charity was a sign of indebtedness, and the debtor could be jailed without trial at the time; this was the &quot;poison of the gift&quot;. They thus transformed their charity fund into a credit union that loaned small sums like today&#x27;s micro-credit institutions. This is an example of singularization, as money was transformed into charity in the Temple ceremony, then shifted to an alternative exchange sphere as a loan. Interest on the loan was then singularized, and transformed back into charity.

==Gifting as non-commodified exchange in market societies==
Non-commodified spheres of exchange exist in relation to the market economy. They are created through the processes of singularization as specific objects are de-commodified for a variety of reasons and enter an alternative exchange sphere. It may be in opposition to the market and to its perceived greed. It may also be used by corporations as a means of creating a sense of endebtedness and loyalty in customers. Modern marketing techniques often aim at infusing commodity exchange with features of gift exchange, thus blurring the presumably sharp distinction between gifts and commodities.

=== Organ transplant networks, sperm and blood banks ===
Market economies tend to &quot;reduce everything – including human beings, their labor, and their reproductive capacity – to the status of commodities&quot;. &quot;The rapid transfer of organ transplant technology to the third world has created a trade in organs, with sick bodies travelling to the Global South for transplants, and healthy organs from the Global South being transported to the richer Global North, &quot;creating a kind of &#x27;Kula ring&#x27; of bodies and body parts.&quot; However, all commodities can also be singularized, or de-commodified, and transformed into gifts. In North America, it is illegal to sell organs, and citizens are enjoined to give the &quot;gift of life&quot; and donate their organs in an organ gift economy. However, this gift economy is a &quot;medical realm rife with potent forms of mystified commodification&quot;. This multimillion-dollar medical industry requires clients to pay steep fees for the gifted organ, which creates clear class divisions between those who donate (often in the global south) and will never benefit from gifted organs, and those who can pay the fees and thereby receive a gifted organ.

Unlike body organs, blood and semen have been successfully and legally commodified in the United States. Blood and semen can thus be commodified, but once consumed are &quot;the gift of life&quot;. Although both can be either donated or sold, are perceived as the &quot;gift of life&quot; yet are stored in &quot;banks&quot;, and can be collected only under strict government regulated procedures, recipients very clearly prefer altruistically donated semen and blood. The blood and semen samples with the highest market value are those that have been altruistically donated. The recipients view semen as storing the potential characteristics of their unborn child in its DNA, and value altruism over greed. Similarly, gifted blood is the archetype of a pure gift relationship because the donor is only motivated by a desire to help others.

=== Copyleft vs copyright: the gift of &quot;free&quot; speech ===

Engineers, scientists and software developers have created free software projects such as the Linux kernel and the GNU operating system. They are prototypical examples for the gift economy&#x27;s prominence in the technology sector, and its active role in instating the use of permissive free software and copyleft licenses, which allow free reuse of software and knowledge. Other examples include file-sharing, open access, unlicensed software and so on.

=== Points and loyalty programs ===

Many retail organizations have &quot;gift&quot; programs meant to encourage customer loyalty to their establishments. Bird-David and Darr refer to these as hybrid &quot;mass-gifts&quot; which are neither gift nor commodity. They are called mass-gifts because they are given away in large numbers &quot;free with purchase&quot; in a mass-consumption environment. They give as an example two bars of soap in which one is given free with purchase: which is the commodity and which the gift? The mass-gift both affirms the distinct difference between gift and commodity while confusing it at the same time. As with gifting, mass-gifts are used to create a social relationship. Some customers embrace the relationship and gift whereas others reject the gift relationship and interpret the &quot;gift&quot; as a 50% off sale.

=== Free shops ===
&quot;Give-away shops&quot;, &quot;freeshops&quot; or &quot;free stores&quot; are stores where all goods are free. They are similar to charity shops, with mostly second-hand itemsonly everything is available at no cost. Whether it is a book, a piece of furniture, a garment or a household item, it is all freely given away, although some operate a one-in, one-out–type policy (swap shops). The free store is a form of constructive direct action that provides a shopping alternative to a monetary framework, allowing people to exchange goods and services outside a money-based economy. The anarchist 1960s countercultural group The Diggers opened free stores which gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art. The Diggers took their name from the original English Diggers led by Gerrard Winstanley and sought to create a mini-society free of money and capitalism.

=== Burning Man ===

Burning Man is a week-long annual art and community event held in the Black Rock Desert in northern Nevada, in the United States. The event is described as an experiment in community, radical self-expression, and radical self-reliance. The event forbids commerce (except for ice, coffee, and tickets to the event itself) and encourages gifting. Gifting is one of the 10 guiding principles, as participants to Burning Man (both the desert festival and the year-round global community) are encouraged to rely on a gift economy. The practice of gifting at Burning Man is also documented by the 2002 documentary film &quot;Gifting It: A Burning Embrace of Gift Economy&quot;, as well as by Making Contact&#x27;s radio show &quot;How We Survive: The Currency of Giving [encore]&quot;.

===Cannabis market in the District of Columbia and U.S. states===

According to the Associated Press, &quot;Gift-giving has long been a part of marijuana culture&quot; and has accompanied legalization in U.S. states in the 2010s. Voters in the District of Columbia legalized the growing of cannabis for personal recreational use by approving Initiative 71 in November 2014, but the 2015 &quot;Cromnibus&quot; Federal appropriations bills prevented the District from creating a system to allow for its commercial sale. Possession, growth, and use of the drug by adults is legal in the District, as is giving it away, but sale and barter of it is not, in effect attempting to create a gift economy. However it ended up creating a commercial market linked to selling other objects. Preceding the January, 2018 legalization of cannabis possession in Vermont without a corresponding legal framework for sales, it was expected that a similar market would emerge there. For a time, people in Portland, Oregon, could only legally obtain cannabis as a gift, which was celebrated in the Burnside Burn rally. For a time, a similar situation ensued after possession was legalized in California, Maine and Massachusetts.

===Mutual aid===
Many anarchists, particularly anarcho-primitivists and anarcho-communists, believe that variations on a gift economy may be the key to breaking the cycle of poverty. Therefore, they often desire to refashion all of society into a gift economy. Anarcho-communists advocate a gift economy as an ideal, with neither money, nor markets, nor planning. This view traces back at least to Peter Kropotkin, who saw in the hunter-gatherer tribes he had visited the paradigm of &quot;mutual aid&quot;. In place of a market, anarcho-communists, such as those who lived in some Spanish villages in the 1930s, support a gift economy without currency, where goods and services are produced by workers and distributed in community stores where everyone (including the workers who produced them) is essentially entitled to consume whatever they want or need as payment for their production of goods and services.

As an intellectual abstraction, mutual aid was developed and advanced by mutualism or labor insurance systems and thus trade unions, and has been also used in cooperatives and other civil society movements. Typically, mutual-aid groups are free to join and participate in, and all activities are voluntary. Often they are structured as non-hierarchical, non-bureaucratic non-profit organizations, with members controlling all resources and no external financial or professional support. They are member-led and member-organized. They are egalitarian in nature, and designed to support participatory democracy, equality of member status and power, and shared leadership and cooperative decision-making. Members&#x27; external societal status is considered irrelevant inside the group: status in the group is conferred by participation.

===Moral economy===
English historian E.P. Thompson wrote about the moral economy of the poor in the context of widespread English food riots in the English countryside in the late 18th century. Thompson claimed that these riots were generally peaceable acts that demonstrated a common political culture rooted in feudal rights to &quot;set the price&quot; of essential goods in the market. These peasants believed that a traditional &quot;fair price&quot; was more important to the community than a &quot;free&quot; market price and they punished large farmers who sold their surpluses at higher prices outside the village while some village members still needed produce. Thus a moral economy is an attempt to preserve an alternative exchange sphere from market penetration. The notion of peasants with a non-capitalist cultural mentality using the market for their own ends has been linked to subsistence agriculture and the need for subsistence insurance in hard times. However, James C. Scott points out that those who provide this subsistence insurance to the poor in bad years are wealthy patrons who exact a political cost for their aid; this aid is given to recruit followers. The concept of moral economy has been used to explain why peasants in a number of colonial contexts, such as the Vietnam War, have rebelled.

===The commons===
Some may confuse common property regimes with gift exchange systems. The commons is the cultural and natural resources accessible to all members of a society, including natural materials such as air, water, and a habitable earth. These resources are held in common, not owned privately. The resources held in common can include everything from natural resources and common land to software. The commons contains public property and private property, over which people have certain traditional rights. When commonly held property is transformed into private property this process is called &quot;enclosure&quot; or &quot;privatization&quot;. A person who has a right in, or over, common land jointly with another or others is called a commoner.

There are a number of important aspects that can be used to describe true commons. The first is that the commons cannot be commodified – if they are, they cease to be commons. The second aspect is that unlike private property, the commons are inclusive rather than exclusive – their nature is to share ownership as widely, rather than as narrowly, as possible. The third aspect is that the assets in commons are meant to be preserved regardless of their return of capital. Just as we receive them as a shared right, so we have a duty to pass them on to future generations in at least the same condition as we received them. If we can add to their value, so much the better, but at a minimum we must not degrade them, and we certainly have no right to destroy them.

===New intellectual commons: free content===

Free content, or free information, is any kind of functional work, artwork, or other creative content that meets the definition of a free cultural work. A free cultural work is one which has no significant legal restriction on people&#x27;s freedom:
* To use the content and benefit from using it,
* To study the content and apply what is learned,
* To make and distribute copies of the content,
* To change and improve the content and distribute these derivative works.

Although different definitions are used, free content is legally similar if not identical to open content. An analogy is the use of the rival terms free software and open source which describe ideological differences rather than legal ones. Free content encompasses all works in the public domain and also those copyrighted works whose licenses honor and uphold the freedoms mentioned above. Because copyright law in most countries by default grants copyright holders monopolistic control over their creations, copyright content must be explicitly declared free, usually by the referencing or inclusion of licensing statements from within the work.

Although a work which is in the public domain because its copyright has expired is considered free, it can become non-free again if the copyright law changes.

Information is particularly suited to gift economies, as information is a nonrival good and can be gifted at practically no cost (zero marginal cost). In fact, there is often an advantage to using the same software or data formats as others, so even from a selfish perspective, it can be advantageous to give away one&#x27;s information.

====Filesharing====
Markus Giesler, in his ethnography &quot;Consumer Gift System&quot;, described music downloading as a system of social solidarity based on gift transactions. As Internet access spread, file sharing became extremely popular among users who could contribute and receive files on line. This form of gift economy was a model for online services such as Napster, which focused on music sharing and was later sued for copyright infringement. Nonetheless, online file sharing persists in various forms such as BitTorrent and direct download link. A number of communications and intellectual property experts such as Henry Jenkins and Lawrence Lessig have described file-sharing as a form of gift exchange which provides many benefits to artists and consumers alike. They have argued that file sharing fosters community among distributors and allows for a more equitable distribution of media.

====Free and open-source software====
In his essay &quot;Homesteading the Noosphere&quot;, noted computer programmer Eric S. Raymond said that free and open-source software developers have created &quot;a &#x27;gift culture&#x27; in which participants compete for prestige by giving time, energy, and creativity away&quot;. Prestige gained as a result of contributions to source code fosters a social network for the developer; the open source community will recognize the developer&#x27;s accomplishments and intelligence. Consequently, the developer may find more opportunities to work with other developers. However, prestige is not the only motivator for the giving of lines of code. An anthropological study of the Fedora community, as part of a master&#x27;s study at the University of North Texas in 2010–11, found that common reasons given by contributors were &quot;learning for the joy of learning and collaborating with interesting and smart people&quot;. Motivation for personal gain, such as career benefits, was more rarely reported. Many of those surveyed said things like, &quot;Mainly I contribute just to make it work for me&quot;, and &quot;programmers develop software to &#x27;scratch an itch. The International Institute of Infonomics at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands reported in 2002 that in addition to the above, large corporations, and they specifically mentioned IBM, also spend large annual sums employing developers specifically for them to contribute to open source projects. The firms&#x27; and the employees&#x27; motivations in such cases are less clear.

Members of the Linux community often speak of their community as a gift economy. The IT research firm IDC valued the Linux kernel at US$18 billion in 2007 and projected its value at US$40 billion in 2010. The Debian distribution of the GNU/Linux operating system offers over 37,000 free open-source software packages via their AMD64 repositories alone.

====Collaborative works====
Collaborative works are works created by an open community. For example, Wikipediaa free online encyclopediafeatures millions of articles developed collaboratively, and almost none of its many authors and editors receive any direct material reward.

The concept of a gift economy has played a large role in works of fiction about alternative societies, especially in works of science fiction. Examples include:

* &quot;News from Nowhere&quot; (1890) by William Morris is a utopian novel about a society which operates on a gift economy.
* &quot;The Great Explosion&quot; (1962) by Eric Frank Russell describes the encounter of a military survey ship and a Gandhian pacifist society that operates as a gift economy.
* &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; (1974) by Ursula K. Le Guin is a novel about a gift economy society that had exiled themselves from their (capitalist) home planet.
* The Mars trilogy, a series of books written by Kim Stanley Robinson in the 1990s, suggests that new human societies that develop away from Earth could migrate toward a gift economy.
* The movie &quot;Pay It Forward&quot; (2000) centers on a schoolboy who, for a school project, comes up with the idea of doing a good deed for another and then asking the recipient to &quot;pay it forward&quot;. Although the phrase &quot;gift economy&quot; is never explicitly mentioned, the scheme would, in effect, create one.
* &quot;Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom&quot; (2003) by Cory Doctorow describes future society where rejuvenation and body-enhancement have made death obsolete, and material goods are no longer scarce, resulting in a reputation-based (whuffie) economic system.
* &quot;Wizard&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (2003) by Diane Duane describes two young wizards visiting a utopian-like planet whose economy is based on gift-giving and mutual support.
* &quot;Voyage from Yesteryear&quot; (1982) by James P. Hogan describes a society of the embryo colonists of Alpha Centauri who have a post-scarcity gift economy.
* &quot;Cradle of Saturn&quot; (1999) and its sequel &quot;The Anguished Dawn&quot; (2003) by James P. Hogan describe a colonization effort on Saturn&#x27;s largest satellite. Both describe the challenges involved in adopting a new economic paradigm.
* Science fiction author Bruce Sterling wrote a story, &quot;Maneki-neko&quot;, in which the cat-paw gesture is the sign of a secret AI-based gift economy.</text><links>

<text>Port Leyden is a village in Lewis County, New York, United States. The population was 672 at the 2010 census. The name is derived from the village&#x27;s early history as a port on the Black River Canal.

The village of Port Leyden is mostly in the town of Leyden, but a portion of the village lies to the east of the Black River in the town of Lyonsdale. The village is south of Lowville, the county seat, north of Boonville, and by road west-southwest of Old Forge.

== History ==
A mill was built at the present site of the village around 1800, and the community was known as &quot;Kelsey&#x27;s Mills&quot;. The name was changed to &quot;Port Leyden&quot; around 1838 when the Black River Canal was being developed. The canal was completed to Port Leyden in 1850, but was not usable until 1851. The canal reached its northern terminus at Lyons Falls, a few miles north, in 1855. In 1900, a decision was made to abandon the canal between Lyons Falls and Boonville, effectively ending the status of Port Leyden as a canal port.

St. Mark&#x27;s Church and the Edmund Wilson House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

<text>Groveland is a town in Livingston County, New York, United States. The population was 3,249 at the 2010 census. The town is centrally located in the county, south of Geneseo.

== History ==
The Sullivan Expedition (1779) reached its farthest extent here. Groveland was the site of the Boyd and Parker ambush.

In 1792, the first planned European American settlement in Livingston County was located in Groveland and was called &quot;Willamsburgh&quot; after Sir William Pulteney, a land speculator. The town was formed in 1789 as part of Ontario County, later becoming part of Livingston County when it was formed in 1821. Part of Groveland was used to form part of the town of Conesus (1819).

The Groveland Shaker Village settlement was established in 1836 on a farm at the hamlet of Sonyea. Their peak in population was 148 members that year, when they moved from their former location at Sodus. The Shakers sold the Sonyea property in 1892 due to declining membership, and moved to Watervliet. Their former buildings and land became the Craig Colony for Epileptics in 1896 and are now part of the Groveland Correctional Facility.

The Claud No. 1 Archeological Site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The Boyd &amp; Parker Park and Groveland Ambuscade were also listed on the National Register in 2009.

==Notable people==
* Josiah Begole (1815–1896), former governor of Michigan; born in Groveland
* Charles H. Carroll (1794–1865), Whig congressman for New York, 1843–47
* John Vance Cheney (1848–1922), poet, essayist and librarian; born in Groveland
* Charles A. Goheen (1843–1899), Medal of Honor recipient in the American Civil War
* Daniel Kelly (1841–1912), Medal of Honor recipient in the American Civil War
* James Rosebrugh Leaming (1820–1892), noted physician specializing in heart and lung diseases, author, and teacher
* Walter W. Magee (1861–1927), Republican congressman for New York, 1915–27
* Elizabeth Smith Miller (1822–1911), dress reformer and women&#x27;s rights activist; native of Groveland

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.82%, are water. Conesus Lake, one of the Finger Lakes, forms part of the eastern boundary. Canaseraga Creek, a north-flowing tributary of the Genesee River, crosses the southwest part of the town through a broad valley.
Interstate 390 passes north-to-south through the town. New York State Route 36, New York State Route 63, and New York State Route 256 are north-south highways through the town. New York State Route 408 is a highway terminating in the western part of the town at NY-63.

Groveland is on the Rochester-to-Dansville line of the Rochester &amp; Southern Railroad. From 1882–1963, Groveland was on the Main Line of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&amp;W) and successor Erie Lackawanna Railroad. In 1963, the Main Line over Dansville Hill from Groveland to Wayland was abandoned by order of the Interstate Commerce Commission upon application by the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, which had secured much lesser grades on the former Erie Railroad via Hornell. The portion of today&#x27;s R&amp;S line west and north of Groveland was originally part of the DL&amp;W, while the portion between Groveland and Dansville was part of the Dansville and Mount Morris Railroad and predecessors.

<text>Portageville is a hamlet located in the town of Genesee Falls in Wyoming County, New York, United States. Its name derives from the Native American canoeists who would withdraw their craft from the river to avoid going over three waterfalls in the Genesee River gorge now known as Portage Falls. They had to &quot;portage&quot; several miles to the site of present-day Mount Morris, where they could embark for the rest of the journey downriver.

Portageville is the only named community in the town of Genesee Falls.

The Genesee River Gorge with its scenic waterfalls was formed after the original valley was buried in glacial debris from the last ice age and the river had to cut a new valley though the Devonian sedimentary rock of the area. It has also been called &quot;The Grand Canyon of the East&quot;. The site has now been designated Letchworth State Park and is a major tourist attraction, with the lower entrance at Portage.

The First Universalist Church of Portageville, also known as The Portageville Chapel, is a historic Universalist church in Portageville, Wyoming County, New York. It is a Greek Revival style structure with Gothic and Federal elements dating to 1841. The church features a two-stage square tower above the north gable of the building.[3]

<text>Canastota is a village within the town of Lenox in Madison County, New York, United States. The population was 4,556 at the 2020 census, down from 4,804 in 2010.

The village was incorporated in 1835, but was reorganized in 1870. Located along the banks of the Erie Canal, which was completed through the Mohawk River valley by 1825, Canastota was a vibrant trading and commercial town during the mid-nineteenth century for a wide agricultural area and an important stop between the cities of Rome and Syracuse.

Although the section of the canal running through the village was abandoned by the 1920s, much of the section remains intact and is now part of the Old Erie Canal State Historic Park.

The village of Canastota is in the southern part of the town of Lenox and is the home to the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

== History ==
=== Native peoples ===
&quot;Kniste Stota&quot; was the historic name of Canastota, a term used by the local Oneida people, meaning &quot;cluster of pines near still waters&quot;.

The area that makes up Canastota was once inhabited by people of the Oneida Nation, a member of the Haudenosanee confederacy. The Nation&#x27;s homelands before European settlement of central New York consisted of more than six million acres from the St. Lawrence River to the Susquehanna River.

=== Captain Reuben Perkins ===
The village was founded by Captain Reuben Perkins, a veteran of the Revolutionary War who served in the battles of Plattsburgh, Saratoga, and Stony Point. In 1800 Captain Perkins moved his family to a log cabin on Quality Hill, along the Seneca Turnpike. In 1810, Captain Perkins purchased of land from the Oneida Nation and permanently settled his family in a cabin at the intersection of what would become James Street and Main Street. Perkins later won a contract for the two miles of the Erie Canal through Canastota, and served as its superintendent. In 1814 Perkins sold of his land, and in 1832 he sold his remaining land holdings.

=== The Erie Canal ===
Construction of the Erie Canal through Canastota began in 1817. As the waterway was opened from 1819 through 1825, it caused a surge of growth and development in the area. Workers and their employers soon moved their families to the area, and eventually schools, businesses, and religious organizations sprung up.

As soon as this section of the canal was opened, a line of packets was established, making regular trips between Syracuse and Utica, stopping at all intermediate towns. Trade sprang up at once between Canastota and other villages, making it one of the foremost villages in central New York. The first post office was established in 1829 with Ichabod S. Spencer as postmaster, and by 1831 there were three public houses, three stores and a hatter business in the village, and the population totaled 406.

When the canal was superseded by the construction of railroads, and later the New York State Thruway, some canal towns were cut off from the main lines of commerce.

=== Liberty Party National Convention ===
On the first and second days of September 1852, the national convention of the Liberty Party was held at the Dutch Reformed Church in Canastota. Much of the convention&#x27;s business was to hear reports from delegates regarding the attitude towards the abolition of slavery in their respective areas. Among the speakers and attendees were Frederick Douglass, Gerrit Smith, and Jermain Wesley Loguen. Later debate during the convention focused on whether the party should nominate its own presidential candidate or if they should support the nomination of the Free Democracy Party.

The 170th anniversary of the convention was celebrated in 2022, attended by representatives from the village of Canastota, the town of Lenox, and the William G. Pomeroy foundation. A marker was placed as a dedication to the convention on the site where it was held.

=== The Terrible Fire of 1873 ===
On Sunday, October 26, 1873, a fire started in a hay barn located to the east of the village. Some sixty tons of hay and the barn it was stored in burned completely.

Just after 1:30am the following morning, another fire was discovered in a small barn on Spencer Street which soon spread to the Eagle Hotel and other surrounding dwellings and businesses. Urged forward by fierce winds, the fire soon raged through several blocks, leaving smoldering ruins in its wake. In total, over thirty buildings were completely destroyed.

No deaths were reported in the next day&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Canastota Herald&quot;, though many were reported to have sustained serious burns to their faces and hands as they worked tirelessly to retrieve personal items and other goods from the burning buildings. Many of the early records of the village were lost in this fire.

The &quot;Herald&quot; later reported that in a letter to the Relief Committee, Gerrit Smith wrote, &quot;Let not Canastota despair. She has still more left than she has lost. She has the sympathies and prayers of her fellowman left; above all, the loving God is left to her.&quot; Mr. Smith enclosed his letter with a check for $1,000.

=== 1908 New York to Paris Race ===
The 1908 Race from New York to Paris travelled directly through Canastota.

=== 2024 tornado ===
On July 16, 2024, the town suffered considerable damage from an EF1 tornado. One person was killed by the tornado.

==Geography==
Canastota is in the southern part of the town of Lenox. Interstate 90, the New York State Thruway, passes through the northern part of the village, with access from Exit 34. I-90 leads east to Utica and west to the Syracuse area. New York State Route 13 passes through the center of Canastota as Peterboro Street and leads north to Sylvan Beach at the east end of Oneida Lake. State Route 5 runs along the southern border of Canastota, leading east to Oneida and west to Chittenango.

The average household size was 2.36 and the average family size was 2.96.

In the village, the population was spread out, with 25.3% under the age of 18, 7.2% from 18 to 24, 28.7% from 25 to 44, 20.9% from 45 to 64, and 17.9% who were 65 years of age or older.

About 10.0% of families and 14.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 19.5% of those under age 18 and 19.8% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==
The presence of fertile soils made Canastota an agricultural center in Central New York and a source of vegetables for the region. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many Italian families immigrated here to become tenant farmers and landowners. The village was sometimes referred to as the onion capital of the world, and onions once accounted for a large portion of the village income.

During the 1850s, Charles Spencer constructed compound microscopes and achromatic objective microscopes. Robert Tolles became his partner. The manufacturing operation moved elsewhere following the fire of 1873.

In 1893, David S. Watson moved his wagon building company, Watson Wagons, to a former broomstick factory building in Canastota, alongside the railroad and the Erie Canal. In 1899, Watson Wagons had 300 employees in Canastota and sold over 100 wagons, costing $104 for the base model. Watson Wagons were unique in that they had a mechanism to allow the operator to drop the wagon&#x27;s contents through the bottom of the wagon bed. The wagons were used in agriculture, waste management, and road development. Eventually, they also saw use in World War I, when France and the United States purchased 15,000 wagons to carry engineering equipment and artillery. Watson sold his shares of the company in 1908, but the factory continued to sell wagons until 1933. The factory went through many changes after the great depression, and eventually turned to manufacturing Rex school buses. The factory, for some time, was operated by Oneida Limited, and then by Henney Motor Company, where some of the United States&#x27; first electric automobiles were made.

Herman Casler of Canastota invented the Biograph, an early motion picture machine. The first showing of movies using of the biograph occurred at the Bruce Opera House in Canastota. In 1904, Harry D. Weed invented the Tire chain, and patented his invention while working for the Marvin and Casler Machine Shop in Canastota.

==Arts and culture==
There are 16 sites in Canastota listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This includes the Canastota Canal Town Museum.

<text>Chittenango is a village in Madison County, New York, United States. It is in the southern part of the town of Sullivan. The population was 4,896 at the 2020 census. Chittenango is the birthplace of L. Frank Baum, author of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;.

== History ==
The name of the village is derived from the Oneida name for Chittenango Creek, &quot;Chu-de-nääng′&quot;, meaning &quot;where waters run north&quot;. While the name &quot;Chittenango&quot; is often thought by locals to mean &quot;river flowing north&quot; or &quot;where the waters divide and run north&quot;, a reference to the direction of water flow from the creek&#x27;s point of origin to Oneida Lake, there is no derivation for these alternatives. On an 1825 map of the area, the village is called &quot;Chittening&quot;, a name used by early settlers which is thought to be derived directly from &quot;Chu-de-nääng′&quot;. According to American anthropologist Lewis H. Morgan, who studied Iroquois customs and language in his 1851 book &quot;League of the Iroquois&quot;, the name &quot;Chittenango&quot; may have come from &quot;Chu-de-nääng′ Ga-hun′-da&quot;, a redundant combination of the Oneida terms for &quot;Chittenango Creek&quot; (&quot;Chu-de-nääng′&quot;) and &quot;creek&quot; (&quot;Ga-hun′-da&quot;).

Initial growth of the village is largely attributed to the construction of the Erie Canal, which officially opened in 1825, joining Buffalo on Lake Erie with Albany, the capital of New York, and the Hudson River. The Erie Canal passes just north of the village. The Chittenango Canal Company, incorporated in 1818, constructed a canal in length connecting Chittenango to the Erie Canal. The village became a virtual canal town upon the construction of the Chittenango Canal Boat Landing, which featured a three-bay dry dock where canal boats were built and repaired. The canal brought prosperity, growth and expansion to the village. It created a need for inns, hotels and restaurants, and area farms and factories found the canal useful as an inexpensive and easy way to ship goods further along the canal or beyond. Because the canal connected to the Hudson River, boats were able to ship goods south to the metropolis of Manhattan.

Development increased considerably with the activities of John B. Yates, who opened and operated grist and saw mills, a woolen mill, stores, and founded the village&#x27;s first church in 1828, the Dutch Reformed Church, now the First Presbyterian Church of Chittenango.

The village was incorporated on March 15, 1842. At the time, it contained between 900 and 1,000 inhabitants, about 180 dwellings, three churches, the Yates Polytechnic Institute, a large woolen factory, two large water lime factories, one flouring mill, three taverns and ten stores. In 1853, the first bank in the village, the Chittenango Bank, was organized and began business with capital of $110,000, which increased to $150,000 one year later. The bank closed business nearly one decade later, and in December 1863 the First National Bank of Chittenango was organized, occupying the same building erected by the first bank. This bank also closed down in 1883.

Soon after the incorporation of the village, the first fire company and engine house was built in 1843.

The first newspaper in the village was the &quot;Chittenango Herald&quot;, established in 1831 by Isaac Lyon. It later bore successively the name of the &quot;Chittenango Republican&quot;, &quot;Chittenango Phoenix&quot;, and &quot;Democratic Gazette&quot;, until it was discontinued in 1853. In 1869 the &quot;Madison County Times&quot; was established and papers were published until 1975, at which time the &quot;Chittenango-Bridgeport Times&quot; was formed. This paper ran until 2009 when it merged with other Syracuse area papers to form the current &quot;Eagle Newspapers&quot;.

The Chittenango Pottery Company, largely owing its early success to its location near the Chittenango Landing, was established in 1897. After burning down twice, the present, now abandoned brick structure was erected. After years of neglect and disrepair, the building was demolished in 2015.

The Chittenango Pottery and St. Paul&#x27;s Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Culture==
Chittenango holds a three-day annual festival called Oz-Stravaganza!, formerly called OzFest, to celebrate the literary works of author L. Frank Baum, who was born in Chittenango on May 15, 1856. The children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; was published on May 17, 1900. The weekend-long festival, usually held during the first Friday/Saturday of June and the weekend thereof, includes amusement rides, and a parade, which features many community groups. The parade has also featured actors and actresses who played Munchkins in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, including Jerry Maren, Karl Slover, Meinhardt Raabe, and Margaret Williams Pellegrini.

Oz-Stravaganza! was cancelled during 2020 and 2021 due to health concerns over Covid-19. As Covid restrictions were gradually lifted, the festival came back in 2022, though on a smaller scale, with a lower amount of vendors than previous festival years.

The Wizard of Oz theme continues beyond the annual festival. The village is the home of the International L. Frank Baum &amp; All Things Oz Historical Foundation. The group is a 501(c)3 non-profit, and is 100% volunteer run. It is Chartered by the NY State Board of Regents. The organization coordinates the annual Oz-Stravaganza festival and also the All Things Oz Museum located in the historic village downtown. The museum features a collection of original costumes and props from the OZ universe, as well as collectibles and Baum family heirlooms. The foundation collection is nearly 15,000 items, and 1,200 - 1,400 are on exhibit at any time.

In 1982, the village installed a brick sidewalk on either side of the downtown portion of Genesee Street which was painted yellow as an homage to the yellow brick road from the novels and film. The sidewalk required regular upkeep as the color would fade over time and the bricks would chip and crack due to the freeze-thaw cycles in the colder months and regular use throughout the year. As part of a downtown Chittenango revitalization project in 2007, the sidewalks were replaced with concrete which was then stamped and colored to replicate the yellow brick road. The old bricks have been made available to purchase at the All Things Oz museum and during the festival to raise money for the town&#x27;s festival. In 2017, the village also added a yellow brick road sidewalk to Dr. West memorial park where the annual Oz-stravaganza festival is held.

Chittenango and its yellow brick road featured in episode 6 of Michael Portillo&#x27;s &quot;Great American Railroad Journeys&quot; shown on the BBC. 
Chittenango also features a new Wizard of Oz-themed casino that opened on June 2, 2015, called the Yellow Brick Road Casino, operated by the Oneida Indian tribe that also operates the much larger Turning Stone Casino and Resort located near Verona, New York.

<text>Oneida () is a city in Madison County in the U.S. state of New York. It is located west of Oneida Castle (in Oneida County) and east of Wampsville. The population was 10,329 at the 2020 census, down from 11,390 in 2010. The city, like both Oneida County and the nearby silver and china maker, was named for the Oneida people, who had a large territory here around Oneida Lake during the colonial period.

==History==
In the post-Revolutionary period, central and western New York were settled by many migrants from New England. With development of the Erie Canal in the early 19th century, the movement of people expanded towards the Midwest as trade and commerce increased. Oneida&#x27;s development began to pick up as new trade routes were opened, especially in the period initially following construction of the Oneida Lake canal and feeder and an associated railroad stop, tying it into major trade networks of the day.
The village of Oneida was incorporated on June 20, 1848, as part of the larger town of Lenox to its west, but years of friction among the different sections of town spurred the village to establish itself independently as the new Town of Oneida in 1896. In turn, this town was later chartered as the City of Oneida on March 28, 1901.

The city&#x27;s first elected mayor was Julius M. Goldstein, the co-founder of Powell &amp; Goldstein Cigar Company. Goldstein was born in Prussia and immigrated in 1871.

Oneida is located near the site of the former Oneida Community, a social and religious experiment that flourished during the third quarter of the 19th century. The community, founded by John Humphrey Noyes, lasted from 1848 until 1881. It produced silk and canned goods until the manufacturing of flatware picked up in the later years of the community&#x27;s existence. This led to the foundation in 1880 of Oneida Limited, a company that outlasted the community and became one of America&#x27;s most important flatware producers in the 20th century. The company is still headquartered in the city, although all US manufacturing operations have now ceased and all Oneida products are imported. The Oneida Community Mansion House, a National Historic Landmark, is preserved as the principal building of the Oneida Community.

Oneida has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Main-Broad-Grove Streets Historic District, Cottage Lawn, DeFerriere House, Mount Hope Reservoir, Oneida Armory, Oneida Community Mansion House, and United States Post Office.

==Geography==
Oneida is in northeastern Madison County, bordered to the northeast by Oneida County. New York State Route 5 passes through the city south of its center, leading east into neighboring Oneida Castle and continuing to Utica; and west into neighboring Wampsville and to Syracuse.

<text>Stockbridge is a town in Madison County, New York, United States. The population was 1,972 at the 2020 census, down from 2,103 in 2010. The name is derived from a group of Native Americans.

== History ==
The land surrounding where Stockbridge would be established was lived upon by &quot;Stockbridge Indians&quot; (as local settlers would refer to them), who had been relocated already to the New Stockbridge Indian Territory during the latter half of the 18th century, being told that this land was to be reserved for future tribal generations. The Stockbridge, refugees mainly of adjoining tribes in New York who had settled in the &quot;praying town&quot; of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, accepted an invitation of the Oneida people to live and share on their reservation in New York. Subsequent disagreements with White settlers caused many Stockbridge Indians to relocate to Indiana and later to Wisconsin, where they became the Stockbridge–Munsee Band of the Mohican Nation.

The town was settled in 1791 by pioneers from New England. The town was formed in 1836 from parts of four other towns: Augusta, Lenox, Smithfield and Vernon.

Stockbridge is the birthplace of meatpacking industrialist Philip Danforth Armour and his brother Herman Ossian Armour.

<text>Brockport is a village in Monroe County, New York, United States. Most of the village is within the town of Sweden, with two small portions in the town of Clarkson. The population was 7,104 at the 2020 U.S. census, down from 8,366 in 2010. The name is derived from Heil Brockway, an early settler. It is home to SUNY Brockport.

Brockport is called &quot;the Victorian village on the Erie Canal&quot;. In 2021 the village portion of the Erie Canal was remodeled, providing a bricked walkway, a brand-new canal visitor center, and several pieces of art of historical significance.

== History ==
Prior to European settlement, the area that makes up modern Brockport was primarily occupied by the Muoio Indian tribe, a part of the Seneca (a member of the Iroquois Confederacy). The Muoio people were sustained in the region mostly by hunting indigenous wildlife such as deer and the occasional black bear. Shortly after white settlers arrived, most of the Muoio died of disease and the few survivors traveled to Canada.

The village of Brockport was founded by Heil Brockway in 1822 and incorporated in 1829. The village grew to importance as a port on the Erie Canal. Brockport was briefly the canal&#x27;s terminus until it was extended to its final western end at Buffalo.

The Brockport Collegiate Institute was founded in 1841. It was a private academy, part of the widespread academy movement of the time. In October 1869, Gamma Sigma Fraternity was founded at the Brockport Normal School. Gamma Sigma was the first high school fraternity started in the United States. SUNY Brockport officially called the &quot;State University of New York Brockport&quot;, is the descendant of that institute and is known for its teaching and nursing programs. It boasts the Morgan–Manning House, a Victorian era home built in 1854 on Main Street (NY 19).

During the American Civil War the men of Brockport formed all of Company A (100 men) of the 140th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, formed in September 1862 at Rochester. Brockport&#x27;s total population was little more than 2,100 people at the time. Additional volunteers from Brockport helped form Company H of the 140th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Company A&#x27;s heroics helped secure the flank of the 5th Maine and stabilized a bad situation on Little Round Top at the Battle of Gettysburg. The 140th New York regiment also saw action at the Battle of the Wilderness, the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, and the Appomatox Courthouse Campaign. The 140th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment was mustered out on June 3, 1865, near Alexandria, Virginia.

There has long been a legend that due to a conflict between two of Brockport&#x27;s founders, there are no intersections on Main Street that meet up squarely. This is not true, since State and Erie streets line up because they used to be a trolley path that ran all the way to Rochester. Adams and Fair streets meet up as well, and so do the streets of Brockway Place and South Avenue.

Due to financial difficulties the village was under threat of dissolution, and could have become a part of the town of Sweden pending a referendum by the village&#x27;s residents, but the referendum failed on June 15, 2010. However, there was another dissolution vote on May 24, 2016, which also failed.

===Sites of interest===
The Erie Canal runs through the village of Brockport, as well as several other area villages and towns.

<text>Clarkson is a town in Monroe County, New York, United States, on the western border of the county and west of the city of Rochester. The population was 6,904 at the 2020 census. The town is named after General Matthew Clarkson.

==History==

Matthew Clarkson was an extensive landowner in this locality, who gave to the town. Clarkson was formed from the town of Murray on April 2, 1819. Clarkson was reduced to form the town of Union (the present town of Hamlin) in 1852.

It has been claimed that Moddy Freeman was the first settler in Clarkson. James Sayres purchased at Clarkson Corners in 1804 and was the first settler on the Ridge Road. Eli Blodgett also settled here in 1804, and there were many others prior to 1809. In 1819 and a year or two thereafter, settlement and development progressed rapidly. It was the home of Henry R. Seldon, judge of the Court of Appeals, and later lieutenant governor of New York. The first male child born was a son to Mrs. Clarkson; the first female birth was that of Betsey Palmer, in 1812. Charlotte Cummings taught the first school, in 1812. Henry McCall kept the first store, about 1810. Isaac Williams built the first frame house and was the first blacksmith. Dr. Noah Owen was the first physician and Dr. Rowe the second. John Bowman was the first lawyer. The first and about the only newspaper published in Clarkson was the &quot;Jeffersonian&quot;, in 1835, which continued for only a year. The first sawmill was erected previous to 1811, by James Sayres, and stood a half-mile east of the corners. Several distilleries were among the early industries along the Ridge Road. A post-office was established in 1816, Dr. Baldwin being the first postmaster.

Ridge Road was an important thoroughfare during the war times of 1812-15, and Clarkson was the general rendezvous for troops and the temporary depository for supplies and munitions of war. Clarkson village, then known as &quot;Murray Corners&quot;, was a hamlet of considerable note, the Ridge Road being the main route between Canandaigua and Lewiston. The Corners was a stopping-place where horses were changed and travelers allowed a brief respite, but since the completion of the Erie Canal, and the still later construction of the New York Central Railroad, the neighboring town of Sweden has gained ascendency and profited, while Clarkson has correspondingly lost in commercial importance.

==Geography==
Clarkson is northwestern Monroe County and is bordered to the south by the village of Brockport and to the west by Orleans County. New York State Route 272 forms part of the county line. New York State Route 104 (Ridge Road) is the east-west highway through Clarkson, leading east to the northern part of Rochester and west to Lewiston. Route 19 crosses Route 104 at Clarkson Corners, leading north to Hamlin and to Lake Ontario, and south through Brockport to the New York State Thruway and Interstate 490.

<text>Fairport is a village in the town of Perinton, part of Monroe County, New York, United States. Fairport is a suburb of Rochester and is known as the &quot;crown jewel of the Erie Canal&quot;. The population of the village was 5,501 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The town of Perinton was first settled in the two flat areas of Perinton Center (Turk Hill and Ayrault Roads) and Egypt. What was developed as the village of Fairport was a swampy area in the northern part of the town that was drained in the 1820s by construction of the new Erie Canal. With the opening of the canal, what was then known as Perrinsville quickly became a busy canal port with a reputation for being a &quot;fair port&quot;.

A further boon to the area&#x27;s reputation as an industry and transportation center came with the construction of railroads in 1853. This now booming section of Perrinsville was incorporated as a village on , and eventually became the center of activity for the town of Perinton.

In the 19th century, industry moved into Fairport, including Deland Chemical (baking soda), Cobb Preserving (the predecessor to American Can), and the Trescott Company (fruit grading and packing systems). Deland Chemical later became Fairport Vinegar Works, makers of Certo brand pectin used to gel and preserve foodstuffs.

In the early 20th century, the Erie Canal was expanded and renamed the Barge Canal. (It reverted to its original name in 1992). Barge transportation rapidly declined as automobiles and trucks became popular. The town began to expand away from the canal. The Erie Canal is now used mainly for recreation.

Fairport acquired its name in the mid-19th century from a traveler on the Erie Canal who was overheard at Mallett&#x27;s Tavern referring to the village as a &quot;fair port&quot;. Local legend has it that the same visitor vociferously complained the next morning that Millstone Block Hotel had bedbugs, and he stormed out of Fairport, never to be seen again. The name, however, stuck. 

The First Baptist Church of Fairport, Wilbur House, Minerva and Daniel DeLand House, and Henry DeLand House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Fairport is in eastern Monroe County, in the northern part of the town of Perinton. It is southeast of downtown Rochester.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the village of Fairport has a total area of , of which , or 2.29%, are water. The water area is largely contained in the Erie Canal.

<text>Malay ( , ; , Jawi: ) is an Austronesian language that is an official language of Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore. Indonesian, a standardized Malay-based national variety, is the official language of Indonesia and is one of working languages in East Timor. Malay is also spoken as a regional language of ethnic Malays in Indonesia and the southern part of Thailand. Altogether, it is spoken by 290 million people (around 260 million in Indonesia alone in its own literary standard named &quot;Indonesian&quot;) across Maritime Southeast Asia.

The language is pluricentric and a macrolanguage, i.e., a group of mutually intelligible speech varieties, or dialect continuum, that have no traditional name in common, and which may be considered distinct languages by their speakers. Several varieties of it are standardized as the national language ( or ) of several nation states with various official names: in Malaysia, it is designated as either (&quot;Malaysian language&quot;) or also (&quot;Malay language&quot;); in Singapore and Brunei, it is called (&quot;Malay language&quot;) where it in the latter country refers to a formal standard variety set apart from its own vernacular dialect; in Indonesia, an autonomous normative variety called (&quot;Indonesian language&quot;) is designated the (&quot;unifying language&quot; or lingua franca) whereas the term &quot;Malay&quot; () refers to vernacular varieties of Malay indigenous to areas of Central to Southern Sumatra and West Kalimantan as the ethnic languages of Malay in Indonesia.

Classical Malay, also called Court Malay, was the literary standard of the pre-colonial Malacca and Johor Sultanates and so the language is sometimes called Malacca, Johor or Riau Malay (or various combinations of those names) to distinguish it from the various other Malayic languages. According to &quot;Ethnologue&quot; 16, several of the Malayic varieties they currently list as separate languages, including the varieties of Peninsular Malay, are so closely related to standard Malay that they may prove to be dialects. There are also several Malay trade and creole languages (e.g. Ambonese Malay) based on a lingua franca derived from Classical Malay as well as Makassar Malay, which appears to be a mixed language.

==Origin==
Malay historical linguists agree on the likelihood of the Malayic homeland being in western Borneo. A form known as Proto-Malayic was spoken in Borneo at least by 1000 BCE, it has been argued to be the ancestral language of all subsequent Malayic languages. Its ancestor, Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, a descendant of the Proto-Austronesian language, began to break up by at least 2000 BCE, possibly as a result of the southward expansion of Austronesian peoples into Maritime Southeast Asia from the island of Taiwan.
==History==

The history of the Malay language can be divided into five periods: Old Malay, the Transitional Period, the Classical Malay, Late Modern Malay and Modern Malay. Old Malay is believed to be the actual ancestor of Classical Malay.

Old Malay was influenced by Sanskrit, the classical language of India. Sanskrit loan words can be found in Old Malay vocabulary. The earliest known stone inscription in the Old Malay language was found in Sumatra, Indonesia, written in the Pallava variety of the Grantha alphabet and is dated 1 May 683. Known as the Kedukan Bukit inscription, it was discovered by the Dutchman M. Batenburg on 29 November 1920 at Kedukan Bukit, South Sumatra, on the banks of the Tatang, a tributary of the Musi River. It is a small stone of . For centuries, Srivijaya, through its expansion, economic power and military prowess, was responsible for the widespread of Old Malay throughout the Malay Archipelago. It was the working language of traders and it was used in various ports, and marketplaces in the region.

Other evidence is the Tanjung Tanah Law in post-Pallava letters. This 14th-century pre-Islamic legal text was produced in the Adityawarman era (1345–1377) of Dharmasraya, a Hindu-Buddhist kingdom that arose after the end of Srivijayan rule in Sumatra. The laws were for the Minangkabau people, who today still live in the highlands of Sumatra, Indonesia.

Terengganu Inscription Stone (Malay: ; Jawi: ) is a granite stele carrying inscription in Jawi script that was found in Terengganu, Malaysia is the earliest evidence of classical Malay inscription. The inscription, dated possibly to 702 AH (corresponds to 1303 CE), constituted the earliest evidence of Jawi writing in the Malay world of Southeast Asia, and was one of the oldest testimonies to the advent of Islam as a state religion in the region. It contains the proclamation issued by a ruler of Terengganu known as Seri Paduka Tuan, urging his subjects to extend and uphold Islam and providing 10 basic Sharia laws for their guidance.

The classical Malay language came into widespread use as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the region during the Malacca Sultanate era (1402–1511). It was the period the Malay language developed rapidly under the influence of Islamic literature. The development changed the nature of the language with massive infusion of Arabic, Sanskrit, and Tamil vocabularies, called &quot;Classical Malay&quot;. Under the Sultanate of Malacca the language evolved into a form recognisable to speakers of modern Malay. When the court moved to establish the Johor Sultanate, it continued using the classical language; it has become so associated with Dutch Riau and British Johor that it is often assumed that the Malay of Riau is close to the classical language. However, there is no closer connection between Malaccan Malay as used on Riau and the Riau vernacular. The fall of Malacca created dispersal of centres of Malay literature as many literati and scholars took refuge in various other places that were not yet in the sphere of influence of colonial powers, hence literary works were now also being created in Aceh, Java, Macassar, the Moluccas, Champa and elsewhere.

Among the oldest surviving letters written in Malay are the letters from Sultan Abu Hayat of Ternate, Maluku Islands in present-day Indonesia, dated around 1521–1522. The text is addressed to the king of Portugal, following contact with Portuguese explorer Francisco Serrão. The letters show sign of non-native usage; the Ternateans used (and still use) the unrelated Ternate language, a West Papuan language, as their first language. Malay was used solely as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; for inter-ethnic communications.

The 19th century was the period of strong Western political and commercial domination in the Malay archipelago. The colonial demarcation brought by the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty led to Dutch East India Company effectively colonising the East Indies in the south while the British Empire held several colonies and protectorates in the Malay peninsula and Borneo in the north. Both the British and the Dutch used Malay as a tool of centralisation and modernisation. They made use of each other&#x27;s scholarly publications in creating (or &quot;inventing&quot;) a standard version of Malay. The flourishing of pre-modern Malay literature in 19th century led to the rise of intellectual movement among the locals and the emergence of new community of Malay linguists.

==Classification==

Malay is a member of the Austronesian family of languages, which includes languages from Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean, with a smaller number in continental Asia. Malagasy, a geographic outlier spoken in Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, is also a member of this language family. Although these languages are not necessarily mutually intelligible to any extent, their similarities are often quite apparent. In more conservative languages like Malay, many roots have come with relatively little change from their common ancestor, Proto-Austronesian language. There are many cognates found in the languages&#x27; words for kinship, health, body parts and common animals. Numbers, especially, show remarkable similarities.

Within Austronesian, Malay is part of a cluster of numerous closely related forms of speech known as the Malayic languages, which were spread across Malaya and the Indonesian archipelago by Malay traders from Sumatra. There is disagreement as to which varieties of speech popularly called &quot;Malay&quot; should be considered dialects of this language, and which should be classified as distinct Malay languages. The vernacular of Brunei—Brunei Malay—for example, is not readily intelligible with the standard language, and the same is true with some lects on the Malay Peninsula such as Kedah Malay. However, both Brunei and Kedah are quite close.

==Writing system==

Malay is now written using the Latin script, known as &quot;Rumi&quot; in Brunei, Malaysia and Singapore or &quot;Latin&quot; in Indonesia, although an Arabic script called &quot;Arab Melayu&quot; or &quot;Jawi&quot; also exists. Latin script is official in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. Malay uses Hindu-Arabic numerals.

&quot;Rumi&quot; (Latin) and &quot;Jawi&quot; are co-official in Brunei only. Names of institutions and organisations have to use Jawi and Rumi (Latin) scripts. Jawi is used fully in schools, especially the religious school, &quot;sekolah agama&quot;, which is compulsory during the afternoon for Muslim students aged from around 6–7 up to 12–14.

Efforts are currently being undertaken to preserve Jawi in Malaysia, and students taking Malay language examinations in Malaysia have the option of answering questions using Jawi.

The Latin script, however, is the most commonly used in Brunei and Malaysia, both for official and informal purposes.

Historically, Malay has been written using various scripts. Before the introduction of Arabic script in the Malay region, Malay was written using the Pallava, Kawi and Rencong scripts; these scripts are no longer frequently used, but similar scripts such as the Cham alphabet are used by the Chams of Vietnam and Cambodia. Old Malay was written using Pallava and Kawi script, as evident from several inscription stones in the Malay region. Starting from the era of kingdom of Pasai and throughout the golden age of the Malacca Sultanate, &quot;Jawi&quot; gradually replaced these scripts as the most commonly used script in the Malay region. Starting from the 17th century, under Dutch and British influence, Jawi was gradually replaced by the Rumi script.

== Extent of use ==

Malay is spoken in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, East Timor, Singapore and southern Thailand. Indonesian is the national language in Indonesia by Article 36 of the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia, while &quot;Malay&quot; () has been recognised as the ethnic languages of Malay in Indonesia alongside Malay-based trade and creole languages and other ethnic languages. Malaysia and Singapore use a common standard Malay. Brunei, in addition to Standard Malay, uses a distinct vernacular dialect called Brunei Malay. In East Timor, Indonesian is recognised by the constitution as one of two working languages (the other being English), alongside the official languages of Tetum and Portuguese. The extent to which Malay is used in these countries varies depending on historical and cultural circumstances. Malay is the national language in Malaysia by Article 152 of the Constitution of Malaysia, and became the sole official language in Peninsular Malaysia in 1968 and in East Malaysia gradually from 1974. English continues, however, to be widely used in professional and commercial fields and in the superior courts. Other minority languages are also commonly used by the country&#x27;s large ethnic minorities. The situation in Brunei is similar to that in Malaysia. In the Philippines, Indonesian is spoken by the overseas Indonesian community concentrated in Davao City. Functional phrases are taught to members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines as well as local students.

==Phonology==

Malay, like most Austronesian languages, is not a tonal language.

===Consonants===
The consonants of Malaysian and also Indonesian are shown below. Non-native consonants that only occur in borrowed words, principally from Arabic, Dutch and English, are shown in brackets.

Orthographic note:
The sounds are represented orthographically by their symbols as above, except:

* is &#x27;z&#x27;, the same as the sound (only occurs in Arabic loanwords originally containing the sound, but the writing is not distinguished from Arabic loanwords with sound, and this sound must be learned separately by the speakers).
* is &#x27;ny&#x27;; &#x27;n&#x27; before &#x27;c&#x27; and &#x27;j&#x27;
* is &#x27;ng&#x27;
* is represented as &#x27;s&#x27;, the same as the sound (only occurs in Arabic loanwords originally containing the sound, but the writing is not distinguished from Arabic loanwords with sound, and this sound must be learned separately by the speakers). Previously (before 1972), this sound was written &#x27;th&#x27; in Standard Malay (not Indonesian)
* the glottal stop is final &#x27;k&#x27; or an apostrophe &#x27; (although some words have this glottal stop in the middle, such as &quot;rakyat&quot;)
* is &#x27;c&#x27;
* is &#x27;j&#x27;
* is &#x27;sy&#x27;
* is &#x27;kh&#x27;
* is &#x27;y&#x27;
* is &#x27;k&#x27;

Loans from Arabic:
* Phonemes which occur only in Arabic loans may be pronounced distinctly by speakers who know Arabic. Otherwise they tend to be replaced with native sounds.

===Vowels===
Malay originally had four vowels, but in many dialects today, including Standard Malay, it has six, with split into and split into . Many words are commonly pronounced variably, with either or , and relatively few words require a mid vowel .
Orthographic note: both and are written with . Orthographic are relatively rare, so the letter usually represents . There are some homographs; for example, &quot;perang&quot; is used for both &quot;war&quot; and &quot;blond&quot;. (In Indonesia, &quot;blond&quot; may be written &quot;perang&quot; or &quot;pirang&quot;.)

Some analyses regard as diphthongs. However, and can only occur in open syllables, such as &quot;cukai&quot; (&quot;excise&quot;) and &quot;pulau&quot; (&quot;island&quot;). Words with a phonetic diphthong in a closed syllable, such as &quot;baik&quot; (&quot;good&quot;) and &quot;laut&quot; (&quot;sea&quot;), are actually two syllables. An alternative analysis therefore treats the phonetic diphthongs , and as a sequence of a monophthong plus an approximant: , and respectively.

There is a rule of vowel harmony: the non-open vowels in bisyllabic words must agree in height, so &quot;hidung&quot; (&quot;nose&quot;) is allowed but *&quot;hedung&quot; is not.

Study by Uri Tadmor which was published in 2003 shows that mutation of ⟨a⟩ in final open syllable is an areal feature. Specifically, it is an areal feature of Western Austronesia. Uri Tadmor classify those types into four groups as below. 
==Grammar==
Malay is an agglutinative language, and new words are formed by three methods: attaching affixes onto a root word (affixation), formation of a compound word (composition), or repetition of words or portions of words (reduplication). Nouns and verbs may be basic roots, but frequently they are derived from other words by means of prefixes, suffixes and circumfixes.

Malay does not make use of grammatical gender, and there are only a few words that use natural gender; the same word is used for &#x27;he&#x27; and &#x27;she&#x27; which is &quot;dia&quot; or for &#x27;his&#x27; and &#x27;her&#x27; which is &quot;dia punya&quot;. There is no grammatical plural in Malay either; thus &quot;orang&quot; may mean either &#x27;person&#x27; or &#x27;people&#x27;. Verbs are not inflected for person or number, and they are not marked for tense; tense is instead denoted by time adverbs (such as &#x27;yesterday&#x27;) or by other tense indicators, such as &quot;sudah&quot; &#x27;already&#x27; and &quot;belum&quot; &#x27;not yet&#x27;. On the other hand, there is a complex system of verb affixes to render nuances of meaning and to denote voice or intentional and accidental moods.

Malay does not have a grammatical subject in the sense that English does. In intransitive clauses, the noun comes before the verb. When there is both an agent and an object, these are separated by the verb (OVA or AVO), with the difference encoded in the voice of the verb. OVA, commonly but inaccurately called &quot;passive&quot;, is the basic and most common word order.

==Vocabulary and borrowed words==


The Malay language has many words borrowed from Arabic (in particular religious terms), Sanskrit, Tamil, certain Sinitic languages, Persian (due to historical status of Malay Archipelago as a trading hub), and more recently, Portuguese, Dutch and English (in particular many scientific and technological terms).

==Varieties and related languages==

There is a group of closely related languages spoken by Malays and related peoples across Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Southern Thailand, East Timor, and the far southern parts of the Philippines. They have traditionally been classified as Malay, Para-Malay, and Aboriginal Malay, but this reflects geography and ethnicity rather than a proper linguistic classification. The Malayic languages are mutually intelligible to varying extents, though the distinction between language and dialect is unclear in many cases.

Para-Malay includes the Malayic languages of Sumatra. They are: Minangkabau, Central Malay (Bengkulu), Pekal, Talang Mamak, Musi (Palembang), Negeri Sembilan (Malaysia), and Duano’.

Aboriginal Malay are the Malayic languages spoken by the Orang Asli (Proto-Malay) in Malaya. They are Jakun, Orang Kanaq, Orang Seletar, and Temuan.

The other Malayic languages, included in neither of these groups, are associated with the expansion of the Malays across the archipelago. They include Riau-Johor Malay (Malaysian and Indonesian), Kedah Malay, Brunei Malay, Berau Malay, Bangka Malay, Jambi Malay, Kutai Malay, Terengganu Malay, Riau Malay, Loncong, Pattani Malay, Bacan Malay, and Banjarese. Menterap may belong here.

There are also several Malay-based creole languages, such as Betawi Malay, Cocos Malay, Makassar Malay, Ambonese Malay, Dili Malay, Kupang Malay, Manado Malay, Papuan Malay, Thousand Islands Malay, Larantuka Malay, Alor Malay, Balinese Malay, and Sabah Malay, which may be more or less distinct from standard (Malaccan) Malay.

Due to the early settlement of a Cape Malay community in Cape Town, who are now known as Coloureds, numerous Classical Malay words were brought into Afrikaans.

===Usages===

The extent to which Malay and related Malayan languages are used in the countries where it is spoken varies depending on historical and cultural circumstances. Malay is the national language in Malaysia by Article 152 of the Constitution of Malaysia, and became the sole official language in West Malaysia in 1968, and in East Malaysia gradually from 1974. English continues, however, to be widely used in professional and commercial fields and in the superior courts. Other minority languages are also commonly used by the country&#x27;s large ethnic minorities. The situation in Brunei is similar to that of Malaysia.

In Singapore, Malay was historically the &quot;lingua franca&quot; among people of different nationalities. Although this has largely given way to English, Malay still retains the status of national language and the national anthem, Majulah Singapura, is entirely in Malay. In addition, parade commands in the military, police and civil defence are given only in Malay.

Most residents of the five southernmost provinces of Thailand—a region that, for the most part, used to be part of an ancient Malay kingdom called Pattani—speak a dialect of Malay called Yawi (not to be confused with Jawi), which is similar to Kelantanese Malay, but the language has no official status or recognition.

Owing to earlier contact with the Philippines, Malay words—such as &quot;dalam hati&quot; (sympathy), &quot;luwalhati&quot; (glory), &quot;tengah hari&quot; (midday), &quot;sedap&quot; (delicious)—have evolved and been integrated into Tagalog and other Philippine languages.

By contrast, Indonesian has successfully become the &quot;lingua franca&quot; for its disparate islands and ethnic groups, in part because the colonial language, Dutch, is no longer commonly spoken. (In East Timor, which was governed as a province of Indonesia from 1976 to 1999, Indonesian is widely spoken and recognized under its Constitution as a &#x27;working language&#x27;.)

Besides Indonesian, which developed from the Riau Malay dialect, there are many Malay varieties spoken in Indonesia; they are divided into western and eastern groups. Western Malay dialects are predominantly spoken in Sumatra and Borneo, which itself is divided into Bornean and Sumatran Malay; some of the most widely spoken Sumatran Malay dialects are Riau Malay, Langkat, Palembang Malay and Jambi Malay. Minangkabau, Kerinci and Bengkulu are believed to be Sumatran Malay descendants. Meanwhile, the Jakarta dialect (known as Betawi) also belongs to the western Malay group.

The eastern varieties, classified either as dialects or creoles, are spoken in the eastern part of the Malay or Nusantara archipelago and include Makassar Malay, Manado Malay, Ambonese Malay, North Moluccan Malay, Kupang Malay, Dili Malay, and Papuan Malay.
The differences among both groups are quite observable. For example, the word &quot;kita&quot; means &#x27;we, us&#x27; in western, but means &#x27;I, me&#x27; in Manado, whereas &#x27;we, us&quot; in Manado is &quot;torang&quot; and Ambon &quot;katong&quot; (originally abbreviated from Malay &quot;kita orang&quot; &#x27;we people&#x27;). Another difference is the lack of possessive pronouns (and suffixes) in eastern dialects. Manado uses the verb &quot;pe&quot; and Ambon &quot;pu&quot; (from Malay &quot;punya&quot; &#x27;to have&#x27;) to mark possession. So &#x27;my name&#x27; and &#x27;our house&quot; are translated in western Malay as &quot;namaku&quot; and &quot;rumah kita&quot; but &quot;kita pe nama&quot; and &quot;torang pe rumah&quot; in Manado and &quot;beta pu nama&quot;, &quot;katong pu rumah&quot; in Ambon dialect.

The pronunciation may vary in western dialects, especially the pronunciation of words ending in the vowel &#x27;a&#x27;. For example, in some parts of Malaysia and in Singapore, &quot;kita&quot; (inclusive &#x27;we, us, our&#x27;) is pronounced as , in Kelantan and Southern Thailand as , in Riau as , in Palembang as , in Betawi and Perak as and in Kedah and Perlis as /kitɑ/.

Batavian and eastern dialects are sometimes regarded as Malay creole, because the speakers are not ethnically Malay.

==Examples==

All Malay speakers should be able to understand either of the translations below, which differ mostly in their choice of wording. The words for &#x27;article&#x27;, &quot;pasal&quot; and &quot;perkara&quot;, and for &#x27;declaration&#x27;, &quot;pernyataan&quot; and &quot;perisytiharan&quot;, are specific to the Indonesian and Malaysian standards, respectively, but otherwise all the words are found in both (and even those words may be found with slightly different meanings).

<doc id="126632" wikidata="Q3098591" url="?curid=126632" title="Henrietta, New York">
<text>Henrietta is a town in Monroe County, New York, United States, and a suburb of the city of Rochester. The population of Henrietta was 47,096 as of the 2020 census, up from 42,581 in 2010. Henrietta is home to the Rochester Institute of Technology and to one of the largest retail shopping districts in Monroe County.

==History==

The first residents of the Henrietta area were Native Americans. Although no evidence of Native American villages has been found in Henrietta, numerous artifacts and skeletons have been unearthed by farmers and archeologists over the past 200 years. With the end of the American Revolution, several resident tribes that had sided with the British were forced to leave Upstate New York. As a result, land became available for European settlers in the Finger Lakes and Genesee Valley regions.

The town of Henrietta was named after Henrietta Laura Pulteney, Countess of Bath in Great Britain. Her father Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet, a major British investor from the Pulteney Association, owned the land that became the town. Henrietta Pulteney never visited the town. Pulteney eventually sold his holdings, which then passed through the hands of several American investors.

The first European settlers in Henrietta were Major Ezekiel Scott and his wife Catherine, who purchased in 1790. Most of the original arriving settlers were English. Two villages, East and West Henrietta, arose in the area, both part of the town of Pittsford. In 1818, a dispute about the recording of deeds prompted residents of the two villages to secede from Pittsford and form the town of Henrietta.

With the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, Henrietta farmers gained access to the New York City market for their crops and the town prospered. In 1826, the Monroe Academy opened in Henrietta, becoming the first incorporated school in Monroe County.

After the end of World War II, the population of Henrietta rose from 3,000 to approximately 14,000 in ten years as suburban development grew around the city of Rochester. The building of the New York State Thruway through Henrietta in the early 1950s made the town more desirable for commercial development. In 1968, the Rochester Institute of Technology moved from Rochester to a new campus in Henrietta. That same year, the National Technical Institute for the Deaf opened in Henrietta.

In the 1980s, with the completion of Interstate 390 and the building of the Marketplace Mall, Henrietta was developed into one of the major retail shopping destinations in Monroe County.

<text>Mendon is a town in Monroe County, New York, United States. It has been ranked as the most affluent suburb of the city of Rochester. As of the 2020 census, the population was 9,095. The town is on the southern border of the county.

== History ==
The earliest known inhabitants of the land where the town of Mendon is located were the Seneca people of the Iroquois Confederacy. Totiakton, the native settlement in present-day Mendon, was home to about 4,000 people. In 1687, the town was destroyed by the Marquis de Denonville, the governor of New France, during his expedition against the Seneca. Shortly after the destruction, the surviving natives moved elsewhere. The rest of the Seneca suffered a similar fate when, in 1779, Major General John Sullivan was ordered by George Washington to wage war against Loyalists and four nations of the Iroquois Confederacy who had sided with the British in the Revolutionary War. The Sullivan Expedition pushed the tribes to the British-controlled Niagara Frontier, the western edge of New York.

Following the Revolutionary War, in 1788 Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham bought of land in what is now western New York from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Included in the Phelps and Gorham Purchase was the land that would later become the town of Mendon (known as Township Number 11, Range 5 in the purchase&#x27;s 1788 survey).

For a short period, the area that is now Mendon was ostensibly part of New York&#x27;s Montgomery County until January 27, 1789, when Ontario County was formed. From 1789 to 1812, the area was within the town of Bloomfield. On May 26, 1812, the town of Mendon separated from Bloomfield, holding its first town meeting and elections on April 6, 1813. In 1821, Mendon was annexed by Monroe County when the county was created.

According to a local historian, Mendon most likely got its name from Caleb Taft, an early settler, who came from Mendon, Massachusetts.

On June 7, 1825, the Marquis de Lafayette was escorted from the village of Rochesterville to the hamlet of Mendon where he was met by representatives from the village of Canandaigua during his tour of all 24 states of the union.

The first train travelled through Mendon on January 1, 1853, when a railroad was built between Canandaigua and Batavia. The &quot;Peanut Line&quot;, as it would later be referred to after it was acquired by the New York Central Railroad, was opened and had a station in the village of Honeoye Falls. In 1891, the Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR) completed its mainline from Manchester to Buffalo, which travelled right through the heart of Mendon. At the height of the LVRR, there were three stations located in the town; one in the hamlet of Mendon, the second at Rochester Junction (a major hub where track split off the mainline to downtown Rochester), and the third in the village of Honeoye Falls.

In 1954, the New York State Thruway was built on the northern border of Mendon, which became Interstate 90 when the Interstate Highway System was created in 1957.

The Adsit Cobblestone Farmhouse, Cole Cobblestone Farmhouse, Gates-Livermore Cobblestone Farmhouse, Mendon Cobblestone Academy, Mendon Presbyterian Church, Miller–Horton–Barben Farm, Sheldon Cobblestone House, Stewart Cobblestone Farmhouse, and Whitcomb Cobblestone Farmhouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Mendon Ponds Park, the largest in Monroe County, is a property in the northwest part of the town, containing woodlands, ponds, wetlands. The park became a National Natural Landmark in November 1967 for its unique glacial features.

In the southern part of the town, hills and a meandering creek were used to create the Mendon Golf Club. The first nine holes were designed by Peter Craig in 1961, and the back nine, added in 1967, were designed by Joe DeMino. The 2016 NCAA Division III men&#x27;s golf championship was played at the club and was hosted by St. John Fisher College.

==Government==
In New York state, towns are organized with an elective legislative body known as a town board. Town government is run by the town board, members of which act as the executive, administrative and legislative body of the town. A town board, as a group, is the executive head of the town, there being no true executive in town government comparable with a mayor of a city or village, or with the governor of the state. While the supervisor presides at town board meetings and may be assigned certain powers of administration and supervision, the additional duties and responsibilities of the supervisor are only those which result from that position&#x27;s statutory role as town treasurer.
Prior to 1964, authority for town board action had to be in specific state legislation or in the constitution. Since that date, however, towns have had constitutional home rule powers. Towns are able to enact local laws regarding subjects within the realm of &quot;property, affairs and government&quot; of the town, provided the laws are not inconsistent with the constitution or a law of general statewide applicability enacted by the State Legislature. In addition, towns may adopt local laws concerning a number of other subjects specified in the constitution and the Municipal Home Rule Law, so long as they are not inconsistent with general law applicable to all towns, and provided there is no statutory restriction against such local law. Since 1974, with certain exceptions, towns may even supersede some provisions of town law regardless of their general applicability. Besides the above-described legislative powers, town law and other state statutes contain authority for town boards to act in a variety of specific areas. These have been amended over the years such that town boards have the authority to supply almost every public function or service that any other municipality may provide, subject to the functions specific rules and procedures.
In Mendon, the town board consists of a supervisor and four town board members (often referred to in statutes as councilpersons). Town board members, as elected officials of the town, must be &quot;electors&quot; of the town at the time of election and throughout their terms of office. An elector is someone who could register as a voter in the town, whether they actually have or not. Registration has three components: residency, age and citizenship. Residency equates to the legal term &quot;domicile&quot; and is defined in law. The age qualification is 18 and United States citizenship is also required. Mendon Town Board members have a term of four years. The Mendon town supervisor has a term of two years. Town elections are held in odd numbered years, with new terms starting the following January 1.
The town board, as the executive body of the town, acts as a unit and must function as a body. An individual Board member may not unilaterally act on behalf of the town board. No town board member has more or less authority than any other board member. Therefore, no board member can legally act independently for the others or outside the board. No single member of the town board can act for or commit the noard as a body to any particular program or policy.
The town board may, by resolution, delegate to the supervisor the powers and duties of administration and supervision of town special improvement district functions to be performed on behalf of the town board. The purpose of this provision is to allow the town to function between town board meetings. This delegation does not allow the town board to abdicate to the supervisor or surrender to him or her the board&#x27;s basic statutory responsibilities.

The paper of record for the town of Mendon is the Mendon-Honeoye Falls-Lima Sentinel.

==Emergency response==
Access to emergency services is obtained by dialing 911, which connects the caller to the city of Rochester&#x27;s emergency communications department center). The Monroe County sheriff&#x27;s department provides primary law enforcement for the town.

The Mendon Volunteer Fire Department provides fire protection, rescue, and non-transport emergency medical services for the town. The Honeoye Falls Volunteer Fire Department provides additional services in the areas in and surrounding the village of Honeoye Falls.

The Honeoye Falls Mendon Volunteer Ambulance provides both basic and advanced life support with trained emergency medical technicians.

==Education==
Mendon is served primarily by the Honeoye Falls-Lima Central School District, while the northernmost portion of the town is part of the Pittsford Central School District.

<doc id="126638" wikidata="Q3709152" url="?curid=126638" title="Penfield, New York">
<text>Penfield is a town in Monroe County, New York, United States. The population was 39,438 at the 2020 census, up from 36,242 in 2010.

The town was incorporated in 1810 by the proprietor Daniel Penfield, a veteran of the Revolutionary War who purchased the town lands in 1795 and moved to the area in 1809. Penfield is a suburb of Rochester. The town sits along Irondequoit Creek, which in the town&#x27;s early days fueled its economy with mills.

==History==
The lands that now constitute the town of Penfield were part of the hunting grounds of the Seneca people, a member of the Haudenosaunee tribes. There is no evidence of Seneca settlements within Penfield, but the town does include the place now called &quot;Indian Landing&quot;. From this landing on the shores of Irondequoit Bay, trails and water routes went throughout the region and beyond. This included a water route with only two portages leading from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.

Following the American Revolution, the lands that became Penfield were included in the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. After passing through several hands, Townships 13 and 14 of Range IV of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase were acquired by Daniel Penfield in several transactions during the course of 1795. Penfield&#x27;s house still stands at 1784 Penfield Road.

All settlements in the region that were to the east of the Genesee River became part of the town of Northfield in 1796. Those to the west of the river were organized into Northampton in 1797. As the population rapidly grew both settlements divided. Northfield first became Boyle, from which Penfield split in 1810.

The town of Penfield was established in 1810, and the first town meeting was held on April 2, 1811. The town initially consisted of Townships 13 and 14 of Range IV. A portion of the southwest corner went to the town of Brighton when it was established in 1814, and Township 14 became the town of Webster in 1840. Modern Penfield is, with minor differences, Township 13 of Range IV of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase.

The original Penfield town hall was built in 1895 and was deemed a Penfield landmark in 1981. The building is located at 2131 Five Mile Line Road. In the 1950s the downstairs of the town hall was the library, and when the location of the Penfield town hall was changed, the library took over the entire building. The library has since been moved to Baird Road Community Center. In 1966 the Penfield Town hall was moved to its current location at 3100 Atlantic Avenue. The original building of the town hall is currently a maternity clothing store.

The Horace and Grace Bush House, Daisy Flour Mill, Dayton&#x27;s Corners School, Hipp-Kennedy House, Mud House, Penfield Road Historic District, Stephen Phelps House, Samuel Rich House, and Harvey Whalen House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Penfield is in eastern Monroe County and is bordered to the north by the town of Webster, to the south by the towns of Perinton and Pittsford, and to the west by the towns of Irondequoit and Brighton. The town of East Rochester is less than one mile south of the Penfield border. To the east is the town of Walworth in Wayne County.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town of Penfield has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.68%, are water. Irondequoit Creek crosses the southwest corner of the town and then forms part of the town&#x27;s western border, emptying into Irondequoit Bay, part of which occupies the northwest corner of the town.

Nearly two million years ago, Penfield&#x27;s topography was formed by melting glaciers. The same forces that created the Finger Lakes helped develop interesting terrain in and around Ellison Park. These glacial ice melt carvings left fertile lands which today are used in farming (and from the late 20th century to the present, housing developments). The soil is rich for farming certain types of apples, cherries, plums, peaches, and pears.

Penfield includes a number of parks with a variety of terrain, water features, lodges and shelters, open spaces, and athletic facilities.

* Channing H. Philbrick Park (formerly Linear Park)
* Ellison Park

<text>Perinton (originally Perrinton (in federal censuses) and sometimes Perrington when still part of Ontario County) is a town in Monroe County, New York, United States. The population was 47,479 at the 2020 census.

The village of Fairport is within the town on the Erie Canal. 

==History==

In 1788, Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham purchased 2.6 million acres (11,000 km2) of land in the wilderness of Western New York. William Walker of Canandaigua purchased of the land and hired his brother Caleb and his cousin Glover Perrin (1762–1830) to survey and divide the land into 66 equal lots. The area was known as Township 12, Range 4, in the governmental unit of Northfield.

In 1793, Glover Perrin, his family, and his six siblings and their families, became the first permanent white settlers in the area. They settled in the flat and well-watered areas, specifically in the hamlet of Egypt (along the current Route 31) and Perinton Center (the intersection of Turk Hill and Ayrault roads). Early commercial ventures included mills, blacksmith shops, taverns, and inns.

By the late 1820s, the village of Fairport, located within the town on the Erie Canal, was becoming a booming canal town. Fairport, however, was not incorporated as a village until 1867.

From the 1850s to the 1950s, Perinton&#x27;s history was primarily Fairport&#x27;s history. The village was an active canal port and also a booming industrial town, echoing a trend that was occurring nationwide. As a result of the availability of cheap and easy transportation, which by the 1850s included the railroad as well as the canal, companies such as the DeLand Chemical Company, the Cobb Preserving Company, Taylor&#x27;s Oil of Life, and eventually the American Can Company, grew and thrived. Services, including a fire department, a public library, street lighting, and parks, enhanced the life of the town and village. Residential areas, with homes built in a variety of architectural styles, were built around the bustling village center.

The town of Perinton, outside of Fairport, remained essentially rural until the 1950s. Today farms still exist in Perinton, but are surrounded by suburban subdivisions, office and industrial parks, and an impressive number of parks and open spaces. The village of Fairport still maintains the ambience of a canal town and capitalizes on the recreational aspects of that canal.

Most residents of the town of Perinton reside within both the Fairport Central School District and the Fairport postal district; due to this it is common for Perinton residents to describe their place of residence as &quot;Fairport&quot; even if they live outside of the village.

The town of Perinton was named one of the nation&#x27;s 100 best places to live in 2008 by RelocateAmerica.com.

Richardson&#x27;s Canal House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

In the 18th century, the lands of present-day Riga were part of the &quot;Mill Seat Tract&quot; deeded by Native Americans to Phelps and Gorham. Soon thereafter, Robert Morris of Philadelphia acquired the land and sold it to the estate of Sir William Pulteney in England.

The Riga area was originally part of Ontario County, set up by the State Legislature in 1789. It later became part of Genesee County. The first organized town between the Genesee River and Lake Erie was Northampton. In 1802, Northampton was divided into Leicester, Batavia, Southampton, Northampton, and East and West Pulteney - after Sir William Pulteney. In 1808 East and West Pulteney became East and West Riga, and in 1809 the town of Riga was formed.

<text>Rochester is a city in the U.S. state of New York and the county seat of Monroe County. It is the fourth-most populous city and 10th most-populated municipality in New York, with a population of 211,328 at the 2020 census. The city forms the core of the larger Rochester metropolitan area in Western New York, with a population of just over 1 million residents. Throughout its history, Rochester has acquired several nicknames based on local industries; it has been known as &quot;the Flour City&quot; and &quot;the Flower City&quot; for its dual role in flour production and floriculture, and as the &quot;Imaging Capital of the World&quot; for its association with film, optics, and photography.

The city was one of the United States&#x27; first boomtowns, initially due to the fertile Genesee River valley which gave rise to numerous flour mills, and then as a manufacturing center, which spurred further rapid population growth. Rochester has also played a key part in US history as a hub for social and political movements, especially abolitionism, and the women&#x27;s rights movement.

Rochester is the birthplace and/or home of many notable companies including Eastman Kodak, Xerox, Bausch &amp; Lomb, Wegmans, Constellation Brands, Gannett, Paychex, and Western Union, and the region became a global center for science, technology, and research and development. This has been aided by the presence of several internationally renowned universities, notably the University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology, and their research programs; these schools, along with many other smaller colleges, have played an increasingly large role in its economy. The city experienced significant population decline due to deindustrialization in the late 20th century, although less severely than its Rust Belt peers. The Rochester metropolitan area is the third-largest regional economy in New York, after New York City and Buffalo-Niagara Falls.

Rochester is also known for its culture; in particular, the Eastman School of Music, one of the most prestigious conservatories in the world, and the Rochester International Jazz Festival anchor a vibrant music industry. It is the site of several museums such as The Strong National Museum of Play and the George Eastman Museum, which houses the oldest photography collection in the world.

==History==
===Eighteenth century===
The Seneca tribe of the Iroquois Confederacy lived around Rochester prior to the American Revolution, and used the area as a hunting ground. Allied with the British, the Seneca were forced to cede or sell most of their land in New York after the war. The area now occupied by Rochester was ceded in the Phelps and Gorham Purchase of 1788. As a reward for their loyalty to the British crown, the Iroquois were given a large land grant on the Grand River in Canada.

=== Nineteenth century ===
Rochester was founded shortly after by a wave of English-Puritan-descended immigrants from New England, who were looking for new agricultural land. They were the dominant cultural group in Rochester for over a century. On November 8, 1803, three men from Hagerstown, Maryland, purchased a 100-acre (40-ha) tract from the Pulteney Estate along the Genesee River: Major Charles Carroll, Colonel William Fitzhugh Jr, and Colonel Nathaniel Rochester, the namesake of the city. They chose the site because its three cataracts on the Genesee offered great potential for water power. Beginning in 1811, and with a population of 15, the three founders surveyed the land and laid out streets and tracts. In 1817, the Brown brothers and other landowners joined their lands with the Hundred Acre Tract to form the village of Rochesterville. This name was unpopular, and in 1822 it was shortened to Rochester.

By 1821, Rochesterville became the seat of Monroe County. In 1823, the Erie Canal aqueduct over the Genesee River was completed, connecting the city to the Hudson River to the east. New commerce from the canal turned the village into America&#x27;s first boomtown. By 1830, Rochester&#x27;s population had grown to 9,200, and in 1834, it was rechartered as a city. Rochester was first known as &quot;the Young Lion of the West&quot;, and then as the &quot;Flour City&quot;. By 1838, it was the largest flour-producing city in the United States. A series of religious revivals occurred in the as part of the Second Great Awakening, including a particularly notable revival led by Charles Grandison Finney which inspired local social reform movements.

During the mid-19th century, as the center of the wheat-processing industry moved west with population and agriculture, the city became home to an expanding nursery business, giving rise to the city&#x27;s second nickname, the Flower City. Nurseries ringed the city, the most famous of which was started in 1840 by immigrants George Ellwanger from Germany and Patrick Barry from Ireland. Shoemaking also became a major local industry as the city began to industrialize.

In 1847, Frederick Douglass founded &quot;The North Star&quot;, an abolitionist newspaper, in Rochester. A former slave and an antislavery speaker and writer, he gained a circulation of over 4,000 subscribers in the United States, Europe, and the Caribbean. Douglass lived in Rochester until his home was destroyed in a fire in 1872, and a historical marker was erected at the site on South Avenue. Many other prominent abolitionists operated in the area and operated on the Underground Railroad, such as Thomas James and Austin Steward.

Around the same time, the nearby Finger Lakes region was the birthplace of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. A critical suffragettes&#x27; convention was held in 1848 in nearby Seneca Falls, and Rochester was the home of Susan B. Anthony along with other notable Suffragettes such as Abigail Bush and Amy Post. The city itself played host to the Rochester Women&#x27;s Rights Convention of 1848. The Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, in 1920, which guaranteed the right of women to vote, was known as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment because of her work toward its passage, which she did not live to see. Anthony&#x27;s home is a National Historic Landmark known as the National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House.

===Twentieth century===

Rochester saw an expansion of new industries in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Irish immigrant James Cunningham founded the carriagemaker James Cunningham, Son and Company. James Cunningham and Sons later founded the Cunningham Car Company, a pioneer automobile maker. German immigrants John Jacob Bausch and Henry Lomb launched Bausch &amp; Lomb in 1861 and inventor and entrepreneur George Eastman founded Eastman Kodak in 1892. Xerox was founded in Rochester in 1906 as the Haloid Company. In the early 20th century, Rochester became a center of the garment industry, particularly men&#x27;s fashions. It was the base of Bond Clothing Stores, Fashion Park Clothes, Hickey Freeman, and Stein-Bloch and Co. The Erie Canal was rerouted south of Rochester by 1918 to allow widening as part of the Barge Canal&#x27;s construction. The short-lived Rochester subway was constructed in the abandoned canal bed and operated from 1927 to 1956.

The dawn of the 20th century in Rochester saw rapid growth, driven by waves of immigrants arriving from Germany, Italy, Poland, and elsewhere. The city also grew in area, annexing suburban neighborhoods from the surrounding towns to arrive at its present borders. The population reached 62,386 in 1870, 162,608 in 1900, and 295,750 in 1920. By 1950, the population had reached a high of 332,488. The surge in new arrivals, along with increased industrialization, resulted in the city becoming a hotbed of labor activism. From the 1920s and continuing into the post-war era Rochester grew into a power center for newly formed industrial unions. It was one of the very few American cities where the labor movement was powerful enough to mount a successful general strike when in 1946 an estimated 50,000 workers across multiple sectors walked off in support of hundreds of city employees who had been fired for attempting to unionize.

During World War II, Rochester factories produced a variety of goods for the war effort, including fuel tanker ships, optical equipment, and radio proximity fuses, amounting to of military orders. Following the war, the city began engaging in urban renewal projects to revitalize downtown, including the construction of Midtown Plaza and freeways like the Inner Loop, and the demolition of the Front Street neighborhood. By the 1970s, the city experienced highway revolts against new projects, and in the 2010s, the city began filling in the Inner Loop to restore older neighborhoods.

In 1950, the Census Bureau reported Rochester&#x27;s population as 97.6% White and 2.3% Black. Rochester&#x27;s black population tripled to more than 25,000 during the 1950s. Casually employed by the city&#x27;s major industries, most African Americans in the city held low-pay and low-skill jobs, and lived in substandard housing. Discontent exploded in the three-day 1964 Rochester race riot, which resulted in five deaths, 350 injuries, nearly a thousand arrests, and 204 stores looted or damaged. In the wake of the riot, the Rochester Area Churches, together with black civil rights leaders, invited Saul Alinsky of the Industrial Areas Foundation to help the community organize. With the Reverend Franklin Florence, they established FIGHT (Freedom, Integration, God, Honor, Today), which successfully brought pressure to bear on Eastman Kodak to help open up employment and city governance.

With industrial restructuring in the later 20th century, Rochester&#x27;s manufacturing workforce shrank. Kodak, long the city&#x27;s largest employer, conducted massive layoffs prior to a 2012 bankruptcy. By 2022, the city&#x27;s population had declined to 209,352 (although the metropolitan area was considerably larger) with 45.1% recorded as White and 38.4% as Black or African American. Although the total population declined, new arrivals continued to move to the city and change its demographic profile. Thousands of Puerto Ricans moved to the city after World War II, and the city became a major destination for refugees in the 21st century.

==Geography==

Rochester is located in Upstate New York, on the southern shore of Lake Ontario. The Genesee River bisects the city. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and are covered by water (3.42%). Rochester borders the towns of Irondequoit to the north and northeast, Brighton to the southeast and south, Chili to the southwest, Gates to the west, and Greece to the northwest.

Rochester&#x27;s landscape was formed by the ice sheets during the Pleistocene epoch. The retreating ice sheets reached a standstill at what is now the southern border of the city, melting at the same rate as they were advancing, depositing sediment along the southern edge of the ice mass. This created a line of hills, including (from west to east) Mt. Hope, the hills of Highland Park, Pinnacle Hill, and Cobb&#x27;s Hill. Because the sediment of these hills was deposited into a proglacial lake, they are stratified and classified as a &quot;kame delta&quot;. A brief retreat and readvance of the ice sheet onto the delta deposited unstratified material there, creating a rare hybrid structure called &quot;kame moraine&quot;. The ice sheets also created Lake Ontario, the Genesee River with its waterfalls and gorges, Irondequoit Bay, Sodus Bay, Braddock Bay, Mendon Ponds, numerous local streams and ponds, the Ridge, and the nearby Finger Lakes.

Water to the city is sourced from Hemlock Lake, Canadice Lake, and Lake Ontario.

===Neighborhoods===
Celebrate City Living, a partnership program between the city government and Rochester Coalition for Neighborhood Living, defines 35 neighborhoods in Rochester. Among these are the 14621 Community, 19th Ward, Beechwood, Browncroft, Charlotte, Cobbs Hill, Corn Hill, downtown Rochester, Dutchtown, Edgerton, EMMA (East Main, Mustard &amp; Atlantic Avenue), High Falls, Highland Park, Homestead Heights, JOSANA (Jay-Orchard Street Area), Lincoln Park, Lyell-Otis, Maplewood, Marketview Heights, Mayor&#x27;s Heights, Monroe Village, NOTA (Neighborhood of the Arts), North Winton Village, Northland-Lyceum, Park Avenue, Plymouth-Exchange, South Wedge, Susan B. Anthony, Swillburg, Upper Falls, Upper Monroe, and Upper Mount Hope.
====19th Ward====
The 19th Ward is a southwest neighborhood bordered by Genesee Street, West Avenue, and the Erie Canal, and is across the river from the University of Rochester. The neighborhood is one of the largest in Rochester. Now known by its slogan &quot;Urban by Choice&quot;, in the early 19th century, the area was known as Castle Town, after Castle Inn, a tavern run by Colonel Isaac Castle. By the early 1820s, however, the area was overshadowed by developments in the north that would become downtown Rochester. Due to a tumultuous bend in the Genesee, the area was home to skilled boatsmen who assisted boats traveling north to Rochester and the area was consequently known during this time as &quot;The Rapids&quot;. In the 1890s, as Rochester expanded, the area rapidly urbanized. By 1930, it was a booming residential area for doctors, lawyers, and other skilled workers. Homes in the originally upper-class neighborhood typically have gumwood trim, leaded glass, fireplaces, hardwood floors, and open porches. In the 1960s, property values fell as the population of Rochester did, the area experienced white flight accelerated by school busing, blockbusting, and race riots downtown, and crime increased, with violence, drug use, and neglected property further diminishing property values. In recent years, neighborhood revitalization has come from the &quot;Brooks Landing&quot; development along the Genesee River. Gentrification has occurred in the 19th Ward and adjacent Plymouth-Exchange area from the conversion of housing stock to student housing for the University of Rochester. Located in the 19th Ward are the Arvine Heights Historic District, Chili–West Historic District, Inglewood and Thurston Historic District, and Sibley–Elmdorf Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

====Browncroft====
The Browncroft neighborhood is built on the former nursery grounds of the Brown Brothers nursery, between the town of Brighton and Winton Road. Many Tudor and Colonial houses are contained within, and the business district situated on Winton Road has a mix of restaurants and shops. The Browncroft Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

====Charlotte====

Charlotte is a lakefront community in Rochester bordering Lake Ontario. It is home to Ontario Beach Park, commonly known as Charlotte Beach, which is a popular summer destination for Rochesterians. A new terminal was built in 2004 for the Rochester-to-Toronto ferry service and was later sold after the ferry ceased operations in 2005. The Port of Rochester terminal still exists, but multiple attempts by the city to make additions have failed since 2016.

==== Corn Hill ====
Corn Hill is located in the city&#x27;s old Third Ward, and best known today for the annual Corn Hill arts festival. Many of the city&#x27;s wealthiest residents lived in the neighborhood during the 19th century, but they relocated to the East End and suburbs after the turn of the century. The neighborhood experienced decline, and much of the Third Ward was demolished for the construction of I-490 in the 1960s. Revival began in the late 1960s, as several of the Victorian homes in the neighborhood were restored by the Genesee Landmarks Foundation. In 1969 the Corn Hill arts festival was held and became an annual feature. The Third Ward Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

====Edgerton====
The Edgerton neighborhood is in the city&#x27;s northwest quadrant, along Lake Avenue. Historically an Italian-American neighborhood, the area around Lyell Avenue has been a target for the formation of a designated Little Italy neighborhood, although few Italian Americans live there today. The neighborhood is known for struggling with a high crime rate. Residents have pursued a number of strategies to improve the neighborhood in recent years, including the construction of housing for the homeless. The neighborhood features Edgerton Park, which was once home to most of the city&#x27;s professional sports teams.

==== Maplewood ====

Maplewood is located in the northwest quadrant, centered around Lake Avenue and Maplewood Park. Eastman Business Park is located on its north edge. The neighborhood once contained both mansions for the wealthy and worker housing for nearby factories like Kodak&#x27;s. Many of the neighborhood&#x27;s old mansions have been converted to multi-family housing. Due to its diverse architectural heritage, the Maplewood Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

====Marketview Heights====
The Marketview Heights neighborhood is northeast of downtown Rochester, running east from Union Street just north of Atlantic Ave. It is best known as the location of the Public Market, which first opened in 1905 and offers a variety of groceries and other goods from farms and shops from surrounding areas, primarily on the weekends. In the late twentieth century, the neighborhood experienced a severe decline, and roughly half of residents lived below the poverty line in 2000. Public investment was made in the neighborhood after 2008 to implement a number of community proposals. A second round of proposals are being explored currently for the planned removal of the Inner Loop in the southern end of the neighborhood.

====Park Avenue====
Park Avenue is centered on the eponymous street southeast of downtown. It originally functioned as a service street with businesses that catered to wealthy residents who lived on nearby East Avenue. Between 1894 and 1975, it was also home to Park Avenue Hospital. Today, the neighborhood is one of the most desirable in the city, highly valued for its walkability and density of bars, clubs, and restaurants. The city&#x27;s annual pride parade is hosted in the neighborhood. The Park Avenue Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020.

====South Wedge====
The South Wedge is a wedge-shaped neighborhood centered on South Avenue between the Genesee River and Interstate 490. It began as the home of several families involved in trades on the Erie Canal. In the 1840s, the Ellwanger and Barry nursery was built on South Avenue, introducing greenery to the neighborhood and drawing tourists. Frederick Douglass lived in a house in the neighborhood. The area fell on hard times after World War II, when residents moved to the suburbs and several homes and businesses were abandoned. The South Wedge Planning Committee was established in 1973 to revitalize the neighborhood. Today, the neighborhood is a hub of small businesses. The South Wedge Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013, and the Gregory Tract Historic District was listed in 2022.

===Climate===
Rochester lies in the humid continental climate zone (Köppen: &quot;Dfa&quot;) and has four distinct seasons.

Winters are cold (temperatures drop to on 4.2 nights annually). Like much of the eastern Great Lakes, Rochester is very cloudy and overcast in winter. Rochester normally receives heavy snow in winter (primarily lake effect snow resulting from its location on the southern shores of Lake Ontario), ranking among the snowiest large cities on earth and occasionally setting records for annual snowfall among large US metros. The 30-year annual average snowfall is just above . Spring sees plentiful rain with the rising temperatures, and occasional late snowstorms depending on the year. Summers are warm and sunny; there are occasional short periods of high heat and humidity but in general, Rochester is set apart from most of the continental US by comparatively cool, comfortable summers (ranking among the top five coolest summers among large metros alongside San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Oregon, and neighboring Buffalo). Autumn features brilliant foliage colors, cooling temperatures and occasionally an excess of rain depending on the year, though precipitation is generally plentiful and dispersed fairly evenly throughout the year.
==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, the population of Rochester was 211,328. Like most Rust Belt cities, the city has experienced a sustained population decline over the last 60 years. In 2020, for the first time in 200 years, Rochester dropped to the fourth most populous city in the state behind Yonkers. However, in 2020, an increase in the city&#x27;s population was reported for the first time since the 1950 Census.

===2020 census===
As of the 2020 Census, 38.0% of Rochester residents were non-Hispanic Black, 33.0% were non-Hispanic White, 19.8% were Hispanic/Latino, 3.9% were Asian, 0.2% were Native American or Pacific Islander, and 5.1% were mixed or other.

In 2020, there were 91,500 households, of which 18.8% were married couples living together, 9.9% were unmarried co-habitating couples, 42.3% had a female householder with no partner present, and 29.0% had a male householder with no partner present. Of all households, 41.3% were made up of individuals, 25.3% had children under 18 living with them, and 9.2% had someone living alone 65 or older. 33.1% of housing units were owner-occupied, and 66.9% were rented. The age distribution was 18.8% under 18, 15.4% from 18 to 24, 30.8% from 25 to 44, 22.6% from 45 to 64, and 12.4% who were 65 or older. The median age was 32.9. For every 100 females, there were 93.6 males.

According to 2020 American Community Survey estimates, The median income for a city household was $37,395, and for a family was $43,873. Males had a median income of $30,379, versus $28,260 for females. The per capita income for the city was $24,916. About 25.5% of families and 30.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 48.2% of those under age 18 and 17.3% of those age 65 or over.

Although losing population since 1950, over the course of the past 70 years Rochester has become a major center for immigration, particularly for arrivals from Eastern and Southeastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Caribbean. Rochester had the highest percentage of Puerto Ricans of any major city in the United States in 2013, one of the four largest Turkish American communities, one of the largest Jamaican American communities in any major U.S. city and a large concentration of Polish Americans along with nearby Buffalo, New York. Rochester&#x27;s Bhutanese and Nepalese communities are among the largest (top 3) in the United States, concentrated primarily in Jones Square and Edgerton with growth fueled by recently arrived migrants and refugees. In addition, Rochester was ranked number 9 in the nation for the largest Italian population in the United States in 2018.

Rochester has been reported to have the largest &quot;per capita&quot; deaf population in the United States by the New York Times because it is home to the National Technical Institute for the Deaf. A 2012 report by the NTID concluded 3.7% of the Rochester metropolitan area is deaf or hard-of-hearing, compared to a national rate of 3.5%. Rochester has the largest deaf and hard-of-hearing population &quot;per capita&quot; when analyzing the working-age population, but may not have the largest &quot;per capita&quot; deaf population among all cities, due to deafness being much more prevalent in the elderly.

==Economy==

Like many Rust Belt cities, Rochester was traditionally a manufacturing center, home to companies such as Bausch &amp; Lomb, Kodak, and Xerox. In the 21st century, deindustrialization has occurred. Xerox and Kodak each laid off thousands of workers in the 1990s and 2000s, causing the University of Rochester to become the city&#x27;s top employer in 2005, a title it holds today. Bausch &amp; Lomb moved to Bridgewater, New Jersey, in 2014. The Gannett newspaper company and Western Union were founded in Rochester by Frank Gannett and Hiram Sibley, respectively, but have since moved to other cities. Today, the city&#x27;s top employers are its educational and medical institutions. After the University of Rochester, major employers in these fields include Rochester Regional Health, the Rochester Institute of Technology, and Carestream Health. In recent years, a high technology industry has grown in Rochester, fostered in part by collaborations between private startup enterprises and the local higher learning institutions. Other organizations such as High Tech Rochester provide local startups with mentorship, office space, and other resources. Like its legacy manufacturers, Rochester&#x27;s modern technological focus is on imaging and optical science among the industry and universities. The Institute of Optics of the University of Rochester and the Rochester Institute of Technology have popular imaging programs, and a research hub for photonics has operated in the city since 2015 following federal and state investment. Rochester is also home to the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 beverage company Constellation Brands and the &quot;Fortune&quot; 1000 company Paychex (Fortune #681) and the supermarket chain Wegmans. The median single-family house price was $247,000 in the third quarter of 2023 in greater Rochester, an increase of 10.3% from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors.

==Arts and culture==
The city of Rochester is home to numerous cultural institutions. These include the Garth Fagan Dance, the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra, the Rochester City Ballet, Rochester Contemporary Art Center, the Rochester Broadway Theater League, Hochstein School of Music &amp; Dance, the Auditorium Theater, and numerous arts organizations. Geva Theatre Center is the city&#x27;s largest professional theater. The East End Theater is on East Main Street in the theater district. The Eastman School of Music, one of the top musical institutes in the nation, and its auditorium are also within the East End neighborhood. The Eastman Theatre is host to the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra and other musical/drama events.The Rochester Association of Performing Arts is a non-profit organization that provides educational theater classes to the community.

===Architecture===
Several churches are among Rochester&#x27;s architectural features, including Asbury First United Methodist Church, St. Joseph&#x27;s Church and Rectory, and the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, which was designed by Louis Kahn and described by Paul Goldberger as one of &quot;the most significant works of religious architecture of the century&quot;. Significant Art Deco buildings include the Cinema Theater and Times Square Building, noted for its 42&#x27; tall &quot;Wings of Progress&quot; sculpture. The Midtown Plaza, the nation&#x27;s first downtown shopping mall, first opened in 1962, and remains partially standing today.

===Museums===
Museums in the Rochester area include the Genesee Country Village and Museum, George Eastman Museum, Memorial Art Gallery, Rochester Museum and Science Center, Strasenburgh Planetarium, Susan B. Anthony House, New York Museum of Transportation, Rochester &amp; Genesee Valley Railroad Museum, and The Strong National Museum of Play. In 2023, plans were announced for a museum dedicated to the life of Frederick Douglass in the city.

===Festivals===
Rochester hosts a number of cultural festivals every year. The Lilac Festival at Highland Park is attended by hundreds of thousands annually. Established after an 1898 gathering, it features the largest collection of lilac varieties in North America, a parade, and dozens of musical acts and food vendors. The Rochester International Jazz Festival was established in 2002 and is one of the largest jazz festivals in the United States. It takes place in late June at dozens of clubs, concert halls and free outdoor stages throughout Downtown Rochester, regularly drawing over 200,000 visitors. Other notable annual festivals in Rochester include the Rochester International Film Festival in June, the Corn Hill Arts Festival in July, and the Rochester Fringe Festival in September.

===Cuisine===
One food product Rochester calls its own is the &quot;white hot&quot;, a variant of the hot dog or smoked bratwurst made by the local Zweigle&#x27;s company and other companies. Another local specialty is the Garbage Plate, a trademark of Nick Tahou Hots that traditionally includes macaroni salad, home fries, and two hot dogs or cheeseburgers topped with mustard, onions, and their famous meat hot sauce. Many area restaurants feature copies or variations with the word &quot;plate&quot; commonly used as a general term. Chicken Francese was first popularized by Rochester&#x27;s Italian American community.

The Genesee Brewing Company is headquartered in Rochester, where it holds an annual December tradition of assembling a tower of beer kegs in the shape of a Christmas tree. Other local franchises include Abbott&#x27;s Frozen Custard, Bill Gray&#x27;s, DiBella&#x27;s, and Tom Wahl&#x27;s. Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, which originated in Syracuse, also operates its second franchise downtown in the former Lehigh Valley Railroad station on the Genesee River. The Ragú brand of pasta sauce used to be produced in Rochester. Some of the original facility still exists and produces products for other labels (including Newman&#x27;s Own) as Private Label Foods. Rochester was also the original home of French&#x27;s Mustard, whose address was 1 Mustard Street.

==Sports==
===Professional sports===
Rochester has several professional sports teams:

The Rochester Royals (now the Sacramento Kings) were a professional basketball team in Rochester from 1945 to 1957 with roots as an amateur team dating back to 1923. They won the NBA title in 1951, defeating the New York Knicks in 7 games. Rochester and its surrounding area also has a rich golf history and has hosted numerous professional tournaments on its local golf courses, most recently the 2023 PGA Championship.

===Collegiate===
NCAA Division I teams include the RIT men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey teams, and the University of Rochester men&#x27;s squash team, which has ranked top 5 in Division I.

==Parks and recreation==

Notable cemeteries include the Victorian-era Mount Hope Cemetery, Holy Sepulchre and Riverside Cemetery. Mount Hope became a popular picnicking destination during the late nineteenth century, and the city began to develop public parks. Rochester&#x27;s park system was initially designed by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted in the 1890s. Olmsted intended to preserve natural landscapes for the city residents to enjoy. The system included four major parks: Genesee Valley Park, Highland Park, Maplewood Park, and Seneca Park, the last of which is today home to the Seneca Park Zoo.

The park system was expanded in the early twentieth century with Cobb&#x27;s Hill Park and Durand Eastman Park in 1908, Edgerton Park in 1911, and Ontario Beach Park in the early 1920s. The Park Commission also constructed new facilities in all parks, filling them with playgrounds, pavilions, and sports facilities. Modern additions to the park system include Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Park, Turning Point Park, and Tryon Park, which are located on former industrial and urban sites, in contrast to the early parks. Most of the city&#x27;s parks lie on the Genesee River and can be accessed by the Genesee Riverway Trail, which runs for the river&#x27;s entire length through the city. Current city facilities include 12 full-time recreation centers, 48 playgrounds, two artificial ice rinks, 74 softball/baseball fields, 42 tennis courts, four soccer fields, and 45 outdoor basketball courts.

==Government==
Rochester is governed by a mayor serving as chief executive of city government and a city council consisting of four district members and five at-large members. Rochester has had a Strong mayor-council form of government since the approval of its current charter in a referendum in 1984. Administrative officers are appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the city council. All city legislation is proposed and passed by the council, and subject to a veto by the mayor, unless a majority of two-thirds approved it. The current mayor is Malik Evans, serving since January 1, 2022.

Upon the city&#x27;s charter in 1834, the mayor had few powers and most power was vested in the city council, which was composed of alderman representing individual wards. The charter was frequently modified during the 19th century to expand or reduce the mayor&#x27;s powers, until an 1898 act by the New York State Legislature centralized all appointments under the mayor. The city abolished the mayor&#x27;s office and adopted a city manager system in a 1925 referendum, after which the mayor became a minor position and the city manager assumed executive authority, with both being chosen by the members of the city council. A 1984 referendum restored the Strong mayor system. William A. Johnson, the city&#x27;s first African American mayor, served from 1994 to 2005. Lovely Warren, the city&#x27;s first female mayor, served from 2014 to 2021.

=== Federal representation ===
The city is covered by New York&#x27;s 25th congressional district currently represented by Democrat Joe Morelle of Irondequoit, Monroe County, in Congress. From 1987 until 2018, the city was represented by longtime Democrat Louise M. Slaughter of Fairport, Monroe County, in Congress.

=== State representation ===
After redistricting based on the 2020 United States census, the city was split between two state senate districts:
After redistricting based on the 2020 census, the city was split between three state assembly districts:
=== County representation ===

Rochester is represented by districts 7, 16, and 21–29 in the Monroe County legislature (a 29-seat body with legislators elected to two-year terms). Rochester is also under the jurisdiction of the county executive (currently Democrat Adam Bello) along with the rest of Monroe County. The District Attorney is also elected at the county level along with several other offices (such as Sheriff and Clerk) which in part govern the city.

=== Courts ===
Rochester is part of the 7th Judicial District of the New York Supreme Court and the 4th Department of the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division.

====Rochester City Court====
Rochester City Court is part of the New York State Unified Court System and consists of ten full-time judges, each of whom is elected to a 10-year term. Each judge must be a city resident and must have been an attorney in New York for at least five years. Judges have a mandatory retirement age of 70. Vacancies on the court are filled by the mayor, and judges so appointed must run for a full term at the next general election.

In New York State, the 61 city courts outside of New York City handle the arraignment of felonies, try misdemeanors and lesser offenses, and try civil lawsuits involving claims of up to $15,000. Rochester City Court also hears small claims matters up to $5,000. Rules of practice and procedure within all city courts are prescribed by the Uniform City Court Act. Rochester City Court, like all city courts, follows the individual assignment system (&quot;IAS&quot;). This means that each case is assigned to a judge when the case is first initiated, and, with a few exceptions, stays under the supervision of that particular judge until the case is resolved.

Created in 1876, the Court was initially named the &quot;Municipal Court of the City of Rochester&quot; and had two judges. Originally, city courts throughout the state were self-regulating, and prescribed their own rules of procedure and bounds of jurisdiction. Rochester City Court was governed by the Rochester City Court Act, which was a part of the Charter of the City of Rochester. In 1935, Judge Jacob Gitelman introduced weekend sentencing. He was the first judge in New York State to do so. In 1964, the New York State Constitution was amended to require uniform jurisdiction, practice, and procedure for the city courts, to be regulated by the state legislature. The court&#x27;s first African-American judge, Reuben K. Davis, was appointed to the city court bench in March 1967.

In the 1980s, the court heard cases involving the prosecution of the &quot;Topfree Seven,&quot; women who intentionally bared their chests once a year in order to protest the criminalization of female nudity. Judge Herman J. Walz ruled that the women could not be prosecuted under New York&#x27;s public nudity statute because their act of going topless in order to protest the law was imbued with First Amendment protections. The decision was later affirmed by the New York Court of Appeals. By 1995, Rochester City Court had eight judges. A ninth was added in 2001. The Court was brought to its current complement of ten judges in 2014.

===Colleges and universities===

Rochester and the surrounding region host a high concentration of colleges and universities, which drive much of the economic growth in the five-county area. The University of Rochester is the only large research institution primarily within the city limits, although Monroe Community College and SUNY Brockport operate campuses downtown. The Highland Park neighborhood was home to Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School (part of whose facility is leased by Ithaca College&#x27;s Department of Physical Therapy) and an office maintained by the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.

The University of Rochester is the metropolitan area&#x27;s oldest and most prominent institution of higher learning, and one of the country&#x27;s top research centers. It includes a nursing school, the Simon School of Business, and the Eastman School of Music. It was founded and endowed by George Eastman in his years as a philanthropist. He also contributed greatly to the University of Rochester from wealth based on the success of Eastman Kodak.

Five institutions began operations in the city and later moved to Rochester&#x27;s inner-ring suburbs: the Empire State College Rochester Learning Center, Monroe Community College, Rochester Institute of Technology, St. Bernard&#x27;s School of Theology and Ministry and Nazareth University. Rochester was the host of the Barleywood Female University, a short-lived women&#x27;s college from 1852 to 1853. The Lutheran seminary that became Wagner College was established in the city in 1883 and remained for some 35 years before moving to Staten Island.

===Libraries===
The Rochester Public Library is headquartered at the Central Library of Rochester &amp; Monroe County, which is located in the Rundel Memorial Library building and the adjacent Bausch &amp; Lomb Public Library Building in downtown Rochester. The city is part of the larger Monroe County Library System. Library cards are freely available to residents of Monroe County and valid at the eleven branch libraries in the city and other branches in the county.

==Media==

The &quot;Democrat and Chronicle,&quot; a Gannett newspaper&quot;,&quot; is Rochester&#x27;s main daily newspaper. Other local publications exist which cater to special interests, such as the &quot;Rochester Business Journal&quot; and the &quot;Minority Reporter&quot;. Former publications serving the city include &quot;Insider&quot; magazine, the &quot;Rochester Post Express&quot;, the &quot;Rochester Evening Journal&quot;, and the &quot;Times-Union&quot;.

Rochester is also served by several local television and radio stations, with WROC-TV as the oldest television station serving the Rochester metro area. The WXXI Public Broadcasting Council is a non-profit organization in Rochester which provides public television and community radio programs. WXXI owns or operates several radio stations, the television station WXXI-TV, the alternative weekly publication &quot;City&quot; Magazine, and the Little Theater.

Several movies have been filmed at least in part in Rochester, including &quot;The Amazing Spiderman 2&quot; (2014) and &quot;The Tomorrow Man&quot; (2019).

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Maritime====

There is marine freight service at the Port of Rochester on Lake Ontario, which is connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The Erie Canal intersects the Genesee River on the south side of the city.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, a number of passenger ferries operated on Lake Ontario between the Port of Rochester and Canada. Service ended in 1950 when the &quot;Ontario I&quot; and &quot;Ontario II&quot; ended their route between Rochester and Cobourg. A new ferry, the Spirit of Ontario I, operated between Rochester and Toronto from June 17, 2004, to December 12, 2005. The ferry suffered from numerous issues, including two separate pier collisions that damaged it. The initial operator, Canadian American Transportation Systems (CATS), went bankrupt by the end of the 2004 season. The city of Rochester then purchased the ferry and signed a contract with Bay Ferries Great Lakes to resume operations in 2005. The resumption of service was delayed until summer, causing the ferry to continue to operate at a loss. In 2006, the operation was shut down and the ferry was sold.

====Air====
Rochester is served by the Frederick Douglass Greater Rochester International Airport (GRIA). Scheduled air service is provided by American, Allegiant, Delta, Frontier, JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit, and United.

FedEx founder Fred Smith has stated in several articles that Xerox&#x27;s development of the copier, and its need to quickly get parts to customers, was one of the economic issues that led him to pioneer the overnight delivery business in 1971. Because Xerox manufactured its copiers in Rochester, the city was one of the original 25 cities FedEx served on its first night of operations on April 17, 1973.

In 2016, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a $63.4 million project to renovate the GRIA. The renovations include a large canopy extending over both main entrances, solar panels, a rainwater collection system, and modern communication and security enhancements. All construction was completed by October 2018.

====Rails and mass transit====
Local bus service in Rochester and its county suburbs is provided by the Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority (RGRTA) via its Regional Transit Service (RTS) subsidiary. RTS also provides suburban service outside the immediate Rochester area and runs smaller transportation systems in outlying counties, such as WATS (Wayne Area Transportation System). All RTS routes are based out of the RTS Transit Center on Mortimer Street. Rochester has intercity and transcontinental bus service via Greyhound and Trailways.

Rail service to Rochester is provided by the Louise M. Slaughter Rochester Station, served by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Empire Service&quot; between New York City and Niagara Falls, the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; between New York City and Toronto, and the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; between New York City/Boston and Chicago. Prior to 1965, Rochester had a smaller station reminiscent of New York City&#x27;s &quot;Grand Central Terminal&quot;. It was among Claude Fayette Bragdon&#x27;s best works in Rochester. The current station is modeled after Bragdon&#x27;s work and named in honor of former longtime congresswoman Louise Slaughter.

Rochester used to be a major stop on several railroad lines. The New York Central Railroad provided service to Chicago and Buffalo to the west and Albany and New York City to the east and southeast. The Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway (absorbed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad) served Buffalo and Pittsburgh until 1955. A rail route to Salamanca in southern New York State afforded connections in Salamanca to southwestern and southeastern New York State. The last long-distance train was the &quot;Northern Express&quot;/&quot;Southern Express,&quot; operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad on the Genesee Valley Canal Railroad, that went to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania via Canandaigua, Elmira and Williamsport; service ended in 1971. Also serving Rochester were the Erie Railroad and Lehigh Valley Railroad.
From 1927 to 1956, Rochester had a light rail underground transit system called the Rochester subway, which was first operated by New York State Railways and later by the Rochester Transit Corporation. Rochester was the smallest city in the world to have such a system. After the subway was shut down in 1956, the eastern half of the subway past Court Street became the Eastern Expressway, and the western end of the open cut was filled in 1976. The tunnel was last used for freight service by Gannett Company to bring paper to the printing presses for the Democrat and Chronicle in 1997. In the years since, the tunnel has become a hub for graffiti artists. Several proposals have been made to completely fill the remaining tunnel, redevelop the underground space, or convert the bridge to a pedestrian crossing. Portions have been filled in at the western end and the eastern end for new above-ground development. The Broad Street aqueduct, which contains part of the tunnel, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

====Major highways and roads====

Three exits off the New York State Thruway (I-90) serve Rochester. Rochester&#x27;s expressway system, conceived in the 1950s, was designed as two concentric circles with feeder expressways from the west, south and east. The system allows for quick travel within the metropolitan area and a lack of the traffic gridlock typically found in cities of comparable size; in part this is because the system was designed to accommodate rapid travel between the suburbs and downtown, and also because it was built when the city&#x27;s population was over 330,000, whereas today it is a full third less.

The Outer Loop circles just outside the city limits while the former Inner Loop once circled around the immediate downtown area within the city (the easternmost sector was closed in 2015). From the west are Lake Ontario State Parkway, NY 531 and I-490; I-390 feeds from the south; and NY 104, NY 441, and I-490 approach from the east.

In the early 1970s, the Genesee Expressway Task Force, City leaders, and the New York State Department of Transportation studied the feasibility of connecting the outer and inner Loops with a new southern expressway. The proposed route extended north from the I-390 and I-590 interchange in Brighton, cutting through Rochester&#x27;s Swillburg neighborhood. In 1972, consultants Berger Lehman Associates recommended a new &#x27;Busway&#x27;, an expressway with dedicated bus lanes, similar to Bus Rapid Transit. The expressway extension was never built. In 2016, the City of Rochester launched the Pace Car Program.

 I-390 (Genesee Expressway)
*I-390 runs south–north, crossing I-90 (exit 46) and routing north through Rochester&#x27;s western suburbs. Its northern end is at I-490, however, it continues north as NY 390 until it merges into the Lake Ontario State Parkway. South of I-90, I-390 runs to Avoca, where it meets with US 15 and the Southern Tier Expressway, I-86.
 I-490 (Western/Eastern Expressway)
*I-490 runs west–east through Rochester, starting at Le Roy and ending in Victor. It interchanges with the two other Interstates in Rochester: I-390 at the western city limit and I-590 at the eastern limit, as well as connecting at both ends with the Thruway, I-90 (exits 47 and 45). In July 2007, a new bridge over the Genesee River was completed and named the Frederick Douglass–Susan B. Anthony Memorial Bridge.
 I-590
*I-590 runs south–north through Rochester&#x27;s eastern suburbs. Its southern end is at I-390, while the northern terminus is at I-490; the highway continues north to the shore of Lake Ontario as NY 590.
*In decreasing usage is the term &quot;Can of Worms&quot;, referring to the previously dangerous at-grade intersection of I-490 and expressway NY 590 on the eastern edge of the Rochester city limits, bordering the suburb of Brighton. In the 1980s, a multimillion-dollar project created a system of overpasses and ramps that reduced the danger but resulted in the loss of certain exits.

 NY 104 (Irondequoit-Wayne County Expressway, West Ridge Road)
*NY 104 – Just east of the NY 590 interchange, NY 104 becomes the Irondequoit-Wayne County Expressway and crosses the Irondequoit Bay Bridge. On the other side of the Bay Bridge, in the town of Webster, NY 104 has exits before returning to an at-grade highway at Basket Road.
 NY 390
*NY 390 is an extension of Interstate 390 from the I-390/I-490 interchange in Gates. The northern terminus is at the Lake Ontario State Parkway in Greece, less than a mile from the Lake Ontario shoreline.
 NY 590
*NY 590 is a limited-access extension of Interstate 590 that runs from an interchange between Interstate 490 and I-590 on the Brighton/Rochester border. The northern terminus is at Culver Road in Irondequoit, near Sea Breeze (the western shore of Irondequoit Bay at Lake Ontario).
 Inner Loop
*The Inner Loop Runs from I-490 to Main Street on the north end and from 490 to Monroe Avenue at the south end. Formerly a loop, the eastern end was demolished and replaced with a surface road between 2014 and 2017. Unsigned reference NY 940T begins and ends at I-490, and the rest of the Loop is part of I-490 between exits 13 and 15, including the Frederick Douglass–Susan B. Anthony Memorial Bridge. This expressway is commonly used to define the borders of Downtown Rochester.

 Lake Ontario State Parkway
*Lake Ontario State Parkway travels from Lakeside Beach State Park in Carlton, Orleans County. The eastern end is at Lake Avenue in the city of Rochester in Monroe County.

===Public safety===
Fire protection and EMS services are provided by the Rochester Fire Department. The department employs 509 personnel and operates thirteen engines, six trucks, and heavy rescue from fifteen fire stations. In FY 2021–22, the department responded to 38,876 incidents. The current fire chief is Stefano Napolitano.

Law enforcement services are provided by the Rochester Police Department. The current chief of police is David Smith. Independent oversight of the department is provided by the Police Accountability Board, established in 2019 to investigate and discipline officers for misconduct. In 2023, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that the board could not enforce disciplinary actions on any officers in the department, as it would violate the contract between the city and police union.

In 2019, Rochester had 1,540 reported violent crimes. That same year, Rochester had 7,142 property crime incidents. These included 33 murders, 429 robberies, 976 aggravated assaults, 1,269 burglaries, 5,222 larceny thefts, 102 forcible rapes, 651 auto thefts, and 83 acts of arson.

On November 12, 2021, Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren declared a state of emergency due to a rising violent crime rate in the city, which produced the highest number of homicides of any year on record. Additional law enforcement assistance was requested from, and granted by, the state government. On July 21, 2022, Rochester Mayor Malik Evans declared another state of emergency due to ongoing gun violence.

===Healthcare===
Most healthcare services in the Rochester area are provided by University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) and Rochester Regional Health (RRH). Major hospitals in the Rochester area include:
*Highland Hospital, a URMC facility with 261 beds. Highland is a level 1 perinatal center and a primary stroke center. 
*Rochester General Hospital, a RRH facility with 528 beds. Rochester General is a comprehensive stroke center and level 2 perinatal center. 
*Rochester Psychiatric Center, a psychiatric hospital operated by the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene. The hospital&#x27;s campus contains the abandoned Terrence Building.
*Strong Memorial Hospital, a URMC facility with 886 beds. Strong is home to the Golisano Children&#x27;s Hospital for pediatric care, and is an AIDS center, burn center, comprehensive Stroke center, level I trauma center for both pediatric and adult care, and regional perinatal center. 
*Unity Hospital, a RRH facility with 311 beds. Unity is a regional perinatal center and primary stroke center.

In 2023, The Guardian reported that Rochester was becoming a desirable community for transgender individuals due to its network of gender-affirming care providers, such as Trillium Health.

<text>Wheatland is a town in Monroe County, New York, United States. The population was 4,897 at the 2020 census. The town is home to Genesee Country Village and Museum.

== History ==
The first settlers arrived circa 1789. The town was established on February 23, 1821, as Inverness, from the town of Caledonia. On April 3, 1821, the state legislature changed the Inverness&#x27; name to Wheatland, allegedly at the behest of John Garbutt, a former Englishman markedly devoid of Scottish tendencies.

In those days, the growing of wheat and the manufacture of flour were the county&#x27;s primary economic activity, and the Wheatland area figured prominently in this trade. The US Census of 1850 notes that the counties of Monroe and Livingston led the entire United States in wheat production.

As the vast agricultural expanses of the American Midwest opened up, the local wheat industry went into decline, beginning in the decade prior to the Civil War. This breakdown was exacerbated by severe adverse weather in the latter 1850s.

The Romanta T. Miller House and Oatka Cemetery were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

== Geography==

The town of Wheatland is located in the southwest part of Monroe County.

<text>Florida is a town south of the Mohawk River in Montgomery County, New York, United States. The population was 2,696 in the 2010 United States Census. The town was named after the state of Florida. It is located in the eastern end of Montgomery County and is south of the City of Amsterdam, which it borders.

== History ==
The first recorded contact by Europeans with local Mohawk, who had occupied the area for centuries, was the 1642 visit of Jesuit missionaries to the village &quot;Tiononderoge&quot; (in one of its variations). After failing to Christianize the Mohawk, forces from French Canada twice attacked the village in 1667 and 1693 during rising conflict with the people in the valley.

The Dutch, followed by the English, established trading relationships with the Mohawk from their bases in Albany and Schenectady. On a trip to London to visit Queen Anne in 1710, arranged by the Albany mayor Peter Schuyler, the Four Mohawk Kings asked for help in defense against the French, and for Anglican missionaries to offset French Catholic influence. (Numerous Catholic Mohawk had moved to the St. Lawrence River valley, where they settled in &quot;Kahnawake&quot; south of Montreal.)

The Crown authorized the construction of Fort Hunter near Tionondega in 1711; its fortified area included a wooden Anglican chapel, known as Queen Anne&#x27;s chapel. The Crown also encouraged the sending of two Anglican missionaries. Some traders and other Europeans began to settle near the fort as well.

Later, William Johnson arrived as a young immigrant from Ireland to begin his illustrious colonial career, first as an overseer of property in the town. Learning the Mohawk language and ways, he was appointed British agent to the Iroquois in New York, and established strong relationships with them. The Crown later made him a baronet for his contributions, and he was appointed British Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the northern colonies.

Due to the influence of Johnson and their long trading relationship with the British, the Mohawk and three other Iroquois nations allied with them during the American Revolution. A log meeting house church was built by James Dempster, a Methodist minister who had arrived in America with Francis Asbury, at Warrensbush, probably in 1778. With the British defeat, the United States forced the Mohawk and other allied Iroquois nations to cede nearly all their territory in New York. They resettled in Canada on land granted by the British Crown.

The town was founded by European Americans in 1793 on the anniversary of the discovery of Florida by Juan Ponce de León. The Towns of Florida and Charleston divided the old &quot;Town of Mohawk,&quot; ending its existence. A new Town of Mohawk was later created in a different part of the county.

The completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 eased transportation through the Mohawk Valley, connecting it to both the Great Lakes and the Hudson River and New York City markets. This greatly increased economic development in villages and cities along the canal.

In 1880, the &quot;Village of Port Jackson&quot; in the town was annexed to form part of the City of Amsterdam. Port Jackson had been an important port on the Erie Canal and a ferry station connecting the south side of the Mohawk River to the City of Amsterdam.

The village of Fonda developed near the site of the former Mohawk village of &quot;Caughnawaga&quot;, also known as &quot;Kanatsiohareke&quot;. Here the Mohawk had cultivated corn in the floodplain on the north side of the Mohawk River.

In the late 17th-century, Kateri Tekakwitha resettled here. She was a Mohawk girl who had converted to Catholicism and became renowned for her piety. She lived here with relatives after her parents died in a smallpox epidemic. She had survived it but was marked by scars. The village has a national Catholic shrine devoted to her; she is the first Native American saint. After French attacked the village in the late 17th century, Kateri and many other Catholic Mohawk moved to the Jesuit mission village of Kahnawake, established on the south side of the St. Lawrence River, opposite Montreal in Quebec, or New France.

European settlers, mostly German and English, officially organized the present-day village in 1751 at the former site of Kanatsiohareke. The settlement was later named for Douw Fonda, a Dutch-American settler who was scalped in a Mohawk raid during the Revolutionary War. His family were ancestors of the American actors Henry Fonda, Jane Fonda and Peter Fonda. Henry Fonda wrote about them in his 1981 autobiography, as follows:

:Early records show the family ensconced in northern Italy in the 16th century where they fought on the side of the Reformation, fled to Holland, intermarried with Dutch burghers&#x27; daughters, picked up the first names of the Low Countries, but retained the Italianate &quot;Fonda&quot;. Before Pieter Stuyvesant surrendered Nieuw Amsterdam to the English the Fondas, instead of settling in Manhattan, canoed up the Hudson River to the Indian village of Caughnawaga. Within a few generations, the Mohawks and the Iroquois were butchered or fled and the town became known to mapmakers as Fonda, New York.

==Nineteenth century to present==
After the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, Fonda thrived with the growth in trade and traffic that accompanied it. The canal provided transportation and commercial links to communities around the Great Lakes. Fonda became a center of cheesemaking, which was part of the regional dairy industry. The area was devoted to agriculture. As the county seat, it also did well with the arrival of the railroad in 1835, which increased cross-state transportation and shipping of goods. The village was incorporated in 1850.

In the mid to late-20th century, NASCAR held four races at the local Fonda speedway (in 1955, 1966, 1967 and 1968) as part of the Fonda 200. In 1973 the Caughnawaga Indian Village Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is the only Mohawk village in the country to have been fully excavated in archeological studies. The Walter Butler Homestead was listed on the NRHP in 1976.

== Kanatsiohareke==
In 1993 Tom Porter (Mohawk) re-established the first Mohawk community in the valley since 1783; he bought land in the Fonda area to cultivate corn and other agricultural produce. Other Mohawk joined him at this historic village site, naming their community &quot;Kanatsiohareke&quot;. This is the first land the Mohawk have held in the valley since being forced out in 1783 after the Revolution, when Great Britain ceded its former territories in the colonies to the United States. The name &quot;Kanatsiohareke&quot; means “The Place of the Clean Pot,” referring to a ten-foot-wide and ten-foot-deep pothole in the creek bed caused by rock scouring.

==Geography==
Fonda is located at (42.954342, -74.375424).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and (11.48%) is water.

Fonda is on the northern bank of the Mohawk River, opposite the Village of Fultonville.

New York State Route 5, New York State Route 30A, and New York State Route 334 all serve Fonda, with NY 334 having its southern terminus at NY 5 at the western end. Amtrak&#x27;s Empire Corridor passes through the village, though it has no station here. Travelers have to go to Troy to get the train.

<text>Fort Johnson (formerly known as Akin) is a hamlet and former village in Montgomery County, New York, United States located on the north side of the Mohawk River in the town of Amsterdam. The population was 490 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
Around 1710, early Palatine Germans began trying to settle here. Most were working in an English camp along the Hudson to pay back their passage by ship from London. In 1716, the Mohawk sold a portion of the land to Philip Groat (it is now in the eastern part of the Town of Amsterdam). This part of New York was Mohawk territory for centuries before European colonization. In 1739, William Johnson, an influential Anglo-Irish colonist who had previously lived closer to Amsterdam, purchased land including the site of the village. He established a mill in 1744. The original name of the settlement was &quot;Mount Johnson.&quot;

The community was the original seat of power of William Johnson before he moved on to found the City of Johnstown further west. He rose to become the British Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the northern colonies and was highly influential because of his strong relationships with the Iroquois, especially the Mohawk. His former home here is preserved as Old Fort Johnson. Johnson had Molly Brant, a Mohawk woman, as his longtime .

The Village of Fort Johnson was officially incorporated in 1909. However, in November 2022, due to a lack of interest in participation in the government, villagers voted to dissolve the village effective December 31, 2023.

<doc id="126653" wikidata="Q3452871" url="?curid=126653" title="Fort Plain, New York">
<text>Fort Plain is a village in Montgomery County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census, the village population was 2,322. The village is named after a fort built during the American Revolution at the junction of the Mohawk River and its tributary Otsquago Creek.

The village of Fort Plain is at the border of the Towns of Minden and Canajoharie and is west of Amsterdam.

Because of its small size and the close connections with neighboring communities, some former residents who now live in more populous regions use &quot;Fort Plain&quot; to refer collectively to the village of Fort Plain and the surrounding villages of Nelliston, and Palatine Bridge.

==History==

The village is in a region where the Mohawk had four major villages along the Mohawk River in the 17th century. They historically had occupied territory west of the Hudson River and extending up to the St. Lawrence River and south to the Delaware Water Gap, but their main villages were located close to the Mohawk River. Tionondogue, also called Tionnontogen, was located approximately north-west of Fort Plain. It was said to be the largest, and is sometimes listed as the principal town of the Mohawks. Due to losses from a smallpox epidemic in 1634, the Mohawk reduced their villages to three. By the early 18th century they had two major villages.

In 1739, the governor of New York built a stone house here for the use of his sons. Other early settlers included Palatine Germans, whom the Mohawk had permitted to settle in exchange for gaining help with their defenses in 1712 from Queen Anne of England. Anne&#x27;s government had supported immigration of the Protestant Germans as religious refugees and paid for their passage, for which they exchanged work in New York in camps along the Hudson River. As the Mohawk requested, Queen Anne ordered the construction of Fort Hunter in 1711 near Tionondoraga; that village was also known by Europeans as the &quot;Lower Castle.

The village of Fort Plain developed at the foot of the hill where the fort once stood. The Revolutionary War fort was constructed in 1776; a blockhouse was garrisoned here throughout the war. While many of the village&#x27;s men were fighting elsewhere, the women, dressed as men, manned the fort and fought off Indian attacks. The village developed around Otsquago Creek, which has its confluence with the Mohawk River.

Fort Plain became an incorporated village in 1832. The opening of the Erie Canal was an economic boom, stimulating the village to become a center of manufacturing during the nineteenth century. It produced textiles from cotton from the Deep South and furniture. Textile mills in upstate New York depended on processing southern cotton; these products made up a major part of exports from New York City in the antebellum years.
Fort Plain was the site of the 19th-century Fort Plain Seminary, which ran into hard times and whose building was acquired and used by the Clinton Liberal Institute, before being destroyed by fire in 1900.

Fort Plain is the birthplace of Bud Fowler, the first black professional baseball player. Fowler appeared in an exhibition game with a team from Lynn, Iowa in 1878, 68 years before Jackie Robinson played in a professional baseball game in the major leagues.

Numerous Amish have migrated to New York from Pennsylvania since the late 20th century, seeking affordable farm land. Many have settled in Fort Plain. Montgomery County has one of the largest populations of Amish in the country.

The Fort Plain Conservation Area, Fort Plain Historic District, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

On June 28, 2013, there was extensive flooding on Otsquago Creek, tearing up its streambed and damaging houses up the creek to Stark. More than 100 houses were damaged or destroyed in Fort Plain, where 4 inches of rain fell. Bridges over the creek were destroyed. Ten miles upstream, Stark received 7 inches of rain, which entered the creek and washed its bed away. The state quickly started the extensive work needed to repair the stream bed, nearby roadways and other infrastructure. Tons of rocks were laid down to stabilize the banks.

<text>Fultonville is a village in Montgomery County, New York, United States. The village is named after Robert Fulton, inventor of the steamboat.

The Village of Fultonville is on the south bank of the Mohawk River in the Town of Glen. It is west of Amsterdam.

In 2019, the area of the village that had been developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Fultonville Historic District in recognition of its well-preserved architecture from its original settlement, the era centering around the development of the Erie Canal, and afterwards.

==History==
The area was located near to the site of the Mohawk village of Andagaron during the middle of the seventeenth century, which was located about a mile to the west.
The first white settlement on the site was made around 1750 by John Evart Van Epps, and was called &quot;Van Epps Swamp&quot; due to the swampland by the river. During the American Revolution, the homes that were located here were burned.
Fultonville was founded around 1824 in anticipation of the opening of the Erie Canal and was incorporated as a village on August 9, 1848.

The West Shore Railroad, which was later absorbed into the New York Central system, erected a station in the village in 1889.

John Henry Starin was born in August 1825 in Sammonsville on the north side of the Mohawk, when the Erie Canal was in its infancy. His father, Myndert, had a tavern along the river and his grandfather, John, was a farmer who had served in the military during the American Revolution. The family was successful and had some money, but Starin would become one of the richest men in America as president of the Starin City River &amp; Harbor Transportation Co. and as director of the North River Bank in New York City and the Fultonville National Bank.

<text>Minden is a town in Montgomery County, New York, United States. The population was 4,297 at the 2010 census. The town is located at the western edge of the county and south of the Mohawk River, which forms its northern border. It has possessed a post office from 1802 to 1903.

== History ==

This area was first settled by Europeans around 1748. It was probably named after Minden, in Germany. Among the early European settlers in the 18th century were Palatine Germans; these Protestants had come to New York as refugees from religious warfare. Their passage was paid by Queen Anne&#x27;s government in exchange for their work at camps along the Hudson River, producing naval stores for England.

During the American Revolution, rebel colonists constructed a small fort in 1778 at Fort Plain village. In 1780, the village was attacked by Tories and allied natives. They burned and sacked the community, but were not able to overcome the defenders at the fort.

Following the war, the town of Minden was formed in 1798 from the Town of Canajoharie. It was part of a rural area that was important for agriculture and dairy farming.

In 1985, a former farm in Minden was found to be the site of a cocaine processing lab set up at a former dairy farm by the Cali cartel based in Colombia. The drug lab was shut down following a state police and federal investigation of an explosion at the site, and the United States Marshals Service took control of the property.

&quot;The 3.24 acre parcel, situated about 5 miles south of the city of Little Falls, once was the location of a farmhouse, garage, in-ground pool, stable building and dairy barn, parts of which were contaminated when toxic chemicals used to refine cocaine were dumped on the property between 1985 and 1987.&quot; The buildings were razed and removed, and the site had remediation done over a period of several years following the investigation. Toxic chemicals had been dumped on the property during the drug processing period. An estimated $15 million worth of cocaine was processed at the site. Eleven Colombian nationals were arrested and prosecuted in connection with this investigation; they were convicted and received sentences of 10 to 25 years. By 2011 the site was safe for other uses.

<text>Mohawk is a town in Montgomery County, New York, United States. The population was 3,844 at the 2010 census.

The Town of Mohawk is on the northern border of the county, west of the City of Amsterdam. The county seat, Fonda, is located in Mohawk.

==History==
Jesuit missionaries entered this region from Quebec around 1642 to work among the Mohawk. The principal village of the Mohawk was Caughnawaga, which was later developed as the site of Fonda.

The Town was settled around 1725 by colonists from the English/Dutch region to the east around Albany. The Mohawk District, which became the original Town of Mohawk, was created in March 1772 by Sir William Johnson when Tryon County was split off from Albany County. It was the easternmost of five districts in the new county, which eastern boundary ran north from the Delaware River at the Pennsylvania line through present Schoharie County to a north–south line that now forms the eastern boundaries of Montgomery, Fulton, and Hamilton Counties, all the way to Canada. The district&#x27;s western limit was an arbitrary north–south line drawn through &quot;the noses&quot;, prominent rock prominences through which the Mohawk River flows four miles east of Canajoharie (on the south side).

During the American Revolution, the town was invaded in 1780 by an army of British-Allied Iroquois and British Loyalists. The original District or &quot;Town of Mohawk&quot; was eliminated in 1793 by its division into the Towns of Florida and Charleston. The present town was created from part of the Town of Johnstown in 1837, the population of which was 3,112.

In 1865, the population of Mohawk was 2,948.

In 1993, Montgomery Manor, a colonial estate of Major Jelles Fonda, was purchased by the not-for-profit community, Kanatsiohareke (“Gah nah joe hah lay geh”). This Haudenosaunee community is led by elder and spiritual leader Tom Sakokwenionkwas Porter. This community looks to promote the development of the traditions, philosophy, and governance of the Haudenosaunee, and to contribute to the preservation of the culture of the Haudenosaunee.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (1.92%) is water.

The northern town line is the border of Fulton County, New York, and the southern town boundary is defined by the Mohawk River.

The Palatines built the Palatine Church in 1770, which still holds Lutheran services. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

The Town was formed in 1788 after the American Revolutionary War from the &quot;Palatine District&quot; in the newly organized Montgomery County. In 1797, part of the town was used to form the town of Salisbury (now in Herkimer County). The formation of other towns that eventually were in adjacent counties further reduced Palatine in size.

<text>Atlantic Beach is a village located on the west end of the Long Beach Barrier Island in the Town of Hempstead, in Nassau County, New York, United States. The population was 1,707 at the time of the 2020 census.

The Incorporated Village of Atlantic Beach is located on Long Beach Barrier Island – one of the outer barrier islands – which it shares with Long Beach, East Atlantic Beach, Lido Beach, and Point Lookout. It is a suburb of New York City and shares a maritime border with Far Rockaway, Queens.

To the North, Atlantic Beach is bordered by Reynolds Channel and East Rockaway Inlet. Atlantic Beach is home to the oldest beach club in the United States, the Lawrence Beach Club.

During the summer months, the population swells by thousands as people flood the beaches and the summer residents move in. Atlantic Beach residents may obtain season passes and access the beaches through nine entrances. It has been described as the &quot;Genuine &#x27;Old New York&#x27; paradise&quot;.

==History==

=== Conception and early history ===
The first real interest in modern-day Atlantic Beach came in 1922 when Robert Moses – the famous highway builder and public works czar, and Chairman of the State Council of Parks – included Atlantic Beach as part of his &quot;State Park Plan for New York&quot;. The blueprints, which are on file at the archives in Albany, showed a parkway from central Queens to a bridge crossing Reynolds Channel with architecturally refined facilities for thousands of beach goers; however, cost overruns on many of Robert Moses&#x27; other projects at the time and other factors dampened his plans, which were ultimately abandoned.

=== Founding and early history ===
In 1923, the village&#x27;s first developer, Atlantic Beach Associates led by Stephen P. Pettit, a former Nassau County Sheriff and banker from Freeport, had dreams of creating a place that would rival the City of Long Beach, which was created by a Politician and amusement park operator named William H. Reynolds. He died just after buying land for 3,500 lots in Atlantic Beach.

In 1926, real estate tycoon William Austin, who graduated from Yale University with his associate, Charles N. Talbot Jr, formed Island Park Associates which purchased the land for $4,000,000. William Austin was married to Actress Josephine Sanders, better known as Irene Delroy; the wedding was officiated by Mayor James J. Walker on July 15, 1931. Austin and Talbot completed Pettit&#x27;s preliminary dredging and. shoring work, and proceeded to subdivide the property. They installed gas and electricity lines, and a sanitary sewer system was installed in 1927. They began selling land and building homes; the first 45 of the 150 homes they planned on building were financed using a mortgage from The Title Guarantee and Trust Company. The. homes were all designed with seven rooms, two baths, private detached garages on 48&#x27; x 88&#x27; lots and were built in a wide array of styles. Mr. Austin finished Petitt&#x27;s plan to build a bridge between Far Rockaway and Atlantic beach, which was opened and dedicated on June 29, 1927. A boardwalk was planned for the entire ocean side but, as constructed, it was about a mile long, stretching from west of The Plaza and extending beyond Vernon Avenue, and double the width of the boardwalk which exists today.

The Castles Beach Club opened in May 1928, which contained one of the largest pools on the South Shore of Long Island. The Atlantic Beach Club, later known as the Atlantic Beach Hotel and Cabana Club, the ABH, opened in 1930 and plans were announced for the building of the Casa Del Mar (later the Nautilus Hotel)), an apartment hotel, which upon completion became an overnight sensation and, in August 1930, the new homeowners in Atlantic Beach joined together and formed the Atlantic Beach Property Owner&#x27;s Association. The United States Olympic Diving team practiced at the Atlantic Beach Hotel.

The community attracted the wealthy due to its resort atmosphere produced by the beach clubs. Many members of the social register frequented or lived in Atlantic Beach. Atlantic Beach is sometimes referred to as the “Palm Beach of New York”, and is to many a summer paradise. Later on, in the 1960s, the village was frequented by the Kennedys. The village was a big draw when the Hamptons were just a pile of sand.

During Prohibition, local swimmers would guide dories (Small boats) full of alcohol to shore from Canadian ships anchored nearby.

Atlantic Beach became of vital importance to the government during World War II. A 120-foot concrete lookout tower was constructed at the tip of Silverpoint with both the bridge and its access to Silverpoint being designated as emergency military routes in time of war. During this time, homeowners also patrolled the beaches for signs of enemy submarines. By the end of World War II, Atlantic Beach had become a summer mecca with thousands of city dweller clogging what were then only local streets through both the Rockaways and the Five Towns. Beach clubs helped to support the war effort by abiding by dim-out requirements, offering bus service, installing bike racks, and some even allowed their guest to stay overnight (which now is strictly forbidden). The Ocean Club, at the time known as the Ocean Club of Forest Hills, held an acclaimed social events in support of the war effort.

On October 14, 1950, a groundbreaking ceremony for the new Atlantic Beach Bridge was held and the ribbon cutting ceremony for the new bridge was held on May 10, 1952.

In June 1953, the reconstruction of the boardwalk from The Plaza to Putnam was completed. This boardwalk was half the width and shorter than the prior boardwalk.

=== Fight for incorporation ===
Before incorporation in 1962, the residents were banded together in a property owners’ association. Before the incorporation, it turned over the deeds to the community&#x27;s beaches to the Town of Hempstead and for a while, everything was fine. However, according to Mayor Lager “, the town tried to extend the use of the beaches to everyone in the town and we fought it. The town&#x27;s response to our objections was, in effect, ‘Sue us&#x27;. So we sought permission to be incorporated as a village from the county and when we finally won our village status the deeds automatically reverted to the village.” The Village held its first elections in June 1962. Fred Lager was the mayor for the first 28 years, until 1996. Initially, the village was not granted zoning powers due to an amendment to Nassau County&#x27;s charter, however, zoning powers were fought for, and taken over by the village in 2002. The Atlantic Beach Village Office, at 60 Park Street, officially opened on November 18, 1962.

As of 2021, Atlantic Beach remains the only village in Nassau County to have incorporated itself after the county charter was amended in the 1930s.

=== Modern history ===
The new Atlantic Beach Village Hall at 65 The Plaza officially opened on June 6, 1971.

During the 1970s, a player for The New York Rangers died in Atlantic Beach following a fight with one of his fellow players.

In the 1970s there was controversy regarding allegations by a geologist that NYC was dumping sludge and oil, that allegedly affected Atlantic Beach.

In 1984, Atlantic Beach&#x27;s Ocean Club was sued for allegedly discriminating against Jewish guests and applicants. The 1980s also saw many of the celebrities and summer residents moved out towards the Hamptons. Some residents from Long Beach moved into Atlantic Beach as they became wealthier.

In 1991, an African American resident of the village named Alfred Jermaine Ewell was beaten up and hospitalized after a Lawrence public school graduation event in the village. Later, Reverend Al Sharpton bussed in people and led a march from the town of Inwood to Atlantic Beach; he received mix results, as Atlantic Beach is a very open and welcoming community. Additionally, the boy&#x27;s mother decided not to partake in the march. Later, people were tried, and a man was found guilty of the attack.

In 1996, Stephen Mahler replaced Fred Lager as mayor; Lager was the first and third Mayor of the Incorporated Village of Atlantic Beach.

In 2007 it was rumored that Donald Trump&#x27;s Trump Organization and Toll Brothers wanted to develop the oceanfront, however this has not come to fruition.

In 2012, Atlantic beach was severely impacted by Hurricane Sandy.

Many young buyers, including people from Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, have snapped up Atlantic Beach houses as they grew tired of commuting three or more hours to the Hamptons or the Jersey Shore. However, there are only three oceanfront homes in the Village, most of the homes are either not on the water, or they face Reynolds channel. There are many summer-time rentals in the village.

In 2014, George Pappas assumed the Mayorship from Stephen Mahler, who had served as Mayor for the previous 18 years.
Republican Bruce Blakeman represented the Village of Atlantic Beach, Atlantic Beach Estates and East Atlantic Beach as a Town of Hempstead Councilman before becoming Nassau County Executive.

During the summer of 2016, a paddle-boarder from the village was found dead at sea. Michael Bloomberg spoke at his funeral.

There are still many beach clubs along the beach. There is also an old-age home called the Nautilus. A development called Pebble Cove was built along the Ocean between Putnam Blvd and Vernon Avenue. Pebble Cove is a 48-town-house complex with gated security and a swimming pool.

During the summer of 2019, there was an article about an Uber driver who kidnapped a girl from Atlantic Beach.

=== Resistance to development ===
Many of the beach club&#x27;s owners have tried to buy additional lots in the village, however, most attempts have been rebuffed by the village board; the residents are staunchly opposed to any development that is not in-line with the character of the village, even until this day. A relatively recent attempt to develop beachside condos was supported by former Senator D&#x27;Amato – although this attempt, too, failed. Additionally, residents have opposed the construction of an Eruv, since Atlantic Beach residents did not want Atlantic Beach to be as filled with Orthodox Jews as the neighboring towns of Lawrence and Cedarhurst had become. In 1989, one resident told the New York Times that they thought the eruv would encourage the &quot;ghettoization&quot; of the community. As of 2020, there is an eruv in Atlantic Beach, which is fully operational and checked weekly.

== Geography and wildlife ==
=== Access and street layout ===
The blocks in Atlantic Beach are in alphabetical order named after counties in New York State and are in alphabetical order from A-Z, with the exception of X and Z. There are three main roads that intersect these blocks in the Village: Bay Boulevard, Park Street, and Ocean Boulevard. As Park Street enters into East Atlantic Beach, it becomes Beech Street. The blocks in West Atlantic Beach are from A-G. There are four main roads that intersect these roads: Ocean Boulevard, Pacific Boulevard, Atlantic Boulevard (a continuation of Park Street), and Bay Boulevard.

Atlantic Beach is connected to the rest of Long Island by the Atlantic Beach Bridge. Atlantic Beach has the only toll-bridge in Nassau County, the Atlantic Beach Bridge. In 1952, the original bridge was replaced by the Nassau County Bridge Authority. Although the toll is somewhat controversial due to allegations of patronage, Atlantic Beach residents support it since it helps to control traffic in the village. The bridge is notorious for frequently opening to let ships through.

The Atlantic Beach Fire District, a special district of the Town of Hempstead, is responsible for providing fire and emergency ambulance services for the village. Atlantic Beach, however, does not have its own fire department, and therefore contracts out fire protection to the Long Beach Fire Department.

Emergency ambulance services are provided by a combination of Atlantic Beach Rescue Squad and the Long Beach Fire Department. The Atlantic Beach Rescue Unit officially went into service in 1975.

Police protection is provided by the 4th Precinct of the Nassau County Police Department. 

The Greater Atlantic Beach Water Reclamation District provides sanitary sewage services to the village – in addition to East Atlantic Beach and Atlantic Beach Estates.

==Education==
Its school district is Lawrence Public Schools.

<text>Baldwin is a hamlet located in the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, in Long Island, New York, United States. It had a population of 33,919 in 2020.

==History==

The original inhabitants of this area between Parsonage Creek near Oceanside and Milburn Creek near Freeport were Native Americans known as the Meroke, or Merrick, a band of Lenape people who were indigenous to most of the South Shore of Long Island. They spoke an Algonquian language and lived in two villages along Milburn Creek.

In 1643, English colonists began to call this area Hick&#x27;s Neck, after one of two of Hempstead&#x27;s early settlers, John Spragg from England and John Hicks from Flushing, New York. They extended the Hempstead village south to the salt meadows. The grist mill built by John Pine in 1686 on Milburn Creek attracted more English settlers. They engaged in fishing, farming, marshing, raising longwood, and breeding and raising sheep. Between the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, Hick&#x27;s Neck continued to grow, becoming a prosperous agricultural area.

The first churches were built in the area in 1810 and 1872, and the first school was built in 1813.

Sometime around the early 19th century Hick&#x27;s Neck began to be called Milburn. The first documented use of the name Milburn was in 1839. In 1855, the village was officially founded as Baldwinsville, named in honor of Thomas Baldwin (1795–1872), a sixth-generation member of the Baldwin family of Hempstead and the leading merchant of Milburn at the time. Baldwin owned a general store named T. Baldwin and Sons. He also had a hotel at what would now be considered the northwest corner of Merrick Road and Grand Avenue.

In 1867, the South Side Railroad began operating at a station in Baldwinsville. In 1870, one of Thomas Baldwin&#x27;s sons, Francis Baldwin, became a member of the New York State Assembly representing Queens County&#x27;s 2nd District; he later served as the Queens County treasurer. During this time, Baldwinsville was part of Queens County. A year later, the name of the village was changed from Baldwinsville to Baldwins by the U.S. Postal Service so as to not confuse it with the village of Baldwinsville in upstate New York. By 1892, by an act of local government, the village was officially named Baldwin.

Shortly after Hempstead separated from Queens County in 1899, people began to move to &quot;Beautiful Baldwin&quot;, as it was called by Charles Luerssen, a village realtor. The village had boating (sailboats), bathing, and fishing. By 1939, ten years after the opening of Sunrise Highway, Baldwin became the largest unincorporated village in New York State—a title that was lost to Levittown by 1960.

In the 1990 US Census, the area south of Atlantic Avenue was designated as Baldwin Harbor, a hamlet and census-designated place. Baldwin Harbor remains a part of Baldwin&#x27;s ZIP code, school district, and library system.

In May 1910, a breakthrough in American aviation history was made in Baldwin. The first all-American monoplane was designed, built, and successfully flown at this location by brothers Arthur and Albert Heinrich. The project was developed at the site now occupied by the Plaza Elementary School on Seaman Avenue and Rockville Drive. In the plane&#x27;s initial and subsequent models, its unique designs featured controls that were combined into one stick, which allowed the pilot to fly the plane using one hand.

<doc id="126669" wikidata="Q3476988" url="?curid=126669" title="Barnum Island, New York">
<text>Barnum Island is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in Nassau County, New York, United States. The population was 2,590 at the 2020 census. It occupies the eastern portion of an island situated between Long Island and Long Beach. That island, previously known in its entirety as Hog Island, consists entirely of the communities of Barnum Island and Island Park.

Barnum Island is an unincorporated area of the Town of Hempstead. Most of Barnum Island is separated from the Village of Island Park by the LIRR&#x27;s Long Beach Branch rail line to Long Beach.

Barnum Island has its own fire district and school district, but is under contract with the Village of Island Park for fire and education services for its residents. Barnum Island is included in the Island Park School District and ZIP code (11558).

The E.F. Barrett Power Station is located within the hamlet.

==History==
Previously called Hog Island, after the feral pigs introduced by early European explorers to the Native Americans, it was later renamed for Sarah Ann Baldwin Barnum. It was also sometimes called Jekyl Island, after the name of the development company that bought it from the county.

Between 1851 and 1870, Sarah Ann&#x27;s husband Peter owned large parcels of land on Long Island, though his primary business was a Manhattan clothier. Sarah Ann arranged the purchase of Hog Island for use as a &quot;poor farm&quot; – a self-supporting almshouse, a social innovation for that period, and the island was renamed in her honor.

Local lore connects the island&#x27;s name to P.T. Barnum, the circus impresario, but this is incorrect, and likely due to confusion between &quot;PT&quot; and &quot;PC&quot; (Peter C.).

The county discontinued the almshouse and sold the island to the Jekyl Island Realty Company in 1898 for $40,000. The company renamed it &quot;Jekyl Island.&quot; The island changed hands several times in 1909, Jekyl sold it to a syndicate of developers for $120,000, who in turn sold it for $650,000 in 1911. (There may have been an interim sale in 1910 as well.) Minimal development at that time included construction of several canals, before work was abandoned. One of those canals divides the Harbor Isle section from Island Park.

New developers bought the island in 1921, and started building about 10,000 properties built in the 700 acre Island Park section in the center of the island starting in 1922. It was in use as a summer resort by 1925., Island Park was incorporated as a village in 1926.

The rest of the island remains unincorporated, with the western portion known as Harbor Island, and the eastern portion retaining the name Barnum Island. However, all three make up the original Hog Island/Barnum Island, and are part of the Town of Hempstead.

The entire island was flooded with two to eight feet of water and sewage by Hurricane Sandy.

<text>Baxter Estates is a village in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. It is considered part of the Greater Port Washington area, which is anchored by Port Washington. The population was 991 at the time of the 2020 census.

The Incorporated Village of Baxter Estates is located on the Cow Neck Peninsula, within the Town of North Hempstead, and is recognized as a Tree City USA.

==History==
The Village of Baxter Estates was incorporated in 1931. Baxter Estates owes much of its history to the homestead settlement of &quot;Cow Neck&quot; built in 1673 by John Betts and Robert Hutchings, which still stands on its original site at the corner of Central Drive and Shore Road, overlooking Manhasset Bay. This property was purchased around 1741 by Oliver Baxter, and maps of the time show that an entire wigwam village, belonging to the Matinecock Indians, may have been located on Baxter&#x27;s land.

The Baxters, who were shipbuilders, whalers and sea captains, retained the property until the 19th century. Hessian troops were quartered in the Baxter House during the Revolutionary War, and in 1895 the first library of Port Washington met in the parlor of the Baxter House. The residence was designated as a historic building. In the 2010s, the owner of the home, Sabrina Wu, was in the process of submitting plans to demolish the landmarked home when a massive blaze broke out, heavily damaging the home on February 5, 2017. The cause of the fire was not determined.
