==Economy==
Williston&#x27;s economy, while historically based in agriculture and especially ranching, is increasingly being driven by the oil industry. The Williston Basin, named after the town, is a huge subterranean geologic feature known for its rich deposits of petroleum, coal, and potash. 

Williston developed over the Bakken formation, which by the end of 2012 was predicted to be producing more oil than any other site in the United States, surpassing even Alaska&#x27;s Prudhoe Bay, the longtime leader in domestic output in the nation. The oil boom has been spurred here by the development of new technologies—such as fracking—which enabled extraction from areas previously inaccessible.

In 1995, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated that there were 150 million barrels of oil &quot;technically recoverable&quot; from the Bakken shale. In April 2008, the number was said to be about four billion barrels; in 2010 geologists at Continental Resources, the major drilling operation in North Dakota, estimated the reserve at eight billion. In March 2012, after the discovery of a lower shelf of oil, it announced a possible 24 billion barrels. Although current technology allows for extraction of only about 6% of the oil trapped beneath the earth&#x27;s surface, recoverable oil might eventually exceed 500 billion barrels.

Williston has seen a huge increase in population and infrastructure investments during the last several years with expanded drilling using the fracking petroleum extraction technique in the Bakken Formation and Three Forks Groups. Examples of oil industry-related infrastructure investments are the multi-acre branch campus of Baker Hughes and the Sand Creek Retail Center.

A major regional grain elevator is served by the BNSF Railway. Williston&#x27;s livestock arena has weekly auctions.

Forts Union and Buford, as well as the nearby confluence of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers west of the city, associated with the history of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and development of the fur trade and frontier—are destinations for area tourism. Williston is also comparatively close to the North Unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park.

==Education==
The Williston Basin School District 7 serves the entire city, with Williston High School as its public high school.

Due to a merger of the Williston Public School District #1 and the Williams County School District 8 (formerly New School District) in 2021, Williston has one school district. Previously almost all of the city was in the former with small sections in the latter. Prior to 2021, District 8, which was K–8 only, sent high school students to Williston High. District 8 also sent high school students to the Nesson School District in Ray and to the Tioga School District in Tioga.

Trinity Christian School is a private K–12 school, and St. Joseph Catholic School (of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bismarck) a private K–6 school, both located in Williston.

Williston State College, on University Avenue, was founded in 1961 as the University of North Dakota—Williston (UND-W). It is a two-year public college in the North Dakota University System (NDUS). Students can earn Associate in Arts (AA), Associate in Science (AS), and Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degrees, and transfer to the state universities offering four-year programs and degrees.

The Williston Public Library serves as the public library for all of Williams County. The library also has a bookmobile that serves rural schools and retirement home communities. The main library also serves as a community center, hosting many groups that hold public meetings there. 

The library hosts an annual fundraiser called &quot;Table of Contents&quot;, for which local patrons create unique table arrangements and dining themes. Proceeds are used to purchase equipment for local organizations that hold public meetings at the library. Numerous public events, including voting stations, are regularly held at the library.

The first Williston Public Library was completed in town in 1911, opening February 27, 1911, and it operated as the only facility until 1983. In the early 1990s the city began to address the issue of probable demolition of this aged building to replace it with one meeting modern needs. 

In 1993 a concerned group of citizens formed the James Memorial Preservation Society to save the historic building and develop it as a center for the visual arts. After the library moved to a new building on Davidson Drive, this structure became known as the James Memorial Art Center. It was adapted for use as an art gallery and event center. The James Memorial Art Center now hosts an annual Art Fest, art classes for youth and adults, and exhibits by local, national, and international artists.

==Government==
In 2016, the Ohio Auditor of State deemed Rome to be &quot;unauditable&quot; due to recordkeeping issues and a lack of elected village leadership. A 2021 analysis of the village by the Auditor of State determined that there had been no elected officials since 1995, and that the village had not approved a tax budget since at least 2016; these criteria, in addition to considering the village&#x27;s small size, led the Auditor to request that the Ohio Attorney General begin legal action to dissolve the village.

==Transportation==

Beaverdam lies at the junction of the old Lincoln Highway and the Dixie Highway. These early highways were begun in 1914.

Currently Beaverdam&#x27;s economy is dominated by three large truck stops on what is now the junction of Interstate 75 and U.S. Route 30. Beaverdam was the eastern terminus of the four lane section of US 30. This meant that vehicular traffic going east on the four lane portion of US 30 that extended from Fort Wayne, Indiana had to exit the four-lane road and shift to a two-lane road. This required exit enhanced the village&#x27;s function as an area for refueling of vehicles. US 30 is now a continuous four-lane highway in this part of Ohio that bypasses Beaverdam, but the significance of the junction as a major fuel stop has not been diminished. In the summer of 2006 the exit ramps and overpass on I-75 were widened to accommodate heavy truck and car traffic to the truck stops.

<text>Lima ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Allen County, Ohio, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 35,579. It is located in northwest Ohio along Interstate 75, approximately north of Dayton, southwest of Toledo, and southeast of Fort Wayne, Indiana.

Lima was founded in 1831. The Lima Army Tank Plant, officially called the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center, built in 1941, is the sole producer of the M1 Abrams. It is the principal city of the Lima metropolitan area, which had 102,000 residents in 2020 and is included in the Lima–Van Wert–Wapakoneta combined statistical area.

==History==
===Establishment===
In the years after the American Revolution, the Shawnee were the most prominent residents of west central Ohio, growing in numbers and permanency after the 1794 Treaty of Greenville. By 1817, the United States had created the Hog Creek Reservation for the local Shawnee, covering portions of what would become Allen and Auglaize counties, and including part of present-day Lima.

The creation of the Shawnee reservation freed other lands in the area for settlement, and in February 1820, the Ohio legislature formally established Allen County. In 1831, the Shawnee were forced to surrender all their land in the area to the United States and relocated to Kansas, opening all of Allen County to settlement. The Ohio legislature mandated that a county seat be established and &quot;Lima&quot; was the result.

Lima was named after Lima, Peru&#x27;s capital city. The name was reputedly chosen in a nod to the Peruvian capital which, during the 1800s, was a major source of quinine, an anti-malaria drug for which there had been a demand in the region, an area known as the Great Black Swamp.

===19th century===
Since 1831, Lima has been the center of government for Allen County, the first of its three courthouses erected in the city&#x27;s first year. The foundations of city life followed in quick order. The first school appeared in 1832. Lima&#x27;s first physician, Dr. William Cunningham, arrived in 1831. 1836 brought the first newspaper to Lima. Lima was officially organized as a city in 1842. Henry DeVilliers Williams was its first mayor. The first public school opened in 1850. In 1854, the first train appeared in Lima, a harbinger of later economic success.

Also in 1854, a cholera outbreak in Delphos (a town in Allen County northwest of Lima) spread throughout west central Ohio. Countywide problems caused by the contaminated water supply were not solved until 1886 when Lima started a municipal water system. Lima&#x27;s role as a regional center for industry began early. The Lima Agricultural Works began operations in 1869. The company changed names and types of manufacturing through the years. In 1882, under the name Lima Machine Works, the industry built the first Shay-geared locomotive.

Stimulated by the economic boom in nearby Findlay, in 1885 Lima businessman Benjamin C. Faurot drilled for natural gas at his paper mill. On May 19, oil was discovered instead of gas. The oil well never realized enormous profits, but it triggered Lima&#x27;s oil industry, bringing John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s Standard Oil to the city. Lima&#x27;s oil field was, for about a decade, the largest in the US.

Economic development brought money for arts and entertainment. Benjamin Faurot&#x27;s Opera House opened in 1882, a nationally renowned structure so impressive that New Yorkers used it as a model for their theaters. In 1907, Lima built its first movie theater.

===Early 20th century===
In the early 20th century, Benjamin A. Gramm and his close friend Max Bernstein formed the Gramm-Bernstein Company, which became a pioneer in the motor truck industry. During World War I, Gramm created the &quot;Liberty truck&quot;, which was welcomed upon its arrival in Washington, D.C., by President Woodrow Wilson. Thousands were sent to Europe to help the Allied war effort.

After World War I, Allen County&#x27;s population growth lagged the state and the nation. Galvin was an assistant superintendent at the Peru Steel Casting Co. of Peru, Ind. He then became acting manager at American Steel Foundries in Pittsburgh. In 1921, Lima voters approved a change in the structure of Lima city government. Voters now elected five commissioners, with the commission chair serving as mayor. The charter sought to establish professional management, requiring the commissioners to hire a city manager, who reported to the mayor. Lima proved itself to be very much in the Progressive tradition with these changes, after flirting with radicalism in 1912 when the voters elected a Socialist mayor.

The darker side of the progressive era revealed itself in the prominence of the Ku Klux Klan in the city. It was a center for the Black Legion, a notoriously violent subset of the Klan. On August 1, 1923, a KKK parade in Lima drew a crowd estimated at 100,000 people.

Economically, the 1920s were a time of industrial expansion in Lima. In 1925, Lima Locomotive Works, Inc. built the &quot;Lima A-1&quot;, a 2-8-4 model that became the prototype for the modern steam locomotive. The Locomotive Works also created a new division, the Ohio Power Shovel Company. In 1927, local industrialist John E. Galvin helped found Superior Coach Company. It became the world&#x27;s largest producer of school buses and funeral coaches within two decades. In 1930, eight railroad companies served Lima.

Allen County&#x27;s population grew significantly faster than the state during the Great Depression. In 1933, Lima again reorganized its government. The citizens adopted a &quot;strong mayor&quot; model to replace the city manager of the 1920s. Despite the hardships of the decade, Lima residents supported the construction of a hospital to serve the area. Lima Memorial Hospital, named in honor of World War I veterans, opened on Memorial Day, 1933.

The Lima area was not safe from the increased crime rate of the 1930s. In 1933, gangster John Dillinger was in the Allen County Jail, arrested for robbing the Citizens National Bank in nearby Bluffton. Dillinger&#x27;s cohorts broke him out of jail, killing Allen County Sheriff Jess Sarber in the process. The murder and jailbreak put Dillinger at the top of the FBI&#x27;s ten most wanted list. His was not the only crime outfit to plague Lima during the decade. In 1936, the notorious Brady Gang robbed a local jewelry store twice.
The Great Depression slowed the pace of industrial expansion. In 1930, a Lima directory listed 93 industrial employers with some 8,000 employees. By 1934, industrial employment was reduced by half. In 1935, Westinghouse located a Small Motor Division in Lima to build fractional horsepower electric motors. The Ohio Steel Foundry turned the corner and grew, eventually expanding its successes in its industry. The 1930s was a decade for organizing labor in Lima. By 1940, there were at least fifty labor unions representing local workers.

Lima benefited from increased production during World War II and a growing population but suffered a significant economic decline at the end of the decade when industry retooled for peacetime production. In May 1941, based in the steel foundry, construction began on the Lima Army Tank Plant to manufacture centrifugally cast gun tubes. In November 1942, United Motors Services took over the operation of the plant to process vehicles under government contract. The plant prepared many vehicles for Europe, including the M5 light tank and the T-26 Pershing tank. At its peak during the war, the Lima Tank Depot (now the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center, operated by General Dynamics), employed over 5,000 people.

===Late 20th century to present===

The area&#x27;s expanding population in the 1940s and 1950s brought hospital and school expansion. St Rita&#x27;s Hospital, founded in 1918, opened a seven-story addition in 1948. With voter support, school leadership built six new elementary schools and the new centralized Lima Senior High School during the 1950s. Lima&#x27;s industrial production grew in the decade. During the Korean War, the Lima Tank Depot resumed manufacturing, at a level expanded from World War II standards.

During the 1960s, Lima experienced both growth and community unrest. In 1962, a new Allen County Airport was built in Perry Township. With the passage of the city income tax in 1966, Lima constructed a new facility for the Lima Police Department. Also during the 1960s, The Ohio State University established a regional campus in Lima. Civil rights issues had rocked Lima in the 1950s, perhaps most prominently in the efforts to desegregate the city&#x27;s only public swimming pool in Schoonover Park. Civil unrest continued in the 1960s and into the 1970s.

In January 1969, a crude oil line in south Lima ruptured, causing of oil to escape into the city&#x27;s sewer system. Explosions and fire erupted from sewers as 7,000 residents were evacuated. Governor Jim Rhodes ordered the Ohio National Guard into the area to maintain order. In August 1970, further conflict erupted when a black woman was killed by police as she tried to prevent the arrest of a juvenile. Several officers were wounded in the violence that followed. Mayor Christian P. Morris declared a state of emergency and the National Guard was again called in to aid local police.

During the 1970s and 1980s, several industries left Lima, part of the &quot;Rust Belt&quot; decline affecting all of Ohio. In April 1971, the last &quot;Cincinnatian,&quot; of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad stopped in Lima. The Cincinnatian was an iconic lightweight streamliner serving the B&amp;O&#x27;s Detroit line from Cincinnati. Lima had also been served by the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Broadway Limited,&quot; a high-speed New York to Chicago service, the &quot;Capital Limited&quot; Chicago to Washington D.C. service, via Pittsburgh, the Nickel Plate Road&#x27;s &quot;Blue Arrow,&quot; and &quot;Blue Dart,&quot; which provided high-speed service to Buffalo, Cleveland and St. Louis, and the Erie Lackawanna&#x27;s &quot;Lake Cities,&quot; which provided service to New York, Cleveland, and Chicago with direct service both ways. Many of these services were maintained by Amtrak until 1991, when the former Erie Lackawanna and Pennsylvania Railroad mainlines between New York and Chicago were downgraded.

In 1973, Lima&#x27;s District Tuberculosis Center, which served five counties, closed its doors. Superior Coach Company, once the nation&#x27;s largest producer of buses, closed in 1981, as did Clark Equipment. Airfoil Textron closed in 1985, and Sundstrand (formerly Westinghouse) followed ten years later. By the mid-1990s, Lima had lost more than 8,000 jobs. Lima&#x27;s population dropped from 52,000 in the 1970s to 45,000 in 1999. Lima&#x27;s plight and its subsequent efforts to redefine itself were captured in the PBS documentary &quot;Lost in Middle America.&quot;

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The Ottawa River flows through the city. Locals sometimes refer to the river as &quot;Hawg Creek&quot;. This resembles a traditional local name used dating back to the Hog Creek Shawnee community that existed between Lima and present Ada, prior to the Shawnee removal of 1831. This removal made possible the official founding of &quot;Lima&quot; as a formal town in that year.

==Economy==
===Oil===

With the discovery of oil in Lima in 1885, Ohio began what came to be called the &quot;Oil Boom of Northwest Ohio&quot;. Discovery actually began in Findlay, a city forty miles north of Lima. The discovery of natural gas deposits there in 1884 led to national marketing efforts advertising free gas, as Findlay&#x27;s business leaders tried to &quot;boom&quot; the town. In 1885, Benjamin C. Faurot of Lima was one of hundreds of businessmen who visited Findlay to see the seemingly unlimited supply of natural gas burning day and night. Faurot owned the Lima Paper Mill. He spent $2,500 on energy consumption annually. Water for his operation was also a problem. So Faurot decided to drill in Lima – for gas or water. Faurot&#x27;s first oil, found along the Ottawa River on May 19, 1885, was more accidental discovery than deliberate scientific experiment.

During the first week, the well produced more than of oil. Faurot quickly organized local businessmen into a syndicate that would purchase oil leases from farm owners. The company was called the Trenton Rock Oil Company, and by 1886, had 250 wells from Lima to St. Marys, and west to Indiana.

When the news broke that northwest Ohio had oil, Standard Oil of Cleveland decided to build a refinery in Lima. Unlike Pennsylvania&#x27;s oil, northwest Ohio&#x27;s &quot;sour crude&quot; was high in sulfur content, smelling like rotten eggs, and customers shunned it. Lima&#x27;s new Solar Refinery was charged with solving the sulfur problem. Until then, Standard bought and stored as much northwest Ohio crude as was possible to maintain their monopoly. It dropped the price of crude from more than sixty cents a barrel to forty cents in an attempt to discourage further production.

Oil drilling fever hit northwest Ohio and &quot;boom towns&quot; sprang up overnight. There is also a significant pharmaceutical industry in Lima, with new resident Lak Hotra opening up the cities first Walgreens. Additional crude glutted the market, and trying to slow production, Standard Oil lowered its price to fifteen cents a barrel. This decision had little effect on the large producers elsewhere, but the smaller Lima producers, whose oil wells could not keep up, found themselves severely hampered. Fourteen independent Lima producers formed a combine – the Ohio Oil Company. Eventually, it became Marathon Oil, still located in Findlay.

Lima&#x27;s Solar Refinery General Manager John Van Dyke and Herman Frasch, Standard&#x27;s chemist, solved the distillation problem for sour crude by devising a method for removing the sulfur. The gamble that John D. Rockefeller took building pipelines and storage tanks for Ohio&#x27;s sour crude paid off. By 1901, the excitement about Ohio oil slowed with the news of a Beaumont, Texas, gusher producing .

In 1911, the courts declared Standard Oil Trust a monopoly and broke it into several companies. Between 1887 and 1905, the Lima Oil Field was a world-class producer, yielding . Lima was also a pipeline center. Within three years of the discovery of oil, a trunk line reached Chicago. Lima oil lit the buildings of the 1893 World&#x27;s Fair. Production peaked in 1904, and then dropped off rapidly. By 1910, the field was regarded as virtually played out. Still, the Lima Refinery has survived, continuing to operate for more than 125 years under a succession of owners—Solar Refining Company (1886), a subsidiary of Standard Oil until the breakup in 1911, Standard Oil of Ohio (1931), BP (1987), Clark USA (1998), Premcor (2000), Valero Energy Corporation (2005), and most recently Husky Energy (2007).

===Railroads===
For most of its history, smokestack industries and a blue-collar work ethic defined Lima. Nothing played a bigger part in shaping the city&#x27;s self-image than its connection to railroads and railroading – as a Midwestern rail hub and even more as home to the Lima Locomotive Works, whose products for more than 70 years carried the city&#x27;s name globally.

The first locomotive appeared in Allen County in 1854, brought in from Toledo as freight on the Miami and Erie Canal. Named the Lima, the engine was used on construction of the county&#x27;s first railroad, the Ohio and Indiana. East-west passenger service to Lima began in 1856, when the Ohio &amp; Indiana consolidated with the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne &amp; Chicago. North-south passenger service began in 1858 on the Dayton &amp; Michigan Railroad. Machine shops for the Dayton &amp; Michigan were built in Lima by 1860, and for the Lake Erie and Western Railroad by 1880. By the early years of the 20th century, the railroad shops employed 1,000 people in Lima.

In 1906, an average of 143 trains and 7,436 cars, carrying 223,080 tons of freight, passed through Lima every 24 hours. In addition, 49 steam and 28 electric trains landed passengers in Lima daily. Lima service on the electric interurban Ohio Western Railway began in 1902 and Lima became the hub of an interurban network that reached Toledo, Cleveland and Cincinnati as well as Fort Wayne, Indiana. In 1920, Lima was served by five steam railroads and Allen County by eight, in addition to five electric interurban lines.

For years, Lima was a crossroads for famous passenger trains including the Nickel Plate Road&#x27;s &quot;Clover Leaf&quot; &quot;Commercial Traveler&quot; and the Erie Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Erie Limited&quot; and &quot;Lake Cities.&quot; The Erie Railroad had its own train station. The other train companies used the Pennsylvania station. Pennsylvania Railroad train such as the &quot;Admiral,&quot; &quot;General,&quot; and &quot;Manhattan Limited&quot; made stops in Lima&#x27;s Pennsylvania station.

Railroads began to cut back passenger service to Lima during the Great Depression. Electric interurban service ceased in 1937. After a brief boom for railroads during World War II, passenger service declined sharply in the 1950s. The Nickel Plate Road ended scheduled passenger service to Lima in 1959. The formerly elite &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; began making stops in 1968 after the New York Central and the Pennsylvania railroad merged to form the Penn Central. The Erie-Lackawanna ran its last train into Lima in 1970 and the Baltimore &amp; Ohio and the Penn Central their last in 1971. Freight still moves over most of the historic rail routes in and out of the city, but the last passenger train to stop in Lima was the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot;, then operated by Amtrak, on November 11, 1990.

Currently, there are only a handful of railroads that serve Lima. The Chicago, Fort Wayne, and Eastern and the Indiana and Ohio railroad are owned by Genesee &amp; Wyoming and are in the north and east parts of town. CSX Transportation runs through town frequently and the Norfolk Southern Railway has one train each day to Lima. The R.J. Corman Railroad/Western Ohio Line runs southwest from town on former Erie-Lackawanna trackage.

===Lima Locomotive Works===

The Lima Locomotive Works – &quot;the Loco,&quot; as it was commonly called in Lima – had its beginnings in 1869 when John Carnes and four partners bought a machine shop that was called the Lima Agricultural Works. The company initially manufactured and repaired agricultural equipment, then moved into the production of steam power equipment and sawmill machinery. The shop designed its first narrow-gauge steam locomotive in 1878. The same year, the shop first worked on a geared locomotive designed by Michigan lumberman Ephraim Shay. The Shay locomotive was built for steep grades, heavy loads and tight turns. In 1881, Shay granted the Lima works an exclusive license to manufacture his locomotives. By 1882, locomotives were the company&#x27;s main product. In time, the Lima Locomotive Works – a name formally adopted in 1916 – would produce 2,761 Shay locomotives, which were sent to 48 states and 24 foreign countries. As of 2005, some were in use 100 years after they were shipped.

By 1910, the company was moving aggressively into direct-drive locomotives for general railroad use. A new &quot;super power&quot; design, introduced in 1925, enabled Lima to capture 20% of the national market for locomotives. The &quot;super power&quot; locomotive was created by mechanical engineer William E. Woodard. Designed to make more efficient use of steam at high speed, it became, in the words of railroad historian Eric Hirsimaki, &quot;one of the most influential locomotives in the history of steam power&quot;. Later years saw the introduction of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway 2-6-6-6, one of the largest locomotives ever built, and the glamorous Southern Pacific &quot;Daylights,&quot; designed to complement the Pacific Coast scenery.

The locomotive works dabbled in other product lines. It produced railroad cars in the early years and acquired the Ohio Power Shovel Company in 1928. During World War II, the plant produced 1,655 Sherman tanks. Employment grew from 150 in the 1890s to 1,100 in 1912 and 2,000 in 1915, peaking at 4,300 in 1944. Over the course of its history, the Locomotive Works was a microcosm of the community, a place where each successive wave of newcomers took its place in turn. First the Germans and Italians, later African-Americans and ultimately women joining the work force during World War II. Labor organizing efforts were under way at the plant at least by the 1890s.

Post-war mergers attempting to keep the plant operating created the Lima-Hamilton Corporation in 1947 and later Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton in 1950. The last steam locomotive built at the plant, Nickel Plate No. 779, was delivered May 13, 1949. It is now on display in Lima&#x27;s Lincoln Park. The final diesel locomotive, built by Lima-Hamilton, was delivered in 1951. After the end of locomotive production, the plant continued to produce cranes and road building equipment. The plant was sold to Clark Equipment in 1971. Clark employed 1,500 as late as 1974, but the plant closed permanently in 1981. As of 2006, the Lima Locomotive Works plant has been razed.

==Arts and culture==

In January 1953, a committee composed of John LaRotonda, Ben Schultz, Dom Trovarelli and Fred Mills organized the Lima Symphony Orchestra. This committee selected Lawrence Burkhalter as the Symphony&#x27;s first conductor and the LSO made its debut performance on May 23, 1954, in the Central High School auditorium.

Among the city&#x27;s most distinctive residential neighborhoods, the &quot;Golden Block&quot; on the west side, was almost entirely demolished in the 1960s; only the MacDonell House, part of the Allen County Museum, and the YWCA survived. The YWCA would be demolished decades later, coming down in 2019. Today, the city includes twenty-four buildings and one historic district that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Allen County Courthouse, the post office, the Barr Hotel, the Hotel Argonne, and the Neal Clothing Building.

==Sports==
Lima also is home to the Lima Warriors, a semi-pro American football team that plays in the Ohio Football League. UNOH and OSU Lima athletics, as well as various high school sports programs. Lima is also home to the collegiate summer baseball team, the Lima Locos. Started in 2023, Lima is the home of the Ohio Extreme, a professional indoor soccer team that plays in the MLIS.

==Government==
Harry J. Moyer was the mayor of Lima from 1974 to 1985 and council president the previous four years. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine Moyer&#x27;s campaign slogan in 1973 was &quot;Let&#x27;s get together and make Lima better — without any new taxes&quot; and his &quot;strategy is to merge public funds with private effort&quot;. Moyer was the city&#x27;s second-longest-serving mayor and its first to serve three terms.

Moyer was defeated in a 1989 election by David J. Berger(D), who served as mayor from December 1989 to November 2021. Upon Berger&#x27;s retirement in November 2021, his chief of staff, Sharetta Smith, was sworn in as mayor after winning her election earlier in the month.

On the federal level, Lima is located in Ohio&#x27;s 4th congressional district, which is represented by Republican Jim Jordan.

==Education==
Colleges in Lima include the private University of Northwestern Ohio, the public regional campus Ohio State University at Lima, and James A. Rhodes State College.

Secondary schools in Lima include Lima Senior High School, Apollo Career Center, Lima Central Catholic High School, Lima Christian Academy, and Temple Christian School.

Schools in the county&#x27;s Board of Developmental Disabilities include The Center for Autism and Dyslexia, and Marimor School.

==Media==
Lima is served by one daily newspaper, &quot;The Lima News&quot;. In addition to the immediate Allen County area, the paper serves residents in Auglaize, Hancock, Hardin, Logan, Mercer, Putnam, Shelby and Van Wert counties.

As of the 2016–2017 television season, Lima is ranked by Nielsen Media Research as the second smallest television market in Ohio, ahead of only Zanesville, and the 190th nationwide. The Lima area is served by four major broadcast stations, with three of those stations based in the city. WLIO 8 serves as its NBC affiliate (with Fox/MyNetworkTV on DT2), while low-powered sister station WOHL-CD 35.1 operates as the market&#x27;s ABC affiliate, with CBS on 35.2. WLMA 44 serves as a religious/family-entertainment station. The market&#x27;s PBS member station, WBGU-TV 27, is based out of Bowling Green State University and also serves as a secondary PBS member station for the nearby Toledo market. CW viewers are served on cable by that network&#x27;s Dayton affiliate, WBDT.
The Lima area is served by 22 FM and 3 AM radio stations.

==Infrastructure==
===Roads===
Lima is at the intersection of Ohio State Route 309 (the original Lincoln Highway) and state routes 65, 81 and 117. Interstate 75, which replaced U.S. Route 25, one of the routes of the Dixie Highway passes on the eastern perimeter of Lima. U.S. Route 30 passes east–west a few miles north of Lima.

===Healthcare===

The first doctor in Allen County, Samuel Jacob Lewis, was assigned to duty at Fort Amanda in 1812.

Lima has been a regional medical center since its earliest days. Currently, the city&#x27;s two hospitals serve a 10-county area of northwest and west central Ohio. St. Rita&#x27;s Medical Center, a level 2 trauma center, with nearly 4,000 employees as of June 2006, is Allen County&#x27;s largest employer while Lima Memorial Health System ranks third. In 2005, St. Rita&#x27;s embarked on a $130 million expansion expected to create up to 500 more jobs, this new addition is known as &quot;The Medical Center of the Future&quot;. In 2018 St. Rita&#x27;s name was changed to Mercy Health St. Rita&#x27;s Medical Center, after the company Mercy Health that had owned St. Rita&#x27;s for a while now. This name change brought new signs and uniforms to the hospital. Almost immediately after the name change, Mercy Health was acquired by another company by the name of Bon Secours. This merge has brought no changes to the hospital though.

The Roman Catholic Church Sisters of Mercy opened St. Rita&#x27;s in December 1918, in the midst of a national (and global) influenza epidemic. The hospital saw major expansions 1945 and 1967. The hospital has also created satellite facilities in the surrounding towns of Ottawa, Delphos and Wapakoneta. SRMC also houses a separate hospital with the walls of the main facility. This &quot;interior&quot; facility, &quot;Triumph&quot;, was implemented to serve poverty-level citizens who are unable to afford continuing care otherwise. In July 2008, St. Rita&#x27;s Medical Center purchased Lima Allen County Paramedics.

Lima Memorial Health System, formerly Lima Memorial Hospital, a level 2 trauma center, can trace its roots to 1899, when it began as Lima City Hospital. Formed by the Pastors Union of Lima, the 13-bed facility was the first community hospital in northwest Ohio. During the Great Depression, the city of Lima helped to finance a larger hospital, which opened on Memorial Day 1933 on the city&#x27;s east side. The region&#x27;s first open-heart surgery was performed at Lima Memorial on April 22, 1997. In 1999, LMHS entered into a joint venture with Blanchard Valley Health Association (&quot;BVHA&quot;) and ProMedica Health System.

For decades, Lima also had two other hospitals with different missions. The Ottawa Valley Hospital, which opened in 1909 as the District Tuberculosis Hospital, was one of the first in the state dedicated to the treatment of tubercular patients. The hospital treated patients from seven to 90 years old, at a time when tuberculosis was nearly always fatal. The average stay was three to five years. As treatment improved, the hospital closed, though the building was used until 1973.

The facility originally known as the Lima State Hospital for the Criminally Insane was situated on three miles (5 km) north of downtown Lima. The hospital was constructed between 1908 and 1915. Built at a cost of $2.1 million, it was the largest poured-concrete structure in the country until supplanted by the Pentagon. Patients sometimes staged dramatic protests against the conditions of their confinement, and frequently escaped (more than 300 escapes by 1978). Conditions improved significantly after 1974 as a result of a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of the patients. In a landmark ruling, US District Judge Nicholas J. Walinski spelled out detailed requirements for assuring each patient&#x27;s rights to &quot;dignity, privacy and human care&quot;. In its last years, the state hospital was used for the filming of a made-for-television movie about the Attica Prison riots in New York. Starting in 1982, Lima State Hospital became a medium-security prison, the Lima Correctional Institution. The prison closed in 2004, though a smaller prison on the site, the Allen Correctional Institution, remains.

Founded in 1906, the Lima Rescue Mission offers support and daily necessities for unhoused and needy individuals in Lima and wider Allen County.

<text>Ashland is a city in and the county seat of Ashland County, Ohio, United States. The population was 19,225 at the 2020 census. It is the center of the Ashland Micropolitan statistical area, which includes all of Ashland County.

==History==
Ashland was laid out by William Montgomery in 1815. Ashland was originally called Uniontown, but in 1822 the city was compelled to adopt a new name because another city in Ohio was already named Uniontown. The new name of Ashland was selected by supporters of the Kentucky congressman Henry Clay, from Ashland, his estate near Lexington. Later, &quot;Henry Clay High School&quot; was considered as a name for what is now known as Ashland High School.

In the mid-1800s, Ashland pioneers traveled to Oregon, naming a settlement after the town. In 1878, with financial assistance from the city, the German Baptist Brethren Church opened Ashland College. Ashland became an early center of manufacturing in Ohio. In 1870, brothers Francis E. Myers and Philip A. Myers went into business selling farm equipment and operating a repair shop. They secured the patent for a double-action pump that delivered water in a steady stream rather than spurts. By 1915, F.E. Myers &amp; Bro. had 800 workers. Myers was the largest of the 47 factories in Ashland at that time. Other factories included Reliable Match Co. (&quot;Strike Anywhere Matches&quot;), Kauffman Mfg. Co. (manufacturer of folding chairs used in Union Army encampments), Dr. Hess &amp; Clark (veterinary supplies and disinfectants) and T.W. Miller&#x27;s Faultless Rubber Co. (rubber sundries, surgical goods and bicycle tires).

In 1912, Harry Ross Gill, an Ashland native, invented the way to make cigar-shaped balloons (until then they were only round). He started the Eagle Rubber Company in 1913 and the National Latex company in 1929. The industry that Gill developed in Ashland led to the city becoming known as &quot;the balloon capital of the world.&quot; Ashland still celebrates its balloon heritage with its annual BalloonFest.

Ashland was designated a Tree City USA by the National Arbor Day Foundation in 1984.

<text>Jeromesville is a village in Ashland County, Ohio, United States. The population was 531 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Jeromesville was platted in 1815 ( near the site of a former and abandoned Native-American village named &quot;Jerometown&quot;). It is named for Jean/John Baptiste Jerome, (a French-Canadian fur trader and pioneer settler), from whom, Christian Deardorf and William Vaughn purchased land and &#x27;founded&#x27; a new pioneer village, (which was originally spelled &quot;Jeromeville&quot;). A post office has been in operation at Jeromesville since 1816. [Note: the Native-American village of Jerometown is often attributed to be the same as &quot;Mohican Johnstown&quot;; however, the mid-1700s village named &quot;Mohican Johnstown&quot; was not at this same location.(see Lenape settlements)]

In 2018, Mayor Randy Spade founded the Jeromesville Junior Council, an advisory group consisting of 5th through 8th graders attending Hillsdale Local School District.

==Education==
Perrysville is part of the Loudonville-Perrysville Exempted Village School District and was home to Perrysville Junior High until 2012, when the school was closed and the school merged with Loudonville High School.

Public schooling in Perrysville began in 1816 with the construction of the first schoolhouse, taught by Asa Brown on what was then a farm. For the previous two years, education had been offered in private homes by Betsy Rice Coulter and then by William Maxwell Adolphus Johnson. During this time, school was taught only during the summer because of transportation limitations.

On November 14, 1865, an academy opened in Perrysville. At the time, academies served as a popular source of higher learning that was a step above traditional public schooling but a step below formal colleges. This school, located in what is now a Presbyterian church, taught a class of 45 enrolled students, although only 11 attended. In 1869 a separate building was built for the academy, and it operated there for twenty-six years. In 1895, the building burned down, and Greentown Academy never re-opened.

The second Perrysville schoolhouse was built in 1871 on West Third Street. The building later housed Jones Piano and a cigar factory. Eleven years later, in 1882, the third schoolhouse was built down the street from the second one.

Built in 1924, the fourth and last schoolhouse stood for many years. When it was built, students from schools all over Green Township left those schools to attend Perrysville High School. The building was remodeled in 1955. The school colors were red and white and the mascot was an Admiral in honor of the town&#x27;s namesake, Oliver Hazard Perry. The school was successful in athletics, with seven notable teams between 1926 and 1952 - one women&#x27;s basketball team, four men&#x27;s basketball teams, a men&#x27;s baseball team, and a men&#x27;s football team.

The town continued to operate independent schools for 145 years until it merged with the Loudonville, Ohio school district in 1961. In 1961, the last class graduated from Perrysville High School. At this time, the Loudonville and Perrysville schools merged into the Loudonville-Perrysville Exempted Village School District in order to prevent the schools from closing down permanently. In 1988, what had been Perrysville High School became Perrysville Junior High. The current Perrysville Junior High School served as the home of grades K-12. Perrysville School District competed in a variety of varsity sports, including football, with the mascot of &quot;The Admirals&quot;, an homage to the town&#x27;s namesake Commodore Perry.

<text>Ashtabula ( ) is the most populous city in Ashtabula County, Ohio, United States. It lies at the mouth of the Ashtabula River, on Lake Erie, northeast of Cleveland. At the 2020 census, the city had 17,975 people. Like many other cities in the Rust Belt, it has lost population because of a decline in industrial jobs since the 1960s. It is part of the Cleveland metropolitan area.

In the middle of the 19th century, the city was an important destination on the Underground Railroad as refugee slaves took ships across Lake Erie to Canada. In the late 19th century, the city became a major coal port on Lake Erie. Coal and iron were shipped here, the latter from the Mesabi Range in Minnesota. The city attracted immigrants from Finland, Sweden, and Italy in the industrial period. Ashtabula hosts an annual Blessing of the Fleet Celebration, usually in late May or early June. As part of the celebration, a religious procession and prayer service is held at Ashtabula Harbor. The city was the site of the FinnFestUSA in 2007, a celebration of Finnish Americans.

== History ==

This area had long been inhabited by indigenous peoples. After the American Revolutionary War, the United States mounted the Northwest Indian War to push Native American peoples out of what it then called the Northwest - the area of the Midwest south of the Great Lakes and west of the Appalachian Mountains. The success of this military effort resulted in more European Americans entering Ohio and nearby territories.

The site of Ashtabula was settled by such European Americans beginning in 1803. The city was incorporated in 1891. Located directly on Lake Erie and developed as a port for trade, the city contained several stops on the Underground Railroad. This informal, secret system was the means by which anti-slavery supporters helped escaped African-American slaves reach freedom in Canada in the years before the American Civil War. While Ohio was a free state, many refugee slaves still felt at risk of slavecatchers here, particularly after the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 was passed. It required enforcement and cooperation by residents of free states to return escaped slaves and was biased toward slavecatchers, requiring little documentation of their claims. Among the Underground Railroad sites in Ashtabula is Hubbard House, one of the handful of former surviving termination points. Refugee slaves stayed in a basement of the house adjacent to the lake and then left on the next safe boat to Canada, gaining their freedom once they arrived in Ontario.

The city&#x27;s harbor has been important as a large ore and coal port since the end of the 19th century, and integral to the steel manufacturing that was developed around the Great Lakes. Lake steamers and barges, built at shipyards along the Great Lakes and setting new records for size and tonnage, delivered cargoes of iron ore from the Mesabi Range in Minnesota. This continues as a coal port; a long coal ramp is visible in the harbor. Ore shipments are unloaded from &#x27;lakers&#x27; (Great Lakes freighters) and shipped to surviving steel mills in Pennsylvania. Industrial jobs have declined since the late 20th century with much steel manufacturing moved offshore.

An electric street railroad was built by Captain John N. Stuart in 1883. However, in July 1890, the city council dispossessed him of the street railroad and associated franchises via a disputable court decision. Shortly after, 600-700 men started to tear up and remove the tracks under the cover of darkness.

Many European immigrants, particularly from Finland, Sweden, and Italy, were attracted to the industrial jobs in Ashtabula in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as they could learn and accomplish tasks without having a great command of English. Ethnic rivalries among these groups were once a major influence on politics and daily life in Ashtabula.

In 1915, Ashtabula became the first city in the United States to adopt a form of voting called proportional representation. This was an addition to the council-manager charter, originally passed in 1914, and served as a model for the National Municipal League. Twenty-four more cities would go on to use this single-transferable-vote (STV) system, with five in total in Ohio. Ethnic rivalries were one reason for the city&#x27;s switch, as STV enabled minorities to win political office. Another factor was disunity in the incumbent Republican Party. Voters repealed the system in 1929, using it for the last time in 1931. Despite two failed repeal campaigns in 1920 and 1926, political bosses and parties that lost power under STV eventually restored plurality voting, otherwise known as &#x27;winner take all.&#x27;

A substantial percentage of the current residents are descended from those early 20th-century immigrants. The population in the City of Ashtabula grew steadily until 1970 but has declined in recent years due to industrial restructuring and loss of jobs. Since the late 20th century, the city has become a destination for Hispanic or Latino immigrants, who by the 2010 census made up 9.3% of the population. (See &#x27;Demographics&#x27; section below.)

===Tragedies===

Construction of railroads connected Ashtabula to a national network that contributed to its success as a port. On December 29, 1876, one of the nation&#x27;s most notorious rail accidents occurred, known as the Ashtabula River railroad disaster, Ashtabula Horror, or Ashtabula bridge disaster. As Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway Train No. 5, &quot;The Pacific Express,&quot; crossed the Ashtabula River bridge, the Howe truss structure collapsed, dropping the second locomotive and 11 passenger cars into the frozen creek below. A fire was started by the car stoves, and of the 159 people on board, 92 were killed and 64 were injured.

A rail ferry, also named &quot;Ashtabula,&quot; used to run from Ashtabula to Port Burwell, Ontario. The ferry was launched in 1906 and operated successfully for many decades. It collided with the steamer &quot;SS Ben Morell&quot; in September 1959, causing the ferry to sink.

On August 10, 1958, a natural gas leak was ignited by electrical equipment or lighting in Andover, Ohio a neighboring town. The resulting explosion destroyed a restaurant and five other buildings. 21 people were killed, and 15 injured.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, the city has a total area of , of which (or 97.85%) is land and (or 2.15%) is water.

Ashtabula is bordered by Lake Erie to the north and has a prominent harbor where the Ashtabula River flows into the lake. The Ashtabula Harbor was a primary coal harbor and still serves to ship. It has two public beaches: Walnut Beach, near the harbor, and Lake Shore Park, originally a Public Works Administration project during the Great Depression, on the opposite side of the harbor.

Part of the city lies in Ashtabula Township, and part lies in Saybrook Township.

The Ashtabula area receives a considerable amount of snow throughout the winter, with the average snowfall being . Much of the snow comes from lake-effect snow bands from the Great Lakes.

==Port==

In the 20th century Ashtabula developed rapidly as a major shipping and commercial center because of its access to Lake Erie and nearly of shoreline.

During the 1950s, the area experienced growth with an expanding chemical industry and increasing harbor activity, making Ashtabula one of the most important port cities of the Great Lakes. Other historical industries in the area included a Rockwell International plant on Route 20 on the western side of Ashtabula, which manufactured brakes for the Space Shuttle program, and the extrusion of depleted and enriched uranium at the Reactive Metals Extrusion plant on East 21st Street.

Due to such industrial uses, however, there was extensive environmental contamination. The Ashtabula River and harbor were designated as a significant Superfund site by the Environmental Protection Agency in the late 20th century. A multi-year process of environmental cleanup of toxic wastes and soils was needed; cleanup concluded with river dredging in 2012–2014.

Ashtabula Harbor hosts an annual &#x27;Blessing of the Fleet&#x27; community festival. This Blessing of the Fleet began as a practice of priests for Catholic Portuguese and Irish fishermen and tugmen who had settled in Ashtabula. During the 1930s, the Blessing was a small, almost private affair in early April conducted by a few tugmen, their parish priest, and an acolyte, according to their traditions. It took place annually when the Great Lakes were free enough of ice to be open for regular traffic. By 1950, this event was held as a public ceremony under the auspices of Mother of Sorrows parish. In 1974, the Blessing of the Fleet became a community affair, with all of Ashtabula&#x27;s religious and harbor community participating.

The United States Coast Guard Station and the Ashtabula Maritime &amp; Surface Transportation Museum, located in the old lighthouse keepers home, help to preserve Ashtabula&#x27;s maritime heritage.

Norfolk Southern used the port for one its coal piers. The coal pier became idled in 2016 due to declining demand for coal.

==In popular culture==
During World War II, the United States Navy used the names of rivers with Indian origins for an entire class of fleet oilers, which are used to replenish vessels while underway at sea. USS &quot;Ashtabula&quot; (AO-51) was commissioned in 1943 and served until 1982. &quot;Ashtabula&quot; was awarded eight battle stars for World War II service, four battle stars for the Korean War, and eight battle stars for duty in the Vietnam War. Partially scrapped in 1995, &quot;Ashtabula&quot; was expended as a target in fleet exercises on October 15, 2000. She has been the only Navy vessel to bear the name &quot;Ashtabula&quot;.

The city is also referenced in Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1975 album &#x27;Blood On The Tracks&#x27;, in the song &#x27;You&#x27;re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go&#x27;.

<doc id="128899" wikidata="Q868777" url="?curid=128899" title="Conneaut, Ohio">
<text>Conneaut ( ) is the northeastern most city in Ashtabula County, Ohio, United States, as well as the entire state as a whole. Located in the Cleveland metropolitan area, it is settled along Lake Erie at the mouth of Conneaut Creek northeast of Cleveland. The population was 12,318 at the 2020 census. 

==History==

Conneaut is located on an old Native American trail, later used by early westbound pioneers. The word &quot;conneaut&quot; comes from the Seneca language, and has a disputed meaning. A Mississauga village was located at or near Conneaut, c. 1747.

<text>Geneva-on-the-Lake is a village in northwestern Ashtabula County, Ohio, United States, along the southern shore of Lake Erie. A small resort town, the population was 916 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Ashtabula micropolitan area, northeast of Cleveland.

==History==

Settlement of the original area known as the Connecticut Western Reserve started in the early 1800s, as investors, farmers, and frontiersmen from New England and the Mid-Atlantic began to farm in the area and capitalize on the natural resources of Lake Erie and its shoreline. Industry along the lake shore continued to develop, including a lime burning business along Cowles Creek on the west, along with small-scale lumber processing and ship building at Indian Creek on the east. In 1869, Cullen Spencer and Edward Pratt purchased property known as Sturgeon Point (now Mapleton Beach) and opened it as a public picnic grounds with beach access. Later, a pony-powered carousel of sorts would be added which later help establish the town as Ohio&#x27;s first summer resort.

In order to accommodate more visitors, residents built and established boarding houses and inns; the first being what is now the Jennie Munger Gregory Museum. Vacation residences continued to grow and expand through the early 1900s to include places such as the Idle-A-While and Shady Beach Inn. Erieview Park was started in 1945 by E.M. &quot;Pop&quot; Pera, and it grew to include nine adult and nine children&#x27;s amusement park rides including The Fright Zone, one of three scary dark rides created by the Allen Herschel Co. The park closed in 2006, but the Ferris wheel and carousel are still in operation nearby. Starting in 1964 with the purchase of Chestnut Grove, portions of land which were to become the Geneva-on-the-Lake State Park continued to grow through 1974 to include cabins, campgrounds, and a swimming beach.

<text>Jefferson is a village in and the county seat of Ashtabula County, Ohio, United States. The population was 3,226 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Ashtabula micropolitan area, northeast of Cleveland.

Modern-day Jefferson sports the world&#x27;s only perambulator museum and a historical complex including several restored 19th-century buildings. Joshua Giddings&#x27; law office has also been restored as a museum. Annual village events include the Ashtabula County Fair, the Strawberry Festival, Jefferson Days, and the Covered Bridge Festival.

==History==

Jefferson was officially founded by Gideon Granger, U.S. Postmaster General during Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s administration, in 1803. He envisioned the new settlement as a &quot;Philadelphia of the West,&quot; and early plans for the village were based upon the layout of that city. A cabin was erected by Granger&#x27;s agent in 1804, but the settlement&#x27;s first permanent residents arrived only in 1805: the Samuel Wilson family. Wilson, misled by land agents, moved to Ohio in late autumn expecting to find a thriving city on Granger&#x27;s land. Instead, he found a wilderness, broken only by trees emblazoned with Philadelphian street names, marking where future streets would be built. Wilson himself died after two weeks of herculean effort to prepare for the winter, but his family stayed on as the first citizens of Jefferson. In 1811, Jefferson was made the county seat of Ashtabula County.

Jefferson&#x27;s two most famous sons were Congressman Joshua Reed Giddings and Senator Benjamin Wade, two prominent Whig Party and later Republican Party abolitionists. In 1831, the two men formed a law practice in Jefferson and worked together until Giddings was elected to Congress in 1838. Wade successfully ran for the Ohio State Senate in 1837, then won election to the US Senate in 1851. Both were instrumental in the foundation of the Republican Party and defied the &quot;Gag Rule&quot; barring discussion of slavery prior to the American Civil War. Jefferson itself was a hotbed of abolitionism. Abolitionist John Brown spoke in the village, and several of its houses acted as stations on the Underground Railway. During the American Civil War, it trained Union recruits at Fort Giddings, which stood in the village at the current site of the fairgrounds. Wade later was merely one vote shy of assuming the acting Presidency due to the impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson.

<text>Albany is a village in Athens County, Ohio, United States. The population was 917 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

== History ==
Albany was laid out in about 1832. It was incorporated as a village in 1842.

The small rural village became one of several stops in Athens County for the Underground Railroad, as fugitives could come upriver on the Hocking River from the Ohio River. Free blacks, many of whom had migrated from the Upper South to escape its discrimination, also settled the village in the mid-19th century.

The black population increased during the 1850s from four in the township to 174 by 1860. In 1860, 70 members of the black community were from the South: 53 from Virginia and 17 from other slave states.

=== African American education in Albany ===
Although Ohio laws made attending public schools difficult for African-American children, private schools in Albany offered educational opportunities to them that were unavailable in most parts of the state.

In 1848, William S. Lewis founded the Lewis Academy, which admitted students regardless of race or gender. Lewis&#x27;s admission policies were influenced by the liberal ideals of Oberlin College, which he had attended as a student.

In 1850, a joint-stock company took over administration of Lewis Academy, and the name was changed to the Albany Manual Labor Academy, and then later to the Albany Manual Labor University (AMLU). The school continued to admit students of all genders and races. Slaveholders were not permitted to become shareholders. Students with financial need could borrow money from the institution and repay their tuition by working two hours a day in the manual labor department: farming land owned by the school, operating the school&#x27;s saw-mill, or making bricks.

The academy&#x27;s constitution stated that the institution&#x27;s primary goal was:... to break down, so far as our influence shall extend, the oppressive distinctions on account of caste and color, and counteract, both by example and precept, a spirit of aristocracy, that is spreading itself throughout the land.
The constitution also required that one woman and one African American sit on the board. Philip Clay, a former slave from Virginia who was a successful shoemaker in Albany, was one of the first members of the board. Notable Ohio abolitionists served as trustees and board members, including John Brown, an Albany merchant and activist with the Underground Railroad, and Salmon P. Chase, twice U.S. Senator from Ohio, Governor of Ohio and future Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

AMLU had its peak enrollment of 284 students in 1857, but suffered financial problems. In 1862, a denominational church group, Albany&#x27;s Free Will Baptists, took over management of the school. They ended the admission of African Americans. The outbreak of the Civil War resulted in a decline in the number of students, and the academy closed.

To ensure the education of their children, African Americans from the county and state founded the private Albany Enterprise Academy in 1862. It was the first school in Athens County founded exclusively by and for African Americans. It operated until 1886. Founders included leaders of the black community such as Thomas Jefferson Furguson (co-founder of the Ohio Colored Teacher&#x27;s Association, member of the Albany City Council, and the first black to serve on a jury in Athens County), Cornelius Berry (father of Edward Berry of the Berry Hotel), Philip Clay, David Norman, Woodrow Wiley, and Jackson Wiley. A two-story building was constructed and the school opened in 1864, with 49 students already enrolled.

In 1864, the board advertised their academy in a broadsheet, saying:
The School will be owned and managed by colored persons; but this does not in our opinion make an argument against it.
&lt;br&gt;
The day has gone by for the colored man to be used as a mere machine. He must now reflect the light of his own intellectual and moral development, must either shine in the effulgence of his own wisdom, or sink to poverty and wretchedness by his own ignorance.

The Enterprise Academy had in &quot;excess of one hundred students&quot; in its early years of operation (for comparison, about the same number then enrolled at Ohio University at the same time). With the increase in students, a second building for a girl&#x27;s dormitory was built in 1870. By the late 1870s, many blacks had left the area for work in larger cities and local public integrated schools were available. As a result, the Enterprise Academy suffered declining enrollment; it closed in 1886.

===May 1911 Fire===

In the predawn hours of May 2, 1911, one of the most disastrous fires to ever happen in the village destroyed an entire block in downtown Albany. Six stores, a hotel, and several residences burned to the ground. A strong wind helped the fire grow throughout the wood-framed structures. Within just an hour and a half all of the buildings on that side of Main Street were destroyed except for the post office and telephone building. The heat was so intense that buildings across the street were threatened and many windows were broken. Scores of men worked several hours to contain the fire and keep it from spreading further.

14 years earlier the other side of this block burned and most of those buildings were rebuilt with brick structures.

<text>Amesville is a village in Athens County, Ohio, United States, located on Federal Creek. The population was 171 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Amesville was laid out in 1837. The village derives its name from Fisher Ames who was instrumental in gaining federal support for the Ohio Company of Associates which managed much of the settlement in the area.

Amesville is perhaps best known for the Coonskin Library. At an 1803 town meeting—held to discuss roads—settlers talked about their desire for books and their lack of money to pay for them. Most of the business was done by barter, so little money was in circulation. However, the surrounding forest had pelts that could be sold in the East to buy books. In the spring of 1804, Samuel B. Brown was given the pelts and, accompanied by Ephraim Cutler, went east to bring back books for the town. Fifty-one books—mostly on religion, travel, biography and history—were purchased for $73.50. These books were passed from home to home until Ephraim Cutler was elected librarian in 1804.
The original books can be found at the Ohio Historical Society, as well as Ohio University&#x27;s Alden Library. A commemorative marker, placed by the Nabby Lee Ames D.A.R. Chapter of Athens in 1925, is located near the Community Bank on State Street. The Coonskin Library Museum opened in May 1994 in the former cafeteria of the Amesville Grade School.

A post office called Amesville was established 1820.

===Mayor Alonzo Weed===
Another unique feature of Amesville history was the election of Alonzo Weed as mayor in 1903. Research by Tyler Buchanon, of the Athens Messenger, tells the story of a wandering hobo that became mayor of the village. Alonzo Weed was likely born somewhere on the west coast around 1850. Amesville residents found Weed a strange, but friendly figure. It&#x27;s hard to say for sure what first prompted his name to get placed on the ballot. In many versions, he was nominated by a few friends on Election Day as a joke.

One way or another, Weed&#x27;s name was indeed placed on the mayoral ballot of April 1903. The election ended in a tie. Weed and Gibson both received exactly 21 votes. Weed was sworn in as the new mayor of Amesville after a tie-breaker. He proved to be unqualified for the job. He was an alcoholic in a dry town, a drifter with little appreciation or experience with municipal government.

Eventually, Alonzo left town, but not after becoming the center of news stories all across the country.

===June 1998 Flood===
On June 28, 1998, a storm front stalled over Federal Creek and dropped over 10 inches of rain. Quickly, Federal Creek rose beyond its banks and crossed State Street and Main Street. It reached a depth of 15 feet at the restaurant on the corner of those two roads. When the water receded it had devastated most of the businesses and houses on the south side of the village. The majority of these buildings were demolished (through FEMA grants) and the resulting open land became Gifford Park. 

===21st century===
In 2007 Amesville became the first village in Ohio to pioneer a new, aerobic wastewater treatment system. The village had been grappling with the waste-water issue since at least 1959, when a village ordinance was passed addressing the question, following the contamination of some wells by sewage.&quot; The Appalachian Regional Commission awarded a $750,000 grant to the Athens County Commissioners for the project, with the county providing $216,320 in local funds according to a press release from U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown’s office. Athens County Commissioner Chris Chmiel said local funds will be provided through the county’s American Recovery Plan Act dollars.&quot;

==Geography==
Amesville is situated in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, approximately 45 miles south by southeast of the terminal moraine, a topographical feature often associated with the boundaries of glaciers, and is surrounded by wooded hills, narrow valleys, and numerous creeks flanked by lowland pastures and farmland.

These features are largely indicative of the areas in the State of Ohio that fall to the south of the terminal moraine. The terminal moraine in the State of Ohio, and to the north of Amesville, effectively serves to bisect the state along a line running on a west to east axis across the south by southeastern third of Ohio thereby contributing to certain distinctive topographical, socio-economic, and cultural attributes on either side of this feature.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Amesville has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<doc id="128917" wikidata="Q998468" url="?curid=128917" title="Nelsonville, Ohio">
<text>Nelsonville is a city in northwestern Athens County, Ohio, United States, located about southeast of Columbus. The population was 5,373 at the 2020 census. It is home to Hocking College as well as Rocky Brands. Nelsonville is surrounded by Ohio&#x27;s only national forest, the Wayne National Forest.

==History==
First settled in 1814 by the Daniel Nelson, Nelsonville was incorporated in 1838 with Charles Cable as its first mayor. Nelsonville blossomed into a classic Appalachian town by the mid-19th century, relying on the extractive industries of coal, clay and salt. Like many large mining towns, Nelsonville was home to a large hotel, The Dew House, and a thriving theater, Stuart&#x27;s Opera House, both located on the Public Square.

During the American Civil War&#x27;s famed Morgan&#x27;s Raid, Confederate cavalry under Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan paused in Nelsonville in July 1863 and burned ten wooden canal boats. However, the 400 confederates failed to destroy a covered bridge over the Hocking Canal when citizens rushed to extinguish the blaze after the raiders rode off. This allowed Union cavalry to continue their pursuit of the fleeing Confederates when they arrived in Nelsonville two hours later. Upon arriving in town, the Union cavalry was delighted that the townspeople had prepared a feast for them.

In 1888, Nelsonville became the first city in the United States west of the Allegheny Mountains to have citywide electric street lights. 

Nelsonville was admitted into the national Main Street Program and named a Preserve America Community. The central business district has also been placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and both the Dew House and Stuart&#x27;s Opera House have been listed separately. Nelsonville was home to a number of companies that used the area&#x27;s dense clay to produce many different types of bricks, particularly glazed paving bricks, some with a distinctive star pattern. Many of the sidewalks in the public square and historic district contain these bricks. In more recent years, its main industrial base was the Rocky Shoes &amp; Boots factory, which has since moved out of the country, but continues to maintain the new Rocky Gear Store, set in the renovated, original factory next to Rocky Brands corporate offices.

==Geography==
Nelsonville is located along the Hocking River; Monday Creek flows through the eastern part of the city. One of the main streets, Canal Street, is located over where the old Hocking Canal once ran.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Nelsonville is located on U.S. Route 33. A bypass was completed in December 2013 for the city.

==Demographics==

At the 2020 census, Nelsonville&#x27;s population was initially counted as 4,612. This would cause the community to adopt a village form of government per section 703.01(A) of the Ohio Revised Code. However, the count was revised to 5,373 after being challenged by city administration.

As of the census of 2010, there were 5,392 people, 1,969 households, and 920 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 2,257 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 94.2% White, 2.8% African American, 0.5% Native American, 0.3% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.4% from other races, and 1.7% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.4% of the population.

There were 1,969 households, of which 25.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 26.4% were married couples living together, 14.7% had a female householder with no husband present, 5.7% had a male householder with no wife present, and 53.3% were non-families. 36.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.24 and the average family size was 2.96.

The median age in the city was 25.1 years. 17.4% of residents were under the age of 18; 32.4% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 24.4% were from 25 to 44; 16.7% were from 45 to 64; and 9% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the village was 54.8% male and 45.2% female.

==Tourism==
Nelsonville&#x27;s Public Square, adorned with local Star Bricks, is home to several shops, restaurants, business offices and financial institutions (Nelsonville First National Bank, Nelsonville Home &amp; Savings, Foundation for Appalachian Ohio). Stuart&#x27;s Opera House, built in 1879, is Ohio&#x27;s last remaining fully operating 2nd story opera house, and is located on the Nelsonville&#x27;s Public Square. Stuart&#x27;s hosts over 75 events a year including: the Annual Nelsonville Music Festival, concerts, plays, films, art and more. Several theater groups perform at Stuart&#x27;s, including the local Athenian Berean Community (ABC) Players. The opera house also offers private events for weddings, receptions and special community events. The Dew Hotel is also located on the Public Square. The former hotel has a noted balcony where President William Howard Taft, President William McKinley, President Warren G. Harding and President Theodore Roosevelt all campaigned.

Rocky Brands was founded in Nelsonville in 1932 as the Wm. Brooks Co. and the corporate headquarters are still located in the city. The former shoe factory now serves as the Rocky Outdoor Gear Store, and features three floors of outerwear, clothing, home interiors, specialty food products and boots.

The Nelsonville Cross was erected on Kontner&#x27;s Hill in April, 1973. It is a Memorial Cross to Mrs. Elizabeth Smith Schwartz by her husband Mr. Walter L. Schwartz. Mr. Schwartz wanted to honor his wife by sharing their faith with their hometown, where they grew up together and later married. The body of the cross is 4.5 feet by 4.5 feet, the cross arm is 25 feet in length and the body is 65 feet tall, anchored to a base of concrete which rises 8 feet above the hilltop. Manufactured of metal of special composition which includes steel and aluminum, it bears a porcelain white color. Newspapers in all parts of America and Europe have carried photographs of it as the &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Metal Cross&quot;, illuminated at night. Nelsonville has received much publicity from its location.
The Brick Kiln Park is located on the grounds of the former Nelsonville Brick Company. In the 19th century, the Hocking Valley was known for its abundance of natural resources, particularly clay. Numerous brick companies began to form after the iron furnaces went out of blast. One of the first to emerge was the Nelsonville Brick Company. In 1877, the Nelsonville Brick Company began their extensive operation. The Nelsonville Block, Hallwood Block, Hocking Block, and the Star Brick were all manufactured by them. In 1880, more kilns and stacks were constructed as an expansion. Nearly twenty-five million blocks and bricks were manufactured each year to keep up with the high demand. The railroads stayed busy transporting their products throughout the Midwest. The blocks and bricks manufactured in Nelsonville were very popular. One of them in particular was known as the king of all pavers, the Nelsonville Block. The salt glazed surface not only made it watertight, it also gave it a distinct and attractive finish. In 1904, the Nelsonville Block won first prize at the World&#x27;s Fair in St. Louis. The Great Depression, combined with the use of concrete, led to the demise of the Nelsonville Brick Company. In 1937, the plant closed down. Although the main plant is gone, a few kilns and stacks, which were part of the expansion in 1880, still remain. An effort is underway to save the remaining kilns and stacks.

Hocking College provides several tourist opportunities in Nelsonville. One stop at Hocking is Robins Crossing, a restored pioneer village located on both the Hocking Valley Scenic Railway train route and the Hockhocking Adena Bikeway. This collection of restored log cabins showcases pioneer life, and includes a general store, school house, and a blacksmith&#x27;s shop. During the warm season, demonstrations are performed at Robins Crossing on most Saturdays and Sundays, and the Hocking Valley Scenic Railway is available to experience the village.

The Hockhocking Adena Bikeway, an long bicycle path, connects Nelsonville with the county seat of Athens. The Nelsonville portion of the bikeway runs from the Inn at Hocking Technical College to the Nelsonville Public Square district. It is designed for walking, running, biking, cross-country skiing, skating, and wheelchairs.

The Hocking Valley Scenic Railway began as part of the historic Hocking Valley Railway in the early 1870s. Today, the railway offers scenic excursions from Nelsonville to Logan, traversing the Hocking Hills. Known for their specialty trains, the Hocking Valley Scenic Railway hosts thousands of passengers each year. Seasonal train rides include: Easter Train, Robbery Trains, North Pole Express, Fall Foliage Trips, Haunted Hills Train, Santa Train, Caboose Train, Great Hocking Valley Train Pull, dinner and wine trains. During World War II, the original Hocking Valley Railroad ran 138 steam locomotives, 70 passenger cars and 15,000 freight cars along 340 route-miles of track. Today, the trains of the Hocking Valley Scenic Railway again pull out of Nelsonville, for pleasure this time, to take passengers on leisurely glides through beautiful, Southeastern Ohio.
Two train rides depart from the railroad depot at U.S. Rt. 33 and the Hocking Parkway Drive on Saturdays and Sundays, Memorial Day Weekend through the end of October, in addition to the seasonal train rides. The Nelsonville Yards were once the busiest railroad yards in the entire state of Ohio.

Adventure Pro Outdoors founded in 2020 provides several opportunities for adventure in Nelsonville. The outfitter offers canoeing, kayaking, tubing, Guided UTV tours, Polaris slingshot rentals, a primitive camp, and retail gear shop. Previously known as &quot;Murray&#x27;s Landing&quot;, the outfitter is known for adrenaline tours and fun tubing events that bring hundreds of visitors each summer. The activities offer scenic views due to operating in the Wayne National Forest &amp; on the Hocking River. Most activities operate during the warmer months of April-October, though UTV tours go into mid December dependent on the Wayne National Forest season dates. 

The Wayne National Forest, the only national forest in Ohio, surrounds the city of Nelsonville. The Wayne National Forest is a patchwork of public land that covers over a quarter million acres of Appalachian foothills of southeastern Ohio. The Forest is divided into three units managed out of two Ranger District offices located in Nelsonville and Ironton, with a field office in Marietta. The forest headquarters are located just outside the city limits on US Route 33, overlooking the Hocking River. It includes Ohio&#x27;s largest collection of ATV trails. Tourist activities include: hiking, canoeing, mountain biking, ATV riding, and bird watching.

<text>The Catahoula Leopard Dog is an American dog breed named after Catahoula Parish, Louisiana. It became the state dog of Louisiana in 1979. It is recognized by the United Kennel Club under the name &quot;Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog&quot;, while the American Kennel Club Foundation Stock Service calls it &quot;Catahoula Leopard Dog&quot;. Both registries have assigned the breed a herding designation, although it has traditionally been used in hunting feral boars.

==History==

The Catahoula lineage was started when Hernando de Soto bred his mastiffs and greyhounds with the native red wolf creating a wolfdog, and then in the mid-1700s, French settlers crossbred those dogs with Beauceron dogs.

On July 9, 1979, in recognition of the historic significance of the Catahoula cur to the State of Louisiana, Governor Edwin Edwards signed House Bill #75 officially naming the Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog as the state dog. On January 1, 1995, the Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog was recognized by the United Kennel Club. In 1996, the AKC added the Catahoula Leopard Dog into their Foundation Stock Service.

==Appearance==
Though physical characteristics are varied, Catahoulas are usually muscular dogs with a rectangular-shaped body. They tend to have a large head with drop ears and a strong, slightly tapered muzzle. They tend to have a thick muscular neck and a long, curved tail. They come in many colors and have medium/short hair.


Catahoulas come in many different colors, including blue merle, red merle, brindle, and solid colors. Often, solid coat Catahoulas have small splashes of other colors such as white on their face, legs or chest. The leopard-like coat of most Catahoulas is the result of the merle gene. The merle gene does not normally affect the entire coat of the dog, but dilutes the color only in areas that randomly present the characteristic of the gene. Deeper colors are preferred; predominantly white coats are discouraged. Since Catahoula is a working dog, coat color is not a primary consideration.

The Catahoula has a single smooth short or coarse medium coat. The short looks almost painted. The medium can have extended &quot;feathering&quot; on the hind legs, tail, and chest.

The breed may have any eye color or combination of colors including blue, brown, green, or amber.

==Work==

The Catahoula was initially used for hunting. Native Americans tended to use the dog for hunting large game. European settlers used the dog for hunting and herding livestock. The first white settlers in Louisiana are believed to have used the dog to hunt feral pigs in the swamps of Louisiana.

Catahoulas are used as bay dogs, tree dogs, and for hunting a variety of wild game, including small game such as raccoons and squirrels, as well as big game such as deer, mountain lions and bear. They are also used for scent trailing game, and as a search and rescue dog.

Catahoulas have a natural herding instinct and a unique way of working a herd. AKC describes it as creating a “canine fence” around the herd which allows the dog&#x27;s master to work the herd within that circle. Herding ability and a natural working instinct are a top priority to Catahoula breeders, over and above a dog&#x27;s appearance. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Catahoulas exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in cow/hog dog trials.

== Health ==
It has been suggested that deafness and blindness from double merle may be rarer in Catahoulas than in other dog breeds.

<text>New Bremen ( ) is a village in Auglaize County, Ohio, United States. The population was 3,034 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Wapakoneta, Ohio Micropolitan Statistical Area. The village is adjacent to Minster to the south.

The village was founded by German immigrants in 1833 and is named after Bremen. It is home to the Bicycle Museum of America. New Bremen is also the world headquarters of Crown Equipment Corporation.

==History==
The town was first a farming community started by Bavarians and Hanoverians, following a route from Bremen, Germany to America, through West Virginia and along the Ohio River to Cincinnati. Once Cincinnati was reached the founders formed a group called the City of Bremen Society, which drew up a charter among its 33 members. This charter authorized the purchase of 80 acres of Ohio land to build a town. Land within German Township was first established as a farming community in 1832, and by 1833 the plat of Bremen was recorded with 102 shares of land to be given away by lottery.

A village was established, but growth had been stunted by lack of accessible markets, and malaria. Transportation through swampy terrain was slow and expensive compared to other areas. This all would change with the completion of the Miami and Erie Canal. There were so few in the town that subcontractors had to rely on &quot;jiggers&quot; or 2oz bottles of whiskey to attract workers. The Canal was soon finished and opened. When opened, the Canal brought new markets to New Bremen, lowering transportation costs thus adding value to agricultural products that before the canal had little cash value. Increased potential profitability also lowered the risks of additional investments. The town became a busy place very quickly, with hundreds of freight boats moving frequently, along with dozens of passenger boats filled with people making the trip from Cincinnati. The locks from the Canal have been restored, along with the addition of a lock keeper&#x27;s house and can be seen in New Bremen&#x27;s downtown area.

==Geography==

The southern edge of New Bremen is the most southern point of the St. Lawrence River Basin which covers an area of 519,000 sq. miles. This feat is achieved by being the headwaters of the St. Mary&#x27;s River, which is a tributary of the Maumee River. The Maumee River and basin (8316 sq miles) is the largest and most southern tributary of Lake Erie and any of the Great Lakes.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

These immigrants became the ancestors of large numbers of residents of New Knoxville and the surrounding area, including Washington Township/Wapakoneta native Neil Armstrong. Closer relations between the two villages have been fostered by journeys by residents of both communities to the other.

<text>St. Marys is a city in Auglaize County, Ohio, United States. Located in western Ohio, it is west of Wapakoneta and east of the Ohio–Indiana border. Founded in 1823, the city is located on a portage between the St. Marys and Auglaize river systems, which was a significant factor in its development before the era of canals. The population was 8,397 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Wapakoneta micropolitan area.

==History==
After the Revolutionary War, the Shawnee village on the site became known as Girty&#x27;s Town for the Indian traders James and Simon Girty, who had a trading post on the site. James Girty was originally a partner of Peter Loramie, but fled to the St. Marys River when Loramie&#x27;s trading post was burned in 1782. Girty maintained his trading post between 1783 and 1790 and fled when General Harmar&#x27;s army approached. He later returned to the post. When General Anthony Wayne approached the St. Marys area in 1794, James Girty packed up his goods and fled to Canada, thus ending the Girty Brothers era in Ohio. The village retained the name until the modern town was founded in 1823.

When General Wayne returned through the St. Marys area late in 1794 after the Battle of Fallen Timbers, he found the site deserted but noted its strategic location as a portage between the St. Mary&#x27;s River and Auglaize River. He ordered a fort built on the location. Fort St. Mary&#x27;s, named for the nearby river, was built by a detachment under Lieutenant John Michael in Oct. 1795 following the Treaty of Greenville. Lieutenant John Whistler was placed in charge of the garrison.

In 1812, Gen. William Henry Harrison found the fort in ruins, and built a fort named Fort Barbee on an adjacent site. Col. Joshua Barbee was placed in charge of the fort.

St. Marys was the site of the signing of the , and the six treaties comprising Treaty of St. Mary&#x27;s of 1818. The latter treaty secured about a third of the state of Indiana from the Miami and Delaware Indians for the United States. The fort was abandoned shortly afterward.

The earliest settlers arrived in 1820. St. Marys was founded by William Houston and John McCorkle, and Charles Murray, in 1823. They bought of land and laid out the village of 68 lots. The village was incorporated as a town in 1834 and Judge Stacy Taylor was elected its first mayor. The town surpassed the threshold of 5,000 persons and became a city in 1904.

St. Marys was the county seat of Mercer County from 1824 until 1840 when the seat was moved to Celina. After Auglaize County was organized in 1848, St. Marys competed with Wapakoneta for the position as county seat but was ultimately unsuccessful in a controversial countywide election.

Three properties in St. Marys are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the former Fountain Hotel, the Dr. Issac Elmer Williams House and Office, and the former Holy Rosary Catholic Church, which was destroyed one year before it was placed on the Register.

St. Marys is a part of the Tree City USA national program.

In 1748, the French built a trading post (Fort au Glaize, also known as &quot;Wapakoneta Trading Post&quot; or &quot;AuGlaize Trading Post&quot;) about a half-mile northeast of the future site of Wapakoneta. After being re-established in 1760 as &quot;Francis Duchouquet&#x27;s Trading Post,&quot; the British later took over this territory after the French ceded it following defeat in the Seven Years&#x27; War. Neither they nor the later Americans (after independence) built a succeeding fort here. French-Canadian traders later reestablished a trading post at the site in 1784, which was abandoned after the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794.

The city itself was established in the 1780s as a Shawnee settlement called &quot;Waughpaughkonnetta&quot; (possibly derived from the Shawnee word &quot;Wa-po&#x27;kanite,&quot; meaning &quot;the place of white bones&quot;).

<doc id="128933" wikidata="Q1985364" url="?curid=128933" title="Bellaire, Ohio">
<text>Bellaire is a village in Belmont County, Ohio, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 3,870 at the 2020 census, having peaked in 1920. It is part of the Wheeling metropolitan area.

The Bellaire Bridge (now abandoned and closed) was filmed in the 1991 motion picture &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot; The curved railroad viaduct and bridge over the Ohio, the B &amp; O Railroad Viaduct, were featured in the 2010 film &quot;Unstoppable&quot; and is a registered historic structure.

==History==

Mound builders occupied numerous areas along the Ohio River and built complex earthworks. None of their distinctive prehistoric remains has been found within the present-day city limits. The Mingo, Shawnee and Delaware were historic tribes who inhabited the area at the time of European encounter and settlement. The latter were involved in the Northwest Indian Wars after settlement began in the post-Revolutionary War years. Unhappy that the United States had ignored their grievances in the 1789 Treaty of Fort Harmar, the Indians tried to push out the settlers over the next several years.

The first documented European visitors to the Ohio River Valley and this area were French trappers and priests in the early and mid-1700s. They were impressed with the river&#x27;s heavily wooded and hilly shores, and with the abundance of fish and wildlife. The young George Washington had explored and surveyed lands in the Ohio River Valley before the Revolutionary War. After the war, he supported plans to have the federal government make land grants to veterans as payment for their services, in lieu of cash.

The ownership of the land changed hands sporadically, through speculation and conflicts over land deeds. John Rodefer and Jacob Davis purchased a shared majority of land for a village, which they realized in 1834. They surveyed six acres of building lot sites north of what is today Twenty-Seventh Street West toward Belmont Street. They named it Bell Air after Davis&#x27;s former home in Maryland. Soon after, other settlers began to buy lots, and the town began to grow. Jacob Heatherington was the builder of the real House That Jack Built, referring to his Mule Jack who pulled the supplies to build the house to the site. Upon completion of the house, Jacob led Jack through every room of the house to show Jack what it looked like.

The first big boost for growth came with the construction of the Central Ohio Railway in 1853, later absorbed by the Baltimore and Ohio, and the Stone Viaduct Bridge (opened in 1871) that carried it to Wheeling, West Virginia. The B&amp;O reached Wheeling in January 1853, having started construction at Baltimore, Maryland in 1857. It was the means by which the East Coast city, a port on Chesapeake Bay, could connect with western markets and compete with New York City and the Erie Canal. Col. John Sullivan campaigned for the connection from Bellaire. The town was renamed Bellaire by the railroad company.

Bellaire had some strategic importance during the Civil War. Its location on the Ohio River meant that it was on the border between the state of Ohio (pro-Union) and the state of Virginia (voted to secede from the Union). Railroads on both sides of the river added to the strategic significance. For these reasons, Camp Jefferson was established in Bellaire as a military training camp, and was often departure point for Union soldiers using the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to move to the southeast.
Bellaire gained the title of &quot;Glass City&quot; for the period of 1870 to 1885. The area had modern transportation, an energy source, and a skilled workforce. The transportation infrastructure included the Ohio River, the National Road, and railroads, including the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad and the Central Ohio Railroad. Coal was the local energy source, as Belmont County was part of the eastern Ohio coal region. A skilled workforce was located within the region, since glass had been made across the river in Wheeling since the 1820s. Some of the glass-making facilities of the time were Belmont Glass Works, Bellaire Window Glass Company, Rodefer-Gleason Glass Company, Star Glass Works, National Glass Manufacturing Company, Bellaire Goblet Works, Union Window Glass Company, and Enterprise Window Glass Company. In the next decade, the list also included the Bellaire Bottle Company, the Century Glass Company, and the Imperial Glass Company. The discovery of natural gas in the Findlay, Ohio area in the late 1880s drew many manufacturers from Bellaire to the west, where the region around Toledo and Fostoria became the new center for Ohio&#x27;s glass industry.

During the Bituminous Coal Miners&#x27; Strike of 1894, the National Guard was called up to protect the region&#x27;s coal mines, and on June 13, there was a violent clash between strikers and national guard troops just west of town.

===Imperial Glass Museum===
Among dozens of local manufacturers, the Imperial Glass Company, founded in 1901 by Edward Muhleman, a riverman and financier, first made glass in 1904. It specialized in the mass production of attractive and affordable pressed-glass tableware, using continuous-feed melting tanks. One of the largest American handmade glass manufacturers during the 20th century, Imperial also produced blown glass, several lines of art glass, and its trademark &quot;Candlewick&quot; pattern. Bellaire&#x27;s glassmaking era finally ended when the &quot;Big I&quot; closed its door in 1984. The building was razed in 1995. Its diverse products remain highly prized by glass collectors.

The Imperial Glass Museum contains displays of Imperial Glassware, as well as other Bellaire glassware, from the Ohio Valley Glass and Artifacts Museum. The museum is dedicated to the glassware and people who worked at Imperial. The National Imperial Glass (NIG) Collectors Society intends to keep alive the story of Imperial through the museum. Imperial was one of the largest and most diverse of the companies that made up the American handmade glass industry.

<text>Bethesda () is a village in west-central Belmont County, Ohio, United States. The population was 1,211 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Wheeling metropolitan area.

==History==

Bethesda has had three names: Burrs Mills, Fairmount, and Bethesda. When the railroad reached the village in 1852, the Central Ohio Railroad built a station and named it Burr&#x27;s Mills in honor of Merrick S. Burr, who operated a sawmill in the area. In 1855, Burr laid out a village which he called Fairmount because of its high and beautiful location. Prior to that time, there was a store, the Bethesda Methodist Church, and a post office, all located about 2 miles south of the current town on what now CR 26, and the post office was named after the church. The store proprietor was the postmaster and when he moved his store to the town, the post office also was relocated but retained its name. As a result, the town was called Fairmount while the railroad station was Burr&#x27;s Mills and the post office was Bethesda. In the late 1800s, the name of Bethesda was finally chosen for the town. Bethesda was incorporated as a village in 1910.

In 1920, the town contracted with the E. Howard Watch &amp; Clock Company to supply a town clock, which was erected atop the Orrison Cigar Co. building on Main Street and is dedicated to Bethesda&#x27;s World War I veterans. In 2010, the clock was removed from service and placed in storage. Businessman Robert E. Murray, spearheaded the restoration of the clock and established the Murray Family Memorial Plaza, which was dedicated in 2017. The facility and the restored clock are dedicated to military veterans from all services.

<text>The Treaty of Stralsund (, 24 May 1370) ended the Second Danish-Hanseatic War between the Hanseatic League and the Kingdom of Denmark. The Hanseatic League reached the peak of its power by the conditions of this treaty.

The war began in 1361 when Danish king Valdemar Atterdag conquered Scania, Öland, and Gotland with the major Hanseatic town Visby. In 1362, a Hanseatic counterstrike was repelled by the Danish fleet at Helsingborg. This led Hansa to accept a truce culminating in the unfavourable Treaty of Vordingborg, depriving the league of many of its privileges. Unwilling to accept the treaty, the Hanseatic League, which used to be a trade league rather than a political union, raised a fleet through the Confederation of Cologne in 1367 and renewed their Swedish alliances. Valdemar and his Norwegian son-in-law Haakon VI were utterly defeated in the following battles

The treaty was negotiated for Denmark by Drost Henning Podebusk and for the Hanseatic League by the burgomasters Jakob Pleskow of Lübeck and Bertram Wulflam of Stralsund. In the treaty, Visby&#x27;s freedom was reestablished. Furthermore, Denmark had to assure the Hanseatic League of free trade in the entire Baltic Sea. The Danes had to waive taxes on German merchants in Scania as well. This gave the Hanseatic League a monopoly on the Baltic fish trade. The league also gained the right to veto against Danish throne candidates.

<text>Martins Ferry is the most populous city in Belmont County, Ohio, United States. The population was 6,260 as of the 2020 census. Located along the Ohio River across from Wheeling, West Virginia, it is part of the Wheeling metropolitan area.

==History==
Martins Ferry is the oldest European settlement in the state of Ohio, having been settled at least as early as 1779, almost a decade before Marietta. The settlement got its start as a consequence of a land grant to George Mercer of the Ohio Company in 1748 from the British Crown for 200,000 acres in the Ohio Country, a colloquial term for what is now much of Ohio, and western West Virginia and Pennsylvania. The grant called for among other things, establishment of a fort. The grant was for land south of the Ohio River in West Virginia (then Virginia). Settlement was hampered by the outbreak of the French and Indian War. The settlement was named Zanesburg (renamed Wheeling in 1795). The Ohio Company was dissolved in 1779, and claims issued by the Crown became moot after the Revolutionary War. The community across the river was a westward extension of Zanesburg, but at that time, settlement on the west bank of the Ohio River was prohibited by the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, 1768. Through the years, it has been known as Hoglinstown, Mercertown, Norristown (1785), Jefferson (1795), Martinsville (1835), and Martin&#x27;s Ferry (1865).

Squatters from across the Ohio were the earliest settlers. The settlement formed in the shadow of Virginia&#x27;s Fort Fincastle, later renamed Fort Henry on the Virginia side of the Ohio, built in 1774. The town was disbanded a couple of times before becoming established as Norristown in 1785. In 1795, the town of Jefferson was platted by Absalom Martin, one of the city&#x27;s earliest settlers, who operated a ferry there. In 1801, he abandoned his plat when St. Clairsville was selected as the county seat of the newly organized county of Belmont, one of the founding territories of the Northwest Territory.

In 1835, Ebenezer Martin, the son of Absalom Martin, redesigned the town, which he called Martinsville, with a grid system of streets, much of which survives to this day. Martinsville remained an unincorporated settlement for a relatively long time. It was eventually incorporated as a village in 1865 and renamed Martin&#x27;s Ferry for Ebenezer&#x27;s father&#x27;s ferry. It was chartered as a city in 1885, and sometime later the apostrophe was dropped from the city&#x27;s name.

The city developed as an important industrial center during the late 19th century and early 20th century. It became an important rail hub and river port. Over the past 50 years, the town&#x27;s population has decreased significantly as industries have closed or moved elsewhere. Today, the city&#x27;s population is less than half of what it once was.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The town is built on two basic plateaus between a hill and the Ohio River. The lower plateau, along the river, is dominated by a large industrial park, the Martins Ferry Football Stadium, and Ohio State Route 7 (a four-lane traffic artery that runs from north to south across eastern Ohio). The higher plateau, which is the larger of the two, is predominantly residential and commercial, and is home to most of the city&#x27;s residents. It gradually rises to a steep hillside in the west that forms a natural wall.

Directly across the river lies the city of Wheeling, West Virginia, and to the east is the Pennsylvania state line. The city of Columbus is to the west, and Pittsburgh is northeast of the city. On the southern end of town, Martins Ferry is directly connected to the village of Bridgeport.

===Climate===
