<text>Ontario is the largest city in Malheur County, Oregon, United States. It lies along the Snake River at the Idaho border. The population was 11,645 at the 2020 census. The city is the largest community in the region of far eastern Oregon, also known as the Western Treasure Valley.

Ontario is the principal city of the Ontario, OR-ID Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Malheur County in Oregon and Payette County in Idaho.

Ontario is approximately halfway between Portland and Salt Lake City. It is the closest city to the Idaho border along Interstate 84. The city&#x27;s slogan is &quot;Where Oregon Begins&quot;.

==History==

Ontario was founded on 11 June 1883, by developers William Morfitt, Mary Richardson, Daniel Smith, and James Virtue. In March 1884, Richard Welch started a post office for the quarter of Ontario, so named by James Virtue after Ontario, Canada. Two months later Joseph Morton applied for a Morton post office at an island about one mile south of town, with Oscar Scott as postmaster. Unfortunately for Morton and Scott, merchants Morfitt and Richardson of Malheur City, gold miner Virtue, and lumberman Smith of Baker City acquired more land and were better financed. More importantly, Morfitt had negotiated a train depot for Ontario. All the settlers and speculators knew the railroad was coming and how important that would be to Ontario&#x27;s future so Scott closed his Morton post office and built a hotel at present-day Ontario. By December, Scott was Ontario&#x27;s postmaster.

The town continued to grow with the arrival of the Oregon Short Line Railroad in later 1884, and freight and passenger service were added to the town&#x27;s offerings. Soon after, stock began arriving from Eastern Oregon&#x27;s cattle ranches to Ontario&#x27;s stockyard for transshipment to markets throughout the Pacific Northwest. Ontario became one of the largest stockyards in the West. In addition, the construction of the Nevada Ditch and other canals aided the burgeoning agricultural industry, adding those products to Ontario&#x27;s exports.

Ontario was incorporated by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on 11 February 1899.

A city by the time of World War II, Ontario Mayor Elmo Smith allowed Japanese Americans to settle at a time when much of the West Coast supported their exclusion. Smith told the Associated Press &quot;If the Japs, both alien and nationals, are a menace to the Pacific Coast safety unless they are moved inland, it appears downright cowardly to take any other stand than to put out the call, &#x27;Send them along; we&#x27;ll cooperate to the fullest possible extent in taking care of them.&#x27;&quot; A population of about 134 in the city and surrounding county before the war ballooned to 1,000 as the county recruited farm workers during the war.

===Cannabis legalization===
Since 2019, cannabis dispensaries have been an important part of Ontario&#x27;s economy and a notable example of the border effect.

In November 2018, voters overturned a ban on recreational marijuana dispensaries in the town, several years after Oregon legalized recreational marijuana use. As Ontario borders Idaho (where marijuana remains illegal for all purposes), local news outlets reported that by November 2019 the city&#x27;s dispensaries were generating a significant amount of revenue from Idaho residents driving across the state line. Total cannabis sales from Ontario dispensaries topped $100 million in December 2020. The additional revenue from cannabis sales reversed a years-long trend of cutting the annual city budget and stoked advocacy for creation of a Greater Idaho, as many in that part of the state did not vote to legalize recreational marijuana or for the decriminalization of harder drugs along with the more liberal parts of the state, as well as those in Idaho who feel the border purchases of marijuana have increased drug abuse and hurt their way of life there.

<text>Älvkarleby Municipality (&quot;Älvkarleby kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Uppsala County in east central Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Skutskär.

The municipality is one of few in the country which has not been amalgamated since it was created out of a parish when the first local government acts of Sweden were implemented in 1863.

==Localities==
*Gårdskär
*Marma
*Skutskär (seat)
*Älvkarleby

==History==
Not until late in the Bronze Age (10th century BC) did parts of what is now Älvkarleby begin to rise out of the Baltic Sea. Remains of settlements from that period has been found in the area. In the Early Iron Age (6th-12th century) the population began to grow and people supported themselves on farming, hunting, fishing and livestock. The first mention of Älvkarleby is found in documents from the early Middle Ages (13th century).

Älvkarleby was the hometown of the author Stig Dagerman.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Älvkarleby Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 9,614 residents, including 7,312 Swedish citizens of voting age resident in the municipality. 46.4% voted for the left coalition and 52.2% for the right coalition, a stark reversal from previous elections dominated by the Social Democrats. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Elections==
These are the election results since the 1972 municipal reform. The results of the Sweden Democrats were not published by the SCB between 1988 and 1998 due to the party&#x27;s small size nationally so has been denoted as &quot;0.0&quot;. Älvkarleby has traditionally seen outright majorities for the Social Democrats, although in 2010 and 2014 the party fell just short of 50% of ballots cast in the municipality.

===Riksdag===
Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party.

<text>Vale is a city in and the county seat of Malheur County, Oregon, United States, about west of the Idaho border. It is at the intersection of U.S. Routes 20 and 26, on the Malheur River at its confluence with Bully Creek.

This cabin was replaced by the Rinehart House in 1872, which still stands today.

The railroad arrived in Vale in 1883, and the town became an important shipping gateway. A post office with the name of Vale was established in the Rinehart House the same year, though the community was not incorporated by the Oregon Legislative Assembly until February 21, 1889.

<text>Detroit is a city in Marion County, Oregon, United States. It was named for Detroit, Michigan, in the 1890s because of the large number of people from Michigan in the community. The population was 203 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==

The original townsite of Detroit was inundated in the summer of 1952 when the Corps of Engineers finished Detroit Dam on the Santiam River. The community was relocated about northwest of the original site, on Route 22, and was incorporated as a city the same year.

Construction on the concrete Detroit Dam began on April 1, 1949, as part of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; Willamette Valley Project. The completed dam was dedicated by former Oregon Governor Douglas McKay and the U. S. Secretary of the Interior on June 10, 1953. In addition to flood control, the dam benefited navigation, irrigation, electric power production, stream purification and recreation.

Located near Detroit Lake and Detroit Lake State Park, Detroit&#x27;s economy is dependent on tourism. The community suffered from a drought in 2001, when Detroit Lake was little more than the Santiam River through the summer.

In 2010, by a vote of 47–37, citizens in Detroit voted down a ballot measure that would have changed the city&#x27;s name to Detroit Lake, the name of the neighboring reservoir and one of the most visited summer sites in Oregon. The proposal was put forth by Doug DeGeorge, a builder and motel owner who resides in Arizona and wanted to disassociate the town from Detroit, Michigan, and its close ties to &quot;crime, corruption, failing schools, and a shaky auto industry&quot;. DeGeorge was not present on the day of the city council vote, but repercussions from his comments had phone lines flooded with angry calls from Michigan residents. Voters chose to keep the original name of the city, though most residents and tourists still call it Detroit Lake. Gary Brown, a city councilman in Detroit, Michigan, disagreed with the proposal, saying that residents would have made a big mistake because &quot;the Motor City will one day return to its previous glory&quot;.

On September 9, 2020, the entire city of Detroit was mostly burned to the ground during the Santiam Fire. Dozens of people were trapped, but managed to escape on a forest road through the active fire. A few months later, during the February 2021 winter and ice storm, the city received 26 in (66 cm) of snowthe most of any place affected by the storm.

<text>Donald is a city in Marion County, Oregon, United States. The population was 1,009 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. Donald is located along the route of the Oregon Electric Railway.

==History==
Donald has a rich history in agriculture, industry, business and family. Sometime between 1840 and 1860 Donald was settled by farmers and loggers from the Midwest. By the early 1900’s, Donald was a main station for the Oregon Electric Railway. The city was named after R. L. Donald who was an engineer of the construction company that built the railway. Donald was built from Donation Land Claims sold by R. L. Donald to the Donald Town Lot and Land Company in 1908. The original community was centered on agricultural land growing hops. The town grew primarily on the hop crop until the Oregon Electric Railway located a substation and depot in Donald. It was part of the railway mainline between Salem and Portland. The substation was completed in 1906. The post office was established April 13, 1910 and the town was home to the Donald Brick and Tile works from 1911-1923. The completion of paved Highway 99W negatively affected the railway ridership. The electrified passenger service was discontinued through Donald on May 14, 1933. During this time, the population dropped from 300 to 100. In 1947 the railway transitioned to steam power and in 1948 to diesel power. In 1970 the rail line merged into Burlington Northern. The rail line is still heavily used today by the Portland and Western Railroad.

<text>Gervais is a city in Marion County, United States. The population was 2,595 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The city is named for settler Joseph Gervais who was one of the first settlers on French Prairie.

On October 6, 1902, the business district of the city burned and losses were estimated at $100,000. The local fire department&#x27;s power was insufficient to handle the fire so Portland and Salem were called upon to help. Unfortunately they were unable to respond in time to help. In little over an hour all but two of the businesses in the town had burned to the ground.

<text>Keizer () is a city located in Marion County, Oregon, United States, along the 45th parallel. As of the 2020 United States Census, its population was 39,376, making it the 14th most populous city in Oregon. It lies in the Willamette Valley, and is part of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area. It was named after pioneer Thomas Dove (T. D.) Keizur and his family, who arrived in the Wagon Train of 1843, and later filed donation land claims.

==History==
The original settlement was at Keizer Bottom, near the banks of the Willamette River. The community was named after Thomas Dove Keizur, one of its first settlers. Somewhere in the translation of donation land claim records, his name was misspelled.
The settlement suffered in the flood of 1861, and the inhabitants rebuilt their homes on higher ground. Further floods in 1943, 1945, 1946 and 1948 hampered the growth of the community, and it was not until dams were built in the 1950s to regulate the flow of the Willamette that Keizer began to flourish.

The City of Salem tried to annex the growing community adjacent to its city limits many times. Beginning in 1964, a number of Keizer residents, powered by Janet and Richard Bauer and family, tried to convince the people of Keizer that it would be cheaper and better to form their own city. It was not until November 2, 1982, that, with the support of the nearby unincorporated community of Clear Lake, residents voted to make Keizer a city.

Keizer Bottom is now the site of Keizer Rapids Park, a public park whose attractions include a dog park, playground, boat-in camping, nature trails, a disc golf course, and sport courts.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

<text>Mt. Angel or Mount Angel is a city in Marion County, Oregon, United States. It is northeast of Salem, Oregon, on Oregon Route 214. The population was 3,392 at the 2020 census. Mt. Angel is part of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Mt. Angel was originally settled in 1850 by Benjamin Cleaver, who later planned a townsite which he named Roy. In 1881, a railroad station was established and named Fillmore after a railroad official. The following year, a post office with the name of Roy was established, but neither name was to last.

Rev. Fr. Adelhelm Odermatt, O.S.B., came to Oregon in 1881 with a contingent of Benedictine monks from Engelberg, Switzerland, in order to establish a new American daughter house. After visiting several locations, he found Lone Butte to be the ideal location for a new abbey, and shortly afterwards ministered to several local Roman Catholic parishes, about the same time large numbers of immigrants from Bavaria settled in the area. Due to his efforts, the city, post office and the nearby elevation Lone Butte came to be known as Mount Angel (an English translation of Engelberg) in 1883. He also established Mount Angel Abbey, a Benedictine monastery and school, which was moved permanently to Mt. Angel in 1884.

The city of Mt. Angel was incorporated April 3, 1893. The post office of Saint Benedict, Oregon, was established at the Abbey.

Mount Angel Abbey is still located on Mount Angel. The original Kalapuyan name of the butte is Tapalamaho, which translates to &quot;Mount of Communion.&quot; At the request of the Archbishop of Oregon City, the abbey opened Mount Angel Seminary in 1889 for the training of priests. The original wooden buildings at the foot of the butte were destroyed by a fire in the 1890s, and another disastrous fire in 1926 consumed the second monastery, an imposing five-story edifice of black basalt at the top of the butte. The current monastery building was completed in 1928, and subsequent structures followed, including a library built by Finnish architect Alvar Aalto in 1970. A bell tower was added to the abbey church in 2007 which contains eight bells, one of which is the largest swinging bell in the Pacific Northwest.

The Benedictine Sisters of Mt. Angel (the Queen of Angels Monastery) were founded in 1882 and have been serving the Willamette Valley ever since. They teach in schools and parishes; work as counselors, chaplains, and pastoral associates; they are artisans, cooks, and gardeners. As a community, the Benedictine Sisters sponsor two ministries, the Shalom Prayer Center and the St. Joseph Shelter.

<text>Silverton is a city in Marion County, Oregon, United States. The city is situated along the 45th parallel about northeast of Salem, in the eastern margins of the broad alluvial plain of the Willamette Valley. The city is named after Silver Creek, which flows through the town from Silver Falls into the Pudding River, and thence into the Willamette River. The community of Milford was founded in 1846 with a sawmill, store and several other buildings two miles upstream from the present location of Silverton. In about 1853 a second sawmill was built on Silver Creek near where the Silverton city hall now stands. In 1854 the town of Silverton was platted and registered with Marion County. Human habitation of the Silverton area extends back approximately 6,000 years before the present. In historical times, the region was dominated by the Kalapuya and Molala peoples, whose seasonal burns of the area made it plow-ready and attractive to early 19th century Euro-American settlers. Farming was Silverton&#x27;s first major industry, and has been a dominant land-use activity in and around Silverton since the mid-19th century.

Silverton is part of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area, and the population core of the Silver Falls School District. The population was 10,484 at the time of the 2020 census.

==Geography==

Silverton is situated on the eastern edge of the Willamette Valley, a fertile and alluvial plain which stretches from the western foothills of the Cascade Range on the east, known as the Waldo Hills, to the eastern foothills of the Oregon Coast Range on the west. Silverton lies on either side of Silver Creek, a tributary of the Pudding River, which joins the Molalla River before emptying into the northward-flowing Willamette River. Abiqua Creek also empties into the Pudding River; it flows across the eastern valley north of Silverton, further draining the land around the city.

Silverton&#x27;s elevation is between above mean sea level with the steep-sided, heavily-wooded Waldo Hills to the south rising an additional . The agricultural richness of the environs is due to massive and repeated floods from prehistoric Lake Missoula in western Montana. Beginning approximately 13,000 years before the present, repeated flooding from Lake Missoula scoured eastern Washington and Oregon, carved out the Columbia River Gorge, and periodically swept down the Columbia River; when floodwaters met ice jams in southwest Washington, the backed-up water spilled over and filled the entire Willamette Valley to a depth of above current sea level, creating a body of water known as Lake Allison. The gradual receding of Lake Allison&#x27;s waters left layered sedimentary volcanic and glacial soils to a height of about above current sea level throughout the Tualatin, Yamhill and Willamette Valleys.
Until the mid-19th century, the Silverton area was a broad, open grassland with small stands of Oregon white oak, ponderosa pine and Douglas fir. Stands of Oregon white oak, red alder, big leaf maple, and black cottonwood lined streams and river banks. While these tree species are extant today, widespread farming in the Willamette Valley between 1850 and 1870 altered the land through the discontinuation of widespread seasonal burning in the valley plains previously employed by the Kalapuya people. Large stands of Douglas fir and western red cedar, mixed with Oregon white oak, remain in the Silverton area, especially on eastern ridge tops and on the slopes of the Waldo Hills to the south. Due to decades of intensive timber extraction, mature second- and third-growth trees comprise existing evergreen stands.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The first white settlers arrived at Silver Creek in the 1800s. Two settlers, James Smith and John Barger created a sawmill along the creek in 1846. The town was originally known as Milford. In 1854, the town was abandoned and the settlers moved downstream to the current spot of Silverton. The town was first known as Silver Creek but the name was changed a year later. The town expanded and grew and was incorporated in 1885. The town now housed about 229 people. The town continued to grow until now, where it now has over 10,000 people.

===Killing of Andrew Hanlon===
In June 2008, Silverton came to international attention when an unarmed Irish citizen, Andrew James (AJ) Hanlon, aged 20, was killed by a police officer, Tony Gonzalez, in controversial circumstances. Gonzalez, who was responding to a reported disturbance of the peace, shot the unarmed Hanlon five times, although Hanlon&#x27;s sister recalled seeing seven bullets in her brother&#x27;s body.
The death, which Hanlon&#x27;s sister described as the only shooting in Silverton in the past twenty years, was greeted with shock there as well as in Ireland, particularly when it emerged that Hanlon had been experiencing psychological issues and had most probably gotten lost on his way home to his sister&#x27;s house in Silverton. Complaints were made by Hanlon&#x27;s family that it took six hours for the police to inform his sister of her brother&#x27;s death, despite her living only a mile away, and questions were asked why the police had not used a tazer, which was available to them. Requests for transparency were greeted by obfuscation and secrecy and claims that, in Andrew Hanlon&#x27;s mother&#x27;s words, the city&#x27;s establishment &quot;had closed ranks on&quot; the Hanlon family to protect Gonzalez. while the Consulate in San Francisco of the Government of Ireland registered concern over the killing. Protests outside Silverton City Hall were also ignored. On 24 July 2008, a Marion County grand jury found that because Gonzalez had testified that he believed that Andrew James Hanlon was armed, his killing was justified. Eight days later, on August 1, 2008, and just over a month after Andrew was killed on the 30th of June, Gonzalez resigned from Silverton&#x27;s police department. He had been arrested in July and charged with child abuse. On December 7, 2008, Gonzalez was sentenced to 6 years and 3 months imprisonment when he pleaded guilty to sexually abusing a teenage girl.

<text>St. Paul or Saint Paul is a city in Marion County, Oregon, United States. It is named after the Saint Paul Mission founded by Archbishop François Norbert Blanchet, who arrived in the Oregon Country in 1838 to minister to the Catholic inhabitants of French Prairie. The population was 434 at the 2020 census. The city is part of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==

French Prairie settlers built a log church near this locale in 1836. On January 6, 1839, Father (later Archbishop) Blanchet celebrated the first Catholic mass in Oregon at St. Paul, when he blessed the log church and dedicated it to St. Paul.

St. Paul Roman Catholic Church was built in 1846 and is the oldest brick building in the Pacific Northwest.

St. Paul post office was established in 1874. The city was incorporated in 1901.

===Pioneer cemetery===
St. Paul Pioneer Cemetery, founded in 1839, is the burial location for William Cannon, the only authenticated Revolutionary War veteran buried in Oregon. He had arrived in Oregon in 1811 as part of John Jacob Astor&#x27;s American Fur Company. His is the only grave marked with an upright headstone in the cemetery. Only one other grave is marked; the rest of the grave markers were mistakenly bulldozed in the 1930s.

Along with Cannon, 535 other early settlers and Native Americans are buried in the pioneer cemetery, including Étienne Lucier, known as &quot;The Father of Oregon Agriculture&quot;, and François Rivet and Philippe Degre who claimed to be members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Rivet had accompanied the expedition as far as Fort Mandan, and Degre attached himself in to the company while they wintered there in 1804–1805.

A wall of remembrance in the cemetery was dedicated in 2005, with members of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon as honored guests. Early French Canadian settlers often married women from the local tribes, which included the Clackamas, Molala and Kalapuya.

Archbishop Blanchet was originally buried in the pioneer cemetery, but his remains were later moved to St. Paul Catholic Cemetery a few blocks away. The new cemetery was founded in 1875 and includes a &quot;Nuns Corner&quot;, where several sisters who had originally been buried in a corner of the convent garden were reinterred. Early settler and provisional legislator William J. Bailey is also buried at the new cemetery.

<doc id="130909" wikidata="Q2018774" url="?curid=130909" title="Stayton, Oregon">
<text>Stayton is a city in Marion County, Oregon, United States, located southeast of the state capital, Salem, on Oregon Route 22. It is south of Sublimity and east of Aumsville. Located on the North Santiam River, Stayton is a regional agricultural and light manufacturing center. The population was 8,244 at the 2020 census. Established in 1872, it was incorporated in 1891.

== History==
Stayton was founded by Drury Smith Stayton, who purchased the town site in 1866 and built a carding mill and sawmill on a watercourse of the North Santiam River. In 1872, he platted the town site, and that same year the community received a post office. A ferry crossing of the Santiam River operated from 1876 until a bridge was constructed in 1888. By 1880, a laundry had been established by Kee Sing and Tom. The first newspaper, &quot;The Stayton Sun&quot;, was published in 1889 by T. H. McGill.

The founder of Stayton, Drury Stayton, originally wanted to name the city after his daughter, Florence Stayton. After his petition was denied by the post office because another city in Oregon was named Florence, he chose Stayton and named a street after his daughter. The city was incorporated as the Town of Stayton in 1891 after a failed attempt in 1884.

<text>Woodburn is a city in Marion County, Oregon, United States. Incorporated in 1889, the community had been platted in 1871 after the arrival of the railroad. The city is located in the northern end of the Willamette Valley between Portland and Salem. Interstate 5 connects it to major cities to the north and south. Oregon routes 211, 214, 219, and 99E also serve the city, as do Union Pacific and Willamette Valley Railway freight rail lines.

Woodburn is part of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area. With a population of 26,013 at the 2020 census, it is the third-most populous in that metropolitan area after Salem and Keizer.

==History==

Originally, the area around Woodburn was inhabited by the Kalapuya Native Americans. After the Provisional Government of Oregon set-up land claims in the Oregon Country, the United States annexed much of the Pacific Northwest and established the Oregon Territory in 1848. Congress passed the Donation Land Claim Act in 1850 and many earlier land claims became donation land claims.

Eli C. Cooley, Bradford S. Bonney, George Leisure, and Jean B. Ducharme all established donation land claims on the eastern part of the French Prairie where Woodburn would later be founded. Cooley immigrated to Oregon in 1845, and Bonney established his land claim in 1849. Ducharme&#x27;s land was sold off in 1862 in a foreclosure, with Mt. Angel farmer Jesse Settlemier purchasing the on the cheap.

Settlemier had traveled west over the Oregon Trail in 1849 and first settled in California before moving north to Oregon in 1850. He settled in the Mt. Angel area where he was a successful nurseryman. Settlemier then moved to his new property in 1863 and established the Woodburn Nursery Company. Despite improvements to the land, including construction of his home, title in the land remained in doubt due to the purchase via a foreclosure.

During the litigation over title in the land, Settlemier borrowed money from capitalist William Reed with the land as collateral. When Reed began to build a railroad through the area, he decided to run the line through what became Woodburn in anticipation of acquiring the land himself, as he expected Settlemier to default on the mortgage. However, Settlemier did not default and eventually his case made it to the Supreme Court of the United States in &quot;Settlemier v. Sullivan&quot;, 97 U.S. 444 (1878). He gained a favorable ruling and retained the land.

Meanwhile, transportation baron Ben Holladay ran his Oregon and California Railroad through what became Woodburn in 1871, at which time Settlemier platted the first four blocks of the town.

Originally, the town and station were called Halsey, but the name was changed to Woodburn due to the existence of Halsey, Oregon, further down the valley. The name Woodburn came about after a slash burn that got out of control and burned down a nearby woodlot in the 1880s, after the railroad line had been laid through the area. A railroad official witnessed the fire and renamed the community. The city was incorporated by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on February 20, 1889.

<text>Boardman is a city in Morrow County, Oregon, United States on the Columbia River and Interstate 84. As of the 2020 census the population was 3,828. It is currently the largest town in Morrow County, Oregon.

==History==
Boardman was homesteaded in 1903 by Samuel H. Boardman, the first superintendent of the Oregon State Parks System. Boardman and his wife worked for 13 years to develop irrigation for their land; during those years his wife taught school, and Boardman at times worked on railroad construction projects. The Union Pacific Railroad passed through Boardman, where it had a station. The community was platted in 1916 at about the same time Samuel Boardman went to work for the Oregon State Highway Department and became involved in the development of roadside parks.

The Boardman post office opened in 1916. The city was incorporated in 1921. South of Boardman, the U.S. Army Air Force established a training range in 1941. The Air Force transferred ownership of the range in 1960 to the U.S. Navy and it is now known as the Naval Weapons Systems Training Facility Boardman. The range is largely used by NAS Whidbey Island and the Oregon National Guard.

During construction of the John Day Dam on the Columbia River in the 1960s, the city had to be moved south, further from the waters of the planned Lake Umatilla. Boardman&#x27;s tourist-oriented businesses were relocated first to serve Interstate 80N (now I-84), which had recently opened, on land that was released by the federal government. The filling of Lake Umatilla began in April 1968 and was completed later that year, completely inundating the old town. The new townsite cost $1.5million to construct.

==Economy==

As of 2013, the six largest employers in Boardman are Lamb Weston (potato products) (370 employees); Oregon Potato Company (125); Portland General Electric (PGE) (113); the Morrow County School District (106), Boardman Foods, (100) and Amazon S3.

The Port of Morrow, Oregon&#x27;s second-largest port, is adjacent to the city and located on the Columbia Riverfront. The port property also includes two (PGE) gas-fired power plants. PGE also had a coal-fired power plant, the Boardman Coal Plant, which opened in 1980 and shut down in October 2020, marking the closure of the last coal-fired power plant in Oregon after 40 years of service. The Boardman Coal Plant was demolished in 2022. The plant had produced power at a rate of 550 megawatts and was the largest single point of emission of greenhouse gases in Oregon. The Umatilla Chemical Depot, which includes the Umatilla Chemical Agent Disposal Facility, is east of the city, northwest of the intersection of I-84 and Interstate 82. The Irrigon Fish Hatchery is east of Boardman. Threemile Canyon Farms is the largest farm located in Boardman.


&quot;The Oregonian&quot; reported in November 2008 that Amazon was building a large data center at the Port of Morrow. The data center was to have a dedicated 10-megawatt electrical substation. A website focused on data centers suggested the Boardman site was created in response to the rapid growth of Amazon Web Services; earlier in 2008, Amazon had announced that Amazon S3 was storing 29 billion objects (such as IMDb tables). The Amazon data center at the Port of Morrow began operating in 2011 as one of three Amazon data centers in the region at the time. The project made Boardman the second Oregon city along the Columbia River to host a power-hungry data center for web services; Google already had a similar center in The Dalles. By 2012, Apple had announced plans for a server farm south of The Dalles in Prineville, where Facebook already had a similar farm. Rackspace was said to be considering a data center at the Port of Morrow. According to an August 2018 article in the &quot;East Oregonian&quot;, Amazon has two data centers in Boardman and one in Umatilla and is proposing to build four more data centers in the region. The three data centers in Boardman and Umatilla correspond to the three availability zones in AWS US-West-2 (Oregon) region.

Since 2007, Alto Ingredients, formerly known as Pacific Ethanol, has operated an ethanol plant in Boardman. It can produce up to of ethanol a year from grains. ZeaChem has built a demonstration biorefinery at the Port of Morrow with a capacity of up to of ethanol a year from wood waste. The company hopes to build a much larger commercial refinery with a capacity of annually. However, in April 2013, less than a month after start-up at the demonstration plant, ZeaChem halted production, citing funding problems. The company plans to resume production if financial backing can be found.

===Coal export===
Ambre Energy, a company based in Australia, proposed in 2011 to use the Port of Morrow as a transfer point for shipping U.S. coal to Asia. Ambre wants to export up to of coal per year from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana. It would ship the coal by train to Boardman, where it would be loaded on barges and hauled down the Columbia River to the Port of St. Helens. There it would be transferred to ocean-going ships headed for China, South Korea, Japan, and other Asian countries.

The Ambre plan generated controversy among proponents touting economic benefits and opponents fearing environmental damage. In 2014, the Oregon Department of State Lands denied the company a necessary permit for the project, and the company abandoned the coal shipping proposal in 2016.

==Transportation==
Boardman Airport, owned by the Port of Morrow, is southwest of the city. It is a public airport used mainly for transient and local general aviation. Midcolumbia Bus Company are also in the Boardman area.

<doc id="130914" wikidata="Q571376" url="?curid=130914" title="Heppner, Oregon">
<text>Heppner is a city in, and the county seat of, Morrow County, Oregon, United States. As of 2010, the population was 1,291. Heppner is part of the Pendleton-Hermiston Micropolitan Area. Heppner is named after Henry Heppner, a prominent Jewish-American businessman.

==History==

=== Native American settlement ===
Native Americans lived and traveled along the land between the Columbia Gorge and the Blue Mountains for more than 10,000 years prior to European-American settlement. Ancient petroglyphs have been found approximately 45 miles (72 km.) north of Heppner in Irrigon and Boardman. In 1855, the U.S. Government and the predominant tribes in the region—the Cayuse, Umatilla, and Walla Walla—signed a treaty whereby the tribes gave up, or ceded, to the United States more than 6.4 million acres in what is now northeastern Oregon and southeastern Washington.

===European-American settlement===
Prior to Heppner&#x27;s founding in 1872, European-American ranchers used the area as sheep and cattle range as early as 1858. Records suggest these early cattlemen found abundant rye grass along creek bottoms.

Heppner was originally called Standsbury Flats for George W. Standsbury, one of the first European-American settlers in the area. In 1872, Colonel (Col.) Jackson Lee Morrow, a merchant, entered into a partnership with Henry Heppner, a prominent Jewish businessman, and they built a store on the crossing of the present May and Main streets. Soon thereafter, a mail and stagecoach line began operations between Pendleton and The Dalles and passed through Heppner.

Col. Jackson Lee Morrow was later elected to the Oregon legislative assembly and was instrumental in helping to carve out a new county for Heppner from neighboring Umatilla County and a portion of Wasco County. The assembly named the new county in Morrow&#x27;s honor.

Heppner was designated the temporary county seat at the time the county was created and narrowly defeated nearby Lexington in an election held in 1886 to determine the permanent county seat. Heppner was incorporated in the following year on February 9, 1887.

In 1888, the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company completed a railroad spur from the Columbia River up the Willow Creek drainage to Heppner.

The Historic Morrow County Courthouse was built in 1902-03 and is one of the oldest continuously used courthouses in Oregon. In 1985, the courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
=== Flood of June 1903 ===

Heppner was almost destroyed by a flash flood on Sunday, June 14, 1903. The flood was precipitated by a sudden cloudburst and accompanying hail that caused a debris dam collapse and flash flooding, notably on Willow Creek. A wall of water and debris swept down the creeks and canyons and through the city. It has been estimated that 238 people (a quarter of the city&#x27;s population) drowned, making it the deadliest natural disaster in Oregon&#x27;s history. Property damage was reported at nearly $1 million. The nearby cities of Ione and Lexington also sustained significant damage. In 1983, the Willow Creek Dam at the outskirts of the city was finished.

===Post-flood recovery===
The railroad and a growing network of roads had by the early decades of the 20th century made Heppner a trade center and distribution point for regional farm products including wheat, alfalfa, sheep, cattle, horses, and hogs. Despite the flood and two fires in 1918 that destroyed City Hall, the Palace Hotel, the library, many businesses, and more than 30 homes, the community rebuilt. One of its creations, the Heppner Hotel, opened in 1920 and, housing a variety of businesses over the years, it served as a community gathering place through 1972, when its last restaurant closed.
===Later history===
In 1940, a major sawmill was built in the town by the Heppner Lumber Company, helping drive the area&#x27;s economy. The mill was destroyed by fire in 1949, but was rebuilt and sold to Kinzua Lumber Company, which ultimately relocated its headquarters to Heppner. In 1999, the mill closed, dealing a significant blow to Heppner&#x27;s economy and resulting in the loss of nearly 200 jobs.

<text>Lexington is a town in Morrow County, Oregon, United States. The population was 238 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Pendleton–Hermiston Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Lexington was named by early settler William Penland for his hometown of Lexington, Kentucky. Lexington post office was established in 1885. 
In 1886, shortly after Morrow County was created, Lexington lost by 33 votes to Heppner in an election to determine the county seat. The town was incorporated in 1903, and had a population of 185 at the 1910 census.

Sheep ranching was important in the region during the days of early settlement by non-natives. It continues in the 21st century and has been joined by wheat farming and cattle ranching as significant uses of the land.

==Geography==
Lexington is located between the Columbia River to the north and the Blue Mountains to the southeast. The town is along Oregon Route 74, about northwest of Heppner. Lexington is about southwest of Hermiston and east of Portland.

Willow Creek flows through Lexington, which is downstream of Heppner and upstream of Ione and Arlington. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

Route 74 forms part of the Blue Mountain Scenic Byway, a set of roads connecting Interstate 84 (I-84) along the Columbia River with the North Fork John Day River in the Blue Mountains. Part of the route follows the Willow Creek drainage through Lexington.

==Economy and education==
As of 2002, Lexington&#x27;s largest employers were the Morrow County Grain Growers (farms), the Columbia Basin Electric Co-op in Heppner, a metal fabrication company in Heppner, and a small company in Lexington that repaired farm equipment.

The headquarters of the Morrow County School District is in Lexington. The nearest public schools in this district are in Heppner.

<text>Leadership, is defined as the ability of an individual, group, or organization to &quot;&quot;, influence, or guide other individuals, teams, or organizations.

&quot;Leadership&quot; is a contested term. Specialist literature debates various viewpoints on the concept, sometimes contrasting Eastern and Western approaches to leadership, and also (within the West) North American versus European approaches.

Some U.S. academic environments define leadership as &quot;a process of social influence in which a person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common and ethical task&quot;. In other words, leadership is an influential power-relationship in which the power of one party (the &quot;leader&quot;) promotes movement/change in others (the &quot;followers&quot;). Some have challenged the more traditional managerial views of leadership (which portray leadership as something possessed or owned by one individual due to their role or authority), and instead advocate the complex nature of leadership which is found at all levels of institutions, both within formal and informal roles.

Studies of leadership have produced theories involving (for example) traits, situational interaction,
function, behavior, power, vision, values, charisma, and intelligence,
among others.

==Historical views==
The Chinese doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven postulated the need for rulers to govern justly, and the right of subordinates to overthrow emperors who appeared to lack divine sanction.

Pro-aristocracy thinkers
have postulated that leadership depends on one&#x27;s &quot;blue blood&quot; or genes.
Monarchy takes an extreme view of the same idea, and may prop up its assertions against the claims of mere aristocrats by invoking divine sanction (see the divine right of kings). On the other hand, more democratically inclined theorists have pointed to examples of meritocratic leaders, such as the Napoleonic marshals profiting from careers open to talent.

In the autocratic/paternalistic strain of thought, traditionalists recall the role of leadership of the Roman . Feminist thinking, on the other hand, may object to such models as patriarchal and posit against them &quot;emotionally attuned, responsive, and consensual empathetic guidance, which is sometimes associated with matriarchies&quot;.

Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;The Prince&quot;, written in the early-16th century, provided a manual for rulers (&quot;princes&quot; or &quot;tyrants&quot; in Machiavelli&#x27;s terminology) to gain and keep political power.

Prior to the 19th century, the concept of leadership had less relevance than today—society expected and obtained traditional deference and obedience to lords, kings, master-craftsmen, and slave-masters. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; traces the word &quot;leadership&quot; in English only as far back as 1821, when the term referred to the position or office of a designated leader.
The abstract notion of &quot;leadership&quot; as embodying the qualities and behaviors associated with leaders and influencers developed only later during the 19th and 20th centuries - possibly traceable from 1870 onwards.
Historically, industrialization, opposition to the , and the phasing out of chattel slavery meant that some newly developing organizations (nation-state republics, commercial corporations) evolved a need for a new paradigm with which to characterize elected politicians and job-granting employers—thus the development and theorizing of the idea of &quot;leadership&quot;.
The functional relationship between leaders and followers may remain,
but acceptable (perhaps euphemistic) terminology has changed.

Starting in the 19th century, the elaboration of anarchist thought called the whole concept of leadership into question. One response to this denial of élitism came with Leninism—Lenin (1870–1924) demanded an élite group of disciplined cadres to act as the vanguard of a socialist revolution, which was to bring into existence the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Other historical views of leadership have addressed the seeming contrasts between secular and religious leadership. The doctrines of Caesaro-papism have recurred and had their detractors over several centuries. Christian thinking on leadership has often emphasized stewardship of divinely-provided resources—human and material—and their deployment in accordance with a Divine plan. Compare this with servant leadership.

For a more general view on leadership in politics, compare the concept of the .

==Theories==
Anecdotal and incidental observations aside, the serious discipline of theorising leadership began in the 19th century.

===Early Western history===

The search for the characteristics or traits of leaders has continued for centuries. Philosophical writings from Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; to Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot; have explored the question &quot;What qualities distinguish an individual as a leader?&quot; Underlying this search was the early recognition of the importance of leadership and the assumption that leadership is rooted in the characteristics that certain individuals possess. This idea that leadership is based on individual attributes is known as the &quot;trait theory of leadership&quot;.

A number of works in the 19th century – when the traditional authority of monarchs, lords, and bishops had begun to wane – explored the trait theory at length: especially the writings of Thomas Carlyle and of Francis Galton. In &quot;Heroes and Hero Worship&quot; (1841), Carlyle identified the talents, skills, and physical characteristics of men who rose to power. Galton&#x27;s &quot;Hereditary Genius&quot; (1869) examined leadership qualities in the families of powerful men. After showing that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when his focus moved from first-degree to second-degree relatives, Galton concluded that leadership was inherited.

Cecil Rhodes (1853–1902) believed that public-spirited leadership could be nurtured by identifying young people with &quot;moral force of character and instincts to lead&quot;, and educating them in contexts (such as the collegiate environment of the University of Oxford) that further developed such characteristics. International networks of such leaders could help to promote international understanding and help &quot;render war impossible&quot;. This vision of leadership underlay the creation of the Rhodes Scholarships, which have helped to shape notions of leadership since their creation in 1903.

===Rise of alternative theories===

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, a series of qualitative reviews prompted researchers to take a drastically different view of the driving forces behind leadership. In reviewing the extant literature, Stogdill and Mann found that while some traits were common across a number of studies, the overall evidence suggested that people who are leaders in one situation may not necessarily be leaders in other situations. Subsequently, leadership was no longer characterized as an enduring individual trait—situational approaches (see alternative leadership theories below) posited that individuals can be effective in certain situations, but not others. The focus then shifted away from traits of leaders to an investigation of the leader behaviors that were effective. This approach dominated much of the leadership theory and research for the next few decades.

===Reemergence of trait theory===

New methods and measurements were developed after these influential reviews that would ultimately reestablish trait theory as a viable approach to the study of leadership. For example, improvements in researchers&#x27; use of the round-robin research design methodology allowed researchers to see that individuals can and do emerge as leaders across a variety of situations and tasks. Additionally, during the 1980s statistical advances allowed researchers to conduct meta-analyses, in which they could quantitatively analyze and summarize the findings from a wide array of studies. This advent allowed trait theorists to create a comprehensive picture of previous leadership research rather than rely on the qualitative reviews of the past. Equipped with new methods, leadership researchers revealed the following:
* Individuals can and do emerge as leaders across a variety of situations and tasks.
* Significant relationships exist between leadership emergence and such individual traits as:
:*Intelligence
:*Adjustment
:*Extraversion
:*Conscientiousness
:*Openness to experience
:*General self-efficacy

While the trait theory of leadership has certainly regained popularity, its reemergence has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in sophisticated conceptual frameworks.

Specifically, Stephen Zaccaro noted that trait theories still:
* focus on a small set of individual attributes such as the &quot;Big Five&quot; personality traits, to the neglect of cognitive abilities, motives, values, social skills, expertise, and problem-solving skills
* fail to consider patterns or integrations of multiple attributes
* do not distinguish between the leadership attributes that are generally not malleable over time and those that are shaped by, and bound to, situational influences
* do not consider how stable leader attributes account for the behavioral diversity necessary for effective leadership

===Attribute pattern approach===

Considering the criticisms of the trait theory outlined above, several researchers adopted a different perspective of leader individual differences—the leader-attribute-pattern approach. In contrast to the traditional approach, the leader-attribute-pattern approach is based on theorists&#x27; arguments that the influence of individual characteristics on outcomes is best understood by considering the person as an integrated totality rather than a summation of individual variables. In other words, the leader-attribute-pattern approach argues that integrated constellations or combinations of individual differences may explain substantial variance in both leader emergence and leader effectiveness beyond that explained by single attributes, or by additive combinations of multiple attributes.

===Behavioral and style theories===
In response to the early criticisms of the trait approach, theorists began to research leadership as a set of behaviors by evaluating the behavior of successful leaders, determining a behavior taxonomy, and identifying broad leadership styles. David McClelland, for example, posited that leadership requires a strong personality with a well-developed positive ego. To lead, self-confidence and high self-esteem are useful, perhaps even essential.
Kurt Lewin, Ronald Lipitt, and Ralph White developed in 1939 the seminal work on the influence of leadership styles and performance. The researchers evaluated the performance of groups of eleven-year-old boys under different types of work climate. In each, the leader exercised his influence regarding the type of group decision making, praise and criticism (feedback), and the management of the group tasks (project management) according to three styles: authoritarian, democratic, and laissez-faire.

In 1945, Ohio State University conducted a study which investigated observable behaviors portrayed by effective leaders. They identified particular behaviors that were reflective of leadership effectiveness. They narrowed their findings to two dimensions. The first dimension, &quot;initiating structure&quot;, described how a leader clearly and accurately communicates with the followers, defines goals, and determines how tasks are performed. These are considered &quot;task oriented&quot; behaviors. The second dimension, &quot;consideration&quot;, indicates the leader&#x27;s ability to build an interpersonal relationship with their followers, and to establish a form of mutual trust. These are considered &quot;social oriented&quot; behaviors.

The Michigan State Studies, which were conducted in the 1950s, made further investigations and findings that positively correlated behaviors and leadership effectiveness. Although they had similar findings as the Ohio State studies, they also contributed an additional behavior identified in leaders: participative behavior (also called &quot;servant leadership&quot;), or allowing the followers to participate in group decision making and encouraged subordinate input. This entails avoiding controlling types of leadership and allows more personal interactions between leaders and their subordinates.

The managerial grid model is also based on a behavioral theory. The model was developed by Robert Blake and Jane Mouton in 1964. It suggests five different leadership styles, based on the leaders&#x27; concern for people and their concern for goal achievement.

====Positive reinforcement====
B. F. Skinner is the father of behavior modification and developed the concept of positive reinforcement. Positive reinforcement occurs when a positive stimulus is presented in response to a behavior, which increases the likelihood of that behavior in the future. The following is an example of how positive reinforcement can be used in a business setting. Assume praise is a positive reinforcer for a particular employee. This employee does not show up to work on time every day. The manager decides to praise the employee for showing up on time every day the employee actually shows up to work on time. As a result, the employee comes to work on time more often because the employee likes to be praised. In this example, praise (the stimulus) is a positive reinforcer for this employee because the employee arrives at work on time (the behavior) more frequently after being praised for showing up to work on time.

Positive reinforcement is a successful technique used by leaders to motivate and attain desired behaviors from subordinates. Organizations such as Frito-Lay, 3M, Goodrich, Michigan Bell, and Emery Air Freight have all used reinforcement to increase productivity. Empirical research covering the last 20 years suggests that applying reinforcement theory leads to a 17 percent increase in performance. Additionally, many reinforcement techniques such as the use of praise are inexpensive, providing higher performance for lower costs.

===Situational and contingency theories===
Situational theory is another reaction to the trait theory of leadership. Social scientists argued that history was more than the result of intervention of great men as Carlyle suggested. Herbert Spencer (1884) (and Karl Marx) said that the times produce the person and not the other way around. This theory assumes that different situations call for different characteristics: no single optimal psychographic profile of a leader exists. According to the theory, &quot;what an individual actually does when acting as a leader is in large part dependent upon characteristics of the situation in which he functions.&quot;

Some theorists synthesized the trait and situational approaches. Building upon the research of Lewin et al., academics normalized the descriptive models of leadership climates, defining three leadership styles and identifying which situations each style works better in. The authoritarian leadership style, for example, is approved in periods of crisis but fails to win the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; of followers in day-to-day management; the democratic leadership style is more adequate in situations that require consensus building; finally, the laissez-faire leadership style is appreciated for the degree of freedom it provides, but as the leaders do not &quot;take charge&quot;, they can be perceived as a failure in protracted or thorny organizational problems. Theorists defined the style of leadership as contingent to the situation; this is sometimes called contingency theory. Three contingency leadership theories are the Fiedler contingency model, the Vroom-Yetton decision model, and the path-goal theory.

The Fiedler contingency model bases the leader&#x27;s effectiveness on what Fred Fiedler called &quot;situational contingency&quot;. This results from the interaction of leadership style and situational favorability (later called &quot;situational control&quot;). The theory defines two types of leader: those who tend to accomplish the task by developing good relationships with the group (relationship-oriented), and those who have as their prime concern carrying out the task itself (task-oriented). According to Fiedler, there is no ideal leader. Both task-oriented and relationship-oriented leaders can be effective if their leadership orientation fits the situation. When there is a good leader-member relation, a highly structured task, and high leader position power, the situation is considered a &quot;favorable situation&quot;. Fiedler found that task-oriented leaders are more effective in extremely favorable or unfavorable situations, whereas relationship-oriented leaders perform best in situations with intermediate favorability.

Victor Vroom, in collaboration with Phillip Yetton and later with Arthur Jago, developed a taxonomy for describing leadership situations. They used this in a normative decision model in which leadership styles were connected to situational variables, defining which approach was more suitable to which situation. This approach supported the idea that a manager could rely on different group decision making approaches depending on the attributes of each situation. This model was later referred to as situational contingency theory.

The path-goal theory of leadership was developed by Robert House and was based on the expectancy theory of Victor Vroom. According to House, &quot;leaders, to be effective, engage in behaviors that complement subordinates&#x27; environments and abilities in a manner that compensates for deficiencies and is instrumental to subordinate satisfaction and individual and work unit performance&quot;. The theory identifies four leader behaviors, &quot;achievement-oriented&quot;, &quot;directive&quot;, &quot;participative&quot;, and &quot;supportive&quot;, that are contingent to environment factors and follower characteristics. In contrast to the Fiedler contingency model, the path-goal model states that the four leadership behaviors are fluid, and that leaders can adopt any of the four depending on what the situation demands. The path-goal model can be classified both as a contingency theory, as it depends on the circumstances, and as a transactional leadership theory, as the theory emphasizes the reciprocity behavior between the leader and the followers.

===Functional theory===
Functional leadership theory addresses specific leader behaviors that contribute to organizational or unit effectiveness. This theory argues that the leader&#x27;s main job is to see that whatever is necessary to group needs is taken care of; thus, a leader can be said to have done their job well when they have contributed to group effectiveness and cohesion. While functional leadership theory has most often been applied to team leadership, it has also been effectively applied to broader organizational leadership as well. In summarizing literature on functional leadership, researchers observed five broad functions a leader performs when promoting organization&#x27;s effectiveness. These functions include environmental monitoring, organizing subordinate activities, teaching and coaching subordinates, motivating others, and intervening actively in the group&#x27;s work.

Various leadership behaviors facilitate these functions. In initial work identifying leader behavior, Fleishman observed that subordinates perceived their supervisors&#x27; behavior in terms of two broad categories referred to as consideration and initiating structure. Consideration includes behavior involved in fostering effective relationships. Examples of such behavior would include showing concern for a subordinate or acting in a supportive manner towards others. Initiating structure involves the actions of the leader focused specifically on task accomplishment. This could include role clarification, setting performance standards, and holding subordinates accountable to those standards.

===Integrated psychological theory===
The Integrated Psychological Theory of leadership attempts to integrate the strengths of the older theories (i.e. traits, behavioral/styles, situational and functional) while addressing their limitations, introducing a new element – the need for leaders to develop their leadership presence, attitude toward others, and behavioral flexibility by practicing psychological mastery. It also offers a foundation for leaders wanting to apply the philosophies of servant leadership and authentic leadership.

Integrated psychological theory began to attract attention after the publication of James Scouller&#x27;s Three Levels of Leadership model (2011).
Scouller argued that older theories offered only limited assistance in developing a person&#x27;s ability to lead effectively. He pointed out, for example, that:
* Traits theories, which tend to reinforce the idea that leaders are born not made, might help us select leaders, but they are less useful for developing leaders.
* An ideal style (e.g. Blake &amp; Mouton&#x27;s team style) would not suit all circumstances.
* Most of the situational/contingency and functional theories assume that leaders can change their behavior to meet differing circumstances or widen their behavioral range at will, when in practice many find it hard to do so because of unconscious beliefs, fears, or ingrained habits. Thus, he argued, leaders need to work on their inner psychology.
* None of the older theories successfully addressed the challenge of developing &quot;leadership presence&quot;—that certain &quot;something&quot; in leaders that commands attention, inspires people, wins their trust, and makes followers want to work with them.

Scouller&#x27;s model aims to summarize what leaders have to do, not only to bring leadership to their group or organization, but also to develop themselves technically and psychologically as leaders. The three levels in his model are public, private, and personal leadership:
* The first two—public and private leadership—are &quot;outer&quot; or behavioral levels. These behaviors address what Scouller called &quot;the four dimensions of leadership&quot;. These dimensions are: (1) a shared, motivating group purpose; (2) action, progress and results; (3) collective unity or team spirit; and (4) individual selection and motivation. Public leadership focuses on the 34 behaviors involved in influencing two or more people simultaneously. Private leadership covers the 14 behaviors needed to influence individuals one-to-one.
* The third—personal leadership—is an &quot;inner&quot; level and concerns a person&#x27;s growth toward greater leadership presence, know-how, and skill. Working on one&#x27;s personal leadership has three aspects: (1) Technical know-how and skill, (2) Developing the right attitude toward other people, which is the basis of servant leadership, and (3) Psychological self-mastery, the foundation for authentic leadership.

Scouller argued that self-mastery is the key to growing one&#x27;s leadership presence, building trusting relationships with followers, and dissolving one&#x27;s limiting beliefs and habits. This enables behavioral flexibility as circumstances change, while staying connected to one&#x27;s core values (that is, while remaining authentic). To support leaders&#x27; development, he introduced a new model of the human psyche and outlined the principles and techniques of self-mastery, which include the practice of mindfulness meditation.

===Transactional and transformational theories===
Bernard Bass and colleagues developed the idea of two different types of leadership: &quot;transactional&quot; which involves exchange of labor for rewards, and &quot;transformational&quot; which is based on concern for employees, intellectual stimulation, and providing a group vision.

The transactional leader is given power to perform certain tasks and reward or punish for the team&#x27;s performance. It gives the opportunity to the manager to lead the group and the group agrees to follow his lead to accomplish a predetermined goal in exchange for something else. Power is given to the leader to evaluate, correct, and train subordinates when productivity is not up to the desired level, and reward effectiveness when expected outcome is reached.

===Leader–member exchange theory===

Leader–member exchange (LMX) theory addresses a specific aspect of the leadership process, which evolved from an earlier theory called the vertical dyad linkage model. Both of these models focus on the interaction between leaders and individual followers. Similar to the transactional approach, this interaction is viewed as a fair exchange whereby the leader provides certain benefits such as task guidance, advice, support, and/or significant rewards and the followers reciprocate by giving the leader respect, cooperation, commitment to the task and good performance. However, LMX recognizes that leaders and individual followers will vary in the type of exchange that develops between them. LMX theorizes that the type of exchanges between the leader and specific followers can lead to the creation of &quot;in-groups&quot; and &quot;out-groups&quot;. In-group members are said to have &quot;high-quality exchanges&quot; with the leader, while out-group members have &quot;low-quality exchanges&quot; with the leader.

====In-group members====

In-group members are perceived by the leader as being more experienced, competent, and willing to assume responsibility than other followers. The leader begins to rely on these individuals to help with especially challenging tasks. If the follower responds well, the leader rewards them with extra coaching, favorable job assignments, and developmental experiences. If the follower shows high commitment and effort followed by additional rewards, both parties develop mutual trust, influence, and support of one another. Research shows the in-group members usually receive higher performance evaluations from the leader, higher satisfaction, and faster promotions than out-group members. In-group members are also likely to build stronger bonds with their leaders by sharing the same social backgrounds and interests.

====Out-group members====

Out-group members often receive less time and more distant exchanges than their in-group counterparts. With out-group members, leaders expect no more than adequate job performance, good attendance, reasonable respect, and adherence to the job description in exchange for a fair wage and standard benefits. The leader spends less time with out-group members, they have fewer developmental experiences, and the leader tends to emphasize his/her formal authority to obtain compliance to leader requests. Research shows that out-group members are less satisfied with their job and organization, receive lower performance evaluations from the leader, see their leader as less fair, and are more likely to file grievances or leave the organization.

===Emotions===

Leadership can be an emotion-laden process, with emotions entwined with the social influence process. A leader&#x27;s mood affects his/her group. These effects can be described in three levels:
; The mood of individual group members : Members of groups whose leaders are in a positive mood experience more positive mood than do group members with leaders in a negative mood. Leaders transmit their moods to other group members through the mechanism of emotional contagion. Mood contagion may be one of the psychological mechanisms by which charismatic leaders influence followers.
; The affective tone of the group : Group affective tone represents the consistent or homogeneous affective reactions within a group. Group affective tone is an aggregate of the moods of the individual members of the group and refers to mood at the group level of analysis. Groups with leaders in a positive mood have a more positive affective tone than do groups with leaders in a negative mood.
; Group processes like coordination, effort expenditure, and task strategy : Public expressions of mood impact how group members think and act. When people experience and express mood, they send signals to others. Leaders signal their goals, intentions, and attitudes through their expressions of moods. For example, expressions of positive moods by leaders signal that leaders deem progress toward goals to be good. The group members respond to those signals cognitively and behaviorally in ways that are reflected in the group processes.
In research about client service, it was found that expressions of positive mood by the leader improve the performance of the group, although in other sectors there were other findings.

Beyond the leader&#x27;s mood, her/his behavior is a source for employee positive and negative emotions at work. The leader&#x27;s behavior creates situations and events that lead to emotional response, for example by giving feedback, allocating tasks, and distributing resources. Since employee behavior and productivity are affected by their emotional states, it is imperative to consider employee emotional responses to organizational leaders. Emotional intelligence—the ability to understand and manage moods and emotions in the self and others—contributes to effective leadership within organizations.

===Neo-emergent theory===
The neo-emergent leadership theory (from the Oxford Strategic Leadership Programme)
sees leadership as an impression formed through the communication of information by the leader or by other stakeholders, not through the actions of the leader. In other words, the reproduction of information or stories form the basis of the perception of leadership by the majority. It is well known by historians that the naval hero Lord Nelson often wrote his own versions of battles he was involved in, so that when he arrived home in England, he would receive a true hero&#x27;s welcome. In modern society, various media outlets, including the press and blogs, present their own interpretations of leaders. These depictions can stem from actual circumstances, but they might also arise from political influences, monetary incentives, or the personal agendas of the author, media, or leader. Consequently, the impression of leaders is often constructed and may not accurately mirror their genuine leadership attributes. This highlights the historical role of concepts like royal lineage, which once stood as a substitute for evaluating or comprehending adept governance abilities.

=== Constructivist analysis ===
Some constructivists question whether leadership exists, or suggest that (for example) leadership &quot;is a myth equivalent to a belief in UFOs&quot;.

=== Ontological-phenomenological model ===
Werner Erhard, Michael C. Jensen, Steve Zaffron, and Kari Granger described leadership as &quot;an exercise in language that results in the realization of a future that was not going to happen anyway, which future fulfills (or contributes to fulfilling) the concerns of the relevant parties.&quot; In this definition leadership concerns the future and includes the fundamental concerns of the relevant parties. This differs from relating to the relevant parties as &quot;followers&quot; and calling up an image of a single leader with others following. Rather, a future that fulfills the fundamental concerns of the relevant parties indicates the future that was not going to happen is not the &quot;idea of the leader&quot;, but rather is what emerges from digging deep to find the underlying concerns of those who are impacted by the leadership.

== Leadership emergence ==
Leadership emergence is the idea that people born with specific characteristics become leaders, and those without these characteristics do not become leaders.

Many personality characteristics are reliably associated with leadership emergence. The list includes, but is not limited to: assertiveness, authenticity, Big Five personality factors, birth order, character strengths, dominance, emotional intelligence, gender identity, intelligence, narcissism, self-efficacy for leadership, self-monitoring, and social motivation.
Other areas of study in relation to how and why leaders emerge include narcissistic traits, absentee leaders, and participation. Today&#x27;s sophisticated research methods look at personality characteristics in combination to determine patterns of leadership emergence.

Leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln, and Nelson Mandela share traits that an average person does not. Research indicates that up to 30% of leader emergence has a genetic basis. No research has found a &quot;leadership gene&quot;; instead we inherit certain traits that might influence our decision to seek leadership. Anecdotal and empirical evidence support a stable relationship between specific traits and leadership behavior. Using a large international sample researchers found three factors that motivate leaders: affective identity (enjoyment of leading), non-calculative (leading earns reinforcement), and social-normative (sense of obligation).

=== Assertiveness ===

The relationship between assertiveness and leadership emergence is curvilinear: individuals who are either low in assertiveness or very high in assertiveness are less likely to be identified as leaders.

=== Authenticity ===
Individuals who are more aware of their personality qualities, including their values and beliefs, and are less biased when processing self-relevant information, are more likely to be accepted as leaders.

=== Big Five personality factors ===

Those who emerge as leaders tend to be more extroverted, conscientious, emotionally stable, and open to experience, although these tendencies are stronger in laboratory studies of leaderless groups. However, introversion–extroversion appears to be the most influential quality in leadership emergence; specifically, leaders tend to be high in extroversion. Introversion–extroversion is also the quality that can be judged most easily among those in the Big Five Traits. Agreeableness, the last factor of the Big Five personality traits, does not seem to play any meaningful role in leadership emergence.

=== Birth order ===

Those born first in their families, and only children, are hypothesized to be more driven to seek leadership and control in social settings. Middle-born children tend to accept follower roles in groups, and later-borns are thought to be rebellious and creative.

=== Character strengths ===

Those seeking leadership positions in a military organization had elevated scores on a number of indicators of strength of character, including honesty, hope, bravery, industry, and teamwork.

=== Dominance ===

Individuals with dominant personalities (they describe themselves as high in the desire to control their environment and influence other people, and are likely to express their opinions in a forceful way) are more likely to act as leaders in small-group situations.

=== Emotional intelligence ===

Individuals with high emotional intelligence have increased ability to understand and relate to people. They have skills in communicating and decoding emotions and they deal with others wisely and effectively. Such people communicate their ideas in more robust ways, are better able to read the politics of a situation, are less likely to lose control of their emotions, are less likely to be inappropriately angry or critical, and in consequence are more likely to emerge as leaders.

=== Intelligence ===

Individuals with higher intelligence exhibit superior judgement, higher verbal skills (both written and oral), quicker learning and acquisition of knowledge, and are more likely to emerge as leaders. Correlation between IQ and leadership emergence was found to be between .25 and .30. However, groups generally prefer leaders that do not exceed in intelligence the prowess of average member by a wide margin, as they fear that high intelligence may be translated to differences in communication, trust, interests, and values.

=== Self-efficacy for leadership ===

An individual&#x27;s belief in their ability to lead is associated with an increased willingness to accept a leadership role and find success in its pursuit.

There are no set conditions for this characteristic to become emergent. However, it must be sustained by an individual&#x27;s belief that they have the ability to learn and improve it with time. Individuals partly evaluate their own capabilities by observing others; working with a superior who is seen as an effective leader may help the individual develop a belief that he or she can perform in a similar manner.

=== Self-monitoring ===

Individuals who closely manage and adjust their behavior based on the social context, often referred to as high self-monitors, have a greater tendency to assume leadership roles within a group. This propensity is attributed to their heightened interest in elevating their status and their readiness to conform their actions to match the requirements of the given situation.

=== Social motivation ===

People who exhibit both a drive for achievement and a desire for social connections tend to participate actively in group-based efforts to solve problems. Additionally, they have a higher likelihood of being chosen as leaders within these groups.

=== Narcissism, hubris and other negative traits ===

A number of negative traits of leadership have also been studied. Individuals who take on leadership roles in turbulent situations, such as groups facing a threat or ones in which status is determined by intense competition among rivals within the group, tend to be narcissistic: arrogant, self-absorbed, hostile, and very self-confident.

=== Absentee leader ===
Existing research has shown that absentee leaders—those who rise into power, but not necessarily because of their skills, and who are marginally engaging with their role—are actually worse than destructive leaders, because it takes longer to pinpoint their mistakes.

=== Willingness to participate ===
A willingness to participate in a group can indicate a person&#x27;s interest as well as their willingness to take responsibility for how the group performs. Those who do not say much during a group meeting are less likely to emerge as a leader than those who speak up. There is however some debate over whether the quality of participation in a group matters more than the quantity.

A hypothesis termed the &#x27;babble effect&#x27; or the &#x27;babble hypothesis&#x27; has been studied as a factor in the emergence of leaders. It posits that leader emergence is highly correlated with the quantity of speaking time—specifically, those who speak a lot in a group setting are more likely to become a group leader.

The quantity of participation is more important that the quality of these contributions when it comes to leader emergence. However, some studies indicate that there must be some element of quality combined with quantity to support leader emergence. Thus, while sheer quantity does matter to leadership, when the contributions made are also of high-quality leader emergence is further facilitated.

==Leadership styles==
A leadership style is a leader&#x27;s way of providing direction, implementing plans, and motivating people. It is the result of the philosophy, personality, and experience of the leader. Rhetoric specialists have also developed models for understanding leadership.

Different situations call for different leadership styles. In an emergency when there is little time to converge on an agreement and where a designated authority has significantly more experience or expertise than the rest of the team, an autocratic leadership style may be most effective; however, in a highly motivated and aligned team with a homogeneous level of expertise, a more democratic or laissez-faire style may be more effective. The best style is one that most effectively achieves the objectives of the group while balancing the interests of its individual members.

A field in which leadership style has gained attention is that of military science, which expresses a holistic and integrated view of leadership, including how a leader&#x27;s physical presence determines how others perceive that leader. The factors of physical presence are military bearing, physical fitness, confidence, and resilience. The leader&#x27;s intellectual capacity helps to conceptualize solutions and acquire knowledge to do the job. A leader&#x27;s conceptual abilities apply agility, judgment, innovation, interpersonal tact, and domain knowledge. Domain knowledge for leaders encompasses tactical and technical knowledge as well as cultural and geopolitical awareness.

===Autocratic or authoritarian===

Under the autocratic leadership style, all decision-making powers are centralized in the leader, as with dictators.

Autocratic leaders do not ask for or entertain any suggestions or initiatives from subordinates. Autocratic management can be successful as it provides strong motivation to the manager. It permits quick decision-making, as only one person decides for the whole group and keeps each decision to themselves until they feel it needs to be shared with the rest of the group.

===Participative or democratic===
The democratic or participative leadership style involves the leader actively sharing decision-making responsibilities with group members. This approach emphasizes collaboration and values the input of all team members, fostering a sense of ownership and inclusivity within the group. By promoting the interests and well-being of the team, democratic leaders encourage open communication and social equality. This style, also known as shared leadership, distributes authority and decision-making power among all members rather than centralizing it with the leader alone. This method enhances team morale and engagement and leverages diverse perspectives to drive more well-rounded and informed decisions.

=== Laissez-faire or free-rein leadership ===
In laissez-faire or free-rein leadership, decision-making is passed on to the subordinates. (The phrase is French and literally means &quot;let them do&quot;). Subordinates are given the right and power to make decisions to establish goals and work out the problems or hurdles, and are given a high degree of independence and freedom to formulate their own objectives and ways to achieve them.

===Task-oriented===
Task-oriented leadership is a style characterized by a leader&#x27;s concentration on the necessary tasks to achieve specific production objectives. Leaders following this approach emphasize the creation of systematic solutions for given problems or goals, ensuring strict adherence to deadlines, and achieving targeted outcomes.

Unlike leaders who prioritize accommodating group members, those with a task-oriented approach concentrate on obtaining precise solutions to fulfill production aims. Consequently, they are skilled at ensuring timely goal attainment, although the well-being of their group members might be compromised. These leaders maintain an unwavering focus on both the overall goal and the assigned tasks for each team member.

=== Relationship-oriented ===

Relationship-oriented leadership is a style in which the leader focuses on the relationships amongst the group and is generally more concerned with the overall well-being and satisfaction of group members. Relationship-oriented leaders emphasize communication within the group, show trust and confidence in group members, and show appreciation for work done.

Relationship-oriented leaders are focused on developing the team and the relationships in it. The positives to having this kind of environment are that team members are more motivated and have support. However, the emphasis on relations as opposed to getting a job done might make productivity suffer.

===Paternalism===

Paternalism leadership styles often reflect a father-figure mindset. The structure of team is organized hierarchically where the leader is viewed above the followers. The leader also provides both professional and personal direction in the lives of the members. Members&#x27; choices are limited due to the rigid direction given by the leader.

The term paternalism is from the Latin meaning &quot;father&quot;. The leader is most often a male. This leadership style is often found in Russia, Africa, and Pacific Asian Societies.

===Servant leadership===
With the transformation into a knowledge society, the concept of servant leadership has become more popular, notably through modern technology management styles such as Agile. In this style, the leadership is externalized from the leader who serves as a guardian of the methodology and a &quot;servant&quot; or service provider to the team they lead. The cohesion and common direction of the team is dictated by a common culture, common goals and sometimes a specific methodology. This style is different from the laissez-faire in that the leader constantly works towards reaching the common goals as a team, but without giving explicit directions on tasks.

=== Transactional and Transformational Leadership ===

Transactional leadership refers to an exchange relationship between a leader and followers in which they both strive to meet their own self-interests. The term transactional leadership was introduced by Weber in 1947. There are several forms of transactional leadership, the first being contingent reward, in which the leader outlines what the follower must do to be rewarded for the effort. The second form of transactional leadership is management-by-exception, in which the leader monitors performance of the follower and takes corrective action if standards are not met. Finally transactional leaders may be laissez-faire, avoiding taking any action at all.

Transformational leadership refers to a leader who moves beyond immediate self interests using idealized influence (charisma), inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation (creativity), or individualized consideration. Idealized influence and inspirational motivation are when a leader is able to envision and communicate a mutually desirable future state. Intellectual stimulation is when a leader helps their followers to become more creative and innovative. Individualized consideration is when a leader pays attention to the developmental needs of their followers, supporting and coaching them. A transformational leader is one who lead others to lead themselves.

==Gender and leadership==

The leadership dynamic is affected by the leader’s gender, gender diversity of groups, and the gendered nature of organizations, national cultures, and other contexts.

Much research has focused on gender of the leader, with an emphasis on women’s leadership. Women continue to be underrepresented in leadership positions, experience a gender pay gap, and face discrimination and stereotypes that limit their emergence as leaders. And yet, scholars have often found women to be equal if not more effective as leaders than men. Major topics of interest have included leadership traits, behaviors, styles, emergence, and effectiveness, as well as the situational, cultural, and individual variables that moderate gender difference effects. Scholars are increasingly interested in and beginning to include intersex, nonbinary and transgender leaders, men as gendered leaders, and how intersections between gender and other social identities affect leadership.

Less research has been conducted regarding how the gender diversity of teams and organizations affects the leadership dynamic. Contextual factors greatly influence research results. Studies have found that gender diversity can both help and hinder team performance, or have neutral effects. A leaders’ communication of vision can improve the benefits of gender-diverse teams. Joan Acker identified how organizations can embed gender into organizational cultures, practices, structures, interactions, identity, and organizational logic. Acker’s work initiated a great deal of theoretical interest, but empirical studies using the gendered organization theory are still emerging.

Globalization and national culture also affect the leadership dynamic. Women have less access to positions of power in some countries. Scholars have discovered some universality in the traits and qualities deemed necessary for leadership across cultures, but greater variance when it comes to leader-follower relationships, perceptions, and stereotypes. Countries differ in the degree to which men differ from women about the stereotypes about men and women leaders, and masculine and feminine leadership. For example, in one study, when asked to envision a leader, German women imagined a male executive, while Australian and Indian women imagined both men and women. The nation in which leadership takes place may also affect men’s and women’s leadership behaviors, although the effect of nationality has been stronger than the effect of gender in multiple studies. Scholars acknowledge more research is needed on cross-cultural leadership.

==Performance==
Some researchers argued that the influence of leaders on organizational outcomes is overrated and romanticized as a result of biased attributions about leaders. Despite these assertions, however, it is largely recognized and accepted by practitioners and researchers that leadership is important, and research supports the notion that leaders do contribute to key organizational outcomes.
 To facilitate successful leadership performance it is important to understand and accurately measure it.

Job performance generally refers to behavior that contributes to organizational success. Campbell identified a number of specific types of performance dimensions; leadership was one of them. There is no consistent, overall definition of leadership performance. Many distinct conceptualizations are often lumped together under the umbrella of leadership performance. &quot;Leadership performance&quot; may refer to the career success of the individual leader, performance of the group or organization, or even leader emergence. Each of these measures can be considered conceptually distinct. While they may be related, they are different outcomes and their inclusion should depend on the applied or research focus.

A toxic leader is someone who has responsibility over a group of people or an organization, and who abuses the leader-follower relationship by leaving the group or organization in a worse-off condition than when they joined it.

=== Measuring leadership ===
Measuring leadership has proven difficult and complex—even impossible. Attempts to assess leadership performance via group performance bring in multifarious different factors. Different perceptions of leadership itself may lead to differing measuring methods. Nevertheless, leadership theoreticians have proven perversely reluctant to abandon the vague subjective qualitative popular concept of &quot;leaders&quot;.

==Traits==

Most theories in the 20th century argued that great leaders were born, not made. Later studies indicated that leadership is more complex and cannot be boiled down to a few key traits of an individual: One such trait or set of traits does not make an extraordinary leader. Scholars have found leadership traits of an individual that do not change from situation to situation—traits such as intelligence, assertiveness, or physical attractiveness. However, each key trait may be applied to situations differently, depending on the circumstances.

Determination and drive include traits such as initiative, energy, assertiveness, perseverance, and sometimes dominance. People with these traits wholeheartedly pursue their goals, work long hours, are ambitious, and often are very competitive.

Cognitive capacity includes intelligence, analytical and verbal ability, behavioral flexibility, and good judgment. Individuals with these traits can formulate solutions to difficult problems, work well under stress or deadlines, adapt to changing situations, and create well-thought-out plans for the future. Steve Jobs and Abraham Lincoln had the traits of determination and drive as well as possessing cognitive capacity, demonstrated by their ability to adapt to their continuously changing environments.

Self-confidence encompasses the traits of high self-esteem, assertiveness, emotional stability, and self-assurance. Leaders who are self-confident do not doubt themselves or their abilities and decisions. They also can project this self-confidence onto others, building their trust and commitment.

Integrity is demonstrated in leaders who are truthful, trustworthy, principled, consistent, dependable, loyal, and not deceptive. Leaders with integrity often share these values with their followers, as this trait is mainly an ethics issue. These leaders keep their word and are honest and open with their cohorts.

Sociability describes leaders who are friendly, extroverted, tactful, flexible, and interpersonally competent. Such a trait enables leaders to be accepted by the public, use diplomatic measures to solve issues, and adapt their social persona to the situation at hand. Mother Teresa was an exceptional example who embodied integrity, assertiveness, and social abilities in her diplomatic dealings with the leaders of the world.

Few great leaders encompass all of the traits listed above, but many have the ability to apply a number of them to succeed.

==Contexts==

===Cross-Cultural, International, and Global Leadership===
While many scholars conflate the concepts of cross-cultural leadership, international leadership, and global leadership, others have found useful distinctions. The Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior (GLOBE) Project is an example of cross-cultural leadership research, as it aimed to compare leadership ideals in various countries and regions. However, it looked at leaders operating within their own culture, rather than across culture. International leadership addresses the extent to which behavior by a leader from one culture is received in another culture. Global leaders are not only leaders of companies in the global economy, but also embody global competencies such as cognitive complexity, being open to new ideas, and able to deal with uncertainty. Other scholars have identified global leaders as possessing intellectual capital or &quot;global business savvy&quot; as well. Global leaders anticipate and care about the consequences of their actions as related to humanity at large.

===Organizations===

An organization that is established as an instrument or as a means for achieving defined objectives has been referred to by sociologists as a &quot;formal organization&quot;. Its design specifies how goals are subdivided and this is reflected in subdivisions of the organization. Divisions, departments, sections, positions, jobs, and tasks make up this work structure. The formal organization is expected to behave impersonally in regard to relationships with clients or with its members. According to Weber&#x27;s model, entry and subsequent advancement is by merit or seniority. Employees receive a salary and enjoy a degree of tenure that safeguards them from the arbitrary influence of superiors or of powerful clients. The higher one&#x27;s position in the hierarchy, the greater one&#x27;s presumed expertise in adjudicating problems that may arise in the course of the work carried out at lower levels of the organization. This bureaucratic structure forms the basis for the appointment of heads or chiefs of administrative subdivisions in the organization and endows them with the authority attached to their position.

In contrast to the appointed head or chief of an administrative unit, a leader emerges within the context of the &quot;informal organization&quot; that underlies the formal structure. The informal organization expresses the personal objectives and goals of the individual membership. Their objectives and goals may or may not coincide with those of the formal organization. The informal organization represents an extension of the social structures that generally characterize human life—the spontaneous emergence of groups and organizations as ends in themselves.

In prehistoric times, humanity was preoccupied with personal security, maintenance, protection, and survival. Now humanity spends a major portion of its waking hours working for organizations. The need to identify with a community that provides security, protection, maintenance, and a feeling of belonging has continued unchanged from prehistoric times. This need is met by the informal organization and its emergent, or unofficial, leaders.

Leaders emerge from within the structure of the informal organization. Their personal qualities, the demands of the situation, or a combination of these and other factors attract followers who accept their leadership within one or several overlay structures. Instead of the authority of position held by an appointed head or chief, the emergent leader wields influence or power. Influence is the ability of a person to gain co-operation from others by means of persuasion or control over rewards. Power is a stronger form of influence because it reflects a person&#x27;s ability to enforce action through the control of a means of punishment.

A leader is a person who influences a group of people towards a specific result. In this scenario, leadership is not dependent on title or formal authority. Ogbonnia defines an effective leader &quot;as an individual with the capacity to consistently succeed in a given condition and be viewed as meeting the expectations of an organization or society&quot;. John Hoyle argues that leaders are recognized by their capacity for caring for others, clear communication, and a commitment to persist. French and Raven state that there are Five Bases of Social Power: reward, coercive, legitimate, referent, and expert. Growth of each of these five types of power increases a leader&#x27;s overall power but attempting to utilize power beyond what they actually have available causes a decrease in their power instead. While a person who is appointed to a managerial position has the right to command and enforce obedience by virtue of the authority of their position, they must possess adequate personal attributes to match this authority because authority is only potentially available to them. In the absence of sufficient personal competence, a manager may be confronted by an emergent leader who can challenge her/his role in the organization and reduce it to that of a figurehead. However, only authority of position has the backing of formal sanctions. It follows that whoever wields personal influence and power can legitimize this only by gaining a formal position in a hierarchy, with commensurate authority. Leadership can be defined as one&#x27;s ability to get others to willingly follow. Every organization needs leaders at every level.

===Management===
The terms &quot;management&quot; and &quot;leadership&quot; have, in the organizational context, been used both as synonyms and with clearly differentiated meanings. However Bennis and Nanus were clear in their distinction in their frequently quoted phrase &quot;Managers are people who do things right and leaders are people who do the right thing&quot;. Debate is common about whether the use of these terms should be restricted, and reflects an awareness of the distinction made by Burns between &quot;transactional&quot; leadership (characterized by emphasis on procedures, contingent reward, and management by exception) and &quot;transformational&quot; leadership (characterized by charisma, personal relationships, and creativity). The role of leader is one in which one can try to deal with trust issues and issues derived from lacking trust.

===Group===
In contrast to individual leadership, some organizations have adopted group leadership. In this so-called shared leadership, more than one person provides direction to the group as a whole. It is furthermore characterized by shared responsibility, cooperation, and mutual influence among team members. Some organizations have taken this approach in hopes of increasing creativity, reducing costs, or downsizing. Others may see the traditional leadership of a boss as costing too much in team performance. In some situations, the team members best able to handle any given phase of the project become the temporary leaders. Additionally, as each team member has the opportunity to experience the elevated level of empowerment, it energizes staff and feeds the cycle of success.

Leaders who demonstrate persistence, tenacity, determination, and synergistic communication skills will bring out the same qualities in their groups. Good leaders use their own to energize their team and organizations and lead a team to achieve success.

According to the National School Boards Association (U.S.A.), these group leaderships or leadership teams have these specific characteristics:

;Characteristics of a Team
* There must be an awareness of unity on the part of all its members.
* There must be interpersonal relationship. Members must have a chance to contribute, and to learn from and work with others.
* The members must have the ability to act together toward a common goal.

;Ten characteristics of well-functioning teams
# Purpose: Members proudly share a sense of why the team exists and are invested in accomplishing its mission and goals.
# Priorities: Members know what needs to be done next, by whom, and by when to achieve team goals.
# Roles: Members know their roles in getting tasks done and when to allow a more skillful member to do a certain task.
# Decisions: Authority and decision-making lines are clearly understood.
# Conflict: Conflict is dealt with openly and is considered important to decision-making and personal growth.
# Personal traits: Members feel their unique personalities are appreciated and well utilized.
# Norms: Group norms for working together are set and seen as standards for every one in the groups.
# Effectiveness: Members find team meetings efficient and productive and look forward to this time together.
# Success: Members know clearly when the team has met with success and share in this equally and proudly.
# Training: Opportunities for feedback and updating skills are provided and taken advantage of by team members.

===Self-leadership===
Self-leadership is a process that occurs within an individual. Self-leadership is having a developed sense of who you are, what you can achieve, and what your goals are, coupled with the ability to affect your emotions, behaviors, and communication. At the center of leadership is the person who is motivated to make the difference. Self-leadership is a way toward more effectively leading other people.

===Biology and evolution of leadership===
Mark van Vugt and Anjana Ahuja in &quot;Naturally Selected: The Evolutionary Science of Leadership&quot; present cases of leadership in non-human animals, from ants and bees to baboons and chimpanzees. They suggest that leadership has a long evolutionary history and that the same mechanisms underpinning leadership in humans appear in other social species, too. They also suggest that the evolutionary origins of leadership differ from those of dominance. In one study, van Vugt and his team looked at the relation between basal testosterone and leadership versus dominance. They found that testosterone correlates with dominance but not with leadership. This was replicated in a sample of managers in which there was no relation between hierarchical position and testosterone level.

Richard Wrangham and Dale Peterson, in &quot;Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence&quot;, present evidence that only humans and chimpanzees, among all the animals living on Earth, share a similar tendency for a cluster of behaviors: violence, territoriality, and competition for uniting behind the one chief male of the land. This position is contentious. Many animals apart from apes are territorial, compete, exhibit violence, and have a social structure controlled by a dominant male (lions, wolves, etc.), suggesting Wrangham and Peterson&#x27;s evidence is not empirical. However, we must examine other species as well, including elephants (which are matriarchal and follow an alpha female), meerkats (which are likewise matriarchal), sheep (which &quot;follow&quot; in some sense castrated bellwethers), and many others.

By comparison, bonobos, the second-closest species-relatives of humans, do &quot;not&quot; unite behind the chief male of the land. Bonobos show deference to an alpha or top-ranking female that, with the support of her coalition of other females, can prove as strong as the strongest male. Thus, if leadership amounts to getting the greatest number of followers, then among the bonobos, a female almost always exerts the strongest and most effective leadership. (Incidentally, not all scientists agree on the allegedly peaceful nature of the bonobo or with its reputation as a &quot;hippie chimp&quot;.)

==Myths==
Leadership has been described as one of the least understood concepts across all cultures and civilizations. Many researchers have stressed the prevalence of this misunderstanding, stating that several flawed assumptions, or myths, concerning leadership interfere with people&#x27;s conception of what leadership is about.

===Leadership is innate===
According to some, leadership is determined by distinctive dispositional characteristics present at birth (e.g., extraversion, intelligence, or ingenuity). However, evidence shows that leadership also develops through hard work and careful observation. Thus, effective leadership can result from nature (i.e., innate talents) as well as nurture (i.e., acquired skills).

===Leadership is possessing power over others===
Although leadership is certainly a form of power, it is not demarcated by power &quot;over&quot; people. Rather, it is a power &quot;with&quot; people that exists as a reciprocal relationship between a leader and his/her followers. Despite popular belief, the use of manipulation, coercion, and domination to influence others is not a requirement for leadership. People who seek group consent and strive to act in the best interests of others can also become effective leaders.

===Leaders are positively influential===
The validity of the assertion that groups flourish when guided by effective leaders can be illustrated using several examples. For instance, the bystander effect (failure to respond or offer assistance) that tends to develop within groups faced with an emergency is significantly reduced in groups guided by a leader. Moreover, group performance, creativity, and efficiency all tend to climb in businesses with designated managers or CEOs.

The difference leaders make is not always positive in nature. Leaders sometimes focus on fulfilling their own agendas at the expense of others, including their own followers. Leaders who focus on personal gain by employing stringent and manipulative leadership styles often make a difference, but usually do so through negative means.

===Leaders entirely control group outcomes===
In Western cultures it is generally assumed that group leaders make all the difference when it comes to group influence and overall goal-attainment. This view relates to reverence for leadership &quot;per se&quot; or for &quot;heroic charismatic leadership&quot; - a &quot;cult of leadership&quot; in the abstract (as distinct from the cult of a given leader/leadership-group or from some individual-oriented cult of personality).
This romanticized view of leadership—the tendency to overestimate the degree of control leaders have over their groups and their groups&#x27; outcomes—ignores the existence of many other factors that influence group dynamics. For example, group cohesion, communication patterns, individual personality traits, group context, the nature or orientation of the work, as well as behavioral norms and established standards influence group functionality. For this reason, it is unwarranted to assume that all leaders are in complete control of their groups&#x27; achievements.

===All groups have a designated leader===

Not all groups need have a designated leader. Groups that are primarily composed of women, are limited in size, are free from stressful decision-making, or only exist for a short period of time (e.g., student work groups; pub quiz/trivia teams) often undergo a diffusion of responsibility, in which leadership tasks and roles are shared amongst members.

===Group members resist leaders===
Group members&#x27; dependence on group leaders can lead to reduced self-reliance and overall group strength. Most people prefer to be led than to be without a leader. This &quot;need for a leader&quot; becomes especially strong in troubled groups that are experiencing some sort of conflict. Group members tend to be more contented and productive when they have a leader to guide them. Although individuals filling leadership roles can be a direct source of resentment for followers, most people appreciate the contributions that leaders make to their groups and consequently welcome the guidance of a leader.

==Action-oriented environments==
One approach to team leadership examines action-oriented environments, where effective functional leadership is required to achieve critical or reactive tasks by small teams deployed into the field. Some examples of action-oriented leadership include extinguishing a rural fire, locating a missing person, leading a team on an outdoor expedition, or rescuing a person from a potentially hazardous environment.

Leadership of small groups is often created to respond to a situation or critical incident. In most cases, these teams are tasked to operate in remote and changeable environments with limited support or backup (&quot;action environments&quot;). Leadership of people in these environments requires a different set of skills to that of leaders in front-line management. These leaders must effectively operate remotely and negotiate the needs of the individual, team, and task within a changeable environment.

Other examples include modern technology deployments of small/medium-sized IT teams into client plant sites. Leadership of these teams requires hands-on experience and a lead-by-example attitude to empower team members to make well thought-out and concise decisions independent of executive management and/or home-base decision-makers. Early adoption of Scrum and Kanban branch development methodologies helped to alleviate the dependency that field teams had on trunk-based development. This method of just-in-time action oriented development and deployment allowed remote plant sites to deploy up-to-date software patches frequently and without dependency on core team deployment schedules, satisfying the clients&#x27; needs to rapidly patch production environment bugs.

==Critical thought==

The ideas of Edmund Burke (1729–1797) on representative (as opposed to delegate-based) democracy have echoes in the attitudes of elected representatives who regard themselves - and even portray themselves - as &quot;leaders&quot;.

Carlyle&#x27;s 1840 &quot;Great Man theory&quot;, which emphasized the role of leading individuals, met opposition (from Herbert Spencer, Leo Tolstoy, and others) in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Karl Popper noted in 1945 that leaders can mislead and make mistakes—he warns against deferring to &quot;great men&quot;.

Noam Chomsky
and others have subjected the concept of leadership to critical thinking and assert that people abrogate their responsibility to think and will actions for themselves. While the conventional view of leadership may satisfy people who &quot;want to be told what to do&quot;, these critics say that one should question subjection to a will or intellect other than one&#x27;s own if the leader is not a subject-matter expert.

Concepts such as autogestion, employeeship, and common civic virtue challenge the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the leadership principle by stressing individual responsibility and/or group authority in the workplace and elsewhere and by focusing on the skills and attitudes that a person needs in general rather than separating out &quot;leadership&quot; as the basis of a special class of individuals.

Various historical calamities (such as World War II) can be attributed
to a misplaced reliance on the principle of leadership () as exhibited in dictatorship.

David John Farmer writes critically of the leader principle and of the cult in which elements throughout society - even in democratic countries - pay deference to the idea of leadership.

The idea of leaderism paints leadership and its excesses in a negative light.

<text>Brains in Bahrain was an eight-game chess match between World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik and the computer program Deep Fritz 7, held in October 2002. The match ended in a tie 4-4, with two wins for each participant and four draws.

==Outcome of games==
The first game was drawn. Kramnik won games 2 and 3 by &quot;conventional&quot; anti-computer tactics—play conservatively for a long-term advantage the computer is not able to see in its game tree search. After a draw in game 4, Kramnik lost game 5 due to a blunder. Game 6 was described by commentators as &quot;spectacular&quot;. Kramnik, in a better position in the early middlegame, sacrificed a piece to launch an attack—a strategy known to be highly risky against computers, which are at their strongest when defending such attacks. True to form, Fritz found a watertight defense and Kramnik was left in a bad position. Kramnik resigned the game, believing his position to be lost. However, post-game analysis has shown that Fritz was unlikely to have been able to force a win—Kramnik gave up a drawn position. The final two games were draws.

==Selection of Fritz and creation of Deep Fritz==
Fritz had been chosen to play Kramnik by winning a qualifying event in Cadaques, Spain in 2001. The other competing program was Junior; the reigning world computer chess champion Shredder declined an invitation to compete. The 24-game match started very poorly for Fritz, which lost five games in a row before coming back strongly in the last ten games to tie the series and finally win the play-off. Fritz became Deep Fritz when its hardware was extended to an eight-processor machine for the competition.

==Advantages==
Kramnik was given several advantages in his match against Fritz when compared to most other Man vs. Machine matches, such as the one Garry Kasparov lost against Deep Blue in 1997. The code of Fritz was frozen some time before the first match and Kramnik was given a copy of Fritz to practice with for several months. Another difference was that in games lasting more than 56 moves, Kramnik was allowed to adjourn until the following day, during which time he could use his copy of Fritz to aid him in his overnight analysis of the position.

<text>Fairview is a city in Multnomah County, Oregon, United States. The population was 10,424 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Members of the Multnomah tribe of Chinookan Indians lived in a village on Sauvie Island by the Columbia River (the future site of Fairview) when the Lewis and Clark Expedition visited the area in 1806. By the 1840s and 1850s, white settlers began hay, grain, and livestock operations in what would become eastern Multnomah County. Railroad tracks extended to the area by the 1890s. As the population grew, it may be assumed that residents began referring to the locale as Fairview because of the pleasing views of the nearby Columbia, the Columbia River Gorge, and Mount Hood, though an alternative testimony explains this name originated from the area&#x27;s ideal lookout spot for approaching hostile natives. Since another community named Fairview already existed on the Oregon Coast, the community&#x27;s first post office was named Cleone until the coastal post office closed and the name was transferred to Fairview.

In the mid-1980s, the city attempted to annex a large section of unincorporated territory in eastern Multnomah County. The plan would have created a city of about 120,000 residents, which at the time would have ranked as the second most populous city in Oregon, behind only Portland. In September 1985, the Oregon Supreme Court ruled that the attempt was invalid as state law required two cities to start any attempt at consolidation, and only Fairview had initiated this attempt.

A large Fairview employer is Townsend Farms, which operates a berry freezing cannery. In 2020 the company had approximately 350 employees in the region, with 450 seasonal workers; it was the source of a Hepatitis A outbreak in pomegranate seeds in 2013 that infected 127 people in 8 states. The product was recalled under its Townsend Farms brand at Costco and private labeled at Harris Teeter, and later linked to Goknur Foodstuffs Import Export Trading in Turkey by the FDA. The cannery itself had a COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, which may have caused two waves of infections affecting at least 48 people.

<text>Gresham ( ) is a city in the Willamette Valley, Located in Multnomah County in the U.S. state of Oregon, bordered by Portland to the northwest and partially in the southwest. It was first settled in the early 1850s by the Powell brothers. It remained unincorporated until 1905; it was named after Walter Quintin Gresham, an American Civil War general and United States Secretary of State.

The early economy of the city was primarily supported by agriculture, and by the mid-20th century, the city saw a population boom, increasing from 4,000 residents to more than 10,000 between 1960 and 1970. The population was 114,247 at the 2020 census, making it the second most populous city in the county and the fourth-most populous city in Oregon. Gresham is an economic center for eastern Multnomah County.

==History==

The area now known as Gresham was first settled in 1851 by brothers Jackson and James Powell, who laid claim to land under the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850 and named the settlement Powell&#x27;s Valley. In 1884, a local merchant petitioned for a post office from the United States Post Office Department to be established in his store, proposing to name it after Postmaster General Walter Q. Gresham if his request was granted. Concurrently, other community members secured a post office named &quot;Campground,&quot; which referred to the area&#x27;s religious camp meeting site and its convenience as a stop for travelers heading to Portland. Once the Post Office Department recognized its error, it revoked the Campground post office designation.

Gresham was incorporated in 1905, the year of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition; its population at the time was 365. Lewis Shattuck, a member of a pioneer family, served as the first mayor. The local economy was primarily driven by agriculture, particularly the cultivation of berries, grapes, and vegetables. During that period, trains operated between Gresham and Portland on an hourly schedule. Gresham&#x27;s early settlers would go on to form the outlying communities of Boring, Sandy, Fairview, and Estacada.

Gresham&#x27;s city library, which began as a small book collection in the town&#x27;s general store, was officially established as the Gresham Branch Public Library in 1913 with a grant from the Andrew Carnegie library fund.

<doc id="130922" wikidata="Q2270006" url="?curid=130922" title="Maywood Park, Oregon">
<text>Maywood Park is a city in Multnomah County, Oregon, United States. The name came from a comment made by the wife of the man who developed the original subdivision, E. F. Taylor, who remarked one winter night how attractive the woods were in May. An enclave within the city of Portland, the residents of the city voted to incorporate in 1967 in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the construction of Interstate 205. The population was 829 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1926, Columbia Realty purchased the triangular plot of land on which Maywood Park stands. The parcel was later purchased by Commonwealth Inc., which made plans to create a subdivision modeled after the Laurelhurst and Eastmoreland neighborhoods of Portland. Although the Great Depression delayed development of the land, construction was largely completed by 1943 with about 400 homes. Maywood Park was so large it crossed over where I-205 is today.

In 1967, the residents of Maywood Park voted to incorporate as a city in an attempt to prevent Interstate 205 from cutting through the neighborhood. Although the effort was ultimately unsuccessful, resulting in the loss of 82 homes on the west side, Maywood Park was able to gain noise reduction concessions from the construction of I-205. Specifically, I-205 is built below grade as it passes by Maywood Park, and a sound wall and green belt provide further noise reduction.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. The city is contained in a trapezoid bordered by NE Prescott Street to the north, NE 102nd Avenue to the east, I-205 to the south, and NE 92nd Avenue (across I-205) to the west, plus the eastern side of 92nd Avenue to Sandy Boulevard.

<doc id="130923" wikidata="Q426942" url="?curid=130923" title="Troutdale, Oregon">
<text>Troutdale is a city in Multnomah County, Oregon, United States, immediately north of Gresham and east of Wood Village. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 16,300. The city serves as the western gateway to the Historic Columbia River Highway, the Mount Hood Scenic Byway, and the Columbia River Gorge. It is approximately east of Portland and is part of the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area.

==History==
The community was once known as Sandy, after the nearby Sandy River; the post office in Sandy was established in 1854 and closed in 1868. In 1873, the current city of Sandy in Clackamas County, which was formerly named &quot;Revenue&quot;, established a different Sandy post office that is still in operation. Troutdale was named by pioneer John Harlow for the trout pond in a dale near his house. Troutdale post office was founded in 1880. In 1925, a company, the Bissinger Wool Pullery, was moved from Sellwood, Oregon, and opened for business on Macadam Road along the west bank of the Sandy River. An iconic water tower stands nearby. The company was featured in a Ripley&#x27;s Believe it or Not! column because a cat was reportedly found in a stack of animal hides that the company was going to use for its products. The cat was taken care of and became the company&#x27;s mascot, and was said to have lived a long and healthy life. The water tower is now known as the &quot;Old Historic Water Tower&quot;.

Reynolds Aluminum was once the area&#x27;s biggest employer. The Reynolds plant in Troutdale was established in 1941 to provide aluminum for the war effort. The plant closed in 2000. The nearby city of Wood Village was a company town founded to house workers from the Reynolds plant.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Troutdale is located at the confluence of the Sandy and Columbia rivers.

The city is about east of Portland.

===Climate===
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above . According to the Köppen climate classification system, Troutdale has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.

Troutdale is renowned for having some of the windiest conditions in the Pacific Northwest. Periodically, strong east winds emerge from the Columbia River Gorge that affect the city&#x27;s temperature and general climate.

<text>Dallas is a city and the county seat of Polk County, Oregon, United States. The population was 16,854 at the 2020 census.

Dallas is along Rickreall Creek, about west of Salem, at an elevation of above sea level. It is part of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Pioneers in the 1840s started the settlement that became known as Dallas on the north side of Rickreall Creek. It was originally named &quot;Cynthian&quot; or &quot;Cynthiana&quot;. A 1947 &quot;Itemizer-Observer&quot; article states: &quot;[T]he town was called Cynthiana after Cynthiana, Ky., so named by Mrs. Thos. Lovelady.&quot; According to the county historical society in 1987, Mrs. Thomas J. Lovelady named the new settlement after her home town of Cynthiana, Kentucky.

Another source claims that Cynthia Ann, wife of early pioneer Jesse Applegate, named the settlement. But they lived in the Salt Creek area of northern Polk County and, according to the 1850 Federal Census, she was not living in Polk County then.

Dallas post office was established in 1852. In 1856, the town was moved more than a mile south because of an inadequate supply of water.

Cynthiana competed with Independence to be selected as the county seat. Its residents raised $17,000 in order to have a branch of the narrow gauge railroad constructed to their town, which secured them the honor and related economic stimulus. The line was built from 1878–80. Town leaders believed a more sturdy sounding name was needed for a county seat. Since George Mifflin Dallas was vice-president under James K. Polk, for whom the county was named, they named it &quot;Dallas&quot;.

Dallas was incorporated as a town in 1874 and as a city in 1901.

===Gerlinger family===
After Louis Gerlinger, Sr. incorporated the Salem, Falls City and Western Railway Company late in October 1901, he announced plans to build a railroad from the Willamette River at Salem to the mouth of the Siletz River on the Oregon Coast, a distance of .

In 1902, Louis&#x27;s son George T. Gerlinger organized a group of investors to build related railroad lines in the area. On May 29, 1903, the first train ran from Dallas to Falls City. At the end of June, passenger trains began regularly scheduled, daily trips to and from Dallas and Falls City; the , 40-minute, one-way trip cost 35 cents.

Willamette Industries was founded in Dallas in 1906. At that time the company name was Willamette Valley Lumber Company. Louis Gerlinger, Sr. was president of the new company and H. L. Pittock, vice president. George T. Gerlinger served as secretary and manager, and F. W. Leadbetter was treasurer. George Cone served as director and mill superintendent. In 1967, Willamette Valley Lumber and several others merged to become Willamette Industries.

In the early 21st century, this and other local businesses were taken over by others from outside, which eventually affected the local economy. In March 2002, Willamette Industries was officially acquired by Weyerhaeuser Company in a hostile takeover. In early 2009, Weyerhaeuser&#x27;s Mill formally closed the Dallas operation. Similarly, Gerlinger Carrier Company in Dallas was taken over by Towmotor.

<doc id="130926" wikidata="Q2360525" url="?curid=130926" title="Eola, Oregon">
<text>Eola is an unincorporated community in Polk County, Oregon, United States. It lies four miles west of Salem on Oregon Route 22 at the confluence of Rickreall Creek and the Willamette River.

For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Eola as a census-designated place (CDP). The census definition of the area may not precisely correspond to local understanding of the area with the same name. The population of the CDP was 60 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The Eola Hills rise north of the community and were named after it.

==History==
Eola was originally named Cincinnati in 1844 by settlers Joshua &quot;Sheep&quot; Shaw and his son, A. C. R. Shaw, who thought the site resembled Cincinnati, Ohio, where Joshua once lived. Joshua Shaw earned his nickname by being the first person to bring sheep overland to the Oregon Country via the Oregon Trail, also in 1844.

Cincinnati post office was established in 1851, the first stop on a 70-mile mail route that included Nathaniel Ford&#x27;s home in Rickreall and Nesmith&#x27;s Mills at Ellendale.

The Oregon Territorial Legislature incorporated the community with the name &quot;Eola&quot; in 1856. The name comes from &quot;Aeolus&quot;, Greek god of the winds, though the reason for the name change is disputed.

Cincinnati post office was also renamed. Eola post office ran until 1901 and was later reestablished from 1955 to 1965.

The first school in Eola (then Cincinnati) was built in 1853. Miss Abigail J. Scott, best known by her married name as the suffragist Abigail Scott Duniway, was the first teacher. The original school burned down and was replaced by a school at Second and Mill streets in 1858. This school served the community until 1937, and at the time was the oldest schoolhouse still in use in the state. In 1937, a new school was built using a Works Progress Administration grant. This building served as a public school facility until 2003. Today the building is used as a church.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 49 people, 29 households, and 6 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 36 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 89.80% White, 8.16% from other races, and 2.04% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 8.16% of the population.

There were 29 households, out of which 3.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 20.7% were married couples living together, and 75.9% were non-families. 69.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.69 and the average family size was 3.14.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 10.2% under the age of 18, 4.1% from 18 to 24, 26.5% from 25 to 44, 49.0% from 45 to 64, and 10.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 50 years. For every 100 females, there were 122.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 131.6 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $12,361 and the per capita income was $9,489. There were no families and 29.8% of the population living below the poverty line, including no people under eighteen and none of those over 64.

<text>Falls City is a city in Polk County, Oregon, United States. The population was 1,051 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

<text>Grand Ronde is a census-designated place (CDP) and unincorporated community in Polk and Yamhill counties, Oregon, United States. Historically noted as a village in Polk County, the sphere of influence and community is in both Polk and Yamhill counties. The name of the community is a variation of the French &quot;Grande Ronde&quot; or &quot;Grand Round&quot; which could be about the large round-up of Native American peoples in the area who were settled on what was known as the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation, or possibly referencing the shape of the valley in which the community is located. As of the census of 2010, there were 1,661 people in 658 households residing in Grand Ronde. It is part of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
On January 4, 1855, a treaty between the various bands of Kalapuyans and Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs Joel Palmer was effected, calling for the various bands to remove to a reservation to be established by the government. For this purpose the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation was opened on June 30, 1857, covering 60,000 acres in northwest Polk and southwest Yamhill counties. A census conducted in 1870 reported only 47 Yamels and 36 Luckiamutes on the reservation; in 1910 the Yamels numbered five, the Luckiamutes, eight. By the end of the historic period, the Kalapuyan people no longer existed as a distinct cultural-racial entity.

According to a Cultural Resources Report from the Oregon Department of Transportation, the town of Grand Ronde began as &quot;New Grand Ronde&quot; in about 1908 when the first large groups of Indians were leaving the Reservation and establishing their own farms and ranches under the Dawes Act. In 1921, International Harvester laid out a town site. In 1922 the company built nine miles of track from Willamina to Grand Ronde, calling it the Willamina and Grand Ronde Railroad. The short railroad connected the area with the Southern Pacific railroad at Willamina. The railroad helped the timber industry to flourish and made it possible for lumber mills to grow and dominate the economy of the area. Grand Ronde became the center of support services for mill workers and a train depot, store, hotel, movie theater, diner, gas station, bank, post office, church, and a small residential area were built.

The Spaulding-Miami Lumber Company created and owned the town proper in the early 1920s as part of its logging operations. A rail line and several related buildings were built as well as a hotel. A spur of the railroad headed south out of the town across Rock Creek and into the coastal range. Electricity was brought to the town in 1922 according to the Lumber World Review, Volume 42, published in January 1922.

The Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community own and operate Spirit Mountain Casino, which is a major local employer. In 1997, the casino created the Spirit Mountain Community Fund, which supports several charities both within Polk County and throughout Oregon from the casino&#x27;s gambling revenue. In January 2010, the CDP was expanded to include areas located inside Yamhill County.

There was quite a bit of communication about the name of the town going back and forth between the Oregon Geographic Board and the United States Geographic Board starting in 1919. Initially, the State was calling for the town to be officially named &quot;Grande Ronde&quot; using the typical French spelling, (possibly due to the history of French Canadian fur trapping in the area via the Hudson Bay Company), though through research and correspondence lasting into the early 1940s, the name as spelled currently, &quot;Grand Ronde&quot;, was made official.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land. The community is located above sea-level.

This area is considered to be in Eco Sub-Region 3c by data published by Oregon State University and is described as &quot;The nearly level to undulating Prairie Terraces ecoregion includes all of the terraces of the Willamette River upstream of the Portland/Vancouver Basin (3a). Ecoregion 3c is drained by low-gradient, meandering streams and rivers. Its broad fluvial terraces once supported oak savanna and prairies that were maintained by burning; wetter areas supported Oregon ash and black cottonwood. Today, only relict native prairie remains. The poorly drained soils derived from glacio-lacustrine deposits are extensively farmed for grass seed and small grains. Grasses tolerate poor drainage and poor rooting conditions better than other crops. In addition to agriculture, the Prairie Terraces also experience the bulk of urban expansion&quot;

===Climate===
The overall climate of Grand Ronde can be considered a temperate climate. This is characteristic of areas with wet, mild winters and warm, dry summers.

Grand Ronde is located in the Oregon Coast Range, which is one of the wettest places in the contiguous United States. Precipitation data has been gathered in Grand Ronde sporadically since 1910 and continuously since 1948. That data shows the average annual precipitation from 1971 to 2000 to be .

In contrast, rainfall in Willamina, approximately away, is . Additionally, precipitation at Laurel Mountain, located about to the southeast and further up in the Oregon Coast Range, comes down at an average rate of per year.

<text>Independence is a city in Polk County, Oregon, United States, on the west bank of the Willamette River along Oregon Route 51, and east of nearby Monmouth. It is part of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area. Thirty square blocks of the oldest part of Independence form the National Register of Historic Places-listed Independence Historic District.

The population was 9,828 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Independence was founded by pioneers who migrated from Independence, Missouri. Elvin A. Thorp arrived in the Independence area in 1845 and staked a claim north of Ash Creek in June of that year. He platted a small townsite that later became known as &quot;Thorp&#x27;s Town of Independence&quot; or the &quot;Original Town of Independence&quot;, now known as &quot;Old Town&quot;. Thorp named the town for his eponymous hometown in Missouri, as well as in honor of Andrew Jackson&#x27;s characteristic of &quot;Independence&quot;.

In 1847, Henry Hill came across the plains looking for a level piece of ground on which to raise stock. On November 14, 1847, he found his location on the west bank of the Willamette River (south of Ash Street) and marked off his donation land claim, which was square. In 1867, after returning from the California gold mines, Hill platted for a townsite, thereafter to be referred to as Henry Hill&#x27;s Town of Independence. The city charter bill of February 26, 1885, incorporated E.A. Thorp&#x27;s Independence and Henry Hill&#x27;s Independence. Henry Hill Elementary School was named in honor of the latter.

Flood of 1861

When the pioneers first arrived in Independence, the Kalapuya people, who had lived in the area for centuries, warned them about the dangers of flooding along the Willamette River. The Kalapuya had experienced devastating floods in the past, which had even swept away their horses.

In December 1861, a devastating flood struck Independence, wiping out the town&#x27;s commercial district, farms, and livestock. The flood was the result of a prolonged period of rain that began in October and continued into November, compounded by snow accumulation in the Cascades. As temperatures rose in late November, the snow melted, leading to severe flooding by the first week of December.

Mrs. Cora Hubbard, in her book &quot;Early Settlement of Independence&quot;, states that during the flood &quot;a person could row a boat across Thorp’s entire Town of Independence.&quot; The flood destroyed much of the town&#x27;s infrastructure, including warehouses, docks, and ferries along Water Street. A warehouse filled with wheat was also destroyed.

After the waters receded, the residents of Independence, along with Henry Hill returning from the California Gold Mines, began considering the possibility of rebuilding the town on higher ground, just across Ash Creek. They came up with a plan to establish a new townsite on more stable land. In 1867, Hill made the decision to move forward with the plan, choosing a 40-acre plot of land that bordered the Willamette River south of Ash Creek to build his &quot;Henry Hill&#x27;s Town of Independence&quot;.
Economic History and Transportation Development

Independence thrived as a shipping point, by both rail and boat, for agricultural products and lumber until the 1950s. The city was known for its hops production from the 1890s through the 1940s, hosting a festival called the &quot;Hops Fiesta&quot; from the early 1930s to the mid-1950s. When hop production began to decline in the early 1950s, the city&#x27;s fortunes also began to decline.

Downtown Independence was bypassed by major freeways in the 1960s, though the period saw an alternative form of transportation enabled by the construction of the Independence State Airport, which was dedicated on August 14, 1964.

<text>Monmouth () is a city in Polk County in the U.S. state of Oregon. It was named for Monmouth, Illinois, the origin of its earliest settlers. The population is 11,110 at the 2020 Census and it is part of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Monmouth was settled in 1853 by a group of pioneers who allocated to build both a city and a &quot;college under the auspices of the Christian Church&quot;, and proceeds from the sale of these lands were used to found Monmouth University, currently known as Western Oregon University. 
For decades, Monmouth was a dry town that banned the sale of alcoholic beverages in supermarkets, restaurants and bars. Monmouth&#x27;s status as the last dry town in Oregon was ended by a popular vote in the November 2002 election.

===Prohibition===
Monmouth was settled by Elijah Davidson and his family. Originally an elder of the Christian Church of Cameron (Monmouth, Illinois), Davidson was a devout advocate of prohibition. In 1850, sixty-seven-year-old Elijah Davidson and his family set out for Oregon Territory. By 1854, more than a dozen additional church of Christ families from Monmouth, many of them related to each other or to Davidson, had joined him. In February 1859, Davidson and other trustees efforts to prohibit the importation, exportation, sale, and consumption of alcohol in Monmouth became a reality. One of the main arguments Davidson and his fellow religious supporters used to push prohibition legislation was, &quot;to enable them to suppress and prevent nuisances, to render the possession of life and property more secure, [and] to enable them to improve and embellish the streets of the town.&quot;

Despite the efforts of certain merchants to repeal prohibition in Monmouth throughout its history, their efforts proved fruitless. What was most important to the local religious community was to keep prohibition for the betterment of the social order of Monmouth. Although opponents raised religious, moral, economic, and quality-of-life arguments similar to those preached during the nineteenth century, they also brought two new arguments to center stage: the historic nature of Monmouth&#x27;s prohibition and the uniqueness that local prohibition brought to the town.

Eventually support for the prohibition ordinance started to wear thin throughout the community of Monmouth. Although die-hard supporters of prohibition continued to fight the inevitable, there were signs that it was starting to become more and more detrimental to the social and economic aspects of the community. Some claim that prohibition had reduced property values, others that it restricted development of the business sector in town. Opponents of repeal brought forth many arguments for staying dry, including initiating one rumor that the land donated so long ago for the site of the university would revert to the heirs of the donors if the ordinance was repealed, resulting in a huge cost to the state to repurchase it.

After failing by a nearly 5 to 1 margin in the early 1970s, repeal was passed by the voters in November 2002, and Monmouth ended its long tenure as the last dry town on the west coast.

<text>Biggs Junction is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Sherman County, Oregon, United States.

== History ==
Biggs is a station on the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) at what was once a junction with the UP&#x27;s Grass Valley line to Kent that has since been abandoned. Biggs was named for a nearby landowner, W. H. Biggs, who settled in Sherman County in 1880. W. H. Biggs was born on May 12, 1831; he was from Ohio. The rail line was originally owned by the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (OR&amp;N). In 1885 the OR&amp;N station at Biggs was called Spanish Hollow, after the canyon that opens on the river there. The canyon was said to be named because a Spanish ox died there in the days of the Oregon Trail, which runs parallel to U.S. 97. Biggs is where travelers on the Oregon Trail would first see the Columbia River after their overland journey. The current community of Biggs Junction was named for the station, which is less than a mile west of the current junction, and its location at the intersection of I-84 and U.S. 97. Biggs post office was established in 1884 and closed in 1954.

Giles French park is an excellent location for birdwatching and short term free camping. 

Rufus is also home to archaeological site 35SH119, where various Native American groups quarried petrified wood and other materials for stone tool creation.

The quarry site is located on the west end of Rufus in what is now the Gorge Vista subdivision. The lack of human remains and datable artifacts meant that this archeological site was not recommended for inclusion in the national register of historic sites and only the original survey post marks the location of the quarry.

<text>Garibaldi ( ) is a city in Tillamook County, in the U.S. state of Oregon. The population was 830 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The indigenous Tillamook people have lived along the Oregon coast –including the Tillamook Bay– for about 12,000 years; from Tillamook Head in the North, to Cape Foulweather in the south, and extending inland to the summit of the Oregon Coast Range. They lived in permanent cedar-plank lodges, illuminated at night with torches or by burning fish heads or whale oil. Their diet included salmon, mussels, lampreys, berries, wild mustard, camas, grouse, beaver, deer, and elk.

Captain Robert Gray, born in Rhode Island and sailing from Boston, sailed the &quot;Lady Washington&quot; into Tillamook Bay in 1788, where his crew fought with the Tillamook people. The Lewis and Clark expedition recorded in 1806 that 2,400 Tillamook people resided on Oregon&#x27;s coast. As the white settler population increased, indigenous people suffered from newly introduced diseases including smallpox. By 1930 only 22 indigenous people remained in all of Tillamook County.

Daniel Bayley was the first white property owner on this part of Tillamook Bay, having first settled here after the Civil War. Bayley was one of the first white settlers who arrived in Tillamook Bay&#x27;s northern end area. Bayley built a hotel and general store on what is now known as Bay Lane. In 1867, Bayley subdivided the Bayley Park Addition and was officially granted title to the property on May 15, 1869, by President Ulysses S. Grant. In 1870, he was appointed by President Grant as the area&#x27;s first postmaster and given the duty of naming the postmark. This same year, Giuseppe Garibaldi helped unify Italy after a military career devoted to establishing democracy around the world and Bayley felt so inclined to name the post office after his hero.

Starting in the 1870s, the region&#x27;s indigenous people were relocated to the nearby Hobsonville Indian Community. By the 1930s, this community was composed mostly of elderly women and children, and given the nickname &quot;Squawtown&quot;. Tourists and antiquities dealers would visit, and the local Ku Klux Klan occasionally harassed the residents. The community was abandoned by WWII, and some residents moved to Garibaldi.

Garibaldi&#x27;s first school (Hobson School) was built in 1896. In 1907 the school was moved close to where it now stands between Cypress and Driftwood under the big &quot;G&quot;. In 1926, the new high school opened so Garibaldi students no longer had to attend secondary school in Bay City. In 1954, north Tillamook County high schools were consolidated as Neah-Kah-Nie High School north of Rockaway Beach. Garibaldi High School became a grade school.

The Whitney mill was opened in 1921. The tall smokestack, today all that remains, was constructed by the Hammond Company in 1927–28.

Garibaldi was incorporated as a City in 1946. During the 1950s the city&#x27;s population increased to over 1500 with the construction of two large mills, The Oceanside Lumber Company and Oregon-Washington Plywood Corporation. The Oregon-Washington Mill closed in the late 1970s. Weyerhaeuser hardwood mill at the Port of Garibaldi was acquired in 2011 by a New York-based company and has been operating as Northwest Hardwoods, Inc. since the acquisition.

In 2020, writer Helen Hill suggested removing Garibaldi&#x27;s statue of Captain Robert Gray, due to claims about his treatment of indigenous people. The statue, which stands outside the Garibaldi Maritime Museum, depicts Gray standing on a sacred box with Haida designs. , the museum&#x27;s board will consider adding information next to the statue.

At least two of Oregon&#x27;s historical shipwrecks occurred off the Manzanita coast: the &quot;Glenesslin&quot; in 1913&quot;,&quot; and the &quot;Santo Cristo de Burgos&quot; (disappeared 1693) which has generated rumors of treasure buried on Neahkahnie Mountain.

Manzanita was platted as a beach resort in 1912. Manzanita post office was established in 1914 and named for the manzanita (&quot;Arctostaphylos&quot; sp.) plants that grow in the area. &quot;Manzanita&quot; means &#x27;little apple&#x27; in Spanish.

===Tornado===

On the morning of October 14, 2016, an EF2 tornado, which had begun as a waterspout, hit Manzanita. Many buildings in the town were damaged, but no injuries were reported. The mayor of Manzanita declared a state of emergency in response.

<text>Nehalem is a city in Tillamook County, Oregon, United States. Incorporated in 1889, the city lies along the Nehalem River and Nehalem Bay near the Pacific Ocean. It is bisected by U.S. Route 101. The population was 355 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Nehalem was named for the Nehalem tribe of Native American Indians, also known as the Tillamook People, who traditionally inhabited the area. In the native Salishan languages, Nehalem means &quot;place where people live&quot; Early variations of the name include &quot;Naalem&quot; and &quot;Ne-ay-lem.&quot;

The city of Nehalem was established by European Americans in the latter portion of the nineteenth century, rapidly thriving with logging, fishing, and shipping. In June 1913, Joseph C. Smith became the town&#x27;s first mayor. Prior to 1913, the town was governed by elected trustees.

As the Northwestern logging industry slowed during the twentieth century, the city&#x27;s economy also cooled. The city used to stretch over the river on log planks, where a lumber mill cut logs that came down a railroad track on the Nehalem River. Wood pilings that held up this track can be found in the North Fork Nehalem River. On the front of Nehalem Elementary School is a facade which proclaims &quot;Union High School&quot; from when the area was less populated and could support its own Elementary and high schools. Currently there is an elementary school and a community pool/rec. center run by the North County Recreation District which hosts a number of classes including those for Tillamook Bay Community College.

According to the October 1977 of La Posta Postal History Journal, Nehalem&#x27;s post office was established in August 1870. It was originally located in the home of Samuel Corwin. In February 1884, the name of the Nehalem Post Office was changed to &quot;Onion Peak&quot; when John Alley became the postmaster and moved the post office to his home, which was standard practice for the time. Because Alley&#x27;s home was considerably north of the original Nehalem town site, Alley requested a name change to &quot;Onion Peak,&quot; a nearby mountain and prominent geographic feature of the area. In May 1884, Nehalem residents petitioned for a new post office closer to town. The request was granted with Henry Ober serving as postmaster. The Onion Peak Post Office closed in 1893.

For many decades the State highway officials in Oregon had seen the route that Highway 101 took through Wheeler and Nehalem as temporary for the highway. During that time, the long-term plan for the highway was to move it along the Nehalem Spit, offering a longer view of Nehalem Bay and the Pacific Ocean. When the plans for this change began to take shape in the late 1960s the community backlash from the two towns was so intense that officials decided to leave the highway in its existing layout.

Nehalem has an elevation of 11 feet. Lying so close to sea level, the area suffers intermittent floods. A 1996 storm caused particular damage, to local dairy farms. In November 2006, heavy rains caused flooding in Nehalem, resulting in $1 million in damage.

Nehalem has been noted multiple times in pop culture. The Portland-based band Everclear has a song, &quot;Nehalem&quot;, about life in the town, on its &quot;Sparkle and Fade&quot; album. In 1995, Nike issued its Nike Air Nehalem Water Sandal and Portland-based Columbia Sportswear named one of its sandal styles after Nehalem. And in 2008, Intel named its 45 nm microarchitecture &quot;Nehalem.&quot; Portland-based Leatherman Tool Group named one of its stainless steel knives the &quot;Nehalem.&quot;

Nehalem was the location for the 2000 HGTV Dream Home Contest, which awarded a furnished home and an automobile.

The Nehalem Bay Dune Site, which is listed in the National Register of Historic Places, is a prehistoric site in the Nehalem vicinity dating to 1310 A.D. The exact location is restricted to protect the site.

On average, there are 10 inches of rainfall each month between November and March. Overall, the area gets about 95 inches of rain, on average, annually. According to a report from Portland State University, higher elevations near Nehalem and the Nehalem Basin can receive 200 inches of rain in a year.

The Port owns one dock on the Nehalem waterfront which is primarily used by its tug and transient boats for channel maintenance and navigation activities. It also deploys markers and navigational buoys throughout the Lower Nehalem River and Nehalem Bay to service vessels during the fishing and boating season.

<text>Pacific City is a census-designated place (CDP) and unincorporated community in Tillamook County, Oregon, United States. The population was 1,109 at the 2020 census. Pacific City is home to the Cape Kiwanda State Natural Area.

==History==
In 1845, Mr. Johnson, a cook on an English ship sailing along the Columbia River, deserted and traveled down the Willamette Valley. Establishing a land claim in Champoeg, he began removing brush and that summer set off a burn to clear debris. The Champoeg Fire got out of control and spread eastward. Unfortunately, the wind then reversed direction and strengthened, blowing the blaze around the previous burn and fanning it into the dry Coast Range, where it burned in the Yamhill basin for weeks, consuming of old growth forest – the largest such area destroyed in a single forest fire in the United States. Settlers did not live west of the Coast Range, but the small tribes of Native Americans in the area, already depleted by 80% due to malaria and other epidemics from 1830 to 1841, were driven from their lands.

The Nestuggas were one such tribe, that had previously been encamped just north of Pacific City near the town of Woods. They had noticed the smoke for several weeks, but were surprised one morning as the bright flames flickered atop the crests of the surrounding hills and rushed down on them. The Nestuggas fled by canoe down the Big Nestucca River to the ocean, and took refuge on the half-mile wide bare sandspit between Nestucca Bay and the ocean. After several weeks the fires were ended by a heavy rain, but the devastation had been complete: the forests were gone, and the game found to be charred crisp or cooked in the water they had sought refuge in.

Nestucca Bay was a rich fishing area, allowing the Nestuggas to survive despite the destruction of game. However, in 1854, settlers began arriving in the Tillamook Valley, and by 1876 Chief Nestugga Bill and the 200 remaining people of the small tribe were relocated to a reservation on the Salmon and Siletz River.

Many early pioneers arrived via seagoing steamers, others arrived from across the mountains. The town of Woods established itself as a depot for the new arrivals and a source of supplies and trade for the settlers. In 1886 the Linewebber and Brown cannery was started to take advantage of the plentiful fish in Nestucca Bay, shipping 12,000 cans of salmon a year and providing an economic basis for the region until 1926, along with logging and dairy farming. The area also became a &quot;vacation&quot; destination for Oregon Trail pioneers from the Midwest, who had never seen the ocean.
In 1893, Thomas Malaney platted the town of Ocean Park (now Pacific City) directly across the river from Woods. When a flood in 1894 wiped out the first lots, Malaney moved the town south to higher ground. The Sea View hotel (later renamed Edmundes Hotel) was built around 1895 to serve vacationers from the Willamette Valley. Other buildings and campgrounds were established for visitors, and Ferry Street was &quot;paved&quot; with wooden planks for automobiles.

The town gained its modern name of Pacific City in 1909 to avoid confusion with the Washington town of Ocean Park. By 1926, overfishing from gillnetting had left the bay depleted of salmon, so commercial harvesting was stopped and fishermen switched to surf-launched dories; over time, due to commercial fishing vessels, the Dory Fleet dwindled and today only a few recreational fishermen keep the tradition alive. In the 1920s, tourism became the mainstay of the economy, lasting until the Great Depression of the 1930s. An airport was built to attract barnstormers and aviators, and other roads and bridges were opened.

<text>The city of Tillamook ( ) serves as the county seat of Tillamook County, Oregon, United States. The city is located on the southeast end of Tillamook Bay on the Pacific Ocean. The population was 5,231 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The city is named for the Tillamook people, a Native American tribe speaking a Salishan language who lived in this area until the early 19th century. Anthropologist Franz Boas identifies the Tillamook Native Americans as the southernmost branch of the Coast Salish peoples of the Pacific Northwest. This group was separated geographically from the northern branch by tribes of Chinookan peoples who occupied territory between them. The name &quot;Tillamook&quot;, he says, is of Chinook origin, and refers to the people of a locality known as &quot;Elim&quot; or &quot;Kelim.&quot; They spoke Tillamook, a combination of two dialects. Tillamook culture differed from that of the northern Coast Salish, Boas says, and might have been influenced by tribal cultures to the south, in what is now Northern California.

Captain Robert Gray first anchored in Tillamook Bay in 1788, marking the first recorded European landing on the Oregon coast. Settlers began arriving in the early 1850s, and Tillamook County was created by the Territorial legislature in 1853. In 1862, the town itself was laid out, and the first post office was opened in 1866. The town was voted to be the county seat in 1873, and Tillamook was officially incorporated as a city in 1891.

During World War II, the United States Navy operated a blimp patrol station near the town at Naval Air Station Tillamook. The station was decommissioned in 1948, and the remaining facility now houses Tillamook Air Museum.

<text>Athena is a city in Umatilla County, Oregon, United States. The population was 1,126 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Hermiston-Pendleton Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Athena, about halfway between Pendleton, Oregon, and Walla Walla, Washington, was originally called Centerville. However, confusion about the name sometimes arose because Oregon had another Centerville, in Washington County, and the state of Washington had a Centerville, in Klickitat County. In 1889, local government officials asked the Centerville school principal, D. W. Jarvis, to recommend a different name. He chose &quot;Athena&quot; after the Greek goddess, and they agreed.

Centerville got its first post office on October 11, 1878. The first postmaster was William T. Cook. The post office name was changed to &quot;Athena&quot; on May 16, 1889.

Nineteenth-century settlers of Scottish descent brought to Athena an interest in the customs and music of Scotland. Before World War I, Athena had a Caledonian Society that held an annual picnic featuring Scottish dancing and bagpipes. Weston-McEwen High School in Athena revived the tradition in the 1950s when it organized a Scots dance group and a pipe band. The band has since performed at many venues in the United States and has traveled to Scotland and England to play.

Athena was also a filming location in the 1930 F.W. Murnau film &quot;City Girl&quot; starring Charles Farrell and Mary Duncan.

The city of Athena was born on Scottish heritage and wants to keep the history and culture alive in the small rural town. Every July the city hosts the Caledonian Games. This event hosts food venues, picnic, and a wide variety of games that are common in Scottish heritage. The event holds &quot;Scottish heritage and athletes competing in events based on historic farm skills.&quot;

In the 1860s, settlers began moving into the area, and built a ferry crossing the Umatilla River at Echo. The city of Echo is named after Echo Koontz, daughter of Cynthia and J. H. Koontz. Agriculture was the first draw, with alfalfa and corn being the main crops. A town was platted by 1880, and the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company built a railroad through Echo by 1883, which made the town a shipping point for wool, cattle and sheep during the early 1900s. Echo was incorporated in 1904.

<text>Hermiston () is a city in Umatilla County, Oregon, United States. Its population of 20,322 makes it the largest city in Eastern Oregon. Hermiston is the largest and fastest-growing city in the Hermiston-Pendleton Micropolitan Statistical Area, the eighth largest Core Based Statistical Area in Oregon with a combined population of 92,261 at the 2020 census. Hermiston sits near the junction of I-82 and I-84, and is 7 miles south of the Columbia River, the Washington state line, Lake Wallula, and the McNary Dam. The Hermiston area has become a hub for logistics and data center activity due to the proximity of the I-82 and I-84 interchange, Pacific Northwest fiber optic backbone, and low power costs.

== History ==

The historic inhabitants of the area were the indigenous Umatilla, Cayuse, Walla Walla, and Columbia Indians, descendants of peoples who lived in this area for thousands of years. The earliest European settlers established a mission near Pendleton in 1847. The territorial government organized Umatilla County in 1862 from the larger Wasco County. 

Hermiston&#x27;s early development was plagued by rivalry between The Maxwell Land &amp; Irrigation Company and developers Skinner &amp; Newport, who both fought to establish their own town of Hermiston in the exact same spot, centrally located in the irrigation district along the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company&#x27;s main line. While Maxwell was able to secure the train depot on the West side of the tracks, Skinner &amp; Newport filed their own Hermiston plat directly across the tracks in November 1904, beating the Maxwell Company&#x27;s filing by two days. With neither side willing to cede to the other, two separate business districts formed on either side of the tracks, Hermiston Avenue on the West side and East Main street on the East side, defiantly placed one block off so they didn&#x27;t align. Each district featured its own bank, hotel and mercantile but East Main street would eventually win out.

On July 10, 1907, the town of Hermiston was incorporated. The original railroad station was named Maxwell, likely after a contemporary official at the railroad company. Colonel J. F. McNaught, an early settler in the region, later named it Hermiston from Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;Weir of Hermiston&quot;.

The greater Hermiston region began to see irrigated agriculture in 1908, with the completion of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation&#x27;s Umatilla Basin Project in the form of Cold Springs Reservoir. The region saw modest growth until the outbreak of World War II, when the Umatilla Army Depot was constructed, causing Hermiston&#x27;s population to jump from 803 at the 1940 US Census to 3,804 in 1950. The region continued to experience modest growth for the next several decades until the 1970s, when low power costs coupled with the development of center-pivot irrigation resulted in a significant expansion in agricultural acreage put in to potato production. The expansion of potato production coincided with the development of large potato processing plants by Lamb-Weston and Simplot, focusing on frozen potato products. The associated economic development drove Hermiston&#x27;s population to nearly double from 4,893 in 1970 to 9,408 by 1980. The 1990s brought additional large employment developments to the Hermiston region in the form of Two Rivers Correctional Institution, a Wal-Mart Distribution Center, expansion of the Union Pacific Hinkle Rail Yard, and beginning of the Umatilla Army Depot&#x27;s Chemical Weapon Incineration process. The 2000s have seen continued growth and diversification of the regional economy as Hermiston has grown to a population of 19,354 at the 2020 Census and has become a regional center for commercial and professional services.

The city is also known for its Watermelons, which are part of its branding.

== Economy ==

=== Retail ===

Hermiston serves as the retail and services center for much of western Umatilla County, as well as Morrow County and parts of Gilliam county. Hermiston&#x27;s Local Trade Area, which describes the area where people will travel to purchase items on a weekly basis, stretches from Pendleton on the East, the Columbia River to the North, Heppner to the South, and Gilliam County to the West. There were 46,000 people living within Hermiston&#x27;s Local Trade Area based on 2010 U.S. Census data. Despite a relatively robust local retail &amp; services market, Hermiston experiences significant retail sales leakage to the Tri-Cities for items purchased on less than a weekly basis. The Tri-Cities, located approximately 30 minutes north of Hermiston in Washington, had a metro-area population of 275,740 as of April 1, 2014, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Washington.

=== Workforce ===
Hermiston has the largest 30-mile-radius workforce in Eastern Oregon. According to 2018 U.S. Census estimates, there were 135,503 people actively employed within a 30-mile radius of Hermiston; in comparison, there are 75,075 in the next-largest regional Labor Shed in Bend. Hermiston-area employers benefit greatly from the proximity of the Tri-Cities in Washington which, based on light traffic, and easy freeway access, is approximately 30–35 minutes to the north of Hermiston. This proximity also allows dual-income households good access to employment opportunities for both wage earners.

===Top employers===
According to the City of Hermiston&#x27;s &quot;2022 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,&quot; the top employers in the area are:

== Parks ==

The City of Hermiston Parks Department maintains 15 parks, 15 landscape areas, and 100-plus acres for the enjoyment of the community. In addition to the developed parks, the department also has 50 additional acres planned for future development. Recent major enhancements include the additions of Riverfront Park, the Oxbow Trail, and continual additions to the Hermiston Family Aquatic Center. Riverfront Park features 16 acres of open grassy areas alongside the Umatilla River, as well as nearly a mile of paved walking paths, with picnic shelters, restrooms, and fishing access. A 1.8-mile paved walking path, named the Oxbow Trail, was added in 2015 to connect Riverfront Park with the north side of town near Good Shepherd Medical Center. The Trail winds through protected wetland area for nearly the entirety of its length and also connects to Harrison Park.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Distance to major cities:
* Tri-Cities, Washington - 
* Portland, Oregon - 
* Seattle, Washington - 
* Spokane, Washington - 
* Boise, Idaho - 
* Salt Lake City, Utah -

Hermiston&#x27;s recent population growth is due to its proximity to large cities in the Pacific Northwest and its location along two major freeways.
===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Hermiston has a steppe climate (Köppen BSk). This gives the area hot dry summers with high daytime temperatures which do cool considerably overnight, and relatively cold winters which typically yield several snow storms per year with relatively minimal accumulation. On June 29, 2021, a max temperature of was recorded in Hermiston, which is just one degree below the new all-time record high temperature for the State of Oregon, which was set at the nearby Pelton Dam, which is also in Jefferson County, on the same day.

The 2019 bond will also add capacity for an additional 200 students at Hermiston High School.
==== High School Sports ====
Hermiston High School competes at the 3A level in the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association. This cross-state membership was approved by the WIAA in 2017 in recognition of the lack of comparable sized large high schools elsewhere in Eastern Oregon. The second largest High School in Eastern Oregon was Pendleton, with only 815 students, compared to Hermiston&#x27;s 1,703. The WIAA membership allows HHS to compete in the Mid-Columbia Conference against high schools from Kennewick, Richland, Pasco, and Walla Walla, Washington and significantly reduce travel times for conference games.

<text>Milton-Freewater is a city in Umatilla County, Oregon, United States. The city received its current name in 1951 when neighboring rival cities of Milton and Freewater voted to merge. The population was 7,151 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Pendleton–Hermiston Micropolitan Statistical Area. Milton-Freewater is home to a growing wine industry.

==History==

First settled in 1868, the community was incorporated as Milton by 1873. It is uncertain how the name was chosen; perhaps in hopes of building a mill, or perhaps in honor of English poet John Milton.

Freewater received its name from the offer of free residential water rights to attract new settlers. Before that name was chosen other proposed names had been New Walla Walla and Wallaette. The town was located to the north of and directly adjacent to Milton.

In 1936, a magnitude 6.1 earthquake centered to the northwest caused significant damage in and around Milton-Freewater. This earthquake was followed by numerous aftershocks and had a temporary effect on the water table.

In the 1960s, Milton-Freewater billed itself as the pea capital of the world. There were several pea canneries in town. It held an annual festival and parade in May, known as the &quot;Pea Festival.&quot; In the late 1970s, agricultural practices and crop prices changed the dynamics of the local economy, and peas were no longer grown as abundantly as they previously had been. One by one the canneries closed down. The town dropped the title and the festival. At the time, Milton-Freewater had a popular August event called the &quot;Corn Roast&quot; and the decision was made to increase the festival to a weekend-long celebration which, in 1981, became known as the Muddy Frogwater Festival (the city had sometimes been referred to as Muddy-Frogwater). The festival is now a three-day event held the third weekend in August each year. Festival activities have included frog-jumping contests, concerts, karaoke competitions, the corn roast, and a dance. The Friends of the Library have held a large outdoor book sale at the festival each year since 1993. On the Sunday morning of the festival there is an outdoor interdenominational church service. The city also has sponsored the creation of more than 50 chainsaw sculpture frogs at local businesses to help market itself as a &quot;fun town&quot; with a quirky nickname.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

==Climate==
Milton-Freewater has a steppe climate (BSk) according to the Köppen climate classification system.

==Demographics==

At the 2010 census, there were 7,050 people, 2,479 households and 1,689 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 2,742 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 70.9% White, 0.6% African American, 0.8% Native American, 0.6% Asian, 24.7% from other races, and 2.5% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 43.1% of the population.

There were 2,479 households, of which 40.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 48.4% were married couples living together, 13.0% had a female householder with no husband present, 6.7% had a male householder with no wife present, and 31.9% were non-families. 27.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 12.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.82 and the average family size was 3.42.

The median age was 31.5 years. 30.4% of residents were under the age of 18; 11% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 24.4% were from 25 to 44; 21.2% were from 45 to 64; and 13.1% were 65 years of age or older. The population was 49.4% male and 50.6% female.

==The Rocks AVA==

<text>Pendleton is a city in and the county seat of Umatilla County, Oregon, United States. The population was 17,107 at the time of the 2020 census, which includes approximately 1,600 people who are incarcerated at Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution.

Pendleton is the smaller of the two principal cities of the Hermiston–Pendleton Micropolitan Statistical Area. This micropolitan area covers Morrow and Umatilla counties and had a combined population of 92,261 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
A European-American commercial center began to develop here in 1851, when William C. McKay established a trading post at the mouth of McKay Creek. A United States Post Office named Marshall (for the owner, and sometime gambler, of another local store) was established April 21, 1865, and later renamed Pendleton, after politician and diplomat George H. Pendleton (1825–1889), who served as a U.S. Representative and Senator from Ohio. The city was incorporated by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on October 25, 1880.

By 1900, Pendleton had a population of 4,406 and was the fourth-largest city in Oregon. The Pendleton Woolen Mills and Pendleton Round Up became features of the city captured in early paintings by Walter S. Bowman. Like many cities in Eastern Oregon, where thousands of Chinese immigrant workers built the transcontinental railroad, it had a flourishing Chinatown that developed as the workers settled here. The sector is supposed to have been underlain by a network of tunnels, which are now a tourist attraction. The authenticity as a Chinese tunnel system has been questioned.

The town is the cultural center of Eastern Oregon. Pendleton&#x27;s &quot;Old town&quot; is listed as a Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) have their property nearby. They have established the Wildhorse Resort &amp; Casino and golf course on the reservation to generate revenue for development and welfare. They have also built the Tamástslikt Cultural Institute, for education and interpretation of their cultures.

==Economy==
Pendleton Woolen Mills is a maker of wool blankets, shirts, and an assortment of other woolen goods. Founded in 1909 by Clarence, Roy and Chauncey Bishop, the company built upon earlier businesses related to the many sheep ranches in the region. A wool-scouring plant opened in Pendleton in 1893 to wash raw wool for shipping. In 1895, the scouring mill was converted into a mill that made wool blankets and robes for Native Americans. Both businesses failed to survive, but the Bishops, with the help of a local bond issue, enlarged the mill and improved its efficiency. They developed a successful line of garments and blankets with &quot;vivid colors and intricate patterns.&quot;

St. Anthony Hospital in Pendleton is a 25-bed medical center.

Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution (EOCI) in Pendleton is the only place in Oregon where inmates make &quot;Prison Blues&quot; denim clothing. The prison also operates a commercial laundry serving customers that include EOCI, the Snake River Correctional Institution, Pendleton High School, a local flour mill, and other entities. In addition, some EOCI inmates work as clerks or have jobs in food service or maintenance.

It reached Umatilla and Wallula in 1881, Pendleton in 1882, and then La Grande, Baker City, and Huntington, where by 1884 it met the UP line from Utah. Since Pendleton was also connected by rail to the Northern Pacific line at Wallula and Walla Walla, by 1885 it was a stop on two transcontinental lines. The UP absorbed the OR&amp;N line in 1889.

==Sister cities==
Pendleton has a sister city relationship with Marikina, a municipality-turned-city in the Philippines. The relationship was established in 1971 when then mayor Eddie O. Knopp and Marikina mayor Osmundo de Guzman had their daughters temporarily switch schools in their respective towns. By 1974, Knopp visited Marikina after Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos declared a nationwide martial law two years prior, and expressed that based on the &quot;excellent peace and order situation&quot; he saw while in the country, the United States could try implementing martial law in towns rampant with violence and crime.

Another sister city of Pendleton is the town of Minamisōma, in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. Minamisoma is north of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, which was damaged by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Since then, Japanese exchange students from Minamisoma have continued to visit Pendleton, though students from Pendleton have stopped visiting Minamisoma over growing radiation concerns.

<text>Ukiah (/juːkaɪʌ/) is a city in Umatilla County, Oregon, United States. The population was 186 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Hermiston-Pendleton Micropolitan Statistical Area. It was named by an early settler after the town of Ukiah, California.

Ukiah is tied with Seneca, in Grant County, for the coldest official temperature in Oregon. Ukiah dropped to on February 9, 1933, during a major cold snap across Siberia and North America. On February 10, Seneca also hit −54 °F, so the National Weather Service gives Seneca the record because it had the most recent occurrence of that temperature.

<text>Umatilla (, ) is a city in Umatilla County, Oregon, United States. The population in 2010 was 6,906, but the city&#x27;s population includes approximately 2,000 inmates incarcerated at Two Rivers Correctional Institution.

Umatilla is part of the Hermiston-Pendleton Micropolitan Statistical Area, but has the highest poverty rate (24%) and lowest Median Household Income ($38,796) of all communities in the area, trailing neighboring Hermiston in household income by nearly 23%.

The city is on the south side of the Columbia River along U.S. Route 730 and I-82. The Umatilla Chemical Depot, is southwest of the city, northwest of the intersection of I-84 and I-82.

== History ==
Before European settlement, the peninsula formed by the convergence of the Umatilla and Columbia rivers had been occupied by the indigenous Umatilla people for at least 10,000 years, being the site of temporary and seasonal villages, fishing and later horse breeding. On their return trip from the mouth of the Columbia River in 1806, the Lewis and Clark Expedition made note in their journals of a village on the site.

The first Umatilla post office was established in September 1851 at the Umatilla Indian Agency about east of Pendleton, but was discontinued in January 1852. The Umatilla Indian Reservation was created in 1855 after the Walla Walla Council treaty and many of the Umatilla, Cayuse and Walla Walla tribes relocated there, with the vast majority of their lands being given over to the US government. Not long after, when gold was discovered in the Boise Basin of Idaho and in Montana in 1862, the Columbia River became an important passageway inland to the gold fields. That same year Timothy K. Davenport surveyed for a townsite at the mouth of the Umatilla River and filed a plat in 1863. The site was chosen for its location just below the Umatilla Rapids, which formed a navigational headwater on the Columbia and prevented boats from traveling further upstream without needing to be portaged or needing their cargo transferred to a new boat above the rapids. The site was first known as Umatilla Landing, then Umatilla City, then Columbia, reverting to Umatilla City once again over the next year or so. Its post office was established in 1863 with Z. F. Moody as postmaster.

Umatilla quickly became an important trade and distribution center not just for gold rush travelers but for the growing population of farmers and ranchers in the surrounding region. A business district developed along Water Street at the river&#x27;s edge and at the town&#x27;s peak it had 3 hotels, 22 saloons, 6 mercantiles and 3 grocery stores, among others. It won the county seat of Umatilla County by a small margin on March 6, 1865, but would only remain so until 1868 when it was moved to the burgeoning village of Pendleton. That same year the first newspaper (a tri-weekly) was established. For a brief time during the gold rush in the 1860s, there was competition between Umatilla and Wallula, Washington, to become the &quot;Sacramento of the Upper Columbia&quot; but the gold rush wouldn&#x27;t last long enough to support either town&#x27;s growth beyond frontier villages.

Umatilla remained a vital commercial center until the late 1870s, when the removal of the rapids in 1877 allowed boats traveling from The Dalles to continue directly to Wallula and beyond. The following year the Oregon Steam Navigation Company began construction of a narrow gauge railroad that would connect Umatilla to the agricultural inland, passing from Pendleton to Weston. The great flood of 1894 destroyed what was left of the original business district and many surviving buildings were moved away from the river. The Umatilla Masonic Lodge Hall, one of the only surviving buildings from the original townsite, was relocated to Echo, Oregon, to the southeast, in 1901. By the early 1910s, Umatilla was making a resurgence as an agricultural center and a new business district was forming along 3rd and 4th streets, facing away from the river and towards the railroad tracks. Once again the town had several hotels and even a bank. In 1916 several women launched secret bids for local office, resulting in what has been called the Petticoat Revolution.

The Umatilla Chemical Depot opened in 1941, to prepare for World War II. The depot&#x27;s mission was to store and maintain a variety of military items, from blankets to ammunition. The depot took on its chemical weapons storage mission in 1962. From 1990 to 1994 the facility reorganized in preparation for eventual closure, shipping all conventional ammunition and supplies to other installations. On October 25, 2011, the last barrel of HD mustard agent was destroyed and there is no longer a risk of chemical accident in Oregon and Washington.

The original townsite of Umatilla was abandoned completely when the United States Corps of Engineers determined that it would likely be inundated by the construction of the John Day Dam. Between 1965 and 1968 the town was completely rebuilt south of the railroad tracks and all of the buildings on the original townsite were bought and demolished. The relocation would turn out to be for naught as the water level at this point in the river was not affected by the dam&#x27;s reservoir. Umatilla&#x27;s original street grid can still be seen north of the railroad tracks and is now a nature preserve and protected archaeological site. It is still owned by the Corps of Engineers and is not accessible to the public.

<text>Weston is a city in Umatilla County, Oregon, United States. It was originally a post office called Mitchell&#x27;s Station, established in February 1867. In September 1869, T.T. Lieuallen renamed the post office after his hometown, Weston, Missouri. The population was 667 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Pendleton–Hermiston Micropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
Weston was incorporated by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on October 19, 1878.

Weston is best known for its connection with novelist Nard Jones (1904–1972), who lived in the city with his parents between 1919 and 1927, and whose first novel &quot;Oregon Detour&quot; was set in an Oregon town of 600 inhabitants called &quot;Creston&quot;. When his novel, written according to the tenets of the New Realism literary movement (established years before by Sherwood Anderson, Sinclair Lewis and others) was published in 1930, many of the residents were convinced that his characters were based on local inhabitants, and considered the work a slander against the town. While the legend that Jones was sued and ran out of town for his book is not true, members of the town made an effort to locally suppress access to the book: copies of the novel were stolen from the local library; after the novel became the subject for a high school student&#x27;s book report, his English teacher removed the book from both the reading list and the high school library. According to George Venn, local literary historian, even in the 1980s, &quot;trying to figure out or trying to remember who the &#x27;real people&#x27; in the novel is still a local pastime.&quot;

<doc id="130974" wikidata="Q3050890" url="?curid=130974" title="Elgin, Oregon">
<text>Elgin is a city in Union County, Oregon, United States. The population was 1,711 at the 2010 census. The community is named after the &quot;Lady Elgin&quot;, a ship lost on Lake Michigan.

The city is known for the Elgin Opera House, originally dedicated in 1912.

== History ==
Elgin was settled by hunters, trappers, and people of all ethnic groups. Very rarely did they make the treacherous travels from nearby La Grande, because it was 120 miles away by river through the valley, which back then was covered in thick forest. (Today, La Grande and Elgin are only 20 miles away via Wallowa Lake Highway). Elgin was the gathering place for trappers and hunters to replenish their supplies. This is how Elgin became the &quot;Elgin Huskies&quot;. Many settlers emigrated from Walla Walla across the mountains on dog sleds. Mr. Mckinnis and his family were the first settlers. He brought cattle from Illinois and moved to what was the outskirts of Elgin, and built one of the first homes. Even though his home is not set in the history in Elgin there is a letter from his wife&#x27;s sister attesting to this fact. Mr. McKinnis built the mills from Elgin to La Grande and also owned all the century farms in the valley passing them down to his kin in death. He also worked in the first bank in Elgin before they moved to La Grande. Mr. McKinnis stated that this home was built in 1864. 

The area of Elgin was previously called &quot;Fish Trap&quot; and &quot;Indian Valley.&quot; The city was platted in 1886 following the washout of Ruckles Road over the Blue Mountains, which caused investors to leave nearby Summerville for Elgin.

By 1887 Elgin had general stores, a livery, a hotel, and a church, as well as a nearby sawmill, which continues as a more modern Boise Cascade mill. Between 1887 and 1908, the area around Elgin had 35 sawmills, most transportable water-driven whipsaws (vertical reciprocating saws). Local landowners would sell the trees for 50 cents per thousand board feet, which is about how much the sawmills could handle in a day. At the time, log transportation cost about two dollars per thousand board feet, and a mill could sell the processed lumber for $6–10 per thousand board feet.

Growth increased with the arrival of the Oregon Railway &amp; Navigation Company railroad branch line from La Grande, Oregon in Nov. 1890. The railroad was expanded from Elgin to Wallowa, Oregon and Joseph, Oregon in 1908 by the Union Pacific Railroad. Elgin was incorporated by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on February 18, 1891.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Elgin is at the junction of Oregon Route 82 and Oregon Route 204. Jubilee Lake and its campground are north of Elgin, in the Umatilla National Forest.

==Climate==

<doc id="130977" wikidata="Q1645049" url="?curid=130977" title="La Grande, Oregon">
<text>La Grande () is a city in Union County, Oregon, United States. La Grande is Union County&#x27;s largest city, with a population of 13,082 at the time of the 2010 U.S. Census. The La Grande metro population is 25,076. It is the 16th largest metropolitan area in Oregon.

La Grande is located within the Grande Ronde Valley and is the only true valley in Oregon as it is surrounded by mountains. The Blue Mountains, Elkhorn Mountains, Eagle Cap Wilderness and Grande Ronde River offer abundance of natural resources and wildlife. Economically, it started as a logging and agriculture town but is now identified as a gateway for many outdoor sports.

It is the hub for surrounding communities offering outdoor recreation, shopping centers and entertainment. La Grande is known for its theater and arts as the downtown area boasts Liberty Theater and the Elgin Opera House often has local showings. La Grande also is a college town with a student population of 2,825 at Eastern Oregon University.

==History==
Originally named &quot;Brownsville,&quot; it was forced to change its name because that name was being used for a city in Linn County. Located in the Grande Ronde Valley, the city&#x27;s name comes from an early French settler, Charles Dause, who often used the phrase &quot;La Grande&quot; to describe the area&#x27;s beauty. The population was 13,082 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Union County. La Grande lies east of the Blue Mountains and southeast of Pendleton.

===Early settlement===
The Grande Ronde Valley had long been a waypoint along the Oregon Trail. The first permanent settler in the La Grande area was Benjamin Brown in 1861. Not long after, the Leasey family and about twenty others settled there. The settlement was originally named after Ben Brown as Brown&#x27;s Fort, Brown&#x27;s Town, or Brownsville. There was already a Brownsville in Linn County, so when the post office was established in 1863, a more distinctive name was needed. It was decided to use &quot;La Grande&quot;, a phrase used by a Frenchman, Charles Dause, to describe the area&#x27;s scenic splendor. Before the post office was established, William Currey charged 50 cents a letter to carry the mail on horseback to and from the nearest post office, in Walla Walla, Washington. La Grande was incorporated as a city in 1865, and platted in 1868.

===Growth===
La Grande grew rapidly during the late 1860s and early 1870s, partially because of the region&#x27;s many gold mines and the valley&#x27;s agricultural capabilities. The early business establishments centered on C Avenue between present day Fourth Street and the hillside on the west end.

In 1884, the railroad came to the flat slightly east of &quot;Old Town&quot;. This helped the town to grow and gave rise to &quot;New Town&quot;, centered on Adams Avenue and built parallel to the railroad tracks.

By 1900, La Grande&#x27;s population was 2992, representing half of the population of Baker City.

La Grande&#x27;s Eastern Oregon University, formerly known as Eastern Oregon State College, began in 1929 as Eastern Oregon Normal School, a teachers college.

===Sugar factory===
La Grande had a factory for processing sugar beets into raw sugar. The sugar beets came from the nearby Mormon town of Nibley, Oregon, and both were owned by the Oregon Sugar Company. R. Doerstling, the superintendent of the factory in 1899, reported seeing a Native American teepee built out of used cloth filters from the factory.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The town is a major hub in the valley. Mount Emily is a Grande Ronde Valley landmark towering over the city of La Grande to the north. It often features prominently on logos of local organizations and is matched on the other side of the valley by a similar landmark, Mount Harris.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification system, La Grande features a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;), closely bordering on a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;). This climate type is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold winters.

:&quot;See also Wikimedia Commons Photographs from the La Grande Commercial Historic District&quot;

La Grande includes a historic commercial district listed on the National Register of Historic Places in September 2001. The district is bounded by the following:
*on the northeast, by Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company/Union Pacific Railroad tracks along Jefferson Avenue;
*on the south, by Spring Avenue, Greenwood Street and Cove Avenue;
*on the southwest by Washington Avenue; and
*on the west by Fourth Street.
==Education==
The city is served by the La Grande School District, which includes Central Elementary School, Island City Elementary, Greenwood Elementary School, La Grande Middle School, and La Grande High School. La Grande is the home of Eastern Oregon University.

==Media==
&quot;The Observer&quot; is the local daily newspaper. Local radio stations include
KLBM AM 1450 and the following stations on the FM dial:
KUBQ FM 98.7,
KWRL FM 102.3,
KTVR FM 90.3
KCMB FM 104.7, and
KRJT FM 105.9.

La Grande is considered part of the Portland television market despite its distance from the western part of the state. Independent television station KUNP (channel 16) is licensed to La Grande as a sister station to Portland ABC affiliate KATU (channel 2), though is effectively considered to be a Portland station because its former owner employed a strategy of using fringe stations to serve an entire market through cable and satellite distribution with little to no local presence (KUNP&#x27;s parent company maintains a translator station serving Portland proper).

<text>Union is a city in Union County, Oregon, United States, originally platted in 1864, and located southeast of La Grande. It is the namesake of Union County, which references the Union states, or Northern States, of the American Civil War. The population was 2,152 at the 2020 census. The city is known for the numerous historic Victorian homes that line its Main Street, some of which are registered on the National Register of Historic Places. It is also home to Oregon State University&#x27;s Eastern Oregon Agricultural Research Center, founded in 1888, which is contemporarily housed in the former Union train station.

== History ==
Union was platted on November 11, 1864 along the Oregon Trail. The name references the Union states, or Northern States, of the American Civil War.

La Grande was named the county seat when Union County was created in 1865. Due to the Thomas and Ruckle Road going through Union, it elected the county seat in 1872, but when the railroad was built it was put through La Grande instead of Union. La Grande became the bigger town within the county and regained the county seat in 1902. J. W. Shelton, a local attorney, chartered the Union Electric Power and Light Company in March 1890 to bring the railroad from Union Junction (2.5 miles away) to Union itself. The company was renamed the Union Railway Company in July 1890, and the rail spur was built into Union by August 1892. Shelton planned to build more lines, had a fight with his company partners (the Hutchinsons), then two competing firms were formed: Shelton&#x27;s The Union Railway in January 1893, and Hutchinsons&#x27; Union Street Railway and Suburban Railway. Both companies competed to buy the Union Railway Company. Shelton maintained control until August 1905, when The Union Railway was renamed to the Union, Cove and Valley Railway. This company was bought the following year by a timber company from the East Coast.

During the 2006 November elections, Kyle Corbin, an 18-year-old college student, was elected mayor after a successful write-in campaign. He had promised to bring an end to the political chaos that had plagued the town for the last two years, which included three councilmen and mayor Deborah Clark being removed in recall elections. &quot;I know the procedures and rules,&quot; he told an &quot;Oregonian&quot; reporter. &quot;I&#x27;ve run a meeting with a bunch of high school kids.&quot; Since then, one newspaper reports that &quot;talk around town about whether the young mayor will succeed ranges from skepticism to sunny optimism.&quot;

==Geography==

Oregon Route 237 runs through the city between Cove to the north and North Powder to the south. Oregon Route 203 also passes through Union, linking it to La Grande, about to the northwest. Catherine Creek, a tributary of the Grande Ronde River, passes through the city.

<text>Joseph is a city in Wallowa County, Oregon, United States. Originally named Silver Lake and Lake City, the city formally named itself in 1880 for Chief Joseph (1840–1904) of the Nez Perce people. The population was 1,081 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
Joseph was platted in 1883, and the economy was originally based on the land, especially grain and stock. In 1896 the First Bank of Joseph was robbed; one robber was shot and killed, another shot and captured, and a third escaped with the money. On occasion there have been reenactments of the robbery. After a railroad line was completed to Joseph in 1908, a lumber mill opened, bolstering the economy.

When the timber industry collapsed in the 1980s, local unemployment rate approached 17%. However, in 1982 a new industry was born as three bronze foundries opened in the local area.

The city sponsors the annual Chief Joseph Days Rodeo in late July, Bronze, Blues and Brews in August since 2001, and Alpenfest in September, a Swiss-Bavarian festival staged in Joseph and at nearby Wallowa Lake. Alpenfest resembles an Oktoberfest but has more yodeling and alphorn playing, reflecting the area&#x27;s reputation as &quot;Oregon&#x27;s Little Switzerland.&quot;

<text>Wallowa () is a city in Wallowa County, Oregon, United States. The population was 808 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
The Wallowa Valley is within the traditional lands of the Nez Perce. In the late 19th century, the Wallowa band was one of more than a dozen groups who lived across the inland Northwest as members of the Nez Perce tribe. The U.S. government sent the army to force them out after they refused to sign a treaty that would have removed them from their land. Chief Joseph led tribal members more than 1,000 miles to western Montana. They repeatedly battled with the army as they fled.

Wallowa was platted in 1889. &quot;Wallowa&quot; is a Nez Perce word describing a triangular structure of stakes that in turn supported a network of sticks called &quot;lacallas&quot; to form a fish trap. The Nez Perce put these traps in the Wallowa River below the outlet of Wallowa Lake. The author of &quot;Oregon Geographic Names&quot;, Lewis A. McArthur, said that although the origin of this name is disputed, he puts great weight in Levi Ankeny who supplied this information as he was &quot;thoroughly familiar with the early history and tradition of the Wallowa Valley&quot; and &quot;on intimate terms with many Indians who knew the facts of the matter&quot;.

<text>Antelope (known as Rajneesh from 1984 to 1986) is a city in rural Wasco County, Oregon, United States. Antelope had an estimated population of 47 people in 2012.

The city was established in 1872 at a stage and freight wagon road stop on the old Dalles to Canyon City Trail. It was incorporated as the City of Antelope in 1901.

In the early 1980s, hundreds of members of the Rajneesh movement moved in and built a small city in previously unoccupied land they purchased. The Rajneeshees effectively took over the government of the city by outnumbering the original residents with new voter registrations. On September 18, 1984, a vote was held, and the city was renamed Rajneesh, Oregon. By 1985, after several of the Rajneesh movement leaders were discovered to have been involved in criminal behavior (including a mass food poisoning attack and an aborted plot to assassinate a U.S. Attorney), leader Rajneesh left the country as part of a plea deal for federal immigration fraud charges, and the Rajneesh commune collapsed. On November 6, 1985, the city voted to revert to the name Antelope.

==History==
The Antelope Valley was probably named by European-American members of Joseph Sherar&#x27;s party, who were packing supplies to mines in the John Day area. Sherar became known as the operator of a toll bridge across the Deschutes River, on a cut-off of the Barlow Road. In the early 19th century, the area supported many pronghorns, which are not true antelopes, but are often called &quot;pronghorn antelopes&quot;.

===19th century beginnings===
In the mid-19th century, Antelope began as a station along the wagon road connecting The Dalles on the Columbia River with gold mines near Canyon City. After about 1870, the wagon road became known as The Dalles Military Road. The road crossed the Deschutes River on Sherar&#x27;s Bridge.
The Antelope post office was established in 1871, with Howard Maupin, founder of Maupin, Oregon, as the first postmaster. The town&#x27;s population peaked around 1900, shortly after the Columbia Southern Railway completed a rail line from Biggs, on the Columbia River, to Shaniko, a few miles north of Antelope. The railroad timetable for September 9, 1900, lists a daily stagecoach run from the train terminal in Shaniko to Antelope and beyond. Antelope was incorporated by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on January 29, 1901.

===Rajneesh movement ===

Rajneeshpuram, a farming and meditation commune founded by the Rajneesh movement, followers of Bhagwan Shri Rajneesh, was established near the town in 1981. The town attempted to disincorporate in April 1982 to avoid a takeover by the Rajneesh followers, who registered to vote in Antelope en masse and rejected the measure. The Rajneeshees gained a majority on the town council following the November 1982 elections and resignation of two other members. On September 18, 1984, the city was renamed &quot;Rajneesh&quot;.

The organization collapsed in 1985 following the discovery by the authorities of criminal activities, such as a bioterror attack a year prior that exposed non-Rajneeshees in Wasco County to salmonella to prevent them from voting. On November 6, 1985, the remaining residents, which included both original residents and some remaining Rajneeshees, voted 34 to 0 to restore the original name, and it was subsequently restored in 1986. The U.S. Postal Service had never recognized the change of name.

Subsequent to the collapse of the commune, the property reverted to ownership by the State of Oregon for non-payment of taxes, and was sold to Montana billionaire Dennis Washington in 1991 for $3.65 million. Currently, the ranch, from Antelope, is operated by Young Life, a Christian parachurch organization, as a Christian youth camp known as &quot;Washington Family Ranch&quot;.

The events of the mid-1980s that involved the Rajneesh group were the subject of the 2003 &quot;Forensic Files&quot; TV series episode &quot;Bio Attack&quot;, and the 2018 Netflix documentary &quot;Wild Wild Country&quot;.

==Geography==

Antelope, in Wasco County in north-central Oregon, is along Oregon Route 218 just north of its intersection with Oregon Route 293. By highway, the city is northeast of Madras and east of Portland. Antelope Creek, in the Deschutes River watershed, flows by Antelope.

<text>The Dalles () ; formally the City of The Dalles and also called Dalles City, is an inland port and the largest city in Wasco County, Oregon, United States. The population was 16,010 at the 2020 census, and it is the largest city in Oregon along the Columbia River outside the Portland Metropolitan Area. The Dalles is 75 miles (121 km) east of Portland, within the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area.

==History==
The area around The Dalles is known to have been a trading center for Native Americans as long as 10,000 years ago and is thus one of the oldest inhabited places in North America.

The site of what is now the city of The Dalles was a major Native American trading center. The general area is one of the continent&#x27;s most significant archaeological regions. Lewis and Clark camped near Mill Creek on October 25–27, 1805, and recorded the Indian name for the creek as &quot;Quenett&quot;.

===Etymology===
The name of the city comes from the French word &quot;&quot;, meaning either &quot;sluice&quot;, akin to English &quot;dale&quot; and German &quot;T&quot;[&quot;h&quot;]&quot;al&quot;, &quot;valley&quot;, or &quot;flagstone&quot;, referring to the columnar basalt rocks carved by the river (in &quot;voyageur&quot; French used to refer to rapids), which was used by the French-Canadian employees of the North West Company to refer to the rapids of the Columbia River between the present-day city and Celilo Falls. Also in the same area was the Petites Dalles or Little Dalles, or Short Narrows. In French, &quot;les dalles&quot; means &quot;the slabs&quot;. When a river flows over hard flat rocks, it becomes shallow, and rapids are created.

===Fur trade===
The first use of the name &quot;Dalles&quot;, according to &quot;Oregon Geographic Names,&quot; appears in fur trader Gabriel Franchère&#x27;s &quot;Narrative&quot;, on April 12, 1814, referring to the long series of major rapids in the river. Starting in the 1810s, Americans and Europeans passed by what became The Dalles, active in the North American fur trade as employees of either the American Pacific Fur Company (PFC) or the Canadian North West Company (NWC). Men like NWC officer David Thompson voyaged both down and up the Columbia, traveling through Celilo Falls. The War of 1812 led to the 1813 liquidation of the PFC, its properties like Fort Astoria sold to the North West Company.

In 1821 the North West Company was absorbed by the giant London-based Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC). Fort Vancouver, built in 1824, replaced Fort Astoria as the regional fur trade headquarters. The HBC&#x27;s trading network made extensive use of the Columbia River. The rapids of the Columbia River at The Dalles was the largest and longest of the four &quot;great portages&quot;, where fur trading boats had to unload and transship their cargoes. Sometimes, during high water, boats traveling downriver would &quot;shoot the rapids&quot; instead of portaging, although the practice was dangerous and many people died as a result over the years.

===Wascopam Mission===
In 1838 a branch of Jason Lee&#x27;s Methodist Mission was established at Celilo Falls, named the Wascopam Mission, after the native Wasco Indians. In 1850 the U.S. Army founded a small post at the site of the old mission, being eventually named Fort Dalles. Fort Dalles became the nucleus of the town of The Dalles, which began to develop along the waterfront. In 1855, at the end of the Cayuse War, the Indians living near The Dalles were forcibly relocated by the U.S. Army to the Warm Springs Indian Reservation.

===American settlement===
In the early 1840s American settlers began to arrive in significant numbers, traveling overland via the Oregon Trail. The trail ended at The Dalles. It was not possible to take wagons farther west due to steep cliffs that fell straight into the Columbia River. Until the construction of the Barlow Road in 1846, the only way to reach Fort Vancouver and the Willamette Valley was by rafting down the river from The Dalles.

A post office was established within the boundaries of the current city in 1851, and The Dalles was incorporated as a city in 1857. It has been the major commercial center between Portland and Pendleton since. The city was originally named just &quot;Dalles&quot;. In 1853 it was changed to &quot;Wascopum,&quot; then, in 1860, to &quot;The Dalles&quot;.

In 1864, the U.S. Congress appropriated money to build a U.S. mint in The Dalles that was to use gold from Canyon City for coinage. The supply of gold from Canyon City began to dwindle, however, and other problems, such as cost overruns, workers leaving to work the gold fields, and flooding from the Columbia River, also contributed to the project running two years behind schedule and led eventually to its demise. In 1870, the State of Oregon received the property from the U.S. Government and the building was put to other uses. The mint is now home to Freebridge Brewing.
===20th and 21st centuries===

Construction of The Dalles Dam in 1957 submerged the Long Narrows and Celilo Falls.

In 1963, Ken Kesey&#x27;s novel &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; was published featuring the narrator, Chief, who is from The Dalles.

In 1970, the Bonneville Power Administration opened the Celilo Converter Station near the northern terminus of the Pacific DC Intertie which sends 3,100 megawatts of electricity to Los Angeles.

In 1982, a curly-coated kitten was born on a farm in The Dalles owned by Linda and Dick Koehl. The Koehls used this kitten and her offspring to develop a new breed of cat called the LaPerm, which went on to become a popular, established, championship pedigree cat breed around the world.

In 1984, The Dalles was the site of the first and single largest bioterrorism attack in United States history.

In 1986, &quot;Penalty Phase&quot;, a film starring Peter Strauss and Melissa Gilbert, was filmed in and around The Dalles.

In 2018, Terry A. Davis, creator of the TempleOS operating system, walked from Portland, Oregon to The Dalles in three days via the Columbia River Gorge. There, he was struck by a train and died at the age of 48.

==Geography==

Highways I-84, US 30, and US 197 meet in the city.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===

The Dalles is usually classified as a semiarid (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) climate region. However, it has some characteristics of the midlatitude oceanic climate that dominates west of the Cascade Mountains, combined with seasonal precipitation patterns very similar to those found in Mediterranean climates. The city&#x27;s location in the eastern Columbia Gorge results in the presence of numerous microclimates within a few miles of town. To the immediate west, the winters are significantly wetter, and summers are significantly cooler. In contrast, upland locations to the south are significantly cooler in all seasons. The generally warm and dry summers near town make it the ideal climate for the numerous Bing cherry orchards in the area.

The summer season runs from mid-June through early September and is quite warm by Pacific Northwest standards; however, summer weather often oscillates between intense heat waves and much cooler and windier periods. Except for the occasional sporadic thunderstorm, there is almost no summer rainfall.

From late September through early November, the area experiences an abrupt autumn during which normal temperatures drop very rapidly and cloudy, wet weather quickly picks up. Prior to the sudden onset of the rainy season in mid- to late fall, there are often days with a very wide disparity between daytime and nighttime temperatures, sometimes exceeding . There is far less wind in the fall than in spring and early summer, though passing frontal systems can still bring quick bouts of strong wind.

Winter is the wet season in The Dalles. Despite the rain shadow effect created by the Cascades, there is still enough precipitation most years to support relatively high soil moisture levels for most of the winter. This is a very similar pattern to what happens in classic Mediterranean climates – except that the temperatures are significantly colder. The area receives measurable snowfall virtually every year, but the snow totals fluctuate dramatically from one year to the next; some seasons see only one or two brief light snow events while others get major snowstorms and cumulative totals of or more. The most snowfall in a season has been between July 1949 and June 1950. Average winter temperatures are only about colder than in cities such as Portland and Seattle, and temperatures below are very rare, but not unheard of – historically occurring on three mornings out of every five winters, but only once since February 1996.

As in the summer, winter temperatures can vary tremendously from one day to the next. During arctic air events the daytime high temperatures will generally be well below , while a strong subtropical push can raise temperatures into the 50s and low 60s F, even in January. It is quite common for relatively cold air to become trapped at low elevations due to an inversion above; depending on the temperature of the surface airmass, depth of the inversion layer, and temperatures above the inversion layer, this can result in snow, sleet, freezing rain or a very cold liquid rain.

Springtime conditions generally run from late February through early June, during which time the overall trend gradually becomes warmer and drier and the landscape briefly turns lush and green. This is the windiest season of all, with a powerful west wind on most afternoons. During stormy periods in spring, conditions are usually cloudy and cool, while most sunny and calm days become intensely warm, especially from April onward. Springtime temperatures often vary more from one week to the next than they do from one month to the next.

The growing season is roughly 200 days long in a typical year, generally running from early April through most of October. However, the spring frost dates can range from mid-March to early May, and the fall frost dates can range from late September to mid-November.

A weather station is located at nearby Columbia Gorge Regional Airport, also known as The Dalles Municipal Airport.

==Economy==
In 2006, Google began building a major data center, known locally as Project 02, along the Columbia River in The Dalles, using the area&#x27;s reliable hydroelectric power and the underutilized fiber optic capacity of the area. The new complex includes two buildings, each approximately the size of a football field, and two cooling plants, each four stories high. The project promised hundreds of jobs in the area, mainly in construction, with an additional 200 permanent positions expected later in 2006 although as of 2013 Google employed only 150 combined company employees and contractors in The Dalles.

===Top employers===

In 2021, Wasco County published a list of top employers in the region. Mid-Columbia Medical Center was the number one employer listed with over 500 employees; a local school district, Oregon Cherry Growers and Fred Meyer all reported more than 250 employers. Google employed between 100 and 250 people, according to the list.
In 2012, the top 15 employers in The Dalles according to the Mid-Columbia Economic Development District report on &quot;Largest Employers in Wasco County&quot; were:

==Education==

The Dalles is home to Oregon School District 21. Originally 2 school districts; District 9 in the Chenoweth area and District 12 which included much of The Dalles.

District 21 includes 3 elementary schools: Colonel Wright Elementary, Chenoweth Elementary and Dry Hollow Elementary. District 21 is also home to Innovations Academy, The Dalles Middle School and The Dalles High School.
