<text>Collierville ( &quot;call your ville&quot; or &quot;call yer ville&quot;) is a town in Shelby County, Tennessee, United States, and a suburb located in the Memphis metropolitan area. With a population of 51,324 in the 2020 census, Collierville is the third largest municipality in the county after Memphis and Bartlett. It is home to the Carriage Crossing shopping mall and is served by Collierville Schools.

Founded by entrepreneur Jesse R. Collier in 1836, Collierville was the site of the First and Second Battles of Collierville during the American Civil War, during which the town suffered severe damage. After a period of regrowth, Collierville saw substantial economic expansion in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and now boasts a high quality of life. Collierville&#x27;s downtown area is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and in 2014 Collierville&#x27;s historic town square was ranked by &quot;Parade&quot; as the &quot;Best Main Street&quot; in America.

==History==
Collierville is the second oldest town in Shelby County. The original town of Collierville was laid out in 1836 and named after entrepreneur Jesse R. Collier, who bought land and advertised it as &quot;The Town of Collier&quot;; the town was incorporated in 1850 under the mayorship of Richard Ramsey.

During the American Civil War, two battles were fought at Collierville in late 1863. During the First Battle of Collierville on October 11, 1863, Confederate Brigadier General James Chalmers&#x27;s division of 3,000 men attacked the garrison established at Collierville to protect the Memphis and Charleston Railroad; the garrison was defended by Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman and the Confederates were repulsed. During the Second Battle of Collierville on November 3, Chalmers was again repulsed, this time by Colonel Edward Hatch; Chalmers then withdrew to Mississippi. The railroad remained open to Tuscumbia, Alabama for United States troop movements. The estimated casualties were sixty on the side of the Union and ninety-five on the side of the Confederacy. Because of William T. Sherman&#x27;s participation in the first engagement, his monument in Washington, D.C. lists &quot;Colliersville&quot; as one of his battles. Union commanders referred to it as &quot;Colliersville&quot; in the official reports.
The town sustained severe damage during the First Battle of Collierville and most of the town was completely burned down. Collierville was re-incorporated in 1870 under the mayorship of James B. Abington and during the twentieth century grew with help from the cotton, dairy, and manufacturing industries.

<doc id="135364" wikidata="Q588898" url="?curid=135364" title="Germantown, Tennessee">
<text>Germantown is a city in Shelby County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 41,333 at the 2020 census. It was given a Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award for Performance Excellence in 2019.

Germantown is a suburb of Memphis, bordering it to the east-southeast. Germantown was founded in 1841 by mostly German emigrants. The town hosts festivals year round to celebrate their history and German culture. In the city center is the &quot;Old Germantown&quot; neighborhood, anchored by a railroad depot (a 1948 reproduction of the 1868 original) and railroad tracks that recall the community&#x27;s earliest days of development as an outpost along the Memphis and Charleston Railroad.

The city hosts many horse shows and competitions annually, most notably the Germantown Charity Horse Show in June. Other major annual events include the Germantown Festival, an arts and crafts fair, in early September.

Germantown has the lowest crime rate for any city its size in the State of Tennessee and the police and fire departments have average emergency response time of five minutes (police just under 4 minutes &amp; fire department 5.2 minutes). The parks and recreation department is nationally accredited. The Arbor Day Foundation has designated Germantown a &quot;Tree City USA&quot; for 23 consecutive years. Only 3.2% of Germantown citizens are below the poverty line.

==Geography==
Germantown is located at (35.089023, −89.793997). It is part of the Memphis metropolitan area.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.17%, is water.

==History==

Germantown was founded along the Chickasaw Trace on a ridge between the Wolf River and Nonconnah Creek, about 16 miles east of the Mississippi River.

The first settlers arrived in Germantown about 1825. Between 1825 and 1830, Miss Frances Wright established Nashoba Plantation, a utopian community intended to educate emancipated slaves and teach them a trade. By 1830, the first store was opened as more settlers moved into the area.

The community became known as Pea Ridge in 1833. Town lots were laid out in 1834 by surveyor N. T. German. The name was changed to Germantown in 1836. This coincidentally also reflected the settling of German families.

The town was incorporated in 1841. The Memphis-Charleston Railroad was built through the community in 1852. Germantown experienced setbacks through the period of the Civil War (1861–1865); the yellow fever epidemics reduced its population to a few hundred.

The town rebounded slowly. Churches destroyed in the war were rebuilt, schools were constructed and the population began to return around the turn of the century. The city name was briefly changed to Neshoba, a Chickasaw word meaning &#x27;wolf&#x27;, during World War I, because of widespread anti-German sentiment in the United States at that time.

During the twentieth century, the community derived its strength through involvement of citizens, as evidenced in the churches, garden clubs and civic organizations. The Poplar Pike Improvement Association and the Germantown Civic Club played vital roles in the physical and social development of the community.

In the last half of the century, after WWII the population grew from about 400 to more than 40,000. Over several decades, elected and civic leadership, with support of citizens, worked proactively to control suburban growth through development regulations, aesthetic controls and strategic planning efforts.

== Historical Sites ==

&quot;Old Germantown&quot; is centered around the railroad depot in downtown Germantown on Germantown Road. This was chosen as a central location by settlers in the late 19th century due to its high ground and central location. The depot was rebuilt in 1948 to replace the original structure from 1868. The depot is now home to the Germantown Train Museum. There are signs to commemorate historical sites and parks in &quot;Old Germantown.&quot;

Fort Germantown, located on Honey Tree Drive off of Poplar Pike is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It was at this site that 250 Union Soldiers built their fortification from the ground in order to guard the Memphis and Charleston railroad during the Civil War. Now, there are replicas of Howitzer cannons to mark the fort.

The John Gray House, located in Municipal Park, built prior to 1851 is one of the oldest brick homes in Shelby County. Originally located in Eads, TN, it was moved to Germantown in 1989 to prevent demolition.

==Government==

The City of Germantown operates under a Mayor-Alderman form of government. The mayor and five aldermen are elected for four year terms and are part-time positions. The Board of Mayor and Aldermen is the legislative and policy-making body of the city. The mayor does not vote except to break a tie. By charter, the mayor is the chief administrative officer; however, oversight of day-to-day management is assigned to a professional city administrator, appointed by the mayor but subject to board approval. Mike Palazzolo was elected as Mayor in November 2015 and re-elected in 2018.

More than 200 citizens annually volunteer their time, expertise and energy in service on the city&#x27;s 20-plus advisory commissions and boards. Most appointments, made by the mayor and aldermen each December, are for one year terms; most groups meet monthly. Their responsibilities range from recommendations on City government matters and community interests to identifying opportunities, challenges and solutions to conducting special activities. The commissions are Audit, Beautification, Design Review, Economic Development, Education, Environmental, Financial, Athletic Club, Great Hall, Historic, Industrial Development, Neighborhood Preservation, Parks and Recreation, Personnel, Planning, Public Safety Education, Retirement Plan Administration, Other Postemployment Benefits, Senior Citizens, and Telecommunications. The boards are Zoning Appeals, Industrial Development and Library.

<text>Millington is a city in Shelby County, Tennessee, United States, and is a part of the Memphis metropolitan area. As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 10,176. Millington was granted the title &quot;Flag City Tennessee&quot; by the Tennessee State Legislature. The Naval Support Activity Mid-South is located at the former Memphis Naval Air Station, whose function was changed in 1993 from a training base to an administrative one. There is also a general aviation airport that features the third longest runway in Tennessee.

The city is located in the Memphis Metropolitan Area, about north of Memphis. The metropolitan area of Memphis has a population of approximately 1.2 million people. Millington is close to the Meeman-Shelby Forest State Park, Fort Pillow State Park, and the Mississippi River.

==History==
The book &quot;Millington, the First Hundred Years&quot; by Faye Ellis Osteen (compiled of many stories that can not be proven fact or fiction, relies on individual witnesses and stories handed down by local families) and published by the Millington Centennial Committee outlines the history of Millington from its beginnings to the present. In 1878, Mr. and Mrs. George Millington donated a large area of land to a group of settlers for the purpose of starting a town.Mr. Millington requested that the new town be named in his honor. In 1888, the First Baptist Church was founded.It has over 5000 members. Its church is one of the largest buildings in Millington. In 1890, the first industry came to town. Since that time, job growth has been sporadic and unfocused. Millington was officially chartered by the State of Tennessee in 1903. In 1917 the US military began its initial presence in Millington. Park Field was established as a pilot training facility. With the conclusion of World War I in 1918, military pilot training ceased. It was not until 1942, with the outbreak of World War II that the military would renew its interest in Millington. In 1928 Millington Telephone was established.This business brought modern communications to Millington and the surrounding region. At the outset of World War II the US Navy established the current airport as a training facility for Navy pilots. Consistently for many decades over 15,000 military personnel were assigned to Millington. The Navy brought prosperity to the community on an ongoing basis. In 1993 the Base Realignment and Closure Commission directed the realignment of NAS Memphis which began the process of downsizing the Millington Navy facility. Flight training was moved out of Millington. However, all US Navy personnel functions were relocated to the community. At present the military and associated private contracting creates a $335 million annual economic benefit to the region. In 1986 USA Stadium was developed by Mr. W. S. &quot;Babe&quot; Howard. This sporting facility brought recognition to Millington. International baseball was played here. The Stadium continues to be an economic asset for the community. In 1993 the Millington Regional Jetport was opened as a general aviation airport. It currently is the backup airport for Federal Express(FedEx).

==Naval Support Activity Mid-South==

Millington is home to the Naval Support Activity Mid-South (NAVSUPPACT) naval station, one of the largest single employers in the state of Tennessee, with more than 7,500 military, civilian, and contractor employees on . The naval base hosts many tenant organizations, notably the Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS). Formerly known as the Naval Air Station (NAS) Memphis, a major technical training center for the United States Navy and Marine Corps comprising over , the 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission report resulted in significant changes to the base&#x27;s mission and its re-designation in 1995 as the Naval Support Activity Memphis. The airfield, which is now the Millington Regional Jetport, was turned over to the city of Millington. In 1998, the name of the naval station was changed to Naval Support Activity Mid-South to better reflect its current mission and the Navy&#x27;s approach to regionalization. Many military retirees, who live in and around Millington in order to have access to base facilities, contribute to the local economy.

This site was originally established in November 1917 as Park Field, an Army Signal Corps Aviation School used to train pilots for service with the Allied Forces during World War I. By February 1918, flight operations were in full swing, but only until November of that year when the Armistice was signed. Two days after the signing, training operations were ceased.

At that time the airfield began pioneering airmail routes throughout Tennessee and the surrounding states. In March 1920, the government officially purchased Park Field. However, the airfield continued to decline until it was little more than a storage area for aircraft and parts.

Ironically, the Stock Market Crash of 1929 breathed new life into Park Field. During the 1930s the field served as a transient camp for unemployed workers. In 1937 the Resettlement Administration took over the land and developed model farms used to demonstrate what could be achieved with correctly managed land. Park Field remained under this agency&#x27;s jurisdiction until the outbreak of World War II.

Just as the onset of World War I had given Park Field its birth in 1917, the declaration of war on December 8, 1941, had similar results, heralding the arrival of naval aviation to the Memphis area. In February 1942, the Navy Shore Station Development Board recommended approval of a reserve aviation base on the former site of Park Field.

The Naval Training Station was commissioned along with the Naval Reserve Aviation Base in 1942. On January 1, 1943, the name was changed from Naval Reserve Aviation Base to Naval Air Station Memphis. The main role of Naval Air Station Memphis was to provide aviation maintenance and pilot training. During this period of time more than 20,000 students were trained annually. Pilot training for Student Naval Aviators was discontinued after World War II, but NAS Memphis continued to thrive as home of Naval Air Technical Training Center Memphis (NATTC Memphis), providing initial and advanced technical training to various aviation operations, aviation maintenance and aviation support specialities coded under Navy enlisted aviation ratings and Marine Corps enlisted aviation Military Occupational Specialities. Training activities by these &quot;A&quot; Schools and &quot;C&quot; Schools at NATTC Memphis continued until 1993 when BRAC (Base Realignment and Closure Commission) recommended that the training schools under NATTC transfer to NAS Pensacola, Florida and occupy spaces being vacated by the former Naval Aviation Depot Pensacola (NADEP Pensacola) that was also being closed by BRAC action. During the same time period BRAC also recommended that BUPERS (Bureau of Naval Personnel) move from Virginia to Millington.

<doc id="135367" wikidata="Q1193949" url="?curid=135367" title="Carthage, Tennessee">
<text>Carthage is a town in and the county seat of Smith County, Tennessee, United States; it is part of the Nashville Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,306 at the 2010 census. It is located on the Cumberland River, which was important to its early development. It is likely best known as the hometown of former Vice President and Senator Al Gore of the Democratic Party and his father, Senator Albert Gore, Sr. The younger Gore announced his 1988 and 2000 presidential bids, as well as his 1992 vice-presidential bid, from the steps of the Smith County Courthouse.

==History==

The earliest known European-American settler in what is now Carthage was William Walton (1760–1816), who arrived in the late 1780s after the United States achieved independence in the American Revolutionary War. &quot;Circa&quot; 1800, Walton directed the construction of the Walton Road (Cumberland Turnpike), an early stagecoach route connecting the Knoxville area in the east with Middle Tennessee. The road, which was roughly paralleled later by the construction of what is now U.S. 70, was influential to the development and early settlement of the Cumberland region. Walton operated a ferry across the Cumberland River and a tavern nearby along the road, around which a small community developed. In 1804, Walton&#x27;s community was chosen as the county seat of the newly formed Smith County after a heated election, and the town of Carthage was laid out shortly thereafter.

Carthage&#x27;s location at the confluence of the Caney Fork and Cumberland rivers made it an important shipping and steamboat port throughout the first half of the 19th century. The area was developed for tobacco and hemp crops, as well as blooded livestock. Goods were shipped downstream to Nashville. During the Civil War, Carthage became an important post in the Eastern Highland Rim area of Tennessee. Carthage was selected as part of the route Confederate General Braxton Bragg marched the Army of Mississippi through on his Confederate Heartland Offensive into Kentucky. Later on March 6, 1863, Union Brigadier General George Crook established a Union outpost in Carthage to serve as a base for his effort to clear out the considerable Confederate guerrilla insurgency from East Tennessee through Middle Tennessee.

Carthage&#x27;s prominence as a river port on the Cumberland River was superseded after the railroads replaced river traffic in the later 19th century. The area&#x27;s industrial focus shifted to South Carthage and Gordonsville.

==Geography==
Carthage is located at (36.254960, -85.949211). The town is situated amid a series of low hills at the confluence of the Caney Fork with the Cumberland River, and just southwest of the latter&#x27;s Cordell Hull Lake impoundment. South Carthage is located along the opposite bank of the Cumberland to the south.

U.S. Route 70 passes east-to-west through South Carthage, connecting the area with Nashville to the west and Cookeville to the east. State Route 53 connects U.S. 70 with Gordonsville and Interstate 40 to the south. State Route 25 connects Carthage with Trousdale County and north-central Tennessee to the northwest, and State Route 80 connects the town with Macon County to the north.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

<doc id="135373" wikidata="Q2165777" url="?curid=135373" title="Blountville, Tennessee">
<text>Blountville is a census-designated place (CDP) in and the county seat of Sullivan County, Tennessee. The population was 3,074 at the 2010 census and 3,120 at the 2020 census. It is the only Tennessee county seat not to be an incorporated city or town.

Blountville is part of the Kingsport–Bristol–Bristol metropolitan area, which is a component of the Johnson City-Kingsport-Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area, commonly known as the &quot;Tri-Cities&quot; region.

==History==
The area that is now Blountville is thought to have been the location of a longhunter fort prior to its permanent settlement. The site of the town was part of a tract of about of land bought by James Brigham in 1782. In 1792 Brigham gave to Sullivan County for use as a county seat and established a hotel nearby. Blountville was laid off as a town and established as the county seat in 1795. The county&#x27;s first courthouse and jail was a log structure. In 1825 it was replaced with a brick building. By 1830, the settlement had 209 residents, two churches, six stores, two taverns, ten mechanics, one doctor, and one lawyer.

On the afternoon of September 22, 1863, during the Civil War, the town was the scene of the four-hour-long Battle of Blountville. During a major expedition into East Tennessee and Southwest Virginia, a Union Army unit attacked Confederate troops at Blountville. The town was shelled in the fighting and the courthouse was burned in the battle, which forced the Confederates to withdraw. The courthouse was rebuilt within the old walls in 1866. The current courthouse dates from a major construction that was done in 1920; it also includes additions made in 1958.

If Blountville were an incorporated town, it would qualify as the second oldest municipality in Tennessee (second only to Jonesborough); however, it was unincorporated at one point in order to avoid having redundant government services for such a small area and population. This unique status has led to some odd results, including a lawsuit in which it was ruled that neighboring Kingsport was not allowed to annex areas of Sullivan County within a defined distance of the courthouse, in effect ensuring that the county seat could not be annexed out of existence.

===Historic district===
Several of Blountville&#x27;s surviving 18th and 19th century buildings are included in an historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Deery Inn was built in the late 1700s and consists of three buildings: a two-story log home, a three-story stone house and a two-story frame building. All buildings are next to each other and attached. The home is a private residence.

<text>Bristol is a city in Sullivan County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 27,147 at the 2020 census. It is the twin city of Bristol, Virginia, which lies directly across the state line between Tennessee and Virginia. The boundary between the two cities is also the state line, which runs along State Street in their common downtown district. It is a principal city in the Kingsport–Bristol metropolitan area, which had a population of 307,614 in 2020. The metro area is a component of the larger Tri-Cities region of Tennessee and Virginia, with a population of 508,260 in 2020.

Bristol is known for being the site of some of the earliest commercial recordings of country music, showcasing Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family, and later a favorite venue of mountain musician Uncle Charlie Osborne. The U.S. Congress recognized Bristol as the &quot;Birthplace of Country Music&quot; in 1998, and the Birthplace of Country Music Museum is located nearby in Bristol, Virginia. It also is the birthplace of Tennessee Ernie Ford.

Bristol is the site of Bristol Motor Speedway, a NASCAR short track. The world&#x27;s fifth-largest coal producer, Contura Energy, is based in Bristol.

==History==
Before 1852, the land where Bristol is located was owned by Reverend James King. His son-in-law, Joseph R. Anderson of Blountville, Tennessee, bought of the plantation and named it Bristol. The G.W. Blackley House, one of the oldest houses in Bristol, was constructed in 1869.

===Country Music===

The U.S. Congress declared Bristol to be the &quot;Birthplace of Country Music&quot;, according to a resolution passed in 1998, recognizing its contributions to early country music recordings and influence, and the Birthplace of Country Music Museum is located in Bristol.

In 1927, record producer Ralph Peer of Victor Records began recording local musicians in Bristol, to attempt to capture the local sound of traditional &quot;folk&quot; music of the region. One of these local sounds was created by the Carter Family, who got their start on July 31, 1927, when A.P. Carter and his family journeyed from Maces Spring, Virginia, to Bristol to audition for Ralph Peer, who was seeking new talent for the relatively embryonic recording industry. They received $50 for each song they recorded. That same visit by Peer to Bristol also resulted in the first recordings by Jimmie Rodgers.

Since 1994, the Birthplace of Country Music Alliance has promoted the city as a destination to learn about country music and the city&#x27;s role in the creation of an entire music genre. The alliance is organizing the building of a new Cultural Heritage Center to help educate the public about the history of country music in the region. On August 1, 2014, the Birthplace of Country Music Museum opened in Bristol, Virginia to commemorate the historical significance of the Bristol sessions. The museum features a 24,000-ft building that houses core exhibits, space for special exhibits, a performance theater, and a radio station.

Every year, during the third weekend in September, a music festival called the Bristol Rhythm &amp; Roots Reunion takes place. The festival is held downtown, where Tennessee and Virginia meet, and it celebrates Bristol&#x27;s heritage as the birthplace of country music.

<doc id="135378" wikidata="Q2464943" url="?curid=135378" title="Gallatin, Tennessee">
<text>Gallatin is a city in and the county seat of Sumner County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 30,278 at the 2010 census and 44,431 at the 2020 census. Named for United States Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin, the city was established on the Cumberland River and made the county seat of Sumner County in 1802. It is located about 30.6 miles northeast of the state capital of Nashville, Tennessee.

Several national companies have facilities or headquarters in Gallatin, including Facebook, Gap, Inc., Beretta and Servpro Industries, Inc. Gallatin was formerly the headquarters of Dot Records. The city is also the site of Volunteer State Community College, a two-year college with more than 70 degree programs. In 2017, Gallatin was ranked as &quot;The Nicest Place In America&quot; by &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;.

==History==
Gallatin was established in 1802 as the permanent county seat of Sumner County, in what is called the Middle Tennessee region of the state. The town was named after Albert Gallatin, Secretary of Treasury to Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Andrew Jackson became one of the first to purchase a lot when the town was surveyed and platted in 1803. The town was built around a traditional plan of an open square. Jackson founded the first general store in Gallatin.

In 1803, the first county courthouse and jail were built on the central town square. In 1815, the town was incorporated. In the mid-20th century, it operated under a charter established by a 1953 Private Act of the State Legislature.

===American Civil War===
During the secession crisis just before the Civil War, the citizens of Gallatin hoped to remain neutral; they were opposed to secession from the Union. Once the fighting began, however, they gave almost unanimous support to the Confederacy and volunteered to serve in defense of their state.

The Union Army captured Gallatin in February 1862, following Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s capture of Fort Donelson. Gallatin was strategic both because of the railroad, which ran east–west through the state, and its location on the Cumberland River, both of which the Union Army sought to control. In July 1862, General John Hunt Morgan recaptured Gallatin and held it until October, when the Confederate forces fell back to Chattanooga.

In November 1862, Union General Eleazer A. Paine retook the town, and Union troops occupied it throughout the remainder of the war and into 1867. Paine was notoriously cruel and was replaced in command before the end of the war because of his behavior. Alice Williamson, a local 16-year-old girl, kept a diary during 1864 and described Paine&#x27;s execution of alleged spies without trial, some in the public square. Others were taken to the river and shot there. The long occupation, in which the troops lived off the land, disrupted civil society in the region.

Even before the Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863, many enslaved African Americans freed themselves by leaving farms and plantations with their families to join the Union troops in Gallatin and other parts of the state. The Army established a contraband camp here. The ex-slaves were provided food and housing, and put to work. In 1864, schools were set up in the camp to teach both children and adults to read and write.

In July 1863, some 200 local ex-slaves were among the first in the state to volunteer for the United States Colored Troops (USCT), enlisting at the Gallatin public square. They were assigned to the 13th Tennessee at Nashville. About two months later, a full regiment of 1,000 men, the 14th Tennessee USCT at Gallatin, was recruited from ex-slaves in Nashville, Gallatin and Murfreesboro.

Men from Gallatin were among those from the 12th and 13th TN Infantry USCT who built a rail line through nearby Waverly and the earthen Fort Hill near that town for regional defense.

The long enemy occupation drained the area of resources. Union troops confiscated livestock and crops from local farms. By the end of the war, widespread social and economic breakdown existed in the area, accompanied by a rise in crime. Occupation forces of the Union Army remained in Gallatin until 1870 after the war.

Through this period, many freedmen had moved from the farms into town, to gather in black communities away from white oversight. At the same time, many white residents moved from town out to farms to avoid the occupying troops. The area lost numerous men to the war and took years to recover. Its continued reliance on agriculture slowed the economy, and planters and other employers struggled with the shift to a free labor system.

===Cholera, 1873===
In summer 1873, Gallatin was devastated by an epidemic of cholera, which was part of a pandemic that had started in India in 1865. It moved west into Europe, and finally was carried by passengers on ships across the Atlantic Ocean, the third such pandemic to reach the United States. In the Mississippi River system, it started with cases first recorded in New Orleans in February 1873. The disease spread upriver with travelers to ports along the Mississippi River and its tributaries. The poor sanitation of the period resulted in contamination of water sources, a primary means of disease transmission.

The first case in Gallatin was recorded on May 29, and the patient died. During June, 68 people died in the small town, including many children. By August, the disease had largely burned out. Overall, Sumner County had an estimated 120 deaths that year from cholera, with four-fifths of them suffered by African Americans. An 1874 congressional report said that cholera had been documented in 264 towns and 18 states.

Nashville had 603 fatal cases from June 7 to 29, with 72 people dying on the day of highest fatalities. In the United States, some 50,000 people died of cholera during this pandemic, including 4,000 in Saint Louis and 3,500 in New Orleans.

Gradually through the late 19th century, Gallatin and its surroundings regained some steady growth. The area was primarily agricultural until the middle of the 20th century.

===Mid-20th century to present===
By 1970, industrialization and urbanization had resulted in half the county population being considered urban (including suburbs). In 1992, Gallatin was surpassed by Hendersonville as the largest city in the county, though the former remains the county seat. Today, it serves in part as a bedroom commuter suburb to the larger city and state capital of Nashville, some 30 miles to the southwest.

On April 7, 2006, a tornado struck the city, killing seven people and injuring 128 others. Volunteer State Community College sustained major damage. This tornado was part of a massive tornado outbreak.
On December 9, 2023, a large tornado struck the city and caused devastating destruction.

<text>Hendersonville is the most populous city in Sumner County, Tennessee, on Old Hickory Lake. As of the 2020 census the city&#x27;s population was 61,753.

Hendersonville is the fourth-most populous city in the Nashville metropolitan area after Nashville, Murfreesboro, and Franklin and the 10th largest in Tennessee. Hendersonville is located northeast of downtown Nashville. The city was settled around 1784 by Daniel Smith, whose house Rock Castle, completed in 1796, is maintained as an historic site. 

The city is named for William Henderson, the first postmaster.

==History==
In 1784 Daniel Smith received a land grant from the state of North Carolina in payment for surveying Middle Tennessee. (North Carolina at the time claimed its boundaries extended to this territory across the Appalachian Mountains.) He began work on his house later known as Rock Castle, but it was not completed until 1796. Due to his surveying trips, he frequently was gone on long journeys, and his wife supervised much of the construction.

In 1790, William Henderson settled in Sumner County and later became the namesake of the town. It was a trading center for the county, which was devoted to the production of tobacco and hemp as commodity crops, and blood livestock: both horses and cattle. During the Civil War, Monthaven was used by Union troops as a field hospital, as they occupied Middle Tennessee from 1862 to 1870. In the late 20th century, this historic home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Even before the Emancipation Proclamation of January 1863, refugee slaves with their families found their way to Union lines in the state in search of freedom. The Army established a contraband camp near Hendersonville, to offer shelter to the freedmen, help them with supplies and food, and sign them up to work for wages for the Army, often building defenses. Missionary societies helped teach both adults and children among the slaves.

The small city was not incorporated until 1969, as the area continued to be rural and devoted to agriculture and related activities. It then had roughly 250 residents and was led by L.H. &quot;Dink&quot; Newman. Since the late 20th and early 21st centuries, it has grown to become the largest city in the county.

With the completion of the Old Hickory Dam and an associated lake in 1954, Hendersonville started to develop more rapidly. The lake attracted sportsmen and people seeking recreation; some became residents or acquired second homes here. Since the late 20th century, it has become the most-populous city of Sumner County, and one of the most populous suburbs of Nashville, along with Franklin and Murfreesboro.

On December 9, 2023, a tornado hit the city and caused major damage. The tornado killed 3 people in Madison, Tennessee, and left countless others injured. The National Weather Service in Nashville issued a Tornado Emergency for Hendersonville and Gallatin, Tennessee only a few minutes before the tornado struck.

<text>Portland is a city in Sumner and Robertson counties in Tennessee. The population was 11,486 in 2010 according to estimates by the U.S. census bureau and in 2020 the population was 13,156. Portland is a part of the Nashville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Portland is located on the Highland Rim in extreme northern Middle Tennessee. This region has always been known for excellent agricultural soils, a spectacular wildlife environment and an enjoyable climate.

People were originally attracted from the tobacco belt in Virginia and the Carolinas to the Highland Rim for land speculation and production of dark tobacco. The Highland Rim offered ideal climate and soil conditions for growing dark tobacco. This lucrative crop increased the value of the land, which benefited land speculators in the area. Eventually these speculators moved on to attempt profits elsewhere. The farmers, however, remained.

The oldest local settlement in Portland is Fountain Head, which is located a couple of miles south of Portland. This settlement was founded in 1792 by the James Gwin family. Within a century, it grew to include a mill, tobacco factory, post office, a Louisville and Nashville Railroad depot, and a number of local retail stores.

William Nolan built a school near Shun Pike in what is now Portland. This stimulated community growth. Portland was originally called Richland. In 1859, the L&amp;N Railroad opened the Nashville-Bowling Green route through Portland. In the same year, a train depot was built in Richland along the railroad on property owned by Thomas Buntin. Buntin was appointed as the depot&#x27;s first agent and later became Richland&#x27;s first postmaster. The depot stimulated development in the village. Even today, the railroad runs directly through the center of town.

The first public high school in Sumner County was originally started as a seminary in 1874. It was later named Sumner County High School and opened in 1915.

In 1887, there were two towns in Tennessee named Richland. Officials of the L&amp;N railroad were worried that a telegraph mix-up might result in a train wreck. Postal customers complained of inconvenience as mail was frequently misdirected between the two Richlands. The Railroad administrators and postal authorities decided that Richland in Sumner County would be renamed as Portland to avoid this confusion. The new name was effective on April 10, 1888. Portland was incorporated in April 1904 by legislation passed by the Tennessee Assembly.

In the second decade of the 21st century, Portland is growing at a fast pace buoyed by the growth of the Nashville Metropolitan Area. Daido America operates its US headquarters in Portland. Companies such as Kyowa America and Unipres have manufacturing plants in the city as well.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and 0.09% is water.

Portland is the northern terminus of U.S. Bicycle Route 23. Portland is considered the strawberry capital of Tennessee.

<text>Atoka () is a local government area with a town charter in Tipton County, Tennessee, United States. In 1888, Atoka was a stop on the Newport News &amp; Mississippi Valley Railroad. Today the City of New Orleans Amtrak passenger train makes its daily route between New Orleans and Chicago, through Atoka. The population was 10,008 at the 2020 census, making the Town of Atoka the largest municipality in Tipton County.

Historians and genealogists can trace the Town of Atoka&#x27;s origins back to the 1838 charter of Portersville. Atoka adopted Portersville&#x27;s charter as its own. World War I Medal of Honor recipient Sgt. Joseph B. Adkison lived in Atoka, and he is buried nearby.

Five public parks exist within the town limits. The town has grown significantly since the 1990 census, at which time the population was only 659. Covington, the county seat, has the second largest population.

==History==
===Origins===
From the fiftieth anniversary of the &quot;Covington Leader&quot;, 1886 to 1936:
The trading center for the Atoka area before the rise of the town was Portersville...
&lt;br&gt;With the coming of the railroad in 1872 and opening of stores in Atoka, there grew up an intense rivalry between the two towns, but Atoka&#x27;s advantage of the railroad proved to be too much, and Portersville gradually died out. Today not a store or store building remains in Portersville and it passes into history... 

A peek into the life of John McLaughlin, a citizen of both towns, gives us some idea of what Portersville and Atoka were like:
Our subject received a collegiate education at Bellenyna College, Ireland and in 1852 came to America, landing at Charleston, S. C.; then immediately went to Chester, S. C., and spent three years learning the carriage-maker&#x27;s trade, when he moved to Aberdeen, Miss., and established a factory of his own, and three years later moved to Portersville, Tipton County, and continued the business five years, then went into merchandising and farming, selling goods at Portersville two years, then moved to Atoka and continued the mercantile business over ten years, and since that time has given his attention exclusively to farming and running a steam cotton-gin, which he owns.

===Atoka and Portersville in Tennessee, U.S.A.===
:June 1, 1796 - The Southwest Territory was admitted as the 16th state, Tennessee.

:1911 - Atoka was reincorporated.

=== Railroad ===
If the dates are taken into account, &quot;the coming of the railroad in 1872&quot; and &quot;the name of Portersville changed to Atoka in 1875&quot;. These two locations, Portersville and Atoka, existed simultaneously. The railroad came to Atoka first. Then the town of Atoka was incorporated. Atoka was an unincorporated location long before it was a chartered town.

===United States Postal Service, Rural Free Delivery in Atoka===
The official stance of the United States Postal Service, according to an article published by the Historian of the United States Postal Service in April 2008, is that Atoka was the first post office with rural free delivery in Tennessee starting on January 11, 1897. But according to an article in Tipton County&#x27;s local newspaper, published in 1936:
ATOKA ROUTE ONE IS THIRD IN UNITED STATES
The first rural route established in the South and the third established in the United States was set up at Atoka in 1895. At that time the United States Post Office Department was experimenting with rural routes. They established one in the North, one in the East, and one in the South at Atoka... The first route, which was Atoka Route 1, was 16½ miles long... Route 1 was later combined with route 2, which covers the territory from Atoka to the Mississippi River.

Another article from 1936 describes more about the post office:
Atoka&#x27;s first postmaster was D. Bowden. With the development of the United States&#x27; splendid rural delivery system in her post office department, the Atoka post office grew in importance. Today there are two rural routes reaching out from the town, serving that section from the Mississippi river on the west to Salem on the east. All mail for Munford, Drummonds, Richardson&#x27;s Landing, Randolph and other communities passes through the post office at Atoka, whose postmaster is E. M. Quisenberry and whose rural carriers are J. E. McQuiston and R. S. McDill.

<text>Brighton is a town in Tipton County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 2,735 at the 2010 census.

==History==

Brighton was established in the year 1873, along the newly completed tracts of the Memphis and Paducah Railroad upon the lands of A. W. Smith, Sr. who gave the initial five acres for the Depot grounds. The new town was named for Mr. Bright, the first conductor on the Memphis Division of the said road.

The new town grew quickly. By the late 1870s, Brighton had two dry goods stores, three grocery stores, two saloons, two blacksmith shops, two wagon shops, one brick yard, one steam saw and grist mill, one steam cotton gin, a Baptist church, two physicians, and a population of approximately 100.

In 1883, the veterans of the 7th Tennessee Cavalry, Confederate States of America made Brighton the permanent site of their annual reunion. At Brighton, the veterans reunion took on new dimensions and it grew into a reunion of all Confederate veterans of Tipton County and the surrounding region. Over the years, attendance of this annual August event grew, peaking at 15,000 in 1897. The Tipton County Confederate Veterans Reunion, as it came to be known, continued to be held at Brighton until 1940.

Brighton was incorporated by the Tennessee General Assembly in 1913 and the town today continues to operate under the same charter.

<text>Covington is a city in central Tipton County, Tennessee, United States. Covington is the second largest city and county seat of Tipton County. The city is located in West Tennessee, east of the Mississippi River. The city&#x27;s population was 9,038 at the time of the 2010 U.S. Census. Located northeast of Memphis, Covington is part of the Memphis, Tennessee Metropolitan Area.

==History==
The Covington area was originally inhabited by Native Americans of various tribes. They used the nearby Mississippi River as a trading route among numerous American Indian nations, who for more than 1,000 years conducted continent-deep trading between the upper river and the Southeast. Evidence of such trading has been found in materials and items excavated from numerous archeological sites.

Tipton County is one of five present-day counties of the State of Tennessee that border the Mississippi River. The first Europeans to explore this area were attached to the noted expedition of the French Canadians Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet in 1673. This expedition went down the Mississippi from present-day Wisconsin to the mouth of the Arkansas River, and then back upriver to Lake Michigan. The Arkansas River represents part of the border between present-day Arkansas and Mississippi. It is likely that de Soto and his men passed near here circa 1541.

During the 19th century, because this entire area consists of fertile floodplains and a climate of long, hot summers, and adequate rainfall, the Covington area and the rest of West Tennessee were developed for cotton plantations. This became the primary commodity crop across the South in the 19th century, generating great wealth for many large planters. African-American slaves were brought to Western Tennessee by planters relocating here, or forced here by sale in the domestic slave trade. West Tennessee was the center of large-scale slavery in Tennessee, and Memphis had a major slave market. Planters and farmers in Middle Tennessee also held slaves, although in fewer number. Farmers in the eastern part of the state mostly developed small subsistence farms and held few slaves.

During the Civil War, Union Army and Union Navy fought to gain control of strategic areas along the Mississippi River in order to control its traffic and split the Confederate States in two. The Confederate Army resisted, but the Union Army defeated and occupied forces in Tipton and other counties of Tennessee and northeastern Arkansas. The war ended early in the Covington area, and Tennessee was occupied by Union forces from 1862.

Starting in the 1870s during the Reconstruction era, the state legislature supported railroad construction in the region, to improve transporting crops to market. The &quot;Memphis and Paducah Railroad&quot; completed its tracks to Covington in July 1873. The first telegraph line between Memphis and Covington was completed in 1882. In 1894, electric power was installed in Covington. The city established a municipal water system in 1898 to provide residents with pure drinking water.

Twentieth-century improvements included street paving in 1922. Since 1929, a natural gas company has operated to provide cooking gas and wintertime heating to homes and business in Covington. The time that telephone service was installed in Covington is not known.

Following the invention of the automobile, during the 1910s and 1920s the United States began to construct more intercity paved highways in various regions of the county. These developed into the U.S. Numbered Highway System, and U.S. Route 51 was established. This highway connects Memphis and points south with Chicago, via Covington and Cairo, Illinois. Covington is a small town with access to a major north–south highway of commerce and travel.

Both black and white tenant farmers and sharecroppers in West Tennessee struggled with poverty as a result of lower cotton prices during the Great Depression, which added to social tensions between ethnic groups. Whites maintained their political supremacy, having disenfranchised most blacks at the turn of the 20th century. After an armed altercation during a July 1937 police raid on an illegal gambling site, Albert Gooden was arrested as a suspect in the death of a sheriff&#x27;s deputy. Because of lynching threats, the sheriff took the African-American man to be held in custody in Memphis. A month later, when the sheriff was secretly transporting Gooden back to Covington to stand trial, his car was stopped on an isolated road. Masked men took Gooden away. His body was found the next day, half in the river and shot more than 30 times. The governor offered a $5000 reward, but no one was prosecuted for the lynching. Gooden was the first man to be lynched in Tipton County since the late 19th century; his was one of several lynchings in the nation that year. It was covered by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other major newspapers.

The South Main Street Historic District in Covington includes about 50 houses from the late 19th and the early 20th centuries, along with commercial structures of historic interest.

==Geography==
Covington is part of the Memphis, Tennessee Metropolitan Area, and is located northeast of that large city. U.S. Route 51, a major north–south highway running between Mississippi and Illinois, passes through the city.

According to the United States Census Bureau, this town has a total area of , of which practically all of it is land.

Covington is situated on the southeastern edge of the New Madrid Seismic Zone, an area judged by geologists to have a high risk of earthquakes in the future.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Covington has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

Hartsville is located slightly north of the Cumberland River and is approximately fifty miles northeast of Nashville.

In 1977, the Tennessee Valley Authority began construction on the Hartsville Nuclear Plant, but cancelled the project in 1984 after spending nearly $2 billion. The plant&#x27;s unused cooling tower dominates the view south from State Route 25 between Smith County and Trousdale County. In 2016, Corrections Corporation of America (since renamed CoreCivic) opened the Trousdale Turner Correctional Center, a medium-security prison, in Hartsville. The prison became a hot spot for COVID-19 cases in the COVID-19 pandemic, giving the county the highest incidence rate in the U.S. in May 2020, with 1 in 7 residents known to be infected with coronavirus.

==History==
The first Euro-American settlers arrived in what is now Hartsville in 1797, when the family of James Hart settled along the west bank of the West Fork of Goose Creek, and the family of Charles Donoho settled along the creek&#x27;s east bank. Donoho erected a mill shortly thereafter, and the town was initially known as Donoho&#x27;s Mill. James Hart established Hart&#x27;s Ferry along the Cumberland River several miles to the south, and purchased the Donoho property in 1800. Hartsville was officially recognized as a town in 1817. Donoho&#x27;s Mill, on the east bank of the creek, had become known as &quot;Damascus,&quot; although it merged with Hartsville in 1840 when Hartsville officially incorporated.

<text>Erwin is a town in and the county seat of Unicoi County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 6,083 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Johnson City metropolitan area, which is a component of the &quot;Tri-Cities&quot; region.

==History==
The town of Erwin received its name by a mail mishap. On December 5, 1879, the name of the town was Ervin, in honor of D.J.N. Ervin, who had donated of land for the county seat. A typo made by post office officials caused the name to be recorded as Erwin. The mistake was never corrected.

===Railroads===
From 1890 to 2015 railroad operations contributed greatly to Erwin&#x27;s economic and cultural identity.

The Charleston, Cincinnati and Chicago Railroad (the Triple C) was chartered in 1886 with its headquarters in Johnson City, Tennessee. Trains ran through Erwin in 1890, but by the end of the year, the company disbanded and all construction and operation ceased.

In 1893 the Ohio River and Charleston Railway (OR&amp;C) purchased the assets of the Charleston Cincinnati &amp; Chicago Railroad in receivership and attempted to complete and operate the line. It too failed and was placed in receivership.

In 1909 the Carolina, Clinchfield and Ohio Railway (CCO) was completed, running from Dante, Virginia to Spartanburg, South Carolina, with its headquarters situated in Erwin. In 1915, this line was extended to Elkhorn City, Kentucky, to connect with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O). In 1924, its ownership and name was officially changed to the Clinchfield Railroad (CRR).

On Aug. 31, 1987 the C&amp;O railroad merged into CSX Transportation, which continued to maintain the Erwin rail yard. After acquiring 42% of Conrail in 1999, CSX became one of four major railroad systems in the nation and Erwin continued to host the rail yard, diesel shop, and car repair facility until 2015.

===Southern Potteries plant===
Between 1916 and 1957, the Southern Potteries plant operated in Erwin along Ohio Avenue. The plant produced a hand-painted dishware known as Blue Ridge that became popular nationwide in the late 1930s and 1940s. Blue Ridge pieces are still popular items with collectors of antique dishware.

===Elephant execution===
Erwin earned some notoriety in 1916 when the only known public execution of an elephant in Tennessee occurred in the community. Mary, an elephant in &#x27;Sparks World Famous Shows&#x27; traveling circus, had killed her handler, Walter Eldridge, in nearby Kingsport after the inexperienced trainer allegedly struck Mary on the head with a hook. News of a killer elephant spread via rumors and sensationalist news stories, and calls for Mary&#x27;s execution began. Some towns announced they would turn the circus away if it showed up with the elephant. Mary&#x27;s owner, Charlie Sparks, executed Mary by hanging in order to appease the crowds. Erwin was a little more than 35 miles south of Kingsport, and as home to the region&#x27;s largest railway yard they happened to have a 100-ton crane car that could lift the five-ton elephant. An estimated 2,500 people turned out at the local railway yard to see Mary hoisted by a crane to meet her demise. Playwright George Brant won the 2008 Keene Prize for Literature for his a one-act play titled “Elephant’s Graveyard”, depicting this story.

In 2015 the town implemented a yearly festival and Elephant Art Auction; whereby, artists paint fiberglass elephant sculptures displayed around town that are then auctioned, with all proceeds donated exclusively to The Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald.

===Erwin Expulsion of 1918===
On May 19, 1918, four of Erwin&#x27;s white citizens attacked a Black man named Tom DeVert during a poker game. He fled and they pursued, shooting. In the chaos, a teenage white girl named Georgia Lee Collins, who was passing by, was hit by a bullet. Devert was murdered and posthumously accused of having assaulted Collins. A group of white men dragged his body to the rail yard powerhouse, where they forced the entire Black population of Erwin to stand and witness DeVert&#x27;s body being burned on a pyre of railroad cross-ties. According to the &quot;Bristol Herald&quot; of May 21, 1918, &quot;Men with pistols, shotguns, and clubs stood before the lined up negroes to prevent their running away, and as the last cross tie and the last dash of oil was thrown on the heap one of the men is reported to have turned to the cowering crowd and said, ‘Watch what we are going to do here. If any of you are left in town by tomorrow night, you will meet the same fate.&#x27;” At the height of this atrocity, the mob leaders planned to burn the homes of all of Erwin&#x27;s Black citizens, but the local rail yard manager convinced them to forcibly evict them from the town instead. These residents, numbering 131 men, women, and children, were intimidated into abandoning their homes and goods and leaving at once.
Throughout the 20th century, Erwin was considered a sundown town. The &quot;Erwin Expulsion of 1918,&quot; as it has been called, led to the town becoming known as &quot;the place where Blacks dare not go,&quot; according to an article in the &quot;Johnson City Press-Chronicle&quot; of June 17, 1979.

===Rail yard closure===
In October 2015 CSX closed all operations in Erwin, and more than 300 people in the town were left without jobs. Town leaders attempted to fill the void by emphasizing a new identity for Erwin as an Appalachian tourist destination. This was the year that the Elephant Art Auction festivities began.

===Hurricane Helene flooding===
In September 2024, Erwin&#x27;s riverside areas were heavily damaged by flooding as a result of Hurricane Helene. 58 people had to be rescued via helicopters from the roof of Unicoi County Hospital in Erwin, with units from the Virginia State Police assisting, after the hospital was almost entirely submerged.

Part of a set of bridges on Interstate 26 spanning the Nolichucky River in Erwin were completely washed away.

==Geography==
Erwin is located at (36.145036, -82.410796), The town is situated in a valley at the confluence of North Indian Creek, which approaches from the northeast, and the Nolichucky River, which enters the valley from the mountains to the southeast. Just before reaching Erwin, the Nolichucky passes through a narrow gorge popular with whitewater rafters.

Erwin is surrounded by the Cherokee National Forest, and mountains dominate the view in all directions. Buffalo Mountain rises to the north, Rich Mountain rises to the west, and the Unaka Mountains rise to the south and east.

The Appalachian Trail passes east of Erwin. The trail crosses the Nolichucky near the western end of the Nolichucky Gorge, at a place known as Unaka Springs. Nearby is &quot;Moaning Rock&quot;, a large boulder near the trail that is supposed to be the site of a long ago murder of a stranger. According to local lore, the murdered man&#x27;s spirit is still around, and if anyone stands on or even touches the rock, &quot;...it moans as if under a heavy burden.&quot;

Interstate 26 passes through western and southern Erwin. Tennessee State Route 107 (North Main Avenue) connects Erwin to Unicoi to the north and the Embreeville area and Washington County to the west. Tennessee State Route 395 connects Erwin with the rural parts of Mitchell and Yancey counties to the east in North Carolina, crossing the Unakas at the Indian Grave Gap (the road becomes North Carolina Highway 197 at the state line).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and 0.28% is water.

<text>Unicoi is a town in Unicoi County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 3,833 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Johnson City Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City–Kingsport–Bristol Combined Statistical Area – commonly known as the &quot;Tri-Cities&quot; region.

==History==

Unicoi was originally known as &quot;Greasy Cove.&quot; In 1851, the Swingle brothers opened a post office in the community, and named it &quot;Swingleville.&quot; In 1876, Dr. F.H. Hannum obtained control of the post office, and changed its name to &quot;Limonite.&quot; When the railroads arrived in the valley in the late 1880s, the name was changed to &quot;Unicoi City,&quot; and later shortened to its current form. The town developed in the early 20th century as a shipping point for area mining and logging operations. In 1994, the municipal government of Johnson City would purchase the Buffalo Valley Golf Course located in upper Unicoi County for $1.52 million. Residents of Unicoi speculated that the purchase was a sign of Johnson City seeking to begin annexations into Unicoi. As a result, a community group gathered to incorporate Unicoi into a town by public referendum vote the following year to prevent potential annexation.

==Geography==

Unicoi is located at (36.220028, -82.338138). The town is situated in the North Indian Creek Valley (known locally as &quot;The Valley Beautiful&quot;), at a point where North Indian Creek emerges from the mountains to the southeast and bends to the southwest toward Erwin and its eventual confluence with the Nolichucky River. The northern portions of Unicoi are located in the headwaters of Buffalo Creek, which flows northeastward (in the opposite direction from North Indian Creek) and eventually empties into the Watauga River.

Unicoi is surrounded by the Cherokee National Forest. Buffalo Mountain rises prominently to the west of Unicoi, and a series of rugged hills and ridges that comprise the outer Unaka Mountains rise to the east. Erwin, the county seat, is located further down the valley to the southwest. Johnson City is located opposite Buffalo Mountain to the north.

Interstate 26, which traverses the valley, passes through western Unicoi. Tennessee State Route 107 connects Unicoi with Erwin to the southwest and the rural Limestone Cove area to the east. Tennessee State Route 173 connects the town with U.S. Route 19E.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

<text>Maynardville (originally named Liberty) is a city in and the county seat of Union County, Tennessee, United States. The city was named to honor Horace Maynard, who successfully defended the creation of Union County from a challenge from Knox County. Its population was 2,413 at the 2010 census, up from 1,782 at the 2000 census. It is included in the Knoxville metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Maynardville began in the early 19th century as a small community known as Liberty. When Union County was created in the 1850s, Liberty, being nearest the center of the county, was chosen as the county seat. The land for the courthouse square was donated by Marcus Monroe (1793–1870), a local minister.

Shortly after the Tennessee General Assembly passed legislation authorizing the creation of Union County, Knox County secured an injunction blocking the creation of the new county, which would take some of its area from Knox County. To defend the new county, its supporters retained the services of Horace Maynard (1814–1882), a Knoxville-area attorney and later U.S. Postmaster General. After Maynard successfully defended the new county in litigation proceedings, Liberty was renamed &quot;Maynardville&quot; in his honor. Union County was formally recognized in 1856.

Country music singer Roy Acuff was born in Maynardville in 1903. The Acuff family had been well-established in Union County since the mid-19th century. When Goodspeed published its &quot;History of Tennessee&quot; in 1887, the Union County section included a brief biography of Roy&#x27;s grandfather, Coram Acuff (1846–1931), who represented Union County in the state legislature.

Throughout the early to mid-20th century, State Route 33 through Maynardville was part of the infamous Thunder Road, which was used by bootleggers to illegally transport and trade moonshine. This story was later fictionally adapted into a 1958 crime-drama film and song of the same name.

Since the dawn of the 21st century, Maynardville has become increasingly suburban with the widening projects of SR 33 (Maynardville Highway) providing quicker access to Knoxville. Plans to redevelop and revitalize Maynardville have been proposed since the 2010s.

==Geography==
Maynardville is situated near the center of Raccoon Valley, a narrow valley stretching for roughly between Copper Ridge on the south and Hinds Ridge on the north. Like most mountains in the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, these two ridges are long and narrow, and often fractured into smaller hills and knobs. The Norris Lake impoundment of the Clinch River is located about north of Maynardville.

Maynardville is concentrated around a stretch of State Route 33, which connects the city to Knoxville to the southwest and Tazewell to the northeast. State Route 61 connects Maynardville with Luttrell and Blaine to the south, and State Route 144 connects Maynardville with Plainview to the southwest.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<doc id="135400" wikidata="Q2443901" url="?curid=135400" title="Plainview, Tennessee">
<text>Plainview is a city in Union County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 2,125 at the 2010 census, up from 1,866 at the 2000 census. It is included in the Knoxville, Tennessee Metropolitan Statistical Area. Plainview is located in the southern part of the county, south of Maynardville, the county seat.

==History==
Plainview would emerge into a thriving community following volunteer efforts towards the community&#x27;s school, which was built in the 1920s. The school would close in the mid-20th century, prompting residents to convert the building into a community center following the donation of the structure by the Union County Board of Education to the Plainview Community Club.

In 1981, the nearby city of Luttrell would establish proposed plans to annex the Plainview community, prompting community members to form a activist group and file a lawsuit against Luttrell in the Union County Chancery Court. The court would side in favor of Plainview, halting Luttrell from annexing the community, but would require the community to incorporate into a city in order to avoid the annexation into Luttrell. Plainview would incorporate into a city in 1992. The city government has subsequently paved many local streets, installed street lighting, enacted zoning, provided a mass recycling location and developed a walking trail.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Plainview has a total area of , all land. The city is situated along the southern base of Copper Ridge, an elongate ridge characteristic of the Appalachian Ridge-and-Valley range. The Knox County line lies just to the south, and Luttrell borders the city to the northeast. House Mountain rises prominently to the south, and Clinch Mountain rises prominently to the east.

Tennessee State Routes 131 (Tazewell Pike) and 144 (Corryton Road) intersect in Plainview.

Plainview&#x27;s City Hall is on Tazewell Pike.

<doc id="135401" wikidata="Q727248" url="?curid=135401" title="Spencer, Tennessee">
<text>Spencer is a town in Van Buren County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 1,683 as of the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Van Buren County. It is home to Fall Creek Falls State Park.

==History==
Spencer is named after Thomas Sharp Spencer (d. 1794), a long hunter who passed through the Van Buren County area in the mid-18th century. The town was established in 1850 and incorporated in 1909.

In 1942, Spencer elected a full slate of women officials.

Burritt College was located in Spencer from 1848 until its closure in 1939.

=== Fall Creek Falls State Park History ===
In 1937, the U.S. government began purchasing the badly eroded land around Fall Creek Falls. The following year, the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps began the work of restoring the forest and constructing park facilities. The National Park Service transferred ownership of the park to the State of Tennessee in 1944.

Millikan&#x27;s Overlook is named after Glenn Millikan, who was head of the Department of Physiology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and son of Nobel Laureate Robert A. Millikan. Millikan was killed by a falling rock on May 25, 1947, while rock climbing &quot;Buzzard&#x27;s Roost,&quot; the cliff beneath the overlook.

In 2006, the State of Tennessee purchased 12,500 acres (51 km2) of land along the White-Van Buren County line, in the vicinity of Bledsoe State Forest. The purchase was part of an effort to create an unbroken corridor of publicly owned land between Fall Creek Falls State Park and Scott&#x27;s Gulf, a few miles to the north in White County.

The Fall Creek Falls Inn and Conference Center offered 144 guest rooms and over 5,000 square feet (460 m2) of banquet space in five conference rooms, which accommodated up to 400 people. The buildings were designed with a brutalist architecture, having a combination of dark brick, and gray concrete with an exposed aggregate of smooth white, beige, tan, and brownish river stones. Built in the 1960s, with a rooms-only annex in the 1970s, they were closed in early April 2018 and demolished later that year, after Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam pushed for privatization and potential concessionaires refused to bid on serving the older facilities at the state&#x27;s resort parks.

Cost overruns and underestimates, and a tight labor market in such a rural area, led to a need for more money from the Tennessee General Assembly in 2019, in turn allowing construction to resume in the autumn. It is expected to finally reopen in late summer or early autumn of 2021, with only 75 to 95 guest rooms, at a cost of slightly over $40 million (up from $29 million originally). It is currently unknown how much nightly room rates will be increased.

Both counties objected to the long-term closure of the inn due to the significant loss of lodging taxes and sales taxes, as well as employees who would be left without a job or forced to relocate or commute long distances to other state parks, even when the closure and reconstruction were expected to be far shorter. Proposals to build on the opposite side of the lake before closing the original inn were declined, largely to due to the lack of sufficient sewerage facilities there.

=== Burritt College History ===
The idea for a school in Spencer was first proposed by Nathan Trogdon, a brick mason who had built the second Van Buren County Courthouse in the town. By the late 1840s, a 12-member board of trustees had been formed with Charles Gillentine as president. In 1848, the Tennessee General Assembly passed a law chartering the institution, which was named in honor of activist Elihu Burritt. Funds for the school were raised from among the residents of White, Warren, and Van Buren counties. When classes began on February 26, 1849, the college had an enrollment of 73 students and employed three teachers.

The first president of the college, Isaac Newton Jones, was a graduate of Irving College in nearby McMinnville. He established the college&#x27;s curriculum, but left after only one year. His successor, William Davis Carnes, played a critical role in shaping the college&#x27;s policies, most notably introducing coeducation in 1850 and instituting a strict moral and religious code. The policy allowing coeducation met staunch opposition at first, but Carnes defended it, stating, &quot;It is God&#x27;s law that the young of the opposite sexes should exert a healthful influence in the formation of each other&#x27;s characters, and no place is better suited to this purpose than the classroom and lecture room.&quot; To alleviate fears, Carnes modified the school&#x27;s code to bar all communication between the sexes outside classrooms or other supervised events.

Carnes&#x27; moral code barred swearing, gambling, smoking and drinking. He struggled to curtail drinking, however, in spite of introducing increasingly stringent measures, including the expulsion of anyone caught in possession of alcoholic beverages. He finally turned to local law enforcement, pleading with them to hunt down moonshiners operating in the Spencer area, and destroy their stills. In an apparent act of retaliation, the president&#x27;s house and the girls&#x27; dormitory were burned in 1857. Disgusted, Carnes resigned to become president at East Tennessee University (the modern University of Tennessee). He was succeeded by John Powell, who had been president of the Central Female Institute in McMinnville.

The college closed at the outset of the Civil War in 1861 as many of its male students left to fight in the Confederate army. The college&#x27;s relative isolation protected it during the first half of the war, though it was eventually occupied by Union troops. With the help of Carnes, who had returned to the area to escape the horrors of the war, the school briefly reopened in 1864. It was forced to close by the Union Army, however, due to concerns over Confederate guerrilla activity in the area. The Union Army occupants used the main hall as a barracks, and dormitories were converted into stables. The campus grounds were trampled and damaged, and the buildings were left in a state of ruin. At the end of the war, the college&#x27;s trustees sold part of its campus to raise funds for repairs. With Carnes&#x27; help, the school managed to reopen shortly after the close of the war. Martin White, a Burritt graduate remembered by students for having walked the entire distance from his home in North Carolina to Spencer to enroll at the school, was hired as president. Carnes was rehired as president in 1872.

During the 1870s, Thomas Wesley Brents, a physician who had recently relocated to Spencer, offered his assistance to Burritt, and began raising money for the college. With his help, the campus more than doubled in size, and a new administration building was constructed. However, Brents demanded he be made president. This angered Carnes, who resigned in 1878, allowing Brents to take over. During his four-year tenure, Brents increased the college&#x27;s enrollment and overhauled its curriculum. By the time he had resigned in 1882, however, enrollment had started to decline. In subsequent years, the school struggled financially, and was finally forced to close in 1889. The Board of Trustees considered selling the college&#x27;s campus, but ultimately decided to reopen the school.

In hopes of reviving the college, the Board hired a Burritt graduate, William Newton Billingsley, as president. Billingsley stabilized the college&#x27;s finances, and managed to increase enrollment to over two hundred students by the end of the decade. In 1897, the college reported an annual income of $25,000, 164 students, 10 teachers, and three thousand books. The early 1900s were among the most prosperous in the school&#x27;s history, as enrollment never dipped below 200 during this period.

On March 5, 1906, the college&#x27;s main building was destroyed by fire. At a meeting the following day, the college&#x27;s administrators and students agreed to finish the year and make plans to rebuild. Classes were held at the campus church and in private residences until the end of the term. The college was closed for several months while a new building was constructed. In spite of fundraising struggles, the new building was completed in 1907.

Burritt again suffered with enrollment issues following the departure of Billingsley in 1911, due in part to the opening of two state normal schools in the region: Middle Tennessee State in Murfreesboro and Tennessee Polytechnic Institute (modern Tennessee Tech) in Cookeville. The Board struggled to find a permanent president until the hiring of Henry Eugene Scott in 1918. During the 1920s, Scott overhauled the curriculum to bring it more in line with that of a typical preparatory school and junior college, offering courses in agriculture, typing, bookkeeping, and teacher training, as well as high school courses. By the 1930s, Burritt had become dependent on the Van Buren County school board for much of its funding. When the school board decided to build a county high school in 1936, Burritt was no longer able to compete for students. It finally closed in 1939.

==Geography==
Spencer is located at (35.743740, -85.458408). The town is situated at the western edge of the Cumberland Plateau, just above the Caney Fork valley. The river forms Van Buren&#x27;s boundary with White County several miles north of Spencer.

Spencer is topographically isolated by the Cumberland Plateau&#x27;s escarpment to the north and west, the Cane Creek Valley to the east, and the Dry Fork Gulf to the south. Cane Creek, along with its tributary, Dry Fork, slices a narrow valley as it spills down northward toward its confluence with the Caney Fork, effectively dividing the Spencer area from the rest of the plateau. Cane Creek&#x27;s upper watershed, known for its scenic waterfalls and geological formations, comprises the bulk of Fall Creek Falls State Park.

Spencer is concentrated along State Route 30, which connects Spencer with Pikeville in the Sequatchie Valley to the east, and McMinnville to the west. State Route 111, which traverses the eastern part of Spencer, connects the town with Sparta and Cookeville to the north, and Dunlap in the Sequatchie Valley to the south. Spencer is approximately 30 miles south of Cookeville and 25 miles west of Pikeville.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

The Black House is the oldest remaining residence in the city. Built in 1825 by Jesse Coffee, it was one of the first in the area to have a brick exterior. Its current name stems from former occupant Dr. Thomas Black and his family. Dr. Black was a Confederate surgeon during the Civil War and purchased the home following the war. Dr. Black practiced medicine at the house. In the 1980s it was deeded to his relative, Jean Leonard, who worked with the Eagle Club to begin restoration on the house. The house serves as a museum and provides tours to the public. In 1983 the house was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Jonesborough (; historically also Jonesboro) is a town in and the county seat of Washington County, Tennessee, in the Southeastern United States. Its population was 5,860 as of 2020. It is &quot;Tennessee&#x27;s oldest town&quot;.

Jonesborough is part of the Johnson City metropolitan area, which is a component of the &quot;Tri-Cities&quot; region.

==History==

Located in the far northeast corner of the state, Jonesborough was founded by European Americans in 1779, 17 years before Tennessee became a state and while the area was under the jurisdiction of North Carolina. It was named after North Carolina legislator Willie Jones, who had supported the state&#x27;s westward expansion across the Appalachian Mountains.
The town was renamed &quot;Jonesboro&quot; for a period of time, but it took back its historic spelling.

Jonesborough was originally a part of the Washington District. In 1784, it became the capital of the autonomous State of Franklin (ostensibly named after American founding father, Benjamin Franklin). Congress, however, never recognized Franklin, which was reclaimed by North Carolina in late 1788.

Tennessee and other border states into the 1830s were strong centers of abolitionist activity. The Tennessee Manumission Society was founded in 1815. East Tennessee was especially an area of Unionist leanings, made up of subsistence farmers who raised tobacco as a market crop. They had small holdings that also produced family needs. They held relatively few slaves compared to landowners in Middle Tennessee or the plantation areas of the Delta near the Mississippi River. Many became Republicans and continued to vote with that party after the war, when the other two regions of the state were dominated by Democrats.

Elihu Embree of Jonesborough founded the &quot;Manumission Intelligencier&quot; in 1819; he renamed it as &quot;The Emancipator&quot; the next year. The town was considered a center of abolitionism. The newspaper is the first American periodical to be dedicated exclusively to the issue of the abolition of slavery.

In the 1840s, the &quot;Jonesborough Whig&quot; was published here. Its publisher was William G. &quot;Parson&quot; Brownlow, who relocated it from Elizabethton, Tennessee, after about two years, under his own name. Brownlow and rival editor Landon Carter Haynes, who was also a Methodist preacher and circuit rider, brawled in the streets of Jonesborough in May 1840. Over the next several years, the two newspapermen bashed one another in their respective papers, each managing at times to thwart the other&#x27;s political ambitions. Haynes left the newspaper business in 1845, and Brownlow, who later was elected as governor, moved the &quot;Whig&quot; to the larger city of Knoxville in 1849.

From 1865 to 1873 the town was served by &quot;The Union Flag&quot;. In this period, the Jonesboro &quot;Herald &amp; Tribune&quot;, and the Jonesboro &quot;Tennessee Echo&quot;, the latter edited and published by Colonel George E. Gresham, were also published.

===Cholera pandemic, 1873===
During the summer of 1873, a cholera epidemic spread throughout the Mississippi River system, having originated in New Orleans. Part of the fourth cholera pandemic that started in India and spread west into Europe and across the Atlantic Ocean, it was believed to have been introduced to the Louisiana port by immigrants or other travelers. It spread to river towns visited by steamboats, and among neighboring settlements. None of the towns had adequate sanitation systems.

With a mortality rate of 40 to 60% and no understanding of how the disease was contracted, people dreaded an outbreak. (It was variously attributed to poor diet and miasma.) While residents of Jonesborough heard about cases in Knoxville and Greeneville, which was about 24 miles away and hard hit, their first case was not seen until July 14. Mrs. A. C. Collins died after caring for two refugees from Greeneville, who recovered. The &quot;Herald &amp; Tribune&quot; had already published a warning about cholera, and many people had left the town for what they thought were healthier locations. The newspaper did not publish again for weeks, as cholera spread rapidly in town.

Of the estimated 75 people left, 30 died by early August and another 30 contracted the disease but survived. Victims included publisher Col. George Gresham, who had devoted himself to caring for victims, and G.C. Thrasher, one of four ministers who also remained in the town during the crisis. The town received help and monies from other localities, and within a month, the disease had mostly run its course. Residents began to return to the depleted town, shaken by the disastrous month.

===Modern tourism===

Today, Jonesborough attracts heritage tourism because of its status as Tennessee&#x27;s oldest town and its rich architectural fabric, protected by local historic preservation efforts. The town&#x27;s museum describes the local heritage of small-scale tobacco farming. The historic Chester Inn, built in 1797, still stands in downtown Jonesborough.

The Jonesborough Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. The oldest surviving building in the town, the Christopher Taylor House (built in 1777 about a mile outside of the original town limits), was relocated to a lot within the historic district.

Jonesborough is the home of the International Storytelling Center, which holds the annual National Storytelling Festival on the first full weekend in October. The festival builds on the Appalachian cultural tradition of storytelling, and has been drawing people from around the world for more than 35 years. Large tents are pitched in parks around town, and storytellers sit on stages or at the head of the main tent to perform. Occasionally, performances are interrupted for a moment by passing Norfolk Southern Railway trains. Past storytellers included Carmen Agra Deedy, Syd Lieberman, and Kathryn Tucker Windham. The festival inspired the development of a successful storytelling graduate degree program at nearby East Tennessee State University.

==Geography==
Jonesborough is situated in an area where the watershed of the Watauga River meets the watershed of the Nolichucky River. The Watauga passes about to the northeast of Jonesborough, and the Nolichucky passes roughly to the southwest. The town&#x27;s principal stream, Little Limestone Creek, is part of the Nolichucky watershed.

Jonesborough is surrounded by low hills and elongated ridges that are characteristic of the Appalachian Ridge-and-Valley Province. The main crest of the Appalachians rises just a few miles southeast of Jonesborough.

Jonesborough is centered on the junction of Andrew Johnson Highway (which is part of both U.S. Route 321 and U.S. Route 11E), which connects the town to Greeneville to the southwest and Johnson City to the northeast, and State Route 81, which connects Jonesborough to Interstate 81 to the northwest and Interstate 26 at Erwin to the southeast.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

==Local legend==

A local legend holds that the ghost of Andrew Jackson occasionally appears in the vicinity of the Christopher Taylor House, a historic log cabin now in a town park. In 1788, the future U.S. president spent several months practicing law in Jonesborough while awaiting a caravan to modern-day Nashville. During this time, he lodged in a cabin belonging to Major Christopher Taylor, which was located about a mile outside of town. In 1974, this cabin was removed from its original spot and reconstructed in the town&#x27;s park, within the city&#x27;s historic district.

<text>Collinwood is a city in Wayne County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 982 at the 2010 census, down from 1,024 in 2000.

==History==

Collinwood was established in 1913 as a stop on the Tennessee Western Railroad, a rail line constructed to serve the area iron industry. The city was named for W.W. Collins, president of the Collinwood Land Company, which platted the city. While the railroad, which intersected the L&amp;N system at Iron City, was originally to extend northward to Hohenwald, plans for extension beyond Collinwood never materialized, and the city became the railroad&#x27;s western terminus.

The Collinwood Land Company advertised lots for the new city in June 1913, and by the following year, about 300 people were living in the city. Most of the residents worked for the railroad or in the local lumber industry. During World War I, Collinwood&#x27;s economy boomed, and its population swelled to over 2,000. A wood alcohol (methanol) distillation plant and blast furnace were constructed in the years following the war, but as demand for these products fell, the economy collapsed and the city began to decline. The tracks connecting Collinwood with the L&amp;N system were abandoned in the late 1930s.

The Collinwood Railroad Station, built in 1916, still stands near the center of the city, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The station, which mostly follows design patterns typical of L&amp;N depots of the period, is the last major remnant of the area&#x27;s railroad history. The station now serves as a library and museum.

==Geography==
Collinwood is located at (35.170153, -87.742731). The city is situated on a relatively broad plain surrounded by low hills and hollows. Streams in the eastern part of the city are part of the Shoal Creek watershed, while streams in the western part are tributaries of Indian Creek (both Shoal Creek and Indian Creek empty into the Tennessee River).

Collinwood is concentrated along a stretch of State Route 13, roughly halfway between Waynesboro to the north and the Tennessee-Alabama state line to the south. State Route 203 intersects SR 13 at the southern tip of Collinwood, connecting the city with Savannah to the west. The Natchez Trace Parkway traverses Collinwood from northeast to southwest.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

<text>Martin is a city in Weakley County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 10,825 according to the 2020 census. The city is the home of the University of Tennessee at Martin.

==History==
Martin is named for Captain William Martin. William Martin was born in Halifax County, Virginia in 1806, and moved to Weakley County, Tennessee with his wife Sarah in 1832. Captain Martin prospered through tobacco farming and began working to establish a railroad connection in what would later become Martin in 1852. It was not until after his death in 1859 that his sons, led primarily by George W. Martin, persuaded the Mississippi Central Railroad to locate a connection with the Nashville and Northwestern Railroad in what would become Martin, Tennessee in 1872.

Martin was initially named Green Briar Glade and then renamed Frost in honor of an official of the Illinois Central Railroad. George W. Martin, M. P. Martin and W. H. Martin sold to the Mississippi Central Railroad on February 11, 1874, for $5. The railroad renamed the area Martin in honor of William Martin and to better advertise the area. Surveyor H. C. Draughon layed out the town on September 22, 1874, and a petition of incorporation was filed by G.W. Martin, A.M. Clemons, and Draughon on September 24. A majority of the 36 residents voted in favor of the incorporation on November 27, and John L. Smith was appointed mayor. B.F. Crawford was elected mayor on February 5, 1875, alongside six aldermen and a constable.

In 1878, a yellow fever outbreak infected 400 of the 500 inhabitants and killed 52. A smallpox epidemic broke out during the tenure of Mayor James E. Kennedy. Concrete sidewalks and gravel streets were built during the mayoral tenure of Wiley Blakemore. The city&#x27;s sewer system was built under Mayor J.T. Perkins.

&quot;Esquire&quot; listed Martin as one of the happiest towns in the United States in 1970.

<text>Sparta is a city in and the county seat of White County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 5,001 in 2020.

The Calfkiller River flows through the city. Seven sites in Sparta are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==

Sparta was established in 1809 as a county seat for White County, which had been created in 1806. The city was named after the ancient Greek city-state Sparta. 
Sparta nearly became the capital of the state of Tennessee, as, early in the history of Tennessee, the state legislature voted to choose a location for the permanent state capital. The final vote resulted in a near tie between Sparta and Nashville. Sparta lost to Nashville by one vote.

Sparta grew quickly due to its location along the stage road between Knoxville and Nashville. In the 1830s, brothers Barlow and Madison Fisk built the Sparta Rock House, which served as an inn along the stage road. The Rock House, strategically situated in an area where the Cumberland Plateau gives way to the Calfkiller valley, was a common stopover for figures important to the early history of the state, including Andrew Jackson and Sam Houston. The building is now a state historic site and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Sparta is notable as a place where two renowned airmen lost their lives. Hawthorne C. Gray, an aviation record holder, died in a balloon-basket mishap over Sparta in 1927, and Lansing Colton Holden Jr., a World War I flying ace, crashed his plane near Sparta in 1938.

Teenagers Erin Foster and Jeremy Bechtel went missing in Sparta in 2000, and were not discovered until February 2022 when scuba diver Jeremy Sides found Foster&#x27;s vehicle in the Calfkiller River.

==Geography==
Sparta is located at (35.932335, -85.469837), approximately fifteen miles south of Cookeville. The city is situated on the Highland Rim, near the western base of the Cumberland Plateau. The Calfkiller River traverses Sparta north-to-south en route to its confluence with the Caney Fork several miles to the south.

Sparta is traditionally concentrated around its courthouse square along U.S. Route 70 (signed locally as Bockman Way), which connects Sparta with Crossville to the east and Smithville to the west. State Route 111, which traverses the western part of Sparta, connects the city with Cookeville to the north and Spencer to the south. A modern commercial area has developed around the intersection of US 70 and SR 111. State Route 84 winds its away up the Calfkiller Valley, connecting Sparta with Monterey atop the Plateau to the northeast. U.S. Route 70S connects Sparta with McMinnville to the southwest.

The Upper Cumberland Regional Airport is north of Sparta.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==Climate==
Sparta&#x27;s climate is humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;) under the Köppen system, with mild winters and hot, humid summers. Under the Trewartha system, it is a borderline humid subtropical (&quot;Cf&quot;) and oceanic (&quot;Do&quot;) climate, supported by the fact that subtropical plants like Southern Magnolia and the occasional Needle Palm can reach their full potential here but struggle much further north.

==History==

Successive cultures of prehistoric Native Americans occupied this area for thousands of years. In the first millennium of the Common Era (CE), Mississippian culture people, known locally as the Mound Indians or Stone Box Indians, built complex earthwork mounds topped with ceremonial buildings. Their settlement was part of a culture that throughout the Mississippi Valley and its major tributaries, and traded with other groups across the continent.

Artifacts and mounds of the Mississippian culture have been found during development in the Meadowlake subdivision, and at the library site on Concord Road. Primm Historic Park contains and preserves the largest of the earthwork mounds, which is still visible today. By 1300 these people had largely abandoned this settlement; archeologists have struggled to determine the reasons. There may have been epidemic disease, environmental problems, or warfare with other tribes.

===European-American settlement===
When early European-American settlers arrived in this area in the late 1700s from east of the Appalachian Mountains, it was largely being used as a hunting ground by Native American tribes from Georgia and Alabama. This resulted in many conflicts as the whites encroached on their territory and competed for their resources. In 1786, soon after the United States gained independence, Creek or Cherokee warriors raided the Mayfield family fort, at a site that is now the intersection of Wilson Pike and Old Smyrna Road. Southerland Mayfield and two other men were killed, and the boy George Mayfield was taken captive. One of the Creek families adopted him, as was their practice with war captives. Most Native American tribes adopted young captives to replace individuals they had lost to illness or warfare. After ten years, George Mayfield was returned to European-American society.

Some of the first European-American families here were those headed by James Sneed, Robert Irvin Moore, Thomas Hardeman, Gersham Hunt, Samuel and Andrew Crockett, and John Edmondson, who arrived well before 1800. The Holts, Herberts, Frosts, Hadleys, Hightowers, McGavocks, and Owens soon followed. Many of these families had received land grants in this area because of the men&#x27;s service in the Virginia or North Carolina militia during the Revolutionary War. Many of these families&#x27; historic homes have been preserved and may be seen in the 21st century.

What is now called the Cool Springs House in Crockett Park, was first owned by Dr. Robert Carothers and his wife Martha Crockett. They built it at where the intersection of Mallory Lane and Cool Springs Boulevard is now located. Through the years, it passed through numerous owners and renovations. In 1974, the city of Brentwood moved the house to its current location of Crockett Park. Its former site was in an area of rapid growth and development that threatened preservation of the historic asset.

The Frost place on Old Smyrna Road was a center of frontier businesses, with a general store, grist mill, and post office soon developed located there. Settlers planted churches, predominately Methodist, and built up community life. When the railroad was constructed through this area, it established a depot in the town. The city realigned around the depot, which was the link to the newest form of transportation. It became the center of commerce for the present downtown area. The village of Brentwood thrived as the area was developed for cotton plantations.

===Civil War===
During the American Civil War, on March 25, 1863, Confederate Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest led a column of men into Union-controlled Brentwood, intent on recapturing this section of the Nashville &amp; Decatur Railroad. Forrest performed a quick sneak attack on Union Lt. Col. Edward Bloodgood. Forrest had cut the telegraph wires, isolating Bloodgood as he brought in heavy artillery. Bloodgood surrendered Brentwood that day, which was a significant loss for the Federals. Overall, there were 305 Union and 6 Confederate casualties. Much of Brentwood was destroyed in the battle.

After the Civil War, many of the large plantations were sold or had plots leased to freedmen sharecroppers and tenant farmers. Smaller farms dotted the countryside. Tobacco became the commodity crop of choice. The population was stable for almost 100 years.

===20th century to present===
In the 1930s, even during the Great Depression, Brentwood began to rebound. One by one, businessmen and merchants from Nashville bought the former plantation houses. They began to revive fox hunting on their estates and raise quality horses.

On April 15, 1969, Brentwood incorporated as a city. That same year the interstate was built through the area, ushering a new period of residential and commercial growth. It made commuting easier for people who worked in Nashville and wanted to live in newer housing. The Maryland Farms office complex was built a few years later on what was once an American Saddle Horse farm and race track. The Brentwood Derby was run there until the mid 1970s.

Development has continued as Nashville has expanded its economy. In August 2016, developers announced a $270 million project in the Cool Springs area. It was to include commercial, hotel and retail development.

<doc id="135422" wikidata="Q984264" url="?curid=135422" title="Franklin, Tennessee">
<text>Franklin is a city in and the county seat of Williamson County, Tennessee, United States. About south of Nashville, it is one of the principal cities of the Nashville metropolitan area and Middle Tennessee. As of 2020, its population was 83,454. It is the seventh-most populous city in Tennessee. Franklin is known to be the home of many celebrities, mostly country music stars like Billy Ray Cyrus and Pop Singer Miley Cyrus.

The city developed on both sides of the Harpeth River, a tributary of the Cumberland River. In the 19th century, Franklin (as the county seat) was the trading and judicial center for primarily rural Williamson County and remained so well into the 20th century as the county remained rural and agricultural in nature.

Since 1980, areas of northern Franklin have been developed for residential and related businesses, in addition to modern service industries. The population has increased rapidly as growth moved in all directions from the core. Despite recent growth and development, Franklin is noted for its many older buildings and neighborhoods, which are protected by city ordinances.

== History ==

===18th century===
The City of Franklin was founded October 26, 1799, by Abram Maury Jr. (1766–1825). Later a state senator, he is buried with his family in the current Founders Pointe neighborhood. Maury named the town after national founding father Benjamin Franklin.

Ewen Cameron built a log house in 1798, the first in the new settlement. Cameron was born February 23, 1768, in Bogallan, Ferintosh, Scotland. He emigrated to Virginia in 1785 and came to Tennessee shortly after it was admitted to the Union. Cameron died on February 28, 1846, after living 48 years in the same house. He and his second wife, Mary, were buried in the old City Cemetery. Some of his descendants continue to live in Franklin.

===19th century===
This area is part of Middle Tennessee, and farmers prospered in the pre-Civil War years, with the cultivation of tobacco and hemp as commodity crops, and raising of livestock.

During the Civil War, Tennessee was occupied by Union troops from 1862. Franklin was the site of a major battle in the Franklin–Nashville Campaign. The Second Battle of Franklin was fought on November 30, 1864, resulting in almost 10,000 casualties (killed, wounded, captured, and missing). Forty-four buildings were temporarily converted to use as field hospitals. The Carter, Carnton, and the Lotz houses from this era are still standing and are among the city&#x27;s numerous examples of period architecture.

After the Civil War, slavery was abolished and the franchise was extended to African-American men. Most joined the Republican Party, which had gained their freedom.

On July 6, 1867, a political rally of Union League Black Republicans in Franklin was disrupted by Conservatives, who were mostly White but included some Blacks. Later that evening, what became known as the &quot;Franklin Riot&quot; broke out. Black Union League men were ambushed by Whites at the town square and returned fire. An estimated 25 to 39 men were wounded, most of them Black. One White man was killed outright, and at least three Black people died of wounds soon after the confrontation.

On August 15, 1868, in Franklin, Samuel Bierfield became the first Jewish man to be lynched in the United States. He was fatally shot by a large group of masked men believed to be Ku Klux Klan (KKK) members. They attacked him for treating Blacks equally to Whites in his store. Bowman, a Black man who worked for Bierfield and was with him at his store, was fatally wounded in the attack and soon died.

After the Reconstruction era, white violence continued against African Americans, as the minority struggled to retain dominance. Violence increased toward the turn of the century, and whites used intimidation and attacks to keep Blacks away from voting.

Five African Americans were lynched in Williamson County from 1877 to 1950, most during the decades around the turn of the century. It was a time of high social tensions and legal racial oppression in the South. These murders took place in Franklin, when men were taken from the courthouse or county jail by mobs before trial.

Among them was Amos Miller, a 23-year-old Black man who was forcibly taken from the courtroom by a White mob during his 1888 trial in a sexual assault case. He was hanged from the railings of the balcony of the county courthouse. The alleged victim was a 50-year-old woman. On April 30, 1891, Jim Taylor, another African-American man, was lynched on Murfreesboro Road in Franklin by another mob, accused of killing a White man.

A memorial to Confederate soldiers was erected in 1899 by fourteen women of the United Daughters of the Confederacy to honor Confederate soldiers, including the 6,125 casualties of the Battle of Franklin. A news report described how as the last piece of the statue was being raised, a buggy ran into a rope, causing the statue to swing into the shaft, breaking out a piece from the hat of the figure. This event resulted in many nicknaming the monument as &quot;Chip&quot;.

===20th century to present===
Population growth slowed noticeably from 1910 to 1940 (see table in Demographics section), as many African Americans left the area in the Great Migration to northern industrial cities for jobs and to escape Jim Crow conditions.

One of the first major manufacturers to establish operations in the county was the Dortch Stove Works, which opened a factory in Franklin in 1928. The factory was later developed as a Magic Chef factory, producing electric and gas ranges. (Magic Chef was prominent in the Midwest from 1929.) When the factory was closed due to extensive restructuring in the industry, the structure fell into disuse. The factory complex was restored in the late 1990s in an adaptation for offices, restaurants, retail and event spaces. It is considered a &quot;model historic preservation adaptive reuse project&quot;.

Since the late 20th century, however, Franklin has rapidly developed as a suburb of Nashville, Tennessee. Franklin&#x27;s population has increased more than fivefold since 1980, when its population was 12,407. In 2010, the city had a population of 62,487. Census estimates, it is the state&#x27;s seventh-largest city. In 2017, the City of Franklin was ranked the 8th fastest-growing city in the nation by the U.S. Census Bureau, increasing 4.9 percent between July 1, 2016, and July 1, 2017.

After the passage of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, some Franklin residents have worked to identify and preserve its most significant historic assets. Five historic districts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as are many individual non-historic but older structures.

Franklin is home to an armed forces memorial, on the grounds of the Williamson County Archives. It honors Williamson County men who served in American wars from the Creek War to the Gulf War. Around the seal of Franklin are placed engraved bricks that radiate in a circle. The largest brick is in honor of George Jordan, an African-American man and former slave. As a Buffalo Soldier, he fought in the Indian Wars in New Mexico. He is the only man from Williamson County to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.

Historic preservation and church leaders developed the &quot;Fuller Story&quot;, a project to recognize the lives and contributions of African Americans to Franklin. In October 2021 a statue of a soldier of the United States Colored Troops was installed in front of the old Williamson County Courthouse on Franklin Square. It marks the contributions of thousands of African Americans in ending the Civil War and reuniting the Union. The square was the site of a former slave market and it holds the Confederate monument.

The &quot;Fuller Story&quot; project was approved by the Franklin Board Of Mayor and Aldermen. Before the statue was erected, in 2018, the first of several planned historic plaques was installed; these mark the history of slavery, the Reconstruction era and Jim Crow, and civil rights in Franklin.

Dickens of a Christmas is an annual event that attracts approximately 50,000 visitors. It takes place in Historic Downtown Franklin and is celebrated during the second week in December. Costumed volunteers masquerade as figures from Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. Music and dancing are a big part of the festival, and local school and church musical groups often perform. Victorian cuisine is served to visitors, and an arts and crafts bazaar features prominently in Public Square.

<text>Nolensville is a town in Williamson County, Tennessee. Its population was 13,829 at the 2020 census. It was established in 1797 by William Nolen, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War. Located in Middle Tennessee, it is about 22 miles southeast of Nashville. The town was reincorporated in 1996.

==Geography==
Nolensville is located at (35.956786, -86.666967).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , consisting entirely of land.

==History==
This area was settled by European Americans after the American Revolutionary War, when pioneers began to move west of the Appalachian Mountains. William Nolen, a war veteran, his wife, Sarah, and their five children were passing through the area in 1797 when their wagon wheel broke. Surveying his surroundings, Nolen noted the rich soil and abundance of natural resources. He decided to settle here and the community was later named for him as Nolensville. William Nolen purchased a portion of a land grant made to Jason Thompson, on which Nolensville later developed. Nolen&#x27;s historic house was moved to a new location in 2009.

In the early 19th century, a large migration from Rockingham, North Carolina, brought the Adams, Allen, Barnes, Cyrus, Fields, Glenn, Irion, Johnson, Peay, Scales, Taylor, Vernon, Wisener, Williams, and other families to the area. Built along Mill Creek, the town was incorporated in 1839.

Foraging and skirmishing took place here during the Civil War. Gen. John Wharton&#x27;s Confederate cavalry unit was stationed in town briefly and Gen. Joseph Wheeler&#x27;s command captured a Union supply train here on December 30, 1862. A small group of soldiers from the 2nd Minnesota Volunteer Infantry successfully defended a Union wagon train against a much larger Confederate cavalry force in February 1863, with several of them earning the Medal of Honor for their actions.

From the post-Reconstruction period into the early 20th century, Whites lynched a total of five African Americans in Williamson County. They did not allow the legal system to prosecute these men, but conducted extrajudicial murder. Among the victims was 15-year-old Samuel Smith, an African American who was lynched in Nolensville in December 1924. He was arrested there for shooting and wounding Ike Eastwood at his house, after Eastwood shot Smith&#x27;s uncle; the grocer also shot and wounded Smith. Smith was taken for treatment to a hospital in Nashville. A group of masked men took him from the hospital, and with a larger mob, back 22 miles to Nolensville. There, the mob hanged the youth near Eastwood&#x27;s house and shot him multiple times. Although the Nashville Chamber of Commerce offered a $5000 reward in the case, no one was convicted of Smith&#x27;s murder. On June 5, 2017, a plaque was installed in his memory at St. Anselm Episcopal Church in Nashville; it memorialized two other local lynching victims, as well.

===Post-World War II to present===
On both sides of Nolensville Road, from north of Oldham Drive to the south as far as York/Williams Road, are many structures from the 19th century that are still in use as homes and/or stores. The Home Place Bed and Breakfast was built in 1820 as a private residence. Within the described area above is a historic section, which in the 19th century was the center of Nolensville. Of note are the Waller Funeral Home, built in 1876; the Nolensville Mill Company, which operated from 1890 to 1986 (today it houses a store featuring Amish goods); and the Nolensville Co-Op Creamery, which operated from 1921 to 1957. Now serving as an antique store, the creamery had produced butter known for its excellence throughout the area. The house north of the cemetery today serves as a veterinary clinic.

Nolensville voted by referendum to reincorporate in August 1996. In October 1996, the first election was held, electing the first three-member Nolensville board of mayor and aldermen. The first mayor of Nolensville was Charles F. Knapper, elected along with Aldermen Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Dugger, III, and Parman Henry. The town for the first time hired a town attorney, Robert J. Notestine, III.

Since 1996, Nolensville has had sustained growth. New home developments have been built around the town, including Bent Creek, Winterset Woods, Burkitt Place, Silver Stream, Ballenger Farms, Sunset Farms, and Summerlyn. Nolensville has had 290 residential building permits since the 2010 census; it boasts of having the lowest property tax rates in Williamson County. Other signs of growth are the new multimillion-dollar town hall, proposals for multiuse developments, and a high level of investment in commercial real estate.

To accommodate the many new students brought by families settling in the area, the Williamson County School Board purchased on the south side of Nolensville for the construction of new elementary, middle, and high schools. These opened in the fall of 2016.

Prior to the city&#x27;s establishment, the land was a Revolutionary War grant to Colonel Archibald Lytle and his brother William.

&quot;Circa&quot; 1790, the grandparents of Watertown&#x27;s founder, Wilson L. Waters, moved into the area. In 1845, the post office moved from nearby Three Forks to Wilson&#x27;s store. Waters expanded his operations with a sawmill, gristmill and blacksmith shop. Waters&#x27; farm eventually became Watertown.

The Nashville and Knoxville Railroad built a depot in Watertown in 1885, making it the hub of business in the area. The increased business led to a doubling of the village&#x27;s size.

<text>Elkhart is a town the U.S. state of Texas, in Anderson County. Named for a friendly Native American who assisted the early settlers of the area, Elkhart&#x27;s population was 1,287 at the 2020 U.S. census.

== History ==
The history of Elkhart starts with Daniel Parker&#x27;s Pilgrim Predestinarian Baptist Church. It was formed in Crawford County, Illinois in 1833, because the government of Mexico would not allow the Baptist church&#x27;s organization within their borders. Daniel, and his father John Parker, led their congregation to Texas, settling in Austin&#x27;s Colony in 1834. While John Parker&#x27;s group settled and established Fort Parker (Limestone County), Daniel&#x27;s group settled first in the territory that became Grimes County and later moved to the area around Fort Houston (Anderson County). Daniel Parker spent his time traveling and preaching in the homes of his scattered congregation. In 1836, the threats of General Santa Anna&#x27;s troops in April 1836, and the attack of Fort Parker in May 1836 sent the remnant of John Parker&#x27;s group to seek protection near Fort Houston. The Pilgrim Church resumed meetings in February 1837, and resolved in 1839 to build a church house, selecting 2.5 acres &quot;on the north side of the bluff of the Harrison Fork of Bayou Blue near Daniel Parker&#x27;s house&quot;. They constructed a log house and cleared a burial ground where Daniel Parker was buried in 1844. The church, now called Old Pilgrim Church, which has been replaced several times since the first log house, was the center of the community called Parker&#x27;s Settlement, or just Pilgrim.

About the same time Parker&#x27;s followers were getting established, the first Methodist sermon was given by Rev. William Stevenson, whose members built their church about 1840, one mile west of Pilgrim Baptist Church.

The community was granted a post office in March 1850, named Elkheart (later changed to Elkhart) which was located four miles south of Elkhart&#x27;s current position, and named for a Native who had helped the early settlers.

As the Houston to Palestine rail was being finished in 1872, Elkhart shifted north to the train depot, and thus began to be considered the &quot;railroad village&quot; associated with the Parker settlement.

== Geography ==

The Miller house still stands as a historical landmark in the southeastern part of town, on ACR 19. The state bought the land from him and named the city in his honor. The original Main Street still holds the name Miller Street. The junction of Highways 155 and 175 is now the center of the town.

<text>Palestine ( ) is a city in and the seat of Anderson County in the U.S. state of Texas. It was named after Palestine, Illinois, by preacher Daniel Parker, who had migrated from that town. It is also contested that Micham Main named Palestine after his hometown, also Palestine, Illinois, when he and his family arrived here along with the Parker family and several others.

The city had a 2020 U.S. census population of 18,544, making it the sixth-largest incorporated municipality in Northeast Texas by population. Palestine is a relatively small city located in the Piney Woods, equidistant from the major cities of Dallas, Houston, and Shreveport, Louisiana.

It is notable for its natural environment, and has a notable dogwood blooming season. It has 23 historical sites on the National Register of Historic Places, and was the western terminus of the historic Texas State Railroad. Today, this steam-and-diesel railroad museum operates tourist trains between Palestine and Rusk.

==History==
Indigenous groups, such as the Coushatta Tribe, occupied this area for thousands of years before European encounter. During the years of Spanish and Mexican control of major parts of the Southwest, what became East Texas was lightly settled by Europeans.

===Founding===
A trading post was established by Anglo-Americans circa 1843, and some settlers gathered around it. In 1846, the Texas Legislature incorporated Palestine to serve as a seat for the newly established Anderson County. James R. Fulton, Johnston Shelton, and William Bigelow were hired by the first Anderson County commissioners to survey the surrounding land and lay out a town site. This consisted of a central courthouse square and the surrounding 24 blocks.

The city was named after Palestine, Illinois, as suggested by Micham Main and or Daniel Parker, a minister of Pilgrim Church who had migrated with the Main family and numerous other settlers from that town.

By 1858, Palestine had grown to a population of about 2,000. An 1861 state almanac showed that the city was connected to the rest of Texas via a tri-weekly stagecoach that served Huntsville, Crockett, and Nacogdoches. In 1861, a joint resolution called for the construction of the &quot;Metropolitan Railroad&quot; from Texarkana to Austin, passing through Palestine, Henderson, and Fairfield. These plans were interrupted when the American Civil War broke out.

In the postwar period, during the Reconstruction era, the timber trade and town growth were stimulated in the 1870s by the construction of a railroad through here. The city had a population of more than 10,000 by 1898.

===Railroad===
The International Railroad and the Houston and Great Northern Railroad first connected Palestine to the city of Hearne in 1872. Later that year, it was connected northeast to Longview. The railroad merged in 1873 to become the International and Great Northern Railroad (IGN).

The IGN later became part of the Missouri Pacific Railroad, and ultimately, the Union Pacific Railroad. In 1875, IGN president H.M. Hoxie moved to Palestine and built the first Victorian mansion there. Successful merchant owners and railroad executives built other elaborate homes along South Sycamore Street.

The IGN built a major depot in 1892, and a modern passenger coach shop in 1902, making Palestine an important locomotive and coach location. These shops continued to operate until 1954. At that time, the present facility was built, which is exclusively for freight-car repair.

Today, the Palestine Car Shop is one of only two car shops on the Union Pacific Railroad that perform major modifications and repairs to freight cars. The Palestine UP workforce has more than 100 employees.

After the state completed the Rusk Penitentiary near the city of Rusk, the state leased convict labor to the railroad as workers. The railroad originally transported raw materials to the iron smelter located at the Rusk Penitentiary. In 1906, the line reached Maydelle, and by 1909, the line was completed when it reached Palestine.

Regularly scheduled train service ceased in 1921. The line was leased to various railroad companies until 1969, when they abandoned it during national restructuring of the industry. The Texas Legislature adapted the railroad as a state park in 1972, to be devoted to operating trains that showed some of the state&#x27;s railroad history.

The Texas State Railroad is a state park that allows visitors to ride trains pulled by diesel and steam locomotives between the park&#x27;s Victorian-style depots and through the forests of East Texas. This short railroad line dates to 1883.

===Modern era===
In 1914, the county&#x27;s fifth courthouse was completed. It is still in use. One of the many historical sites is Sacred Heart Catholic Church, which was designed by Nicholas J. Clayton.

In 1928, oil was discovered at Boggy Creek, east of Palestine. The production of oil resources added to and diversified the town&#x27;s economy. Palestine became a center for oil-well servicing and supplies in support of other producing fields found later elsewhere in Anderson County.

Construction of the earth-filled Blackburn Crossing Dam on the Upper Neches River, creating Lake Palestine as a reliable source of water, was begun in 1960, and completed in 1962. A municipal water authority manages this resource. The dam was enlarged from 1969 to 1972 to 75 feet high, and 5,720 feet long.

About 40% of the content from the 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster was recovered, seven astronauts were killed in the accident. Debris from &quot;Columbia&quot; was found in and outside Palestine and other East Texas towns. Palestine&#x27;s NASA Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility (renamed in honor of the shuttle crew), has flown 1,700 high-altitude balloons for universities and research agencies.

On November 15, 2015, a mass shooting took place at a campsite several miles northwest of Palestine. Six people were killed by an intoxicated neighbor who was upset about losing his family&#x27;s land. The shooter was charged with capital murder. He was convicted and sentenced to death by a Brazos County jury on November 15, 2017.

==Economic development==
Andrews is a city built on oil and soil. After the first oil well was drilled (1929) by Deep Rock Oil Company on Missourian Charles E. Ogden&#x27;s property, Andrews County became one of the major oil-producing counties in Texas, having produced in excess of of oil. The cyclical nature of the oil business (as well as diminishing production on existing wells), though, has caused the community to look into new means of economic development, such as waste disposal, which in some areas has caused controversy.

Waste Control Specialists (WCS), owned by Harold Simmons and headquartered in Dallas, Texas, operates a site in Andrews County on the border with New Mexico. The company was awarded a license to dispose of radioactive waste by the TCEQ in 2009. The permit allows for disposal of radioactive materials such as uranium, plutonium and thorium from commercial power plants, academic institutions, and medical schools. The company finished construction on the project in 2011 and started disposing of waste in 2012. Two radioactive waste landfills are at the site. The 30-acre compact site is owned and regulated by the State of Texas for use by Texas, Vermont, and up to 36 other states. The 90-acre federal site is owned by the United States federal government and is used for Department of Energy and other federal waste. The company employs 130 people or about 1% of the total labor force in Andrews.

For years, a dispute has been simmering concerning to which state these waste sites belong: Texas or New Mexico? The straight north–south border between the two states was originally defined as the 103rd meridian, but the 1859 survey that was supposed to mark that boundary mistakenly set the border between 2.29 and 3.77 miles too far west of that line, making the waste sites, along with the current towns of Farwell, Texline, and part of Glenrio, appear to be within the State of Texas. New Mexico&#x27;s short border with Oklahoma, in contrast, was surveyed on the correct meridian. New Mexico&#x27;s draft constitution in 1910 stated that the border is on the 103rd meridian as intended. The disputed strip, hundreds of miles long, includes parts of valuable oilfields of the Permian Basin. A bill was passed in the New Mexico Senate to fund and file a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court to recover the strip from Texas, but the bill did not become law. Today, land in the strip is included in by the way in Texas land surveys and the waste sites for all purposes are taxed and governed by Texas.

The city was set to be the location of the now defunct $400 million HT3R project.

In 1972, Andrews became the site of the first Kirby Company vacuum cleaner factory outside of the original location in Ohio. It is often referred to as &quot;Kirby West&quot; to signify the westward expansion of the company, which employs about 200 people.

In 2011, the city opened Business Park South to provide more incentive options for attracting businesses. Energy Business Park was also opened by the city in 2014.

The city completed more than $3 million in airport renovations. Voters approved bonds to construct a new $13 million loop around town, which opened in October 2013. A new $2 million fire station opened at the end of 2013. A new $60 million hospital opened in 2015.

Stores in the town began to sell alcohol for the first time on December 19, 2013.

A $28-million jail broke ground in April 2019. A $5-million expansion of city hall and new food bank were also started.

==Education==
Students are served by the Andrews Independent School District. The school opened two new $18.5 million elementary school campuses and a $20 million performance center at the high school in 2008.

The high school started issuing laptop computers to each student in 2012. The elementary and middle-school campuses also began to issue iPad tablets to all students. Students are allowed to take the devices home, but must return them at the end of the school year.

Due to increased enrollments, several construction projects began construction in 2013. New classrooms were added to all school campuses.

A $53-million bond was passed in 2018 for new construction due to growth.

A $156.7-million bond was passed in 2023 for new construction and renovation of the high school complex.

===Junior college===
The Andrews Business and Technology Center was completed in January 2006, in conjunction with Odessa College and the University of Texas of the Permian Basin. The school focuses on technology and is a hub for distance learning. A $1 million expansion of the campus was completed in 2013 adding space for a registered nurse program.

==Parks and recreation==

===Andrews County Veterans Memorial===
The Andrews County Veterans Memorial is a memorial in Andrews that was created in 2006 as a tribute to those Andrews County residents who served in the United States&#x27; armed forces. Soldiers from every major conflict in which America has participated are honored.

===Andrews Bird Viewing Trail===
The Andrews Bird Viewing Trail opened to the public in 2007. The park includes a 0.2-mile trail alongside ponds with an overlook deck, benches, and an observation binocular stand.

===ACE Arena===
To attract events to the community, the county funded and built ACE Arena (a multipurpose arena), which opened in March 2007. A smaller outdoor arena was also constructed in 2012 adjacent to the indoor arena.

===Andrews Splash Park===
The city approved a $2 million water park to replace the former city pool in 2013.

===Legacy Park and Museum===
The city relocated a historic home to property adjacent to the Andrews County Veterans Memorial in 2013, and a plan was approved in 2019 that was to transform the home into a museum. A memorial to first responders and other additions are planned as part of the Legacy Park development.

<text>Burke is a city in southwestern Angelina County, Texas, United States. The population was 691 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Burke was founded in 1881 when construction of the Houston, East and West Texas Railway reached the western edge of Bradley Prairie. The town was originally named Rhodes, for general store owner W. R. Rhodes and postmaster H. R. Rhodes, but &quot;circa&quot; 1885 it was renamed for Edmund L. Burke, a railroad employee who directed the railroad survey.

By 1885 Burke had three sawmills, three cotton gins, a church, and a school. In 1886, it received a post office, which remained there until 1955. By 1888, it had a larger school, three general stores, a drugstore, a sawmill, a dentist and watchmaker, and a Farmers&#x27; Alliance store. In 1897, Burke had an estimated population of 650. By 1904, Burke&#x27;s population had declined to 161, due to the rise of Lufkin, eight miles north, as an industrial center for the county. However, by 1915 the population had risen to 200, and by 1925 it reached 300. The Burke Methodist Church was organized in 1899–1900, and the First Baptist Church of Burke in 1905.

Education was a priority at Burke. The first school, a one-room structure, was enlarged to three rooms within a few years. Voters approved a bond in 1910 to erect a brick schoolhouse for grades one through seven. The brick building was torn down in 1935 and replaced with a larger schoolhouse built with WPA funds.

<text>Lufkin is the largest city in Angelina County, Texas, United States and is the county seat. The city is situated in Deep East Texas and is west of the Texas- Louisiana state line. Its population is 34,143 as of 2020.

Lufkin was founded in 1884 and named for Abraham P. Lufkin. It originally served as a stop on the Houston, East and West Texas Railway. It was officially incorporated on October 15, 1890. Lufkin continued to serve as a stop on the railroad until 1890. Three businessmen founded Angelina Lumber Company, which led to much of the economic prosperity Lufkin later enjoyed. When the so-called &quot;timber boom&quot; came to an end, a new &quot;golden era of expansion&quot; began. Lufkin became more industrialized with the opening of Lufkin Industries and Southland Paper Mill. In the mid-1960s, a cultural expansion began, and improvements were made to education and the way of life, including museums and the opening of a new library.

The City of Lufkin has a council–manager government, with six city council members, a mayor, and a city manager. The Lufkin Independent School District encompasses most of Lufkin and operates almost all of the schools within Lufkin. Additionally, Angelina College, a community college, is located in Lufkin.

==History==
The city was originally founded in 1882 as a stop on the Houston, East and West Texas Railway; it is named for Abraham P. Lufkin, a cotton merchant and Galveston city councilman. Lufkin was the father-in-law of Paul Bremond, president of the railroad, which developed the town. Lufkin continued to grow because of its proximity to the railroad and its lumber industry. The history of Lufkin can be divided into three main eras, the railroad era, the timber boom, and the golden era of expansion.

===Railroad era===
The railroad era lasted between 1882 and 1890. In 1881, the area that is now Lufkin was little more than a small settlement known as Denman Springs. A railroad surveying team began to plan a route through Angelina County, with a possible route through Homer, Texas, which at the time was the county seat. According to legend, the men in the surveying team began to get rowdy in the saloon in Homer, which led to their arrest. They paid their way out the next morning, but this infuriated the chief surveyor. He ordered the team for the rail line to bypass Homer and go by Denman Springs. Conveniently, the new route went through the property of Lafayette Denman and his son, Dr. A. M. Denman, who as the legend goes, had hosted the surveying team a few days earlier. This legend is most likely not true since the prospectus in 1879 already had the railroad planned to bypass Homer and go through the future site of Lufkin.

The railroad officially arrived in 1882, and the company began to advertise the sale of lots of land in Lufkin. During this time, many of the businesses and professionals from Homer began to relocate to Lufkin to be closer to the railroad. Some of the first stores in Lufkin included S. Abram&#x27;s general store, Joseph Kerr&#x27;s grocery and saddle shop, and W. H. Bonner&#x27;s general store, all located on Cotton Square, which became the center of most economic activity in Lufkin. Behind the depot, which was on the cotton square, cotton was stored before being shipped on the railroad. The town continued to grow, and acquired a post office in 1882 with William A. Abney as postmaster. Soon after in 1883, a telegraph line was strung connecting Lufkin to Nacogdoches by telegraph. On October 15, 1890, the town was officially incorporated. The first mayor of Lufkin was J. M. Smith, who was the owner of Smith Hotel; he was elected on November 15, 1890. Even before the incorporation of Lufkin, the courthouse was sought to have been moved. By a vote in 1885, though, the courthouse remained in Homer. In November 1891, a fire of mysterious origin destroyed the courthouse in Homer. This prompted a petition from the citizens of Lufkin asking for a new election to be held to decide if the courthouse should be relocated to Lufkin. The election was held on January 2, 1892, and the citizens decided to relocate the courthouse to Lufkin.

===Timber boom===

The timber boom lasted between 1890 and 1920. Three main lumbering families are recognized for much of the economic prosperity in Lufkin the Kurths, the Hendersons, and the Wieners. Joseph H. Kurth Sr., was a German immigrant, who had operated a sawmill in Polk County, Texas. He moved to a small settlement north of Lufkin known as Keltys. In 1887, Kurth obtained a sawmill from Charles L. Kelty. He was soon joined by S. W. Henderson Sr., and Sam Wiener, both of Corrigan, Texas. In 1890, the men started the Angelina County Lumber Company. The company became the forerunner of the lumber industry in East Texas, and led to much of the economic prosperity in Lufkin. At the peak of the three families&#x27; activities, nearly a dozen sawmills and several other industries were operating.

===Golden era of expansion===
The golden era of expansion occurred between 1938 and 1945. In the late 1930s, two of the principal industries in Lufkin, the Southland Paper Mill, later known as Abitibi Bowater Inc. which closed in 2007, and Texas Foundries opened. These companies provided much of Lufkin&#x27;s industrial growth. The largest industrial employer was Lufkin Foundry and Machine Company, later known as Lufkin Industries; it ceased operations in 2018.

===Cultural expansion===
In early Lufkin history, most daily life revolved around churches, schools, and sports activities, but this began to change between 1965 and 1983, when Lufkin began a cultural expansion. Improvements included the Kurth Memorial Library, new museums, a civic center, Angelina College, a new federal building, a country club, municipal and city parks, two shopping malls, and the Lufkin Independent School District. Lufkin celebrated its centennial in 1982.

===Recent history===
Debris from the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster fell over the Lufkin area on February 1, 2003.

===Climate===
Lufkin is a humid subtropical climate that generally has relatively high temperatures with evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. Generally, this climate is seen on the eastern side continents between 20 and 35°N or S latitude. During summer, these regions over low-latitude ocean waters are generally under the influence of hot, maritime overflow from the western side of subtropical anticyclonic cells. These higher temperatures can lead to warm, oppressive nights. Due to an increase in thunderstorms, summers in Lufkin are usually wetter than winters. Additionally, tropical cyclones can increase precipitation during the summer. Cold months are usually mild and frost is uncommon.

<text>Fulton is a town in Aransas County, Texas, United States. As of the 2020 census, this South Texas coastal fishing community had a population of 1,523. The town is named for George Ware Fulton, a land developer in the area.

==History==
Fulton was founded in 1866, and named by George Ware Fulton, Sr., whose wife Harriet Smith Fulton inherited on the northern end of the Live Oak Peninsula, including the area where Mr. Fulton created the town he named for himself. Fulton had been a teacher in Indiana and decided to come to Texas by flatboat with 60 other men during the war for independence between Texas and Mexico. After the long trip to Texas, George Fulton found that the war was over but he joined the Army of the Republic of Texas for a few months. He worked for Henry Smith, the first Governor of Texas, and married Smith&#x27;s daughter, Harriet. They raised a family and moved around the country as George found jobs supervising railroads and building bridges. When Harriet inherited 48,000 acres of the Texas coast, they moved back to live on the Live Oak Peninsula.

After ten years, the Fultons built a large house, now known as the Fulton Mansion, just south of the town. The Fulton&#x27;s owned thousands of cattle wandering on their extensive lands, and formed a cattle company with others. Mr. Fulton built slaughterhouses and patented a chilled slaughterhouse, the first in the world. The town quickly became the site for many slaughterhouses as cattle from south Texas were driven to Fulton. The cattle slaughterhouses lasted until the 1880s when railroads reached the area and provided ways to ship live cattle to population centers such as Chicago.

In 1930, some evidence of a prehistoric settlement was found in the Fulton area, possibly Karankawan.

On August 25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall near Fulton at category 4 intensity.

<text>Rockport is a city and county seat of Aransas County, Texas, United States. The population was 10,070 at the 2020 census.

Rockport is adjacent to the town of Fulton, and many refer to the combined communities as &quot;Rockport-Fulton&quot;; however, Rockport and Fulton are legally separate municipalities.

==History==
===19th Century===
Following the Civil War, a number of people considered developing the Live Oak Peninsula. Joseph F. Smith, who had founded the nearby town of St. Mary&#x27;s in 1850, joined with Thomas H. Mathis and his cousin J.M. Mathis, who were agents of the Morgan Steamship line, and built a wharf at the site of what would later become the town of Rockport, in 1867. The same year, George W. Fulton and his wife, Texas heiress, and Joseph Smith&#x27;s cousin, Harriet Smith Fulton moved to her extensive land holdings on the peninsula. Fulton also took an interest in the development of Rockport, as well as creating the town of Fulton farther up the coastline. In response, a nascent cattle-slaughtering and packing operation at the wharf expanded rapidly, allowing Rockport to be officially incorporated as a town in 1870; its name arising from the rock ledge that runs along the shore. Thomas Mathis became Rockport&#x27;s first mayor after being appointed by the governor. A year later in 1871, the town achieved &quot;city&quot; status after continued growth.

In 1871, the Mathis cousins teamed up with local ranching families of George W. Fulton and Thomas M. Coleman to raise and slaughter cattle for shipment out of the city&#x27;s wharf on their steamship line. The partnership proved highly successful and continued to draw people and businesses to the city. The national Panic of 1873 took its share of the town&#x27;s prosperity and caused a slump for the next few years. The meatpacking market was slow to recover, and the Mathis cousins abandoned the ranching partnership in 1879. Fulton and Coleman then re-formed their ranching partnership, an organization that continued into the 1930s. For many years Fulton and others petitioned for the railroad to extend their lines to Rockport to provide a second source of transportation and break the Morgan Line&#x27;s monopoly on the Coastal Bend ports. After offering free rights of way across the Coleman-Fulton ranch, and hundreds of acres in town lots, finally, in 1888 the railroad arrived. The Morgan Steamship company now had competition, and as the local cattle ranchers began shipping live cattle by train, The Morgan Line withdrew from serving the Coastal Bend. Another brief growth spurt began and soon ended, here and across Texas, due to some bad winters and the development of the cattle industry in the mid-west. The railroad, however, brought tourists, and the city&#x27;s economy grew with several large hotels catering to that industry. Rockport&#x27;s economy soon came to be dominated by shipbuilding and tourism toward the end of the 19th century. At the same time, the railroad offered speedy transportation for crops, and a land boom caused by farming followed until brought to a halt with the national Panic of 1893.

===20th Century===
Rockport&#x27;s economy continued struggling into the early 20th century and took another hit in 1919 when a major hurricane decimated the region. A slow recovery ensued stalling additional development. The city&#x27;s fortunes however began to improve in 1925 following the establishment of a lucrative shrimping industry which grew further during the 1930s and benefited from the construction of a harbor in 1935. Shrimping activity decreased during World War II but recovered thereafter, boosting the town along with an important boat-building industry that developed in this period as well. By the century&#x27;s end, shrimping continued to be an important part of the Rockport economy alongside fishing and tourism.

===21st Century===
On August 25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey &quot;(name now retired)&quot; made landfall near the city as a Category 4 storm on the Saffir–Simpson scale. Harvey caused one death and catastrophic damage. One person died in a house fire in the city, unable to be rescued due to the extreme weather conditions, entire blocks were destroyed by the hurricane&#x27;s violent eyewall winds, the city&#x27;s courthouse was severely damaged when a cargo trailer was hurled into it, coming to a stop halfway through the structure, the gymnasium of the Rockport-Fulton High School lost multiple walls while the school itself suffered considerable damage, many homes, apartment buildings, and businesses sustained major structural damage from the intense winds, and several were completely destroyed. Numerous boats were damaged or sunk at a marina in town, airplanes and structures were destroyed at the Aransas County Airport, and the Fairfield Inn was severely damaged as well, About 20 percent of Rockport&#x27;s population was displaced, as they were still unable to return to their homes a year after the hurricane.

There is also a large ski basin called Little Bay that provides an area for water skiing, boating, and jet skiing.

===The Big Blue Crab===
The Big Blue Crab is a local park and attraction located on the banks of Little Bay next to the historic Sea View Motel. It features an elevated blue crab sculpture that is the world&#x27;s largest. Originally constructed in the 1950s, the crab fell apart in the 1970s, but the city rebuilt the attraction in 2012 to even larger proportions. The crab suffered major damage five years later in Hurricane Harvey. As the community got well on its way to restoring and cleaning up the damage left from the storm a group was formed and begin plans to have a new Crab Built and set in the place of the old one. The new Crab would need to be built to be able to withstand not only the ravages of time but also to sustain any future storms that may impact the area. Proposals for artists were sent out and a renowned artist named Joe Barrington was selected for the project. The crab arrived in Aransas County on Tuesday, July 27 and installation began July 28th, 2021.

===Birdwatching===
The area around and in Rockport is noted as a prime birdwatching center, located on a major North American migratory bird route, the Central Flyway.

<doc id="135445" wikidata="Q972839" url="?curid=135445" title="Megargel, Texas">
<text>Megargel ( ) is a town in Archer County, Texas, United States. It is part of the Wichita Falls, Texas metropolitan statistical area. Its population was 174 at the 2020 census. The town is named for Roy C. Megargel, the president of the railroad that developed the town.

==History==
Megargel was established as a result of the Gulf, Texas and Western Railroad extending services to Jacksboro and Seymour. The town was established in 1910. The community developed multiple businesses within three months because the purchasers of land who established businesses 60 days after acquiring their lots received discounts as an incentive to do so.

The town had 350 residents in 1914. By 1923, the population had increased to 475. Around that time, H. Sheets drilled a new oil well in the Swastika oilfield, causing a population increase. Oil was discovered east of Megargel in 1925, and the town expanded even more. One year later, the town had 1,000 residents, and in 1927, it increased by 200 more people. About 1,200 people lived in Megargel in 1927, but the population began a decline after that point. The railroad stopped operations in 1943. The number of residents was 347 by 1950, 244 in 1990, 248 in 2000, and 203 in 2010.

In 2014, 130 water meters out of the 200 in Megargel were active, and many houses were unoccupied. That year, Bill Hanna of the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; stated that downtown Megargel was &quot;virtually empty, littered with crumbling and abandoned buildings and outdated gas stations.&quot; Hanna stated that some Megargel residents believed that the demise of the Megargel Independent School District was a factor in recent population declines.

==Geography==

==Education==
Megargel is served by the Olney Independent School District.

Megargel was once served by the Megargel Independent School District. By 2006, the school (along with the town) had been declining for years, and was running out of funds. The school board has voted to consolidate with Olney ISD, the neighboring school district in Olney, Texas (about 12 miles southeast), subject to voter approval on May 13, 2006. Proponents argued that the school (which had only 63 students, including only one in seventh grade) simply cannot continue to function, and consolidation with the neighboring district (which had nearly 800 students) would provide more opportunities for educational achievement. Opponents feared that closure of the school would cause the town to disappear. The vote was in favor of consolidation. The school and district closed after the school year ended.

The designated community college for Archer County is Vernon Regional Junior College.

==Government and infrastructure==
The community post office had opened within three months of Megargel&#x27;s establishment. The United States Postal Service continues to operate the Megargel Post Office.

==Economy==
Megargel had a hotel, a bank, and 23 stores within three months of its founding. By 1986, Megargel had nine businesses.

==Media==
The community previously had a newspaper, &quot;Megargel Times&quot;, established by 1914.

Claude was originally named Armstrong City after several area ranches named Armstrong.

The town name became Claude in 1887, named for Claude Ayers. He was the engineer of the first train of the Fort Worth and Denver Railway to travel through the area.

When Armstrong County was formed in 1890, Claude and Washburn competed to be the county seat. The tie-breaking vote for Claude was reportedly cast by legendary cattleman Charles Goodnight, former co-owner of the nearby JA Ranch. The Armstrong County Courthouse in Claude dates to 1912.

W.S. Decker established a weekly newspaper, &quot;The Claude Argus&quot;, which later merged with the &quot;Goodnight News&quot; to become &quot;The Claude News&quot; in 1890.

The Armstrong County Museum has local and Western-themed exhibits. The film &quot;Hud&quot;, starring Paul Newman and Patricia Neal, was filmed there in 1962.

==Etymology==

In October 1910, the town of &quot;New Artesia&quot; was to be incorporated. When the papers were presented in Austin, the men who took them there were told that they would have to change the name since there was already a town in West Texas with that name. The men returned home, called a town meeting and asked for suggestions. Not having any luck, the city council members finally authorized their wives to choose a suitable name. The ladies renamed New Artesia &quot;Christine&quot; after Christine Andrews, the first baby girl born in the town. She was the daughter of City Marshal James Andrews and wife, Rieta.

<text>San Felipe ( ), also known as San Felipe de Austin, is a town in Austin County, Texas, United States. The town was the social, economic, and political center of the early Stephen F. Austin colony. The population was 691 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1823, John McFarland operated a ferry on the Brazos River near this location. In the fall of the same year, the site was chosen by Stephen F. Austin, with the help of Felipe Enrique Neri, Baron de Bastrop, to be the main site in Texas for American colonization. Founded in 1824 as San Felipe de Austin, the town served as the capital of Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s first colony and the founding site of the Texas Rangers.

By 1828, San Felipe had been surveyed, with &quot;Calle Commercio&quot; laid out as the main commercial street. Austin and his secretary, Samuel May Williams, both resided in log cabins on the square. There were about 30 buildings, and at least one of these was a wood-framed structure. Also on the square was the tavern of Jonathan Peyton. Starting in 1830, James (Jack) Cummins operated a nearby lumber mill and grist mill, and about the same time, settlers raised livestock in the area.

By 1835, the town&#x27;s population had increased to around 600.

It was home to the first post office and one of the earliest newspapers and land offices in Texas. San Felipe was second only to San Antonio as a commercial center of Texas.

The Texas conventions of 1832 and 1833 and the Consultation of November 3, 1835, were held here. San Felipe acted as the capital for the provisional government of Texas until the Convention of 1836. The town was burned in 1836 to prevent the Mexican army from capturing it, and rebuilt a few years later, but never regained its popularity. The oldest post office in Texas is located here (ZIP code 77473).

Local residents dedicated the original townsite as a commemorative site in 1928. In 1940, the town of San Felipe donated most of the original townsite property to the state, which is now the San Felipe de Austin State Historic Site.

<text>Muleshoe is a city in Bailey County, Texas, United States. It was founded in 1913, when the Pecos and Northern Texas Railway built an line from Farwell, Texas, to Lubbock through northern Bailey County. In 1926, Muleshoe was incorporated. Its population was 5,158 at the 2010 census. The county seat of Bailey County, it is home to the National Mule Memorial.

The Muleshoe Heritage Center is commemorates the importance of ranching to West Texas.

==History==
The name Muleshoe can be traced in the region to Henry Black, when he registered a brand on November 12, 1860. In 1877, Black purchased three houses on in Stephens County, naming it Muleshoe Ranch. Later, he built a large ranch house and a log schoolhouse, and established a small cemetery for family members. Muleshoe Ranch was supposedly named after the owner found a mule shoe in the soil.

On April 23, 1906, the Gulf, Santa Fe and Northwestern Railway Company and the Pecos and Northern Texas Railway Company merged (eventual successor BNSF Railway) and were chartered to construct a railway between Lubbock and Farwell on the New Mexico border. From 1901 to 1915, communities along the future railway contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to its construction. Muleshoe was founded in 1913 when the Pecos and Northern Texas Railway laid rails across northern Bailey County; residents borrowed the name from the nearby Muleshoe Ranch.

Soon after the railroad passed through Muleshoe, the town expanded rapidly. In 1917, Muleshoe became the county seat after the county was organized, but it was not incorporated until 1926. Muleshoe continued to grow quickly, and by 1930, 800 residents were in the town. Three decades later, Muleshoe had tripled in population to 3,871. In 1970, Muleshoe reached its pinnacle at over 5,000 residents, 200 businesses, two hospitals, two banks, a library, a newspaper, and a radio station. 

During the 1970s and 1980s the population stagnated, and by the 1990s Muleshoe&#x27;s population had begun to decrease. The population went from 5,048 in 1988 to 4,530 in 2000. The once lively and vibrant Main Street is now quiet, with many abandoned buildings. Many of the businesses that once called Main Street home are now on American Boulevard (US Highway 84/70).

During the early 1960s, Texas residents were eager to build a memorial to the mule for its strength and sparse eating habits, traits that endeared it to the pioneers. In war, the mule carried cannon; in peace, it hauled freight. Its small hooves allowed it to scale rocky areas. The Mule Memorial was first displayed on July 4, 1965, near the intersection of US 70/84. Muleshoe is the home of the world&#x27;s largest mule shoe, at the Muleshoe Heritage Center.

In January 2024, a Russian hacktivist group hacked the town&#x27;s water supply, causing flooding.

Bandera was a staging area on the Great Western Cattle Trail, during the second half of the 19th century.

The Cabaret Dance Hall opened in 1936. Throughout its history the dance hall hosted Bob Wills, Doug Sahm, Ernest Tubb, and others. In 2008, the hall was listed as endangered by Preservation Texas. By at least 2013 the hall was closed. By at least 2015 the hall was demolished.

<doc id="135459" wikidata="Q981557" url="?curid=135459" title="Lakehills, Texas">
<text>Lakehills is a census-designated place (CDP) in Bandera County, Texas, United States. The population was 5,295 at the 2020 census, making it the most populous place in Bandera County. It is part of the San Antonio Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Lakehills was originally known as Upper Medina Lake, until a post office substation was established in the area in the early 1960s. Two toll roads served the area until the late 1940s–early 1950s.

As the town is on Medina Lake, its prosperity is tied to that of the lake. During the 2010–13 Southern United States drought, lake levels dropped to below 5% capacity and Lakehills was described as a ghost town. Heavy rainfalls throughout 2015 and 2016 brought Medina Lake back up to 100% and remained at or near full capacity for the next few years; however, the last time the lake was recorded at full capacity was on July 7, 2019. Due to a series of severe droughts throughout the early 2020s, lake levels once again plummeted with the capacity dropping down to 2.4% in June 2024. As a result, Lakehills and the surrounding areas have experienced economic hardships due to a decrease in tourism along with a decrease in home values and a rise in homelessness.

<text>Bastrop () is a city and the county seat of Bastrop County, Texas, United States. The population was 9,688 according to the 2020 census. It is located about southeast of Austin and is part of the Greater Austin metropolitan area.

==History==

Spanish soldiers lived temporarily at the current site of Bastrop as early as 1804, when a fort was established where the Old San Antonio Road crossed the Colorado River and named &quot;Puesta del Colorado&quot;.

Bastrop&#x27;s namesake, Felipe Enrique Neri, Baron de Bastrop, was a commoner named Philip Hendrik Nering Bogel, who was wanted for embezzlement in his native country of the Netherlands. In Texas, he assisted Moses and Stephen F. Austin in obtaining land grants in Texas and served as Austin&#x27;s land commissioner. In 1827, Austin located about 100 families in an area adjacent to his earlier Mexican contracts. Austin arranged for Mexican officials to name a new town there after the baron who died the same year.

On June 8, 1832, the town was platted along conventional Mexican lines, with a square in the center and blocks set aside for public buildings. The town was named Bastrop, but two years later, the Coahuila y Tejas legislature renamed it Mina in honor of Francisco Javier Mina, a Mexican revolutionary hero and martyr. The town was incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Texas on December 18, 1837, and the name was changed back to Bastrop.

Overlooking the center of the town is the Lost Pines Forest. Composed of loblolly pines (&quot;Pinus taeda&quot;), the forest is the center of the westernmost stand of the southern pine forest. As the only timber available in the area, the forest contributed to the local economy. Bastrop began supplying Austin with lumber in 1839 and then San Antonio, the western Texas frontier, and parts of Mexico.

A fire in 1862 destroyed most of downtown Bastrop&#x27;s commercial buildings and the county courthouse. As a result, most current downtown structures postdate the Civil War. In 1979, the National Register of Historic Places admitted 131 Bastrop buildings and sites to its listings. This earned Bastrop the title of the &quot;Most Historic Small Town in Texas&quot;.

The first edition of the &quot;Bastrop Advertiser and County News&quot; (now &quot;The Bastrop Advertiser&quot;) was published on March 1, 1853, giving it claim to be the oldest continuously published weekly (semiweekly since September 5, 1977) in Texas. The wider Bastrop County is also covered by papers such as the &quot;Elgin Courier&quot;.

On September 4, 2011, two wildfires started when trees fell on power lines. The first fire started in the community of Circle D-KC Estates near Bastrop State Park, and the other fire started about north. The two fires merged into the Bastrop County Complex fire. This was the worst and most destructive wildfire in Texas history, as it destroyed 1,691 homes, killed two people, and caused $325 million of insured property damage. The drought in Texas at the time combined with strong winds from the Gulf of Mexico caused by Tropical Storm Lee helped fuel the fire.

==Geography==
Bastrop is located near the center of Bastrop County along the lower Colorado River. The downtown business district of the city is located on a bluff on the east bank of the river, but the city extends to the west side of the river, as well. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.23%, is covered by water.

Three miles (5 km) northeast of the town, Lake Bastrop is a reservoir on Spicer Creek operated by the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) since its impounding in 1964. Although primarily used as a cooling pond for the Sim Gideon Power Plant, the lake is also used for recreation, and the LCRA maintains two public parks on the lake.

<text>Camp Swift is a census-designated place (CDP) in Bastrop County, Texas, United States. The population was 7,943 at the 2020 census. Camp Swift began as a United States Army training base built in 1942. It is named after Major General Eben Swift.

==History==
The Army signed a $25 million contract in January 1942 to build a training camp on 56,000 acres north of Bastrop, Texas. The contract stipulated the project was to be completed in 108 working days. Twenty-seven hundred buildings were built during World War II, but none of those remain on the site today. At the end of the war, they were sold or donated and relocated. The gymnasium was relocated to Whitney, Texas. It is still in use today by the school district.

During World War II, German prisoners of war began arriving and at peak numbered 10,000. At the same time, the camp held 90,000 GIs, making it &quot;one of the largest army training and transshipment camps in Texas&quot; according to Krammer.

In December 1942, Sgt Walter Springs was gunned down by a White military police officer following a dispute as Springs was reporting to Camp Swift. Springs was shot in the back, but the case remains largely unsolved to this day. A memorial scholarship in his honor has been active at his alma mater, Regis University, for most of the period since 1952 and has the backing of former NBA All Star Chauncey Billups.

The 10th Mountain Division trained at Camp Swift in 1944. The 2nd Infantry Division trained there mid 1945 to early 1946. The camp also trained nurses under battlefield conditions. The camp trained some 300,000 soldiers before the war ended.

After World War II, most of the land was returned to its former owners. The U.S. government retained 11,700 acres as a military reservation as well as a smaller parcel for FCI Bastrop.

The Texas Wing of the Civil Air Patrol, the Auxiliary of the Air Force has held its encampment, a one-week high intensity simulated military training program for Cadet (leaders in training) members in Camp Swift since 2011.
==Current Operations==

Camp Swift is currently owned by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, but is managed by the Texas Military Forces headquartered on Camp Mabry in Austin and acts as a training center for the National and State Guard, active armed forces, law enforcement, JROTC and the Civil Air Patrol. The camp is also the primary emergency staging area for Central Texas. Camp Swift is also the primary site for pre-mobilization training for the Texas Army National Guard.

Beginning in 2007, Camp Swift became home to the 136th Combat Arms Training Regiment and Texas National Guard Training Center of Excellence. The 136th Regiment conducts military occupational specialty qualification courses, Noncommissioned Officer Education System courses, Officer Candidate School, Warrant Officer Candidate School, and other specialty courses. 

Camp Swift has educational facilities and classrooms, a gas chamber, an airborne drop zone, rifle and pistol ranges, helicopter landing sites and a land navigation course.
