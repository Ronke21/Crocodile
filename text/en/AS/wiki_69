<text>Jesse Alexander Helms Jr. (October 18, 1921 – July 4, 2008) was an American politician. A leader in the conservative movement, he served as a senator from North Carolina from 1973 to 2003. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 1995 to 2001, he had a major voice in foreign policy. Helms helped organize and fund the conservative resurgence in the 1970s, focusing on Ronald Reagan&#x27;s quest for the White House as well as helping many local and regional candidates.

On domestic social issues, Helms opposed civil rights, disability rights, environmentalism, feminism, gay rights, affirmative action, access to abortions, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the National Endowment for the Arts. He brought an &quot;aggressiveness&quot; to his conservatism, as in his rhetoric against homosexuality. &quot;The Almanac of American Politics&quot; wrote that &quot;no American politician is more controversial, beloved in some quarters and hated in others, than Jesse Helms&quot;.

As chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he demanded an anti-communist foreign policy. His relations with the State Department were often acrimonious, and he blocked numerous presidential appointees.

Helms was the longest-serving popularly elected senator in North Carolina&#x27;s history. He was widely credited with shifting the one-party state into a competitive two-party state. He advocated the movement of conservatives from the Democratic Party – which he deemed too liberal – to the Republican Party. The Helms-controlled National Congressional Club&#x27;s state-of-the-art direct mail operation raised millions of dollars for Helms and other conservative candidates, allowing Helms to outspend his opponents in most of his campaigns. Helms was considered the most stridently conservative American politician of the post-1960s era, especially in opposition to federal intervention into what he considered state affairs (including legislating integration via the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and enforcing suffrage through the Voting Rights Act of 1965).

==Childhood and education (1921–1940)==

Helms was born in 1921 in Monroe, North Carolina, where his father, nicknamed &quot;Big Jesse&quot;, served as both fire chief and chief of police; his mother, Ethel Mae Helms, was a homemaker. Helms was of English ancestry on both sides. Helms described Monroe as a community surrounded by farmland and with a population of about three thousand where &quot;you knew just about everybody and just about everybody knew you.&quot; The Helms family was poor during the Great Depression, resulting in each of the children working from an early age. Helms acquired his first job sweeping floors at &quot;The Monroe Enquirer&quot; at age nine. The family attended services each Sunday at First Baptist, Helms later saying he would never forget being served chickens raised in the family&#x27;s backyard by his mother, following their weekly services. He recalled initially being bothered by their chickens becoming their food, but abandoned this view to allow himself to concentrate on his mother&#x27;s cooking. Helms recalled that his family rarely spoke about politics, reasoning that the political climate did not call for discussions as most of the people the family were acquainted with were members of the Democratic Party.

Link described Helms&#x27;s father as having a domineering influence on the child&#x27;s development, describing the pair as being similar in having the traits of being extrovert, effusive, and enjoying the company of others while both favored constancy, loyalty, and respect for order. The elder Helms asserted to his son that ambition was good and accomplishments and achievements would come his way through following a strict work ethic. Years later, Helms retained fond memories of his father&#x27;s involvement with his youth: &quot;I shall forever have wonderful memories of a caring, loving father who took the time to listen and to explain things to his wide-eyed son.&quot; In high school, Helms was voted &quot;Most Obnoxious&quot; in his senior yearbook.

Helms briefly attended Wingate Junior College, now Wingate University, near Monroe, before leaving for Wake Forest College. He left Wingate after a year to begin a career as a journalist, working for the next eleven years as a newspaper and radio reporter, first as a sportswriter and news reporter for Raleigh&#x27;s &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot;, and also as assistant city editor for &quot;The Raleigh Times&quot;. Helms retained a positive view of Wingate into his later years, saying the school was filled with individuals that treated him with kindness and that he had made it an objective to repay the institution for what it had done for him. While attending Wake Forest, Helms left work early and ran a few blocks to catch a train every morning to ensure he was on time to his classes. Helms stated that his goal in attending was never to get a diploma but instead form the skills needed for forms of employment he was seeking at a time when he aspired to become a journalist.

==Marriage and family==
Helms met Dorothy &quot;Dot&quot; Coble, editor of the society page at &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot;, and they married in 1942. Helms&#x27;s first interest in politics came from conversations with his conservative father-in-law. In 1945, his and Dot&#x27;s first child Jane was born.

==Early career (1940–1972)==
Helms&#x27;s first full-time job after college was as a sports reporter with the &quot;Raleigh Times&quot;. During World War II, Helms served stateside as a recruiter in the United States Navy.

After the war, he pursued his twin interests of journalism and Democratic Party politics. Helms became the city news editor of the &quot;Raleigh Times.&quot; He later became a radio and television newscaster and commentator for &quot;WRAL-TV&quot;, where he hired Armistead Maupin as a reporter.

===Entry into politics===
In 1950, Helms played a critical role as campaign publicity director for Willis Smith in the U.S. Senate campaign against a prominent liberal, Frank Porter Graham. Smith (a conservative Democratic lawyer and former president of the American Bar Association) portrayed Graham, who supported school desegregation, as a &quot;dupe of communists&quot; and a proponent of the &quot;mingling of the races&quot;. Smith&#x27;s fliers said, &quot;Wake Up, White People&quot;, in the campaign for the virtually all-white primaries. Blacks were still mostly disfranchised in the state, because its 1900 constitutional amendment had been passed by white Democrats with restrictive voter registration and electoral provisions that effectively and severely reduced their role in electoral politics.

Smith won and hired Helms as his administrative assistant in Washington. In 1952, Helms worked on the presidential campaign of Georgia Senator Richard Russell Jr. After Russell dropped out of the presidential race, Helms returned to working for Smith. When Smith died in 1953, Helms returned to Raleigh.

From 1953 to 1960, Helms was executive director of the North Carolina Bankers Association. He and his wife set up their home on Caswell Street in the Hayes Barton Historic District, where he lived the rest of his life.

In 1957, Helms as a Democrat won his first election for a Raleigh City Council seat. He served two terms and earned a reputation as a conservative gadfly who &quot;fought against everything from putting a median strip on Downtown Boulevard to an urban renewal project&quot;. Helms disliked his tenure on the council, feeling all the other members acted as a private club and that Mayor William G. Enloe was a &quot;steamroller&quot;. In 1960, Helms worked on the unsuccessful primary gubernatorial campaign of I. Beverly Lake Sr., who ran on a platform of racial segregation. Lake lost to future Senator Terry Sanford, who ran as a racial moderate willing to implement the federal policy of school integration. Helms felt forced busing and forced racial integration caused animosity on both sides and &quot;proved to be unwise&quot;.

===Capitol Broadcasting Company===
In 1960, Helms joined the Raleigh-based Capitol Broadcasting Company (CBC) as the executive vice-president, vice chairman of the board, and assistant chief executive officer. His daily CBC editorials on WRAL-TV, given at the end of each night&#x27;s local news broadcast in Raleigh, made Helms famous as a conservative commentator throughout eastern North Carolina.

Helms&#x27;s editorials featured folksy anecdotes interwoven with conservative views against &quot;the civil rights movement, the liberal news media, and anti-war churches&quot;, among many targets. He referred to &quot;The News and Observer&quot;, his former employer, as the &quot;Nuisance and Disturber&quot; for its promotion of liberal views and support for African-American civil rights activities. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which had a reputation for liberalism, was also a frequent target of Helms&#x27;s criticism. He is said to have referred to the university as &quot;The University of Negroes and Communists&quot; despite a lack of evidence, and suggested a wall be erected around the campus to prevent the university&#x27;s liberal views from &quot;infecting&quot; the rest of the state. Helms said the civil rights movement was infested by Communists and &quot;moral degenerates&quot;. He described the federal program of Medicaid as a &quot;step over into the swampy field of socialized medicine&quot;.

Commenting on the 1963 protests and March on Washington during the Civil Rights Movement, Helms stated, &quot;The negro cannot count forever on the kind of restraint that&#x27;s thus far left him free to clog the streets, disrupt traffic, and interfere with other men&#x27;s rights.&quot; He later wrote, &quot;Crime rates and irresponsibility among Negroes are facts of life which must be faced.&quot;

He was at Capitol Broadcasting Company until he filed for the Senate race in 1972.

===Senate campaign of 1972===
Helms announced his candidacy for a seat in the United States Senate in 1972. His Republican primary campaign was managed by Thomas F. Ellis, who would later be instrumental in Ronald Reagan&#x27;s 1976 campaign and also become the chair of the National Congressional Club. Helms took the Republican primary, winning 92,496 votes, or 60.1%, in a three-candidate field. Meanwhile, Democrats retired the ailing Senator B. Everett Jordan, who lost his primary to Congressman Nick Galifianakis. The latter represented the &quot;new politics&quot; of voters who included the young, African Americans voting since federal legislation removed discriminatory restrictions, and anti-establishment activists, who were based in and around the urban Research Triangle and Piedmont Triad. Although Galifianakis was a &quot;liberal&quot; by North Carolina standards, he opposed busing to achieve integration in schools.

Polls put Galifianakis well ahead until late in the campaign, but Helms, facing all but certain defeat, hired a professional campaign manager, F. Clifton White, giving him dictatorial control over campaign strategy. While Galifianakis avoided mention of his party&#x27;s presidential candidate, the liberal George McGovern, Helms employed the slogans &quot;McGovernGalifianakis – one and the same&quot;, &quot;Vote for Jesse. Nixon Needs Him&quot; and &quot;Jesse: He&#x27;s One of Us&quot;, an implicit play suggesting his opponent&#x27;s Greek heritage made him somehow less &quot;American&quot;. Helms won the support of numerous Democrats, especially in the conservative eastern part of the state. Galifianakis tried to woo Republicans by noting that Helms had earlier criticized Nixon as being too left-wing.

In a taste of things to come, money poured into the race. Helms spent a record $654,000, much of it going toward carefully crafted television commercials portraying him as a soft-spoken mainstream conservative. In the final six weeks of the campaign, Helms outspent Galifianakis three-to-one. Though the year was marked by Democratic gains in the Senate, Helms won 54 percent of the vote to Galifianakis&#x27;s 46 percent. He was elected as the first Republican senator from the state since 1903, before senators were directly elected, and when the Republican Party stood for a different tradition. Helms was helped by Richard Nixon&#x27;s gigantic landslide victory in that year&#x27;s presidential election; Nixon carried North Carolina by 40 points.

==First Senate term (1973–1979)==
===Entering the Senate===

Helms quickly became a &quot;star&quot; of the conservative movement, and was particularly vociferous on the issue of abortion. In 1974, in the wake of the US Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, Helms introduced a constitutional amendment that would have prohibited abortion in all circumstances, by conferring due process rights upon every fetus. However, the Senate hearing into the proposed amendments heard that neither Helms&#x27;, nor James L. Buckley&#x27;s similar amendment, would achieve their stated goal, and shelved them for the session. Both Helms and Buckley proposed amendments again in 1975, with Helms&#x27;s amendment allowing states leeway in their implementation of an enshrined constitutional &quot;right to life&quot; from the &quot;moment of fertilization&quot;.

Helms was also a prominent advocate of free enterprise and favored cutting the budget. He was a strong advocate of a global return to the gold standard, which he would push at numerous points throughout his Senate career; in October 1977, Helms proposed a successful amendment that allowed United States citizens to sign contracts linked to gold, overturning a 44-year ban on gold-indexed contracts, reflecting fears of inflation. Helms supported the tobacco industry, which contributed more than 6% of the state&#x27;s GSP until the 1990s (the highest in the country); he argued that federal price support programs should be maintained, as they did not constitute a subsidy but insurance. Helms offered an amendment that would have denied food stamps to strikers when the Senate approved increasing federal contributions to food stamp and school lunch programs in May 1974.

In 1973, the United States Congress passed the Helms Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act. It states that, &quot;no foreign assistance funds may be used to pay for the performance of abortion as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.&quot;

In January 1973, along with Democrats James Abourezk and Floyd Haskell, Helms was one of three senators to vote against the confirmation of Peter J. Brennan as United States Secretary of Labor.

In May 1974, when the Senate approved the establishment of no‐fault automobile insurance plans in every state, it rejected an amendment by Helms exempting states that were opposed to no‐fault insurance.

===Foreign policy===
From the start, Helms identified as a prominent anti-communist. He proposed an act in 1974 that authorized the President to grant honorary citizenship to Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. He remained close to Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s cause, and linked his fight to that of freedom throughout the world. In 1975, as North Vietnamese forces approached Saigon, Helms was foremost among those urging the US to evacuate all Vietnamese demanding this, which he believed could be &quot;two million or more within seven days&quot;. When the Senate Armed Services Committee voted to suppress a report critical of the US&#x27;s strategic position in the arms race, Helms read the entire report out, requiring it to be published in full in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;.

Helms was not at first a strong supporter of Israel; for instance, in 1973 he proposed a resolution demanding Israel return the West Bank to Jordan, and, in 1975, demanding that the Palestinian Arabs receive a &quot;just settlement of their grievances&quot;. In 1977, Helms was the sole senator to vote against prohibiting American companies from joining the Arab League boycott of Israel, but that was primarily because the bill also relaxed discrimination against Communist countries. In 1982, Helms called for the US to break diplomatic relations with Israel during the 1982 Lebanon War. He favored prohibiting foreign aid to countries that had recently detonated nuclear weapons: this was aimed squarely at India, but it also affected Israel should it conduct a nuclear test. He worked to support the supply of arms to the United States&#x27; Arab allies under presidents Carter and Reagan, until his views on Israel shifted significantly in 1984.

Helms and Bob Dole offered an amendment in 1973 that would have delayed cutting off funding for bombing in Cambodia if the President informed Congress that North Vietnam was not making an accounting &quot;to the best of its ability&quot; of US servicemen missing in Southeast Asia. The amendment was defeated by a vote of 56 to 25.

=== Nixon resignation ===
Helms delivered a Senate speech blaming liberal media for distorting Watergate and questioned if President Nixon had a constitutional right to be considered innocent until proven guilty following the April 1973 revelation of details relating to the scandal and Nixon administration aides resigning. He advocated against illegal activities being condoned with concurrent &quot;half-truth and allegations&quot; being reported by the media. Helms had four separate meetings with President Nixon in April and May 1973 where he attempted to cheer up the president and called for the White House to challenge its critics even as fellow Republicans from North Carolina criticized Nixon. Helms opposed the creation of the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Campaign Practices in the summer of 1973, even as it was chaired by fellow North Carolina Senator Sam Ervin, arguing that it was a ploy by Democrats to discredit and oust Nixon.

In August 1974, &quot;Newsweek&quot; published a list by the White House including Helms as one of 36 senators that the administration believed would support President Nixon in the event of his impeachment and being brought to trial by the Senate. The article stated that some supporters were not fully convinced and this would further peril the administration as 34 were needed to prevent conviction. Nixon resigned days later and kept contact with Helms during his post-presidency, calling Helms to either chat or offer advice.

===1976 presidential election===
Helms supported Ronald Reagan for the presidential nomination in 1976, even before Reagan had announced his candidacy. His contribution was crucial in the North Carolina primary victory that paved the way for Reagan&#x27;s presidential election in 1980. The support of Helms, alongside Raleigh-based campaign operative Thomas F. Ellis, was instrumental in Reagan&#x27;s winning the North Carolina primary and later presenting a major challenge to incumbent President Gerald Ford at the 1976 Republican National Convention. According to author Craig Shirley, the two men deserve credit &quot;for breathing life into the dying Reagan campaign&quot;. Going into the primary, Reagan had lost all the primaries, including in New Hampshire, where he had been favored, and was two million dollars in debt, with a growing number of Republican leaders calling for his exit. The Ford campaign was predicting a victory in North Carolina, but assessed Reagan&#x27;s strength in the state simply: Helms&#x27;s support. While Ford had the backing of Governor James Holshouser, the grassroots movement formed in North Carolina by Ellis and backed by Helms delivered an upset victory by 53% to 47%. The momentum generated in North Carolina carried Ronald Reagan to landslide primary wins in Texas, California, and other critical states, evening the contest between Reagan and Ford, and forcing undeclared delegates to choose at the 1976 convention.

Later, Helms was not pleased by the announcement that Reagan, if nominated, would ask the 1976 Republican National Convention to make moderate Pennsylvania Senator Richard Schweiker his running mate for the general election, but kept his objections to himself at the time. According to Helms, after Reagan told him of the decision, Helms noted the hour because, &quot;I wanted to record for posterity the exact time I received the shock of my life.&quot; Helms and Strom Thurmond tried to make Reagan drop Schweiker for a conservative, perhaps either James Buckley or his brother William F. Buckley Jr., and rumors surfaced that Helms might run for vice president himself, but Schweiker was kept. In the end, Reagan lost narrowly to Ford at the convention, while Helms received only token support for the vice presidential nomination, albeit enough to place him second, far behind Ford&#x27;s choice of Bob Dole. The Convention adopted a broadly conservative platform, and the conservative faction came out acting like the winners; except Jesse Helms.

Helms vowed to campaign actively for Ford across the South, regarding the conservative platform adopted at the convention to be a &quot;mandate&quot; on which Ford was pledging to run. However, he targeted Henry Kissinger after the latter issued a statement calling Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn a &quot;threat to world peace&quot;, and Helms demanded that Kissinger embrace the platform or resign immediately. Helms continued to back Reagan, and the two remained close friends and political allies throughout Reagan&#x27;s political career, although sometimes critical of each other. Despite Reagan&#x27;s defeat at the convention, the intervention of Helms and Ellis arguably led to the most important conservative primary victory in the history of the Republican Party. This victory enabled Reagan to contest the 1976 Republican presidential nomination, and to win the next nomination at the 1980 Republican National Convention and ultimately the presidency of the United States.

According to Craig Shirley,
Had Reagan lost North Carolina, despite his public pronouncements, his revolutionary challenge to Ford, along with his political career, would have ended unceremoniously. He would have made a gracious exit speech, cut a deal with the Ford forces to eliminate his campaign debt, made a minor speech at the Kansas City Convention later that year, and returned to his ranch in Santa Barbara. He would probably have only reemerged to make speeches and cut radio commercials to supplement his income. And Reagan would have faded into political oblivion.

===Torrijos–Carter treaties===
Helms was a long-time opponent of transferring possession of the Panama Canal to Panama, calling its construction an &quot;historic American achievement&quot;. He warned that it would fall into the hands of Omar Torrijos&#x27;s &quot;communist friends&quot;. The issue of transfer of the canal was debated in the 1976 presidential race, wherein then-President Ford suspended negotiations over the transfer of sovereignty to assuage conservative opposition. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter reopened negotiations, appointing Sol Linowitz as co-negotiator without Senate confirmation, and Helms and Strom Thurmond led the opposition to the transfer. Helms claimed that Linowitz&#x27;s involvement with Marine Midland constituted a conflict of interests, arguing that it constituted a bailout of American banking interests. He filed two federal suits, demanding prior congressional approval of any treaty and then consent by both houses of Congress. Helms also rallied Reagan, telling him that negotiation over Panama would be a &quot;second Schweiker&quot; as far as his conservative base was concerned.

When Carter announced, on August 10, 1977, the conclusion of the treaties, Helms declared it a constitutional crisis, cited the need for the support of United States&#x27; allies in Latin America, accused the U.S. of submitting to Panamanian blackmail, and complained that the decision threatened national security in the event of war in Europe. Helms threatened to obstruct Senate business, proposing 200 amendments to the revision of the United States criminal code, knowing that most Americans opposed the treaties and would punish congressmen who voted for them if the ratification vote came in the run-up to the election. Helms announced the results of an opinion poll showing 78% public opposition. However, Helms&#x27;s and Thurmond&#x27;s leadership of the opposition made it politically easier for Carter, causing them to be replaced by the soft-spoken Paul Laxalt.

===1978 re-election campaign===
Helms began campaigning for re-election in February 1977, giving himself 15 months by the time of the primaries. While he faced no primary opponent, the Democrats nominated Commissioner of Insurance John Ingram, who came from behind in the first round of the primary to win in the run-off. Ingram was known as an eccentric populist and used low-budget campaigning, just as he had in winning the primary. He campaigned almost exclusively on the issue of insurance rates and against &quot;fat cats and special interests&quot;, in which he included Helms. Helms was one of three senators given a 100% rating by the conservative Americans for Constitutional Action for 1977, and was ranked fourth-most conservative by others. The Democratic National Committee targeted Helms, as did President Carter, who visited North Carolina twice on Ingram&#x27;s behalf.

In June 1978, along with Strom Thurmond, Helms was one of two senators named by an environmental group as part of a congressional &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; that the group believed should be defeated in their re-election efforts due to their stances on environmental issues; membership on the list was based &quot;primarily on 14 Senate and 19 House votes, including amendments to air and water pollution control laws, strip‐mining controls, auto emissions and water projects&quot;.

Over the long campaign, Helms raised $7.5 million, more than twice as much as the second most-expensive nationwide (John Tower&#x27;s in Texas), thanks to Richard Viguerie&#x27;s and Alex Castellanos&#x27;s pioneering direct mail strategies. It was estimated that at least $3 million of Helms&#x27;s contributions were spent on fund-raising. Helms easily outspent Ingram several times over, as the latter spent $150,000. Due to a punctured lumbar disc, Helms was forced to suspend campaigning for six weeks in September and October. In a low-turnout election, Helms received 619,151 votes (54.5 percent) to Ingram&#x27;s 516,663 (45.5 percent). Celebrating his victory, Helms told his supporters that it was a &quot;victory for the conservative and the free enterprise cause throughout America&quot;, adding, &quot;I&#x27;m Senator No and I&#x27;m glad to be here!&quot;

==Second Senate term (1979–1985)==
===New Senate term===
On January 3, 1979, the first day of the new Congress, Helms introduced a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion, on which he led the conservative senators. Senator Helms was one of several Republican senators who in 1981 called into the White House to express his discontent over the nomination of Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor to the US Supreme Court; their opposition hinged over the issue of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s presumed unwillingness to overturn the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; ruling. Helms was also the Senate conservatives&#x27; leader on school prayer. An amendment proposed by Helms allowing voluntary prayer was passed by the Senate, but died in the House committee. To that act, Helms also proposed an amendment banning sex education without written parental consent. In 1979, Helms and Democrat Patrick Leahy supported a federal Taxpayer Bill of Rights.

He joined the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, being one of four men critical of Carter who were new to the committee. Leader of the pro-Taiwan congressional lobby, Helms demanded that the People&#x27;s Republic of China reject the use of force against the Republic of China, but, much to his shock, the Carter administration did not ask them to rule it out.

Helms also criticized the government over Zimbabwe Rhodesia, leading support for the Internal Settlement government under Abel Muzorewa, and campaigned along with Samuel Hayakawa for the immediate lifting of sanctions on Muzorewa&#x27;s government. Helms complained that it was inconsistent to lift sanctions on Uganda immediately after Idi Amin&#x27;s departure, but not Zimbabwe Rhodesia after Ian Smith&#x27;s. Helms hosted Muzorewa when he visited Washington and met with Carter in July 1979. He sent two aides to the Lancaster House Conference because he did not &quot;trust the State Department on this issue&quot;, thereby provoking British diplomatic complaints. His aide John Carbaugh was accused of encouraging Smith to &quot;hang on&quot; and take a harder line, implying that there was enough support in the US Senate to lift sanctions without a settlement. Helms introduced legislation that demanded immediate lifting of the sanctions; as negotiations progressed, Helms complied more with the administration&#x27;s line, although Senator Ted Kennedy accused Carter of conceding the construction of a new aircraft carrier in return for Helms&#x27;s acquiescence on Zimbabwe Rhodesia, which both parties denied. Helms&#x27;s support for lifting sanctions on Zimbabwe Rhodesia may have been grounded in North Carolina&#x27;s tobacco traders, who would have been the main group benefiting from unilaterally lifting sanctions on tobacco-exporting Zimbabwe Rhodesia.

===1980 presidential election===
In 1979, Helms was touted as a potential contender for the Republican nomination for the 1980 presidential election, but had poor voter recognition, and he lagged far behind the front-runners. He was the only candidate to file for the New Hampshire Vice-Presidential primary. Going into 1980, he was suggested as a potential running mate for Reagan, and said he&#x27;d accept if he could &quot;be his own man&quot;. He was one of three conservative candidates running for the nomination. However, his ideological agreement with Reagan risked losing moderates&#x27; votes, particularly due to the independent candidacy of Rep. John B. Anderson, and the Reagan camp was split: eventually designating George H. W. Bush as his preferred candidate. At the convention, Helms toyed with the idea of running for vice-president despite Reagan&#x27;s choice, but let it go in exchange for Bush&#x27;s endorsing the party platform and allowing Helms to address the convention. As expected, Helms was drafted by conservatives anyway, and won 54 votes, coming second. Helms was the &quot;spiritual leader of the conservative convention&quot;, and led the movement that successfully reversed the Republican Party&#x27;s 36-year platform support for an Equal Rights Amendment.

In the fall of 1980, Helms proposed another bill denying the Supreme Court jurisdiction over school prayer, but this found little support in committee. It was strongly opposed by mainline Protestant churches, and its counterpart was defeated in the House. Senators Helms and James A. McClure blocked Ted Kennedy&#x27;s comprehensive criminal code that did not relax federal firearms restrictions, inserted capital punishment procedures, and reinstated current statutory law on pornography, prostitution, and drug possession. Following from his success at reintroducing gold-indexed contracts in 1977, in October 1980, Helms proposed a return to the gold standard, and successfully passed an amendment setting up a commission to look into gold-backed currency. After the presidential election, Helms and Strom Thurmond sponsored a Senate amendment to a Department of Justice appropriations bill denying the department the power to participate in busing, due to objections over federal involvement, but, although passed by Congress, was vetoed by a lame duck Carter. Helms pledged to introduce an even stronger anti-busing bill as soon as Reagan took office.

===Republicans take the Senate===
In the 1980 Senate election, the Republicans unexpectedly won a majority, their first in twenty-six years, including John Porter East, a social conservative and a Helms protégé soon dubbed &quot;Helms on Wheels&quot;, winning the other North Carolina seat. Howard Baker was set to become Majority Leader, but conservatives, angered by Baker&#x27;s support for the Panama treaty, SALT II, and the Equal Rights Amendment, had sought to replace him with Helms until Reagan gave Baker his backing. Although, it was thought they&#x27;d put Helms in charge of the Foreign Relations Committee instead of the liberal Charles H. Percy, he instead became chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee in the new Congress.

The first six months of 1981 were consumed by numerous Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearings, which were held up by Helms, who believed many of the appointees too liberal or too tainted by association with Kissinger, and not dedicated enough to his definition of the &quot;Reagan program&quot;: support for South Africa, Taiwan, and Latin American right-wing regimes (as opposed to Black Africa and &quot;Red&quot; China). These nominations included Alexander Haig, Chester Crocker, John J. Louis Jr., and Lawrence Eagleburger, all of whom were confirmed regardless, while all of Helms&#x27;s candidates were rejected. Helms also, unsuccessfully, opposed the nominations of Caspar Weinberger, Donald Regan, and Frank Carlucci. However, he did score a notable coup two years later when he led a small group of conservatives to block the nomination of Robert T. Grey for nine months, and thus causing the firing of Eugene V. Rostow.

===Food stamp program===
An opponent of the Food Stamp Program, Helms had already voted to reduce its scope, and was determined to follow this through as Agriculture Committee chairman. At one point, he proposed a 40% cut in their funding. Instead, Helms supported the replacement of food stamps with workfare.

===Economic policies===
Helms supported the gold standard through his role as the Agriculture Committee chairman, which exercises wide powers over commodity markets. During the budget crisis of 1981, He restored $200 million for school lunches by instead cutting foreign aid, and against increases in grain and milk price support, despite the importance of the dairy industry to North Carolina. He warned repeatedly against costly farm subsidies as chairman. However, in 1983, he used his position to lobby to use the country&#x27;s strategic dairy and wheat stocks to subsidize food exports as part of a trade war with the European Union. Helms heavily opposed cutting food aid to Poland after martial law was declared, and called for the end of grain exports to (and arms limitation talks with) the Soviet Union instead.

In 1982, Helms authored a bill to introduce a federal flat tax of 10% with a personal allowance of $2,000. He voted against the 1983 budget: the only conservative senator to have done so, and was a leading voice for a balanced budget amendment. With Charlie Rose, he proposed a bill that would limit tobacco price supports, but would allow the transfer of subsidy credits from non-farmers to farmers. He co-sponsored the bi-partisan move in 1982 to extend drug patent duration. Helms continued to pose obstacles to Reagan&#x27;s budget plans. At the end of the 97th Congress, Helms led a filibuster against Reagan&#x27;s increase of federal gasoline tax by 5-cents per gallon: mirroring his opposition to Governor Jim Hunt&#x27;s 3-cent increase in the North Carolina gasoline tax, but alienating the White House from Helms.

===Social issues===
Although Helms recognized budget concerns and nominations as predominant, he rejected calls by Baker to move debate on social issues to 1982, with conservatives seeking to discuss abortion, school prayer, the minimum wage, and the &quot;fair housing&quot; policy. With the new Congress, Helms and Robert K. Dornan again proposed an amendment banning abortion in all circumstances, and also proposed a bill defining fetuses as human beings, thereby taking it out of the hands of the federal courts, along with Illinois Republican Henry Hyde and Kentucky Democrat Romano Mazzoli. More successfully, Helms passed an amendment banning federal funds from being used for abortion unless the woman&#x27;s life is in danger. His support was key to the nomination of C. Everett Koop as Surgeon General, by proposing lifting the age limit that would otherwise have ruled out Koop. He proposed an amendment taking school prayer out of the remit of the Supreme Court, which was criticized for being unconstitutional; despite Reagan&#x27;s endorsement, the bill was eventually rejected, after twenty months of dispute and numerous filibusters, in September 1982, by 51–48. Helms and Strom Thurmond sponsored another amendment to prevent the Department of Justice filing suits in defence of federal busing, which he contended wasted taxpayer money without improving education; this was filibustered by Lowell Weicker for eight months, but passed in March 1982. However, Democratic Speaker of the House Tip O&#x27;Neill blocked the measure from being considered by the House of Representatives.

In 1981, Helms started secret negotiations to end an 11-year impasse and pave the way for desegregation of historically white and historically black colleges in North Carolina. In response to a rival anti-discrimination bill in 1982, he proposed a bill outlawing granting tax-free status to schools that discriminated racially, but allowing schools that discriminate on the grounds of religion to avoid taxes. When the Voting Rights Act came up for amendment in 1982, Helms and Thurmond criticized it for bias against the South, arguing that it made Carolinians &quot;second-class citizens&quot; by treating their states differently, and proposed an amendment that extended its terms to the whole country, which they knew would bury it. However, it was extended anyway, despite Helms&#x27;s filibuster, which he promised to lead &quot;&quot;. In 1983, Helms hired Claude Allen, an African American, as his press secretary. Despite his publicly aired belief that he was one of the best-liked senators amongst black staff in Congress, it was pointed out that he did not have any African-American staff of his own, prompting the hiring of the twenty-two-year-old, who had switched parties when he was press secretary to Bill Cobey in the previous year&#x27;s campaign.

In 1983, Helms led the 16-day filibuster in the Senate opposing the proposed establishment of Martin Luther King Day as a federal holiday. Helms and others claimed, &quot;another federal holiday would be costly for the economy.&quot; Although the Congressional Budget Office cited a cost of $18 million, Helms claimed it would cost $12 billion a year. Helms &quot;distributed a 300-page packet claiming that the civil rights leader was a political radical who adopted &quot;action-oriented Marxism&quot; and detailing Dr. King&#x27;s supposed treachery&quot; in which he accused King of &quot;appear[ing] to have welcomed collaboration with Communists&quot;, Stanley Levison and Jack O&#x27;Dell. Helms ended the filibuster in exchange for a new tobacco bill. President Reagan signed the bill on October 19, 1983. Helms then demanded that FBI surveillance tapes allegedly detailing philandering on King&#x27;s part be released, although Reagan and the courts refused. The conservatives attempted to rename the day &quot;National Equality Day&quot; or &quot;National Civil Rights Day&quot;, but failed, and the bill was passed. Writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; several years later, David Broder attributed Helms&#x27; opposition to the MLK holiday to racism on Helms&#x27;s part.

===Latin America===
Upon the Republican takeover of the Senate, Helms became chairman of the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs, promising to &quot;review all our policies on Latin America&quot;, of which he had been severely critical under Carter. He immediately focused on escalating aid to the Salvadoran government in its civil war, and particularly preventing Nicaraguan and Cuban support for guerrillas in El Salvador. Within hours, the subcommittee approved military aid to El Salvador, and later led the push to cut aid to Nicaragua. Helms was assisted in pursuing the foreign policy realignment by John Carbaugh, whose influence &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported &quot;[rivalled] many of [the Senate&#x27;s] more visible elected members&quot;.

In El Salvador, Helms had close ties with the right-wing Salvadoran Nationalist Republican Alliance and its leader and death squad founder Roberto D&#x27;Aubuisson. Helms opposed the appointment of Thomas R. Pickering as Ambassador to El Salvador. Helms alleged that the CIA had interfered in the Salvadoran election March and May 1984, in favor of the incumbent centre-left José Napoleón Duarte instead of D&#x27;Aubuisson, claiming that Pickering had &quot;used the cloak of diplomacy to strangle freedom in the night&quot;. A CIA operative testifying to the Senate Intelligence Committee was alleged by Helms to have admitted rigging the election, but senators that attended have stated that, whilst the CIA operative admitted involvement, they did not make such an admission. Helms disclosed details of CIA financial support for Duarte, earning a rebuke from Barry Goldwater, but Helms replied that his information came from sources in El Salvador, not the Senate committee.

In 1982, Helms was the only senator who opposed a Senate resolution endorsing a pro-British policy during the Falklands War, citing the Monroe Doctrine, although he did manage to weaken the resolution&#x27;s language. Nonetheless, Helms was a supporter of the Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who supported the United Kingdom in the Falklands conflict. Helms was steadfastly opposed to the Castro regime in Cuba, and spent much of his time campaigning against the lifting of sanctions. In 1980, he opposed a treaty with Cuba on sea boundary delimitation unless it included withdrawal of the Soviet brigade stationed on the island. The following year, he proposed legislation establishing Radio Free Cuba, which would later become known as Radio Martí.

===1984 re-election campaign===
Halfway through Reagan&#x27;s term, Helms was talked about as a prospective presidential candidate in 1984 in case Reagan chose to stand down after his first term. There was also speculation that Helms would run for the Governorship, being vacated by Jim Hunt. However, the President stood for re-election, and Helms ran once more for his Senate seat—facing Governor Hunt—and becoming the top target among the incumbent Senate Republicans.

Unlike in 1978, Helms faced an opponent in the primary, George Wimbish, but won with 90.6% of the vote, while Hunt received 77% in his. During the general election campaign, Hunt accused Helms of having the most &quot;anti-Israel record of any member of the U.S. Senate&quot;. Helms pledged during the campaign that he would retain his chairmanship of the Agriculture committee.

In the most expensive Senate campaign up to that time, Helms narrowly defeated Hunt, taking 1,156,768 (51.7%) to Hunt&#x27;s 1,070,488 (47.8%).

==Third Senate term (1985–1991)==
In 1989, Helms hired James Meredith, most famous as the first African American ever admitted to the University of Mississippi, as a domestic policy adviser to his Senate office staff. Meredith noted that Helms was the only member of the Senate to respond to his offer.

In 1989, Helms successfully lobbied for an amendment to the Americans with Disabilities Act, legislation protecting disability rights that exempted pedophilia, schizophrenia, and kleptomania from the conditions against which discrimination was barred. Additionally, Helms proposed an amendment to exempt transvestism, which the Senate adopted. Even though the Helms amendments were kept in the final ADA bill that passed Congress in 1990, Helms twice voted against the bill.

===Foreign policy===
Although Helms was returned to office, and became the senior Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, Richard Lugar of Indiana became its chair, after Helms and Lugar cut a deal to keep liberals out of top committee posts. Despite pressure to claim the Foreign Relations chair, Helms kept the Agriculture chair, as he had pledged in his campaign.

A &quot;purge&quot; of the State Department by George P. Shultz in early 1985, replacing conservatives with moderates, was heavily opposed by the Helms-led conservatives. They unsuccessfully attempted to block the appointment of Rozanne L. Ridgway, Richard Burt, and Edwin G. Corr as ambassadors, arguing that Shultz was appointing diplomats who were not loyal to President Reagan&#x27;s philosophy, particularly in Latin America. In August 1985, Helms threatened to lead a filibuster against a bill imposing sanctions on South Africa, delaying it until after summer recess.

In early 1986, Panamanian dissident Winston Spadafora visited Helms and requested that the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs hold hearings on Panama. Ignoring Elliott Abrams&#x27; request for a softer line towards Panama, Helms—a long-time critic of Noriega—agreed, and the hearings uncovered the large degree of leeway that the U.S. government, and particularly the Central Intelligence Agency, had been giving to Noriega. After the Drug Enforcement Administration encountered opposition from Oliver North in investigating Noriega&#x27;s role in drug trafficking, Helms teamed up with John Kerry to introduce an amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act demanding that the CIA investigate the Panama Defense Forces&#x27; potential involvement. In 1988, after Noriega was indicted on charges including drug trafficking, a former Panamanian consul general and chief of political intelligence testified to the subcommittee, detailing Panama&#x27;s compiling of evidence on its political opponents in the United States, including Senators Helms and Ted Kennedy, with the assistance of the CIA and National Security Council. Helms proposed that the government suspend the Carter-Torrijos treaties unless Noriega were extradited within thirty days.

In July 1986, after Rodrigo Rojas DeNegri was burned alive during a street demonstration against the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet in Chile, Helms said that DeNegri and his companion Carmen Quintana Arancibia were &quot;Communist terrorists&quot; who had earlier been sighted setting fire to a barricade. Helms also criticized United States Ambassador to Chile Harry G. Barnes Jr. for attending DeNegri&#x27;s funeral, saying Barnes &quot;planted the American flag in the midst of a Communist activity&quot; and President Reagan would have sent him home were he there. The following month, the Justice Department disclosed information to Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that linked Helms and a sensitive intelligence matter of the Chile government. Helms responded to the disclosure by telling reporters that the Justice Department &quot;want to intimidate me and harass me, and it&#x27;s not going to work&quot; and said that both the Justice Department and himself were aware he had &quot;violated no rules of classification&quot;. In a letter to Attorney General Edwin Meese, Helms made a request of the Justice Department to investigate if he or members of his staff had been spied on during the Chile visit and called the charges against him &quot;frivolous and false indictment&quot;.

Helms became interested in the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue, and in October 1990 his committee staff chief and longest-serving aide, James P. Lucier, prepared a report stating that it was probable there were live American prisoners still being held in Vietnam and that the George H. W. Bush administration was complicit in hiding the facts. The report also alleged that the Soviet Union had held American prisoners after the end of World War II and more may have been transferred there during the Korean War and during the Vietnam War. (Lucier also believed that survivors of the 1983 shoot-down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 were being held prisoner by the Soviets.) Helms stated that the &quot;deeper story&quot; was a possible &quot;deliberate effort by certain people in the government to disregard all information or reports about living MIA-POWs&quot;. This was followed up in May 1991 by a minority report of the Foreign Relations Committee, released by Helms and titled &quot;An Examination of US Policy Toward POW/MIAs&quot;, which made similar claims and concluded that &quot;any evidence that suggested an MIA might be alive was uniformly and arbitrarily rejected ...&quot; The issuing of the report caused other Republicans on the committee to become angry, and charges were made that the report contained errors, innuendo, and unsubstantiated rumors. This and other personnel matters led to Helms firing Lucier and eight other staff members in January 1992. Helms subsequently distanced himself from the POW/MIA issue. (The aides claimed vindication later in 1992 when Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that the Soviet Union had kept some U.S. prisoners in the early 1950s.)

===HIV legislation===

In 1987, Helms added an amendment to the Supplemental Appropriations Act, which directed the president to use executive authority to add HIV infection to the list of excludable diseases that prevent both travel and immigration to the United States. The action was opposed by the U.S. Public Health Service. Congress restored the executive authority to remove HIV from the list of excludable conditions in the 1990 Immigration Reform Act, and in January 1991, Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan announced he would delete HIV from the list of excludable conditions. A letter-writing campaign headed by Helms ultimately convinced President Bush not to lift the ban, and left the United States the only industrialized nation in the world to prohibit travel based on HIV status. The travel ban was also responsible for the cancellation of the 1992 International AIDS Conference in Boston. On January 5, 2010, the 22-year-old ban was lifted after having been signed by President Barack Obama on October 30, 2009.

Helms was &quot;bitterly opposed&quot; to federal financing for research and treatment of AIDS, which he believed was God&#x27;s punishment for homosexuals. He introduced an amendment to a 1987 spending bill that prohibited the use of federal tax dollars for any AIDS educational materials that would &quot;promote or encourage, directly or indirectly, homosexual activities&quot;.

Opposing the Kennedy-Hatch AIDS bill in 1988, Helms incorrectly stated, &quot;There is not one single case of AIDS in this country that cannot be traced in origin to sodomy&quot;. When Ryan White, who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion he received at age 13, died in 1990, his mother went to Congress to speak to politicians on behalf of people with AIDS. She spoke to 23 representatives; Helms refused to speak to Jeanne White, even when she was alone with him in an elevator. Despite opposition by Helms, the Ryan White Care Act passed in 1990.

In 1988, Helms convinced congress to implement a ban on federal funding for needle exchange programs, arguing that spending federal money on such programs was tantamount to &quot;federal endorsement of drug abuse&quot;.

As late as 2002, Helms continued to claim that the &quot;homosexual lifestyle&quot; was the cause of the spread of AIDS in the United States, and he remained opposed to spending money on AIDS research.

===1990 re-election campaign===
In the 1990 Republican primary, Helms had two opponents, George Wimbish (as in 1984) and L.C. Nixon; Helms won with 84.3% of the vote. The general election was nationally publicized and rancorous. Helms ran against former Charlotte mayor Harvey Gantt in his &quot;bid to become the nation&#x27;s only black senator&quot; and &quot;the first black elected to the Senate from the South since Reconstruction&quot;.

The North Carolina GOP and others mailed over 125,000 notices (almost exclusively to black voters) telling them that they were not eligible to vote and warned that if they went to the polls they could be prosecuted for voter fraud. At the behest of several civil rights groups and the Democratic National Party, the US Department of Justice sued the Helms campaign, the NC GOP, four lobbying firms and two individual lobbyists. Thomas Farr, campaign manager for Helms, disavowed any knowledge of the dirty tricks, which was shown to be false when his hand written notes were discovered. The affected parties acknowledged and agreed to the Justice Departments&#x27; ruling and were forced to desist from any other such activities.

Helms aired a late-running television commercial titled &quot;Hands&quot;, also known as &#x27;White Hands,&#x27; that showed a white man&#x27;s hands crumpling up an employment rejection notice while a voiceover said, &quot;You needed that job, and you were the best qualified. But they had to give it to a minority because of a racial quota. Is that really fair? Harvey Gantt says it is.&quot; The advertisement was produced by Alex Castellanos, whom Helms would employ until his company was dropped in April 1996 after running an unusually hard-hitting ad. Another Helms television commercial accused Gantt of running a &quot;secret campaign&quot; in homosexual communities and of being committed to &quot;mandatory gay rights laws&quot; including &quot;requiring local schools to hire gay teachers&quot;.

Helms won the election with 1,087,331 votes (52.5 percent) to Gantt&#x27;s 981,573 (47.4 percent). In his victory statement, Helms noted the unhappiness of some media outlets over his victory, paraphrasing a line from &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot;: &quot;There&#x27;s no joy in Mudville tonight. The mighty ultra-liberal establishment, and the liberal politicians and editors and commentators and columnists have struck out.&quot;

==Fourth Senate term (1991–1997)==

In the early 1990s, Helms was a vocal opponent of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

In August 1991, Helms became one of six Republicans on the Select Senate Committee on POW-MIA Affairs that would investigate the number of Americans still missing in the aftermath of the Vietnam War following renewed interest.

=== Keating Five investigation ===
On August 5, 1991, Helms made public a special counsel report calling for California Senator Alan Cranston to be censured by the Senate on charges of reprehensible conduct. The document had been delivered to members of the Senate Ethics Committee the previous month. Helms stated that his move came from the belief that the release would cause the panel to act faster, additionally citing the panel members with being at odds on how much of the report should be released as a reason for not closing an inquiry into Charles H. Keating Jr. and his role in the savings and loan scandal of the late 1980s.

The Senate Ethics Committee subsequently voted to investigate Helms for releasing the confidential document. Helms issued a statement saying in part that it was &quot;a fascinating suggestion that I may have somehow violated some unspecified &#x27;rule&#x27; when I released, over the weekend, my own signed report regarding the Keating Five investigation&quot;. Helms welcomed the investigation into himself, along with one into the handling of the Keating Five case (five senators who received financial contributions from Keating Jr.) by the Senate Ethics Committee, calling the panel&#x27;s investigation &quot;long, arduous and expensive&quot; and noting a potential public investigation &quot;may disclose that the committee labored and brought forth a mouse&quot;.

=== National Endowment for the Arts ===
In 1989, the National Endowment for the Arts awarded grants for a retrospective of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs, some of which containing homosexual themes, in addition to a museum in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, supporting an exhibition that featured an image by Andres Serrano of a crucifix suspended in urine. These images caused an uproar and marked the National Endowment for the Arts becoming &quot;a favorite target for Mr. Helms and other conservative senators who have objected to the work of some of the artists who have received Government grants.&quot; In September 1989, Helms met with John E. Frohnmayer, President Bush&#x27;s appointee for Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. While neither spoke publicly about the meeting, Helms reportedly made it clear that he considered his opposition to certain N.E.A. grants to be an election issue, and his opposition would continue after the next election.

In September 1991, Helms charged the National Endowment for the Arts with financing art that would turn &quot;the stomach of any normal person&quot; while proposing an amendment to an appropriations bill forbidding the usage of the grants for the N.E.A. in promoting material that would be deemed as depicting &quot;sexual or excretory activities or organs&quot; in an &quot;offensive way&quot;. On September 20, the Senate voted 68 to 28 in favor of the amendment. The same night, Helms withdrew another amendment that changed the financing formula of the N.E.A. to funneling over half of its grant money through states as opposed to the Washington headquarters and would see a reduction in the New York fiscal year appropriation from its 26 million to just over 7 million.

===Remarks regarding Moseley Braun and Clinton===
In a widely publicized incident on July 22, 1993, Carol Moseley Braun, the first black woman in the Senate and the only black senator at the time, reported that Helms deliberately sought to offend her by whistling the song &quot;Dixie&quot; as the two shared an elevator. After Moseley Braun persuaded the Senate to vote against Helms&#x27;s amendment to extend the patent of the United Daughters of the Confederacy insignia, which included the Confederate flag, Moseley Braun claims that Helms ran into her in an elevator. Helms allegedly turned to Senator Orrin Hatch and said, &quot;Watch me make her cry. I&#x27;m going to make her cry. I&#x27;m going to sing &#x27;Dixie&#x27; until she cries.&quot; He then allegedly proceeded to sing the song about &quot;the good life&quot; during slavery to Moseley Braun. In 1999, Helms unsuccessfully attempted to block Moseley Braun&#x27;s nomination to be United States Ambassador to New Zealand.

In 1994, Helms created a sensation when he told broadcasters Rowland Evans and Robert Novak that Clinton was &quot;not up&quot; to the tasks of being commander-in-chief, and suggested two days later, on the anniversary of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, &quot;Mr. Clinton better watch out if he comes down here. He&#x27;d better have a bodyguard.&quot; Helms said Clinton was unpopular and that he had not meant it as a threat. Clinton addressed the comments when asked about them by a reporter at a press conference the following day: &quot;I think the remarks were unwise and inappropriate. The President oversees the foreign policy of the United States. And the Republicans will decide in whom they will repose their trust and confidence; that&#x27;s a decision for them to make, not for me.&quot;

During this term, Helms was one of three senators to vote against the confirmation of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court.

===Republican majority===
Republicans regained control of Congress after the 1994 elections and Helms finally became the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He was the first North Carolinian to chair the committee since Nathaniel Macon. In that role, Helms pushed for reform of the UN and blocked payment of the United States&#x27; dues. Helms secured sufficient reforms that a colleague, future President Joe Biden of Delaware said that &quot;As only Nixon could go to China, only Helms could fix the U.N.&quot;

Helms passed few laws of his own in part because of this bridge-burning style. Hedrick Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Power Game&quot; portrays Helms as a &quot;devastatingly effective power broker&quot;.

Helms tried to block the refunding of the Ryan White Care Act in 1995, saying that those with AIDS were responsible for the disease, because they had contracted it because of their &quot;deliberate, disgusting, revolting conduct&quot;, and that the reason AIDS existed in the first place was because it was &quot;God&#x27;s punishment for homosexuals&quot;. Helms also claimed that more federal dollars were spent on AIDS than heart disease or cancer, despite this not being borne out by the Public Health Service statistics.

===Helms–Burton Act===
Soon after becoming the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in February 1995, Helms announced that he wished to strengthen the spirit of the 1992 Torricelli Act with new legislation. Its companion sponsored through the House by Dan Burton of Indiana, it would strengthen the embargo against Cuba: further codifying the embargo, instructing United States diplomats to vote in favor of sanctions on Cuba, stripping the President of the option of ending the embargo by executive order until Fidel and Raúl Castro leave power and a prescribed course of transition is followed. The bill also, controversially explicitly overruling the Act of State Doctrine, allowed foreign companies to be sued in American courts if, in dealings with the regime of Fidel Castro, they acquired assets formerly owned by Americans.

Passing the House comfortably, the Senate was far more cautious, under pressure from the Clinton administration. The debate was filibustered, with a motion of cloture falling four votes short. Helms reintroduced the bill without Titles III and IV, which detailed the penalties on investors, and it passed by 74 to 24 on October 19, 1995. A conference committee was scheduled to convene, but did not until February 28, 1996, by which time external events had taken over. On February 24, Cuba shot down two small Brothers to the Rescue planes piloted by anti-Castro Cuban-Americans. When the conference committee met, the tougher House version, with all four titles, won out on most substantive points. It was passed by the Senate 74–22 and the House 336–86, and President Clinton signed the Helms-Burton Act into law on March 12, 1996. For years after its passing, Helms criticized the corporate interests that sought to lift the sanctions on Cuba, writing an article in 1999 for &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, at whose publisher, the Council on Foreign Relations, also drew Helms&#x27;s ire for its softer approach to Cuba.

===1996 re-election campaign===
In 1996, Helms drew 1,345,833 (52.6 percent) to Gantt&#x27;s 1,173,875 (45.9 percent). Helms supported his former Senate colleague Bob Dole for president, while Gantt endorsed Bill Clinton. Although Helms is generally credited with being the most successful Republican politician in North Carolina history, his largest proportion of the vote in any of his five elections was 54.5 percent. In North Carolina, Helms was a polarizing figure, and he freely admitted that many people in the state strongly disliked him: &quot;[The Democrats] could nominate Mortimer Snerd and he&#x27;d automatically get 45 percent of the vote.&quot; Helms was particularly popular among older, conservative constituents, and was considered one of the last &quot;Old South&quot; politicians to have served in the Senate. However, he also considered himself a voice of conservative youth, whom he hailed in the dedication of his autobiography.

==Fifth Senate term (1997–2003)==
===Weld ambassadorial nomination===
The summer of 1997 saw Helms engage in a protracted, high-profile battle to block the nomination of William Weld, Republican Governor of Massachusetts, as Ambassador to Mexico: refusing to hold a committee meeting to schedule a confirmation hearing. Although he did not make a formal statement of his reason, Helms did criticize Weld&#x27;s support for medical marijuana, which Senate conservatives saw as incompatible with Mexico&#x27;s key role in the War on Drugs. Weld attacked Helms&#x27;s politics, saying, &quot;I am not Senator Helms&#x27;s kind of Republican. I do not pass his litmus test on social policy. Nor do I want to.&quot; This opened Helms to counter on Weld&#x27;s positions on abortion, gay rights, and other issues on which he had a liberal position. Other factors, such as Weld&#x27;s noncommittal position on Helms&#x27;s chairmanship during his 1996 Senate campaign and Weld&#x27;s wife&#x27;s donation to the Gantt campaign, made the nomination personal and less cooperative. Held up in the committee by Helms, despite Weld resigning his governorship to concentrate on the nomination and a petition signed by most senators, his nomination died.

=== Cuba ===
In January 1998, Helms endorsed a legislative proposal by the Cuban-American National Foundation to provide 100 million worth of food and medicine so long as Havana could promise the assistance would not be allocated to government stores or officials of the Communist Party. In the same statement, Helms said Pope John Paul II&#x27;s visit to Cuba had &quot;created a historic opportunity for bold action&quot; in the country. On May 15, Helms announced a proposal of 100 million aid package for Cuba that would provide food and medical assistance to the Cuban people by the Roman Catholic Church and politically independent relief organizations. Helms stated the proposal would hurt Castro&#x27;s regime if he either accepted or rejected it and the proposal was endorsed by more than twenty senators from both parties. In his memoir, Helms stated the only reason Castro was able to maintain leadership in Cuba was the direct result of the Clinton administration not making his removal an objective of its foreign policy. He asserted the administration should have worked to develop strategies to undermine Castro and instead spent years &quot;wasting precious time and energy on a senseless debate over whether to lift the Cuban embargo unilaterally&quot;.

Helms saw the Bush administration as &quot;understanding of the nature&quot; of Castro and his crimes and stated his hope that an American president would eventually be able to visit Cuba at a time when the latter country and the United States could welcome each other as friends and trading partners.
In May 2001, Helms cosponsored legislation with Connecticut Democrat Joe Lieberman granting 100 million in aid to both government critics and independent workers in Cuba during the period of the following four years and said the aim of the bill was to provide financial assistance to domestic opponents of the Cuban government so that they could continue their work. The legislation was &quot;the first major legislative proposal by hard-line critics&quot; since the Helms–Burton Act and Helms promoted its enactment in a statement by saying it would see the United States government &quot;move beyond merely isolating the Castro regime&quot; which could be undermined &quot;by finding bold, proactive and creative programs to help those working for change on the island&quot;. In July, President Bush announced his intent to waive a portion of the Helms–Burton Act authorizing lawsuits against businesses operating in Cuba for six months in the national interest of the US and to aid administration efforts to &quot;expedite the transition to democracy in Cuba&quot;. Helms released a statement defending Bush, saying &quot;it would be wise to consider the other salutary initiatives that the president is putting into force&quot; before criticizing the decision and credited Bush with &quot;taking a very tough line which is certain to make Fidel Castro squirm&quot;.

===Final Senate years===

In January 1997, during the confirmation hearings for Secretary of State nominee Madeleine Albright, Helms stated President Clinton&#x27;s first term had left adversaries of the United States in doubt of their resolve and that &quot;a lot of Americans&quot; were praying she would issue in a change during her tenure. Two months later, after being confirmed, Albright traveled with Helms to his boyhood home and the Jesse Helms Center for discussions on the treaty to ban chemical arms, Helms afterward saying the pair would not have any issues if they continued being able to cooperate but stressed that the treaty would not assist with protecting Americans. In a March 1998 letter to Albright, Helms stated his opposition &quot;to the creation of a permanent U.N. criminal court&quot; and the United Nations becoming &quot;a sovereign entity&quot;, Helms spokesman Marc Thiessen confirming concerns of the senator &quot;that a permanent tribunal will turn into a petty claims court that will spend its time taking up complaints about the United States&quot; and thereby serve the function of the General Assembly.

In September 1997, amid the Senate voting to repeal a 50 billion tax break for the tobacco industry, Helms joined Mitch McConnell and Lauch Faircloth in being one of three senators to vote against the amendment.

In January 1998, President Clinton&#x27;s relationship with Monica Lewinsky became public. Helms found the revelation &quot;damning&quot;, having little patience for sexual transgressions and said anyone that would advocate President Clinton&#x27;s &quot;should be excused, already announced their total lack of character&quot;. In remarks the following month, Helms stated the scandal had left him saddened for the United States and President Clinton&#x27;s daughter Chelsea. Helms exercised caution on the impeachment issue, refraining from announcing his vote until right before Clinton&#x27;s Senate trial in January of the following year. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted Helms as the only one of the nine senators who had by then served a quarter century to vote in favor of Lewinsky making an appearance before the chamber. In his memoir, Helms stated that his vote against Clinton was not personal and that he understood &quot;the fallibility of every human, and the power of Grace&quot;, but that he was unwilling to deny the Constitution not allowing &quot;gradients of wrongdoing&quot; since Clinton was proven to have lied under oath.

In March 1998, after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to add Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Helms predicted the resolution would pass overwhelmingly in the full chamber and said the vote was a testament to &quot;confidence in the democracies of Eastern Europe&quot;.

In May 1998, while delivering remarks to Therma, Inc. employees, President Clinton listed Helms as one of the senators who had aided the intent of Partnership for Peace.

While the United States cast one of four votes against the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, adopted by a 120 to 4 vote in July 1998, President Clinton signed the Statute for the United States. However, Helms was strident in his opposition and let it be known that any attempt to have the Senate ratify the Statute would be &quot;dead on arrival&quot; at the Foreign Relations Committee. He also introduced the American Service-Members&#x27; Protection Act, adopted by Congress in 2002 &quot;to protect United States military personnel and other elected and appointed officials of the United States government against criminal prosecution by an international criminal court to which the United States is not party&quot;.

In June 1999, after President Clinton nominated Richard Holbrooke for United States Ambassador to the United Nations, the Clinton administration expressed concerns with Helms&#x27;s silence on whether he would allow a vote on Holbrooke&#x27;s nomination. In a June 5 statement, Helms announced the date of the four hearings and that Holbrooke would be questioned regarding his career, specifically his mediating role in negotiations of the Bosnia accords with President of Yugoslavia Slobodan Milošević. Helms added that he could not &quot;recall another Cabinet-level nomination sent to this committee with so much ethical baggage attached to it&quot;. During the confirmation hearings, Helms stated that Holbrooke had violated the law repeatedly. In response, Holbrooke apologized and admitted to his &quot;misconceptions&quot; regarding ethics, Helms afterward expressing optimism toward the nomination as a result of Holbrooke&#x27;s remorse. Three months later, after President Clinton nominating former Senator Carol Moseley-Braun for United States Ambassador to New Zealand, Helms released a statement saying the &quot;nomination comes to the Senate with an ethical cloud hanging over Ms. Moseley-Braun&quot; and questioned if her record had even been examined by the Clinton administration. An article published around the same time as the statement by &quot;Roll Call&quot; indicated Helms would prevent the nomination unless Moseley-Braun &quot;amends for past slights&quot; such as her opposition to the renewal of the emblem for the Daughters of the Confederacy. Helms subsequently demanded documents relating to Moseley-Braun&#x27;s ethical charges and delayed confirmation hearings until receiving them. On November 9, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to endorse Moseley-Braun 17 to 1, Helms being the lone vote against the nomination. When the Senate voted to confirm Moseley-Braun, Helms was joined by Peter Fitzgerald, who defeated Moseley-Braun in her re-election bid, in being the only two senators to vote against her.

In 2000, Bono sought out Jesse Helms to discuss increasing American aid to Africa. In Africa, AIDS is a disease that is primarily transmitted heterosexually, and Helms sympathized with Bono&#x27;s description of &quot;the pain it is bringing to infants and children and their families&quot;. Helms insisted that Bono involve the international community and private sector, so that relief efforts would not be paid for by &quot;just Americans&quot;. Helms coauthored a bill authorizing $600 million for international AIDS relief efforts. In 2002, Helms announced that he was ashamed to have done so little during his Senate career to fight the worldwide spread of AIDS, and pledged to do more during his last few months in the Senate. Helms spoke with special appreciation of the efforts of Janet Museveni, first lady of Uganda, for her efforts to stop the spread of AIDS through a campaign based on &quot;biblical values and sexual purity&quot;. Helms also was a proponent in trying to dissolve the United States Agency for International Development.

In January 2001, Helms stated he would support an increase in international assistance on the condition that all future aid from the United States be provided to the needy by private charities and religious groups as opposed to a government agency, and endorsed abolishing the United States Agency for International Development and concurrently transferring its 7 billion in annual aid to another foundation which would give grants to private relief groups.

In March 2002, Helms and Democrat Joe Biden, in their positions as the ranking members of their parties on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, submitted a letter to the Bush administration demanding the Senate receive any nuclear arms reductions with Russia as a formal treaty.

===Retirement===
Because of recurring health problems, including bone disorders, prostate cancer and heart disease, Helms did not seek re-election in 2002. His Senate seat was won by Republican Elizabeth Dole.

==Post-Senate life (2003–2008)==

In 2004, he spoke out for the election of Republican U.S. Representative Richard Burr, who, like Elizabeth Dole two years earlier, defeated Democrat Erskine Bowles to win the other North Carolina Senate seat. In September 2005, Random House published his memoir &quot;Here&#x27;s Where I Stand&quot;. In his memoirs, he likened abortion to the Holocaust and the September 11 terrorist attacks stating, &quot;I will never be silent about the death of those who cannot speak for themselves.&quot; 

In 1994, after turning down requests for his papers to be left to an Ivy League university, he designated Wingate University as the repository of the official papers and historical items from his Senate career, where the Jesse Helms Center is based to promote his legacy. In 2005, Liberty University opened the Jesse Helms School of Government with Helms present at the dedication.

===Death===
Helms&#x27;s health remained poor after he retired from the Senate in 2003. In April 2006, news reports disclosed that Helms had vascular dementia, which leads to failing memory and diminished cognitive function, as well as a number of physical difficulties. He was later moved into a convalescent center near his home. Helms died of vascular dementia on July 4, 2008, at the age of 86. He is buried in Historic Oakwood Cemetery in Raleigh, North Carolina.

==Social and political views==
===Views on race===
Jesse Helms was accused of racism throughout his career. Two years before Helms&#x27;s 2003 retirement from the Senate, David Broder of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote a column headlined &quot;Jesse Helms, White Racist&quot;, analyzing Helms&#x27;s public record on race, a record he felt many other reporters were side-stepping. He said that Helms was willing to inflame racial resentment against African-Americans for political gain and dubbed Helms &quot;the last prominent unabashed white racist politician in this country&quot;.

Early in his career, as news director for WRAL radio, Helms supported Willis Smith in the 1950 Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate, against Frank Porter Graham, in a campaign that used racial issues in a divisive way, in order to draw conservative white voters to the polls. Portraying Graham as favoring interracial marriages, the campaign circulated placards with the heading, &quot;White people, wake up before it is too late&quot;; and a handbill that showed Graham&#x27;s wife dancing with a black man. When Smith won, Helms went to Washington as his administrative assistant.

Helms opposed busing, the Civil Rights Act, and enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. Helms called the Civil Rights Act of 1964 &quot;the single most dangerous piece of legislation ever introduced in the Congress&quot;, and sponsored legislation to either extend it to the entire country or scrap it altogether. In 1982, he voted against the extension of the Voting Rights Act.

Helms reminded voters that he tried, with a 16-day filibuster, to stop the Senate from approving a federal holiday to honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., although he had fewer reservations about establishing a North Carolina state holiday for King. He was accused of being a segregationist by some political observers and scholars, such as &quot;USA Today&quot; DeWayne Wickham who wrote that Helms &quot;subtly carried the torch of white supremacy&quot; from Ben Tillman. Helms never stated that segregation was morally wrong and expressed the belief that integration would have been achieved voluntarily but that it was forced by &quot;outside agitators who had their own agendas&quot;.

In 1990, former Charlotte mayor Harvey Gantt ran against Helms in a &quot;bid to become the nation&#x27;s only black senator&quot; and &quot;the first black elected to the Senate from the South since Reconstruction&quot;.
Helms aired a late-running television commercial titled &quot;Hands&quot;, also known as &quot;White Hands&quot;, that showed a white man&#x27;s hands crumpling an employment rejection notice while a voiceover said, &quot;You needed that job, and you were the best qualified. But they had to give it to a minority because of a racial quota. Is that really fair? Harvey Gantt says it is.&quot; During the same election, Helms&#x27;s campaign mailed 125,000 postcards to households in predominantly African-American precincts falsely claiming if people voted without updating their addresses on the electoral register since their last move they could go to jail.

Helms was one of 52 senators to vote to confirm Clarence Thomas, an African American, to the Supreme Court as an associate justice in 1991.

In 1993, after Carol Moseley Braun, the first black woman in the Senate and the only black senator at the time, persuaded the Senate to vote against Helms&#x27;s amendment to extend the patent of the United Daughters of the Confederacy insignia, which included the Confederate flag, Moseley Braun claimed Helms ran into her in an elevator, and that Helms turned to Senator Orrin Hatch and said, &quot;Watch me make her cry. I&#x27;m going to make her cry. I&#x27;m going to sing &quot;Dixie&quot; until she cries,&quot; and proceeded to sing the song about &quot;the good life&quot; during slavery. In 1999, Helms unsuccessfully attempted to block Moseley Braun&#x27;s nomination to be United States Ambassador to New Zealand.

Besides opposing civil rights and affirmative action legislation, Helms blocked many black judges from being considered for the federal bench, and black appointees to positions of prominence in the Federal Government. In one instance, he blocked attempts by President Bill Clinton over a period of years to appoint a black judge on the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Only when Helms&#x27;s own judicial choices were threatened with blocking did attorney Roger Gregory of Richmond, Virginia get confirmed.

===Views on homosexuality===
Helms had a negative view of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people and LGBT rights in the United States. Helms called homosexuals &quot;weak, morally sick wretches&quot; and tried to cut funding for the National Endowment for the Arts for supporting the &quot;gay-oriented artwork of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe&quot;. In 1993, when then-president Bill Clinton wanted to appoint &#x27;out&#x27; lesbian Roberta Achtenberg to assistant secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Helms held up the confirmation &quot;because she&#x27;s a damn lesbian&quot;, adding &quot;she&#x27;s not your garden-variety lesbian. She&#x27;s a militant-activist-mean lesbian&quot;. Helms also stated &quot;I&#x27;m not going to put a lesbian in a position like that. If you want to call me a bigot, fine.&quot; When Clinton urged that gays be allowed to serve openly in the armed forces, Helms said the president &quot;better have a bodyguard&quot; if he visited North Carolina. His views on gay and lesbian citizens were depicted in the 1998 documentary film &quot;Dear Jesse&quot;.

Helms initially fought against increasing federal financing for HIV/AIDS research and treatment, saying the disease resulted from &quot;unnatural&quot; and &quot;disgusting&quot; homosexual behavior. In his final year in the Senate, he strongly supported AIDS measures in Africa, where heterosexual transmission of the disease is most common, and continued to hold the belief that the &quot;homosexual lifestyle&quot; is the cause of the spread of the epidemic in America.

During his 1990 campaign against Harvey Gantt, Helms ran television commercials accusing Gantt of running a &quot;secret campaign&quot; in homosexual communities and of being committed to &quot;mandatory gay rights laws&quot; including &quot;requiring local schools to hire gay teachers&quot;.

In 1993, when he voted against confirming Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court, he cited her support for the &quot;homosexual agenda&quot; as one of his reasons for doing so.

In his 2017 memoir, &quot;Logical Family&quot;, gay author Armistead Maupin recalls that Helms described homosexuality as an &quot;abomination&quot; when he was working for him as a young man. Maupin adds that he later gave an interview about his first novel on the same TV station, and said, &quot;I worked here when Jesse Helms was here. Now he&#x27;s in Washington, ranting about militant homosexuals, and I&#x27;m out running around being one.&quot;

==Personal life==
===Family===
Helms and his wife Dot had two daughters, Jane and Nancy, and adopted a nine-year-old orphan with cerebral palsy named Charles after reading in a newspaper that Charles wanted a mother and father for Christmas. The couple had seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild. One of his grandchildren, Jennifer Knox, later became a judge in Wake County, North Carolina.

===Religious views===
Helms was well known for his strong Christian religious views. He played a leading role in the development of the Christian right, and was a founding member of the Moral Majority in 1979. Although a Southern Baptist from his upbringing in a strictly literalist, but hawkishly secularist, environment, when in Raleigh, Helms worshipped at the moderate Hayes-Barton Baptist Church, where he had served as a deacon and Sunday school teacher before his election to the Senate.

Helms was close to fellow North Carolinian Billy Graham (whom he considered a personal hero), as well as Charles Stanley, Pat Robertson, and Jerry Falwell, whose Liberty University dedicated its Jesse Helms School of Government to Helms. Helms helped found Camp Willow Run, an interdenominational Christian summer camp, sitting on its board of directors until his death, and was a Grand Orator of the Masonic Grand Lodge of North Carolina.

Equating leftism and atheism, Helms argued that the downfall of the U.S. was due to loss of Christian faith, and often stated, &quot;I think God is giving this country one more chance to save itself&quot;. He believed that the morality of capitalism was assured in the Bible, through the Parable of the Talents. He believed, writing in &quot;When Free Men Shall Stand&quot;, that &quot;such utopian slogans as Peace with Honor, Minimum Wage, Racial Equality, Women&#x27;s Liberation, National Health Insurance, Civil Liberty&quot; are ploys by which to divide humanity &quot;as sons of God&quot;.

===Awards===
Helms held honorary degrees from several religious universities including Bob Jones University, Campbell University, Grove City College, and Wingate University which he attended but did not receive a degree.

<text>Addington Palace is an 18th-century mansion in Addington located within the London Borough of Croydon. It was built close to the site of an earlier manor house belonging to the Leigh family. It is particularly known for having been, between 1807 and 1897, the summer residence of the Archbishops of Canterbury. Since the 1930s most of the grounds have been occupied by Addington Palace Golf Club. Between 1953 and 1996 the mansion was occupied by the Royal School of Church Music, which has since moved to Salisbury. It was later used as a wedding and events venue.

==History==
The original manor house called Addington Place was built about the 16th century.

An ancient recipe for Malepigernout (or dillegrout), a spiced chicken porridge, was historically made by the current Lord of the Manor of Addington to be served upon the coronation of the monarch of England in a kitchen serjeanty. The Leigh family gained this serjeanty upon becoming Lords of the Manor of Addington sometime before 1504. The Addington estate was owned by the Leigh family until the early 18th century.

The last owner Sir John Leigh died without heirs in 1737 and his estates went to distant relatives, who eventually sold to Barlow Trecothick. Trecothick had been brought up in Boston, Massachusetts, and became a merchant there. He then moved to London, still trading as a merchant, and later sat as Member of Parliament (MP) for the City of London in 1768–74, and served as Lord Mayor in 1770. He bought the estate for £38,500 ().

He built a new house, designed by Robert Mylne in the Palladian style; a country mansion with single-storey wings. He died before it was completed in 1774 and it was inherited by his heir, James Ivers of Boston MA, who had to take the surname Trecothick in order to inherit the estate. James continued the work on the house, having the substantial grounds and gardens landscaped by Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown. Owing to financial difficulties, James Trecothick had to sell the estate in 1802. The estate was sold in lots in 1803. The next owners (William Coles and Westgarth Snaith) also got into financial trouble and sold it by act of Parliament in 1807. This enabled the mansion to be purchased for the Archbishops of Canterbury, since nearby Croydon Palace had become dilapidated and inconvenient. The name became Addington Farm whilst owned by the archbishops, much later it became known as Addington Palace. The archbishops made further changes and enlarged the building; work on the building was overseen by Richard Norman Shaw.

It became the official summer residence of six archbishops:
*Charles Manners-Sutton (Archbishop 1805–1828)
*William Howley (Archbishop 1828–1848)
*John Bird Sumner (Archbishop 1848–1862)
*Charles Thomas Longley (Archbishop 1862–1868)
*Archibald Campbell Tait (Archbishop 1868–1882)
*Edward White Benson (Archbishop 1883–1896)

All except Benson are buried in St Mary&#x27;s Church or churchyard, Addington: Benson is buried in Canterbury Cathedral.

The house was sold in 1897 to Frederick Alexander English, a diamond merchant from South Africa. After his death, the mansion was taken over during the First World War by the Red Cross and became a fever hospital. Eventually, in 1930, it came into the hands of the County Borough of Croydon.

==Current usage==
The house was Grade II* listed in 1951. In 1953, it was leased to the Royal School of Church Music, initially to house choirboys assembled from all over Britain to sing at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The building housed the Royal School of Church Music&#x27;s music publishing operation, residential college and choir school until 1996, when a private company took it over for development as a conference and banqueting venue, health farm and country club. It was used extensively for weddings until the company operating it went into liquidation in 2021.

It is surrounded by a park and golf courses, and its gardens are still largely in their original design. Much of the grounds have been leased by golf clubs and the exclusive Bishops Walk housing development was built on Bishops Walk (a private road).

A large cedar of Lebanon stands next to the palace, one of the Great Trees of London.

<doc id="133258" wikidata="Q16833741" url="?curid=133258" title="Drunk driving in the United States">
<text>Drunk driving is the act of operating a motor vehicle with the operator&#x27;s ability to do so impaired as a result of alcohol consumption, or with a blood alcohol level in excess of the legal limit. For drivers 21 years or older, driving with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.08% or higher is illegal. For drivers under 21 years old, the legal limit is lower, with state limits ranging from 0.00 to 0.02. Lower BAC limits apply when operating boats, airplanes, or commercial vehicles. Among other names, the criminal offense of drunk driving may be called [[driving under the influence]] (DUI), driving while intoxicated or impaired (DWI), operating a] vehicle under the influence of alcohol (OVI), or operating while impaired (OWI).

==Notability==
===Prevalence===
According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, approximately 1.5 million drunk driving arrests were made nationwide in 1996. In 1997 an estimated 513,200 DUI offenders were under correctional supervision, down from 593,000 in 1990 and up from 270,100 in 1986.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that in 1996 local law enforcement agencies made 1,467,300 arrests nationwide for driving under the influence of alcohol, 1 out of every 10 arrests for all crimes in the U.S., compared to 1.9 million such arrests during the peak year in 1983, accounting for 1 out of every 80 licensed drivers in the U.S. This represented a 220% increase in DUI arrests from 1970 to 1986, while the number of licensed drivers increased by just 42% in the same period.

The arrest rate for alcohol-related offenses among Native Americans was more than double that for the total population during 1996, and almost 4 in 10 Native Americans held in local jails had been charged with a public order offense, most commonly driving while intoxicated. In 2012, 29.1 million people admitted to driving under the influence of alcohol.

Recent analysis has shown cities in which ride sharing services operate show mixed results as to whether the availability of those services affects rates of impaired driving.

===Traffic collisions, injuries and fatalities===

The risk of having a traffic collision increases with a higher BAC.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that about 18,000 people died in 2006 from alcohol-related collisions, representing 40% of total traffic deaths in the US. Over the decade 2001–2010, this rate showed only a 3% variation, and no trend.

Drivers with a BAC of 0.10% are 6 to 12 times more likely to get into a fatal collision or injury than drivers without positive blood alcohol.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.nhtsa.gov/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The NHTSA states 275,000 were injured in alcohol-related collisions in 2003. Approximately 60% of the BAC values for motor vehicle collisions are missing or unknown. To analyze what they believe is the complete data, statisticians estimate BAC information.

The NHTSA defines fatal collisions as &quot;alcohol-related&quot; if they believe the driver, a passenger, or non-motorist (such as a pedestrian or pedal cyclist) had a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.01% or greater. The NHTSA defines nonfatal collisions as alcohol-related if the crash report indicates evidence of alcohol present, even if no driver or occupant was tested for alcohol. The NHTSA specifically notes that alcohol-related does not necessarily mean a driver or non-occupant was tested for alcohol and that the term does not indicate a collision or fatality was caused by the presence of alcohol. If anyone involved in the crash (even a passenger) has a BAC of 0.01% or greater, then the NTHSA classifies the crash as alcohol-related. Alcohol-related injuries were estimated at 275,000 in 2003.

According to NTSB, 100,000 people have died in alcohol-impaired driving crashes between the NTSB issued its 2013 Reaching Zero report and 2022.

==Laws and regulations==
For the most part, DUI or DWI are synonymous terms that represent the criminal offense of operating (or in some jurisdictions merely being in physical control of) a motor vehicle while being under the influence of alcohol or drugs or a combination of both. The key inquiry focuses on whether the driver&#x27;s faculties were impaired by the substance that was consumed. The detection and successful prosecution of drivers impaired by prescription medication or illegal drugs can therefore be difficult. Breathalyzers have been developed for the purpose of administering roadside or laboratory tests that can detect the actual level of a controlled substance in an individual&#x27;s body.

===History===

New Jersey enacted the first law that specifically criminalized driving an automobile while intoxicated, in 1906. The New Jersey statute provided that &quot;[n]o intoxicated person shall drive a motor vehicle.&quot; Violation of this provision was punishable by a fine of up to $500, or a term of up to 60 days in county jail.

Early laws, such as that enacted in New Jersey, required proof of a state of intoxication with no specific definition of what level of inebriation qualified. The first generally accepted legal BAC limit was 0.15%. New York, for example, which had enacted a prohibition on driving while intoxicated in 1910, amended this law in 1941 to provide that it would constitute prima facie evidence of intoxication when an arrested person was found to have a BAC of 0.15 percent or higher, as ascertained through a test administered within two hours of arrest.

In 1938, the American Medical Association created a &quot;Committee to Study Problems of Motor Vehicle Accidents&quot;. At the same time, the National Safety Council set up a &quot;Committee on Tests for Intoxication&quot;.

In the US, most of the laws and penalties were greatly enhanced starting in the late 1970s, and through the 1990s, largely due to pressure from groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Students Against Destructive Decisions (SADD) and activists like Candy Lightner whose 13-year-old daughter Cari was killed by a drunk driver. Zero tolerance laws were enacted which criminalized driving a vehicle with 0.01% or 0.02% BAC for drivers under 21. This is true even in Puerto Rico, despite maintaining a legal drinking age of 18. Research in the American Economic Review suggests that sanctions imposed at BAC thresholds are effective in reducing repeat drunk driving.

On May 14, 2013, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended that all 50 states lower the benchmark for determining when a driver is legally drunk from 0.08 blood-alcohol content to 0.05. The idea is part of an initiative to eliminate drunk driving, which accounts for about a third of all road deaths.

In 2022, this BAC reduction was implemented by Utah with success when some states failed and other did not try to implement BAC reduction.

===Federal law===
After the passage of federal legislation, the legal limit for commercial drivers is now set at 0.04%. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulation prohibits those who hold a commercial driver&#x27;s license from driving with an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater. A commercial driver with an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04, must be removed from duty for 24 hours.

In 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States, in &quot;Birchfield v. North Dakota&quot;, held that both breath tests and blood tests constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment, concluding that requiring breath tests is constitutional without a search warrant; however, requiring more intrusive blood tests involving piercing the skin is not, as the goal of traffic safety can be obtained by less invasive means.

===State law===
In construing the terms DUI, DWI, OWI and OVI, some states make it illegal to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence or driving while intoxicated while others indicate that it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle. There is a split of authority across the country regarding this issue. Some states permit enforcement of DUI, DWI, and OWI/OVI statutes based on &quot;operation and control&quot; of a vehicle, while others require actual &quot;driving&quot;. &quot;The distinction between these terms is material, for it is generally held that the word &#x27;drive,&#x27; as used in statutes of this kind, usually denotes movement of the vehicle in some direction, whereas the word &#x27;operate&#x27; has a broader meaning so as to include not only the motion of the vehicle, but also acts which engage the machinery of the vehicle that, alone or in sequence, will set in motion the motive power of the vehicle.&quot;

All states in the U.S. designate a &quot;per se&quot; blood or breath alcohol level as the threshold point for an independent criminal offense. This is often referred to as the &quot;legal limit&quot;. It is a permissive presumption of guilt where the person&#x27;s BAC is 0.08% or greater (units of milligrams per deciliter, representing 8 g of alcohol in 10 liters of blood). Some states (e.g., Colorado) include a lesser charge, sometimes referred to as &quot;driving while ability impaired&quot; that may apply to individuals with a 0.05% or above, but less than the 0.08% per se limit for the more serious charge.

All states have a &quot;catch-all&quot; provision designed to cover those circumstances where the person is below 0.08%, but the person still appears impaired by definition of law. These types of &quot;catch-all&quot; statutes cover situations involving a person under the influence of drugs or under the combined influence of alcohol and drugs. With the advent of the legalization of marijuana, these catch-all provisions cover those prosecutions pursuing those charged with driving under the influence of drugs or even drugs and alcohol. 

All US states have implied consent laws which state that a licensed driver has given their consent to an evidential breathalyzer or similar manner of determining blood alcohol concentration; however, in order to sustain a conviction based on evidence from a chemical test, probable cause for arrest must be demonstrated. Field sobriety tests (FSTs or SFSTs) and preliminary breath tests (PBTs) are often used to obtain such probable cause evidence, necessary for arrest or invoking implied consent.

Every state has enhanced penalties for refusing to submit to an Implied Consent Test pursuant to the State&#x27;s Implied Consent Laws. In California, refusing to submit to a test of one&#x27;s breath or blood upon being arrested for driving under the influence carries an additional punishment of a one-year license suspension pursuant to California Vehicle Code Section 13558(c)(1). Some states have passed laws that impose criminal penalties based upon principles of implied consent. However, in 2016, the Kansas Supreme Court ruled that Kansans who refuse to submit to either a breath or blood test in DUI investigations cannot be criminally prosecuted for that refusal. The court found unconstitutional a state law making it a crime to refuse such a test when no court-ordered warrant exists. In its 6-1 ruling, the court found that the tests were in essence searches and the law punishes people for exercising their constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.

===Bicycle DUI===
Approximately twenty to thirty states have criminalized impaired riding of a bicycle, whereas others have no sanctions relevant to cycling. Most such laws extend driving laws to all vehicles (&quot;all vehicles&quot; as opposed to &quot;motor vehicles&quot;), but a few address impaired bike riding separately. In some states, enhanced penalties are automobile-specific. Some states, notably Oregon, do not extend the implied consent law to cyclists. While police activities targeting impaired cyclists are rare, a cyclist could encounter police in a circumstance where the cyclist would otherwise be ticketed.

===Physician reporting===
Six states require physicians to report patients who drive while impaired. Another 25 states permit physicians to violate doctor-patient confidentiality to report impaired drivers, if they so choose. The American Medical Association endorsed physician reporting in 1999, but deferred to the states on whether such notification should be mandatory or permissive. Medical bioethicist Jacob Appel of New York University says physician reporting may deter some patients from seeking care, writing &quot;Reporting may remove some dangerous drivers from the roads, but if in doing so it actually creates other dangerous drivers, by scaring them away from treatment, then society has sacrificed confidentiality for no tangible return in lives saved.&quot;

===Federal regulation===

The United States Federal Railroad Administration and Federal Aviation Administration, both of which are part of the USDOT, respectively impose a 0.04% BAC limit for train crew and aircrew.

===Private employers===
Some U.S. employers impose their own rules for drug and alcohol use by employees who operate motor vehicles. For example, the Union Pacific Railroad imposes a BAC limit of 0.02%, that if, after an on-duty traffic crash, the determination that an employee violated that rule may result in termination of employment with no chance of future rehire.

==Penalties==
The consequences of an impaired driving charge include both criminal and administrative penalties. Criminal penalties are imposed as a result of criminal prosecution. Administrative penalties are imposed by a state agency, and in some cases may apply even if a person stopped for impaired driving is not convicted of the offense.

===Criminal penalties===
The penalties for drunk driving vary among states and jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for the penalties to be different from county to county within any given state depending on the practices of the individual jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions require jail time and larger fines, even on a first offense. For instance, Ohio requires a mandatory 72-hour jail sentence for a first offense conviction; however, the jail time component is satisfied by attendance of the Ohio A.W.A.R.E. Program, which is a 72-hour alcohol-education program. Compared to many other countries, such as Sweden, penalties for drunk driving in the United States are considered less severe unless alcohol is involved in an incident causing injury or death of another, such as DUI, DWI or OWI with Great Bodily Injury (GBI) or Vehicular Manslaughter.

====Diversion programs====
The State of Washington used to permit those charged with a first offense drunk driving to complete a diversion program that resulted in the charges being dismissed upon the completion of a Diversion Program. In 1975, under the revised code of Washington or RCW Section 10.05, the Washington State Legislature established a deferred prosecution option for offenders arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or impairing drugs (DUI). It was intended to encourage individuals to seek appropriate treatment and, under this option, defendants with a significant alcohol or drug dependence problem could petition a court to defer disposition of their charge until they have completed intensive substance dependence treatment and met other conditions required by the court. If the defendant successfully completed the terms of the program, the charge was dismissed; for those who failed, the deferred status was revoked and the defendant was prosecuted for the original DUI charge. (RCW 10.05.010 and 10.05.020) In 1992, the University of Washington Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute evaluated DUI deferred prosecution and concluded the program reduced DUI recidivism.
In 1998, the legislature modified the DUI statutes. Among other things, the length of deferred prosecution supervision was increased from two to five years and defendants were restricted to one deferred prosecution per lifetime.

====Driving While Impaired court====

These innovative courts use substance abuse intervention with repeat offenders who plead guilty to driving while intoxicated. Those accepted into the diversionary program are required to abstain from alcohol. Some are required to wear a device that monitors and records any levels of alcohol detected in their bloodstreams.

===Administrative penalties===
The federal Assimilative Crimes Act, which makes state law applicable on lands reserved or acquired by the Federal government when the act or omission is not made punishable by an enactment of Congress, recognizes collateral actions related to DUI convictions as punishments. According to :

====SR-22 - Proof of Financial Responsibility====
An SR-22 is an addendum to an insurance policy. It is an administrative form that attests to an insurance company&#x27;s coverage, or the posting of a personal public bond in the amount of the state&#x27;s minimum liability coverage for the licensed driver or vehicle registration. The SR in SR-22 stands for Safety Responsibility, and it is needed to reinstate a suspended driver&#x27;s license after a DUI conviction in 49 states and the District of Columbia. It is submitted to the State&#x27;s DMV by an auto insurance company to serve as proof that a driver has the minimum liability insurance that the states requires. They are essentially an agreement between a driver&#x27;s insurance company and the respective State&#x27;s DMV that requires the driver&#x27;s insurance company to notify the respective State&#x27;s DMV that the driver&#x27;s insurance has either been terminated or lapsed; thus instituting a suspension of the driver&#x27;s driving privileges until proof of insurance is re-filed with the State&#x27;s DMV.

While SR-22s are typically filed with the respective State&#x27;s DMV, some States require the driver to carry proof of the SR-22 or to carry it in the registered vehicle, (particularly if the driver has been cited for coverage lapses or other administrative infractions). SR-22s may attest coverage for a vehicle regardless of operator (owner liability coverage), or cover a specific person regardless of the specific vehicle operated (operator liability coverage).

As stated, the form is required in 49 states and the US District of Columbia in order to register a vehicle for usage on public roads. It is also required to redeem a license which has been suspended due to coverage lapse in these required states. These states also, generally, require that the issuing insurance company provide the relevant state&#x27;s DMV with timely updates as to the status of such coverage. If the policy with the SR22 cancels, a form called an SR26 is issued and sent to the state DMV. Upon notice that there has been a lapse in coverage, the state will suspend the driver&#x27;s license again. Another SR-22 filing will need to be submitted to regain driving privileges.

====Alcohol education programs====
Every jurisdiction imposes the completion of alcohol education programs, commonly known as DUI programs, subsequent to a DUI/DWI/OWI conviction. Additionally, some states impose an additional requirement that a person attend a Victim Impact Panel (VIP) administered by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), which was established in 1982. Both DUI classes and Victim Impact Panels are available in some states for first offense DUIs dependent on the judge&#x27;s decision.

====DUI Plates====

In 1967, Ohio began to issue special license plates to DUI offenders who are granted limited driving privileges such as work-related driving until a court can rule that they can have full privileges back. In 2004, the plates became mandated by state law to all DUI offenders. Unlike Ohio&#x27;s standard-issue plates (which as of 2008 have a picture of the Ohio countryside), the DUI plates are yellow with red writing with no registration stickers or graphics. They are commonly referred to as &quot;party plates&quot;.

Minnesota has a similar program, where the plates are white with either blue or black text. The plate number is a &quot;W&quot;, followed by a letter and four numbers. These plates may be issued to drivers with at least two offenses in a five-year period; three offenses in a ten-year period; having a BAC twice the legal limit; or having a child in the car at the time of arrest. In Minnesota, DUI plates are referred to as &quot;whiskey plates&quot;, whiskey being the name of the letter W in the NATO phonetic alphabet.

====Ignition interlock devices====

Most states impose the installation of ignition interlock devices (IID), with varying thresholds for installation requirements. Criminal process thresholds for installation requirements vary between minimum BAC levels (e.g., 0.20%, or 0.15%) or repeat offense, with about half of the states requiring installation on first offense.

These ignition interlock sanctions are meant as punishment, but also as a deterrence. When required under a high BAC level or multiple offense threshold, ignition interlock requirements address a strong tendency of repeat offense by drivers with alcoholic use disorder (AUD or alcoholism).

Ignition interlock requirements are also imposed in some instances after positive chemical blood alcohol tests, as a physical deterrent for drivers with alcoholic use disorder, or as a pseudo-civil punishment. Ignition interlock requirements are also imposed in some instances after an implied consent refusal under similar forensic procedures.

=====Operation of IIDs=====
In most US implementations, IIDs are set to a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; level (set to either levels consistent with culinary alcohol or measurement errors). Violations can occur from a driver exceeding the &quot;zero tolerance&quot; level, but can also occur from use by other drivers within legal limits, or from test anomalies. In some states, anomalies are routinely discounted, for example as not consistent with patterns of BAC levels or at levels incompatible with life (e.g., significant mouth alcohol - which as BAC would be fatal). In some states, &quot;fail&quot; readings not consistent with actual alcohol use can be cleared by a routine process, but other states automatically deem these &quot;fail&quot; readings as violations.

In operation, the driver blows into the IIDs to enable the car&#x27;s starter. After a variable time period of approximately 20–40 minutes, the driver is required to re-certify (blow again) within a time period consistent with safely pulling off the roadway. If the driver fails to re-certify within the time period, the car will alarm in a manner similar to setting off the car&#x27;s immobilizer (but mechanically independent of the immobilizer).

Various US states have different penalties for disabling IIDs. In some cases, the driver may be penalized if a family member or mechanic disables the IID when not in use by the sanctioned individual, or temporarily for servicing the vehicle. In some implementations, disabling by mechanics and others is either permitted or authorisation easily obtained, but some jurisdictions restrict or deny authorisation. (Such restrictions on mechanics can be problematic, for example, if limited to designated &quot;licensed mechanics&quot; or as applied to routine repair procedures requiring operation of the ignition and starter systems.) Some jurisdictions criminalize such temporary bypass of IIDs.

=====Universal IID installation=====
Proposals (none official) have been made to install IIDs on all new vehicles, set to the legal limit for the driver. Issues to be solved, besides consumer and voter acceptance, include difficulty in obtaining accurate measurements without inconvenience, and a need to achieve Six Sigma (6σ) reliability, in order to not interfere with vehicle usability.

There are no present plans to introduce universal IID installation in the US.

====Vehicle impoundment and forfeiture====
Some states, such as California, allow for the impoundment and forfeiture of vehicles under certain conditions.

==Investigation and arrest==
A drunk driving charge is a type of police arrest process, so a basic understanding of the process of police engagement is essential to understanding how that process applies to that process as applied to a drunk driving charge.

===Legal stages===
Following are common procedures when a law enforcement officer has reason to suspect a driver is intoxicated. While local procedures vary under the tens of thousands of courts in the US having traffic jurisdiction, the basic procedure is:

:1. reasonable suspicion
:2. probable cause
:3. arrest (including invoking the implied consent law)
:4. criminal charge and &quot;civil law&quot; sanctions

The legal stages are relevant because of the degree of evidence required at each stage. (For example, the police need not demonstrate guilt &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; in order to execute a traffic stop.)

===Investigation &quot;Phases&quot; (NHTSA)===
The investigation and NHTSA &quot;phases&quot; are distinct from the legal stages of the police arrest process. Instead, the investigation has, as its purpose, to take the process from initial contact through all of the evidence stages, through to prosecution. The primary goals are to:

* Identify impaired drivers;
* Establish clear &quot;probable cause for arrest&quot;, which is necessary to sustain the use of chemical test results in court. Without &quot;probable cause&quot;, the chemical test results are subject to the exclusionary rule
* Proceed to obtain proof of intoxication, typically using chemical test results.

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, police officers should conduct DUI Investigations according to a specific protocol called phases. According to the NHTSA training, DUI Investigations are categorized by these phases:
* Phase 1 - &quot;Vehicle in Motion&quot;
* Phase 2 - &quot;Personal Contact&quot;
* Phase 3 - &quot;Pre-Arrest Screening&quot;

The &quot;Vehicle in Motion&quot; Phase deals with the law enforcement officers&#x27; observations of the suspect&#x27;s driving maneuvers. The &quot;Personal Contact&quot; Phase is where the officer actually comes into contact with the suspected impaired driver. The &quot;Pre-Arrest Screening&quot; Phase is portion of the DUI Investigation that encompasses the Pre-Field Sobriety Test Questioning and the Field Sobriety Testing, including a Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test where applicable. This Phase also includes the post-arrest evidentiary chemical test despite that it occurs subsequent to a DUI arrest, not prior to a DUI arrest.

The officer will typically approach the driver&#x27;s window and ask some preliminary questions. During this phase of the stop, the officer will note if they detect any of the following indicators of intoxication:
*Odor of an alcoholic beverage on the driver&#x27;s breath or in the car generally
*Slurred speech in response to the questioning
*Watery, blood shot, or reddish eyes
*Flushed face
*Droopy eyelids
*Difficulty in understanding and responding intelligently to question
*Fumbling with his or her driver&#x27;s license and registration
*The plain-view presence of containers of alcoholic beverages in the vehicle
*Admission of consumption of alcoholic beverage

If the officer observes enough to have a reasonable suspicion to legally justify a further detention and investigation, they will ask the driver to step out of the vehicle, and request that the driver submit to voluntary field sobriety tests.

===Overall stop and arrest process===
&quot;Note: Local terminology will vary, but these general classifications fall under US Supreme Court guidelines.&quot;

Each stage has different requirements for establishing a basis for police or prosecutorial action. Without establishing that basis, the process is illegal and can cause a prosecution to fail under the exclusionary rule.

====1. Reasonable suspicion and traffic stop====
The police must have a reason to engage in a traffic stop. This typically involves either observing a traffic violation or observing behavior, such as weaving or lane departure, that would raise a &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; of driving while impaired. The police must have an articulable reason for the stop, but does not need probable cause for an arrest.

One exception is a roadblock (where legal). Roadblocks do not involve reasonable suspicion, but must meet particular legal standards to avoid arbitrariness while still assuring randomness.

During the traffic stop, the police will attempt to obtain sufficient evidence to support &quot;probable cause&quot;. This includes asking questions, and requesting further evidence or confession.

There are several situations in which the officer will come into contact with a driver, some examples are:

* The officer on patrol has observed erratic, suspicious driving, or a series of traffic infractions indicating the possibility that the driver may be impaired. This is by far the most common reason for stopping a suspect.
* A police officer has stopped a vehicle for a lesser traffic offense, notices the signs of intoxication, and begins the DUI investigation.
* The driver has been involved in an automobile collision; the officer has responded to the scene and is conducting an investigation.
* The driver has been stopped at a sobriety checkpoint (also known as roadblocks).
* The police have received a report, possibly from an anonymous citizen, that a described car has been driving erratically. The officer should verify the erratic driving before pulling the driver over. In some cases, the driver will no longer be in the vehicle.

The following list of DUI symptoms, from a publication issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (DOT HS-805-711), is widely used in training officers to detect drunk drivers. After each symptom is a percentage figure which, according to NHTSA, indicates the statistical chances through research that a driver is over the legal limit.

If the officer observes enough evidence to have a &quot;Reasonable Suspicion&quot; to legally justify a further detention and investigation, they will ask the driver to step out of the vehicle.

====2. Probable cause====
&quot;Probable cause&quot; is established by obtaining evidence from the police encounter sufficient to meet the &quot;probable cause&quot; standard for arrest. &quot;Probable cause&quot; is not necessarily sufficient to obtain a conviction, but is a prerequisite for arrest. Examples of &quot;probable cause&quot; for a drunk driving arrest includes:

:1. Observation
The NHTSA outlines several indicators of impairment, commonly referred to as “impairment cues.” These cues encompass behaviors like tightly gripping the steering wheel, driving with a closely positioned face to the windshield, slouching in the seat, and maintaining a fixed stare straight ahead. Certain officers regularly observe the facial expressions of drivers in opposing traffic, seeking signs of impairment.
:2. Confession of having consumed alcohol in the recent past. Relevant examples of confessions:
::* &quot;I had a glass of wine.&quot;
::* &quot;I was at a friend&#x27;s party.&quot;
::* &quot;I was at the Stone Balloon.&quot;
::The confession is the easiest way to establish &quot;probable cause&quot;, and police know that social convention encourages people to respond to police questions. &quot;While it is inadvisable to lie to police, the suspect has the option to &quot;respectfully decline&quot; to answer questions.&quot;
::The suspect is typically not given Miranda warnings at this time because the encounter legally has not gone from &quot;investigatory&quot; to &quot;accusatory&quot;, and because the police want the suspect to believe the questions are not being made to gather &quot;probable cause&quot; evidence. At this point, the suspect is not required to provide more than identification and vehicle information.
:3. Documented test results, such as
::* Preliminary breath test (PBT) evidence
::* Pseudo-scientific test results from field sobriety tests

====Field sobriety tests====


One of the most controversial aspects of a DUI stop is the field sobriety test (FSTs). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has developed a model system for managing Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) training.

=====Issues with FSTs=====
The NHTSA have published numerous training manuals associated with FSTs. As a result of the NHTSA studies, the walk-and-turn test was determined to be 68% accurate, and the one-leg stand test is only 65% accurate when administered to people within the study parameters. The tests were not validated for people with medical conditions, injuries, 65 years or older, and 50 pounds or greater overweight. The officer will administer one or more field sobriety tests. FSTs are considered &quot;divided attention tests&quot; that test the suspect&#x27;s ability to perform the type of mental and physical multitasking that is required to operate an automobile. However, these tests can be problematic for people with non-obvious disabilities affecting proprioception (the awareness of the body&#x27;s movement), such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

The three validated tests by NHTSA are:

# The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test, which involves following an object with the eyes (such as a pen) to determine characteristic eye movement reaction.
# The Walk-and-Turn Test (heel-to-toe in a straight line). This test is designed to measure a person&#x27;s ability to follow directions and remember a series of steps while dividing attention between physical and mental tasks.
# The One-Leg-Stand Test

According to NHTSA, these tests were not designed to measure impairment, but rather to give a probability that a driver is at or above a 0.08% BAC. However, studies have shown that there are reasons to doubt the tests&#x27; usefulness in helping an officer to make such a determination. In 1991, Dr. Spurgeon Cole of Clemson University conducted a study of the accuracy of FSTs. His staff videotaped people performing six common field sobriety tests, then showed the tapes to 14 police officers and asked them to decide whether the suspects had &quot;had too much to drink and drive&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;). The blood-alcohol concentration of each of the 21 DUI subjects was 0.00, unknown to the officers. The result: the officers gave their opinion that 46% of these innocent people were too drunk to be able to drive. This study showed the possible inaccuracy of FSTs.

Alternative tests, which have not been scientifically validated, include:

* Romberg test, or the Modified-Position-of-Attention Test, (feet together, head back, eyes closed for thirty seconds).
* The Finger-to-Nose Test (tip head back, eyes closed, touch the tip of nose with tip of index finger).
* The Alphabet Test (recite all or part of the alphabet).
* The Finger Count Test (touch each finger of hand to thumb counting with each touch (1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1)).
* The Counting Test (counting backwards from a number ending in a number other than 5 or 0 and stopping at a number ending other than 5 or 0. The series of numbers should be more than 15).
* The Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test, PAS Test or PBT, (breathe into a &quot;portable or preliminary breath tester&quot;, PAS Test or PBT).

=====Purpose=====
FSTs and SFSTs are promoted as, &quot;used to determine whether a subject is impaired&quot;, but FST tests are widely regarded having, as their primary purpose, establishing tangible evidence of &quot;probable cause for arrest&quot;. Probable cause is necessary under US law (4th Amendment) to sustain an arrest and (significantly) to invoke the implied consent law.

A secondary purpose is to provide supporting corroborative tangible evidence for use against the suspect for use at trial in jurisdictions that permit such evidence.

===== Field Sobriety Test Refusals =====

In all US jurisdictions, participation in a Field Sobriety Test (FST) is voluntary, and not required under implied consent laws. (Police are not obliged to advise the suspect that participation in a FST or other pre-arrest procedures is voluntary. In contrast, formal evidentiary tests given under implied consent requirements are considered mandatory.)

A suspect requested to participate in a FST is likely to be told that the purpose is to determine whether the suspect is impaired; however, FST tests are widely regarded having, as their primary purpose, gaining tangible evidence for use against the suspect in the establishment of probable cause for arrest.

====Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) or Preliminary Alcohol Screening test (PAS)====
An increasingly used field sobriety test involves having the suspect breathe into a small, handheld breath testing device. These are often referred to as PAS Tests, or &quot;Preliminary Alcohol Screening&quot; Tests&quot;, or a PBT, &quot;Preliminary Breath Test&quot; and precede the actual arrest and subsequent requirement to submit to an evidentiary chemical test of the suspect&#x27;s breath or blood. These breath testing devices used are smaller, inexpensive versions of the larger, more sophisticated instruments at the police stations, commonly known as an Evidentiary Breath Test using an EBT device, or Evidentiary Breath Test device. An increasing number jurisdictions began using Portable Evidentiary Breath Test devices, or PEBT devices, that are more sophisticated versions of the smaller, inexpensive versions of the larger, larger instruments at the police stations. Another distinction is that, while the larger EBTs usually employ infrared spectroscopy, the PEBT and PAS devices use a relatively simple electrochemical (fuel cell) technology. When used for purposes of a Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test, or PAS Test, their purpose, along with the other FSTs, is to assist the officer in determining whether he/she has probable cause for arrest.

The Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) or Preliminary Alcohol Screening test (PAS) is sometimes categorised as part of &quot;field sobriety testing&quot;, although it is not part of the series of performance tests. The PBT (or PAS) uses a portable breath tester. While the tester provides numerical blood alcohol content (BAC) readings, its primary use is for screening and establishing probable cause for arrest, to invoke the implied consent requirements. In US law, this is necessary to sustain a conviction based on evidential testing (or implied consent refusal). Regardless of the terminology, in order to sustain a conviction based on evidential tests, &quot;probable cause&quot; must be shown (or the suspect must volunteer to take the evidential test without implied consent requirements being invoked).

Police are not obliged to advise the suspect that participation in a FST or other pre-arrest procedures is voluntary. In contrast, formal evidentiary tests given under implied consent requirements are considered mandatory.

Refusal to take a preliminary breath test (PBT) in Michigan subjects a non-commercial driver to a &quot;civil infraction&quot; penalty, with no violation &quot;points&quot;, but is not considered to be a refusal under the general &quot;implied consent&quot; law. In some states, the state may present evidence of refusal to take a field sobriety test in court, although this is of questionable probative value in a drunk driving prosecution.

Different requirements apply in many states to drivers under DUI probation, in which case participation in a preliminary breath test (PBT) may be a condition of probation, and for commercial drivers under &quot;drug screening&quot; requirements. Some US states, notably California, have statutes on the books penalizing PBT refusal for drivers under 21; however the Constitutionality of those statutes has not been tested. (As a practical matter, most criminal lawyers advise not engaging in discussion or &quot;justifying&quot; a refusal with the police.)

====3. Arrest (including invoking the implied consent law)====

=====Probable cause for arrest=====
If the officer has sufficient probable cause that the suspect has been driving under the influence of alcohol, they will make the arrest, handcuff the suspect and transport them to the police station. En route, the officer may advise them of their legal implied consent obligation to submit to an evidentiary chemical test of blood, breath or possibly urine depending on the jurisdiction.

Laws relating to what exactly constitutes probable cause vary from state to state. In California it is a refutable presumption that a person with a BAC of 0.08% or higher is driving under the influence. However, section 23610(a)(2) of the California Vehicle Code states that driving with a BAC between 0.05% and 0.08% &quot;shall not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of an alcoholic beverage&quot;.

====Chemical test====
An arrestee will be offered a chemical test of breath, blood or, much less frequently, urine. Breath test results are usually available immediately; urine and blood samples are sent to a lab for later analysis to determine the BAC or possible presence of drugs. Some states sought to impose criminal punishment for a refusal to submit to a chemical test of their breath or blood; however, in &quot;Birchfield v. North Dakota&quot;, the United States Supreme Court visited the issue of whether states can criminalize a refusal to submit to a chemical test. The United States Supreme Court decided that states may criminalize a refusal to submit to a breath test; but not a refusal to submit to a blood test absent a McNeely warrant, named after &quot;Missouri v. McNeely&quot; (2013). This was a case decided by United States Supreme Court, on appeal from the Supreme Court of Missouri, regarding exceptions to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution under exigent circumstances. The United States Supreme Court ruled that police must generally obtain a warrant before subjecting a drunken-driving suspect to a blood test, and that the natural metabolism of blood alcohol does not establish a per se exigency that would justify a blood draw without consent.

Regarding blood tests, some commentators, such as Brown University&#x27;s Jacob Appel, have criticized the role of medical personnel in this process. According to Appel, &quot;If physicians acquiesce today in the removal of a resistant patient&#x27;s blood, soon they may be called upon to pump the contents of an unwilling patient&#x27;s stomach or even to perform involuntary surgery to retrieve an evidentiary bullet.&quot;

While chemical tests are used to determine the driver&#x27;s BAC, they do not determine the driver&#x27;s level of impairment. However, state laws usually provide for a rebuttable legal presumption of intoxication at a BAC of 0.08% or higher (see blood alcohol test assumptions).

====4. Criminal charge, and &quot;civil law&quot; sanctions====
=====Booking and charging=====
If it is determined after arrest that the person&#x27;s BAC is not at or above the legal limit of 0.08%, they will probably be released without any charges. One may, however, still be charged with driving under the influence of alcohol on the basis of driving symptoms, observed impairment, admissions or performance on the field sobriety tests. And if there is suspicion of drug usage, a blood or urine test is likely, or at least the testimony of a specially trained officer called a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE). Assuming sufficient evidence of impaired driving from drugs, the arrested may face charges of driving under the influence of drugs or the combined influence of alcohol and drugs.

Most of the time, the driver will either be kept in a holding cell (sometimes referred to as the &quot;drunk tank&quot;) until they are deemed sober enough to be released on bail or on his &quot;own recognizance&quot; (OR). A date to appear in court for an arraignment will be given to them. If they cannot make bail or is not granted OR, they will be kept in jail to wait for the arraignment on remand.

==Cost of an impaired driving charge==
In the United States, paying the DUI ticket, court costs, and attorney fees is just the start of a person&#x27;s financial obligations after a DUI conviction. Additional costs of a DUI conviction will often involve the installation and maintenance fees of a vehicle Ignition Interlock Device, which serves the same function as a Breathalyzer to enable the vehicle to start. A person convicted of a driving under the influence charge, can also expect to pay higher insurance rates and premiums. In addition, DUI records prevent entry into Canada without proper documentation.

==Prevention==
Drunk driving is a public health concern in the United States, and reducing its frequency may require an integrated community-based approach utilizing sanctions and treatments. Several intervention programs have been developed, such as the Paradigm Developmental Model of Treatment (PDMT), a program encouraging a paradigm shift in the offender&#x27;s view of oneself and the world.

The National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism suggests environmental interventions to help eliminate drinking and driving all together.

==Flying and boating under the influence==
Federal Aviation Regulation 91.17 () prohibits pilots from flying aircraft with an alcohol level of 0.04% or more, or within eight hours of consuming alcohol (&quot;eight hours, bottle to throttle&quot;), or while under the impairing influence of any drug. The same prohibition applies to any other crew members on duty aboard the aircraft (flight attendants, etc.). Some airlines impose additional restrictions, and many pilots also impose stricter standards upon themselves. Commercial pilots found to be in violation of regulations are typically fired or resign voluntarily, and they may lose their pilot certificates and be subject to criminal prosecution under Federal or State laws, effectively ending their careers.

Similar laws apply to other activities involving transportation; Michigan prohibits intoxicated use of motorized farm implements, or boating, the latter whether a pilot or passenger, with much the same threshold of intoxication. In the case of boating, the laws extend to include kayaks, canoes, sailboats—any flotation device that needs to be steered in water. Different states have different laws and classifications on the level of transgression attached to a citation for boating under the influence. For example, Virginia has very similar penalties for a BUI as it does for a DUI. Those convicted of boating while intoxicated face penalties including, fines of up to $2,500, jail time of up to one year, loss of one&#x27;s operator&#x27;s license for up to three years and mandatory enrollment and completion of a Virginia Alcohol Safety Action Program.

Alcohol use was the number one contributing factor in U.S. recreational boating deaths between 2003 and 2012, accounting for 15 percent of the fatalities in 2003, and 17 percent in 2012. A Canadian study published in 2011 examined 18 years of data on recreational boating, and concluded that a &quot;true figure&quot; of alcohol-related deaths in that country &quot;may lie between 46% and 56%&quot;.

==International comparisons==
In countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia drunk driving and deaths caused by drunk driving are considerably lower than in the United States. Drunk driving deaths in the UK (population 61 million, 31 million cars) were 380 in 2010 (21% of all fatal crashes). In California (population 36 million, 32 million cars) there were 950 deaths from traffic crashes involving drivers with a Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) of 0.08 or greater) in 2009 (31% of all fatal collisions). Alcohol consumption per capita in the UK and Australia is higher than in the United States and the legal age for drinking lower.

Research in the United Kingdom has shown that the danger group for drunk driving is young men in their early 20s rather than teenagers. It is not uncommon for police forces in Australia to randomly stop motorists, typically at a checkpoint, and submit them to a random breath test. This test involves speaking or blowing into a hand held breathalyzer to give a reading, if this is over the legal limit, the driver will be arrested, and required to perform a test on another breathalyzer, which can be used for a conviction. Refusing a roadside or evidential test is an offense, and is subject to the same penalty as high range drunk driving. This detection method is not employed in the UK, and it is not an offence in England, Wales or Australia for a fully licensed driver to drive with a BAC of less than 0.08% (Australia and Scotland have limits of 0.05%), however in Australia this detection, even if under the legal limit, may still result in a penalty if there is an open container of alcohol in the vehicle. In Australia it is an offence for any learner or probationary driver to drive with a BAC above 0.00%. In addition, anyone instructing or supervising a learner driver must have a BAC of under 0.05%.

Unlike the United States, these countries do not see restricting access to alcohol as having any useful role to play in reducing drunk driving. Their experience is that random breath tests, severe penalties, including potential imprisonment for a first offense (in UK), combined with blanket public service broadcasting are a more effective strategy.

Also, Australian and British law do not recognize the crime of DUI manslaughter, and sentences for causing death by drunk driving are much lower than the United States. In the UK, a judge makes a sentencing decision based on the amount of alcohol present. This can lead to imprisonment for a first offence.

In Germany, a legal limit of 0.05% lowers to 0.03% if a driver is found to be at fault in a traffic crash. 0.00% is the standard for those who are under 21 years of age.

<text>Uluru (; ), also known as Ayers Rock ( ) and officially gazetted as UluruAyers Rock, is a large sandstone monolith. It crops out near the centre of Australia in the southern part of the Northern Territory, south-west of Alice Springs.

Uluru is sacred to the Pitjantjatjara, the Aboriginal people of the area, known as the Aṉangu. The area around the formation is home to an abundance of springs, waterholes, rock caves and ancient paintings. Uluru is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Uluru and Kata Tjuta, also known as the Olgas, are the two major features of the Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park.

Uluru is one of Australia&#x27;s most recognisable natural landmarks and has been a popular destination for tourists since the late 1930s. It is also one of the most important indigenous sites in Australia.

==Name==
The local Aṉangu, the Pitjantjatjara people, call the landmark &quot;Uluṟu&quot; (). This word is a proper noun, with no further particular meaning in the Pitjantjatjara dialect, although it is used as a local family name by the senior traditional owners of Uluru.

On 19 July 1873, the surveyor William Gosse sighted the landmark and named it Ayers Rock in honour of the then Chief Secretary of South Australia, Sir Henry Ayers.

In 1993, a dual naming policy was adopted that allowed official names that consist of both the traditional Aboriginal name (in the Pitjantjatjara, Yankunytjatjara and other local languages) and the English name. On 15 December 1993, it was renamed &quot;Ayers Rock / Uluru&quot; and became the first official dual-named feature in the Northern Territory. The order of the dual names was officially reversed to &quot;Uluru / Ayers Rock&quot; on 6 November 2002 following a request from the Regional Tourism Association in Alice Springs.

==Description==
The sandstone formation stands high, rising above sea level with most of its bulk lying underground, and has a total perimeter of . Uluru is notable for appearing to change colour at different times of the day and year, most notably when it glows red at dawn and sunset. The reddish colour in the rock derives from iron oxide in the sandstone.

Kata Tjuta, also called Mount Olga or the Olgas, lies west of Uluru. Special viewing areas with road access and parking have been constructed to give tourists the best views of both sites at dawn and dusk.

Both Uluru and the nearby Kata Tjuta formation have great cultural significance for the local Aṉangu people, the traditional inhabitants of the area, who lead walking tours to inform visitors about the bush, food, local flora and fauna, and the Aboriginal Dreamtime stories of the area.

==History==
===Early settlement===
Archaeological findings to the east and west indicate that humans settled in the area more than 10,000 years ago.

===Arrival of Europeans (1870s)===
Europeans arrived in the Australian Western Desert in the 1870s. Uluru and Kata Tjuta were first mapped by Europeans in 1872 during the expeditionary period, which was made possible by the construction of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line. In separate expeditions, Ernest Giles and William Gosse were the first European explorers to this area. While exploring the area in 1872, Giles sighted Kata Tjuta from a location near Kings Canyon and called it Mount Olga, while the following year Gosse observed Uluru and named it Ayers&#x27; Rock, in honour of the Chief Secretary of South Australia, Sir Henry Ayers.

Further explorations followed with the aim of establishing the possibilities of the area for pastoralism. In the late 19th century, pastoralists attempted to establish themselves in areas adjoining the Southwestern/Petermann Reserve and interaction between Aṉangu and white people became more frequent and more violent. Due to the effects of grazing and drought, bush food stores became depleted. Competition for these resources created conflict between the two groups, resulting in more frequent police patrols. Later, during the depression in the 1930s, Aṉangu became involved in dingo scalping with &#x27;doggers&#x27; who introduced the Aṉangu to European foods and ways.

===Aboriginal reserve (1920)===
Between 1918 and 1921, large adjoining areas of South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory were declared as Aboriginal reserves, government-run settlements where the Aboriginal people were forced to live. In 1920, part of Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park was declared an Aboriginal Reserve (commonly known as the South-Western or Petermann Reserve) by the Australian government under the &quot;Aboriginals Ordinance 1918&quot;.
===Tourism (1936–1960s)===
The first tourists arrived in the Uluru area in 1936. Permanent European settlement of the area began in the 1940s under Aboriginal welfare policy and to promote tourism at Uluru. This increased tourism prompted the formation of the first vehicular tracks in 1948 and tour bus services began early in the 1950s. In 1958, the area that would become the Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park was excised from the Petermann Reserve; it was placed under the management of the Northern Territory Reserves Board and named the Ayers Rock–Mount Olga National Park. The first ranger was Bill Harney, a well-recognised central Australian figure. By 1959, the first motel leases had been granted and Eddie Connellan had constructed an airstrip close to the northern side of Uluru. Following a 1963 suggestion from the Northern Territory Reserves Board, a chain was laid to assist tourists in climbing the landmark. The chain was removed in 2019.

===Aboriginal ownership since 1985===
On 26 October 1985, the Australian government returned ownership of Uluru to the local Pitjantjatjara people, with a condition that the Aṉangu would lease it back to the National Parks and Wildlife agency for 99 years and that it would be jointly managed. An agreement originally made between the community and Prime Minister Bob Hawke that the climb to the top by tourists would be stopped was later broken.

The Aboriginal community of Mutitjulu, with a population of approximately 300, is located near the eastern end of Uluru. From Uluru it is by road to the tourist town of Yulara, population 3,000, which is situated just outside the national park.

On 8 October 2009, the Talinguru Nyakuntjaku viewing area opened to public visitation. The project about on the east side of Uluru involved design and construction supervision by the Aṉangu traditional owners of of roads and of walking trails.

==Tourism==

The development of tourism infrastructure adjacent to the base of Uluru that began in the 1950s soon produced adverse environmental impacts. It was decided in the early 1970s to remove all accommodation-related tourist facilities and re-establish them outside the park. In 1975, a reservation of of land beyond the park&#x27;s northern boundary, from Uluru, was approved for the development of a tourist facility and an associated airport, to be known as Yulara.

In 1983, the Ayers Rock Campground opened, followed by the Four Seasons Hotel (later renamed Voyages Desert Gardens Hotel) and the Sheraton Hotel (Voyages Sails in the Desert) in 1984. The town square, bank and primary school were also established. After the Commonwealth Government handed the national park back to its traditional owners in 1985, management of the park was transferred from the Northern Territory Government to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service the following year. In July 1992, Yulara Development Company was dissolved and the Ayers Rock Resort Company was established, after which all hotels came under the same management.

Since the park was listed as a World Heritage Site, annual visitor numbers rose to over 400,000 visitors by 2000. Increased tourism provides regional and national economic benefits. It also presents an ongoing challenge to balance conservation of cultural values and visitor needs.

===Climbing===

The local Aṉangu do not climb Uluru because of its great spiritual significance. They have in the past requested that visitors not climb the rock, partly due to the path crossing a sacred traditional Dreamtime track, and also due to a sense of responsibility for the safety of visitors. Until October 2019, the visitors&#x27; guide said &quot;the climb is not prohibited, but we prefer that, as a guest on Aṉangu land, you will choose to respect our law and culture by not climbing&quot;.

On 11 December 1983, the Prime Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke, promised to hand back the land title to the Aṉangu traditional custodians and caretakers and agreed to the community&#x27;s 10-point plan which included forbidding the climbing of Uluru. The government set access to climb Uluru and a 99-year lease, instead of the previously agreed upon 50-year lease, as conditions before the title was officially given back to the Aṉangu on 26 October 1985.

A chain handhold, added to the rock in 1964 and extended in 1976, made the hour-long climb easier, but it remained a steep, hike to the top, where it can be quite windy. It was recommended that individuals drink plenty of water while climbing, and that those who were unfit, or who suffered from vertigo or medical conditions restricting exercise, did not attempt it. Climbing Uluru was generally closed to the public when high winds were present at the top. As of July 2018, 37 deaths related to recreational climbing have been recorded.

According to a 2010 publication, just over one-third of all visitors to the park climbed Uluru; a high percentage of these were children. About one-sixth of visitors made the climb between 2011 and 2015.

The traditional owners of Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park (Nguraritja) and the Federal Government&#x27;s Director of National Parks share decision-making on the management of Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park. Under their joint Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park Management Plan 2010–20, issued by the Director of National Parks under the &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot;, clause 6.3.3 provides that the Director and the Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa Board of Management should work to close the climb upon meeting any of three conditions: there were &quot;adequate new visitor experiences&quot;, less than 20 per cent of visitors made the climb, or the &quot;critical factors&quot; in decisions to visit were &quot;cultural and natural experiences&quot;. Despite cogent evidence that the second condition was met by July 2013, the climb remained open.

Several controversial incidents on top of Uluru in 2010, including a striptease, golfing and nudity, led to renewed calls for banning the climb. On 1 November 2017, the Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park board voted unanimously to prohibit climbing Uluru. As a result, there was a surge in climbers and visitors after the ban was announced. The ban took effect on 26 October 2019, and the guide chains that aided climbers were removed.

A November 2017 &quot;NT News&quot; poll found that 63% of respondents did not support the ban. A 2019 Essential poll found that 44% supported the ban, while 30% opposed it.

===Photography===

The Aṉangu request that visitors do not photograph certain sections of Uluru, for reasons related to traditional &quot;Tjukurpa&quot; (Dreaming) beliefs. These areas are the sites of gender-linked rituals or ceremonies and are forbidden ground for Aṉangu of the opposite sex to those participating in the rituals in question. The photographic restriction is intended to prevent Aṉangu from inadvertently violating this taboo by encountering photographs of the forbidden sites in the outside world.

In September 2020, Parks Australia alerted Google Australia to the user-generated images from the Uluru summit that have been posted on the Google Maps platform and requested that the content be removed in accordance with the wishes of Aṉangu, Uluru&#x27;s traditional owners, and the national park&#x27;s Film and Photography Guidelines. Google agreed to the request.

=== Waterfalls ===
During heavy rain, which is rare in the region, ephemeral waterfalls cascade down the sides of Uluru. Large rainfall events occurred in 2016, and the summer of 2020–21.

==Geology==

Uluru is an inselberg. An inselberg is a prominent isolated residual knob or hill that rises abruptly from and is surrounded by extensive and relatively flat erosion lowlands in a hot, dry region. Uluru is also often referred to as a monolith, although this is an ambiguous term that is generally avoided by geologists.

Uluru&#x27;s homogeneity and lack of jointing and parting at bedding surfaces inhibits the development of scree slopes and soil. These characteristics led to its survival, while the surrounding rocks were eroded.

For the purpose of mapping and describing the geological history of the area, geologists refer to the rock strata making up Uluru as the Mutitjulu Arkose, and it is one of many sedimentary formations filling the Amadeus Basin.

===Composition===
Uluru is dominantly composed of coarse-grained arkose (a type of sandstone characterised by an abundance of feldspar) and some conglomerate. Average composition is 50% feldspar, 25–35% quartz and up to 25% rock fragments; most feldspar is K-feldspar with only minor plagioclase as subrounded grains and highly altered inclusions within K-feldspar. The grains are typically in diameter, and are angular to subangular; the finer sandstone is well sorted, with sorting decreasing with increasing grain size. The rock fragments include subrounded basalt, invariably replaced to various degrees by chlorite and epidote. The minerals present suggest derivation from a predominantly granite source, similar to the Musgrave Block exposed to the south. When relatively fresh, the rock has a grey colour, but weathering of iron-bearing minerals by the process of oxidation gives the outer surface layer of rock a red-brown rusty colour. Features related to deposition of the sediment include cross-bedding and ripples, analysis of which indicated deposition from broad shallow high energy fluvial channels and sheet flooding, typical of alluvial fans.

===Age and origin===

The Mutitjulu Arkose is about the same age as the conglomerate at Kata Tjuta, and has a similar origin, despite the different rock type. It is younger than the rocks exposed to the east at Mount Conner, and unrelated to them. The strata at Uluru are nearly vertical, dipping to the south-west at 85°, and have an exposed thickness of at least . The strata dip below the surrounding plain and no doubt extend well beyond Uluru in the subsurface, but the extent is not known.

The rock was originally sand, deposited as part of an extensive alluvial fan that extended out from the ancestors of the Musgrave, Mann and Petermann Ranges to the south and west, but separate from a nearby fan that deposited the sand, pebbles and cobbles that now make up Kata Tjuta.

The similar mineral composition of the Mutitjulu Arkose and the granite ranges to the south is now explained. The ancestors of the ranges to the south were once much larger than the eroded remnants we see today. They were thrust up during a mountain building episode referred to as the Petermann Orogeny that took place in late Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian times (550–530 Ma), and thus the Mutitjulu Arkose is believed to have been deposited at about the same time, hence then in Gondwana (now in Australia).

The arkose sandstone that makes up the formation is composed of grains that show little sorting based on grain size and exhibit very little rounding; the feldspars in the rock are relatively fresh in appearance. This lack of sorting and grain rounding is typical of arkosic sandstones and is indicative of relatively rapid erosion from the granites of the growing mountains to the south. The layers of sand were nearly horizontal when deposited, but were tilted to their near vertical position during a later episode of mountain building, possibly the Alice Springs Orogeny of Palaeozoic age (400–300 Ma).

==Aboriginal myths, legends and traditions==
As with many sites around Australia, there are stories from The Dreaming associated with Uluru that date back thousands of years. According to the Aṉangu, traditional landowners of Uluru:
===Creation of the rock===
There are a number of differing accounts given, by outsiders, of Aboriginal ancestral stories for the origins of Uluru and its many cracks and fissures. One such account, taken from Robert Layton&#x27;s (1989) &quot;Uluru: An Aboriginal history of Ayers Rock&quot;, reads as follows:
Two other accounts are given in Norbert Brockman&#x27;s (1997) &quot;Encyclopedia of Sacred Places&quot;. The first tells of serpents who waged many wars around Uluru, scarring the rock. The second tells of two tribes of ancestral spirits who were invited to a feast, but were distracted by the beautiful Sleepy Lizard Women and did not show up. In response, the angry hosts sang evil into a mud sculpture that came to life as the dingo. There followed a great battle, which ended in the deaths of the leaders of both tribes. The earth itself rose up in grief at the bloodshed, becoming Uluru.

===Other stories===
The Commonwealth Department of Environment&#x27;s webpage advises:
It is sometimes reported that those who take rocks from the formation will be cursed and suffer misfortune. There have been many instances where people who removed such rocks attempted to mail them back to various agencies in an attempt to remove the perceived curse.

====Mala story====

One of the major stories associated with Uluru is the Mala story. In this, the Mala (rufous hare-wallaby) people came from the north, and decided to stay at Uluru for a while, and perform the ceremony known as inma. The men decorated and raised the ceremonial pole (&quot;Ngaltawata&quot;) and began inma, while the women gathered and prepared bush food, storing seed cakes (&quot;nyuma&quot;) in their caves. The men hunted, made fires, and fixed their tools and weapons. Two Wintalka men approached from the west, and invited the Mala people to attend their inma, but the Mala people declined the invitation, as their inma had begun and could not be stopped. The Wintalka men went back and told their people, who got angry and created an evil spirit, in the form of an enormous devil-dog called Kurpany, in order to wreck the Mala inma. Kurpany approached the Mala people, changing form as he did so, including taking the form of a ghost (&quot;mamu&quot;). Luunpa (the kingfisher woman) spied him first, and warned the Mala people; however, they did not listen to her. Kurpany attacked and killed some of the men, and the remaining Mala people fled southwards, into what is now the state of South Australia, with Kurpany in pursuit. This story continues among the Indigenous peoples of South Australia.

Aṉangu believe that the ancestors still exist at Uluru today. Luunpa, now a large rock, keeps watch, while the men killed by Kurpany are still in their cave. Kurpany&#x27;s footprints, heading eastwards and southwards, are still in the rock. The teaching from this story is that people need to heed warnings of danger, and to finish what they have begun.

==Flora and fauna==

Historically, 46 species of native mammals are known to have been living near Uluru; according to recent surveys there are currently 21. Aṉangu acknowledge that a decrease in the number has implications for the condition and health of the landscape. Moves are supported for the reintroduction of locally extinct animals such as malleefowl, common brushtail possum, rufous hare-wallaby or mala, bilby, burrowing bettong and the black-flanked rock-wallaby.
The mulgara is mostly restricted to the transitional sand plain area, a narrow band of country that stretches from the vicinity of Uluru to the northern boundary of the park and into Ayers Rock Resort. This area also contains the marsupial mole, woma python and great desert skink.

The bat population of the park comprises at least seven species that depend on day roosting sites within caves and crevices of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Most of the bats forage for aerial prey within or so from the rock face. The park has a very rich reptile fauna of high conservation significance, with 73 species having been reliably recorded. Four species of frogs are abundant at the base of Uluru and Kata Tjuta following summer rains. The great desert skink is listed as vulnerable.

Aṉangu continue to hunt and gather animal species in remote areas of the park and on Aṉangu land elsewhere. Hunting is largely confined to the red kangaroo, bush turkey, emu and lizards such as the sand goanna and perentie.

Of the 27 mammal species found in the park, six are introduced: the house mouse, camel, fox, cat, dog and rabbit. These species are distributed throughout the park, but their densities are greatest near the rich water run-off areas of Uluru and Kata Tjuta.

Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park flora represents a large portion of plants found in Central Australia. A number of these species are considered rare and restricted in the park or the immediate region. Many rare and endemic plants are found in the park.

The growth and reproduction of plant communities rely on irregular rainfall. Some plants are able to survive fire and some are dependent on it to reproduce. Plants are an important part of &quot;Tjukurpa&quot;, and ceremonies are held for each of the major plant foods. Many plants are associated with ancestors.

Flora in Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park can be broken into these categories:
* – trees
* – shrubs
* – flowers
* – grasses

Trees such as the mulga and centralian bloodwood are used to make tools such as spearheads, boomerangs and bowls. The red sap of the bloodwood is used as a disinfectant and an inhalant for coughs and colds.

Several rare and endangered species are found in the park. Most of them, like adder&#x27;s tongue ferns, are restricted to the moist areas at the base of the formation, which are areas of high visitor use and subject to erosion.

Since the first Europeans arrived, 34 exotic plant species have been recorded in the park, representing about 6.4% of the total park flora. Some, such as perennial buffel grass (&quot;Cenchrus ciliaris&quot;), were introduced to rehabilitate areas damaged by erosion. It is the most threatening weed in the park and has spread to invade water- and nutrient-rich drainage lines. A few others, such as burrgrass, were brought in accidentally, carried on cars and people.

==Climate and five seasons==
The park has a hot desert climate and receives an average rainfall of per year. The average high temperature in summer (December–January) is , and the average low temperature in winter (June–July) is . Temperature extremes in the park have been recorded at during summer and during winter. UV levels are extreme between October and March, averaging between 11 and 15 on the UV index.

Local Aboriginal people recognise five seasons:
# Wanitjunkupai (April/May) – Cooler weather
# Wari (June/July) – Cold season bringing morning frosts
# Piriyakutu (August/September/October) – Animals breed and food plants flower
# Mai Wiyaringkupai (November/December) – The hot season when food becomes scarce
# Itjanu (January/February/March) – Sporadic storms can roll in suddenly

<text>Manumission, or enfranchisement, is the act of freeing slaves by their owners. Different approaches to manumission were developed, each specific to the time and place of a particular society. Historian Verene Shepherd states that the most widely used term is gratuitous manumission, &quot;the conferment of freedom on the enslaved by enslavers before the end of the slave system&quot;.

The motivations for manumission were complex and varied. Firstly, it may present itself as a sentimental and benevolent gesture. One typical scenario was the freeing in the master&#x27;s will of a devoted servant after long years of service. A trusted bailiff might be manumitted as a gesture of gratitude. For those working as agricultural labourers or in workshops, there was little likelihood of being so noticed. In general, it was more common for older slaves to be given freedom.

Legislation under the early Roman Empire put limits on the number of slaves that could be freed in wills (&quot;lex Fufia Caninia&quot;, 2 BC), which suggests that it had been widely used. Freeing slaves could serve the pragmatic interests of the owner. The prospect of manumission worked as an incentive for slaves to be industrious and compliant. Roman slaves were paid a wage (&quot;&quot;), which they could save up to buy themselves freedom. Manumission contracts, found in some abundance at Delphi (Greece), specify in detail the prerequisites for liberation.

==Ancient Greece==

&quot;A History of Ancient Greece&quot; explains that in the context of Ancient Greece, affranchisement came in many forms. A master choosing to free his slave would most likely do so only &quot;at his death, specifying his desire in his will&quot;. In rare cases, slaves who were able to earn enough money in their labour were able to buy their own freedom and were known as &quot;choris oikointes&quot;. Two 4th-century bankers, Pasion and Phormion, had been slaves before they bought their freedom. A slave could also be sold fictitiously to a sanctuary from where a god could enfranchise him. In very rare circumstances, the city could affranchise a slave. A notable example is that Athens liberated everyone who was present at the Battle of Arginusae (406 BC).

Even once a slave was freed, he was not generally permitted to become a citizen, but would become a metic. The master then became the metic&#x27;s &quot;prostatès&quot; (guarantor or guardian). The former slave could be bound to some continuing duty to the master and was commonly required to live near the former master (&quot;paramone&quot;). Ex-slaves were able to own property outright, and their children were free of all constraint.

==Ancient Rome==
Under Roman law, a slave had no personhood and was protected under law mainly as his or her master&#x27;s property. In Ancient Rome, a slave who had been manumitted was a &quot;libertus&quot; (feminine &quot;liberta&quot;) and a citizen. Manumissions were subject to a state tax.
The soft felt &quot;pileus&quot; hat was a symbol of the freed slave and manumission; slaves were not allowed to wear them:

The cap was an attribute carried by Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom, who was also recognized by the rod (&quot;vindicta&quot; or &quot;festuca&quot;), used ceremonially in the act of &quot;manumissio vindicta&quot;, Latin for &quot;freedom by the rod&quot; (emphasis added):

A freed slave customarily took the former owner&#x27;s family name, which was the &quot;nomen&quot; (see Roman naming conventions) of the master&#x27;s &quot;gens&quot;. The former owner became the patron (&quot;patronus&quot;) and the freed slave became a client (&quot;cliens&quot;) and retained certain obligations to the former master, who owed certain obligations in return. A freed slave could also acquire multiple patrons.

A freed slave became a citizen. Not all citizens, however, held the same freedoms and privileges. In particular contrast, women could become citizens, but female Roman citizenship did not allow anywhere near the same protections, independence, or rights as men, either in the public or private spheres. In reflection of unwritten, yet strictly enforced contemporary social codes, women were also legally prevented from participating in public and civic society. For example: through the illegality of women voting or holding public office.

The freed slaves&#x27; rights were limited or defined by particular statutes. A freed male slave could become a civil servant but not hold higher magistracies (see, for instance, &quot;apparitor&quot; and &quot;scriba&quot;), serve as priests of the emperor or hold any of the other highly respected public positions.

If they were sharp at business, however, there were no social limits to the wealth that freedmen could amass. Their children held full legal rights, but Roman society was stratified. Famous Romans who were the sons of freedmen include the Augustan poet Horace and the 2nd century emperor, Pertinax.

A notable freedman in Latin literature is Trimalchio, the ostentatiously &quot;nouveau riche&quot; character in the &quot;Satyricon&quot;, by Petronius.

==Peru==
In colonial Peru, the laws around manumission were influenced by the &quot;Siete Partidas&quot;, a Castilian law code. According to the &quot;Siete Partidas&quot;, masters who manumitted their slaves should be honored and obeyed by their former slaves for giving such a generous gift. As in other parts of Latin America under the system of &quot;coartación&quot;, slaves could purchase their freedom by negotiating with their master for a purchase price and this was the most common way for slaves to be freed. Manumission also occurred during baptism, or as part of an owner&#x27;s last will and testament.

In baptismal manumission, enslaved children were freed at baptism. Many of these freedoms came with stipulations which could include servitude often until the end of an owner&#x27;s life. Children freed at baptism were also frequently the children of still-enslaved parents. A child who was freed at baptism but continued to live with enslaved family was far more likely to be re-enslaved. Baptismal manumission could be used as evidence of a person&#x27;s freed status in a legal case but they did not always have enough information to serve as a &quot;carta de libertad&quot;.

Female slave owners were more likely than males to manumit their slaves at baptism. The language used by women slave owners who freed their slaves also differed substantially from that of men, with many women using the phrasing “for the love I have for her” as well as other expressions of intimacy as part of the reasoning for freeing their slaves as written on the baptismal record or &quot;carta de libertad&quot;. Male slave owners were far less likely to speak in intimate terms about their reasoning for freeing their slaves.

Many children manumitted at baptism were likely the illegitimate children of their male owners, though this can be difficult to determine from the baptismal record and must be assessed through other evidence. Although slave owners often characterized these baptismal manumissions as a result of their generous beneficence, there are records of payments by parents or godparents to ensure the child&#x27;s freedom. Mothers were almost never manumitted alongside their children, even when the mothers gave birth to their master&#x27;s own children. Manumitting a slave&#x27;s children at baptism could be one way for owners to ensure the loyalty of the children&#x27;s still-enslaved parents.

Enslaved people could also be freed as part of a slave owner&#x27;s last will and testament. Testamentary manumission frequently involved expressions of affection on the part of the slave owner to the enslaved person as part of the rationale behind manumission. Slave owners also frequently cited a desire to die with a clear conscience as part of their reasoning for freeing their slaves. Testamentary manumission could often be disputed by heirs claiming fraud, or that an enslaved person had preyed upon a relative&#x27;s weak mental or physical condition. Legally testamentary manumissions were usually respected by the courts, who understood enslaved people as part of their owner&#x27;s property to distribute as they wished. Relatives who claimed fraud had to provide evidence of their claims or they would be dismissed. As in baptismal manumission, conditions of ongoing servitude were sometimes placed upon the enslaved person, by obligating them to care for another relative.

In Iberoamerican law, a person had discretion over one-fifth of their estate with the rest going to children, spouses, and other relatives. An enslaved person could be sold in order to cover debts of the estate, but not if they had already paid part of their purchase price towards manumission as this was considered a legally binding agreement. As long as a person had not disinherited his children or spouse, a slave owner could manumit their slaves as they wished.

==Caribbean==
Manumission laws varied between the various colonies in the Caribbean. For instance, the island of Barbados had some of the strictest laws, requiring owners to pay £200 for male slaves and £300 for female slaves, and show cause to the authorities. In some other colonies, no fees applied. It was not uncommon for ex-slaves to purchase family members or friends in order to free them. For example, ex-slave Susannah Ostrehan became a successful businesswoman in Barbados and purchased many of her acquaintances.

For Jamaica, manumission went largely unregulated until the 1770s, when manumitters had to post a bond in order to ensure those that they freed did not become wards of the parish. One quantitative analysis of the Jamaica manumission deeds shows that manumission was comparatively rare on the island around 1770, with only an estimated 165 slaves winning their freedom through this fashion. While manumission had little demographic impact on the size of the enslaved population, it was important to the growth and development of the free population of colour, in Jamaica, during the second half of the eighteenth century.

==United States==
African slaves were freed in the North American colonies as early as the 17th century. Some, such as Anthony Johnson, went on to become landowners and slaveholders themselves. Slaves could sometimes arrange manumission by agreeing to &quot;purchase themselves&quot; by paying the master an agreed amount. Some masters demanded market rates; others set a lower amount in consideration of service.
Regulation of manumission began in 1692, when Virginia established that to manumit a slave, a person must pay the cost for them to be transported out of the colony. A 1723 law stated that slaves may not &quot;be set free upon any pretence whatsoever, except for some meritorious services to be adjudged and allowed by the governor and council&quot;.

In some cases, a master who was drafted into the army would send a slave instead, with a promise of freedom if he survived the war. The new government of Virginia repealed the laws in 1782, and declared freedom for slaves who had fought for the colonies during the American Revolutionary War of 1775–1783. Another law passed in 1782 permitted masters to free their slaves of their own accord. Previously, a manumission had required obtaining consent from the state legislature, an arduous process which was rarely successful.

As the population of free Negroes increased, the Virginia legislature passed laws forbidding them from moving into the state (1778), and requiring newly freed slaves to leave the Commonwealth within one year unless special permission was granted (1806).

In the Upper South in the late 18th century, planters had less need for slaves, as they switched from labour-intensive tobacco cultivation to mixed-crop farming. Slave states such as Virginia made it easier for slaveholders to free their slaves. In the two decades after the American Revolutionary War, so many slaveholders accomplished manumissions by deed or in wills that the proportion of free black people to the total number of black people rose from less than 1% to 10% in the Upper South. In Virginia, the proportion of free black people increased from 1% in 1782 to 7% in 1800. Together with several Northern states abolishing slavery during that period, the proportion of free black people nationally increased to ~14% of the total black population. New York and New Jersey adopted gradual abolition laws that kept the free children of slaves as indentured servants into their twenties.

After the 1793 invention of the cotton gin, which enabled the development of extensive new areas for cotton cultivation, the number of manumissions decreased because of increased demand for slave labour. In the 19th century, slave revolts such as the Haitian Revolution of 1791–1804, and especially the 1831 rebellion led by Nat Turner, increased slaveholders&#x27; fears. Most Southern states passed laws making manumission nearly impossible until the passage of the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolished slavery &quot;except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,&quot; after the American Civil War. In South Carolina, to free a slave required permission of the state legislature; Florida law prohibited manumission altogether.

== Ottoman Empire ==

Slavery in the Ottoman Empire gradually became less central to the functions of Ottoman society throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Responding to the influence and pressure of European countries in the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire began taking steps to curtail the slave trade, which had been legally valid under Ottoman law since the beginning of the empire. A number of reforms where introduced; such as the firman of 1830, the firman of 1854 and the Kanunname of 1889. 

Ottoman Empire policy encouraged manumission of male slaves, but not female slaves. The most telling evidence for this is found in the gender ratio; among slaves traded in Islamic empire across the centuries, there were roughly two females to every male.

Sexual slavery was a central part of the Ottoman slave system throughout the history of the institution, managed in accordance with the Islamic Law of concubinage, and the most resistant to change.
Outside of explicit sexual slavery, most female slaves had domestic occupations, and often, this also included sexual relations with their masters. This was a lawful motive for their purchase, and the most common one. It was similarly a common motivation for their retention.

The Ottoman Empire and 16 other countries signed the 1890 Brussels Conference Act for the suppression of the slave trade. However, clandestine slavery persisted well into the 20th century. Gangs were also organized to facilitate the illegal importation of slaves. Slave raids and the taking of women and children as &quot;spoils of war&quot; lessened but did not stop entirely, despite the public denial of their existence, such as the enslavement of girls during the Armenian Genocide. Armenian girls were sold as slaves during the Armenian genocide of 1915. Turkey waited until 1933 to ratify the 1926 League of Nations convention on the suppression of slavery. However, illegal sales of girls were reported in the 1930s. Legislation explicitly prohibiting slavery was adopted in 1964.

<text>Nathaniel Gorham (May 27, 1738 – June 11, 1796; sometimes spelled &quot;Nathanial&quot;) was an American Founding Father, merchant, and politician from Massachusetts. He was a delegate from the Bay Colony to the Continental Congress and for six months served as the presiding officer of that body under the Articles of Confederation. He also attended the Constitutional Convention, served on its Committee of Detail, and signed the United States Constitution.

== Life ==
Starting at 15, Gorham served an apprenticeship with a merchant in New London, Connecticut, after which he opened a merchant house in Charlestown, Massachusetts, in 1759. He took part in public affairs at the beginning of the American Revolution: he was a member of the Massachusetts General Court (legislature) from 1771 until 1775, a delegate to the Provincial congress from 1774 until 1775, and a member of the Board of War from 1778 until its dissolution in 1781. In 1779, he served in the state constitutional convention. He was a delegate to the Congress of the Confederation from 1782 until 1783, and also from 1785 until 1787, serving as its president for five months from June 6 to November 5, 1786, after the resignation of John Hancock. Gorham also served a term as judge of the Middlesex County Court of Common Pleas, was a candidate for the 3rd congressional district in both 1788 and 1790, in the former election winning on the first ballot but losing on the second, and was the runner-up in the 1790 election for the U.S. Senate.

Gorham married Rebecca Call (May 14, 1744 – November 18, 1812), who was descended from Anglican vicar and the first minister of Dorchester, Massachusetts, John Maverick, and his royally descended wife, Mary Gye Maverick. Rebecca was the daughter of Caleb Call and Rebecca Stimson. They were the parents of nine children.

In 1786, it might have been Gorham who suggested to Alexander Hamilton that Prince Henry of Prussia would become president or king of the United States. However, the offer was revoked before the prince could make a reply.

For several months in 1787, Gorham served as one of the Massachusetts delegates to the United States Constitutional Convention. Gorham frequently served as chairman of the Convention&#x27;s Committee of the whole, meaning that he (rather than the president of the Convention, George Washington) presided over convention sessions during the delegates&#x27; first deliberations on the structure of the new government in late May and June 1787. After the convention, he worked hard to see that the Constitution was approved in his home state.

In connection with Oliver Phelps, he purchased from the state of Massachusetts in 1788 pre-emption rights to an immense tract of land in western New York State which straddled the Genesee River, all for the sum of $1,000,000 (about $ today). The land in question had been previously ceded to Massachusetts from the state of New York under the 1786 Treaty of Hartford. The pre-emption right gave them the first or preemptive right to obtain clear title to this land from the Native Americans. They soon extinguished the Native American title to the portion of the land east of the Genesee River, as well as a tract west of the Genesee, the Mill Yard Tract, surveyed all of it, laid out townships, and sold large parts to speculators and settlers. His son Nathaniel Gorham Jr. was a pioneer settler of this tract, having been placed in charge of his father&#x27;s interests there. In 1790, after Gorham and Phelps defaulted in payment, they sold nearly all of their remaining lands east of the Genesee to Robert Morris, who eventually resold those lands to The Pulteney Association. Phelps and Gorham were unable to fulfill their contract in full to Massachusetts, so in 1790, they surrendered back to Massachusetts that portion of the lands which remained under the Native American title, namely, the land west of the Genesee. It also was eventually acquired by Robert Morris, who resold most of it to the Holland Land Company.

== Death and legacy ==
Gorham died in Charlestown in 1796. He is buried in the Phipps Street Cemetery in Charlestown. Gorham Street in Madison, Wisconsin, is named in his honor. The town of Gorham, New York, is also named in his honor.

<text>Sharon is a city in western Mercer County, Pennsylvania, United States. The city, located along the banks of the Shenango River on the state border with Ohio, is about northeast of Youngstown, about southeast of Cleveland and about northwest of Pittsburgh. The population was 13,147 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Hermitage micropolitan area.

==History==

The Sharon area was first settled in 1795. It was incorporated as a borough on October 6, 1841, and incorporated as a city on December 17, 1918. The city operated under the Pennsylvania third-class city code until 2008, at which point it adopted a home rule charter under which the elected position of mayor was replaced with a hired city manager and financial officer.

The founding families of Sharon first settled on a flat plain bordering the Shenango River, between two hills on the southwestern edge of what is today Sharon&#x27;s downtown business district. According to local legend, the community received its name from a Bible-reading settler who likened the location to the Plain of Sharon in Israel.

Initially a center of coal mining, Sharon&#x27;s economy transitioned to iron and steelmaking and other heavy industry after the arrival of the Erie Extension Canal in the 1840s. Following extensive national deindustrialization of the 1970s and 1980s, the city&#x27;s economy diversified and is now based primarily on light industry, education, health care, and social services.

Prior to Prohibition in 1919, Sharon was home to a large commercial beer brewery, Union Brewing Co., which was forced to close its doors like many U.S. breweries of the era. During World War II the Westinghouse Electric Corporation at Sharon produced 10,000 torpedoes for the US Navy.

In 2004, local politicians proposed the creation of the city of Shenango Valley, a new municipality consisting of Sharon as well as Hermitage, Sharpsville, Farrell, and Wheatland with the issue being put on the ballot in the form of a referendum. Then Governor of Pennsylvania, Ed Rendell voiced support for the measure and would be joined by Kathleen McGinty, Secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection, and Dennis Yablonsky, Secretary of the Department of Community and Economic Development with the trio touring the region to urge for voters to pass the motion. The city would largely be an expansion of Hermitage, whose city government would be retained including the office of mayor and its nine-member city council. The merger would have kept the various independent school districts intact. The effort would ultimately be defeated, and via the ordinance, the issue of merger could not be brought up again until 2009.

In 2004 local politicians proposed the creation of Shenango Valley City, consisting of Sharpsville as well as Hermitage, Sharon, Farrell, and Wheatland with the issue being put on the ballot in the form of a referendum. Then Governor of Pennsylvania, Ed Rendell voiced support for the measure and would be joined by Kathleen McGinty, Secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection, and Dennis Yablonsky, Secretary of the Department of Community and Economic Development with the trio touring the region to urge for voters to pass the motion. The city would largely be an expansion of Hermitage, whose city government would be retained including the office of mayor and its nine-member city council. The merger would have kept the various independent school districts intact. The effort would ultimately be defeated, and via the ordinance the issue of merger could not be brought up again until 2009.

==Geography==
West Middlesex is located at (41.173630, -80.456874).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of . The Shenango River runs through West Middlesex, making it part of the Shenango Valley.

==History==
West Middlesex is one of the oldest localities in Mercer County. Samuel Byers, Andrew Wylie, William Bell, Richard Vanfleet and several others arrived in the vicinity in the late 18th century. In 1787, James Gibson received a plot of land west of the Shenango River for military services. Shortly thereafter, ownership of that land passed to Jacob Edeburn. In 1818, Jacob&#x27;s son William Edeburn built a log grist mill on part of the land. It was purchased by James McConnell in 1821, who built a log house nearby.

In 1830, Edeburn built a sawmill, and McConnell built a flour mill. James Gilkey, cultivator of the &quot;Neshannock potatoes,&quot; surveyed the site and platted the town in 1836 on McConnell&#x27;s land. A store and a tavern were opened about the time the town was platted, and in 1840 the post office was established, with Robert Young as the first postmaster.

In 1864 West Middlesex was incorporated as a borough. The first burgess was D. Edeburn, and the first members of the council were C.W. Watson, Hiram Veach and G.R. Tuttle.

West Middlesex was one of the first places in the Shenango Valley to become a center of the iron business. The old Middlesex furnace, erected in 1845, was a charcoal-burning plant. Additional coke and ore furnaces followed, including the Fannie (1873, remodeled in 1885) and the Ella (1882).

==Demographics==

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.3% of the population.

There were 391 housing units and 368 households, out of which 26.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.5% were married couples living together, 14.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.7% were non-families. 30.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.35 people, and the average family size was 2.88 people.

==Education==
The West Middlesex Area School District serves the borough of West Middlesex and its two neighboring townships, Shenango Township and Lackawannock Township. The school district serves students in grades K-12, and it also offers Head Start preschool.

Historically, West Middlesex has served students since shortly after the town was platted. A small frame house was built in 1837 for school sessions and church services, and in 1855, it was replaced by a two-story building: the first story for education, and the second story for worship. A three-story brick union schoolhouse was built in 1868.

West Middlesex is the location of the northwestern terminus of Interstate 376, which gives West Middlesex a direct highway connection to Pittsburgh as well as its primary airport. West Middlesex also lies directly on the path of Interstate 80, itself running cross-country between the New York metropolitan area and San Francisco Bay Area, and is accessible to downtown West Middlesex via I-376.

<text>Wheatland is a former borough in Mercer County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Shenango River. The population was 583 at the 2020 census. On January 1, 2024, Wheatland merged with the neighboring city of Hermitage after residents of both communities voted to approve the merger in November 2022.

==History==
Prior to the construction of the first iron furnace in the area, the land that would become Wheatland was primarily rural, and split between two family farms, the Shilling family, who arrived first, founded by pioneer George Shilling, and the Canon family, who arrived later in 1797 and where founded by Squire Canon, and joined by a Presbyterian Reverend James Satterfield. Additionally, Dr. John Mitcheltree, the pioneer physician of the entire Shenango valley during its early settling also resided in what would become Wheatland.

Wheatland would be platted in 1865 and would be incorporated on February 12, 1872. Wheatland was designed as a company town for the Wheatland Iron Co. and the Wheatland
Bessemer Steel Co. and would remain a manufacturing hub throughout much of its early history, diversifying with the opening of a Sawhill Manufacturing Co. lumbermill in 1940.

On November 10, 1908, South Sharon Borough attempted to annex a portion of Wheatland, from Kedron street in the south to Bond street in the north, and from Beechwood avenue in the east to Hamilton avenue in the west. However, the Court of Common Pleas of Mercer County overruled the attempt on May 7, 1912. On December 18, 1918, Wheatland borough annexed a 30.85 acre portion of Hickory Township via borough ordinance that was approved by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Mercer County in January 1919. On June 7, 1952, Wheatland borough annexed another parcel from Hickory Township approved by the Court in September 1952, bringing the borough to its final borders prior to absorption.

Wheatland suffered catastrophic damage on May 31, 1985, when an F5 tornado struck the area. In Wheatland, over 100 buildings were leveled, and 18 fatalities are associated with this tornado, with most being in Niles, Ohio.

From 2002 to 2007 Wheatland attempted to form an independent School District, instead of being serviced by the Farrell Area School District. This effort would see serious backlash from local residents, many of whom had moved to Wheatland for the sole purpose of being serviced by the Farrell School District, and a lawsuit ensued to instead have Wheatland be serviced by the West Middlesex Area School District.
The suit eventually reached the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania where Judges Renée Cohn Jubelirer, Doris Smith-Ribner, and James Gardner Colins struck down the secession, keeping Wheaton in the Farrell district, on account that the petition to do so, which reported 50.4% of taxpayers in favor, misrepresented what a &quot;taxpayer&quot; entailed in 2006.

From 1990 to 2009 Wheatland&#x27;s mayor was Thomas R. Stanton who led efforts to preserve the borough&#x27;s independence, personally negotiating for state resources to help residents and improve infrastructure with his governance dominating the politics of the borough in its final decades. During is departure Stanton campaigned in the borough council for support of his incoming replacement, Brian P. Estock, and ran for a single term on the borough council to help ease his transition.

In 2004 local politicians proposed the creation of Shenango Valley City, consisting of Wheatland, as well as Hermitage, Sharon, Farrell, and Sharpsville with the issue being put on the ballot in the form of a referendum. Then Governor of Pennsylvania, Ed Rendell voiced support for the measure and would be joined by Kathleen McGinty, Secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection, and Dennis Yablonsky, Secretary of the Department of Community and Economic Development with the trio touring the region to urge for voters to pass the motion. The city would largely be an expansion of Hermitage, whose city government would be retained including the office of mayor and its nine-member city council. The merger would have kept the various independent school districts intact. The effort would ultimately be defeated, and via the ordinance the issue of merger could not be brought up again until 2009.

In 2018 Wheatland formed a commission on the possibility of continuing its independence in a 137–73 vote. On November 8, 2022, a referendum was held over annexation into Hermitage which passed, stipulating automatic annexation on January 1, 2024. On top of the lack of feasibility to continue to financially support the borough, one of the leading causes for annexation was Hermitage&#x27;s more pro-business outlook. Wheatland Borough Council would have its last ever meeting on December 12, 2023, lasting just 10 minutes, councilors and six-year mayor Ronald Viglio reflected on their service to their community, and where joined with officials from Hermitage thanking them for &quot;friendship and kindness&quot; in the annexation process. The borough was merged into Hermitage on January 1, 2024. The former borough council hall will be preserved as a museum on the history of Wheatland.

<text>A tactical shooter is a sub-genre of first- and third-person shooters, associated with using strategy, planning, and tactics in gameplay, as well as the realistic simulations of ballistics, firearm mechanics, physics, stamina, and low time to kill. Dating back to strategy games from the late 1980s, the genre first rose to prominence in the late 1990s with the releases of several well-received tactical shooters. The popularity of the genre saw a decline in the late 2000s as fast-paced &quot;arcade&quot;-like action shooters rose to prominence, it has seen a revitalization since the mid-2010s with the successful releases of several modern tactical shooters.

Tactical shooters involving military operations in grounded and realistic settings are sometimes known as milsims. These games and (often) mods enhance the genre&#x27;s realism to include aspects such as individual limb damage, realistic multi-step injury treatment, enhanced ballistic and ricochet simulations, weapon wear and malfunctions, detailed vehicle damage and repairs, and lengthy trips to the area of operations, to authentically simulate military procedure.

==Game design==
According to &quot;IGN&quot;, tactical shooters &quot;are about caution, care, cooperation, coordination, planning, and pacing. In these games, making decisive pushes, quick moves for cover, strategic retreats, and last ditch grabs at the gold are not only important to success, but balanced in such a way that they become enjoyable activities in play.&quot; David Treharne of &quot;GameSpew&quot; identifies four criteria for what qualifies as a tactical shooter: &quot; you&#x27;re looking for the use of: realistic constraints of player movement; realistically simulated ballistics and accuracy; squad based or multiple approach/style accessibility; and a low tolerance or low health realistic damage model. Basically, you usually move slower than most shooters, your accuracy is much lower and bullets drop over a distance, you usually have a squad to command, and all of you only being able to take two or three shots before dying.&quot;

Tactical shooters are designed around realism and authenticity, primarily in regards to weapon functionality, movement, and mission objectives. A staple of tactical shooters is their low time to kill, where players and NPCs can be killed in a short amount of time or with very few attacks. To account for this, a number of tactical shooters implement different levels of body armor, such as in the &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; and &quot;SWAT&quot; series, though these only offer a modicum of safety and do not guarantee player survival. The consequences of death may also be high: players may have to be revived, have lengthy respawn times, or have their character killed permanently; there may also be a lack of checkpoints in levels, forcing players to restart upon failure or continue with their inflicted losses. Due to this realistic but punishing gameplay, the individual heroism seen in other shooter games is drastically restrained, players are forced to rely on proper military tactics and teamwork to succeed, and playstyles are typically slower than other types of shooters. More caution and patience is required in combat, such as methodically advancing through cover and concealment as opposed to charging toward the enemy and shooting in the open. 

Emphasis is placed on realistic modeling of weapons and ballistics, and power-ups are generally more limited than in other shooters, if existent at all. Weapons in tactical shooters are usually designed to be inaccurate while moving and more accurate while in crouching or prone stances. Jumping, which is seldom performed in real combat, is de-emphasized or even omitted, though some games may offer limited climbing or vaulting mechanics. Many tactical shooters feature &quot;leaning&quot;, where the player can lean left or right to peek and fire around corners or behind cover without exposing the rest of their body to attack. A majority of tactical shooters have sight mechanics, where players are able to either &quot;hip-fire&quot; (fire without aiming the weapon&#x27;s sights), which is less accurate but gives a wider view of the area; or &quot;aim down sights&quot; (ADS) for better accuracy, increased zoom, or an aiming reticle, at the cost of restricted visibility and camera sensitivity. To highlight their emphases on realism, tactical shooters feature limited or minimalistic HUD elements compared to most other shooters, the extent of which can vary depending on the game, difficulty, or selected options, ranging from the absence of a minimap or health bar to the full or partial absence of HUD staples such as crosshairs and ammunition counters.

Some tactical shooters make use of squad-based tactics, where the player character (and usually also the enemy) is supported by a team of allied units, typically computer-controlled. While early tactical shooters had simple AI allies who followed set pathing, AI in later games has evolved with more complex responses such as autonomously seeking cover. In games with sufficiently robust AI, the player character may be able to issue commands to AI squadmates, such as ordering them to cover an advance, flank a position, or clear an area of hostiles such as in &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;. Some games in the genre allow players to plan their team&#x27;s movements before a mission, which the AI then follows independently. Multiplayer tactical shooters may allow other players to assist each other either in the same squad or even commanding their own squads, allowing human players to strategize and coordinate more effectively compared to the limited commands available for AI. Team tactics are emphasized in tactical shooters more than other shooter genres, and thus accurate aiming and quick reflexes are not always sufficient for victory.

The game&#x27;s setting and scope are usually reflected in the game&#x27;s level designs and mechanics. For example, in &quot;SWAT 4&quot;, the player leads a contemporary SWAT team against criminals and terrorists in an East Coast metropolis; thus, it follows that most levels in the game are inspired by the urban and suburban Eastern United States, with most levels set indoors, and most level layouts and gameplay focusing on the close-quarters combat that SWAT teams specialize in; and therefore, the game features equipment that work within the game&#x27;s setting, such as door wedges to seal doors and tasers to stun and arrest enemies. The setting itself defines how &quot;realistic&quot; the game may be: a game depicting modern warfare set in the present may use modern combat tactics with realistic weapons, while a game set in the near future or a different universe may incorporate elements of science fiction and use fictional or theoretical advanced technology, while still using generally sensible combat tactics. The setting may also determine what level objectives the game may feature: the &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; and &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; series each depict counterterrorist tactical units, so the objectives seen in most of their games are centered around the typical duties of those units, namely defeating terrorists, rescuing hostages, and defusing bombs.

===Weapons===
Tactical shooters feature a wide variety of weapons often modeled on real firearms. The weapons featured depend on the setting, but are generally intended to suit the period (so a game set in World War II would feature period-accurate weaponry and lack modern weapons such as the M16 rifle). Ballistics are typically simulated, as are elements of authenticity such as recoil, motion blur, ear-ringing from explosions, and the feeling of being suppressed. Some developers of tactical shooters may hire technical advisors from military, law enforcement, or firearms specializations to ensure accuracy in in-game depictions.

Simulating actual combat is often sacrificed in favor of balance as well as playability. There may be considerable modifications to in-game weapons and ballistics compared to real life, deliberately done to ensure game balance in multiplayer PvP or competitive modes. For instance, tactical shooters with notable competitive scenes such as the &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; series typically allow the player to survive multiple bullet hits to the torso (ignoring the bullet resistance of different types of ballistic vests) and even more to the legs (rarely armored in real life), while registering an automatic kill for melee hits to the back (whether punches or knife stabs) and headshots (regardless of weapon caliber, impact point, or whether the target is wearing a helmet).

In contrast to run-and-gun shooters such as &quot;Quake&quot; which allow players to carry full arsenals, tactical shooters place considerable restrictions on what players may be equipped with, requiring players to carefully select their weapons, equipment, and inventories accordingly. The typical loadout setup used in tactical shooters is that of one &quot;primary weapon&quot; (traditionally a long gun such as a rifle, shotgun, submachine gun, or light machine gun) and one &quot;secondary weapon&quot; (traditionally a sidearm such as a handgun). Grenades of both &quot;explosive&quot;/&quot;lethal&quot; (such as fragmentation grenades and Molotov cocktails) and &quot;tactical&quot;/&quot;non-lethal&quot; (such as stun grenades and smoke grenades) varieties, and useful equipment such as medkits, are often under their own slots, sometimes used with a single input as opposed to individually equipping them. Melee weapons such as combat knives may also have their own slot, though games with more distant or firearm-based combat (such as &quot;Arma 3&quot;) may lack melee weapons entirely. Rocket launchers and grenade launchers, occasionally having their own &quot;launcher&quot; slot, may have varying focuses compared to their &quot;general purpose&quot; depictions in arcade shooters, such as dedicated ATGM and MANPADS launchers, or underbarrel anti-personnel grenade launchers that can be equipped on some rifles and carbines. In many instances, the player&#x27;s selected class affects what weapons are available to them; a rifleman class, for example, may only have rifles and carbines as their available primary weapons. This prevents &quot;jack-of-all-trades&quot; loadouts where one player can carry everything they need, and promotes cooperation between players with different loadouts and classes

In most tactical shooters, the basic weapon and equipment slots are the extent of the player&#x27;s inventory; however, in some more expansive games, such as the &quot;Arma&quot; series, individual items such as magazines for equipped weapons are carried in the player&#x27;s inventory, which must be managed to mitigate its effects on the player character&#x27;s weight. Carry weight is a game mechanic in many tactical shooters, increasing with the weapons, armor, or items carried by the player character, and affecting movement speed, stamina, time taken to aim down sights, and the ability to focus while aiming. The weight mechanic forces players to properly manage their inventory and choose whether they value mobility, effectiveness, or protection, preventing &quot;jack-of-all-trades&quot; loadouts where one player can carry everything they need, and promoting cooperation between players with different loadouts and classes. In many tactical shooters featuring a weight system, weight is always a present factor that must be dealt with; however, in some, such as the &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; series, weight only applies to what is currently equipped—so a machine gun would be &quot;heavier&quot; than a knife, despite them both being carried by the player—meaning loopholes around weight restrictions may be found, such as equipping a knife to move faster.

Many tactical shooters (especially modern releases) feature varying degrees of weapon customization. In most modern tactical shooters, this is limited to the addition of firearm attachments such as a variety of scopes, holographic sights, laser sights, flashlights, foregrips, and suppressors. In games where weight is a factor, the player&#x27;s equipped attachments may add to their character&#x27;s weight. In less-grounded shooters, weapon customization may extend to stylized weapon camouflage skins and keychain-style &quot;charms&quot; (as seen in &quot;Rainbow Six Siege&quot;), while in more detailed and comprehensive shooters, individual components of the gun itself such as the barrel shroud and stock may be customized or replaced (as seen in &quot;Escape from Tarkov&quot;).

Despite generally aiming for realism and accuracy, some tactical shooters tend to make exceptions with their weapon accuracy. &quot;Akimbo&quot; (dual wielding) of firearms is generally rare in tactical shooters, yet it still appears as an option occasionally, such as in &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; with weapons ranging from small pistols to long-barreled shotguns. The Desert Eagle, despite being unsuitable for actual military applications, is still frequently found in many tactical shooters as a high-powered handgun option. Outdated weapons such as the AK-47 are often seen in modern military service in some games, despite them being mostly replaced by modern times (the AK-47 in particular having been replaced in Soviet Army service by the AK-74 in the 1970s). Experimental weapons, such as the OICW, are commonly seen in many titles, such as the &quot;Ghost Recon&quot; and &quot;Delta Force&quot; series, and modern tactical shooters have tended to place more of an emphasis on the future of warfare through the implementation of drones and micro-cameras.

==History==

Features now common to the tactical shooters genre originated in the late 1980s and early 1990s, starting with &quot;Airborne Ranger&quot; (1987) by Microprose. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; compared it to the earlier 1985 arcade game &quot;Commando&quot;, a more typical action shooter of the period, but commented that it was &quot;deeper and more versatile&quot;. The game featured a limited inventory which had to be carefully managed, a variety of mission types which often promoted guile over violence, and the impetus to plan ahead and outmaneuver the enemy—all of which are features common in the tactical shooter genre as a whole. &quot;Airborne Ranger&quot; was followed by &quot;Special Forces&quot; (1991), also by Microprose, which first introduced squad mechanics to the genre. Also considered an early tactical shooter is &quot;Hostages&quot; (1988) by Infogrames, in which the player takes the role of French GIGN operatives to besiege and raid an embassy that has been taken over by terrorists, which &quot;Destructoid&quot; compared to the later &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; franchise of tactical shooters.

The next technical breakthrough came in 1993 with the release of &quot;SEAL Team&quot; by Electronic Arts. This game already offered many of the basic features associated with the genre, including utilizing support elements and vehicular units, and running a real-time simulated environment (with 3D Vector graphics) that reacts to the player&#x27;s actions. Experiments in tactical shooter design were sparse over the next five years, and included &quot;Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri&quot;, released in 1996—one of first 3D-rendered games with squad-oriented gameplay.

The first major successes of the genre came in 1998, with games such as &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;, &quot;Ghost Recon&quot;, and &quot;Delta Force&quot;, which are credited for defining and refining the genre. Other influences on the genre included games such as the &quot;SOCOM &quot;series, as well as the &quot;SWAT&quot; series, a tactical shooter spin-off of the &quot;Police Quest&quot; series of adventure games.

&quot;Rainbow Six&quot; (1998) in particular has been credited as a revolutionary game which defined the conventions of the tactical shooter genre. The game was inspired by (and, before its connection with Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;, initially focused on) the FBI Hostage Rescue Team. The game was designed to emphasize strategy in a way that would be fun for players without the best reflexes. The series has since become a benchmark for the genre in terms of detail and accuracy.

Some of the most notable tactical shooters have been total conversion mods of first-person shooters which have been released for free. &quot;Infiltration&quot;, a total conversion of &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; (1999), has been described as &quot;turning &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;&#x27;s wild cartoon action into a harrowing game of cat and mouse&quot;. &quot;Infiltration&quot; has been noted for detailed aiming system including hip-fire and sights while lacking a crosshair, different movement stances (running, walking, crouching, and prone, leaning around corners), and a weapon customization feature with a weight penalty. &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; (2000), a mod of Valve&#x27;s &quot;Half-Life&quot; (1998), was the most popular multiplayer game of its era, in spite of the release of arcade-style first-person shooters with more advanced graphics engines such as &quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot;. One of the developers of the &quot;Half-Life&quot; expansions was Gearbox Software, who later released the game &quot;Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30&quot; (2005) that further defined the genre. Critics praised the game for not only adding realism to its first-person shooter gameplay, but also in its unique tactical gameplay that allows players to command soldiers and teams during combat.

===Decline and resurgence===

By the late 2000s, arcade-style casual shooters such as &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot; (2007) began to prove more popular than classic-style shooters such as &quot;Quake&quot; and &quot;Unreal&quot;, although the field of true tactical shooters was largely neglected by developers since the mid-to-late 2000s. At that point, most tactical shooter franchises such as &quot;SWAT&quot; and &quot;SOCOM&quot; were discontinued, while developers such as Red Storm and Sierra went defunct or were absorbed by larger companies.

Traditionally tactical shooter series like &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; and &quot;Ghost Recon&quot; drifted away from tactical realism towards cinematic action-centered themes, as can be witnessed by contemporary &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; sequels, which completely do away with the series&#x27; pre-action planning stage (last seen in 2003&#x27;s &quot;Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield&quot;) and the series&#x27; established counterterrorism setting as of &quot;Rainbow Six Siege&quot; (2015, in updates released later) and &quot;Rainbow Six Extraction&quot; (2022); and the futuristic settings of &quot;Ghost Recon: Future Soldier&quot; (2012), which features invisibility cloaks and shoulder-mounted anti-tank rockets. Even the &quot;Spec Ops&quot; series, which began as a brutally realistic, almost impenetrably-so, tactical shooter, was transformed into a more cinematic story-focused generic third-person shooter.

However, in the 2010s, tactical shooters saw a fair resurgence, with the successful releases of &quot;Arma 3&quot; (2013) and &quot;Insurgency&quot; (2014) early in the decade. The later releases of tactical shooters like &quot;Rising Storm 2: Vietnam&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2018), &quot;Squad&quot; (2020), and &quot;Ready or Not&quot; (2021) in the late 2010s and early 2020s signaled a revitalization of the genre. Tactical shooters continue to enjoy a fairly large following as more games are released that follow the genre&#x27;s design philosophy and emphasize strategy, driven largely by indie developers.

Casual games like &quot;Rainbow Six Siege&quot; and &quot;Battlefield V&quot; have also demonstrated &quot;back to roots&quot; philosophies, such as the removal of regenerative health and &quot;3D spotting&quot; in the latter.

Outside typical tactical shooters, the game mechanics and realistic simulations of the genre have also been used in battle royale games, extraction shooters, and esports-centric games. However, as few of them feature the game design staples of tactical shooters (such as strategic planning, squad-level tactics, slow-paced gameplay, and a realistic premise), they are usually not considered as such.

Tactical shooters have also been released as virtual reality games, such as &quot;Hot Dogs, Horseshoes &amp; Hand Grenades&quot;, &quot;Pavlov VR&quot;, &quot;Onward&quot;, and &quot;Breachers VR&quot;.

== Military use ==
&quot;Virtual Battlespace&quot; is a series of tactical shooter simulators developed by &quot;Arma&quot; series creators Bohemia Interactive, used for infantry training by the United States military and several NATO militaries. Its Pointman user interface combines head tracking, a motion-sensitive gamepad and sliding foot pedals to increase the precision and level of control over one&#x27;s avatar, enabling users to more realistically aim their weapon and practice muzzle discipline, to take measured steps when moving around obstacles or cover, and to continuously control their postural height to make better use of cover and concealment.

<text>Juniata Terrace, a former industrial village, is a borough in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 567 at the 2020 census. Juniata Terrace was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district on May 17, 2024.

==History==
Modern chemistry during the Industrial Revolution invented products that made life more affordable and convenient. One major product was rayon. Of the three ways to manufacture it, the British firm of George Courtauld &amp; Co. purchased the patent for the manufacturing of ‘viscose’ rayon in 1906. Perfecting the manufacturing process, they looked to the exploding population of the United States to establish manufacturing.

===American Viscose Co.===
In 1909 Courtauld founded the American Viscose Co. in Philadelphia and built their first rayon manufacturing plant in Marcus Hook, PA. With enormous success, a second plant was built in Roanoke, VA in 1916.

The demand for rayon, also named artificial silk at the time, continued to far surpass production capabilities. A third plant was scheduled for construction in Lewistown. The first phase opened here in 1921, employing over 1,400 men and women. Demand continued to increase, so a plant expansion was started in May, 1922 to double the size of the workforce. Subsequent expansions through 1928 made employment soar to almost 5,000 men and women. Women exceeded 40% of the workforce.

American Viscose had to look to western PA to find additional employees. Many working in the coal mines found the new rayon plant working conditions better and the Lewistown area appealing. The company decided to build an industrial village to house the new workers.

===Birth of Juniata Terrace===
Land was found just south of the plant, on a hill that was a 150-acre farm. Owned as an investment by Dr. Henry Sweigart of Lewistown, almost half of the farm was slated for the new industrial village. On May 17, 1922 American Viscose Co. purchased the farm for $45,000. 
Dr. Swigart was given the honor of naming the new village, “Juniata Terrace.”

The Shade family was renting the farm from Dr. Sweigart. American Viscose continued to rent approximately 80 acres to the Shade’s. They were told that they could stay as long as they wished. For the next 51 years, Bill Shade operated and lived on the farm, even beyond the closing of the Lewistown plant. American Viscose kept its promise.

===Design of Juniata Terrace===
The Philadelphia architecture firm of Bellinger &amp; Perrot designed the three American Viscose plants, including the Lewistown plant with its expansions. During that time, Emile G. Perrot left the company and started his own firm to concentrate on designs of buildings for universities and churches. His work was so respected that American Viscose asked him to design the new community of Juniata Terrace.

Perrot traveled Europe and the US extensively to adopt design styles for the villages under his direction. His first was a village at the Marcus Hook Viscose plant and then a larger industrial village in Wilmington, DE. To alleviate the feeling of congestion, he used a popular design concept from the Garden Cities movement that provided for open space and greenways within a community of closely built homes. Perrot decided this would be the best approach for the industrial village of Juniata Terrace.

Perrot chose a red brick, Late 19th and Early 20th Century American Movements house style for the village. This architecture style allowed Perrot to employ cost-saving, repetitive designs while assimilating the row homes within the Garden City community. Perrot’s use of multiple architectural design influences were certainly significant for the enduring historic qualities of Juniata Terrace. Although the features were simplistic, the totality of the village layout, the repetitive front porches and bay windows and the slanted rooflines come together to form a harmonious design.

Formally organized around one large, central green-space boulevard in four sections, four blocks of row homes align the boulevard on each side. The front of the eight blocks of row homes face the centralized green space known as Terrace Boulevard. One additional block of homes is situated behind the first block of Terrace Blvd., fronting Hudson Avenue. Those homes face north. Two other blocks arranged linearly are situated behind the south side of the first two blocks of Terrace Blvd. Those homes face south, fronting Delaware Avenue. The fourth block of Terrace Boulevard is set at an angle, providing some relief to the linear layout.

The village consisted of 250 homes, the elementary school, the store building with a grocery store and a drug store and 112 garages. The grocery store was originally leased by the Weis Pure Foods Stores, today’s Weis Markets. A full playground was built for the school and village. American Viscose gifted the land for the church in 1950. It opened in 1952. Today, the village is the same except that 52 of the garages remain and the school is being repurposed.

The village was considered the most modern for its time, with homes having full plumbing, a coal furnace in the basement for central heating, all electrical wiring enclosed within the walls of the homes, and piped sewage from each home underground to the disposal plant. The residents were given the option of telephone service since Bell Telephone provided the lines to the homes. Twelve windows, and nineteen in the end and break homes, provide considerable natural sunlight and ventilation. The original design and features are still current for today’s living requirements.

Each home featured a living room, a dining room and a kitchen on the first floor, with a full bathroom, three bedrooms and closets on the second floor. The front porches are still an important feature, and the second-floor bay windows and sloping roofs add character to the fronts of the homes. The back yards feature a hair-pin iron fence with a gate. The popular “Green and Cream” trim made a uniform appearance, still in practice today.

===Construction===
The Ballinger Co. was hired to manage construction and design the storm drainage and sewer system. This included the building of a modern sewage treatment plant. The H.C. Ambler Co. was the excavator and the Brocklehurst Co. was the general contractor, both from Philadelphia. Hundreds of various trade workers were hired. Sub-contractors provided wallpapering, furnaces and landscaping. A number of local companies participated in construction and supply of materials.

A spur rail line was constructed up the hill from the Pennsylvania Rail Road to the corner of today’s Delaware Ave. and Rt. 103. This was necessary to deliver the massive earth moving equipment and the tons of building supplies. The project required millions of feet of lumber, bricks and wallboard, over 3,000 windows and 3,000 doors, drainage and sewer pipes, kitchen and bathroom appliances and fixtures, and much more over the next two years.

After the train from Philadelphia arrived, ground was broken on Monday, June 25, 1923. The “big cut” was excavated to create the terraced area for the community. The removed dirt was pushed to create the space for the school, playground and stores (and eventually the church). The first home was occupied by the Allen family in December, 1924. Daughter Sandy still lives in a home at Juniata Terrace. The last home was occupied in December, 1925. The streets and sidewalks were completed early in 1926 and the boulevards were planted with grass, bushes, trees and flowers that fall. The stores opened in 1927. The school was gifted to the School District of Granville Township on August 30, 1928, just prior to its opening.

===Residents===
As landlords, American Viscose Co. required at least one person on the lease of each home to work at the Lewistown plant. In some cases, one or more did, with a wife, and even adult children. Rent was initially $1.00 a week, deducted from weekly earnings. With the residents’ annual earnings of $1,100 to $1,300 a year, this was a considerable relief to families. By May, 1944, the weekly rent increased to $4.60, still a significant benefit. It is not surprising that there was a long wait-list of employees wanting to live at Juniata Terrace.

The 1930 census shows that there were 1,710 residents, with 610 working for American Viscose. Some homes had upwards of 13 occupants. A number of homes took in borders- usually family members or close friends who were on a wait list to get their own home at Juniata Terrace. Cots for sleeping in the basement must have been a cozy life.

There was a maintenance person on site, employed by American Viscose. If something needed repaired, it was his responsibility. Paint and wall papering was refreshed when needed. All outside areas were maintained by American Viscose.

Some have called Juniata Terrace a company town, which is incorrect. Other than required employment at American Viscose, there were no other requirements of the residents. There was no company script, no company store where purchases were required or any of the horrific conditions for which company towns received such dire reputations. American Viscose got it right when they called it an industrial village.

===After American Viscose===
When American Viscose was sold in 1949, its new owner did not want to own and support housing for its workers. So, all homes were offered for sale to the renter. The last home was purchased in December, 1950. From that point, the streets and public lands of Juniata Terrace became the ward of Granville Township and the new Juniata Terrace Civic Association. Improvements were made through the years by the Civic Association, building a cable TV system in 1954, a second playground in circa 1959 and a new community building in 1961. It also erected its War Memorial honoring those residents who gave their lives for our freedom.

In 1967, Juniata Terrace became a borough independent of Granville Township, as its own governing entity with a Mayor and Borough Council. More improvements continued, such as street lighting and the paving of alleys. In 1972, when the Viscose closed after destruction by Hurricane Agnes, many residents at Juniata Terrace lost their jobs. Unlike what has happened to industrial towns across America, Juniata Terrace did not die. Even after a devastating fire in 2014 affecting 25 homes, it quickly rebounded.

The Garden City design of Juniata Terrace was significant in creating an environment for the enjoyment and benefit of its residents. It supported the unified society of Juniata Terrace, allowing its residents to maintain its own middle-class social order without it being boxed in as a closed society. In turn, residents’ participation in churches, schools, recreation and other activities in Lewistown blended the two communities into a larger social entity.

Juniata Terrace has survived the Great Depression, major wars, its sale by American Viscose, the closing of American Viscose and a major fire.

<text>Kistler is a borough in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 292 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Kistler is located at (40.380652, -77.867737).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and (7.14%) is water.

==History==
Kistler, Pennsylvania is one of the United States&#x27; lesser known Company Towns. A Company Town is a settlement built and operated by a single business enterprise. Most company towns were established between 1880 and 1930 during the early industrial age. See list of company towns.

Kistler was initially established to meet the needs of a large manufacturing plant by providing comfortable homes for its workmen within close proximity of the factory. The town was built and owned by the Mount Union Refractories Company (MURC), a large brick making plant originally located at the foot of Mount Union, Pennsylvania.
The MURC sought to design and implement an industrial village which provided the best home and surrounding environment for its employees, in the hope that this would achieve the highest possible working efficiency. In order to successfully accomplish this goal, the company appointed distinguished town planner John Nolen to design a model company town. John Nolen was a prominent planner of his time, producing nearly four hundred planning projects, with more than 25 of those company towns. Nolen published New Towns for Old in 1927, which carefully outlines in detail the planning precautions taken in the towns’ design and also includes illustrations of Kistler’s planned layout.

=== Development ===

Nineteen-eighteen saw the construction of the industrial village. At this stage, MURC employed some seven hundred employees. The town of Kistler was located on the east side of the Juniata River, one and one-half miles east of the Refractories site. MURC acquired a land parcel of approximately sixty acres on the opposite side of the river from the works, in order to reduce the potential spread of dust, dirt and noise. The site of the planned town was triangular in shape, bordered by the Juniata River, the Pennsylvania Railroad Topography and preexisting agricultural land.

=== Town Layout ===

Although there was no definite axis in John Nolen’s design, the centre point of the plan was said to be the major recreational facility, ‘Kistler Green’. These well planned open spaces provided recreational areas for all residents. Park Road and Nolen Street were the two arterials leading into the development from the south, while running parallel to the railway is State Street. Nolen’s original plan included provisions for a proposed train station.

=== Street Design ===

There were two major street widths in the design of Kistler. The forty foot design allowed for eighteen foot of road and twenty-two feet of sidewalk and planting space. In contrast the seventy foot street allowed for two lanes with a central twenty-two foot parking strip. The street widths played a pivotal role in allocating as much area to the lot owner as possible whilst avoiding street paving costs. In the early stages of the development while the streets would not have been prone to large volumes of traffic throughput they served a secondary purpose; play spaces for children.

=== Park Features ===

The large amount of open areas in Nolen’s design retained the natural woods which included willow, locust, sycamore, persimmon and black and white oak. The river embankment was to be reserved for parkland with the northern end comprising a playground and picnic facilities and the south a boat landing, athletic field, baseball diamond and a field house.

=== Housing design ===

The houses constructed for employees were built with varying character in detached or semi detached quadrangles. This was thought to bring some individuality among the residents and their houses and to generally provide the best surroundings for the employees and their families. Dwellings were built on block sizes of forty feet in width by one hundred feet in depth. Almost two hundred dwellings were built in total, with houses ranging from four to eight rooms in total and all houses including their own baths and porches.

=== Community wellbeing ===
It was evident that Nolen and MURC gave considerable attention to the welfare of the citizens of Kistler. The design aspired to provide not only comfortable housing and surrounds, but equally importantly it attempted to promote a sense of belonging and citizenship among the residents. John Nolen discusses the success of Kistler and its design in his book &quot;New Towns for Old&quot; (1927) when he states that ‘there are few places in this country where the problem of low cost housing, primarily for the unskilled worker has been better solved for the employer and employee alike.

<text>Lewistown is a borough in and the county seat of Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is the principal city of the &quot;Lewistown, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area&quot;, which encompasses all of Mifflin County. It lies along the Juniata River, northwest of Harrisburg.

The number of people living in the borough in 1900 was 4,451; in 1910, 8,166; in 1940, 13,017; and in 2000, 8,998. The population was 8,561 at the 2020 census. Of the four communities in the United States named &quot;Lewistown&quot;, Lewistown, Pennsylvania is the largest.

== History ==

===18th century===
The borough was incorporated in 1795 and was named for William &quot;Bill&quot; Lewis, a Quaker and a member of the state legislature. He gained designation of the borough, which was known then as the Village of Ohesson, as the county seat of Mifflin County.

===19th century===
During the late 19th century, Mifflin County became the crossroads of the Commonwealth. Located near the geographic center of the state, the area became a hub for traffic moving in every direction. Early roads crisscrossed the region, but it was the construction of the Pennsylvania Canal and the railroads that followed that gave stimulus to Mifflin County as an economic force in the state.

Lewistown, as the major city in Mifflin County, saw its economy expand dramatically as entrepreneurs launched companies to construct canal boats or build inns offering lodging for travelers and workers.

At its zenith, Mifflin County was one of the busiest centers for cargo and passenger traffic in the United States. But with the demise of the canal system, Mifflin County eventually lost its place as a major transportation hub.

On April 16, 1861, as the American Civil War broke out, Lewistown sent its Logan Guards, a militia group formed in 1858, to defend the national capital of Washington, D.C. They were one of five companies, all recruited in Pennsylvania, to share the honor of being the first U.S. troops sent to the capital. Monument Square, situated at the intersection of Main and Market Streets in Lewistown, serves as a memorial to these men.

===20th century===
Lewistown lost its role as a major transportation hub, but still boasted a strong industrial economy into the 1970s, when the county&#x27;s industries began a slow decline.

The effects of Hurricane Agnes in June 1972 crippled the local economy. On June 19, Hurricane Agnes made initial landfall along the Florida Panhandle as a weak Category 1 Hurricane. Agnes proceeded through Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina before moving over the Atlantic off the North Carolina coast on June 21.

After regaining strength over the Atlantic, the storm made landfall again over southeastern New York on June 22 and moved westward in an arc over southern New York into north-central Pennsylvania. Hurricane Agnes became nearly stationary over Pennsylvania by morning of June 23, but was soon absorbed by a low-pressure system that slowly drifted northeastward from Pennsylvania into New York.

Rainfall from the storm over the Mid-Atlantic region ranged from in the extreme upper basins of the Potomac and North Branch Susquehanna Rivers to near Shamokin, Pennsylvania, in the Main Stem Susquehanna River basin. An average of of rain fell over the Mid-Atlantic region. The soil, already well watered by spring rains, could not absorb so much water so quickly.

While flooding from the Juniata River was somewhat controlled due to a dam at Raystown Lake, west of Lewistown, the county suffered extensive flooding from the river and major streams. This resulted in the permanent closure of many businesses along the river.

Most notably, the flood submerged much of the American Viscose Corporation plant, then a division of FMC Corporation. The facility, located on the banks of the Juniata River across from Lewistown proper, manufactured rayon fiber (primarily for rayon-belted automobile tires), polyester, and Avistrap.

FMC was one of two major employers in the area at the time, the other being the Standard Steel Works. The Viscose plant was only marginally profitable before the storm, and the cost to reopen was prohibitive. The demand for rayon fabric for trendy clothing shot upward a few years later. Rayon production, and with it, thousands of good-paying jobs, moved to another FMC plant in Front Royal, Virginia. The Lewistown polyester plant reopened, but it rehired only a fraction of the previous workforce. The site eventually became the Mifflin County Industrial Plaza and a variety of businesses have come and gone since then.

In the wake of the failure of Lewistown&#x27;s industry, a long period of decline began. The 1990s saw the loss of several plants, including Masland and Lear, and Standard Steel filing for reorganization bankruptcy.

===21st century===
The early 2000s saw the loss of Scotty&#x27;s Fashions, Mann Edge Tool, Overhead Door shuttering its sectional division, and Ford New Holland shuttering its Belleville plant. This led to the related closing of the Belleville Foundry.

In 2011, Standard Steel merged with Japanese company Sumitomo Industries and is now known as Nippon Steel. This merger effectively saved the jobs of 500 union laborers as well as many others in the area. First Quality, an adult incontinence products manufacturer, opened a facility in Lewistown that employs approximately 400 people. Geisinger purchased Lewistown Hospital in 2013 and expanded services, including a helicopter pad, the Geisinger LIFE program, and a new clinic in nearby Reedsville.

In the 2020s, Lewistown has seen growth in new small businesses by young entrepreneurs, including restaurants and retail. The construction of an enhanced highway system between Lewistown and State College was completed in 2020 and better connects the two communities.

<text>McVeytown is a borough in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, United States, on the west bank of the Juniata River. Formerly known as Waynesburg, it was settled in 1762, laid out in 1795, and incorporated in 1833. The population was 344 at the 2020 census. The &quot;Father of Pennsylvania Forestry&quot;, Dr. Joseph Rothrock was born in McVeytown on April 9, 1839. He was largely responsible for the acquisition of the lands that became Pennsylvania state parks and forests, including Rothrock State Forest.

==History==
The settlement of what is now McVeytown was begun by Samuel Holliday in 1755, but it was only in 1762 that he settled in permanently and not until 1795 that the town of Waynesburg (present day McVeytown) was laid out. John McVey owned the land and was the founder of McVeytown.

Samuel, Adam, John and William Holliday, and his two sisters, Elizabeth and Nancy, the latter of whom would become the wife of Andrew Bratton, immigrated to the U.S. in 1745 and located on the “manor” of Lancaster County. They moved later to Conococheague in what is now Franklin County, and John removed to Path Valley, where he lived and died. Adam and William took up land at Hollidaysburg, and it was from him that the borough took its name. In early 1775, Samuel Holliday and Andrew Bratton, just after the New Purchase of the Indians, went out into that region in search for land to settle. After they made a decision on the land, they went to the land-office, at the time located in Philadelphia, and in 1775 received their warrants. Bratton was in what is now Bratton Township, and Holliday at what is now McVeytown and vicinity.

<text>Newton Hamilton is a borough (established April 12, 1843) in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 197 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
On June 15, 1762, Hugh Brown obtained a warrant for two hundred and fifty acres of land, a portion of which would later become known as the borough of Newton Hamilton. Sometime before 1783, Brown was killed during an encounter with Indigenous peoples in the area. During the resolution of Brown&#x27;s estate, that land was inherited by Margaret Hamilton, according to 18th-century land ownership and assessment documents in Pennsylvania&#x27;s Juniata and Susquehanna Valley region, which show that Hamilton&#x27;s land holdings were assessed at sixty acres in 1783. Hamilton subsequently sold &quot;lots 28-29 &#x27;in the general plan of Newton Hamilton&#x27; to Samuel McCurdy on January 19, 1802,&quot; according to historian Franklin Ellis, who also noted that the town of Newton Hamilton &quot;was laid out under its present name about 1802&quot; by Margaret Hamilton, who &quot;lived and died there.&quot; Those plots of land were described in records of the period as having been fifty by one hundred and fifty feet, and were situated on what is, today, the north side of the borough&#x27;s Front Street.

Hamilton then sold lots fifty-seven and fifty-eight to James Irvine on April 18, 1803. Sixty by one hundred and thirty feet each, those lots were located on what is, today, the south side of Newton Hamilton&#x27;s Second Street.

When Catharine (McAneer) Murfin relocated with her parents to Newton Hamilton in 1826, the hamlet was composed of just seven log homes, which were owned by wheelwright Acquilla Burchfield, John McGeehan, John Murray, John Shafer, and others.

In February and October 1828, respectively, Patrick and James Moffit bought land in Newton Hamilton and &quot;lived in a plastered house by the spring,&quot; according to Ellis. That land later became the land on which &quot;the Sigler mansion&quot; was located. That same year, Elijah Davis opened a store.

By this time in the hamlet&#x27;s history, surveyors for Pennsylvania&#x27;s growing canal system had surveyed the area in preparation for establishing new canal routes and stops, which helped to fuel further land sales. John Postlethwait then opened and began operating a tavern in 1829, which later became known as the Logan House, and which was followed by the store openings of Robert Thompson &amp; Co. and Richard A. McDowel &amp; Co.

By 1830, the town also had a school, which was operated by Samuel Cross in a house adjacent to the land that would become the site of the Sigler mansion. Within six years, the town had grown to include the following residents and workers:

* Boat builder: Robert M. Davidson;
* Carriage and wagonmakers: John Coulter, Charles H. Knox, Joseph Laughlin, Benjamin Norton;
* Carpenters: Lewis Barnard, Samuel A. Corbett, Jacob Hesser, Nathan Jones, William McAnear, Robert A. McDowell, Joseph and Samuel D. Postlethwait, Thomas J. Postlethwait Jr., Alfred Walker;
* Gentlemen: Jonathan J. Cumming, John C. Purcell;
* Saddlers: Alexander Cumming, Thomas Galbraith, George Guss;
* Shinglemakers: Thomas Baird, William Harvey;
* Tailors: Casper Bucher, Burr L. Buckley, Robert Witherow; and
* Teachers: James and Walter Galbraith, Winchester McCarthy, and William Uttley.

On March 24, 1838, civic officials in Wayne Township bought James Irvine&#x27;s tracts of land that had been purchased from Margaret Hamilton in 1803. They then oversaw the construction of a new stone schoolhouse.

From 1840 to 1884, John Morrison served as the town&#x27;s justice of the peace. Morrison had been one of the community&#x27;s early settlers, having arrived in 1829. It was during this period that Newton Hamilton separated itself from the township in order to become an &quot;independent district&quot; in 1844. By 1845, multiple blacksmiths and boatmen were residing in the community while working nearby, John Sigler was operating a tannery plant and John Lowry and Riley J. Richards were engaged in cabinet making while merchants operating businesses here included John Bolsbach, James D. and Samuel Morrison, James North, and Joseph C. Seckler. The physicians practicing here were A. J. Akinson, M.D. and Charles Bower, M.D.

 From 1850 to 1877, John Smelker opened and operated a second tannery. As the town continued to grow during this period, it also attracted an increasing number of visitors. In response, John B. Miller purchased land and then erected a hotel in June 1867. That establishment later became known as the Everett House. Around this same time, a new bridge was erected to facilitate carriage and wagon travel across the river. Destroyed during a flood on October 8, 1880, it was rebuilt at a cost of $14,895 by G. W. Keiffer of Sunbury, Pennsylvania and completed on February 11, 1881.

<text>East Stroudsburg is a borough in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, and part of the Pocono Mountains region of the state. Originally known as Dansbury, East Stroudsburg was renamed for geographic reasons when the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad opened a station in East Stroudsburg. Despite its name being derivative of its bordering borough, Stroudsburg, it has almost twice the population.

East Stroudsburg is the largest municipality in Monroe County and in the East Stroudsburg, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area

As of the 2020 census, the population of East Stroudsburg was 9,847.

East Stroudsburg is located northeast of Allentown, north of Philadelphia, and west of New York City.

==History==
In 1737, present-day East Stroudsburg was settled by Daniel Brodhead, a judge from Marbletown, New York, who acquired a 1,000-acre lot of land on and around where Lehigh Valley Hospital–Pocono Hospital currently stands at 206 E. Brown Street in what then was Bucks County and now is Monroe County along the east bank of Brodhead Creek, then known as the Analomink River. The property was known as Dansbury Manor. Moravian missionaries, residing in Bethlehem to the town&#x27;s south, often traveled through Danbury Manor on the way to Dutchess County, New York and other northern locations.

On December 11, 1755, six months after Brodhead&#x27;s death, Danbury Manor was attacked by approximately 200 Native Americans. Brodhead&#x27;s five sons and daughter each took up arms, and fired at the attackers. While each of the Brodhead children were able to save the lives, the Native American attackers destroyed Danbury Manor.

In 1856, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad was built through present-day East Stroudsburg, which greatly increased the town&#x27;s population and economic vibrancy. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, East Stroudsburg became one of several eastern Pennsylvania centers for manufacturing and commerce.

===Railway===

East Stroudsburg station formerly served East Stroudsburg, but the last Erie Lackawanna Railway passenger train, the &quot;Lake Cities,&quot; stopped there on January 6, 1970. There are plans for the New Jersey Transit to run through and reopen this station. Most of this project however, is currently not funded. Only the MOS (Minimum Operable Segment) of the project is being built so far, from where the Eastern end of the Lackawanna Cut-Off separates from the former Lackawanna RR main line at Port Morris Jct. to Andover, New Jersey.

The track eastward from East Stroudsburg to Slateford Junction is still in service and used by the Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad three times a week both to service a paper plant at Minisink Hills and interchange freight with Norfolk Southern at Slateford Jct.
Heading west from East Stroudsburg, the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western (Lackawanna) double-track main line still has a usable single track through to Scranton. The Delaware Lackawanna Railroad provides local freight service over this segment, and passenger excursions from Steamtown, USA (located in Scranton) are run several times a year to East Stroudsburg and to the Delaware Water Gap.

==== Lackawanna Cut-Off Restoration Project ====

There is an effort to re-establish rail passenger service via New Jersey Transit between Scranton and Hoboken, New Jersey by way of the Lackawanna Cut-Off, with connecting service into Manhattan. The first physical work of this project began in 2011. Grants have been committed to bridge restoration to ensure the restoration of train movement.

The town&#x27;s name was changed in 1864 to &quot;Forks&quot;, because of its five-way intersection where Pennsylvania Route 611 and Pennsylvania Route 940 cross and Pennsylvania Route 196 begins. The name was changed again in 1886 to &quot;Mount Pocono&quot;. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad provided transportation from New York City and Philadelphia. Mount Pocono quickly developed as a summer resort, advertising clean mountain air, spring water, luxury hotels and excellent fishing.

Initially, the town was part of Coolbaugh Township. In 1927, Mount Pocono borough was incorporated on its own.

The boom times lasted into the mid-20th century. Most of the resort hotels burned or closed, and passenger service to the town ended in 1965.

Mount Airy Lodge in nearby Paradise Township grew into an 895-room mega-resort. In the mid- and late-20th century it was a popular honeymoon destination, famous for its heart-shaped bathtubs. It closed in 2001, and was demolished. Casino gambling in Pennsylvania became legal in 2004. Mount Airy Casino Resort was built on the Mount Airy Lodge&#x27;s lakeside site, and opened in 2007.

<text>Pocono Pines is a census-designated place (CDP) in Monroe County, Pennsylvania. The population in the 2020 United States Census was 2,007, an increase over the 1,409 population at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Pocono Pines is located at (41.114976, -75.460408). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and (9.95%) is water.

==History==
Pocono Pines is located in the heart of the Pocono Mountains and is home to the communities of Lake Naomi and Pinecrest Lake. Most of the land was originally owned by the Miller family. Frank C. Miller, his brother Rufus W. Miller, and others, bought lands on Tunkhannock Creek in Tobyhanna Township, Monroe County, Pennsylvania, organized a corporation known as the Pocono Spring Water Ice Company sometime in the 1890s. In September 1895, a dam was constructed across the creek and water began backing-up forming &quot;Lake Naomi&quot;, a lake more than a mile long and about one-third of a mile wide. The Pocono Spring Water Ice Company was granted a 99-year lease for &quot;the exclusive use of the water and its privileges.&quot; It was chartered for the purpose of &quot;erecting a dam, for pleasure, boating, skating, fishing and the cutting, storing and selling of ice.&quot;

In 1902, visitors came from many of the surrounding metropolitan areas including New York City and Philadelphia. In the same year, the first bathing beach was created and some lots on the north side of the lake were subdivided and sold to summer cottagers. A sailing camp for girls was set up on the northwest side of the lake. A Lutheran retreat, Lutherland, was erected on the southern side of the lake. The Millers and others utilized the southern and eastern sides of the lake for swimming, sailing, skating, fishing. In 1921, a boathouse and beach were constructed on the site of today&#x27;s Lake Naomi Clubhouse. In 1938, a famous Pennsylvania Supreme Court case took place over who owned the water rights to Lake Naomi, as the surrounding lands were soon owned by many different parties. See &quot;Miller v. Lutheran Conference &amp; Camp Ass&#x27;n&quot;, 331 Pa. 241 (Pa. 1938).

In 1963, the Logan Steele family purchased surrounding the lake which eventually was turned into a resort community called the Lake Naomi Club. Logan Steele died in the 1980s, and the club is now owned by its members and run by a board of governors. Lake Naomi Club today includes 1,400 families who own property surrounding Lake Naomi. Lake Naomi itself is a lake with private beaches and marinas. The Club has a very active sailing organization, three pools, including a 50-meter outdoor Olympic-sized pool with a scenic view of the lake, 18 tennis courts, and full service clubhouse.

There is another community center that lies directly across from Timber Trails (a branch off Lake Naomi) that was completed and opened Memorial Day weekend of 2007 for all community members to enjoy.

Eventually, Naomi Pines was renamed Pocono Pines. Route 940 is the main thoroughfare through the village of Pocono Pines. Various businesses are located at the intersection of Route 940 and Route 423.

The Pocono Manor Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

===The building of Sullivan Trail===
On May 15–6, 1779, Van Cortland&#x27;s 2nd New York Regiment, Spencer&#x27;s 5th New Jersey Regiment, and Cilly&#x27;s 1st New Hampshire Regiment arrived at Learns Tavern in Tannersville and began construction on the trail on May 17. Originally a mountain path, the road was under construction as a military road to assist with moving troops through the area for Sullivan&#x27;s Expedition. The builders reached the Hungry Hill area on May 23, Tobyhanna Creek on the 24th, Locust Hill (now Locust Ridge) on May 30, and established Camp Fatigue on June 7. The road to the Wyoming Valley (Scran/Wilkes-Barre area) was completed on June 15.

===The Battle of Locust Ridge, 1784===
In 1754, settlers from Connecticut (Yankees) claimed land in the Wyoming Valley, now the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area. The Charter of 1662 of King Charles II of England reads, &quot;We, of Our abundant Grace, . . . have given, granted, and confirmed. . . unto the said Governor and Company. . . all that Part of Our Dominions in New-England . . . bounded on the East by . . . Narraganset-Bay, . . . on the North by the Line of the Massachusetts-Plantation; and on the South by the Sea; and in Longitude . . . From the said Narraganset-Bay on the East, to the South Sea on the West Part . . .&quot;. The South Sea is now called the Pacific Ocean. Thus, settlers in Connecticut felt they had claim to the land. Pennsylvania settlers (Pennamites) laid claim to the same land by right of a royal charter. Thirdly, the Iroquois claimed the land as theirs, as they had been living there before either group of settlers arrived. Unrest was largely minimal until 1769, when Connecticut established its first permanent settlement. The resulting conflicts were eventually dubbed the Pennamite–Yankee War.

The Third Yankee-Pennamite War lasted from 1784 to 1794. In July 1784, Pennsylvania&#x27;s Supreme Executive Council raised a militia to combat the Yankee occupations. Locust Hill, now known as Locust Ridge, was the site of an engagement on August 2, 1784, between Pennamite troops under the command of Colonel John Armstrong and Yankee troops under the command of Captain John Swift. Swift&#x27;s men surrendered on August 8. Only one person died during the Battle of Locust Ridge, a man by the name of Jacob Everett.

===Industry in the 19th and 20th centuries===
From 1896 through the 1940s, one large industry in the township was ice harvesting. Ice was harvest from Lake Naomi, Pocono Lake, Stillwater Lake, Anglewood Lake, and Brady&#x27;s Lake. The ice was stored in icehouses and transported by the Wilkes-Barre and Eastern Railroad to major cities.

Another large industry was logging and lumbering. Charles Hauser built a sawmill in 1848, and Isaac Stauffer followed in 1863. Stauffer eventually purchased Hauser&#x27;s operation, and through the accumulation of 4,500 acres of land, became known as the &quot;King of the Poconos.&quot;

The area has grit walking paths. It was originally part of Pine Tree Camp, but was given to the township in the early 20th century. The main lodge was renovated in 2006.

===Eschenbach Cemetery===
The Eschenbach Cemetery was established between 1810–1830 as a private family cemetery. Andrew Eschenbach, Jr., born on December 25, 1745, to Andreas Eschenbach and Johanna Catharina Muntz, was one of the first permanent settlers in Tobyhanna Township. He and his wife, Susan Fink, moved to Tobyhanna Township in 1809. They had 10 children between 1780 and 1810, and had a large enough family that a cemetery became a necessity, as the infrastructure of the township was not sufficiently developed.

It is possible that the location of the Eschenbach Cemetery was determined by an existing grave site. The Battle of Locust Ridge took place on August 2, 1784, as part of the Yankee-Pennamite Wars between Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Jacob Everett (of Pennsylvania) was the only person to lose his life in the battle. Although lacking firm documentation, lore handed down through generations suggests he is buried in what later became the Eschenbach Cemetery.

The Eschenbach Cemetery headstones are local field stone and slate, which means the etchings have since worn away from natural weathering. While the location of who is buried at what grave site may forever be a mystery, it is known that the cemetery was the final resting place for Andrew and Susan.

===Hungry Hill Memorial===
The Hungry Hill memorial is a Revolutionary War memorial and grave site of an unknown soldier. Van Cortlandt&#x27;s 2nd New York and Spencer&#x27;s 5th New Jersey regiments camped nearby while they changed a wilderness trail into a military road. This path, known now as Sullivan Trail, paved the way for the Sullivan Expedition in 1779. General John Sullivan and Brigadier General James Clinton, who led the expedition, pushed through the area known as the Great Swamp, as they pursued a scorched earth campaign against the Iroquois. Today, the path of the original Sullivan Road within Tobyhanna Township is virtually intact.

===Keiper Park===
Keiper Park is located in the center of Tobyhanna Township. The park contains a softball field, concession stand, and a playground. The area is largely grassy fields.

===Thomas Darling Preserve===
Thomas Darling Preserve was named after Wilkes-Barre naturalist Thomas Darling Jr. The area covers of over 2,500 acres of land, featuring one of the state&#x27;s largest spruce forests.

<text>Abington Township is a township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is adjacent to Philadelphia&#x27;s northern fringe. The population was 58,502 as of the 2020 census, making it the second most populous township in Montgomery County after Lower Merion Township. The population density is 3603.3 per square mile (1,377/km2), making it the second most densely populated township in Montgomery County after Cheltenham Township.

Abington Township is one of Montgomery County&#x27;s oldest communities, dating back before 1700 and being incorporated in 1704. It is home to some of the county&#x27;s oldest transportation routes, industries and churches. Many of these older business and transportation centers were the forerunners of modern Abington. Abington contains the Willow Grove Park Mall, several small businesses, and a few of Montgomery County&#x27;s largest employers.

==History==

The land that comprises Abington today was purchased from the native Lenape by William Penn during the 1680s. By the next decade, a handful of European settlers built and lived in Hill Township, at the crossroads of Susquehanna Street Road and Old York Road. After brief times under other names, the township incorporated as Abington in 1704. The town&#x27;s name is likely taken from parishes in England formed over 900 years ago in Northamptonshire or Cambridgeshire. A local 1734 census counted 42 resident landowners. During the American Revolutionary War, there was a small battle that took place at Edge Hill.

Some institutions have been in Abington for most of its existence. The cornerstone of the original Abington Friends School, in operation since before Abington&#x27;s incorporation, is used in today&#x27;s school building. The Abington Presbyterian Church opened in the early years of the township, and while the original building is gone, its graveyard is still used today.

The railroad reached the township in 1855, with the first station building erected in 1873 on the site of today&#x27;s Noble Station.

Abington Township High School and Fox Chase Farm are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

==Communities==
Abington Township comprises seventeen &quot;communities&quot;:

* Abington
* Ardsley (also in Upper Dublin)
* Crestmont
* Elkins Park (also in Cheltenham)
* Fitzwatertown
* Fox Chase (also in Philadelphia)
* Glenside (also in Cheltenham)
* Hollywood
* Huntingdon Valley (also in Lower Moreland and Upper Moreland)
* Jenkintown (Abington&#x27;s Jenkintown community abuts on three sides the smaller independent borough of Jenkintown)
* McKinley
* Meadowbrook
* Noble
* North Hills (also in Springfield and Upper Dublin)
* Roslyn
* Roychester
* Rydal
* Willow Grove (also in Upper Dublin and Upper Moreland)

The communities are unofficial, unincorporated subdivisions of the township, corresponding roughly to voting districts and elementary school placement. Their primary importance, aside from community identity, is the postal system (e.g., to send a letter to someone living in the Glenside community, the letter would be addressed to Glenside, Pennsylvania rather than Abington Township, Pennsylvania). Additionally, some portions of some of these subdivisions, including Ardsley, Glenside, Huntingdon Valley, Jenkintown, North Hills, Willow Grove, and Elkins Park, are actually in neighboring townships.

Local civic associations include Crestmont Civic Association, Glenside Gardens Civic Association, Hollywood Civic Association, Lower Huntingdon Valley Civic Association, McKinley Civic Association, Rydal-Meadowbrook Civic Association and Tall Trees Association. The civic associations work together on Traffic Summits in even years (2012, 2014, 2016, etc.) and Economic Summits in odd years (2013, 2015, 2017, etc.). These Summits focus on eliminating traffic congestion that interferes with the growth of businesses in the Township. Pennsylvania Department of Transportation&#x27;s &quot;Traffic Calming Handbook&quot; recommends the formation of a Local Traffic Advisory Committee to work with officials to identify ways to improve safety of the community.

Area Catholic schools include Saint Luke Catholic School in Glenside and Abington Township, Queen of Angels Regional Catholic School in Willow Grove and Upper Moreland Township, and Good Shepherd Regional Catholic School in Ardsley and Upper Dublin Township. Queen of Angels was formed in 2012 by the merger of Our Lady Help of Christians in Abington and St. David in Willow Grove, while Good Shepherd was formed after the merger of parish schools at Queen of Peace in Ardsley and St. John of the Cross in Roslyn in 2010. Private Catholic schools in the area include Regina Coeli Academy in Abington, Ancillae-Assumpta Academy in Wyncote, and Martin Saints Classical High School in Oreland.

Pennsylvania State University opened the Ogontz Campus in 1950, which was renamed to Penn State Abington.

Manor College is in the township, with a Jenkintown mailing address.

<text>Ambler is a borough in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located approximately 16 miles (26 km) north of Center City Philadelphia.

==History==
===Lenape===

The historical territory of the Lenape Native American tribe was in the Delaware Valley in an area spanning from Cape Henlopen in Delaware, north to the lower Hudson Valley in southern New York. The area in the south, including present-day Philadelphia and nearby Ambler, was the home of Unami-speaking Lenape. The Lenape established a peace treaty with Quaker William Penn in the 1680s.

===Harmer family===

William and George Harmer are listed among the Quakers who immigrated to Pennsylvania in 1682. In 1716, William and George Harmer purchased a 408-acre tract from William Penn, an area including most of what now is Ambler Borough. They are credited as the first landholders to actually settle in the area. William Harmer built a gristmill powered by the Wissahickon Creek, &quot;the first commercial venture in the Ambler area&quot;. He also built a stone dwelling with casement windows and diamond shaped leaded glass, near what is now the intersection of Butler Pike and Morris Road. After his death in 1731, the house, mill, and property were sold to Morris Morris and his wife Susanna Heath Morris.

===Wissahickon===

Residents sought permission from The Crown to build roads in the area. The first road built in Ambler, now known as Mt. Pleasant Avenue, was developed in 1730. It went from Harmer&#x27;s Mill to North Wales Road, which is now Bethlehem Pike. Butler Pike was created in 1739, and went through the town, which was known at that time as the Village of Wissahickon, named after Wissahickon Creek.

The area at the crossroads of Butler and Bethlehem Pike was roughly the village center. It was first known as Gilkey&#x27;s Corner, named for an inn which was built around 1778 and managed by Andrew Gilkinson (or Gilkeson). After 1878, the area was known as &quot;Rose Valley&quot;.

As of 1790, Jonathan Thomas purchased half an acre of land from Gilkinson and sited a tannery at the intersection, causing a nearby creek to be nicknamed &quot;Tannery Run&quot;. As of 1810, the tannery was sold by his son, David Thomas, to Joseph Rutter. As the &quot;Rose Valley Tannery&quot;, it is mentioned as being one of the oldest in the county. It later became the property of Alvin Faust and the firm A. D. Faust Sons.

Between 1750 and 1850, industries developed throughout the watershed, using local waterways to provide power and carry away waste. The area supported nine mills, producing flour, timber, paper and cloth. They are identified by Dr. Mary Hough as Plumly Mill (first owned by William Harmer), Fulling Mill (owned by Andrew and Mary Ambler), Thomson&#x27;s Mill, Reiff Mill, Wertsner Mill, Hague Mill, Burk Mill, a Silk Mill, and a Clover and Chopping and Saw Mill. However, as steam power replaced water power in the 1870s and 1880s, the mills were unable to compete, and were abandoned.

=== Mary Johnson Ambler ===
In 1855, Wissahickon station became a stop on the North Pennsylvania Railroad line. On July 17, 1856, the town was the site of a disastrous train accident, known as the Great Train Wreck of 1856. The northbound &quot;Shackamaxon&quot;, a picnic excursion train, and the southbound &quot;Aramingo&quot; collided head on, killing 59 people instantly, and injuring another 86 passengers. Mary Ambler, a local Quaker resident, walked two miles to the crash site, bringing medical supplies and directing rescue efforts. She turned her house at Tennis Avenue and Main Street into an impromptu hospital for nursing the survivors. Thirteen years later, in 1869, the railway company renamed the station Ambler in her honor. The post office followed suit, and when the borough was formally incorporated on June 16, 1888, it too took the name of Ambler, in honor of Mary Ambler.

=== Keasbey and Mattison ===
In 1881, the Keasbey and Mattison Company, whose business included the manufacture of asbestos, moved to Ambler from Philadelphia. Ambler&#x27;s location along the railroad line was a primary consideration in the location of Keasbey and Mattison Company in Ambler, as it meant that raw asbestos could be easily brought in from Quebec and finished products sent out to markets. Another consideration was the availability of magnesium carbonate, from local dolomite mines. The original K&amp;M factory was built as of 1883.

When the company arrived, the town consisted of &quot;70 houses, 250 residents, a drug store, general store and a few other businesses.&quot; Keasbey and Mattison invested heavily in the town, bringing in Southern Italian stoneworkers to build 400 houses for workers and managers, as well as offices, an opera house, the Trinity Memorial Episcopal Church, and Mattison&#x27;s personal estate, Lindenwold Castle. Many of the Italians stayed in Ambler, helping to form its cultural identity. Maida, Calabria is the town&#x27;s sister city today. The company also employed African Americans, originally from West Virginia, in the less-desirable wet-processing areas of the asbestos plant. They tended to settle in west and south Ambler.

By World War I, Ambler was known as the &quot;asbestos capital of the world&quot;. However, the Great Depression took its toll, and the company was sold to an English concern, Turner &amp; Newall (T&amp;N), in 1934. The plant continued to operate under the K&amp;M name.

In England in 1924, doctors reported the first case of asbestosis, a chronic illness caused by the inhalation of asbestos fibers. By the 1950s, evidence linking asbestos to cancer was mounting. Richard Doll, an epidemiologist at Turner and Newall, reported (in spite of company pressure) that people exposed to asbestos for 20 or more years had a 10 times higher risk of developing lung cancer than the general population. Also, a formerly rare and almost always fatal cancer, mesothelioma, was reported in epidemic proportions near asbestos mines in South Africa. In the 1960s, the &quot;British Journal of Industrial Medicine&quot; indicated that simply living near an asbestos factory, or in an asbestos-insulated building, increased mesothelioma risk.

Turner &amp; Newall operated the factory until it closed in 1962, then sold the property to CertainTeed Corporation and Nicolet Industries. By 1973, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), began to restrict the use of asbestos, stopping the sale of insulation spray in 1973, and of solid asbestos insulation in 1975. In 1974, Nicolet held a competition, offering a $20,000 prize for the proposal of a &quot;feasible commercial application&quot; for its waste chalk piles. Nicolet filed for bankruptcy in 1987. By 1989, most remaining products were banned, under the 1989 Asbestos Ban and Phaseout Rule. Although the Ban was struck down in 1991, few asbestos-based products remain in the domestic marketplace.

Federal-Mogul, an American automotive supplier, purchased the remaining assets of Turner &amp; Newall in 1998. As health concerns about asbestos became widely known, it too found itself in Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to asbestos liability.

=== Legacy of asbestos ===

A 2011 study by the Pennsylvania Department of Health reviewed data from 1992 to 2008, and reported that mesothelioma was diagnosed 3.1 times more often in Ambler residents than in other Pennsylvania residents. The higher rates were attributed to previous asbestos exposure in the factories.

In Ambler, where more than 1.5 million cubic yards of asbestos waste were discarded in a 25-acre area known as the &quot;White Mountains&quot;, contamination remains an issue. From 1973 to 1993 the United States EPA oversaw remediation of the BoRit Asbestos waste dump, also known as the &quot;Ambler Asbestos Piles&quot;. It was proposed to the National Priorities List (NPL) as a Superfund site on October 10, 1984, and formally added to the list as of June 10, 1986. Various remedies were completed as of August 30, 1993 and the site was consequently deleted from the National Priorities List on December 27, 1996, after remediation. The site is reviewed every five years by the EPA.

Local government has made redevelopment of the sites a priority. A 2005 proposal for a 17-story condominium tower was withdrawn after community opposition to the project. One of the concerns was asbestos waste at the location. In 2009 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated the proposed development as part of a second Superfund site, the BoRit Asbestos Site. The site includes an asbestos waste pile, an 11-acre pond and a former park. The EPA estimated that it would complete the initial cleanup phase at the BoRit site as of 2015.

In 2013, Heckendorn Shiles Architects and Summit Realty Advisers successfully converted the derelict factory and smokestack of the Keasbey &amp; Mattison company into a LEED Platinum Certified multi-tenant office building, the Ambler Boiler House. The adaptive reuse project won support from the EPA&#x27;s Brownfields Program and the EnergyWorks program. The renovations cost $16 million, and have resulted in a building with substantial green features including a grey-water system, geothermal energy, solar panels and a reflective roof system, and high-efficiency glass.

==Historic buildings==
Dawesfield was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. During the American Revolutionary War, &quot;Dawesfield&quot; was the property of James Morris, and was used by General George Washington as a headquarters from October 21 to November 20, 1777. James Morris also owned one of the mills in the Ambler area.

The Keasbey-Mattison houses are of interest in part because of the class differences revealed in the construction of different types of houses for workers, supervisors, and administrators, (not to mention Lindenwold Castle, home of Mattison himself.) 


Other buildings of interest, some of which no longer exist, include:

==History==

The villages that have comprised Lower Providence Township since the early eighteenth century include Evansburg, Shannonville (now called Audubon), Eagleville, and Providence Square.

Lower Providence Township is currently bounded on the west by Upper Providence Township, on the northeast by Perkiomen and Worcester townships, on the southeast by West Norriton Township, and on the south by the Schuylkill River. The area of the township is . Red shale predominates in the soils of this part of Montgomery County. Many years ago, lead mines were worked near Perkiomen Creek at Oaks, Pennsylvania, but did not generate profits. The mines were opened in 1800 and were being operated in 1818 by a Mr. Wetherell. The discovery of copper followed that of lead, and in January 1848, the Perkiomen Mining Association was formed. Its land cost about $10,000; much costly machinery was placed in position and a shaft was dug. Many thousands of tons of copper were unearthed over the years until deposits were exhausted.

Shannonville was named after a large, influential family in 1823, when a post office was established there. Jack&#x27;s tavern—the old Bud&#x27;s Bar—was opened here as well. Mr. Shannon was a prosperous pig farmer and hence the town gained the nickname &quot;Hogtown&quot;.

Present-day Audubon was christened in 1899 in honor of early-19th century resident John James Audubon, who resided at Mill Grove, located at the intersection of Audubon and Pawlings Roads.

==Local landmarks==
Audubon lies on the north side of the Schuylkill River across from Valley Forge National Historical Park, and is situated about away from King of Prussia, one of the largest malls in the United States. Local landmarks include:

===Mill Grove===

Built in 1762 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Mill Grove was the first American home of the artist, author and naturalist John James Audubon. Between 1803 and 1806, Mill Grove and its surrounding fields and woodlands first inspired young Audubon&#x27;s passion for painting and drawing birds. Today, the estate serves as an educational center of the National Audubon Society, dedicated to connecting people with nature. A haven for birds and wildlife, the property has more than of trails and views of Perkiomen Creek. The historic three-story stone farmhouse contains a museum displaying original Audubon prints, oil painting, and Audubon memorabilia.

Discouraged by disputes with partners and the failure of the lead mine on the property, Audubon sold Mill Grove. He married Lucy Bakewell Audubon, the daughter of a neighboring landowner, and moved to Kentucky to seek his fortune as a frontier merchant. Mill Grove later became the property of Samuel Wetherill 3rd of Philadelphia, who purchased the property in 1813. It remained in that family for 138 years, when Herbert J. Wetherill sold it in 1951 to Montgomery County. In April 2003 the National Audubon Society and Montgomery County signed an agreement creating the Mill Grove Audubon Center. The center is managed by Audubon Pennsylvania, the state office of the National Audubon Society.

===Walnut Hill (Pawlings Farm)===
The land known as the Perkiomen Peninsula, and particularly the Pawling Farm, played an essential role in the Valley Forge winter encampment of 1777–1778. It provided strategic protection for the camp, serving as the site of the newly commissary function, which saved the Continental Army from starvation, and the site of the encampment itself before the Continental Army marched on to victory at Monmouth.

The peninsula is now a mix of habitats—open meadow, riparian and upland forest, wetlands, and extensive vernal ponds. This is why the Pawling Farm lands provide the best wildlife habitat in the entire park. The park&#x27;s unpaved River Trail runs from the Pawling Bridge to Betzwood, and is a favorite of local residents. The paved Schuylkill River Trail runs along the northern edge of the Pawling Farm. Located on the south side of Apple Valley Lane is a reconstructed stone wall, commissioned by David Lapps and Eileen Moran), from one of the original structures that some of the troops stayed in during the winter of 1777–1778.

===Schuylkill River Trail===
 multiuse trail that runs from Philadelphia to Oaks. It was built on the Pennsylvania Railroad right-of-way and parallels the scenic Schuylkill River as it passes through various townships and boroughs. The trail is a destination for biking, rollerblading, jogging, and walking. It is recognized as a National Recreation Trail by the U.S. Department of Interior&#x27;s National Trails System. Trailheads include Betzwood Park (parking/restrooms), Pawlings Road (parking), Mill Grove, and the Upper Providence Park (parking/restrooms) off Rt. 422 and Egypt Road in Oaks.

===Perkiomen Trail===
The scenic Perkiomen Trail runs through the Perkiomen Creek Valley from its junction with the Schuylkill River Trail at Oaks, Upper Providence Township, to Green Lane Park, the largest county park. Most of the trail is a -wide cinder or stone aggregate (unpaved) surface with grass shoulders. Selected sections are paved where deemed appropriate. The trail is used by walkers, joggers, bicyclists, cross-country skiers, and equestrians.
The trail, developed on a former railroad bed, follows Perkiomen Creek and connects three county parks (Lower Perkiomen Valley Park, Central Perkiomen Valley Park, and Green Lane Park) and two county historic sites (Mill Grove at Audubon Wildlife Sanctuary and Pennypacker Mills). It passes directly through ten municipalities, making connections to numerous municipal parks and open spaces along the scenic waterway. It provides access to Valley Forge National Historical Park via its connection to the Schuylkill River Trail extension.

===Audubon Elementary School===
Located roughly in the center of Audubon, Audubon Elementary school was decommissioned from the late 1980s until the mid-1990s. During that interim period, it housed the town library and a YMCA. In the mid-1990s, it underwent extensive renovation and was reopened to coincide with a large housing boom in the area. On the corner of its property, there is a tree that is at least two centuries old. In 2017, the Methacton School District Board of Education voted to close Audubon Elementary effective July 1, 2017.

===The Club at Shannondell (formerly General Washington Golf and Swim Club)===
Leased from Lower Providence Township by Shannondell Retirement Services around the year 2000, this 18-hole championship golf course features of golf from the tips for a par of 70. The course rating is 69.9, and it has a slope rating of 121 on ryegrass. General Washington golf course opened in 1965. The facility is currently paid for by the taxpayers of Lower Providence who pay a $417K per year mortgage while the township receives $100K per year and receives no profit share or tax revenue from the lease. The facility also includes a family-oriented swim club and upscale family-dining restaurant. A pool membership in 2019 cost $900 for a family.

===Audubon Inn===
This large colonial-era structure is located at the corner of Park Avenue and Egypt Roads, and its proposed demolition was a subject of dispute in a 2005 township rezoning hearing. Currently it houses a law firm, though in the past it has served as a restaurant and inn. The Audubon Inn was bought by a local law firm, and the property behind it bought by CVS.

==Education==

The Methacton School District serves public school students in Audubon. Portions of the Audubon CDP are served by Woodland Elementary School and Arrowhead Elementary School.

Skyview Upper Elementary School, Arcola Intermediate School, and Methacton High School serve all parts of the district. Skyview Upper and Arcola Intermediate are in Trooper CDP, and Methacton High is near the Eagleville CDP but not in it.

<text>In navigation, dead reckoning is the process of calculating the current position of a moving object by using a previously determined position, or fix, and incorporating estimates of speed, heading (or direction or course), and elapsed time. The corresponding term in biology, to describe the processes by which animals update their estimates of position or heading, is path integration.

Advances in navigational aids that give accurate information on position, in particular satellite navigation using the Global Positioning System, have made simple dead reckoning by humans obsolete for most purposes. However, inertial navigation systems, which provide very accurate directional information, use dead reckoning and are very widely applied.

==Etymology==
Contrary to myth, the term &quot;dead reckoning&quot; was not originally used to abbreviate &quot;deduced reckoning&quot;, nor is it a misspelling of the term &quot;ded reckoning&quot;. The use of &quot;ded&quot; or &quot;deduced reckoning&quot; is not known to have appeared earlier than 1931, much later in history than &quot;dead reckoning&quot;, which appeared as early as 1613 in the Oxford English Dictionary. The original intention of &quot;dead&quot; in the term is generally assumed to mean using a stationary object that is &quot;dead in the water&quot; as a basis for calculations. Additionally, at the time the first appearance of &quot;dead reckoning&quot;, &quot;ded&quot; was considered a common spelling of &quot;dead&quot;. This potentially led to later confusion of the origin of the term.

By analogy with their navigational use, the words &quot;dead reckoning&quot; are also used to mean the process of estimating the value of any variable quantity by using an earlier value and adding whatever changes have occurred in the meantime. Often, this usage implies that the changes are not known accurately. The earlier value and the changes may be measured or calculated quantities.

==Errors==
While dead reckoning can give the best available information on the present position with little math or analysis, it is subject to significant errors of approximation. For precise positional information, both speed and direction must be accurately known at all times during travel. Most notably, dead reckoning does not account for directional drift during travel through a fluid medium. These errors tend to compound themselves over greater distances, making dead reckoning a difficult method of navigation for longer journeys.

For example, if displacement is measured by the number of rotations of a wheel, any discrepancy between the actual and assumed traveled distance per rotation, due perhaps to slippage or surface irregularities, will be a source of error. As each estimate of position is relative to the previous one, errors are cumulative, or compounding, over time.

The accuracy of dead reckoning can be increased significantly by using other, more reliable methods to get a new fix part way through the journey. For example, if one was navigating on land in poor visibility, then dead reckoning could be used to get close enough to the known position of a landmark to be able to see it, before walking to the landmark itself—giving a precisely known starting point—and then setting off again.

==Localization of mobile sensor nodes==
Localizing a static sensor node is not a difficult task because attaching a Global Positioning System (GPS) device suffices the need of localization. But a mobile sensor node, which continuously changes its geographical location with time is difficult to localize. Mostly mobile sensor nodes within some particular domain for data collection can be used, &quot;i.e&quot;, sensor node attached to an animal within a grazing field or attached to a soldier on a battlefield. Within these scenarios a GPS device for each sensor node cannot be afforded. Some of the reasons for this include cost, size and battery drainage of constrained sensor nodes.
To overcome this problem a limited number of reference nodes (with GPS) within a field is employed. These nodes continuously broadcast their locations and other nodes in proximity receive these locations and calculate their position using some mathematical technique like trilateration. For localization, at least three known reference locations are necessary to localize. Several localization algorithms based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method have been proposed in literature. Sometimes a node at some places receives only two known locations and hence it becomes impossible to localize. To overcome this problem, dead reckoning technique is used. With this technique a sensor node uses its previous calculated location for localization at later time intervals. For example, at time instant 1 if node A calculates its position as &quot;loca_1&quot; with the help of three known reference locations; then at time instant 2 it uses &quot;loca_1&quot; along with two other reference locations received from other two reference nodes. This not only localizes a node in less time but also localizes in positions where it is difficult to get three reference locations.

==Animal navigation==

In studies of animal navigation, dead reckoning is more commonly (though not exclusively) known as path integration. Animals use it to estimate their current location based on their movements from their last known location. Animals such as ants, rodents, and geese have been shown to track their locations continuously relative to a starting point and to return to it, an important skill for foragers with a fixed home.

==Vehicular navigation==
===Marine===

In marine navigation a &quot;dead&quot; reckoning plot generally does not take into account the effect of currents or wind. Aboard ship a dead reckoning plot is considered important in evaluating position information and planning the movement of the vessel.

Dead reckoning begins with a known position, or fix, which is then advanced, mathematically or directly on the chart, by means of recorded heading, speed, and time. Speed can be determined by many methods. Before modern instrumentation, it was determined aboard ship using a chip log. More modern methods include pit log referencing engine speed (&quot;e.g&quot;. in rpm) against a table of total displacement (for ships) or referencing one&#x27;s indicated airspeed fed by the pressure from a pitot tube. This measurement is converted to an equivalent airspeed based upon known atmospheric conditions and measured errors in the indicated airspeed system. A naval vessel uses a device called a pit sword (rodmeter), which uses two sensors on a metal rod to measure the electromagnetic variance caused by the ship moving through water. This change is then converted to ship&#x27;s speed. Distance is determined by multiplying the speed and the time. This initial position can then be adjusted resulting in an estimated position by taking into account the current (known as set and drift in marine navigation). If there is no positional information available, a new dead reckoning plot may start from an estimated position. In this case subsequent dead reckoning positions will have taken into account estimated set and drift.

Dead reckoning positions are calculated at predetermined intervals, and are maintained between fixes. The duration of the interval varies. Factors including one&#x27;s speed made good and the nature of heading and other course changes, and the navigator&#x27;s judgment determine when dead reckoning positions are calculated.

Before the 18th-century development of the marine chronometer by John Harrison and the lunar distance method, dead reckoning was the primary method of determining longitude available to mariners such as Christopher Columbus and John Cabot on their trans-Atlantic voyages. Tools such as the traverse board were developed to enable even illiterate crew members to collect the data needed for dead reckoning. Polynesian navigation, however, uses different wayfinding techniques.

===Air===


On 14 June, 1919, John Alcock and Arthur Brown took off from Lester&#x27;s Field in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland in a Vickers Vimy. They navigated across the Atlantic Ocean by dead reckoning and landed in County Galway, Ireland at 8:40 a.m. on 15 June completing the first non-stop transatlantic flight. 

On 21 May 1927 Charles Lindbergh landed in Paris, France after a successful non-stop flight from the United States in the single-engined &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;. As the aircraft was equipped with very basic instruments, Lindbergh used dead reckoning to navigate.

Dead reckoning in the air is similar to dead reckoning on the sea, but slightly more complicated. The density of the air the aircraft moves through affects its performance as well as winds, weight, and power settings.

The basic formula for DR is Distance = Speed x Time. An aircraft flying at 250 knots airspeed for 2 hours has flown 500 nautical miles through the air. The wind triangle is used to calculate the effects of wind on heading and airspeed to obtain a magnetic heading to steer and the speed over the ground (groundspeed). Printed tables, formulae, or an E6B flight computer are used to calculate the effects of air density on aircraft rate of climb, rate of fuel burn, and airspeed.

A course line is drawn on the aeronautical chart along with estimated positions at fixed intervals (say every half hour). Visual observations of ground features are used to obtain fixes. By comparing the fix and the estimated position corrections are made to the aircraft&#x27;s heading and groundspeed.

Dead reckoning is on the curriculum for VFR (visual flight rules – or basic level) pilots worldwide. It is taught regardless of whether the aircraft has navigation aids such as GPS, ADF and VOR and is an ICAO Requirement. Many flying training schools will prevent a student from using electronic aids until they have mastered dead reckoning.

Inertial navigation systems (INSes), which are nearly universal on more advanced aircraft, use dead reckoning internally. The INS provides reliable navigation capability under virtually any conditions, without the need for external navigation references, although it is still prone to slight errors.

===Automotive===
Dead reckoning is today implemented in some high-end automotive navigation systems in order to overcome the limitations of GPS/GNSS technology alone. Satellite microwave signals are unavailable in parking garages and tunnels, and often severely degraded in urban canyons and near trees due to blocked lines of sight to the satellites or multipath propagation. In a dead-reckoning navigation system, the car is equipped with sensors that know the wheel circumference and record wheel rotations and steering direction. These sensors are often already present in cars for other purposes (anti-lock braking system, electronic stability control) and can be read by the navigation system from the controller-area network bus. The navigation system then uses a Kalman filter to integrate the always-available sensor data with the accurate but occasionally unavailable position information from the satellite data into a combined position fix.

==Autonomous navigation in robotics==
Dead reckoning is utilized in some robotic applications. It is usually used to reduce the need for sensing technology, such as ultrasonic sensors, GPS, or placement of some linear and rotary encoders, in an autonomous robot, thus greatly reducing cost and complexity at the expense of performance and repeatability. The proper utilization of dead reckoning in this sense would be to supply a known percentage of electrical power or hydraulic pressure to the robot&#x27;s drive motors over a given amount of time from a general starting point. Dead reckoning is not totally accurate, which can lead to errors in distance estimates ranging from a few millimeters (in CNC machining) to kilometers (in UAVs), based upon the duration of the run, the speed of the robot, the length of the run, and several other factors.

==Pedestrian dead reckoning==
With the increased sensor offering in smartphones, built-in accelerometers can be used as a pedometer and built-in magnetometer as a compass heading provider. Pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) can be used to supplement other navigation methods in a similar way to automotive navigation, or to extend navigation into areas where other navigation systems are unavailable.

In a simple implementation, the user holds their phone in front of them and each step causes position to move forward a fixed distance in the direction measured by the compass. Accuracy is limited by the sensor precision, magnetic disturbances inside structures, and unknown variables such as carrying position and stride length. Another challenge is differentiating walking from running, and recognizing movements like bicycling, climbing stairs, or riding an elevator.

Before phone-based systems existed, many custom PDR systems existed. While a pedometer can only be used to measure linear distance traveled, PDR systems have an embedded magnetometer for heading measurement. Custom PDR systems can take many forms including special boots, belts, and watches, where the variability of carrying position has been minimized to better utilize magnetometer heading. True dead reckoning is fairly complicated, as it is not only important to minimize basic drift, but also to handle different carrying scenarios and movements, as well as hardware differences across phone models.

==Directional dead reckoning==

The south-pointing chariot was an ancient Chinese device consisting of a two-wheeled horse-drawn vehicle which carried a pointer that was intended always to aim to the south, no matter how the chariot turned. The chariot pre-dated the navigational use of the magnetic compass, and could not &quot;detect&quot; the direction that was south. Instead it used a kind of directional dead reckoning: at the start of a journey, the pointer was aimed southward by hand, using local knowledge or astronomical observations e.g. of the Pole Star. Then, as it traveled, a mechanism possibly containing differential gears used the different rotational speeds of the two wheels to turn the pointer relative to the body of the chariot by the angle of turns made (subject to available mechanical accuracy), keeping the pointer aiming in its original direction, to the south. Errors, as always with dead reckoning, would accumulate as distance traveled increased.

== For networked games ==
Networked games and simulation tools routinely use dead reckoning to predict where an actor should be right now, using its last known kinematic state (position, velocity, acceleration, orientation, and angular velocity). This is primarily needed because it is impractical to send network updates at the rate that most games run, 60 Hz. The basic solution starts by projecting into the future using linear physics:

formula_1

This formula is used to move the object until a new update is received over the network. At that point, the problem is that there are now two kinematic states: the currently estimated position and the just received, actual position. Resolving these two states in a believable way can be quite complex. One approach is to create a curve (e.g. cubic Bézier splines, centripetal Catmull–Rom splines, and Hermite curves) between the two states while still projecting into the future. Another technique is to use projective velocity blending, which is the blending of two projections (last known and current) where the current projection uses a blending between the last known and current velocity over a set time.

* formula_2
* formula_3
* formula_4
* formula_5

The first equation calculates a blended velocity formula_6 given the client-side velocity at the time of the last server update formula_7 and the last known server-side velocity formula_8. This essentially blends from the client-side velocity towards the server-side velocity for a smooth transition. Note that formula_9 should go from zero (at the time of the server update) to one (at the time at which the next update should be arriving). A late server update is unproblematic as long as formula_9 remains at one.

Next, two positions are calculated: firstly, the blended velocity formula_6 and the last known server-side acceleration formula_12 are used to calculate formula_13. This is a position which is projected from the client-side start position formula_14 based on formula_15, the time which has passed since the last server update. Secondly, the same equation is used with the last known server-side parameters to calculate the position projected from the last known server-side position formula_16 and velocity formula_8, resulting in formula_18.

Finally, the new position to display on the client formula_19 is the result of interpolating from the projected position based on client information formula_13 towards the projected position based on the last known server information formula_18. The resulting movement smoothly resolves the discrepancy between client-side and server-side information, even if this server-side information arrives infrequently or inconsistently. It is also free of oscillations which spline-based interpolation may suffer from.

==Computer science==
In computer science, dead-reckoning refers to navigating an array data structure using indexes. Since every array element has the same size, it is possible to directly access one array element by knowing any position in the array.

Given the following array:

knowing the memory address where the array starts, it is easy to compute the memory address of D:

formula_22

Likewise, knowing D&#x27;s memory address, it is easy to compute the memory address of B:

formula_23

This property is particularly important for performance when used in conjunction with arrays of structures because data can be directly accessed, without going through a pointer dereference.

== Points of interest ==

=== Bryn Athyn Historic District ===
The Bryn Athyn Historic District, a National Historic Landmark District, includes four historic buildings:

* Cairnwood Estate was built as a family home for the industrialist John Pitcairn and his wife Gertrude. The building was designed by renowned architectural firm Carrère and Hastings, and the surrounding grounds were designed by Charles Eliot of the landscape design firm Olmsted, Olmsted and Eliot. The building was eventually donated to the Academy of the New Church, and now serves as a special events facility.
* Bryn Athyn Cathedral serves as the episcopal seat of the General Church of the New Jerusalem, an international Swedenborgian church. Bryn Athyn Cathedral, built in the early 20th century, is renowned for its stained glass collection and for its unusual architecture, which follows the arts and crafts tradition. Its construction was financed by John Pitcairn, and supervised by his son, Raymond Pitcairn.
* Glencairn was originally the private residence of millionaire philanthropist Raymond Pitcairn. The castle-like building now serves the Academy of the New Church and Bryn Athyn College as Glencairn Museum, housing a collection of mostly religious artwork and artifacts from around the world and is open to the public.
* Cairncrest was built as a home for John Pitcairn&#x27;s son, Harold Pitcairn, an aviation pioneer and developer of the autogyro. The building now serves as the central administrative offices for the General Church of the New Jerusalem.

=== Academy of the New Church and Bryn Athyn College ===
Bryn Athyn is also the site of the General Church affiliated Academy of the New Church, which is the parent organization of the Academy of the New Church Secondary Schools, Bryn Athyn College, a divinity school, and the Swedenborg Library (which was named in honor of Emanuel Swedenborg, whose writings constitute the doctrine of the New Church).

==Transportation==
===Roads and highways===

As of 2006 there were of public roads in Bryn Athyn, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the borough.

The only numbered highway serving Bryn Athyn is Pennsylvania Route 232, which follows Huntingdon Pike on a north-south route through the borough. Byberry Road, the only other road of significance, passes along the northern and northeastern edges of the borough.

===SEPTA service===

Bryn Athyn had commuter train service until January 14, 1983. Service was suspended due to failing train equipment resulting in a lack of ridership. As of 2017, the train station is used as the Bryn Athyn post office.

Though rail service was initially replaced with a Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus, patronage remained light. The replacement bus service was far slower and less convenient than the train service it replaced, resulting in the shuttle bus being very unpopular. The travelling public never saw a bus service as a suitable replacement for a rail service.

In the ensuing years, there has been interest in resuming passenger service by Bucks County officials. Neighboring Montgomery County officials are supportive of re-thinking the rail corridor as well, though the belief within SEPTA management is that the section through Lorimer Park and Walnut Hill Station (the only sparsely populated section along the railway) will never generate enough riders to be feasible.

In September 2009, the Southampton-based Pennsylvania Transit Expansion Coalition (PA-TEC) began discussions with township officials along the railway, as well as SEPTA officials, about the realistic possibility of resuming even minimal passenger service to relieve traffic congestion in the region. Plans call for completing the electrification to Newtown, as originally planned in the late 1970s. Both Bucks and Montgomery County officials, as well as state representatives, have been receptive to PA-TEC&#x27;s efforts, despite SEPTA&#x27;s overall reservations. However, SEPTA has also confirmed that they are indeed open to revisiting the line if there is strong political support in both counties.

All plans for resuming the train service were dropped in 2014 when Montgomery County officials decided to extend the Pennypack Trail over the derelict rail bed.

SEPTA operates the Route 24 bus, a bus that goes from Frankford Transportation Center in Northeast Philadelphia to Southampton. The Route 24 bus goes along Huntingdon Pike while in Bryn Athyn.

===1921 wreck===
On December 5, 1921, two Reading Railroad passenger steam trains collided head-on on a blind curve. The impact sent red-hot coals flying forward from each engine, raining down on the wooden passenger cars of the oncoming train. Twenty-seven people were killed and some 70 injured. Most of those killed had burned to death, in part because the wooden cars had burned so quickly and also because of the inability of rescue workers to get access to the trains, which were wedged between the rock walls of a cut through hilly and wooded terrain without road access for fire equipment. The incident led to a ban on the use of wooden rail cars in order to prevent future disasters of a similar nature.

==Public education==
The Bryn Athyn borough is within the Bryn Athyn School District, which does not operate any public schools. The district website cites the small number of children within the borough enrolled in public schools.

90% of school age children attend private schools within the district and the remainder are homeschooled or attend schools in neighboring districts.

==Notable people==
* Stephen Gyllenhaal, director and father of Maggie and Jake Gyllenhaal
* Harold Frederick Pitcairn, aviation inventor and pioneer

<doc id="133348" wikidata="Q1131352" url="?curid=133348" title="Collegeville, Pennsylvania">
<text>Collegeville is a borough in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, a suburb outside of Philadelphia on Perkiomen Creek. Collegeville was incorporated in 1896. It is the location of Ursinus College, which opened in 1869. The population was 5,089 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The area which is present day Collegeville was part of the original William Penn purchase of &quot;All the land lying on the Pahkehoma&quot; in 1684. In 1799, Perkiomen Bridge was constructed using funds raised from a special lottery approved by the Pennsylvania Legislature. When the first post office in this area was established in 1847, it was called Perkiomen Bridge. In 1832, the first school for primary and secondary students was established as Todd&#x27;s School. It was later renamed Freeland Public School in 1844. In 1848, Henry A. Hunsicker built the &quot;Freeland Seminary of Perkiomen Bridge.&quot; The village around the school became known as Freeland. In 1851, Abraham Hunsicker – Henry&#x27;s son – established the Pennsylvania Female College near present-day Glenwood Avenue. Ten years later, in 1861, the post office was moved and renamed Freeland.

When the trains first arrived in the area in 1868, there was a debate about naming of the station (Perkiomen Bridge vs Freeland). The local citizens acquired notoriety when they burned down the toll booth on the Perkiomen Bridge and threw the gate into the river. The rail company avoided any troubles by naming it &quot;Collegeville&quot; (the station was actually closer to the Pennsylvania Female College than either Freeland School or Perkiomen Bridge). Ursinus College was founded a year later in 1869. Thus the name &quot;Collegeville&quot; precedes the establishment of Ursinus College and it is actually named after the other 4-year liberal arts college (Pennsylvania Female College) which closed in 1880. Collegeville was incorporated as borough in 1896.

The Perkiomen Bridge and Perkiomen Bridge Hotel are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
